      Just a few more days until the challenge.  I'm alternating between being excited and nervous.  Excited at the changes I might be making in my body, and nervous that this will be just another wieght loss program that I fail. BLEH.  I'm REALLY excited about joining a gym though.  I've desided to do that instead of trying to work out at home.  Now I'll just have to work on getting my lazy butt out of bed in the mornings and go there!  Of course having my sweetheart poke me in the mornings will help, as I'm planning to drag him along with me! 6 days!  Weight today - 186

      Let me start by saying - spelling is not my best subject, and if creativity in the execution of the English language offends you.  Then move right along, and don't spend much time here.  I promise to do my best, but there will be times when I'm in a hurry, and won't run the spell check as I should have.  For those moments, I appoligize in advance.  As for what this is for?  Well, I've struggled my whole life with my weight.  I've tried off and on for what has seemed my entire existance to have the body I would like, and though I'm doing better now then in years past, I'm still far from my goals.  And so, I've started yet another weightloss journey.  This one called Body for Life.  This is a weight training and nutrition program that involves a lot of commitment and a great deal of work.  As part of this program, there is a 12 week program.  A "Challenge" they call it.  And it's this challenge that brings me here.  My hope is to journal my journey through this challenge and hopefully motivate myself to complete this challenge.  Of course, loosing weight and getting into shape is one of my goals as well.    The actual challenge doesn't start until Jan 6th, and until then I'm trying to loose the two pounds I put on at Christmas, and survive the New Year and my birthday - modist Goals, but there they are!

      Another great day yesterday, and I'm feeling grand.  The only fly in the ointment is that I checked the "Protien drink" that I drinking in the mornings and discovered it is a "Meal Replacement Drink" with 27 Carbs per serving!  Gack! The good news is that I've only been drinking it for two days.  No wonder I liked it so much!  So, I skipped the drink and had some eggs for breakfast.  I guess it back to finding a protien drink I can stomach.  I liked having that convienance in the mornings.  I liked the premade drinks from EAS, so maybe I'll look for the powdered form for my morning meal.  I'm SO glad that today will be a 'rest' day for my workout.  My calves are SCREAMING at me!  I got up in the middle of the night last night and found I couldn't straiten my legs.  I had to hobble to the bathroom.  I knew I had overdone my calf workout, I just didn't know how much until last night.  Other then that... the workout last night was GREAT.  I ran/walked my 1.5 miles in 21 minutes and still managed to hit a 10 on that workout.  I'm continuing to take my weight workout easy.. not going for the 10 yet... it's obvious that if I had worked the rest of my body the way I had my calves that I wouldn't be able to get out of bed this morning.  Maybe I'll add a body part at a time and take it to failure.  It's a thought.  All other parts of the day were great too.. food was good, water great.. got 8 hours of sleep... another 5 star day!  I had to battle the cravings monster lastnight when I went to clean up the leftover cookie dough.  I LOVE to eat cookie dough and could almost taiste it!  Instead I chugged some water and filled the bowl full of water.  It didn't look so appitizing after that.    My darling Fiance informed me this morning that he's gained 2 lbs already :)  I'm hearing dance lessons in my future.  In the mean while, I'm signing up for ballet classes, and adding that to my workout schedule.  I took ballet for 8 years as a kid and am looking forward to doing it again.  So, my goals for today are: Stay under 20 carb grams Journal my intake 10 minutes of pilates REST 62 oz of water less then 62 oz of soda Read some more success stories to stay modivated I already took my vitamins I plan to get 8 hours of sleep  weight today - STILL 189... but I'm getting stronger already, I can tell!

      Let me start off with a great big.. Wooo hoooo!  I had a GREAT day yesterday, and I've continued the trend so far today.  I think I had a 5 star day! :)  Let's calculate, shall we?  Food - Journaled, and of good nutrition.   Exercise - Lower Body workout, 1.5 miles ran, 10 minutes of pilates, and all journaled. Hydration - drank 62+oz of water, and had 52 oz of soda Attitude - journaled (a lot!) and got some motivation off the net Energy - 8 hours of sleep and took my vitamins  Yep it was a five star day!!    I took it a little easy on the weights.. until I did calfs then I overdid it a bit.  My legs were shaking when I was done with that.  By the time I got to the treadmill my legs were rather tired, but I still managed to get 1.6 miles in 23 minutes.  Not the three miles I had hoped for, but it has been a long time since I tried to run seriously.  The best news was even though my legs were VERY tired, I got out of bed and was able to put full weight on my foot this morning.  No pain!    I've managed to bypass several temptations today as well.  The cravings hit when I drove through Burger King for a soda.  Boy those cini-minis looked good! and then at lunch when I got my car cleaned they had these chocolate cresaunts that made me look twice.   But I kept my goals in mind... #1 to kick my DFs butt in the complition we're having.  First one to lose 10 lbs is the winner.. and if I win.. I get dance lessons for the two of us!  Needless to say that's quite a motivator for me.  We're also talking about a small pay off for each day one of us goes to the gym and the other didn't.  He's going to owe me SO big. :)  My goal today is another 5 star day...  I've done good in food and journalling -  Tonight I'm going to the gym for a upper body workout, an 1.5 mile run.  And then later 10 minutes of yoga.  to be documented of course! I need to get started on my water, but I've stopped drinking soda for the day.  I think I'm finally at a good point in that addiction.  I'll maybe work to eliminate that entirely eventually, but one step at a time.  I'm going to stop somewhere and check out some success stories for some motivation as soon as I'm done here.  I already took my vitamins and I'm planning on 8 hours of sleep.. :)  Yay me!   Oh, and I'm down 1 lb since yesterday.. I KNEW I was feeling lighter.

      I just have to say that my Fiance is the best! I talked to him today about my frustration with my motivation and he immediatly stepped up to the challenge.  We're working right now to come up with some goals and rewards and we're going to keep each other on track.  I don't know what I would do without him!   I've also desided that one of my goals each day is going to be to read something inspirational, or motivational - it doesn't have to be wieght related, but I've found that reading the success stories on the various web sites has done much to lift my spirts and renew my 'can do' attitude.  AND - I've been a good girl food wise today.  It's 4:00pm and I'm still feeling pretty energized.  I'm working on my first bottle of water, have journaled all my food, and have a date with my DF (Darling Fiance) at the gym tonight, so I'm looking forward to having a 5 star day! Umm.. or maybe I need to come up with some sort of raiting system.  Let me think about this.  Here are areas where I can struggle or do well...   Food  - journal  - nutrition Excercise  - Weight training  - Marathon Training  - Stretching  - Journal Hydration  - 62 oz of water  - Less then 62oz of Diet Soda Attitude  - Journal  - Motivational Reading Energy  - 8 hours of sleep  - Vitamins  So that's 5 areas At the begining of each day I'm going to evaluate the day before and give each day a number of stars -  So far today  I've got 1 Star for food as I've been journaling and eating nutritionally sound -- a 0 for exercise, but I've got a plan in place to make that a 1 as well -- a .5 for Hydration as I've only had 52 oz of soda, and I'm on my way to another .5 as I guzzle my water -- Attitude is a a slam dunk for a one because I've done nothing but journal and look for motivation today -- Energy, well I have a .5 there as I took my Vitamins, and hopefully I'll get 8 hours of sleep tonight.  I think I like this!  Oh, and I can already tell I'm eating better today.  I feel lighter, and just.. BETTER already.

      I don't know what happens to my energy levels.  I really do need to get in to the lab and get my blood work done.  Yesterday I was feeling grand, looking forward to going to the gym, and then, by the time I got home I was exhausted and it was only 5:30! Needless to say I didn't make it to they gym.  I used the excuse that it would have been awkward with my fiance's car in the shop, but I could have made it work if I had really wanted to.  It reminds me a little of the bible verse that says something like...  I know the things that I must do, and yet I do not do them... it certainly applies here.  I just another of those 'educated' fat chicks.  I know what I need to do.  I know the things that will make the changes in my body, and yet... somehow I always manage not to do them.  It's really nothing more then lazyness.  Well, lazyness and a love for food... *sigh*  BUT, today's a new day.  A day when I can do the things I must do.  I'm three weeks into this challenge with nothing to show for it, but a gym membership and a cupboard full of vitamins.  But, on the other hand, there are over 8 weeks left in this challenge.  Still time to make some major changes for the better, do be one step closer to the lifestyle that "I" want.    I just had an idea.  You see, although I know that I am at an unhealthy weight I really don't think I look that bad.  I never had issues with the opposite sex, and my fiance makes it very clear that he loves me the way I am.  In fact he worries that my goals might be too stringent and that I might get too skinny.  My Dr, though has made it clear she wants me to loose weight, as she's worried that it may begin to effect my health.  It was she who suggested I alter my eating habits toward a lower carb lifestyle.  I did that and have lost SOME weight, but as always I've stalled around the 185 mark.  But, I think one of the reasons I've stalled is that I'm trying to reach other peoples goals.  Loosing weight because my Dr, or society tells me I need to.  Intellegently I know that my health will suffer unless I make some changes, but that doesn't seem to matter when I come home tired after a day of work, or when someone announces that there are paistries in the break room.  Still, there are some things that I want to change.  I'm tired of being tired.  I hate that I wake up exhaused.  I know that healthier eating, and exercise is supposed to change that.  So, I need to come up with goals for ME... yes, reaching 130 is a goal for me, but it's not priority... it's not enough to make me change... But perhaps some other things will.  My wish list  1 - To have more energy 2 - Run a Marathon 3 - Wear size 8 4 -   I think I'll continue to add to this list and perhaps ever post it up somewhere.  There has got to be something out there that will motivate me!!

      Back in the saddle again.... Everyone sing with me! Back in the saddle again!  That time of the month hit me, and I couldn't seem to put enough food in my mouth.  I blew it BIG time.  The good news is, I'm ready to start, again.  One good thing that's happened is that I finally got my gym membership.  Horray! Another step in the right direction is that I've cut WAY back on my diet soda intake AND I've gotten a good supply of all the vitamins I think I'll need.  It's a little daunting to look at that handful of pills, but I've been taking them for several days and I think I might be starting to feel a difference.    So, I'm wondering.  Is there anyone out there?  Am I talking to myself?  I'm wondering if posting a food log might help me stay honest.  I think I'll try it.  So, if there IS anyone out there, check up on me, and help me stay on the right track.  I'll be going to the gym tonight for the first time as an 'offical' member.  It's the middle of the week, but I'm going to start where I should be - 20 minutes of aerobics.  I'm going to try to get up early in the morning to work out, but I'm NOT a morning person so it make take a while for my energy level to go up, then I'll think about morning workouts.    One of the things I'm struggling with, is that last year I set a goal of doing a marathon this year.  I had started training, until I strained the arch of my foot, and I had to stay off of it for a while.  I got treatment, and I'm feeling pretty good.  I even ran on my foot and was pain free.  But, the BFL FAQ suggests that you NOT do the program while training for a marathon.  If I'm going to do a marathon this year, it will mean starting training now...  The good news is that my current training level is light.  It probably falls within the 20 minute aerobic workout even...  But I may have to modify the BFL program as the training progresses. (provided my foot holds up to the strain)   Lastly - I want to publically state my current "short term" goal.  On May 3rd 2003 I plan to be at or below 160lbs.  That's an obtainable rate of 2/lbs per week.  Of course that means sticking with my program.  But I KNOW I can do this.  I finally feel like I have all the pieces in place.  And, as I said before, the addded motivation of a wedding in 2004.  I picked May3rd because that will be the second anniversary of meeting my fiance, but it is also 1 year before our wedding date.  That will give me 1 year to get off the final 30 lbs.  That's doable right?  I figure with me loosing weight and he coming to the gym to workout, we should have to problem getting over the threshold.   So, my "to-do's" for today - 1) Link an on-line food journal on this page. 2) Hit the gym for a 20 minutes aerobic solution - (at least 2 miles per marathon training) 3) 10 minutes of Yoga for today's stretching

      Well, I know I've been quiet, but things are going really well.  I haven't done as well on the excercise as I would like, but I'll be getting my gym membership soon, and that's going to make things a LOT easier.  Food wise I've been doing REALLY well though.  The weight is dropping and that's what really counts.  My plan so far is to eat when I'm hungry, and not get too full.  I'm drinking too much soda still, and I'll be working on that next.  But one hurdle at a time.  I'll probably not be making some glorious transformation in the next 12 weeks, but I expect I'll be making some major changes.  For now, I'm feeling better each day.

      Day two!  I feel GREAT!  I got up and went to the gym this morning.  I paid the day fee so that I could run on the tredmill and do my cardio workout for the day.  It felt SO good, I am still feeling the high.  I really have to remember this feeling everytime I'm laying there making excuses for not getting out of bed.  Eventually, I'm hoping to feel this good after my weight workout, but we'll see.  The rest of yesterday went good.  I got 5 meals in, no problem, and feel as though I really stuck to the plan.  I'm feeling really strong and alert today, so maybe the good food is making a difference already.  I do need to get cracking on taking my vits though.  Taking pills has never been my strong spot, so I'll have to work on making that a habit.  I'm also planning on getting all my blood work done tomorrow.  Just one more way to measure my progress.  The only thing I haven't done, and don't know when I will get to it, is figuring my body fat percentage.  I saw a website once that figured it using the Navy's method, maybe I'll look for that again.    Weight Today: 185

      I know that in order to make positive changes in your life, you have to start with changing your mind.  This seems to be my major struggle right now.  For some reason I'm having trouble convincing my brain that it's possable for a woman, 50 lbs overweight is capable of making major changes in her appearance in only 12 weeks.  12 weeks, 3 months, 84 days - This is the time limit I've given myself to make noticable changes in my physique.  I sit here remembering the lumpy body that graced my before photos, and I find myself doubting.  So, where do I go to find proof?  I'm an american, and a child of the 80's.  We want our results and we want it NOW.  It's not enough to just know I'm doing good, I want proof.  I know that these are the thoughts that I need to overcome in order to make it through these 12 weeks.  Otherwise I WILL faulter.  The thing is, I have to deside NOW that I won't quit.  I guess that's the key.  Make the promise to myself not to give up, and then sticking with it.  We'll see, it's a little hard to belive right now.

      Today's the day!  I really wonder about myself sometimes, as yesterday I was already ready to quit, and I hadn't even started yet!  But, I pushed on, got my shopping done, and pictures taken and so far, I've been on track.  I was a little discouraged because I havn't gotten my gym membership straightened out yet, but I set up my total gym before going to bed last night and made it work for my workout this morning.  Because I'm so terribly out of shape I desided to go easy at first, so instead of doing the full five sets I only did four, and I didn't increment my weights because it's very cumbersome to do on the total gym.  I'm a little dissapointed that I'm not doing the whole program (My all or nothing attitude raising it's head) but this is better then doing nothing.  I have to admit my pictures last night were VERY inspirational.  There is no way I can look at those and NOT do SOMETHING!   I know I'm 50 lbs overweight, but I rarely see it.  The pictures really opened my eyes!  All my planning is paying off though, as today's meals are all in place, and I've got three meals sitting in my lunch bag ready for later.  I think I might have eaten too much at breakfast, but I guess I'll see how things go.  I am a little bummed because Ieft my water bottle at home, but luckily we've got a soda machine here that has water in it, so I'll be able to improvise.  It's almost time for my second meal!  Weight today - 186

      I've  been trying to set myself some mini goals before the start of this challenge, and have found myself failing misserably.  I really need to work on being prepared for the next day so that I don't have excuses for straying from the path. The good news is, I have new motivation for loosing weight.  The new year started with a proposal, and I'm now engaged.  With a tenative wedding date of May 3rd 2004, I think that will give me pleanty of time to get a bikini body before we go to Hawaii to tie the knot.  4 days until the start of the challenge and I'm doing all I can to get/stay motivated!  Weight today - 185.5

      Hmmm.. I can't believe it's been a week since I've checked in.  I had a pretty good week so far.  a decent upper and lower body workout.  Two good days of treadmill work, and a 5 mile hike on Saturday.  I have even been doing well on my food.. until Sunday when my Fiance brought home a loaf of french bread he won at the checkout counter while picking up some diet soda.  Oh it was SO good! but I got up this morning and the scale said 190!! *sob* I know I'm toning, and that my body is getting stronger.  I'm actually seeing an improvement in my energy levels and I think I'm losing inches.  but... 190 lbs! I have to say that that number has motivated me even MORE to hit the gym tonight.  I think I'm ready to start pushing my workouts to a level 10.. I just hope I don't overdo it.  I got an email from someone (Yay someone actually reads this!) Thank you for the suggestions for drinks.  I found the EAS Advant Edge "Carb Control" drinks seem to be doing the trick for me.  They are quick, taste ok, don't seem to upset my stomach, and only have 2 grams of carbs.  :)  One in the afternoon about 3:00 seems to hold me over until after my workout, so I'm satisfied.  For anyone looking for a "sweet treat" I have discovered Sugar Free italian sodas.  English Toffee, Carmel, Amareto... Throw them in the blender with some ice and milk and WALA a milk-shake tasting drink  I'm sure there's a way to throw some protien powder in there to make it a little more 'legal'  I make mine with whipping cream to keep a handle on the carbs.  I must remember to take measurements tonight....

      My weekend started fine, and then dissolved into a two day long 'free day' :| BUT, I am down to 187.5... I can finally walk across the room without pain, so tonight I hope to do my lower body work out again.  I'm going to be a lot more careful about my calf workout though!  Not much else to report.  I'm feeling confident, and better physically and mentally, even if my body isn't showing a great deal of improvement yet.  I'll give it time.

      I finally found the time to finish entering my food intake.  No wonder I woke up starving this morning!  I only had a little over 1000 calories!  My weight keeps dropping so fast I'm almost frightened, I just hope it doesn't rocket back up again.  I was down 2 more pounds this morning.  Though I did weigh late.  I'm still wating a week to try to get a baseline on my body fat percentage.  I took pictures last night too, and I'm not looking forward to getting them back.  I mean, I 'know' how bad I look but to really 'see' it - it's not going to be fun.   I haven't been drinking as much water as I should, but I'm working up to changing 1 bad habit at a time.  I also bought a - 'kit' I guess is the best thing to call it.  Some CD's and some flash cards that I'm going to use to start doing Pilates.  I may just start that tomorrow.

      Well, I made it through the day, and it guess overall it wasn't too bad.  Compared to what was a 'normal' day before this it was down right excelent.  My body's still dumping water weight, because I'm down another pound today - 199.5  I wish it could always be this easy!  I keep wondering what it would be like to know I could reach my goal weight in two months.. HEH.  Oh well... Next year will have to be soon enough.  And maybe, I'll deside I'm happy with my body before then.  Many of the girls I see, who's body I like, arn't at thier 'goal' weight so maybe I don't have far to go as I would think.  I just need to get through this first 12 weeks!  Overall I'm doing fairly well with my eating.  I even got into the cookies last night and instead of eating them, grabbed a handfull of them and put them in a bag in the freezer.  Knowing I was storing them away for my free day was almost as satifying as eating them outright.  ALMOST.  I'm going to keep doing that when I'm tempted.. hopefully the freezer won't get too full!

      Dinner was not good!!  I was really hungry and everything looked so good!  I really overdid it.  At least it seems like I did when I put it on paper, but I don't feel overstuffed physically.  I guess it's just going to take a while to break all these old habits.  I'm glad that I'm not starting my 'offical' challenge until next week.  Hopefully I will be adjusted by then.  Either that or I'll have totally given up.  I hope NOT the latter.  I guess I just had to get on here and confess.  Make sure that this wasn't an excuse to binge.

      I've spent a lot of time on the web today.  Looking for ideas and inspiration.  I think I may have found it in the MSN groups.  I found a group of women who are doing the BFL challenge and doing challenges between themselves!  I joined and I can't wait to see the difference I can make in 12 weeks.  I pretty much have the eating down.  I don't think that's going to be an issue for me.  I've started two food journals and (well it HAS only been two days) I've been keeping up on them.  I'm actually encoraged by how well I've been doing so far.  I know to REALLY do this challenge I need to figure out my workout.  I'm going to start on the 4th in earnest (the begining of the challenge)  Until then I have time to workout a workout.  I have a total gym at home so I'll probably use that for my weight workout.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do for cardio though since I can't see to get past the injury to my foot.  I need to find something I can do intervals with, as well as something that low impact.  Help?  Anyone?

      It's morning - I made it through 1 entire day.  1 down 83 to go.  I'm hoping that eventually I get a burst of energy, and some motivation and start to feel some HOPE.  At the moment I just feel so let down.  Everything I've tried has failed... I just don't want this to fail too.  I stopped at curves this morning to look around.  They offered me a really good deal, wich I liked, but I got mad at the high pressure sale techniques.  "Buy now or forget it"  Needless to say, I left without buying.    The good news is, I dropped two pounds since yesterday.  I know it's just water weight.. etc etc.  But if felt good to see it non-the-less.  I also took my measurements last night and started a chart of my body fat % so that I'm ready for whatever losses come my way.  I know I'm going to need to excercise to REALLY see results, but for now I'm just willing to see ANY bit of loss.  So, I'm trying to figure out my goals for this first 12 weeks - First of all - I want to be down to 177lbs. and about 46% Body Fat.  I also want to be down to (almost) a size 12.  Hmmm.  Just thinking that might be possible is encoraging to me.  12 weeks to a size 12? I wonder if I can do that.  It's certainly motivating to try.  At the moment I'm tracking EVERYTHING. what I eat, when I eat, why I eat, and how I feel after.  That way if I start to slide I'll hopefully see why.  maybe this will help me get a handle on my binges, cravings and emotional eating.  Can't hurt.  I just have to stay diciplined and stay on it.    Well, that's it for now.

      Well, it looks like I made it through the day.  I ate 6 small meals and stayed on plan.  I wish I felt better about it, but at the moment I just feel hungry.  I'm pretty sure I need to drink more water.  Perhaps that's where my hunger is coming from.  But, I did make it through the day.  One day at a time - one meal at a time.  I  didn't excercise yet.  I have 100 hundred reasons why not.  Most of them more like excuses then real reasons.  But I have an appointment to go to curves in the morning to figure out if I want to excercise there.  I'm planning on getting to bed early... I'm sure 8 hours of sleep will help out a lot.  Hopefully I'll feel a bit more positive tomorrow.

      I weighed in at 202.5 today.  I can't stand the thought that I'm over 200 once again.  I swore this wouldn't happen more then once.  why do I constantly let meyself down?  Why is it so hard for me to say "no".  I need to figure out this mentality of mine.  I WILL journal.  I think this is the key to my weight loss.  Figuring out WHY I eat instead of just what and when.  The next step will be to figure out a convientant way of doing it.  Must not fail to plan :)  So far today I had a fried egg and two slices of toast for breakfast.  I ate because I was hungry and felt full and satisfied when I was done.  For my midmorning snack I had a protien bar because I was starting to feel hungry.  I haven't had lunch yet. But I'm not feeling hungry or having any cravings.  It's the cravings that get to me.

       Quote  I am in a good mood. I know not why but alas it remains. The morning is glad to meet my gaze and I to return the favor upon the world.   (My Fiancé)  Last night was cardio night and another HIIT Run for me.  For the first time in a long time, I took my cd player with me.  I always run faster with the tunes in my ear, and Evanescence is a GREAT motivator.  Unfortunately, I think I started out a little too energetic because when it came to my last interval, I was SPENT!  It took everything I had to keep going, and I had nothing left for a sprint at the end.  When I quit, I my stomach, abs, quads, calves, all were cramping.  While walking home, the feeling in my body brought to mind one of George Leonard's "Keys to Mastery" in his Book "Mastery, The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment", Practice.  And not just Practice, but Practice with purpose.  For me the Practice of weight loss and fitness includes eating right, and exercise.  But one of the major changes in my life is that I do both 'with purpose'.  I don't just follow my diet, I stick to it religiously... I've realized that my diet is part of a larger purpose and what I eat EACH day does make a difference and each meal is another step on the path I’ve chosen.  It’s the same with exercise.  It's not enough to move around the track for twenty minutes and say "I've exercised".  I've got to put myself in a situation that's uncomfortable.  I have to push myself beyond my preconceived limits.  Is this paying off?  Do I see results?  Physically I believe I am seeing results, the real challenge will be when those become less obvious.  Will I be able to continue to practice with purpose through the plateaus?  I would like to think so.  Because, for me the results I'm seeing arn't only physical.  The changes on the inside are even greater, and I believe will continue to be so.  So I'll push myself, further and further... and I'll be better for it.

      another great day yesterday - I had a great upper body workout, and the diet is going fine.  I'm finding this to almost be too easy!  (Man I hate saying that)  I'm not obsessing about free days anymore either.  Of course this is the 'up' part of the month, so I'm not going to get too overconfident.  The only down side seems to be that someone has cemented my scale!  I hasn't  moved off of 194 for days!  I've only got a few more days and I really had hoped to get to 192 before the end of the month.  Oh well.  It was just a hope.  This weekend I'm taking my progress pictures and I can't wait to see how I've done.  I haven't desided if I'm going to share them with the challenge group I'm part of or not.  It might be better to wait and let them see the complete transformation, but I AM going to post them on my tracking site.  Should be cool to see the side by side comparisons.    I kinked my neck this week and today I've been in a bit of pain, but I'm going to ignore it and get in another good run.  I don't know if I'll be able to run the entire time again, but I'm still looking forward to the excercise!  This time I'm not going to forget my watch!  The best news of all is that my fiance is taking a greater and greater interest in my workout and finally starting a program of his own.  I know that this will be 10 times easier with him in the same boat.  We are good at encoraging each other to do our best.  I still need to make a plan for when the weather starts to get cooler.  That's always an excuse for me NOT to excercise and I've got to plan NOW not to let that get the best of me!

      I can’t believe how hard I pushed myself last night!  I’m finally feeling like I really can do this, and that it is possible to make a difference in my body.  I’m on fire! Things didn’t start out so well.  I was nearly at the track when I realized that I had left my watch at home.  My fiancé didn’t want to go back so I decided to do my best without it.  I started around the track on my warm up, testing how my body was feeling.  I was still feeling my leg workout but felt strong, so when the time came to start the first interval I went ahead and started at a jog.  Yes! I jogged the entire workout!  I was so excited when I finished.  I even did intervals, doing my best to ramp up every 60 seconds.  When I finished the last 60-seconds I sprinted as hard as I could for as long as I could just to finish myself off.  When I stopped I felt like I was going to puke and I was ecstatic!  I have been on a high ever since.  Dinner turned out great, my fiancé was appreciative of not only the newer sleeker me, but the obvious hard work I’ve been putting into me, AND I managed to throw in some pilates on top of all that.  Score one for the home team, cause I hit a home run yesterday!  On a side note I think I found a protein drink I can stomach.  I’m using pure soy isotope.   I mixed ¼ cup soy with 1 tsp cocoa and 2 packets of splenda, and 1 cup of water.  It made a nice think goopy chocolaty mess that I ate like pudding (thanks for the idea).  Not only did it take the edge of my hunger, but it stamped out any lingering sweet tooth I might have, not that I intend to add desert back into my plans anytime soon.  I just needed something to take the edge off, and I knew I was short on calories yesterday.  I may have to try the same thing with colder water and see if that is even more refreshing.

      Yesterday went really good.  I had a great lower body workout, though I'm thinking of changing it up a bunch starting next week.  I've asked some 'experts' about it.  I've always been impatient quickly jumping from one thing to the next, so I'm letting others deside if it's too soon to revamp my workout.  You see, one of my biggest fears is bulking up my legs.  I've always had 'thunder theighs'  and I have 'calves of steal'  I really don't want to add any muscle to them, I just want to 'trim the fat' .   They are really muscular already, after all they've carried my 200lb body around for years!  And I'm not talking about doing 'the fat lady shuffle'.  I run, walk, pay tennis, bike.  Anyway! :)  I read an article in this month's Muscle and Fitness about paring down a pare shaped body.  I'm not exactly pear shaped (I'm very broad shouldered).  But I do have trouble taking the fat off my lower body.  So, this article talked about doing more reps and lighter weights to increase the calorie burning effect of weightlifting.  It also talked about doing cardio EVERY day.  Though with studying and everything I don't know HOW I would find the time.    I don't want to fall into my old habit of switching programs as soon as some other comes around, but I want to make sure I'm doing the program that works for ME!  Otherwise, I'm looking forward to my cardio tonight.  In the past three weeks I've virtually eliminated the pain in my right foot!  I'm so excited!  I think the strength training had a lot to do with it.  Plus I'm very careful to stretch stretch stretch.    Ate clean yesterday and have been great so far today.

      Wow! I can't believe how long it's been since I posted!  Things are going GRAND!  I'm still seeing amazing progress, and I'm feeling really good today.  I think my hormones have stabalized and I'll have a few weeks of feeling good to look forward to.  Thursday and Friday I really had to fight with myself to excercise, but I did it.  By Saturday though I couldn't fight anymore and I ended up skipping a workout.  This week it's my goal to make every single workout!  My eating has been clean!  maybe too clean.  the fact that I'm feeling so tired toward the end of the week may be a sign I'm eating too little.  I'll have to watch and if it seems this pattern continues, then up my calories each day.  I'm still losing and the Body Fat percentages are going down.  The tape measure is being kind too.  I'm super excited to take my 4 week pictures next week.  I'm positive I'm seeing changes in the mirror, I can't wait to see it on film.    My slacks this morning were feeling like they 'fit' for the first time in a LONG time.  Yet another shot in the arm.  according to my stats I've lost 13 lbs of fat!  It feels fantastic.  I can't wait to see what I can do with the remaining 9 weeks.

      I had a HIIT cardio run last night. I can tell my body is tired and reacting to all this new activity. It was one of those days when it felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and I was running through syrup. It took everything I had to continue to put one foot in front of the other and SLOW! And yet I was totally spent when I finished. I felt horrible and euphric all at the same time. My fiance even mentioned that he could tell I was struggling, and he was proud of me because I didn't quit.   AND I ended up with a workout partner last night. About a year a ago June I discovered running and began a quest to turn myself from a beginner to a runner. I started slow and built up my stanima. I was SO excited the first time I ran 30 minute without stopping! At the same time I talked my fiance into comming with me. He kept telling me "I can't run, I'll just make myself sick..." and other such things. Of course with me beside him he couldn't run very fast, and I was building up by taking breaks, and before he knew it, he too was running 30 minutes without stopping, and soon was outdistencing ME. The bug bit us both and I started training heavily, setting my sites on running a marathon. Then, one day after a 6 mile run I stood up and realized that I couldn't touch either heal to the floor. I had strainded the ligament in the arches of both my feet! I was practically a cripple for a few days and gradually I heeled. But running has been out of the question. And my fiance too gave up running. Now I'm armed with special shoes (I'll have to take a picture of them sometime - they are funny) and inserts, and I'm back on the track. So, last night as I was changing he asked me where I was going. I told him I was going to run and gently asked him if he wanted to come. He said no, that he was too tired. He's been under a lot of stress at work, etc and it really has worn him out. So I just continued to get ready, not put out at all. Before I left though I asked him if he would like to walk to the track with me and at least watch and keep me company. To my surprise he asked me if I would mind waiting for him to change! He joined me and ended up circling the track with me. I guess I'm just really excited that I'm able to set a good example for SOMEONE.   Today I'm planning on working upper body. I'm going to have to get creative to figure out a way to work my back though. So far I haven't been able to really push that part yet. Is it perhaps like legs? Just hard to do? I have surprised trainers on occasion with my back strength. I think it's because I used to be a swimmer.

      I suppose I should have been clearer in a previous post, in that, logically I know weight lifting is good for me. That muscles = fat burning. And that 1 lb of steal takes up a lot less room then 1lb of feathers. But, there are times when this little voice (who sounds an awful lot like my ex) says "You're already too muscular... " and other such things. Just one of those infernal internal battles that one must go through on this journey to fitness.

      I was thinking about weight training last night and trying to figure out why I have such conflicting emotions about it. First of all I have this deep fear of becoming "Monster Woman". For some reason no matter what I read about women not being able to 'bulk up' like a man, I still find myself wanting to lay back on the weights. I think it's this mental image I have of myself of being a 'big girl' For many years I was told my family and my ex that I could "never be 'really' thin" because I was "Big Boned" or "Too muscular" of course the fact that I'm at least 4" taller then my mother, and her 4 sisters... none of whom weighed more then 102lbs the entire time I was growing up didn't help that image. One other thing that came to mind was, though my Dad is a personal trainer himself, I have never once asked him for help. I've always secretly thought he must be embarrassed by me. I think one of the things on my 'to-do' list is to call him and let him know what I'm up to, and get some input from him as well.

      Bleh!  My tummy isn't liking these meds I'm taking!  I'm feeling sicky...  I hope this doesn't keep up.  My brain is rather weird and when my stomach is upset I tend to crav carbs.. BAD carbs more then ever.  I'm doing ok right now, though drinking more soda then I should, but no cravings.  I had my energy bar and that usually calms my sweet tooth.  I just need to make it through the day - and make it through my darn meeting tonight.  They've told us they will be serving 'heavy appitizers' whatever THAT means.  I'm sure it's nothing I want to eat :(.  I only brought lunch, so I'm not sure what I'm going to do.  Maybe I'll just take an extra bar with me to tide me over until I get home tonight.

      195.5!!  Yay! I've finally started loosing weight this week! I ran last night.  What a great experiance.  I wish I had a tape recorder in my head to keep track of all he things that are going on in it while I run.  I kept to the walk 1 minute jog 3 format.  Minute 0 and 1 were an easy warm up, as was minute 2.  minute 3 was the first minute of jogging, and it was pretty easy to get started.  I start out jogging as slow as I possably can.  Practically a walk.  But it's a good warm up.  There was a Soccer team practicing on the field in the middle of the track and I was feeling pretty self contious.  All these lithe quick guys.  I just knew they were watching me and thinking "What in the heck is this fat chick doing? and why is she so slow?"  I kept up this argument with myself saying, "You are NOT the center of the Universe, no one is looking at you."  But it was hard.  About minute 5 Things got really hard.  My shin on my left leg, and the ankle on my right started hurting.  I tried to ignore everything on my body below my waist, and that helped some.  I tried to keep my mind on other things, practiced visulizing my body as I would like it to look.  Long strong and shapely legs that carry me easily.   I managed to keep up the visualizations for most of the rest of my run.  Thinking abut having a nice flat stomach, and strong shapely arms.  The only problem with doing it, is that I would tend to speed up too early, and I would have to remind myself to slow down now and then.  I also imagined peoples reactions when I could flex a decent muscle and/or show off a six pack.  It would be kind of funny to have the guys at work panting... heheheh.  Especially one who's made some 'honest' but hurtfull commments on my figure before.  I probably shouldn't think that way.  What do I care what other people think.  But I do.  I would love to use my fiance's reation as motivation, but he's reactive to my body, no matter what shape I'm in.  NOT that I'm planning to show my body off to anyone else!!  One guy kind of gal here... but, just in the 'girl walking by' kind of way.  It would be fun to have a whole new body for next years company river rafting trip.  Nothing like wearing a bathing suit in front of your coworkers to huble you.  Anyway.  I finished up my run very strong.  Somewhere around 18:30 the nausia started. I knew then that I was doing it right.  I was pushing myself to new limits.  It felt good in a 'sick' kind of way.  And I kept it up all the way to minute 19.  I streatched afterwords, and my foot feels pretty good.  I'm really happy that I've been able to keep this up, and not have a lot of pain.    Eating wise I did good.  We had a GREAT dinner of stuffed chicken breast, and I stayed on plan ALL day.  Today should be a challenge, as I have a meeting for work after hours and won't be able to eat dinner at home.  I know that the food they have at the meeting will be crappy!    I need to drink water!  The meds the Dr gave me say I need to drink Extra water.  I did really lousy yesterday.  I drank about 4 sodas.  And the worse part is I didn't even have any anguish over it.  I just bought them and drank them.  I'll do better today.  Well, I'm off to do my lower body workout.  This should be interesting since I just ran last night!

      Things are still going fantastic!  I feel like I'm doing everything that I need to do.  The results aren't entirely there (still 196), but I know what I'm doing is good for my body, so I'm sticking with it.  Of course that might be more of a struggle when things get harder.  I know there are times when I'll start to think "Why am I killing myself for no results?"   and those will be the times I'll need to get through!  For now, things are fairly easy.  I'm not having any cravings.  I can only attribute THAT to free days.  My workouts are intense, but still fun, and I've not been pressed for time lately so I'm not having problems with those either.  If my evenings were busier it might be harder, because I would have to workout in the morning, and THAT has always been a issue for me.  I've been working on getting up earlier in the mornings, 1 - because I've promised myself to try to get to work on time, and 2 - because I know there are going to be some mornings I have to get up early to excercise.  So far I've managed to get up at 7:30 two days in a row.  I know that sounds bad to some folks, but I'm a REALLY late riser, so for me 7:30 is early.    I hate my 10's on my upper body workout last night.  Everything but the back.  I still need to add more weight for that.  The amazing thing is that I feel like I've really been working hard and yet I'm not really sore the next day, and I seem to recover quickly.  Not that I'm complaining!  Call from my Dr.  I have a bladder infection.  But other then that I'm OK.  My bruise appears to be nothing more then a bruise, which is good news.  I was really worried that I might be low on iron or something like that, but I've call the 'all clear' in that regard.

      It's monday - the start of a new week.  All old ills are forgotten ;)  I actually feel like I had a really good week, even though I only lost 1 lb.  My measurments are down more and my body fat is down, so I'm making progress.  I have to remember not to get all caught up in goals and results and find pleasure in the journey.  Not that I'm not planning to see results!  I had a great Lower Body Workout on Friday and I ran again on Saturday.  My eating has been right on track (if not a little low), and my free day yesterday was in control.  I'm finding I can't eat like I used to and even on my free days I tend not to over do it.  I'm drinking water more and more, and I'm still staying down to 1 or 2 diet sodas a day.  Mentally, I'm feeling a lot better.  Of course the fact that 'aunt flo' came to visit helped.  I'm still taking pleanty of calcium because I don't want to 'crash' like I sometimes do after my period - depression etc.    I've got a menu planned for the week and I'm going to stick to it!  I've got my workouts planned (of course) and I'm going to do all I can to do them all, and to hit my 10's.  I WANT to see progress.  I will practice with purpose!

      I've given up on my "pepsi challenge"  All these changes at once, and added on top of that, the fact that they laid off 7 people at my work, was just too much stress.  I gave in and bought my second diet soda of the day.  I'll give myself a few more weeks and then try to cut back again.  I don't have any soda at home, I didn't buy any at the store, it should be easy to skip it over the weekend.  I visited the dr about the bruise.  He couldn't tell me much and just ordered a bunch of tests.  He didn't tell me that I couldn't continue normal activities, so I'll assume I can.  I plan to do my Lower Body Workout when I get home, and do one cardio on Satuday and make up the one I missed yesterday on Sunday.  I've got pleanty of good food at home for Saturday, and I picked up some fancy cookies for my free day on Sunday.  Looking forward to a GREAT weekend.

      Yesterday was bad.  Bad bad bad.  Here is my list of 'excuses'.  I started on my way home and had trouble, so my fiance and to come get me.  It was 7:00pm by the time I got home and we left right away to go grochery shopping.  So, one good thing there - I did GREAT shopping.  I stuck to my list and got a LOAD of good foods!  BUT, I didn't get home until 9:30!  By then I was STARVING.  So, we threw together a salad, I filled up my bowl, inteding to EAT.  I got about 1/2 way through my bowl and was feeling full, so I stopped.  The bad news is, I only ate a little over 700 calories last night, and after all that I was too tired to workout, I just crashed on the couch and went to sleep.  A totally unproductive day.  I felt so gulty for not working out, but couldn't find the energy!  I WILL make up that missed workout, and I WILL eat better today.  I do feel really good about being prepared for the next two weeks.  Menues are made and food bought, I have NO excuses in that regard.  I'm still strugling to remember to eat.  I'm just not feeling hungry anymore.  I'm drinking water, and I'm skipping the work BBQ.  Nothing there appeals to me.   Fish Fish and more fish.  Doesn't sound good at all.  I wish I could work up a little more enthusiasm.    I'm going to the Dr this afternoon.  I have a bruse that isn't healing.  I suppose I should talk to him about other things too.  I should make a list.  I'm really bad about not wanting to go to the Dr.  Hopefully this one will have time for me.

      All right, I said I would be back, and I am!  It's been a strange day!  I rushed around this morning, focused on getting all set up to drink my six bottles of water and then left forgetting I needed to pack something to EAT!  Duh!  I have no cash with me, so I was sitting here fretting about not having anything to eat but read to drink shakes and energy bars when I remembered that I deliberately only ate 1/2 of my sandwich on Tuesday and the rest was still in the fridge.  So, I had lunch!  So, here are my notes and thoughts on George Leonard's Book called "Mastery, The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment".  For anyone looking at long-term goals it a great book to read.  Basically, here's how I've applied his thoughts to my goal of weight loss and fitness.  Key 1: Instruction  I suppose a great deal of the blame for my failure to achieve "mastery" of my weight loss and fitness goals has been my lack of choosing an Instructor.  Sure, I'll choose one for a while, but it usually doesn't last, and before long, I've moved on to some other method or teacher.  Of course, there is a time and a place to move on, but I know I never have REALLY made a commitment.  I'm not sure if I should decide now, how long to give this (BFL) to work, or wait.  For now, I suppose it's enough that I've committed 12 weeks.  Key 2: Practice  At first, I thought this didn't apply.  But then, I realized, at least in the realm of exercise or fitness, there is a time for practice.  Then it came to me that in diet too there is practice.  It just happens to be on that occurs every day.  Sometimes every minute of every day.  The key is, as they say, "Staying on the Path".  "To practice regularly, even when you seem to be getting no where."  Key 3:  Surrender  This was easy for me to spot as a problem area for me.  Even when choosing a plan, I was constantly making my own modifications to it.  I'm still doing that.  Instead of accepting the teacher’s plan, I choose the parts I like and ignore the rest.  There will be a time and place for that, but, for now, I'll cease to be "Player of all, Master of none"  Key 4: Internationality  Much of this is - practicing with purpose, but also there was a great deal here that has to do with visualization.  Visualization is something I may currently have a problem with.  Sure I can see myself exercising, eating correctly, and even running effortlessly, but I cannot, yet, visualize myself as thin toned, and in shape.   I'm not even sure how to start.  I can't remember ever feeling proud of my body, so I don't even have memories to go on.  I'll continue to visualize what I can, and maybe the rest will come to me.  It's something to research at the very least.  Key 5:  The Edge  I'm not even close to looking over the edge... It may be years before I am... and I'm happy that way, for now.  There was so much more to this book that was both useful and insightful.  Perhaps tomorrow I'll put in my notes about resistance to change.  On a less mental note :)  I'm still at 196.  Feeling mentally like PMS is starting it's strangle hold on my emotions and will power.  I WILL work through this.  I  WILL not let these dark thoughts keep me from achieving my goals, and if I slip, I'll get back on the path and continue my journey.

      Yesterday was a good day.  I did my pilates last night, and again it was hard!!  I finished reading the book on mastery, and I'm working to put those practices into action, and apply them to my life.  I think it's PMS time :( and I'm fighting it with calcium to see if I can beat this.  I'm feeling tired and emotioinally wrung out.  Will post more later.

      Ok, so I'm a posting fool today.  I just feel the need to get stuff out right now, I guess.  So, its almost 4:30 and I just opened my first pepsi!  Now, granted a bought a 1 litre bottle, but still I went most of the day without it.  I was getting a mild headache so I figured I better get one before it turned into a NASTY headache.  I've also desided to set aside 6 water bottles so that I can make sure I get my 90oz of water in.  Baby steps, baby steps.  Maybe after I feel comfortable while staying around 1500 calories a day, I can start working on making my meals more nutrisious.  I know I should be eating more fruits and veggies!  Hmm.. maybe I should start now on a grochery list for next week.  It can't hurt to plan, now can it?    I looked at my 'before' pictures again today.  They look so sad!  I want to put them someplace where I can see them all the time to remind me to 'be good' but I dont want to subject others to the view.  I'll have to think about what to do there.

      I got my package for the BFL challenge!!  I'm actually pretty excited about it.  Funny though, I get more fire from the Bikini Babe challenge.  Maybe because it seems as if I'm competing against real people, not some unknown faceless crowd.  While I was walking to the mailbox I thought of one other reason for doing what I'm doing.  I want to be able to walk in shorts and NOT have them crawl up my inner thighs!  Why is it, that never seems to happen to the skinny chicks?  *sigh*  Yet another goal to add to my list!

      I ran last night! and it felt so good!!  It was like meeting up with and old friend.  I really felt like I had worked out at the end of 20 minutes.  The time just flew by.  My foot hurt a little, but I stretched REALLY good, and took something to keep the inflamation down, and this morning woke up feeling fine!  I did good food wise yesterday, though I think I might have to up my calories a bit.  They are getting scarily low.  I know I need to find more ways to get in my protien.  I drank my water about 90 oz or so and I've serisouly limited my cafiene intake.  I know it's good for me.  I'm still waiting to feel it though.  My pilates last night was HARD!  The hardest it's ever been.  I can feel all the work I've been doing on my abs and they are protesting.  I was way out of form last night but finished my practice as best I could.  Hopefully it will be better tonight.  I did my upper body workout this morning as I have rehersal tonight.  It was HARD.  The second week of workout out usually is.  But I was so tired!  Again, I think upping my protien intake might help that some.  But I have to realize that this is all new stuff for my body,and it's going to take some time for it to get used to all this excercise.  As usual I'm impatient, but I'm reading a book on mastery that talks a lot about enjoying the journey and not just the destination.  I'm working on that.  I was thinking today while I was working out - "Why am I doing this?"  I know I want to loose weight. That's a given, but what else do I want out of it, so I started making a list.  I want a sexy back, strong firm arms, a flat tummy, a butt that ends were it's supposted to and not high on my back, I want to run a 5K.  I want to finally feel like I succeeded.

      I bought a book yesterday.  Of course that's nothing new for me.  I love to read and study, and if weight could be lost by knowledge alone, I would have been at my goal YEARS ago.  Still, I find each book I read has at least one point that worth it.  This one brings up the idea of UFO's Unidentified Fitness Obstacles.   Things that could be keeping you from getting and staying in shape.  I took the test and found the results really interesting.  Some, I read through and discarded.  But there were others that really made me THINK about my actions.  One was "Perfectionism"  I am terrible for that.  When I go on a plan it's ALL OUT, and when I fall off.. I'm ALL the way off.  I've got to learn to take small steps and strive for progress.  Another item was what they called "Askaphobia" or the Fear of asking for help.  I'm rather bad about this, and even when I join support groups, I tend to fall into the habit of being the person offering help instead of asking.  I even find that I resent help when it's offered because of my "I'll do it' myself" attitude.  I'm working hard on breaking that habit.  I know I need diet buddys.  People who will support and hold me accountable.  The last issue that really caught my eye was "Quickfixia Nervosa" , or Erratic Diet History.  This is me in a nutshell.  I've barely started one program when I'll read about something else to do or try, and skip on to it.  I want so badly for this all to happen quickly and easily.  I HAVE to convince myself that I'm in it for the LONG HAUL.    On a less mental note...  I did great food wise yesterday, and stayed under 1400 calories.  It's almost getting scary how easy it is.  Today after two meals I'm feeling really bloated.  I think I need to go for a smaller breakfast, and make sure I don't eat until I begin to feel hunger to avoid this in the future.  I did a lower body workout yesterday and felt GREAT about it.  I have read some 'tips' in my new book about what it means to work a muscle to failure, and I'm going to put them to use on my next workout.  I feel as if I could and SHOULD be doing more.  I desided not to do pilates yesterday because I really worked my abs during my workout, and I knew I wouldn't be able to be in control for pilates.  I think I'll skip pilates on Lower Body Workout days, or only do breathing excercises those days to avoid overtraining or hurting myself.    Engery wise, I'm feeling GREAT.  I know that TTOTM (sorry any men out there) is coming soon and I'll be battling fatigue, cravings and weight gain, but I know if I can make it through the first month of that.. I'll be able to battle in on successive months.  Funny that PMS is one of the top UFO's for women...  Today I'm going to do some Tae Bo when I get home - and some pilates in the evening.  OH and I have no more pepsi at home and I don't plan to buy any more, SO I'm only drinking water at home.  That's made it much easier to get my water in.  I'm still drinking soda at work, but I'm bringing a 33 oz bottle of water to work and I'm making myself finish it before I'll allow myself a soda.  I'm working on breaking this addiction!

      I am so pleased with how the weekend went - and how the week went in general.  Yesterday was my free day, and I did go wild, but not as wild as I could have.  After logging all my food, it looks as though I still stayed under 2500 calories, and with the bike ride and other excercise I may have still not exceeded the number of calories I burned.  I can't believe how positive I'm feeling.  I took measurements today and they are ALL down!  I used them to update my scale and now the body fat percentage is finally going down too.  I can definatly feel the difference in my clothes as well.  I can say for certain that having that free day certainly made a difference in my will power too.  I feel ready to face the week.    I want to make sure I get all my workouts in this week.  Like this week, if I miss one day, I'm going to make it up the next.  It may not be the optimal way of doing it, but it has to be better then not doing it at all.  I also want to work on drinking more water and less soda.  I love (diet) soda, and many times I think it saves me from my sweet tooth, but I'm tired of the addiction.  I'm tired of always having to make sure I've got a soda around, or face the HEADACHE.  I'm going to taper off slowly.  I doubt I'll cut it out completely, because it is one of my daily pleasures, but I want it to be a pleasure not a nessecity.  I'm not planning to change anything with my food plan.  I may try to find a multi-vitamine that has iron in it, and add some brussle sprouts or broccoli into my diet, but otherwise I'm happy with the results.  I'm planning on continuing to journal ALL my food, because that has helped SO much.  I just need to keep my determination and focus on al the positive things that are happening.  I'm going to keep bulding one week on the next until I've finally got the body I want.  Maybe one day I WILL be able to visualize a lean and strong me.

      yesterday ended well.  I didn't get my upper body workout in.  I was feeling guilty later for not getting in a workout, so I did a session of pilates.  I felt SO much better after that, and I'm actually getting much better at it.  I did make one discovery last night.  I was laying in bed and was thinking over my week and how well I seemed to be doing.  I starting thinking about what it will be like when I get closer to goal, and tried imagining how my body would look.  I realized, I couldn't.  I have no idea what I would look like, toned and thin!  I'm going to have to work on that, that's for sure.  Today I did my upper body workout to make up for yesterday and it went really well.  Then we walked a LOT at the Ren faire.  I've been doing GREAT food wise, and even managed to pass up cheesecake.  I picked up some sugared almonds (some of my favorites) for my free day tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to a really nice, relaxing day.  Though I think we're going to go for a bike ride, so I'll get my last cardio in for this week.

      Things are going GREAT GREAT GREAT!!  I've been dillengent about taking my vitamins, and now I'm looking for holes in my nutrition.  It looks as though I'm low on Vitamin K and Iron.  Which is interesting because I bruse very easily, and I'm always fighting being tired, so it's possable that the lack of those two vitamins could be causing some anemia.  So, I need to up my Dark green veggies.  Perhaps some brussle sprouts every day.    So, I don't even know where to start - I did great on my intake yesterday.  perhaps a little too low (just under 1300) but I managed to not feel ravinous all day!  I think the water helped a lot, and I plan to keep drinking today.  I did my cardio when I got home from work.  And it was hard!  maybe a bit too hard, so I may wait to do that tape again, until I lost a bit more.  It's too hard on my knees.  Mentally, I'm feeling stronger every day.  I'm starting to feel the changes my body is making and that's all I need to keep on keeping on.  keeping to my plan through the two rough days Tuesday and Wednesday really did a lot to boost my moral.    I haven't said a lot to my fiance about my new program, mostly because he tends to be a little 'over' supportive.  He starts telling me he can see a difference even when he can't.  BUT he has noticed my increase in excercise and last night while I was doing cardio, went out to use the total gym.  I would love for him to want to tone up, but I'm not going to say anything.  It has to be his decision.    I'm looking forward to the weekend.  this will be the REAL test.  To not let the weekend get the best of me.

      The fat fairy must have visted me last night because this morning I woke up and the scale was down 2 lbs!!  Ok, so I know people are starting to grumble about me wieghing everyday, so I think I'll explain.  I weigh daily, or at least try to.  I record those weights and then at the end of the week, I average them for my 'official' weigh in.  What I look for is that the average weight goes down.  After all, as any woman can tell you, a simple change in hormons can cause an overnight gain of 5 or 6 lbs sometimes.  My way of weighing in tends to negate those water gains, and I think keeps me more mentally stable.  Last week my average (and I missed weighing in two days) was 199.9.  This week my average so far - 199.9! And I'm feeling good about that.  Add the fact that I'm feeling good today, and I've got a much better mental outlook.  Here is what I've noticed so far:   I'm starting to feel more energetic in the mornings, and I'm hoping that eventually I'll be able to get up early and do my workouts then.  Yesterday the shorts I wore (wich were just slightly too big before) were fairly hanging off me.  I think I could have pulled them off without unbuttoning them.  The slacks I put on this morning feel a LOT more comfortable, and I don't have the roll at the top of them showing against my blouse.  I'm standing taller (thank the pilates) My ring fits better.  AND, I cheeted and took my waist measurement (where I see losses first) and it's about 1 - 1.5 inches smaller!! yay!  I'm going to have to remember all these postives when the going gets tough!  I've also figured out that I need to drink more water.  I think that has a lot to do with the overwelming hunger I've been feeling, and the shakeyness.  I've really tried to focus on my workout this week, but I may have to shift focus just a little to the water so that I feel better.    Other parts of my life seem to be benefiting from all this work as well.  I'm finding it easier to keep up with the housework with the extra energy I have.  This morning I was able to make sure everything was picked up and neat before I left, and it's a great relief to know it will look like that when I get home.  That way I can do my workout as soon as I hit the door.

      I dropped off my car and walked back home.  Two miles in 35 minutes and I feel GREAT!!  I can't believe how good that felt.  Just that chance to stretch my legs and not be worried about HOW I was doing it was really refreshing.  for the past two days, whenever I've excercised it was with control.  Weightlifting, kickboxing, and pilates are all about form.  whereas  when I walk I just do it.  I don't have to think, I breath, my legs move, my arms swing, and I can enjoy everything that's going on around me.  I really need to do that more often!

      Still no car, and I'm stuck home again.  I ate 1400+ calories yesterday, but felt hungry all evening.  I don't like that! I woke up this morning feeling ravinous, shaky and queezy!  It was awful.  I quickly ate some breakfast (scrambled eggs wrapped in a tortilla) and have been feeling better all morning.  I think someone super glued my scale though!  I stepped on this morning and it's still exactly 200lbs.  I usually do find, that's what happens the second week into a diet.  My water weight finally finds a set point.  Now I just have to wait for the 'fat flush'  I've been working out really hard.  And I know that I'm going to build some muscle.  I just don't want to get discouraged.  I so want to see a change.  I want to know that what I'm doing is making a difference.  I simply have NO patients.  I'm going to have to work on that I suppose.  I was running about 185, this time last year, and it took me 12 months to get up to 200.  So, I guess I shouldn't be too upset that it's going to take a few months to take it off again.  It's just hard.  I just find that I need to give myself these mental 'pep talks' way too often.  I'm going to stay focused! I AM!

      My car broke down, and I didn't go to work today.  That was good because I had the time to do my cardio.  It felt so good!  I actually managed to keep up with most of it.  I'll keep doing the beginning kickboxing tape until it doesn't feel like a 10 anymore, then I can work up to the more advanced one.  One problem with being home, is that I'm getting bored, and that makes me want to snack.  I've worked really hard and keeping myself busy.  Finding people to talk to, etc.  One good thing that's come from my being diligent about my journalling is that, at least today, It's kept me from eating mindlessly.  I keep thinking about snacking on some nuts, but then I think about the fact that I would have to measure it, and then record it, and it becomes too much trouble.  So I haven't.  One victory for me!!

      I had a GREAT day yesterday.  This week started the addition of excercise to my schedule, and, as always, it's made a huge difference already in how I feel.  I got home last night, tired and ready for nap, and instead I got out my Total Gym and did an upperbody workout.  I'm still getting the feel of my limits, but it felt GREAT to get the blood pumping.  I don't think I overdid it too much as I'm not over sore, except in a few odd places, like the sides of my elbows.  Who knew I had muscles there?  I also started practicing pilates.  Wow! what a workout.  I couldn't believe how week my 'core' muscles were.  I'm sore from that too, but it's a good kind of sore.  I'm planning to practicing again tonight.    I did great eating yesterday too.  I didn't really have any cravings and I did really well on calories.  I also did much better with drinking my water, so I feel that over all it was a fantastic day.  I'm feeling thinner and my pants feel looser.  I'm going to try to restrain myself and NOT take my measurements just yet!  But it's hard when I so long for results.. immediatly.

      Well, it's monday - 1 week down!  Today I 'officially' started the Bikini babe's challenge and I'm also 'officially' starting the BFL challenge.  I had a rough weekend.  With moving I didn't find the time or energy to eat as I should and last night when we took our moving helpers out to dinner, I threw all the rules out the window and ate everything I wanted.  Therefore I knew weigh-in today would be BAD.  And it was.  Back up to 201.5, but that's still 1 lb less then last week, so postive steps have been taken.  The other good note is that I lifted and toated a LOT of stuff this weekend, some of it quite heavy, and I'm not as sore as I was two weeks ago when I helped someone else move.  So, I'm taking that to mean that I'm in better shape!    I haven't done my workout yet today.  I'm planning to do that when I get home.  The 'total gym' is set up and ready to go, so all I have to do is go home and change.  For my cardio workout, this week, I'm going to try rotaiting between the different workout tapes I have at home.  I have by kickboxing tape and bellydancing tapes that should at least be a start.  Hopefully as my weight goes down I can work into running again, but I'm willing to be patient.  I also bought a new lunch box this morning.  That way I can pack my lunch and snacks so I'll not be tempted to 'fast food' it while at work.  I'm set and ready to go!!

      Yesterday was another coup... Had a gread nutrition day. I'll have you all know that I've already burned through one blender. My wonderful loving fiance stopped by the store yesterday at lunch and picked up a new one. He then rushed home so he could fix me a shake and have it ready for me when I got home. I think he just wanted to be the first to try it out. It's got HORSEPOWER.  Today I'm working toward 1450...  Someone pointed out that I was doing my BFL pyramids wrong and I wasn't going heavy enough of my 5th set...Thanks to them I SMOKED my upper body workout!! AND, I WAY upped my weight on my shoulder presses.. not really sure why I thought I could push it that far (everyone's always told me girls don't have strong shoulders) but I pushed it anyway and was PROUD of it. My ultimate goal is to one day being able to do headstand pushups.. even if I have to lean against the wall to do them.  I'm starting to wonder if there will ever be a day when something on my body isn't aching! Perhaps I'll know I'm not pushing hard enough when that happens.  I have a HIIT run planned for the day.. looks like a beautiful day for it.. hope the weather continues to last!

      Weekend was good and my weight is FINALLY down to 188.5! measurements are finally down too.  I never got to make up my leg workout... time got away from me, and I thought I might make it up Sunday evening after dropping off my daughter, but, I was running late, and then when I got to the drop off point, and called my ex to tell him I was there, he informes me that HE won't be there for another 30-45 minutes... I didn't get home until after 10:00 and I was beat. But I did get 2 cardio workout's in... woo hoo!  I did get some information this weekend that I'm not sure how to handle. While shopping this weekend I happened to double check the nutritional information for the soy protien I'm using... Seems the info I was using was WRONG. What does this mean? Well let me give you a 'for instance': On Friday I thought my intake was this:  Total: 1292 Fat: 15 132 10% Sat: 3 25 2% Poly: 4 38 3% Mono: 4 39 3% Carbs: 134 453 35% Fiber: 21 0 0% Protein: 175 701 55% Alcohol: 0 0 0%  when it actually was this:  Calories Eaten Today source grams cals %total Total: 1443 Fat: 15 132 9% Sat: 3 25 2% Poly: 4 38 3% Mono: 4 39 3% Carbs: 134 453 32% Fiber: 21 0 0% Protein: 206 824 58% Alcohol: 0 0 0%  So in truth, I've been eating about 150 more calores a day....   Sunday's run was GREAT! By getting a baseline on the 'laps' I was able to do, I gave myself a goal to reach for. Make it much more interesting while traveling around the track. I've discovered there's a pattern to my HIIT runs. The first Interval is the Hardest. the hardest to start, the hardest to complete, the hardest to push myself. The easiest is the second.. with the dificulty going up from there. I just find it interesting, that for me, the hardest part is the begining. I'm pretty much the same with my weight training, once I START I'm good, but it's getting past the 'I should change my clothes' point and getting to the 'lifting the first weight' phase. I'm looking for ways to change my attitude about all this because I think it will make a huge impact in my progress overall. Oh, and I increased my laps from 5.5 to 5.75! One day I'll have to take my fiance's watch out with me one day and see what my average pace is.

      My ankles were bothering me yesterday, (in fact they were still bothering me when I woke up this morning) SO I held out on my Lower body workout. It WILL be made up before monday. I want to be able to give my workout 100% and I won't be able to if I'm worried about my feet. If there was one bit of fitness advice that I could give EVERYONE it would be.. .if you are going to do road running get "Better then Good" running shoes fitted by a professional. I would not wish planter fasciitis on ANYONE!  And my weight stayed at 189.5 amazingly enough. I may have reached my goal of

      I had really set myself up for a challenge yesterday with my plan to do my cadio and make up my upper body in one day. But I did it! Last night was probably one of my best cardio ever! My 6's were really 6's and my 9's were 9's. I really focused on form, on how I was feeling, on were I was on the track at ay given time. My 10 was even a SURE 10 because there wasn't anything left in the tank to sprint with at the end! I also noticed that I'm recovering quicker during my active recovery time. It's a lot of work to keep the mind busy while running around a track but I think I did a good job of it last night. I also counted laps, and I'm 'running' a little over 1.25 miles in 17 minutes. Not the best, but then I never was a FAST runner. I'm going to see if I can improve that over the next few weeks.  I did arms much later. I could tell the energy levels were a little low but I still felt I had a great workout. I think I figured out why I like upper body day though. It's the pushups. At the end of every workout I've been seeing how many pushups I can do. And every time, I do more then the last. I don't know what is it with me that makes me feel like EVERY day has to be a personal best. That's the mentality that had me dropping down to 700 calories per day! eep! I'll just have to watch myself and make sure this drive I have during my workouts doesn't turn into something negative. After all that's what most negative traits are anyway.. just positive traits pushed too far. But, back to my workout...  I tried upright rows again for the first time probably in a month. They still KILL my shoulder. Right in the front at the joint. It's my left shouder and I'm right handed, so other then sleeping wrong, I don't know what I could have done to it. I was hoping that by doing other shoulder excercises I could strengthen this area and the pain would go away, but no go :(  I did manage two, yes TWO full pushups! YAY!  Eating was clean yesterday. There was a moment of tempation when a bunch of the guys from work asked me to go to lunch with them, and then didn't want to take not for an answer (I'm rarely invited to lunch with the 'guys' so it was hard to say no) But I held strong, and stayed at the office and ate my salad.  The best news of all? I stepped on the scale this morning (Giving it up after Monday) and I was down to.... 189.5! I'm almost afraid to be happy as I might wake up tomorrow and it will be gone. Still, it's good to know my body is on the move again. I just have to hang in there.  One last thing I've realized: I think the hardest thing for me has been the loss of 'fast food'. The ability to have a busy night and then reach over to the phone and say "Hello Dominos?" I feel I've lost some of the spontinaity in my life. Meals (especially dinner) have to be planned, chicken taken out of the freezer the night before.. etc. I think that's one of the reasons I was craving PB&J the other day... it was simple, and nothing to do with food is simple anymore.

      I'm feeling better. Perhaps not 100% but not what I would describe as 'bad'. I wore one of my favorite suits to work today. Once I haven't fit into since December... I'm feeling rather 'spiffy'. Nothing like a 'Short Skit and an LONG Jacket' to make a girl feel sexy. *grin*  I'm looking forward to my Upper body workout tonight. UBWO night is my favorite. I think because I love bicep curls. I like being able to watch the muscles work. Perhaps I need to get a mirror, I'm becoming rather narcisistic!  Couple of things I was thinking about this morning... (Yes I'm a rather intraspective person)  Does it ever get easier? Is there ever a time when you don't have to track every morsel food? Is there a moment in time when this becomes ingrained, and not something you have to think about constantly?  The other thing I've realized is that I need to get off the scale. I'm so stinking adicted to the thing. So, I'm going to finish off this week.. weigh in Monday, and then not weigh in again until October 27th. That will be the end of my First "official" BFL challenge and 8 weeks into the Body blast. After that, I won't weigh in again until the end of the challenge. I'll only be guaging my progress by clean eats, and workout effort. Things I can control! (My goodness what will I have to obsess over now!?)

      It's late, and I can't sleep - AGAIN  I've felt crappy all day - stayed in bed until 3:30pm today...probably why I'm not a bit sleepy now. I made a decision early in the morning to postpone my UBWO. I was just feeling so ragged. Not sure if it's my alergies (The mildest case I've had in two years) or a bit of the flue that's been going around, but to be safe I thought I would rest up. Amazingly enough after getting a LOT of rest today I've been practically bouncing off the walls this evening. Guess all this exercise is paying off. I DID fit a SMALL PG&J into my plan today... and I still managed to come in GREEN! :) Yes, jelly isn't the best choice ever, but I had a VERY small amount, with 1 Tbs of Peanut better on 1 slice of bread. And the totals for the day...  I've been trying for 45% Protien/45%Carb/10%Fat so I don't think I'm doing too bad... Since I've had a couple days in the 1300 range I think I'll shoot for the lower (1250) range of calories for the next two days.  I'm just hoping for this blue funk I've been in to go AWAY. It's probably hormonal... Though it could be my body's homeostasis kicking in. I've just got to convince it that I'm serious! The good news is that I haven't burried all these feelings in a bowl of ice cream. I'm doing my best to acknowledge them to feel them fully. To take them out and look them over and learn more about them, and myself... the good, the bad... perhaps one day, I'll be better able to detach myself from them... Mitch Albom explained it this way in his book "Tuesdays with Morrie" ..  "Take any emotion -- love for a woman, or grief for a loved one, or what I'm going through, fear and pain from a deadly illness. If you hold back on the emotioins -- if you don't allow yourself to go all the way through them -- you can never get to being detached, you're too busy being afraid. you're afraid of the pain, you're afraid of the grief. You're afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails. "But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowingyourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even, you experience them fully and completely. You know what pain is. you know what love is. You know what grief is. And only then can you say, 'All right. I have experienced that emotion. I recognize that emotion. now I need to detach from that emotion for a moment'"  I'm finding I'm spending a lot of time 'over my head' lately. But, perhaps, that's a good thing.

      In other news... I'm sitting here craving a PB&J Sandwich and wondering if I can fit it in and still be green.... hmmm  I think it's time to start digging through the cookbooks and shaking up the menu a bit. Last night I made "extra lean ground turkey" soft tacos. It was a nice break from chicken. Since lately I've been having chicken for both dinner AND Lunch I can see why I'm starting to become less then thrilled when it comes time to eat. Must remidy that as I don't want to get back into the habit of skipping meals. There is no reason why we can't be healthy AND enjoy our meals. Is there? Since cooking is a hobby of mine I'll have to see what I can do to make things interesting in the upcomeing weeks.

      Yesterday's workout was so strange. I got a little snippy with my family after getting my feelings hurt and I was still feeling that way as I set off toward the track. When I got to the stoplight at the corner I had such a stronge urge just to run... in ANY direction. I wanted to see new things, go new places and just get AWAY. But I knew there was not way my feet would survive pounding on the sidewalk so I just continued on to the track. When I got there the 'normal' crowd was there. No scrimage game, thank goodness. I don't think I would have been strong enough to do that two workouts in a row! I started running, but I was completely unenthusicastic. I felt so tired. Not physically but spirtually. I kept plodding along. Upping the tempo at each interval, continuing to go through the motions even though my heart wasn't in it. But, amazingly enough, as I pushed my body, my mind seemed to follow. Each interval lifted my heart just a little more, until by the last one I was feeling GREAT and I did a 100 yard sprint to finish it off. I headed back hope in MUCH better spirits and appoligized to them immediatly, then explained what had bothered me. They accepted it all... and peace rigned in our household once more. All because I went for a run. :)  I've really been working on my food intake. Upping portion sizes a little and making sure to eat all 6 meals. Last night after figuring my intake for the day I discovered I had room for 4oz of turkey instead of 3, and 2 low car tortillas instead of 1.. AND a sprinkle of Fat free cheese! (Don't worry, I also had a nice crisp salad with my meal)  Unfortunaly my body hasn't started reacting to the additional calories well. Oh I feel ok. Energy levels are good, but my weight continues to climg UP. I woke up feeling sick and bloated again. The scale rolled around to a very unlovely 193.5. I had about 3 litres of water yesterday, so I don't know WHAT is going on. I just need to stick with it, I know. Consitancy.. consitancy. Almost impossable to imagine loosing 10 inches off my waist.. but I could! I can! I will!

      I got home last night and realized that I HAD to work on the house. Things had really slid over the lazy weekend. So, my fiancé and I toddled over to Laundromat and washed clothes in 95+ degree weather! Sheesh, that was my sauna treatment for the week. We finally finished after 9:00pm. All I had managed to eat was a quick bocca burger before we left. So, we went home and did up the dishes, and straightened up a bit. I was finally feeling HUMAN, and the temperature had dropped to reasonable levels. I knew I needed to eat, but I didn’t want anything heavy because I still had to workout, so I sliced up an apple and rolled it in protein powder. I ate a few pieces right away, and then nibbled on the rest while I was working out. It worked out rather well, rather like a homemade power drink. By this time it was after 10:00pm. Being diligent I drug out my weights and started my lower body workout. My first set of squats almost had me screaming. Either I was still sore from last week’s lower body workout, or I had worked harder on my bike ride then I thought... or both! I wasn’t sure I would be able to do my workout it hurt so bad. But after a short rest I tried again, and the second set was easier… I guess I just needed to warm up and stretch things out a bit.  I was a little worried about my feet after the Reverse lunges. I was setting the ball of my foot and then pressing down the heal of my foot, and it was stretching the arch of my foot. I hurt after words and with the issues I’ve had with my feet, it was worth stressing about, but I woke up this morning and my feet are GREAT… Whew!  I think I’m going to have to switch to single calf raises. I’m just not feeling these the way I think I should. I remember once at the gym on the standing calf raise machine I wasn’t thinking clearly and I did a set of 12 reps at 130lbs… Of course I couldn’t WALK the next day, but I think that makes it pretty clear that I could stand to raise the weight on my calf raises a bit.  I finished my workout sometime after 11:00pm and I STILL hadn’t had a ‘real’ dinner. I was pretty sure I was low on calories, but not certain and to my horror, when I went to verify fitday.com was down!! So just to be sure I fixed myself a huge bowl of veggies and some chicken and ate up. Needless to say going to bed on that full of a stomach did NOT feel good, but I felt good about getting the calories in non the less.  I was getting a little bummed about being at 192 STILL. I’ve been working on this same two pounds for over four now. I realize this isn’t HORRIBLE, but it makes my goal of 130 seem SO far away. If I think about it long enough I really start to get frustrated and discouraged, so I’ve found more and more I’m having to focus on things outside the scale. Things like how much better my clothes are fitting, how GREAT I feel, physically and mentally, how positive it is to be honoring self promises… and things of that nature. This is such a mental shift for me. I WILL reach my goals. In the meanwhile, I’m doing something good for myself, and that makes it worth it.  So far today things are going well. I woke up feeling gross and bloated, probably from eating so late. My hands had swollen up so much in the night that I ended up having to take off my ring. I was surprised to be as low as 192. I had to be to work for an early meeting and didn't really feel like eating so I chopped up an apple and mixed it with protien powder. It was enough for the moment. I grabbed an energy bar for my meeting because I knew it was going to go through 12:00pm and I figured it was best to be prepared. I've had chicken and greens for lunch so things seem to be going great. Suprising, after having wobbly legs all night last night after my workout, and moaning and groaning each time I had to get up or down out of a chair, I'm not that sore today. Guess I'm getting better at recovery... Looking forward to my HIIT run tonight. Hopefully it's cooler then last night.

      What a fantastic weekend!  Friday night I went to a ball game and sat in a luxury box free from my work.  Had a real good time with the guys from work, had a 'free meal' and no beer.  The no beer had been one of my goals so I was thrilled that I had stood strong.  Saturday I ate clean, got a LOT of excercise and then my fiance' took me out for a night on the town.  I pulled out this dress that I had bought about 6 months ago.  When I bought it I brought it home and showed it to my fiance' and in his loving, honest way he said.  "Oh honey, that dress isn't very flattering".  The funny thing is.. I KNEW it wasn't flattering and I wasn't upset in the least to hear him say it.  So, that's the dress I pulled out Saturday, I dressed in secret and then came out and 'suprised' him.  I was thrilled to have him confirm that this black, slinky dress was now the picture of 'flattering'.  We had a GREAT evening, went out to eat where I stayed in complete control, went to a bar where I got to sing, and where I sipped diet colas all evening.  I went home still energetic, and still aglow.  My fiance' let me know "You looked GREAT tonight"  a compliment he doesn't give out often or friveralously.  He's always quick to say "You're beautiful"  but 'spot compliments' don't come often.  Sunday was a day of sleeping in, a terrific bike ride and an awsome upper body workout.  We had stopped at Play it Again Sports and I bought 20 lbs (4x5) of plates for my dumbbells so I was able to up my workout a knotch.  I actually did 1 - full body pushup - 1/10th of the way toward my goal...  And my weight is down to 191.5 Body Fat percentage 42.8.  I'm making progress slowly but surely, and loving every step of the journey.

      I called and talked to my Dad for the first time since I started this journey.  I guess for most folks that doesn't seem like a big deal, but you see... my Dad's a personal trainer.  In hollywood of all places.  He has been since I was 13.  Talk about an image to live up too!  I didn't live with him, but I've always wondered how different I would be if I had.  He's now 55 years old, 6'2", 225lbs and still training.  I've never talked to him much about my weight issues or anything like that, but he's been on my mind lately, and I called him and 'confessed'.  *grin*  He was SO excited.  And then, I think, surprised by the amount of knowledge I already have.  He started giving me advice right away... including "Read Protien Power Don't study it, just read it, Don't do that Adkins Crap"... I told him my current plan and he was actually pretty happy with it.  Not that I was calling to be critiqued, but just to get his support.  Just another person I can count on to be 100% in my corner.   He had all kinds of other great advice like "Don't worry about the number on the scale.  You just have to get up in the morning and be happy with the body you see in the mirror."  "You'll never be a stick figure, and you shouldn't want to be, be glad you have curves, and make the best of them.  Look at Madona, no matter how much she trains she'll never have a butt, you've already got one, all you have to do is tone it down a bit"  "You look just like your grandma Mueller, She was a beutiful woman, and you are a beautiful woman, she had curves, you have curves"  lol Arn't Dads great?  I've thought about sending him the link to the blog and such, but I'm not sure I'm ready to be THAT exposed.    Anyway, just another step toward surrounding myself with people who believe in me.   :)

      Yesterday was the hardest workout I ever had to do. And not just because my legs were still screeming from the workout the day before! My first obstical was our plans to go into the city last night to visit my future sister-in-law. The old me would have just put off the workout to keep everyone happy, but the new me said "I need to run first". The best part of that was that no one minded! So, I mixed up a quick shake, gulped it down and went out for my run. Now, understand that my legs hurt so bad it's hard to get in and out of chairs, so while walking to the track I was doing my best to warm them up and get them loosened up. The I got to the track and my heart sank. Not only was my Soccer team there, but a second team AND a bevy of fans! It was a scrimage game. I wanted to turn and run home. The little voices in my head started in... "They'll laugh at you" one said "Don't subject them to your fat butt jiggling around the track, don't subject them to that" another said "You'll bother the players running behind the goals" said the next. I truely felt like crying right then and there as it had taken so much just to get that far! But, I didn't turn around. I stepped onto that track and began my workout. Every lap was harder then the next. I knew every 1/2 heard comment or murmer of laughter was about me. Then somehow, it got easier. Maybe it was one of the soccer players troting around the track with an older woman (probably his mother) struggling to keep up. Or the group of children that started following me, laughing, skipping, holding hands, and sometimes racing to catch up with me before falling back with the group. Maybe it was the smiles and nods of enchoragement I got from the few people I dared to make eye contact with. Or maybe it was just that feeling deep inside that I was doing something RIGHT. I was doing what I needed to do, despite the ache in my legs, despite what others might say, think or do... I was doing something for ME!  Well, except for having to be helped in and out of the car the rest of the night, it went really good. We went to one of my favorite itallian resteraunts and I bypassed the alfredo and ordered thier 'Healthy Chicken'. Then I picked all the chicken and veggies off the plate and left the pasta behind. Had some NUMMY grilled asparagus, though I had to shake off the cheese. Still, considering where I was, I ate well. I got grumbled at by my fiance and his sister for not eating much, but then I rattled off to them everything else I had eaten that day and they settled down a bit. I guess if you only eat three meals a day what I eat at a meal does look REALLY small... but in the context of 6 meals it's pretty resonable. At least _I_ think it is :) I'm still struggling with what to do tonight. My company has invited me to thier luxury box at the A's game. I really don't like baseball, so the lure they are using is 'open bar and free food'. The only way I could enjoy that is to take a free day, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for that mentally.

      I took a 20 minute walk at lunch to try and work through the stiffness in my legs and glutes.  Then I started thinking.  I realized that this attitude of mine has totally hamstrung me.  Not just in my fitness goals, but in my whole life.  I hate to fail.  And rather then put my whole self into something I go half-a$$ed.  Therefore, if things don't go as planned it's not like I really failed.  After all I really didn't try.  This has held me back in so many ways!  In just a few weeks I'm taking a test that could completly change my career for the better.  I've been dinking around for months now.  Not putting everything into my studies, not using all the resources avaliable to me to make sure I'm completely prepared.  And why?  Maybe I'm lazy.  or maybe, as I said before... if I take the test, and don't pass. It won't be a 'failure'.  I think the same thing has happened with the business my fiance' and I have 'started'.  I quote that word because we've done everything up to the part where it starts to get hard... we have a web site, we have our idea, we've done the research and gotten all the licences... but now that the time to advertise and talk to people about it has come, we've found every reason to put it off... Has our business failed?  No because we haven't even TRIED!  So, why do I relate all of this and what does it have to do with (after all what this site is about) my fitness journey?  Well I do the same thing here... On previous journeys I've found myself slipping, and often I've done it because it was easier to slip, to not really TRY then to come to the end of some time period and find out I've 'failed'.  So what makes this time different?  First of all I've made a major mindset change.  I finally figured out that the only way I can fail is if I quit.  And yet I still see small signs of that 'slacker' in the things that I do.  I see it what I was doing with my eating before.  Not the under eating, but the lack of dicipline before that, eating hotdogs, and white bread etc.  I see it today in my saying 'I can't do HIIT today'.  Yes, it hurts... yes it will be hard, but I have to TRY.  I have to give it my 100% effort.  I have to take 'extraordinary action'.

      The days continue to go great!  I'm working my tail off and eating so clean I squeek.  I'm struggling a little bit today as I would rather have ANYTHING but the chicken and rice that I brought for lunch right now.  But I'll get through.  Maybe an extra soda will get rid of the major sweet tooth that I'm suffering.  I had a bowl of my 'homemade' jello to eat, but that's not doing much besides give me a stomach ache :(.    I know it's my body reacting to the dramatic reduction in fat intake.  I know it's good, but that doesn't make it easier.  Still, I'm losing weight and feeling energetic.  I had an awsome lower body workout last night, and my legs (especially my glutes) are sore.  I'm going to go for a 30 minute walk today, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to push myself through a HIIT run.  We'll see.  I can't start a patern of slacking - it's too easy to slide downhill, after missing even just one workout.  I still haven't desided what to do to continue to push myself.  Do I get heavier dumbells?  Or do I join a gym.  I'm going to have to figure out how to frame my cardio training when I can't run outdoors anymore.  I know I can't just assume I'll run in the rain.  I tried that before, it didn't work.  There are a lot of things that still need to be worked out.  But in the meantime I'm still working hard and still losing wieght! 192 today.  Still reshaping my body, and that's a REALLY good thing.

      The decision I made yesterday was exactly what I needed.  Now all the stress and pressure is off of me to figure out my own fitness routine.  It's all on Bill :)  I did a killer upper body workout last night and I still feel it today.  It's a good soreness.  My cold is almost complely gone already.  I woke up this morning feeling slightly groggy, and dizzy, but within a few hours it was gone.  All that's left now is a little bit of drainage.  I'm SO glad.    My nutrition is going GREAT.  I've started my new menu plan and I'm loving everything so far.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the week.  I'm eating a ton more fruit then I'm used to, but still feeling nice level energy levels.  That's a first for me.  I do so much better when someone else does my menu for me.  I don't know why.  Eventually, I'll have to learn to write my own, but for now I'm liking having someone else do it for me.  I took my first measurments since week 4.  I was so sure I had made NO progress in 2 weeks.   To my surprise I've actually lost a few inches off my butt, hips and thighs.  Now I want to make some MAJOR progress over the rest of my challenge.  I was also a pound down this morning so that helps.  I'm feeling VERY positive now, I want to hold onto this feeling and roll with it!

      When I started this whole challenge I commited myself to doing it BFL Style.  And here it is, just a few weeks later, and I've already done my level best to screw it all up.  I started tweeking, and modifying and changing until there was no BFL left in my program! Luckily I've had the support of some very smart people and they've got my nutrition in line.  Now I need to turn my excercise around.  I slid, I have for two weeks now, and my body shows it!  So it's back to basics.  Back to weight training 3 times per week alternating between upper and lower body workouts.  High Intensity Interval Training 3 days a week, and moderate cardio when I can work it in.  I also want to throw some pilates in there because I felt so good while I was doing it.  I'm 1/2 way through my challenge and I'm going to get back on track and start seeing the results that I saw at the begining of the first 1/2.    Today is Upper body - I'm going to hit it HARD and give it ALL I've got.  There - I've committed.

      I fell off the wagon, HARD this weekend.  Add that to the fact that I'm being hammered by a cold, or alergies or something, and I could be down in the dumps right now, but I'm not.  Instead I'm recharged, refocused and I've reset my goals.  I have a new menu plan, and tonight I'll finish up my shopping.  I'm not sure about my training yet.  I feel like I'm doing something wrong, but I'll just have to keep on plugging along.  Trial and error.  I sat down and had to figure out where I am on all the challenges I'm part of.  I keep finding new ways to keep myself focused.  This is the 7th week of my binkini babe challenge, 1st Week of the body blog challenge, and 3rd week of the Winter Wonderbabe challenge!  sheesh!    I knew this weekend was going to blow my progress, and it did.  I weighed in at 194.  I'm wondering how long it's going to take me to get back down to the 190 I was last week!  kind of depressing to think about, but I knew what I was doing when I did it, and accepted the consiquenses and the time.    Ok, tonight - Back and Chest.  This will include push ups.  I already did my low intensity cardio at lunch today.  It felt great to get that out of the way.  I'm hoping I can do some pilates too, as I felt that did a LOT to add to my progress the first 4 weeks.  I just need to start popping vitamine C I think.  I can't let this cold drag me down!   More Sleep too!

      The past few days have been MUCH much better.  No upset stomach, no shakyness, no tiredness.  I've been averaging around 1200 calories for the past few days and what a difference it's made.  Was suffering a bit from TOM- and didn't get my run in.  It's going to be a GREAT outdoor active weekend, so I'm not really that concerned about it.  I'm still REALLY sore from doing pushups the other day.  I'm going to add that as a perminant part of my workout!  hopefully one day I'll be able to do 'full' pushups instead of 'girl' ones.   We went to dinner last night with my Grandmother.  Chinese Buffett.  At first I panicked wondering how I was going to have self control, but after I had a few bites I started feeling full pretty quickly and actually ended up staying right on plan.  I was getting a little annoyed because my Grandmother commented more then once 'Is that all you are going to eat?"  I answered yes, that I was full, but my fiance' did like how little I had eaten eather so had me go back with him for seconds.  So I grabbed a little fruit.  AGAIN I got from my grandmother "You sure didn't eat much", and my fiance' said "She never does any more".  It was a little frustrating.  I've never had the people around me do that to me before.  My fiance' I understand because he knows what I went through with eating too little, but my grandmother too!  Sheesh!  In all, I think I did ok...

      Remember the slogen (I believe created by Weight Watchers) "Nothing taists as good as thin feels."?  Well, I've always thought it was a bunch of bunk.. and last night I was sure of it.  Aparently I've been WAY under eating...  I showed my menus to a group of people on one of the boards I go to and I was nearly beheaded! (Not really...)  Everyone jumped in to say "You're not eating enough!".   I was pretty much already convinced of it yesterday afternoon, I went home early from work.  I just felt so awful. My stomach was upset and I was so tired I felt like a complete ZOMBI. When I got home I just sat on the couch - I knew there was no way I could work out feeling like I did. My fiancé and his son got home and they decided to order pizza. I figured I would have a salad but when that pizza hit the door, I KNEW that wasn't happening! So I made a conscious decision to have pizza. I took two, ate slowly and enjoyed, NO savored every bite. I sat there for about 1/2 an hour and was STILL hungry. So I took one more and ate it. a hour later I was STILL hungry, so I had another! That's right 4 pieces of pizza! When I finished I was finally satisfied not STUFFED, but satisfied. AND I was feeling better!  There was NO way that being thin would feel as good as that pizza taisted right then.    I started this journey eating about 1500 calories/day. Then I got down to 1200, then 1000, and lately I found I was down to 700 to 800! Definitely NOT Good. I went to bed last night DETERMINED to ask for help. I know I shouldn't be feeling the way I have been, but I had no idea how to increase my calories and still lose the weight. And even MORE baffling was that when I weighed this morning I had lost 2 lbs since yesterday!?  So, I got to work this morning and opened up my email and not one but TWO people had already emailed me, offering help and even menus. I have to admit that I sat at my desk with tears in my eyes. I had already resolved this morning NOT to quit. I realized that the only way I can fail is to quit and I will NOT fail. But seeing all the love and support that I have been offered here has made that resolution that much easier to take.  Monday I start my new menu.  But I'm already trying to add more calories into my day.  And I'm feeling better for it.

      Wow last night was tough!  I went to do my cardio/legs and near the end I just could NOT go any more!  I had to stop.  After that I drank some accelerade, rested, ate dinner and after that I did my shoulders and arms.  I WAS so tired afterwords.  I wasn't feeling good, and I felt so fat, helpless and hopeless.  It was a horrible overwhelming feeling.  I sat down and started journaling what I was feeling and where I was going, and slowly I started feeling better!  It was wonderful.  I know I still I have a long way to go, but I also know I'm taking steps and I'm headed in the right direction.  I'll be so glad when I no longer have a body that I HATE.   I emailed an amature fitness competitor who was featured on bodybuilding.com.  She's made a WONDERFUL transformation from 200lbs to a 3rd place competitor.  To my surprise she emailed back.  I'm continuously surprised by the amount of support and inspiration I'm finding.

      I love going to www.bodychangers.com for inspiration.  I've collected a list of women with similar body type to mine who have made changes in thier body's that are truely to be admired.  Today I sat down and documented thier progress and averaged it.  It seems that most of them did NOT loose 2/lbs per week.  The average ws 1.92 with some of these women with LONG transfermations averaging less then 1.  Perhaps it's time to reevaluate my goals.  I really don't want to feel like I'm constantly falling short.  So far in 6 weeks I've averaged 1.7 lbs per week.  At that rate I should reach my goal by the 25th of May.  Not too bad, and I should be in GREAT shape by May 4th wich was my long term goal.  at 1.7 lbs per week I should be losing about 7 lbs a month.  In all, not bad.  I think I will adjust my goals accordingly.  And if I do better then that.  MORE POWER TO ME! :)  So, my new short term goals are this...    October 1st 185.5 November 1st  178  I really want to 'hit' the rest of this month HARD and make some more MAJOR changes in my bod.

      Wow, I've really been falling behind here!  I need to get better at journaling.  First the good news.  1)  I was 192 this morning!  2)  I fit into and wore size 14 shorts yesterday.  3) I've been feeling not nessisarily 'thinner' but 'less dense'  I haven't really been seeing much of a change in my measurements, but it seems that my clothes continue to fit better.   It's like the fat is 'fluffed out' to fill the same space, but that there really is less of it!  I just feel Great!  I wish the weight was coming off faster, but I'm still really thrilled with the results so far.  I'm going to have to keep better track of my progress this week!

      I had a great long weekend.  AND I stayed on plan.  Friday night I picked up pizza, and while it WAS within my limit and thus "on plan"  I was shocked to wake up Saturday morning with my weight UP to 194.5 from 193 the day before!  My hands were swollen and I felt terrible.  Today I finally started dropping weight again (194).  I don't know if there was something 'bad' in that pizza, if it was my 'monthly' water gain, or both.  On the workout side of the house things have been going GREAT.  I worked out a LOT this weekend and felt great because of it.  I tried doing the 'intermdiate' pilates and BOY was that hard.  I also did my 'new' lower body workout 'high reps-low weight' on Monday and loved it.  I was sweating like crazy!  It WAS a bit intense though, and I took the day off  from the lower body yesterday because I was achy all over.  I did do my High Intensity Interval Training Run yesterday though.  The running has been going GREAT.    I really can't believe how easy the nutrition has gotten.  I have no trouble staying less then 1200 Calories a day, when before I would struggle with 1400!  Water hasn't been an issue eather, and it's even better now that I have my own 'special' water bottle that holds 1 litre of water.  4 of those and the water is in the ... umm bag? heheheh.  It's even been easier to do my workouts - I find myself talking myself INTO them instead of OUT of them like I used to.   I took progress pictures on Monday and WOW!  I HAVE made a difference.  The biggest I could see was in my back.  My old pictures I looked like a linebacker!  The new pictures are MUCH more feminin.  My fiance has made a habit of telling me how skinny I am every time he gives me a hug.  It makes me look forward to even better results and more suprises for him.  What a turn around in my outlook!

      Woke up feeling really bad this morning, and while we had a bit of fun at work with it being Halloween and all I've been feeling gradually worse. I'm popping calcium and vitamine C hoping I'll get some energy back, but so far no go. I slept really badly again last night and that may have something to do with it. I need to get home and take some Vitamine B6... heck I need to take ALL my vitamine's I've fallen WAY behind on my suplimentation.  I've stayed green today despite the bowls of candy, and mounds of food people brought in. It helps that my stomach is upset and I don't really feel like eating. No cravings there! I'm still vacilating on weather or not I'll do cardio tonight... I don't want to miss, but I feel so lousy!! Still a few hours to go, so we'll see.

      Well! Let me tell you about my day...  The afternoon started going downhill. I started getting a headache, and my throat started hurting. I actually went home early because my neck and shoulders hurt so bad I couldn't stand to look at the computer anymore. THEN when I got home my fiance and I had some chores to take care of that left me feeling even MORE depressed and worn out. All I wanted to do was curl up in bed and shut out the world! But, when I went into my room to change I grabed for my workout clothes. I knew that if I had them on I would have one less excuse NOT to workout. Before I could motivate myself though, I called my daughter to find out when I was picking her up for trick-or-treating, and she informed me that she wanted to stay at her dad's because they had been invited to a Halloween party. Another blow! I know that if I hadn't already changed into workout clothes I would have said 'forget it'! BUT somewhere inside of me I KNEW I would feel better when I was through. So I pulled out the pilates matt and started my practice. The nice thing about pilate's is that even though it's not as metaphysical as yogo, it does involve a lot of controlled movements and deep breathing. As I sat there taking my first DEEP breathes and lengthening my spine and imagined that with each breath out I was pushing all those black ugly feelings OUT of my body. I exhaled, and exhaled and exhaled until I couldn't any more, pushing all the negative thoughts, feelings and doubts OUT of my mind and away from my soul. It was the COOLEST feeling! By the time I finished I KNEW I was ready for my lower body workout... and it ROCKED!! TOTALLY kicked my butt. My legs were SHAKING by the end and I was near the puking point. Not bad for a workout that never got beyond a 6.5 lb dumbell! AND... I did full situps! 3 sets of 15.. I couldn't do even 1 just a few months ago.. another victory. Much more then one in my book.  I figured out I was doing someting that I didn't even realize until now. A long time ago when I was going to counceling (one of the few postive things I can pull out of my failed marriage) one of the 'assignments' I was given was to write down three postive things about my (then) spouse every day. While that didn't save my marriage I always did think it was a valid technique... The theory being that the best way to get rid of negative thoughts is to think postive thoughts :) And I've found that I do that in my journey. Every day I try to pull the postive out of what I'm doing. Maybe the scale didn't move, but HEY, this skirt fits better! I'm boosting my OWN self esteme by replacing my negative thoughts about myself with new postive thoughts, and I think it's had a lot to do with the bounce in my step and the smile on my face. AND it makes it that much easier to eat good food and move my butt and excercise. After all, if I LIKE myself how can I NOT want to take care of me?

      Tomorrow is Halloween already! Holy CRUD! where has this year gone!? Funny thing is, I'm really looking forward to next year. And not just because we're getting married! I'm finding I'm looking forward to the future a LOT more then I used to. Could be the company I keep (having a loving partner helps a lot) and it could be that I feel as though I'm finally taking CHARGE! I'm the boss of my own destiny, and it feels good!  I'm still sore today from Tuesday's upper body workout. I didn't realize my delts were in such sucky shape! OUCH! I'm glad I'm giving myself some time to recover.  OK, the wierdest thing just happened to me. One of the guys here at work got an email from his brother regarding some guys transformation story. The guy I work with was just dumbfounded and kept saying.. "This can't be REAL!" So _I_ HAD to jump in... showed him Bodychangers, and the body for life program. He was like.. WOW! I could do that! I had to tell him, heck _I'm_ doing that. He just couldn't believe that someone could make those sort of changes in 12 weeks. I had to tell him a bit of my story and several timies reasure him that these guys were putting about 1 hour in the gym a day.. not the "3 or 4" that he was thinking... Was just so wierd to be looked at as the 'expert'...And now I've got even more pressure (wich I like) to stick with it. I have something to PROVE to the folks here. There are several people here who will be watching to see my stumble... Oh, and someone mentioned.. "Yeah! you can Really see the weight you've lost!" that was cool too.  OH, and the scale said 181 today.. .I can see the 170's on the horizon and I'm SO excited about it!!

      Billy Blanks just kicked my... tooshie!!  It was GREAT... the best part is I didn't poop out until the last few minutes (I'm guessing it's the push for the 10)  I've noticed his workouts really seem to be based on intervals.. you ramp up and then cool down, then ramp up again... I loved it, had fun and was glad no one was around to watch me!! I'm not the most coordinated person in the world lol!  I also did my pilate's... three days in a row now!  I'm on a ROLL!!! (as aposed to eating them)  PS.. no heart flutters during this workout.. YAY!

      I had the strangest thing happen to me today!   While visiting one of the other offices, twice I ran into girls who, when seeing them before, I had though "I wish I had a body like that!" This time, though I found myself thinking, "I could have a better body then that!" After the second time it happened I stopped myself, amazed. Never in my life have I ever thought of myself in such positive terms! I'm alowing myself to believe in.. ME! and it's the GREATEST feeling. I'm finally being honest with myself, honoring my promices, and you know what, the respect is now showing! Then, to add on top of that one of the ladies at work said to me "You've lost weight!"... Then (and this really cracked me up) the girl that never gives compliments unless she wants something started to say something nice to me... Then stopped because she realized she didn't need anything at that time. It cracked me up that she started to let a compliment slip, almost as if she MEANT it.. lol!  Needless to say I'm feeling good about my progress, both inside and outside. I can't wait to see what happens next!  One thing I'm NOT pleased with... I'm sure I've mentioned before that I have a 'mild' heart issue. I've managed to do a pretty good job of managing it on my own, especially since I quit taking ephedra (sp?). But I noticed that I started getting palpitations last night while working out, and they've continued through today. This FRUSTRATES me to no end! They arn't dangerous (so my dr says) but they are uncomfortable (imagine hiccups) and leave me feeling week. And as far as I know, I've done nothing that should have brought this on. The only thing that I can come up with is that I'm tired. I've been going to bed early enough but have noticed that I'm having trouble falling into a DEEP sleep and spend most of the night just below the surface of sleep and having some BIZZARE and vivid dreams! (Last night I drempt that I was bit by a snake and when he pulled away he left his fang behind, still pumping venom into my leg - like a bee stinger - analize THAT one would ya? I think the snake is my ex :P) Anyway, all that to say I need to work on sleeping better, see if that clears up the issue, and if not it's back to NO caffine.. and if that doesn't work *sigh* I guess I go on the beta blockers. QUESTION - the beta blockers are supposed to lower my blood pressure and help me relax (ummm.. why lower my blood preasure when it's already normal to low is beyond me) My worry has always been that they might also lower my metabolism... does anyone know if there could be any facts behind this??  So enough of my whining! :)

      woke up a little stiff and sore today, but it’s a GOOD kind of stiff and sore! I’m feeling my workout in my biceps and even my BACK! That’s a place where I feel like I’ve been missing. Also feeling a little in my upper abs. Love cross bench pullovers, they feel so awesome! Food is on track for the day, and I’m actually drinking WATER! Funny, I went to the vending machine to buy a diet soda, put in my money, pushed the button and nothing came out! I took that a my sign that I didn’t need any soda! So, I filled up my 1 ltr water bottle and I’m over ½ way through it. 3.5 liters left to go!

      I just finished my first upper body workout of my new plan. Higher reps, more excrecises and WAY lighter weights. I can't believe how light I had to go to finish. I felt like a complete WIMP. I am now DRENCHED in sweat and in pain from my ribs UP! I also did a 10 minute pilate's session and am feeling good about keeping at it for two days in a row! I truely feel as though I kicked it up a notch tonight! I can't wait to see what I'm going to do in the next six weeks!   The good news is I was able to do all excrercises without 'bad' pain. Including upright rows! Yay!!  Nutrition has been spot on today and I'm looking at another green. The only bad news is that TOM is right around the corner :( (TMI alert) It just NOT fair! I struggle every time TOM is around and THEN I have the whole PDD issue AND my cycle is only twenty one days... and lasts 7. It seems like I hardly have a day when I'm not battling! But this time I'm determined to make it through GREEN! I will I will I will!!

      Yesterday was my reward day, and what do _I_ crave? Was it chocolate cake? or perhaps a taste of those cookies that drove me nuts last week? No! _I_ crave a turkey sandwich on sliced sourdough w/swiss cheese. The funny thing is that USED to be 'diet food' to me. What a bizzare world I live in now. For dinner I had one of my all time favorites, pasta mixed with olive oil and a little parmisian cheese (and veggies of course). Was NICE.  I added pilate's back into my routine last night. While it was a rest day from cardio or weights it felt REALLY good to get out on the mat and get all my parts feeling lean and long. Well as long as they get on my 5'5" frame. I'm hoping to add that 10 minute pilate's set as a regular part of my daily workout (unless someone can convience me that it is 'bad' to do daily) I should be hitting the weights for an upper body workout today, and I'm really feeling excited. Funny, but I think I've caught the 'bug'. More then excited about my workout, I'm finding that I'm excited about the future, and find myself contimplating what changes are going to happen next. It's so novel and refreshing to be looking forward to changes instead of dreading them.

      Had an EXCELLENT weekend. Friday night I hit the house ready to go for my run, and my sweetie and his son were dressed and ready to come with me! Was a VERY pleasant surprise. We all headed to the track together and I have to say, each day I run I’m surprising myself at how I’m feeling and the progress I’ve been able to make. My fiancé who hadn’t seen me run for a LONG time was really pleased and surprised at how ‘fast’ I was moving (fast for me). And I blew him away when I sprinted the 100 at the end… not once but TWICE. He was like “Wow! You were really moving!”.  Saturday I picked up my Youngest daughter. We spent the day treating her for her birthday (which was earlier this month). I kept it green. Then Sunday, we went for a LONG hike along the coast. It wasn’t too hard as we had the kids along, but there were a few hills and I worked up a little sweat. I came home and blasted out a lower body workout later and basically wrapped up the weekend totally GREEN!! It felt GREAT!  My daughter stayed the extra night, and I drove her the 100+ miles to school this morning. Funniest thing on my way back to work I had a truck driver pace me for a bit (which kind of freaked me out as I drive a little black bug) The pull ahead and give me the “ooo la la…” and “OK” sign, the fall back behind me. Guess he liked what he could see from way up there. I waved a thank you and got a light flash in return. I guess I’m a little strange in that I’ll take a compliment where I can get it! And always try to be courteous in return.  I’m starting to get a little concerned as my weight drops. Any other time I’ve had serious weight loss it starts to tail off and/or stop completely between 180 and 175. This is not because of anything my body does, but because I start to feel ‘comfortable’, about that weight. That’s when I got from HATING my body to merely disliking it, and the sacrifices that I used to make to get to that weight didn’t seem to be worth it any more. Of course no other time have I combined working out with dieting. But, this time I’m determined it will be different. Why? Because this time it’s about so much more then hating the way I look. It’s about challenging myself, and meeting that challenge head on. It’s also about loosing weight sensibly and being focused on keeping it ‘green’ and not just about seeing the scale go down. Lately I’ve found that the scale going down is just a happy bi-product of the work I’m doing, not the be-all end-all means. These are the mindsets I’m bringing with me through the next six weeks…

      Saturday I finally lost the battle with the 'lazy' me and talked myself out of my workout. I had battled with that little witch for two days, managing to win and do my workout Thursday and Friday, but Saturday I just couldn't do it!  But, it's monday a new week, and another chance to hit greens every day.  The good news: I'm down a few more pounds - the totals from the past three weeks look impressive :)   Weight Loss: 8 lbs Body Fat Loss: 13.5 lbs Muscle Gained: 5.5 lbs  I measure in 14 places (If you count right and left arms and leg seperately) and have lost a total of 16.5 inches. Including 3 inches off my waist.   I can't wait until Next Sunday when I take my 4 week progress pictures! Even though Thrusday's and Friday's workouts were SO hard. I'm very very glad I did them

      I cranked out a killer upper body workout tonight. Hit my triceps like never before, THEN I got down and did 10.. that's right 10 pushups! I reached my goal already!! I went back and checked my jornal and I did my first 'real' pushup on Sept 19th. So in just over a month I've increased 10 times!!

      Feeling good and looking good today. Had a girl at work say my face is looking thinner. She's one of the few I've told I'm dieting, and is known for giving out compliments when she wants something from people, so I had to take it with a grain of salt. Still, I'm feeling really good. I'm starting to feel as though I have the 'power' again. You ladies know what I'm talking about right? The one that makes a group of guys go quiet when you walk by... in a positive way. *grin* I'm working on remembering to improve my posture throughout the day. Standing taller and hold in my abs. I know I'm regaining my "I've got a secret" grin because people give me that puzzled look from time to time. I feel GREAT! lol! I just re-read what I've posted an realized that I've now said I feel good three times! I guess that's how good I feel!  I caught a group of folks talking about a diet they are doing together. When I asked them about it they said it was called "The Kaiser Diet" I did a search and couldn't find anything so when I asked further I got some murmer about it being a diet where you "Eat what they tell you for three days and then eat whatever you want for the other four". The alarm bells IMMEDIETLY went off in my head and I did another search, this time for "Three Day Diet". WOW - I can't believe that people would do this to themselves and actually believe it's healthy!?  for those of you like me who had never heard of it before, here it is...  (snipped from http://www.mikebrownsolutions.com/3day.htm)  -----------------------------  The Basic Diet 1. The first day of this diet you fast. During the fast, drink plenty of water.  2. The second day you consume only fruit and fruit juices.  3. The third day you consume only vegetables and vegetable juices.  4. The rest of the week you eat normally. Just don't overdo it.  You can use this diet for as many weeks as you want.  You may want to do it once a month.  Everytime you complete the three-day diet you will lose weight.  It is impossible not to do so.  -------------------------  Yeah, starve yourself for three days.. it's impossible not to lose weight! THAT'S a GREAT solution  I'll just have to keep plugging along in my own journey and hope that eventually they will see in me a HEALTHY way lose that fat...  And yet... I doubt anyone will ask. I have discovered that folks are more likely to talk to other overweight folks about diets and weightloss then to someone who's fit (myself included) It's as if we don't want to REALLY face what it takes to make the changes. The one girl who complimented me on my weightloss KINDOF asked me what I was doing, but as soon as she found out I wasn't taking a 'magic pill' or anything like that her eyes glazed over.  Not much else to report. Clean eats so far and should continue to be so. Have upper body planned for tonight. My last one for this challenge, I'm going to hit it for all I'm worth. OH, and I didn't win the lottery *sigh*

      When I agreed to make cookies for my sweetie, I knew it would be hard. If I had known HOW hard, I wouldn't have.  I started by KNOWING I would be craving big time after words so before even leaving for the store I made myself some pudding w/protein. Butterscotch! YUM! While making the cookies, I actually used my mixer stand so that I could just dump in ingredients and let it whir. I thought that might give me a little 'mental distance' from the process. And it did help. BUT... My fingers still got messy. And while mixing the chips in by hand, it was all I could do not to spoon a little out to taste it. *groan* By the time I was done I SWEAR I was SHAKING! Instead of putting myself through the torture of an hour of spooning dough onto sheets, watching them bake and then levering them off all hot and gooey I dumped all the batter into a pan and baked it all at once. It will have to do. In the meanwhile, my sweetie has fallen asleep. Ce La Vi  I have since enjoyed GUILT FREE my pudding and am feeling quite satiated.  One other thing to share...While showering I was thinking about my workouts and what I'm going to do starting next week. It's not so much that BFL isn't working, but that I feel the need to change things up a bit. I was thinking of the different splits and routines that I know and pretty much decided that the 2-day split works for me. After all, splitting more then that is usually the result of wanting more bulk, wanting to focus harder on particular body parts, and give them more time to recover. I just want to stay toned and burn as many calories as possible. Then I started going through what I knew of sets, pyramid sets, supersets etc. I started mulling super sets and then remember a workout program that I used YEARS ago from a lady called Dr Joyce Vedral. Some of you probably know of her. She had one workout called 'The Fat Burning Workout' that combined super sets. and a pyramid weight scheme. I think I'll go buy the book this weekend. The workout as she prescribes it involves workout out with weights everyday... that part I'll have to see about.  For Cardio, I stopped by THE other local gym. They are as horribly expensive as the first I checked out (though beautifully maintained) and pretty much outside my budget, BUT they offer a 10-visit pass for $113. I figure if I use it two times during the week for cardio, and then do something outside on the weekends... it would get me through 5 weeks. Not too terribly bad. An option but not a final decision as yet.

      It wasn't until I headed out the door that I realized it had been over a week since I had ran! Cardio last week was so.. WIERD. Yet, I think it was a break my body needed because I hit the track with more energy then ever! The time just flew by and everytime I checked my watch I was past time to change intensity by 7 to 10 seconds! I was enjoying myself THAT much. I even threw in a sprint at the end. It's rather to sad for me to think that this is going to be my last week of evening runs... with the time change this weekend it will be dark when I get home and sadly enough, in todays society I don't go running in the dark, alone. I'm going to push to run on the weekends though, and perhaps the cross-training will do me some good. Shake things up a bit.  On my way home I noticed that my sweat pants are getting baggy! It's funny that the past few weeks, I've been so convinced that I'm seeing no progress that it really surprises me when I do find something.  oh well, I'm off to the store... my honey came home not feeling well and asked for chocolate chip cookies... I'm usually a bater taister so this is going to be a REAL challenge for me!!

      I'm frustrated because I'm stuck at home today. I had some work I needed to get done but I forgot to grab the bank card from my honey this morning, and I have NO GAS. Luckily my work is flexable enough I can stay home. I think I'll work on clearing alittle of the chaos up around the house and add a little peace back in. (Housework is not my favorite thing in the work.)  I woke up feeling "skinny" this morning. A mirror check felt pretty positive too. Having a good day. I'm really excited about the weekend as both my daughters will be visiting. I'll get my oldest to take my challenge 'ending' pictures for me. Maybe this time I'll get her to come on a run with me too. She worries me sometimes as she's only 5'2" and already 145lbs at 15. While some of that is muscle (she plays water polo and softball) I know that they eat like CRAP at thier dad's house. Fast food at least once a day. I think she does some of the things I did as a teenager, like not eating all day then stuffing herself at dinner. I'm thinking that this weekend we'll have a really honest talk, but I'm not sure how to do that without coming off ALL wrong. After all, how do I say... "Honey, your fat, and I'm worried it's just going to get worse..."?

      Had a crappy evening, worked til 7:00, fiance had puter troubles and lost 3 hours of work, and I'm still tired from my bike ride on sunday... BUT, I did my leg workout anyway AND upped the weight on my squats! can I say 'I'm proud of me'? Eats were clean, drank a bit of water and I'm ready for BED!!

      No workout for me last night. It was time spend recovering!! Ate clean though and felt great all day! I've got a bag full of healthy foods ready for today (I have to work until 7:00 tonight) and I'm ready to go!  Planning on a Lower body workout today, should be interesting to see what I can do after that ride on Sunday.  Also, I'm looking into changing up my plan starting next week. Looking into different splits, different rep styles etc. I know that 1 thing I'm going to do is make a change to my cardio. I LOVE the HIIT, but according to the Hussman website I may be able to burn more fat by ADDING 10 minutes of moderate cardio to that. His suggestion is to the end, but I'm thinking I'll add it to the begining, because usually at the end of my HIIT I'm to tired to walk another STEP.

      I got frustrated with my computer as the virus scan started and I couldn't do anything else.. darn slow thing, so I wandered over to TJMaxx and drove the fitting room girl mad by trying on boatloads of clothes. I'm not quite ready to say I'm a '14' yet. Jeans and skirts I can fit into a 14 9 out of 10 times, but slacks... it's about a 50/50 chance they will fit. BUT I have noticed something intersting... I have an a$$! Seriously. I mean, it's always been THERE, WIDE. But, it curved up from my thighs, and then just went up and joined my back.. FLAT! But now I've got a curve at the top AND the bottom! It's really cool to put on a pair of jeans, turn around and think.. HEY I've got a butt. It must be the excercises, because I've been at this weight before. I can't wait to see what other changes start to show!!

      Yes, it's Monday, and the first day of my last week of my first 12 week BFL challenge... (How's that for confusing?) I'm feeling UP UP UP!! I rolled over in bed this morning and thought.. Oh my god! I'm sore! But then I got up and walked around a bit, and it turned out to just be a little stiffness, not 'real' sorness. My 'pelvic floor' is a bit saddle sore, and my hips have a bit of lingering twinges but otherwise I feel FANTASTIC. The fact that I can have a day like yesterday and still feel HUMAN afterwords has made the last 11 weeks well worth it!  THEN, I was leaving my house this morning and my neighbor was standing on the porch having his morning ciggy. I don't see him often as he works nights, me days so when we do say 'hello' it's usually when one or both of us is running in or out the door. I got a cheery 'Good Morning' and a 'How are you doing?' then he says, "Have you lost weight?". I'm sure I BEEMED because, as I've said before NO ONE has said anything up 'til now. After I acknowldged him, he said "I thought so, I was sitting here thinking, man, she looks DAMN good." I'm not sure how to take my neighbor thinking I look DAMN good, but hey I'm glad someone noticed..  My day is going as 'planned' I had a GREAT breakfast of cream of wheat with protien powder.. NUMMY. I've got yogurt and protien for 'snack' and a salad with SPICY chicken for lunch. This is going to be a greener, then green week my friends.. you can count on it!  Oh, and my waist was down to 35" this morning, hips to 45.5" Yay!  Today I CHOOSE to lose weight!

      I fell hard this weekend. I kept loosing my focus and sight of my goals… and then today, I turned it around!  Let’s start with Friday. All the crap at work just can crashing down on my head. After lunch with my boss it was all I could do just to sit upright. I was a zombie for the rest of the afternoon. I got home, and just curled into a little ball of misery. My fiancé’ managed to coax me out of my shell by waving a piece of pizza under my nose! After drowning my sorrows in pepperoni and cheese, I thought I was finally ready to take control again. We spent some time discussing my goals and I was ready once more! Unfortunately, the damage was already done, and I had a red day! L  Saturday came and I drove 130 miles to see my daughter play in a water polo tournament. Seeing those girls in the pool inspired me all the more! I was ready to dive in the pool myself, swimming has always been MY sport. When I got home, though I was ready, willing and able to go out and spend some quality ADULT time with my sweetie. We went to an Irish Pub and my goals flew out the window again! Almost faster then I could think I had ordered a Black and Tan…BEER! Another day in the tank.  Today I woke up, with my goals fixed in my mind. I packed our bags with nuts, powerbars, apples and bananas rolled in protein powder and water, and then OFF we went to tackle some hills with out bikes. It was a BEAUTIFUL fall day. Not too hot, not too cold. 26 miles!! That’s right I put 26 miles (give or take) on my bike today. We started in Occidental and the trek started UPHILL. Neither of us made it to the top (we had to get off and push). But we WIZZED down into the beautiful Coleman Valley. We peddled past rolling meadows and ancient barns. The fall colors were amazing. Then back up some KILLER hills. All my training started to pay off, for as my fiance’ struggled (and HE’S always been the avid biker) I was ready to keep on peddling (and sometimes did). Not only did I feel I had gotten a payback from all the workouts in a physical sense, but mentally, all those times I did one more rep, one more interval, one more lap, one more step payed off too. More then once I gutted my way to the top of a hill, legs and lungs burning! The joy of speeding down the other side was 10 times more exhilarating knowing I had pushed myself to the fullest! We finally made it down the other side and headed toward the coast. We flew down one AWSOME downgrade and near the bottom at about the 10 mile mark I heard a ‘poof---ssssssssssss’ My fiance’s back tire had blown! Ripped the valve stem right off the tube, and us with no spare! We ended up walking a good portion of Highway 1 into Bodega Bay where we managed to jerry rig something to get us the rest of the way back. Still, the views of the ocean were magnificent, and the coastal breeze, perfect. The rest of the trip took us along Highway 1, Bodegea Highway (through Bodega where they filmed Alfred Hitchcock’s “the Birds”), and the Bohemian Highway. We passed rolling fields full of cattle, race horse ranches, and through a beautiful redwood forest. I couldn’t believe that I finished up with even MORE energy with when I started! Then, when I got home, I did my upper body workout so that Saturday wouldn’t be a RED day! I finally fell like all the work I’ve been doing these past months, MEANS something. I’m focused. This last week of my challenge will be STELLER and I’m ready to face whatever comes after it!

      My fiance and I had a little talk about my goals, beyond loosing weight. I want/need his buy in. He's a major stakeholder in this project so I sat and listened to his ideas and ideals and figured out how they fit in with mine. It turns out we're pretty much on the same page, YAY! He even dropped a few names of women he thought were 'strong yet feminine... like.. Rachel McLish and Lisa Lyon. We actually had a pretty cool time looking through pictures of buff ladies and finding physiques we BOTH liked :)  Of course I have a LONG way to go... But every journey starts with a single step!

      I had a nice strong leg workout last night. My legs are sore today and I have no doubt that it’s a good thing. My good mood continues. Something I vented must have needed to get out because I’ve felt great ever since. Thank you to everyone who shouted and/or emailed me. It was MUCH appreciated.  I have a meeting today with my bosses boss (and owner of the company) so perhaps we’ll iron some things out, and I know if I’m to go, or stay. It may be that I spend the weekend posting my resume on a plethora of job sites.  I took action on my foot issue last night as well and found a few interesting ideas on rehabilitating planter fasciitis, and strengthening ankles. I also found awesome information on how to tape my foot to prevent further straining the planter fascia. All that combined may get me off the track and back on the streets, AND allow me to train for a 5K and eventually I may be able to think about a marathon again! THAT has got me excited. All positive steps forward.  I also spent some time thinking about the whole visualization issue. I’m working on seeing my body in a positive light, and toward forming an idea of what I can/will look like. I’m going to spend a little time each day relaxing and reinforcing that image in my mind, so that I can get that goal firmly fixed. Who was it that said “You have to believe to achieve”? I’m starting to understand that statement and put it use.

      Ok, I finished my last post, and then went out for a walk. Cleared my head a bit.  First, a confession. I overslept and then rushed out of the house this morning, without food! So I stopped at the quickstop for breakfast. I was standing in the Asle looking at all the protien bars and grinding my teeth at the $3.00 price tag when I looked down and saw... POP TARTS! and they were only 75 cents! Without even a second thought I grabbed them, payed and rushed out the door to eat them! Yes, it was a bad choice. Yes it wasn't planned. But I think that will be my 'cheat meal' for the week. I will not let it derail me, not for the week, not for the day, not even for an hour. I'm back on plan with a nice chicken salad for lunch. (Can I justify it partially by saying they were STRAWBERRY pop tarts!? lol!)  Secondly, I went back and looked (again) at my older journal entries. There was something I remembered putting there that I needed to see again..  Here it is...  My notes and thoughts on George Leonard's Book called "Mastery, The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment". Basically, here's how I've applied his thoughts to my goal of weight loss and fitness.  Key 1: Instruction  I suppose a great deal of the blame for my failure to achieve "mastery" of my weight loss and fitness goals has been my lack of choosing an Instructor. Sure, I'll choose one for a while, but it usually doesn't last, and before long, I've moved on to some other method or teacher. Of course, there is a time and a place to move on, but I know I never have REALLY made a commitment. I'm not sure if I should decide now, how long to give this (BFL) to work, or wait. For now, I suppose it's enough that I've committed 12 weeks.  Key 2: Practice  At first, I thought this didn't apply. But then, I realized, at least in the realm of exercise or fitness, there is a time for practice. Then it came to me that in diet too there is practice. It just happens to be on that occurs every day. Sometimes every minute of every day. The key is, as they say, "Staying on the Path". "To practice regularly, even when you seem to be getting no where."  Key 3: Surrender  This was easy for me to spot as a problem area for me. Even when choosing a plan, I was constantly making my own modifications to it. I'm still doing that. Instead of accepting the teacher’s plan, I choose the parts I like and ignore the rest. There will be a time and place for that, but, for now, I'll cease to be "Player of all, Master of none"  Key 4: Internationality  Much of this is - practicing with purpose, but also there was a great deal here that has to do with visualization. Visualization is something I may currently have a problem with. Sure I can see myself exercising, eating correctly, and even running effortlessly, but I cannot, yet, visualize myself as thin toned, and in shape. I'm not even sure how to start. I can't remember ever feeling proud of my body, so I don't even have memories to go on. I'll continue to visualize what I can, and maybe the rest will come to me. It's something to research at the very least.  Key 5: The Edge  I'm not even close to looking over the edge... It may be years before I am... and I'm happy that way, for now.

      Why is it, when I struggle the most, it seems I blog the least? I think it's pride. This sense that I have that I have to be 'strong'. Add to that the feeling that I have that I shouldn't 'burden' others with my own pitiful whinings... and there you have it! :) Yesterday was one of those days that's colored with dull browns and grays. Fall is here, my body and spirit seem to know it, and every time the fog rolls in, I feel bleak. I did manage some cardio yesterday. Just a walk, but with the way my quads have been feeling, perhaps I needed the break. I also ate clean. Clean by my own standards... I've been getting frustrated, and perhaps a bit jealous (Ross and Petra *grin*) that NO-ONE has noticed my weight loss. How's that for an extraordinariless transformation? Yes, my fiancé notices.. but he's the only person in the world who sees me naked. I was telling myself that it was because 1) I work with mostly men and 2) They see me every day... BUT, yesterday I went to lunch with a friend whom I haven't seen eight weeks. She didn't say a WORD! Maybe I was just THAT good at camouflaging my weight? I know I shouldn't base my journey on others, but still it would be nice to get SOME kind of kudos from someone who doesn't KNOW I'm trying to loose weight.  I've also been fighting a frustration with my job. The situation is a little complicated in that, I'm a consultant working full time at one client. The client, I love. They give me exciting, challenging work that uses me to my full potential. Unfortunately, my company, does not pay me what I'm worth, nor do they acknowledge the skills I'm using and have developed. Even after passing my test, they still treat and pay me as a simple System Administrator (Not that there is anything wrong with being an administrator, but I haven't done actual technical work in over two years, it's all been project management) The issue isn't just the pay. There is also the fact that SOME day this contract will end, and I'll be 'brought back into the fold' and expected to go back to System Administration, a job I feel I'm no longer suited for. (Step away from technology for as little as 6 months and you've lost MILES) So, I'm fighting having to leave a client I love, so that I can pursue my career. The future is currently unstable and I hate that. THEN I hear that if/when I DO get another job is when my company is likely to move mountains to keep me to stay... I won't.  I'm not sure what any of the above have to do with my journey to fitness. I just know that I feel as if I'm currently on a journey of self discovery. A journey that seems to be taking a very circuitous rout. I feel a little lost and in desperate need of a road map. That lost feeling is spilling over into my diet and exercise. At the moment I feel... goal-less. I've been so disappointed so far when it comes to reaching goals that I've left off setting any. And yet, I KNOW I need them... I'm a person driven by goals. Perhaps that's why I feel so lost right now... I've been driven for 9 months with the goal of passing that test.. I have.. now what? Hmmm.. I hadn't thought of that until right now. Body wise, I'm thinking that perhaps I'll start setting some fitness goals rather then body/weight goals. Fitness goals I can control, I can achieve.. my body.. well it seems to have a mind of it's own. I feel good about my pushups. That's probably the ONE good thing I've picked out of my workout. For cardio.. I'm thinking perhaps I'll start training for a 5k or something similar. My only issue with that is my darn foot. I have GOT to find a way to rehabilitate it so that I can run on pavement again....That and overcoming the issue of the upcoming wet/cold season and lack of lighting... Bah! I've too much yet to work through, but I'm making a start... Thanks for letting me vent!

      I had an oops during my upper body workout, that turned into a 'right on'!  I was going through my workout. Kind of 'in the zone'. I've been doing it enough that I thought I had it pretty much memorized, and I only needed to use my log for slight reminders. So I finished my back, and flipped to the next page, assuming it was biceps. I loaded on the weight that I read there and did my first set of twelve. I immediatly started getting a little down because it was rather hard. I loaded on the next set of plates and tried to do my second set of ten. I was really getting bummed because it was all I could do to belt out that set! I finally looked over at my log and realized I was supposed to be doing SHOULDERS! I turned over to my 'normal' bicep routine and saw that the weight I had just done two sets at was DOUBLE what I had been doing on bis! So, I left that weight on and did a KILLER bicep workout! I was so inspired I upped the weight on my triceps too. I've got to figure out a way to add more weight to my chest excercises... OR.. maybe I'll switch my first excercise to flyes since that one seems to fatigue me faster...  I did 7 pushups in a row!!! I don't know where this inner strength is coming from but.. MAN I LOVE it! I think I'm going to sit back and imagine fat burning for a while and see if I can get my body to listen! :)

      I finally got back into the routine of planning my meals. This 'flying by the seat of my pants' thing was getting unnerving! I have food ready for tomorrow and I am ready to finish this 2 week sprint to the end of my FIRST TWELVE WEEKS! That's right, in two weeks I'll have finished my first 12 week challenge...The first of many, I'm sure. But there is something about COMPLETING that first one... In truth, I never really thought I would make it this far, and yet.. here I am! And there I continue to go! 14

      I'm read this GREAT book by George Leonard called "Mastery, The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment” In it he has a chapter called "Why Resolutions Fail - and What to do About it." I thought I would share some of this with you all as I'm sure you could relate...  His answer to why resolutions fail is Homeostasis or "The ability or tendency of an organism or cell to maintain internal equilibrium by adjusting its physiological processes". So, when we starting making changes, especially DRASTIC changes, Internally, Homeostasis kicks in, and makes us feel uncomfortable, so that things can remain "status quote” Externally, our family, friends, and/or coworkers may rebel in an effort to maintain the 'sameness' of their life, and/or their relationship with you. (Please understand I am paraphrasing). So how do we fight Homeostasis? Here are his tips...  1. Be aware of the way homeostasis works. This might be the most important guideline of all. Expect resistance and backlash. Realize that when the alarm bells start ringing, it doesn't necessarily mean you're sick or crazy or lazy or that you've made a bad decision. In fact, you might take these signals as an indication that your life is definitely changing -- just what you've wanted. Of course, it might be that you have started something that's not right for you; only you can decide. But in any case, don't panic and give up at the first sign of trouble.  You might also expect resistance from friends and family and co-workers. (Homeostasis, as we've seen, applies to social systems as well as individuals.) Bear in mind that an entire system has to change when any part of it changes. So, don't be surprised if some of the people you love start covertly or overtly undermining your self-improvement. It's not that they with you harm, its just homeostasis at work.  2. Be willing to negotiate with your resistance to change.  So, what should you do when you run into resistance, when the red lights flash and the alarm bells ring? Well, you don't back off, and you don't bull your way through. Negotiation is the ticket to successful long-term change in everthing from increasing your running speed to transforming your organizaiton. The fine art of playing the edge in this case involves a willingness to take one step back for every two forward, sometimes vice versa. It also demands a determination to keep pushing, but not without awareness. Simply turning off your awareness to the warnings deprives you of guidance and risk damaging the system. Simply pushing your way through despite the warning signals increases the possibility of backsliding.  You can never be sure exactly where the resistance will pop up. A feeling of anxiety? Psychosomatic complaints? A tendency toward self-sabotage? Squabbles with family, friends, or fellow workers? None of the above? Stay alert. Be prepared of serious negotiations.  3. Develop a support system  You can do it alone, but it helps a great deal to have other people with whom you can share the joys and perils of the change you’re making. The best support system would involve people who have gone through or are going through a similar process, people who can tell their own stories of change and listen to yours, people who will brace you up when you start to backslide and encourage you when you don’t.  4. Follow a regular practice.  People embarking on any type of change can gain stability and comfort through practicing some worthwhile activity on a more or less regular basis, not so much for the sake of achieving an external goal as simply for its own sake. The circumstances are particularly happy in case you’ve already established a regular practice in something else before facing the challenge and change of beginning a new one.  5. Dedicate yourself to lifelong learning  We tend to forget that learning is much more then book learning. To learn is to change. Education, weather it involves books, body, or behavior, is a process that changes the learner. It doesn’t have to end at college graduation or at age forty or sixty or eighty, and the best learning of all involves learning how to learn – that is to change. The lifelong learning is essentially one who has learned to deal with homeostasis, simply because he or she is doing it all the time

      I'm a little low in the enthusiasim department today. Non-body related stuff has me down, work etc. It's left me with little energy for outside stuff. Planning an upper body workout tonight. I've gotten to the point where my workouts don't depend on weather I 'feel' like it or not. I'm tired, cranky, and unenthused, but I'll do it anyway. Much like Ed I was a 110% or nothing kind of gal for so long... It used to be that if I didn't feel like working out, if I wasn't BOUNDING my way to the gym and ready to give every ounch of who I was.. I just didn't go. Now I realize that I need to workout, weather or not I 'feel' like it. 1 - because it usually makes me feel better and I usually end up giving 110% in the end anywawy. and 2 - because every MOMENT I'm doing something is another step in my journey. Yeah, I might be walking, or even CRAWLING rather then running, but I'm still moving and in the correct direction.  I checked my body fat measurement again today, just to make sure that had gotten an 'accurate' (accurate as is possable on a scale) reading. It came up 38.6% again, so I'm pretty confident in that number. And yes, that means I've lost 12.5lbs of fat and gained 5.6lbs of muscle in four weeks. So, when does this muscle I've been gaining, fianlly start doing it's job and start burning more fat!? lol Overall, in 10 weeks, I've lost 28 lbs of fat, and gained 12.5 lbs of muscle. I still find myself sore on a regular basis, so I feel like I'm pushing myself. I'm still on fire...

      Had a great day today, though it started off a little tough. I got up this morning and went for a run. It was a beautiful day.. just an amazing display of the 'dog days of summer'. I desided on not doing HIIT and just went for a jog around the track at a steady pace. It was a nice change and a GREAT feeling workout. I think I averaged a 12 minute mile and sustained it the whole time, wich is a BIG improvement for me. BUT, when I finished and went to do a sprint to finish it off I felt a sharp pain in my quad. I went for as long as I could, but it was too painful to keep up. I limped my way home. Even after my shower my quad was hurting. It was actually hard as if I it was a cramping. I took some advil and was worried about the lower body workout I had planned.  We spent the day in San Francisco, walking ALL over the place. Aparently that was exactly what I needed because my leg started loosening up. I still wasn't sure about my lower body workout, but when I got home I desided I could at LEAST do my ab workout. Then I thought 'dead lifts can't hurt'... Once I had gone through all the trouble to drag out the weights I figured I may as well TRY squats. I desided on sumu (sp?) squats because I now that those tend to focus on the inside of the legs instead of the front of the quad where I was hurting. To my amazement I was able to do them!! I did a COMPLETE lower body workout!! I was SO proud of myself.  I'm sitting here doing the Happy Happy Joy Joy dance... I hardly even know myself, overcoming all this crap and getting my workouts done. Who IS this woman?? I kind of like her. :)

      I just HAD to bounce in here and actually put into words my two pieces of GREAT news.  1) Did my upper body workout tonight, while lifting weights I felt tired, and rather week, BUT when I did my pushups I did 5 That's right 5!!! pushups.. I'm 1/2 way there! Then, after resting a bit, I actually did 2 more. *grunting and doing my incredible hulk pose* muahahahah!  2) After showering I desided that it was time to check my BF% - The only way for me to do that is to get on my scale.. BUT.. the Body Fat part of it is a special program.. so I set it, got on, and closed my eyes when it displayed the weight. The last time I checked my BF% was on 9/29 and it was coming up 42.9%, this time.... 38.6% and that was without even adjusting my mesurments from last time! Considering I started measuring the end of July and I was at 50% or higher I'm SO stoked!!   Today was exactly what I needed to keep on pushing myself. Just that little kick in the pants.   I'll be taking pictures tomorrow, but it will be on film, so I'll have to have it developed... maybe I'll snap some webshots just to preview. I don't know that the changes will be that visiable on the outside, but at the moment, I don't really care!  Flying high and ready for the new week!!

      Still sore today. I can't believe how sore my abs ARE... Must be from doing crunches on the swiss ball.   Two victories today. 1) My knee high suede boots zipped up with MUCH less effort. 2) My suede skirt is loose. One thing I LOVE about leather is that it doesn't lie. When it fits.. it fits, when it doesn't.. it certainly isn't because it shrunk! Things are moving right along.   Will be an interesting weekend as my 15 year old is visiting. I'll have to take her out for a run with me. She plays water polo though, so I doubt I'm stronger, or in better shape then she is.

      I'm getting ready to hop into bed, so I think it's safe to call today GREEN. One thing - Sprints/Leg workout/HIIT Run on three consecutive days.. a sore body does make!! My quads, hams, gluts, and Obloquies, oh and abs are ALL sore! I'm just a bundle of pain from just above my navel.. down. Every time I move I find a new place that hurts, but I'm ok with that!   I'm still finding myself down. I'm not feeling as if I'm getting the same 'extraordinary results' as I did the first six weeks. And yet I KNOW I'm not slipping into ordinary measures. I think, perhaps, that my body is just changing in much more subtle ways. That's what I keep telling myself at least. Still, the question of weather or not I'm getting results has me evaluating every workout to make sure I really am honestly giving it my all. And I AM. I'm also finding the mirror to be a very frustrating tool. I can't seem to see past all the 'bad' areas. I look and I see all the progress yet to be made and I get frustrated and impatient. One thing it DOESN'T make me want to do is quit!!! I'm here for the long haul. However long that haul might be. Now that my first set of 'goal jeans' kind of fit, I've pulled out another pair. When those fit, I've got the next pair lined up, and when those fit.. umm well we're treading new ground.

      Still here, still fighting... The next few days should be interesting. Tomorrow is my fiance's birthday, and I've been busy buying presents, planning a small get together, etc. I actually have to get up EARLY tomorrow just to get my upper body workout in, ICK! Doesn't the time change sometime soon!?   As I've said before I have/had planter fasciitis in my feet. Last night, for the first time, I did SINGLE calf raises, and there was a NOTICABLE difference in the stability between my right and left leg. My right foot has been the one that's been giving me cronic pain (Though it's been TONS better since I've been excercising regularly). While doing calf raises it was evident that the supporting structure of my right foot is WAY behind my left. This, of course, only exasperates the plater fasciitis, as it's the rolling of my ankle inward and collapsing of my (surprisingly high) arches that causes it. So, now I'm wondering if there Are there excercises I can do to strenghten my ankles, and or foot? I imagine that the calf raises are a biggy, and I'll continue to do them singularly to make sure that I'm not over compensating for my 'bad' foot. I'm thinking that I should get some sort of step to do them on, so that I'm getting a full range of motion. Other then that, are there other things I could do? I have the stretches that the Dr recomended, and I take my anti infamitories, but these are designed to aliveiate the problem once it's occured, NOT prevent it in the first place (typical american medicine).

      I just finished my lower body workout. Boy was it a screemer! *Note to self - don't do sprints before a lower body workout*   I've been making a point to work through my frustrations of this morning. I was so temped to belay my fears of no progress by jumping on my scale this morning, but I kept hearing Marie's words in my head "I want you to learn to trust your hard work". That's the rub. You see, I DON'T trust my hard work. At least not yet!   I keep telling myself, "Look at how far you've come!". And then my evil alter ego (Perhaps relaited to compost man?) says "Yes, but look how far you have to go!" And yet I HAVE come far, in more then just weight. I scrolled through the blogs I posted my first week...  "Monday, July 28, 2003, 12:53 PM- I weighed in at 202.5 today. I can't stand the thought that I'm over 200 once again. I swore this wouldn't happen more then once. why do I constantly let meyself down? Why is it so hard for me to say "no". I need to figure out this mentality of mine. "  "Monday, July 28, 2003, 9:13 PM- Well, it looks like I made it through the day. I ate 6 small meals and stayed on plan. I wish I felt better about it, but at the moment I just feel hungry. I'm pretty sure I need to drink more water. Perhaps that's where my hunger is coming from. But, I did make it through the day. "  "Tuesday, July 29, 2003, 10:19 AM - It's morning - I made it through 1 entire day. 1 down 83 to go. I'm hoping that eventually I get a burst of energy, and some motivation and start to feel some HOPE. At the moment I just feel so let down. Everything I've tried has failed... I just don't want this to fail too."  I've come a long long way from "Just getting through the day"!   The results will come, they have to.. I'm not a girl who will take no for an answer!

      I haven't done much today so, not much to report, but I wanted to get an early update in here. I've been feeling a little cranky here. Feeling the withdrawl from my scale. I really think I'm going to need those progress pictures this weekend. The good news is, my daughter is going to be here, so I'll be able to get her to take them with a REAL camera. Of course that means that it will be a few days until I get them back. I'm anxious to see if I've made much progress in four weeks. I guess I'm MORE the anxious.. I NEED to see some progress. I have this feeling that things are going to get harder for a little while here. I've dropped a lot of fat, and lost a lot of inches. I still have a long way to go, but I suspect that the changes are going to be more subtle from here on out. And for a goal oriented person like myself. That could mean trouble. I need to reread my book on Mastery, I'll have to remember that there's pleasure in the platue, and that sometimes we have to regress a little in order to move forward.

      Yesterday I spent most of the day in bed. I wasn't feeling good. My stomach churned everytime I ate, I ached from head to toe, and I was completly wiped out and couldn't figure out why. It wasn't until late in the evening that I realized that TOM had come to visit! Normally I'm waiting for the booger, but I guess with the stress of testing... he just snuck up on me (and he was 4 days early too) The surprising thing is, and again I don't know if I was just so involved in studying that I didn't notice, but I didn't have a single day last week where I went.. "Hmmm.. PMS!" I'm hoping that the diet, excercise and suplimentation is making a difference. I know that I only had one 'depressed' day all last month, and for someone who used to spend a week in the dolldrums, that's a major accomplishment!  Today was an insane day at work.. one meeting after another, then my run, then shopping for my fiance's birthday, then dinner... etc.. so that it's 11:00pm and I'm just now getting a chance to stop in. The good news is that I'm GREEN! (Was yesterday too actuallyeven feeling like crap) Nutrition was spot on today!  I had a little hiccup on my run. As I said, I was in a hurry, tons of things to do, but my run was #1 priority. So, I changed as soon as I got home and rushed out, headed to the track. I was 1/2 way there when I realized that once again I had forgotten my watch! At first I thought I would do what I did last time... just count to 60 for each interval, but that was rather hard to do. Instead I thought, why not shake things up a bit... try something different... no one says I HAVE to do HIIT EVERY cardio session. So I continued my warm up walk and mapped out a workout plan. When I got to the track I started jogging when I got to the first bend... I continued to jog until I made it around the second corner.. then I sprinted the entire straightaway (over 100 yards).. I then jogged the corner and sprinted the next straight away... I did that 5 times. Then I jogged two corners (one straight away) and did one last 100+ yard sprint. It felt so cool to push myself like that... and amazingly I REALLY feel it in my quads, and the muscles in my waist just over my hips.. I don't think they are the obleacs (sp?) but maybe they are. I just know I feel it, and it feels good! I'm going to have to add that as a periodic.. shake up to my routine.. just like my 'long' bike rides every two weeks. helps to keep the body confused.. right?

      I had an excellent weekend! Of course Friday night was spent studying. Saturday, I woke up bright and early. I knew I was going to be in that test center for a good long while so I planned a special free day. Breakfast was cashews and a bowl of sliced apples rolled in protein powder and carob. I ate the nuts for the protein and fat. I needed to stay full a long time, and the apples for carbs and plenty of brain power. Of course I took all my vitamins too. And yes, I had my daily dose of caffeine. My fiancé was sweet enough to drive me to the test center since I had a nightmare the night before about getting lost on my way. There are few things that stress me out as much as driving to a place I’ve never been before. Taking a test is one of them! As you already heard, I passed the test. 4 hrs! It took them forever from the time I pressed the button until I got my results back.. during that time I swear I thought I was going to HURL! But it all came out alright… Now it’s on to the next step in my career.  To celebrate we went SHOPPING! Lol! We went to the outlet mall and I actually tried on and fit into a size 14 at ALL the ‘swanky’ shops. I tried on two new bikinis at nautical – size 12, and while the bottoms would have been feasible as a goal outfit.. the tops were a NO GO.. would have been borderline pornographic. I think I’m going to have to order a new suit online. Where I can purchase the top and bottom separately. THEN we went and had my celebratory meal. Chicago style pizza! I haven’t had that in over 9 weeks. It was as good as I expected.   Sunday we decided to go for a bike ride. It was a beautiful day here. Because we were going to ride on the streets my fiancé insisted that I get a helmet, and since REI was having a sale…BOY was that dangerous. They had a BUNCH of clearance stuff marked 50% off the LOWEST price. One of the things I got that I’m most excited about was a biking skort. It’s a pair of biking shorts, padding and all, (which I would never wear – I wouldn’t subject people to that sight) covered with a skirt. PERFECT for modest women like me. I tried them out and they are GREAT! Our bike ride was just wonderful. We biked across the Golden Gate bridge, and then through the presidio and marina district of San Francisco. The weather was fantastic, company great, and the workout PERFECT. My fiancé was surprised, pleased and proud at how well I kept up with him on the hills, and I was completely chuffed at my performance as well. Other then certain ‘bike specific’ spots, I’m not sore at all. We got home in time for my last Upper body workout, of the week, too. Oh! And I finally got another thing off my ‘wish list’ I got a yoga ball. It was an EXCELLENT way to do dumbbell presses, and I can’t wait to do crunches on it. It came with some exercise bands with special grips so you can attach them to your dumbbells. I thought that was cool, and an excellent way for me to add more resistance to my workout without having to buy more plates.

      apparently my sudy efforts of 6-8 hrs a night for the past week, pared with good nutrition and excercise (Had to get that in there) payed off! I passed, I'm certified!  I have an 'official' signature  Shawn Mueller PMP  Man that looks good.. 9 months it took to get that thing. Well longer really since it required at least 5 years of experiance. I'm off to celebrate!!!!!! I'm exausted, happy, stunned And.. who knows what else. I can tell you something though, if stress promotes fat... I gained 5 lbs today!

      I’ve been trying hard to describe the mood I’m in today and the only word that seems to fit is Euphoric. The funniest thing is that I really don’t know why! Inside it feels as if I’ve topped some hill after a long hard climb and found an enormous, green valley spread out below me. Yes, it will be a challenge to get down there, but the glimpses I’ve had of it are stirring, that there’s no way I can go through live without getting down there to see it closer.  In physical terms, my energy levels have shot through the roof! I’m alive in every since of the word. I feel my body and know it better and deeper then I ever have before.   I’ve found an interesting pastime while running. I imagine what my routine would be if I were to ever do a fitness routine. Understand that this is coming from someone who’s only been at the fringes of the sport. I’ve watched a competition on ESPN now and then, but never with an eye to understand what they were doing or why. I just have this vague recollection of the ‘former gymnast” winning. Still, I think it would be fun to start with something resembling a classical ballet. I took ballet for several years as a young girl and still remember most of my training. (I was 1 year from graduating to ‘point’) I have this vision of a woman (maybe me?) In the classic ballet pose called an “arabesque”’ One leg and one arm lifted, long, lean, graceful, and then curling that raised arm into a flexed bicep – fierce and strong. That’s my goal. That’s the vision I have for myself. That’s the woman I want to be… If not next year, then the year after that.   So, on to much less introspective topics. Today is Upper body day! Yay! Definitely my favorite workout. I think I’ll hit it as soon as I get home, then it back to the books to study study study. Tomorrow’s the big day!  I made an interesting discovery today. While doing my upper body workout last time, on several of my ‘second exercise of my fifth set’ I felt the weight I was using was ‘too much’ – each time it was using 10lbs of weight with 3.5 of collar for a total of 13.5lbs. So, I spotted my old ‘girl’ dumbbells (you know the fixed weight coated in pink plastic) and though “Oh, those are 10 lbs I use those! And I did. So today I was sitting there looking at those dumbbells, thinking about something else when it dawned on my that there wasn’t the number 10 stamped on the end.. it was the number 12! Not THAT different from the 13.5 I had thought was ‘too heavy’. And yet it seemed much lighter! It think I just proved to myself, once again, how much ‘perception’ makes a difference in a workout. Thinking I couldn’t do something, and I couldn’t... Thinking I could.. and POOF, I could. Our brain is an amazing thing. Maybe I need someone else to load my weights for me from now on! Heheheh.

      I got home tonight so exhausted! I had stayed up until 12:00am last night, first studying, and then rewarding myself for finishing all my reading with a workout. (Note the change in attitude – I’m working on that) This morning I was up at 5:45 because I had to be to work by 7:15 so that I could be at an all day, offsite meeting by 9:00am. I had grabbed a bar to eat on my way to work because I had expected bagels etc at the meeting. Boy was I bummed to find NOTHING! Luckily (though not the best choice) I had a balance bar in my purse (I always carry an emergency supply). This was a ‘working lunch’ and they had the regular ‘working lunch’ faire: Salad, sandwiches, fruit and cookies. Unfortunately, the salad had mayo based dressing on it (which I can’t eat) But, there were some greens on the sandwiches. I grabbed turkey on ‘whole wheat’ and some fruit. Needless to say I was STARVING when the meeting got over at 3:00pm. The only place nearby was Walgreen’s. I swear to you the ho-hos and Twinkies were calling my name. The only think I could find of any worth was another energy bar. By the time I got back to my office it was 4:30 and when I finally got home it was after 5:00pm. By then, my body was SCREEMING for REAL food! I quickly grabbed yogurt and some protein powder. After eating that I shuffled into my bedroom and changed into night clothes… I was SO tired! I sat down and started reading through the some blogs, BOOM, there was my friend Marie, talking about her 16 hour day yesterday, and how she still got her workout in. What could I do then but shut off the computer, change my clothes and go for my run? And I did! I know I say this every time but it was my best run EVER!!! I don’t know if it was the extra carbs in the stupid bars or what but I had more energy while I was zooming around the track then EVER. I was well into my third interval before it even occurred to me to think.. HEY, I’m into my third interval! It was amazing! After my fourth interval, I rounded the corner of the track, while I was walking through my active recovery phase, I was amazed at how quickly I got my breath back, so when I got around the corner I picked up my knees and tacked a sprint onto the end. I don’t know that I’ve ever ran faster, it was like I had wings! It wasn’t until I was on my home that I realized that I sprinted from Out of bounds line to out of bounds line on the football field, NOT from goal line to goal line, thus I had run 30(?) yards further then an 100 yard dash. I guess I won’t fret over that.   I came back feeling awake and alert, ready to face the 8 hours of studying I have ahead of me! I just can’t thank all of you enough for being here and for inspiring me to do things that I’ve never been able to achieve before!!

      I was thinking about something at lunch...  I realize how much of our attitude is based on our perseption of things. I also realized that typically when I get ready to do my workout for the day I will announce .. "I HAVE to workout.." or "I HAVE to go run..." While thinking about this today I realized that "HAVE" might not be the best choice of words. It hardly protrays an positive attitude or outlook. Well, unless it's in the contex that someone like Emma used it when she said "I HAVE GOT to workout or I'll go CRAZY". I assure you, when I say it, it's HARDLY in that context, and I've realized that I might need to change that. My body listens.. yes my workout is something I HAVE to do.. but I know I need to come into it with a much more positive attitude or it will get more and more difficult to motivate myself. Words are a powerful tool --  So, what do you say when it's time to work out? Is it a 'down in the mouth' I can't come out to play I HAVE to work out mentality? or is it... I've been waiting all day for this and I HAVE GOT to work out mentality? I Know I certainly could use some work in this area.

      October 1st. A part of me can hardly believe I'm here. I don't know that I've ever stayed this long on a diet and fitness program. Hmm.. that sounds sad. BUT, at this moment I don't feel the slightest urge to falter. I'm on a journey, one that has it's ups and downs, and yet one that I'll continue.  Day two of no scale. I still find myself eyeing it's spot on the bathroom floor, and feel the urge to drag it out of the closet and peek at how I'm doing. But that would defeat the purpose. I did take a look in the mirror this morning. The top of my tummy, High up, is definatly looking 'smoother'.  Yesterday, I had dressed up, skirt, hose, blouse and sweater. When I got to work I realized that I had a HUGE hole in my hose. Didn't really have the time or cash to replace them, so I went to the bathroom and took them off. I was thrilled to find that my tummy didn't ruin the line of my skirt like it would have just a few weeks ago. Another victory!!  Food for the day was good. I'm so busy in the evenings though that I'm not being able to plan my next day's meals very well. That means I'm having to rely on foods I know... Of course that also means.. BORING! I know I'm going to have to mix things up next week. Boring food leads to cheeting. Can't have that!  Had a GREAT run yesterday. I know I say that almost every time. I think it's because I always start out thinking it's going to be a terrible run, and yet, somehow it isn't! Best part is that my fiance went with me. It's always easier to face the track knowing I'm going to have a smiling face to look toward now and then. He was bummed because he couldn't keep up with me, but he hasn't run regularly in a while. Knowing him, (and the fact that his legs are MUCH longer then mine) He'll be lapping me again in no time. I'm learning not to mind.

      last night was poorly planned. I've had one of those weeks where everything I do seems to be jinxed. Things like, I open the freezer and something falls out, so I bend over to pick it up, in the meanwhile the freezer door moves and when I straiten I hit my head.. HARD! so I put the chicken back in the freezer and it dislodges something ELSE that falls out.... repeat I can't open something without it spilling, I can't cook without burning either the food or myself and on top of it all I keep forgetting and/or loosing things. So, I worked late last night, then on the way home I get on the phone with my mom (who I haven't talked to in months) and my battery starts to die. So I plug in the phone. Now I get home and I'm stuck inside the car because I can't unplug the phone, and I don't want to hang up because we're in the middle of an ernest talk. I finally sign off, and get inside. The kitchen is still a mess from the day before so I do the dishes, then start dinner. By this time it's after 7:00 pm! I finally get dinner taken care of and realize dinner dishes have taken over the kitchen and I have to clean it again! I start on my pies and figure out I'm out of ground ginger... so it's off to the store (it's now 10:00pm)... Then back home again. Finally get the pumpkin made and there is a CRASH in the bedroom - I hear Nigel making a commotion. We finally get the story.. the cat had been on the top bunk of the bed and had jumped off, missjudging her landing. She landed square on the swiss ball which by the law of physics went one direction while the cat went the other. Aparently she was so surprised that she didn't 'land on her feet' (she's still a kitten and not entirely coordinated) and was now refusing to put her weight on one hind foot. Now I'm seeing visions of a vet bill weeks before christmas! We quickly determined that nothing was broken but could see she was in obvious pain. She couldn't sit, or find a comforatable position to lay in. I finally got back to baking (this time burbon chocolate pecan pie) And when I go to find the pie crust I had stayed up until 1:00am the night before making I can't find it! I'm digging through the fridge and everytime I move one thing, something else falls out ... by this time I'm in TEARS and had to call in the calvery! My fiance' held onto me for a while, assured me again that the cat's ok and found my pie crust... I finished my pie got them both baked and watched the cat walking around putting weight on her foot again, although still limping... it was 1:00am and there was NO WAY my cardio was getting done!! So, yellow day BLEH!!!  By the way, I woke up this morning and was trying to find the cat. I finally looked in the last place I would expect her to be... in the top of the closet. And there she was, peering over the edge at me, curled up on top on of Nigel's t-shirts. Me thinks she'll be ok. She now shows some stiffness after laying around a while, and won't run on the foot, but walks without limping. Whew! She's a MUCH more cautious kitty today.  My Eats are on plan today. though I have NO idea how to get my workout in with company showing up at my house this afternoon. I may go in the bedroom and do a leg workout, hopefully it won't appear too rude. I'm not above taking time for me... even during the holidays. I did have ONE epithany today. I was mulling over my lack of progress this month when it finally hit me. I haven't been able to run this month! My cardio has been 'walking quickly' at lunch, some tae bo or sometimes just calastincs.... Since I've asked Santa for a Treadmill it will be interesting to see if that will move things along again (though the change in diet has had a postive effect)

      A few of the guys from work have desided to get into shape and one of them was asking me questions about BFL today. He tried it before but didn't totally understand it and I was explaining, and showing him some helpful websites. One of the other fellas (an older ex-military type) buts in and starts talking about a friend of his who did BFL and had GREAT results went from 2 hundred something to 175 in 12 weeks and is in just GREAT shape. (That part didn't bother me) Then he starts in on how if you follow the plan EXACTLY you can have great results too, but you have to follow it EXACTLY. (he stressed several times) THEN he turns to me and says. So, did you eat EXACTLY what he (bill phillips) told you to? Did you workout like he said? I was happy to say 'yes' on both counts but the implications chapped my hide. As if my results wern't good enough, and implying that I MUST have done SOMETHING wrong to not have seen the results he friend had. BAH! I wanted to punch the guy in the face. In fact, I almost pulled off my carnigan and flexed to get him to shut up! Luckily the first guy has heard my entire story and knows my results were good and was still willing to let me help.  Secondly...

      Well, I did it! Today I broke through the decade barrier. Weighed in at 179.5! Things are going to be interesting from now on in. I think I've said this before, but it bears repeating. I haven't been below 175 since I got pregnant with my oldest, and she'll be 16 soon. I've basically been this weight or heavier (and more likely then not, heavier) my entire adult life.  Calories are GREAT!  Yesterday's goals: Calories: 2043 P/C/F Ratio: 29/56/15 Yesterday's Totals: Calories: 1907 P/C/F Ratio: 29/56/15  I would call that GREEN.  Almost blew it BIG time this morning. I was rushing around getting ready for work and kicked the Foot Rest in the living room. This in itself would be a BAD thing, but MY Foot Rest is hollow inside and IN it, I store all my workout equipment. So, that made it WORSE. That puppy didn't budge an INCH. I heard a snap crackle and pop that WASN'T my cereal bowl! (Not that I eat cereal. but) I walked around a bit and everything seemed ok. It started getting sore on my way to work but I've walked around since and everything seems to work still. I may end up having some swelling, but I don't think it's going to impede my workout. I HOPE.  My upper body is WIPED from last night's workout. My chest is going to pain me for days! Trying to squeeze my arms together causes serious shakiness... Noodle chest? lol! I took a LONG soak in the shower to try to get some of the stiffness out of my shoulders but I'm feeling pretty good otherwise. errr more like GREAT otherwise. Energy levels are sky high, the sun is shining, life is good.  On a weird note, I got a bite of narcissism last night. After my workout and before getting into bed I spent some time in front of the mirror. Yes, I flexed. lol! I believe my biceps are actually starting to break the plane of my arm when I flex! lol. Chest still needs a LOT of work. Triceps are still pretty buried under fat, back; well I'm liking it, a LOT. I still think I look BIG... I'm trying to adjust my attitude, be patient and see what happens.

      Well it's 11:47. I managed to find 1,000,000 things to do tonight and my workout kept getting pushed back. But, it's done now! WOW did I punish myself! lol  I upped weights on the dumbbell press and it felt GREAT 17.5 (per dumbell) x 12 20 x 10 22.5 x 8 25 x 6 22.5 x 12 then when I went to do flyes I was thinking "I normally do these with my 12.5lb dumbells but I'm going to use my adjustable weights so I can go a little heavier" I remembered that the bar and collars weigh 3.5 lbs i figured I could put 10 lbs on it and it would be just a little heavier then my normal 12.5... (confused yet?) So I looked at 10 printed on the side of the weight and went.. "yeah, that's about right". It wasn't until I was at rep 6 that it finally clicked in my brain that there was a 10lb weight on EACH side of the dumbell and that added up to 20!! duh! It was punishment time! I managed all 12!!!! EVERY part of my upper body was shaking by the time I was finished with that set!  Onto back and I did bent rows... after a punshing chest workout what do I do? Up my weights here too!! 15 x 12 17.5 x 10 20 x 8 22.5 x 6 20 x 12  and bent flyes - this time I just used my 12 lb weights... I had already learned my lesson from earlier and I was still hurting...  12 x 12  Shoulders were pretty much uneventful - My shoulders are still piddly *** weak! lol Side laterals at PUNNY weights.. 2.5 x 12 5 x 10 7.5 x 8 10 x 6 7.5 x 12 Front raises - well I should drop the weight I guess - I did 12 and put EVERYTHING I had into them, but could only raise the weight about 1/4 of the way up.. 7.5 x 12  Briceps I'm still FIGHTING my left arm. I could probably go up on my right but my left really struggles. I'm glad I'm using dumbbells or it would be WAY too easy to cheet on these...  7.5 x 12 10 x 10 12.5 x 8 15 x 6 12.5 x 12 Hammer curls to finish things off and REALLY make me suffer... I actually whimper though these! 12 x 12  Triceps - workout's almost finished! My biceps burn.. shoulders are freid, my chest mucles are SHAKING... did kickbacks 10 x 12 again had a 'blond moment' and for some reason stuck 5 lbs on the dumbell instead of 2.5 which is my NORMAL increment - so I ended up upping the weights on tricpes TOO. 15x10 17.5 x 8 20 x 6 17.5 x 12 Then I did my FIRST set of dips. Granted it was a VERY low (step stool) 'bench' but I did 'em! 12 of them..  It feels SO good to be working out again.. though I hurt.. and I know I will continue to hurt tomorrow!  Got the cranberry sauce, cranberry chutney, and pie crusts made tonight... no taisting either.... diets on plan!!!

      It's Monday - time to train  The weekend went GREAT! It was nice and relaxing and I sat around and enjoyed the peace. For the first time in four months no part of me hurts. It's nice, but not a feeling I expect to last for long! upper body workout is planned for today and I can't wait to get to it! Upper body is always my favorite so it's a great way to get back into things. I can't wait to see how I do on the dumbbell press as I was ready to up the weights last workout and I'm always stronger on my first day back. This should be a FUN workout.  My weight has been 180 for DAYS, and that's GREAT! My average for the week was 180.8 lbs; the best EVER! I'm supposed to be upping my calories by 200 this week (to 2000). I see how that goes. So far my body's handled the extra CLEAN food well. I have TONS of energy and now I just need to start burning it. Add some more mass to my lean mass.  My fiance has grabbed ahold of this program and RAN with it. We've cleaned up his diet SO much. He's already starting to drop some fat off his abs in less then a week. We figured out that his biggest problem was NOT eating during the day. Probably why he was coming home at night exhausted. Before we moved he would go home at lunch and usually have a decent lunch (whatever was leftover from dinner the night before - and I tend to cook pretty clean) but now we live too far away and he was grabbing fast food or eating nothing at all. Then he'd get home and go straight for the ice cream and/or cookies. It's been so cool to watch him pick up on his bad habits and make the changes. For a man who knew NOTHING about food, micronutriants, and diet he's learned REALLY fast.  Of course I'm learning a lot too. keeping my sugars low and trying to add even more fibre into my diet. Not to mention more calories. Making sure to take my multi vits too.  I guess you could say I'm feeling fine and dandy today! Of course it helps that it's a short week and I'm entertaining over the Holiday. I LOVE cooking Thanksgiving dinner. I thrive on all the planning and prep work (sick I know). I made chocolate covered cherries last night from cherries that have been sitting in Brandy since last year. I even managed to keep my fingers out of my mouth... well except for the couple of times that accedently dipped my finger ALONG with the cherry and burned myself with the chocolate.  Ok, ok - I'll stop rattling on! I'm seriously thinking about starting my workout now.. cause I'm bouncing off the wall here!

      As I've said before my Fiance has started this new eating program with me, and he's using the same software that I'm using. Being a "professional dieter" myself I had assumed that EVERYONE knew what I knew about the content of food. Boy have I been surprised. My fiance' was/is pretty much CLUELESS about what he should eat when it came to micronutriants. It took me a little bit to figure out that he wasn't kidding when he came to me and said "I need to eat more carbs, what can I have?" The education process has been interesting for both of us and we spent a GREAT deal of time in the store last night with him reading the lables of foods and me explaining what it all meant. He's currently at 2208 calories P/C/F Ratio 23/62/15. Should be intersting!

      I've been keeping my calories UP... and, to my amazment.. as of this morning, weight is 180! OMG.. almost 170's and all the while eating ALL this food! lol Marie I'm sorry I didn't trust you completely before! Next week I up the calories another 200.. scarey and yet interesting...  In other news... after posting a few days ago that I haven't had a rest in over 15 weeks... when I went home Wednesday and felt totally, and COMPLETELY wiped out. ... I made a decision and I'm taking the rest of this week off from working out. The relief is INCREDABLE! and I can't wait to start again on Monday rested and renewed!  ---------  Ok - I just stepped away from my computer to chat with some of the 'guys' here at work... We were talking about "Rosie the Riveter" and one of the girls didn't know that was, so I struck the pose.... You've never seen so many geek guy's jaws drop.. That was fun. One even managed to stutter out.. "MAN you've got GREAT biceps do that again!" Muahahah! the POWER in being a woman with power ;)

      I'm still employed  Got back from my lunch... and while things didn't come out as good as I had hoped it WAS better then I had expected. I am NOW classified as Project Manager with a 'token' raise. Enough that it's going to help.... Not enough to keep me from a 'passive' job search. AND the fact that I was mad as HE|| about the pettiness they have been badgering me must have been apparent as the entire issue was sidestepped. Probably the worse part of the entire lunch was that he took me to this Greek restaurant. EVERYTHING was FULL of fat. I picked through what I ordered and ended up having to buy my own food later...  Now to decide 'next steps' I've pretty much decided that I need to get my bachelorâ€™s degree *sigh*, what a LONG process that's going to be! It used to be that a degree was not worth the money you put into it in the IT industry, now most jobs I see are wanting a degree, even if you have 12 years of experience. Our industry has changed I'm pretty sure that it's not for the worse, but I feel a little left behind. Now I have to catch up, and it's not going to be easy. BUT, I've taken control of my life recently in ways I never thought was possible. I'm finding I speak my mind more then ever, even when it may cause a conflict. I'm doing what needs to be done and I'm positive the last 12 weeks have had a LOT to do with it. I've realized that I'm capable of great things, and that even great things take small steps to make happen... And #1, sometime you have to live through a small set back in order to make great gains later. Yeah, I might have to stay with this job a while longer and accept the lower pay, but I KNOW I'll have the time it will take to truly commit to getting my degree. Once that happens, there will be no stopping me.  Ok, enough of my 'brain dump'.

      1800 Calories and counting ;)  Another day right on plan! I'm feeling really good! Planning an upper body workout tonight and I can't wait to get to it! I've got my fiance taking a REAL look at his eating and nutrition and it's been an eye opener for him. He can't believe how crappy his diet is, and he's always thought he was 1/2 way healthy. The PFA software has had a LOT to do with that. He has his own login now (he asked me for it) so that he can enter his own food in and check how he's doing during the day. I think he's been inspired by the fact that _I_ can wear his size 34 pants now, and he CAN"T. lol...  I have to say I was REALLY frustrated yesterday. I went to the store to pick up some new pants, and I picked out an assortment of 14's and 12's (OK so the 12's were more just for comparison) BUT the first 14's I put on were too small, the next too big... And so it continued. amazingly enough the best fit I found were a pair of size 12 jeans... YAY that they fit *sigh* that it was so difficult to find something. Men have no clue what it's like! lol My fiance walks into a store, picks up a pair of pants, checks the size and then takes them home - no problem.  In other news, I have a meeting with my boss today. It's the moment of truth either they begin to compinsate me fairly or I will have to get even MORE serious about my job search. I'm to the point that I'm ready to give them my resignation even without having a job to go to. They don't pay me enough to put up with the stress and BS that I put up with and the fact that they have recently started to ATTACK me to avoid giving me a raise has me ready to walk out the door. In most cases this would be no skin off an employers nose, BUT I'm a consultant, I'm revenue. When I walk out they loose the contract that I'm currently working on. Kind of nice to have a little clout in that regard.

      Ok, so first, I have to appoligize for my 'knee jerk' reaction earlier today. I was feeling SO bad from what I figure was 'carb overload'. I kept to my plan today - made it to 1825 calories - ratio 29/56/15 - EXACT! and, I did it without feeling crappy! yay! It helped that I found a GREAT dence energy bar at the store. Kept the calories up and the bulk down!  I also found a few tricks to make the program work better for me, AND introduced it to my fiance. Now it's a compitition to see who can get a better score each day.  I KILLED my legs today! I've gotten to the point that I'm trying to up my weights every time I work out my legs, really pushing them to the fullest. Tonight was the closest I have ever gotten to getting sick!! plie squats, jump squats, straight leg dead lifts, and split squats... I was wobbling after!!  The BEST news is that I may be getting a treadmill for Christmas!!! YAY! I've got it all picked out, just waiting for a little extra money to come our way.

      Iâ€™m done â€“ done with this current â€˜higher calâ€™ â€˜higher carbâ€™ phase. After four days of it Iâ€™m feeling sluggish, bloated and just YUCK! My tummy was constantly distended from the shear volume of food. It feels as if my entire body has gone soft, even my arms and shoulders, itâ€™s probably water retention, but it feels so GROSS! So today Iâ€™m back on BFL. Funny thing is, I think those few days at higher calories have done their job. After a breakfast that was twice what I would have â€˜normallyâ€™ ate, I was good and hungry 2 hours later. Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s a sign that my metabolism has hiked up a bit. I would love to see the scale start to fall again. Good news is, even with all the icky feeling the scale stayed pretty steady the past few days. I may have to try this experiment again. Perhaps will less carbs though. Bread doesnâ€™t seem to agree with me AT ALL!  Iâ€™ve also decided NOT to use the PFA (Personal Food Analyst). I found that with it I was spending several HOURS a day tweaking my plan so that I could almost EXACTLY match itâ€™s requirements. Yes, I want to be fit and healthy, but not at the expense of my family time. I will continue to monitor my input, but not to that level. Perhaps if my body was my JOBâ€¦ but Iâ€™m a computer geek :)  On a positive note, Iâ€™m wearing my first pair of â€˜hip huggerâ€™ slacks today. Iâ€™ve never been able to find a pair that â€˜fitâ€™ my body before. Iâ€™ve found that this is a VERY flattering style for me. With my â€˜top heavyâ€™ body and short waist I often felt like I looked like â€œMiss Piggyâ€? when I would tuck my blouses in. With these new slacks I look longer in the torso and my butt looks shorter! Both positive things! Donâ€™t get me wrong these are not â€œButt cleavageâ€? pants. But they are set about Â½ inch lower then my natural waist. Itâ€™s all good!  Time for lunch now!

      I have to admit, I have a new respect for those of you who have managed to up your calories into the 3000 range. Yesterday was a REAL struggle for me. Eating 1843 Calories, and eating CLEAN was a LOT harder then I thought it would be! AND MAN was that a LOT of food! WHEW! Still, I ate all that and didn't GAIN anything! yay!  I'm going to do it again today.  Finally got my shoulder feeling better, and I'm planning on an Uppder body workout. Did cardio again yesterday to stay green. Feeling REALLY good (though Full)  I'm going to fix some breakfast now!

      Quick check in this morning!  Things have been GREEN! Wednesday Night I did A cardio session with my man "Billy Blanks". My honey had bought my a new DVD to try. After the KILLER leg workout the day before it was MURDER! But, I made it!  Yesterday, I woke up and the saw the scale was STILL welded at 183. But I was feeling so lean and tight I pulled out the tape measure... waist down to 34!! woo hoo! that was my goal for this challenge! I managed to walk through a minefield of meetings still green. I passed over my upper body workout because I've got a pinch in my neck that's bothering me. I did a nice fast walk for some extra cardio instead. I think I'll be able to make up the upper body today no problem.  I've got another day of meetings, plus a work BBQ (we do these about once a month) But my day is planned and I should make it with no problem!  Siince my body is being so stuborn right now I'm going to try raising up my calories for a while and then dropping them again to see if I can get something started here. With the schedule I'm thinking of doing it will set me up to do some major fat burning after the first of the year - perfect for the BFL challenge. So, today my goal is:  Calories: 1843 P/C/F Ratio: 29/56/15

      Wow! I killed my legs last night. They are nice and sore today that's for sure. I changed up a few of my excercises and BOY can I feel it! I love it! My pants seems to get baggier every time I put them on, though the scale is staying pretty steady right now. I'm waiting with bated breath to finally see the 170's but not getting down about it. I just feel so good right now about the changes that I'm seeing that the scale is simply something I look at and note. Don't get me wrong, Seeing the scale go down is a TREMENDOUS thrill, but having it stay the same doesn't make or break me. I feel so strong lately! I upped the weights on most of my excercises last night and I felt as if I could have kept going! We'll see how it goes later this week when I do legs again ;)  Eats are right in line... staying within my ratios etc. Been doing pretty well in staving off hunger. I've been hitting the water a bit heaver lately too. Other wise... all is good! Still pushing the bariers for all I'm worth!

      What a beautiful day!!! Weather is grand! After days of rain we've gotten some blue skys along with some crisp tempatures. That along with the grape vinyards turning shades of purple and gold and it's a picture waiting to be painted.  I'm feeling so INTO my plan today. Feeling up, committed and on fire! I love days like this. Additionally, The more I look at my pictures the better I feel... AS I said before, things are happening, and I Love that!! I fit into my 'small' size 14 jeans today.

      Hello, I'm Shawn, and I'm fat... and yet today I choose to loose!  I took a plethera of pics today. At first I was pretty bummed out, but the more I took, the more postives I found. There are things going on UNDER that layer of fat. Things barely seen, and yet there are hints of them even on the surface. I've posted my favorites today, and I'll put a few more up over the next few days.  Other then that, not much to report. It was a rest day last night and I enjoyed it! Will be doing legs tonight, a workout I find I hate more and more. I'm going to have to find a cure for that if I want to continue on this path!

      Things have been busy here. Busy and challenging! But Iâ€™ve made it through another week! Four weeks to go.  I havenâ€™t been entirely happy with my stats, but then Iâ€™ve been trying to convince myself that that isnâ€™t entire what this is about. Itâ€™s about commitment and constancy, commitment not only to my diet and exercise, but to myself. I decided this morning that one of the ways I can improve my discipline is to start my day off with a positive, and that means getting up on time. I started today really well (and actually did better then normal last week too) and Iâ€™m planning to continue. There is something about making that initial effort of commitment that seems to set the tone for the entire day! Iâ€™m also still struggling with my water intake. Itâ€™s just another one of those places where my head knows what I should be doing. Iâ€™ve got all kinds of head knowledge and every excuse to drink more, and yet I still find myself â€˜forgettingâ€™ to drink my water my heart isnâ€™t into it. Iâ€™m going to work even harder at being better at that. The good news is that Iâ€™m taking my vitamins again, and feeling really good! Clothes are fitting better everyday, and while my results arenâ€™t â€˜stellarâ€™ there are resultsâ€¦  Weight down to 183 today from 194 (I still havenâ€™t gotten to my â€˜preâ€™-TOM weight *sigh* Body Fat from 43.7 to 38.6 So: Lean Mass up from 109 to 112 Fat Down from 85 to 70.5  Chest (Under Arms) From 38.75 â€“ 37.75 â€“1â€? Bust From 44.5 â€“ 42 â€“2.5â€? Ribs From 36 â€“ 35 â€“1â€? Waist From 36 â€“ 34.5 â€“1.5â€? Hips From 46.5 â€“ 44.75 â€“1.75â€? Butt From 44 â€“ 43 â€“1â€? Thigh From 25.5 â€“ 25 -.5â€?  I still have 4 weeks to make some changes and I plan on working my butt off to see them!  I think Iâ€™ll be able to take pictures tomorrow as I have to work until 7:00 and that means I can get in a little later.  My fiancÃ© has continued to work out with me, and heâ€™s doing GREAT. Weâ€™re having a lot of fun, and MAN is it nice having someone there to spot for me and help me with a few forced reps. And NOW weâ€™re having pushup contests!

      Rough Day Yesterday  I should have planned better, luckily everything worked out ok.  I had one of those late night meetings that I just HATE, From about 5:30 to 8:30. Why they schedule a meeting during dinner and then serve us "Heavy appitizers" is beyond me. Apparently "Heavy appitizers" means: Fruit, crackers and cheese, White bread and dip, veggies, chex mix, and fried chicken wings. At least last quarter they had grilled chicken on scewers! So, I ate some veggies and nibbled some of the rye bread out of the chex mix. I also passed up the free drinks! YAY! That was a big step for me... avoided the 'beer presure'. Felt MUCH better because of it too. Still made it through the day ON PLAN and green! yay!  Looks like I've lost almost all of the water weight from TOM.. scale is being pleasent again, so another boost for me. the 170's are back on the horizon. Planning a lower body workout for tonight. I wish I could get as enthusiastic about it as I do my other workouts, but I'm not THAT Masocistic.. YET.  Almost quit my job last night *sigh*. I wish I was secure enough to work for myself again. I hate this economy.  Other good news, I actually put on and zipped up a pair of size 12 jeans the other night. That was thrilling. Not to the point I could wear them in public, but zipping is a big step!!

      I got home early enough to go for a run tonight. It felt SO good. I think I pushed myself further then I ever have. It felt wierd running in a big baggy sweatshirt, but it was all I had. There were a lot of people at the track tonight, several teams practicing soccer, and a few people playing basketball at the courts. About my second time around I heard this loud voice yell "Run faster you F***ing B*tch... I kick your a**". I conviced myself that they wern't talking to me, after all why would they, but I have to confess that my first reaction was that they were. And yet, there was something missing from my reaction. It took me a moment or two to figure out, I didn't feel angry. It took me a bit longer to figure out why. The thing that was missing was guilt, guilt AND self loathing! There was no answering voice in my head saying "Yeah! Run faster!" For once I KNEW in my heart that I was doing what was right and good for ME and I felt GOOD about that. The rest of my run was a blur. The lightness in my heart transfered to a lightness in my feet... I came hope head held 20 feet high... I'm GOOD for me! ;)

      yesterday. I had a GREAT day. Was Mui Verde... Ate clean, and within my limits, and had an AWSOME Upper body workout. I went back to BFL syle workouts because... doot da doot...My fiance worked out with me! (I didn't think he would enjoy Dr Joyce as I had) I had him using the same weight I was and though he started off scoffing, he was feeling it by the end of each set. Then when I finished everything and gutted out 10 pushups... he did 5! muahahaha! My competative nature kicks in! Unfortunatly, I know him... and he'll surpass me within a week! Still he's a little sore this morning but not so much that he's ready to quit. A good sign, a REALLY good sign. I'm up and ready to go this morning. Feeling GREAT. I'm not sure what we're doing for cardio tonight, but we'll be doing it. (Ed - don't go there! lol!)  Need to get ready for work now!!

      Here are my goals for November:  1 - One free MEAL a week (I'm finding I need the 'cheats' less and less, therefore I think I'll plan a cheat MEAL and save myself the extra calories) 2 - Three weight training sessions per week. (I usually weight train Monday, Wednesday and Friday, but allow myself to shift those if there is a need.) 3 - Three cardio sessions per week. (This is not nessisarily HIIT, but SOME sort of cardio. Normally Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) 4 - Track nutrition daily (This is one place I've seen myself slipping. I've not been as good at inputting into fitday and therefore I'm left 'assuming' that I did ok.) 5 - 1300 - 1500 Calories/day 40% protien, 40% carbs, 20% fat 6 days per week(Again, I'm sure I've slipped a little here, based on my not always inputting my intake and having to guess) 6 - Take my vitamines daily (These are just as important to me as good nutrition, as I've discovered this month!! )  That's all I can think of for now....

      Sunday - Well didn't turn out as I had hoped. Woke up feeling worse then before and spent the day recovering. Eats were Green. Ate what I needed to, nothing more, nothing less. Too week and shakey to do much of anything. I went outside for a little while but it felt so cold and I ached so much afterwords that I had to soak in the shower relax enough to even lounge on the couch! Still, it gave me time to think and regroup. I took a break from BFL this past week. Loved Joyce and the face paced workout taped, BUT I miss lifting heavy! I already feel like the muscle I've worked so hard for in my upper body is starting to dwindle. :P I also feel like I need to tighten up my nutrition. While I havn't nessisarily been eataing BADLY I feel like I'm letting little things slip through, and while once in a while isn't bad, I don't want a little slip to turn into a terrible tumble. This is a dangerous time for me. I'm feeling good about the wieght I've lost and the progress I've made, it's too easy for me to relax and feel complaicent. I'm NOT going to let that happen. I want to stay on the edge. Push myself further then before... I want to set and reach goals I never thought possable, but to do that I've got to stay dillegent! November is going to be THE month for me. Made even better by the fact that my honey has declaired OUTLOUD that he is going to make a change AND asked me for help! I wouldn't feel right helping him if I didn't walk the walk myself. I actually got up early this morning and fixed him breakfast, lunch and snacks. We will be one FIT couple sliding into the new year!  Ok - got to get some work done

      didn't do cardio last night, I was just feeling too lousy. I ate green and then went to bed early! My fiance brought home a HUGE bag of candy I looked through it for a few seconds and then walked away, nothing tempting there. Made up the cardio today... Billy Blanks kicked my butt, but I kept up longer then last time. Sometimes I'm amazed at how quickly the body seems to adapt.  On tap for tomorrow:  a bike ride and upper body workout. Going to keep it nice and green!!

      I feel like I've made a step in the right direction.  I took a walk at lunchtime.  Almost sad that something so small is an accplishment for me right now, but it is.  Hopefully I've set the tone for the entire day.  (in a positive way).  I've been looking at some OLD pictures of myself and just shuddering at how far I had let myself go!  I know I will NEVER Get to that point again!  The only way I can do that is to continue to fight, struggle, scratch and claw my way toward my goals!

      Ever since I took that week off, I've struggled to get back into the excercise grooove. I keep slipping on my self promices...and even my promices to others and I hate myself for it. I've GOT to get my focus back before the 5th when I start my first 12 week challenge of the new year. I know I need to workout. I can feel the difference in my energy levels. Luckily, I've been reletively clean in the eating department and that's kept me losing. I'm just frustrated, and dissapointed...And fighting for all it's worth to get my 'groove' back.  It's easy to make excuses. "It's the holidays", "The colder weather makes me tired and want to hybernate" "I can't find a cardio that I like". But they are all just excuses. I know that the people who get it done.. just GET IT DONE. And that's not happening. It's time to take a hard line with myself and NOT let the tired lazy me talk myself into my old lifestyle. I'm NOT going to lose this battle. I can't, not this time. It's not in me to quit, but it's all to easy to let things slide.  Ah well, today's a new day and a new chance to make a differnce in ME.

      Well, this challenge has been colorful to say the least. BUT, I'm not letting this bother me or cause me to quit. I know that a few stumbles are not going to keep me from my goals. I'm so GLAD the holidays are over! My time is once again my own, and I'm not going to have to stare down mounds of sweets and chocolate every day at work. I did a great deal of 'snacking' over the past few days, but I don't think any MAJOR damage was done. Allowing myself a little leeway over the past few days also made TOM a little easier to get through too so in all it was a VERY happy holiday.  Today I am wearing a size 12 skirt that's been hanging in my closet for a year and a half! It feels and looks GREAT! I'm so excited about the changes ahead! And as I've said time and time again, I finally feel as if I really WILL reach my goals in the upcoming year.  My challenge for for Body Blog, and Body for Life start next monday. In the meanwhile, I'm going to spend this week reminding myself what it feels like to go hard EVERY day. On tap tonight, an Upper Body workout. Nutrition is set for 1550 calories. I'm still up in the air for cardio for the next few weeks as I don't have my Christmas Treadmill YET. Children's christmas presents came first, and we don't do credit. But it's in the works...  I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas and is looking forward to the New Year as much as I am!

      Somedays I really hate my body. Today is one of them. It usually happens when I have this 'vision' in my head of what I want to look like, and then I get dressed and what I see is NOTHING like what I have invisioned.  I was so excited about the sweater I got this weekend. I had the 'perfect' outfit in mind. Black turtleneck with my hip hugger slacks... I just knew I would be the ipidimy of 'sheek'. But instead when I checked the mirrow, my sweater didn't tuck correctly and instead of hugging and showing off my new slimmer waist it bulged and looked like I had a roll along the endge of the waist band. And then the 'bulk' of the sweater when tucked, added lumps under my slack in ALL the wrong places. So a day I had hoped to spend feeling stunning and successful I'm spending tugging, and tucking and grumpy. Oh well!  Did an upper body workout last night. I didn't 'kill' myself, after taking some advice that I might see more progress if I tried a different approach. So I'm trying. It was wierd to end a workout not feeling completely wrung out. Don't get me wrong, I was tired and sore, but not the 'Oh my, don't ask me to scratch my nose' tired and sore. Still, these couple of week are a good time for me to experiment and it was acutally a lot of fun to mix things up a bit.  I started with doing 15 half (girl) pushups to warm up. I had to laugh because earlier this year I could barely do 10 of these as a matter of fact I hurt my back strainging to do over 10. To throw out 15 as a WARM UP was really cool. Then I did 15 pushups with my knees on the swiss ball as a second warm up. What I had planned to do was super sets, but I couldn't figure out if, when doing super sets, if I should use the same weight on every exciercise so as to not have a pause. In order to accomidate no pause, no weight change - I took what was going to be a four excercise 'set' and broke it into 2 2 excercise sets. I figured 25lbs was a good weight for chest and back, whereas shoulders I wouldn't be able to do more then 15lbs. What I didn't factor in was how HARD doing 15 reps would be. SHEESH! By then I was so into my new workout I completely forgot that I was going to do pull first and THEN push.. duh! I switch them up next time! So I loaded 25 lbs on the dumbbells and started to do chest press. I couldn't figure out why it felt so HARD... Then I recalculated and realized that I had loaded 30 lbs on each dumbell. With visions of Nicole pushing 50lb dumbells, I went ahead and pushed out 6 reps at 30 lbs. Was pretty cool! then I REALLY got 25lbs loaded and after a rest I did my fifteen chest presses and without a rest did 15 bent rows. a short rest and I tried to do the next set of 15. HA! ended up dropping the weight do 20 to finish. WHEW. Then 15 bent rows no problem. My back is MUCH stronger then my chest it seems. Second 'super' set I did military press 15 reps, and thanks to Jeremy managed to use excercise bands and Jurry rig a lat pull down. I think I might need a few sturdier bands though because even with three bands strapped on, it was a little easy. I would have liked a little more of a burn. Even so, my mid back is a little sore today. Feels good! Second set of 15 reps was pretty much the same. THEN.. just because I was feeling good and wanted to fool around a little I did a handstand for about 30 seconds. I think that's why my shoulders are a little sore today in a new place. Eventually (years from now, I'm sure) I want to do handstand pushups. Just to say I can!  Nutrition is going well. Eating out at lunch today, but I've got it all planned. They wheeled out another batch of sweets today.. a CART LOAD, but I've passed it all by. Not worth it.  Happy Holiday's all!

      Bad News--I'm still struggling with my workouts.  I just can't seem to find the time and/or get my priorities in the correct order to fit in everything.  BUT, I'm pushing through.  Good news-- My weight today 177!  It almost hasn't sunk in!  I've been below 180 for 7 days now!  Average weight for last week 178.6... lowest EVER.    My clothes are fitting GREAT, in fact I'm actually starting to finally get to the point where I go.. Hmm this might be consitered too big!  As a matter of fact while shopping at Eddie Bower this weekend I had to get a sweater in a size Medium!  Makes me want to leave the "M" sticker on the outside of it when I wear it around! lol    The sweets are still pouring in here at work.  another package of candy, although this one contained some nuts so I could have a few.   Nutrition goals for this week - 1750 calories P/C/F ratio 41/29/30  Bring on the Salad and meat! :)  I'm planning to doing an upper body workout tonight.  I will up the weight on a few excercises and see how I do.   We had a GREAT weekend.  Took a trip to the city and saw the Nutcracker.  It was GREAT, and I managed to things nutitionally balanced.  I'm furiously working on finishing up my shopping.  I found out this weekend that ALL three of my children are planning to come over at christmas, when I first thought it was just going to be the youngest.  While I've managed to buy my oldest a few gifts my son has been a problem.  His list has consited of things like.. a PS2 or a computer... not something I can afford right now.  I'll have to see what happens.  I'm going to make it through this holiday in the black financially, and out of the black ... clothes.  NOTHING is going to keep me away from that 175 mark!

      Iâ€™ve been at my current weight four other times in my adult life. Once - I was 19 and had just had my first baby. I was NOT happy about it then, but somehow with working full time, taking care a new husband, and taking care of a new baby, I didn't have time to pay attention. After my second child was born I was even MORE horrified to find I was now 207. I joined WW and within a few months I was down to 177. I was fitting into size 14 and sometimes a 12, It's was easy to feel good. I started to look around and realize ... "I've average!". And average feelt pretty darn good after spending so much time morbidly obese. But, that 'happy to be average' feeling is dangerous! This was the first time I dealt with the.. "I'm happy to be average" syndrome. Men were paying attention to me more then ANY other point in my life. I was happy, I was strong, I was ... having marital troubles and dealing with a husband who didn't appreciate the changes that I had made. So I ignored myself again... let it slide; said "I'm happy with average" only to find myself after my third child weighing 230 lbs. (or more) This time the weight loss was slow. I didn't have a specific program that I followed or a support group, I just did what 'felt' right at the time. I got to 180 and hung in there. This time when the husband started his 'crap' Instead of ignoring myself I ignored him! Needless to say, a divorce ensued and I found myself 177ish, single and once again "happy to be average". This time I hung on a bit longer, and caught it sooner when my weight started to creep back up. I had found a man who loved me, nurtured me and made me happy and when my weight got into the high 180's I quickly started ediets and once again, I got into the 177 range, size 14/12 and very comfortably 'average'. I quit making progress, and soon I had quit. Then came surgery and an unexplained weight gain... once AGAIN I was on the wrong side of 200 (203) and I finally decided.. "This is for life!" I've taken control and I've fought my way BACK to below 180 and comfortable in a size 14 pair of jeans...  This is why I continue to set goals, why I try not to let my 'success' side track me. Why I'm not saying "It's the holiday's have a piece of chocolate"... I want better then 'average' for me and for those around me. I don't settle for 'average' in anything else I do... not love, not my job, not life... why should I settle in my health and appearance?  Yes, we should enjoy our progress, be happy with how far we've come... but realize the journey isn't finished. If fact it never SHOULD be finished!  I guess I just need to put this down... more for myself then anything. To make concrete in my mind why I sit and eat my salad while everyone around me wolfs down See's Candy...

      I thought I would record my current workout as it was one of the goals of this 4 weeks was to increase the weight I was using :)  Lower Body - (weight is total number of plates) Plie' squat 35 x 12 40 x 10 45 x 8 50 x 6 45 x 12 Jump Squat 0 x 12  Straight Leg Deadlift 40 x 12 45 x 10 50 x 8 55 x 6 50 x 12 Split Squat 50 x 12  Single Standing Calf Raise 25 x 12 30 x 10 35 x 8 40 x 6 35 x 12 Front Calf Stretch Heavy&Light Band x 12  Crunches 12 10 8 6 12 Reverse Crunches 12  Upper Body (Weight is total plates for single dumbell) Dumbell Press 20 x 12 22.5 x 10 25 x 8 27.5 x 6 25 x 12 Flye 20 x 12  Bent Row 17.5 x 12 20 x 10 22.5 x 8 25 x 6 22.5 x 12 Bent Flyes 12.5 x 12  Military Press (/ indicates dropping 2.5 lbs) 12.5 x 12 15 x 10 17.5 x 8 20 x 4/2 17.5 6/6 Lat Raises 7.5 x 12  Bicep Curl 10 x 12 12.5 x 10 15 x 5/3 17.5 x 5 15 x 3/8 Hammer Curl 10 x 12  Triceps Dips (MAN these HURT!!) 12 10 8 6 12 Overhead extentions 30 x 12  Pushups 10  Whew!  Now, to work on the drop set excercises, until I don't have to 'drop' them anymore AND raise the rest of the excercises UP Until I'm having to do drop sets for them too.  I realize this is HARDLY 'pure' BFL style, but I think it's important for me right now to try pushing my limits a little and teach myself what 'true' failure is on every body part. I've had FAR too many excercises in which I say "Hmm.. I think that was all I could do...." enough of that!

      Everything seems to be firing on all cylenders right now. It's feels so great to be back in a groove and seeing results! I Killed my upper body on my workout last night. Raised weights on everything, did drop sets to finish and generally left myself feeling like a wet noodle. It was all good though when I woke up to see a very nice thing on the scale. SOMETHING appears to be working! at LAST!

      Ouch, Owe, Owie.... it's so bad I have to say it in three languages! lol! My legs and lower back hurt YES, but so does my arms and shoulders... just goes to prove that squats really DO utilize nearly every part of your body.  Nutrition was PERFECT yesterday. BUT, after all my momentem yesterday, LIFE happened and my workout was not to be. BUT I have 1 rest day per week and it WILL be made up. Upper Body is planned for tonight and I cannot WAIT. my favorite workout by FAR. I'm going to add weight to each of these excercises as well even it means I have to do some drop sets. Cory has challenged me ;) Nutrition today .. well LIFE also caused me to not be able to plan ahead today. I grabbed clean eats, but I doubt I've eaten ENOUGH yet. But I'll be able to adjust later. I'm nothing if not flexable.

      Slow day at work - Been looking over my stats. The more I look, the more excited I'm getting. Yes, I've been here (under 180) a couple time in the past few months, but each time it was the week before TOM and it SHOT back up right after. This time, I'm NOT going to let that happen. FOCUS is my battle cry! :)  Stat wise I've gone NO WHERE since the end of October. It would be easy to consider the past month or so a waste of time, but but internally I've learned SO much that I wouldn't trade the past month for ANYTHING.  I'm going to do some circuit training for cardio tonight and see how I like it. Light Light weights and calistenics.

      Well! I'm sore. I knew I would be, but, it's not as bad as I would have thought. I'm going to take some ibprofine and things should be fine. Amazingly the most sore part of me is my back. I'm going to keep a close eye on that because I don't want or need to strain anything there. I'll watch my form a little closer next time I do deadlifts.  The best part of the morning was seeing the scale at 179.5 ... Yes, it's been here before, but I think this time it's going to continue to drop... NO Backsliding! I feel so confident right now that there should be NO PROBLEM. I still don't have a real plan for cardio tonight, but we'll see what we can work out.  Breakfast is done and I'm off to work, not by 9:00 but I'll be there by 10:00 wich is a darn site better then 11:00 lol!

      That workout was EXACTLY what I needed!! I'm feeling 100% more energetic now, I've got my meals planned for tomorrow and my lunches packed. Tomorrow should be the same as today, right on PLAN. Cravings are under control... or more like GONE. I really wonder if it wasn't caused by me forgetting my multi-vit for a day or two. I'm looking forward to a really positive week!  Tomorrow is cardio day and I've got to figure out what to do there. without runninig to look forward to I'm really struggling to find something I like and is challenging. I tell you what, I wish I had a heart monitor on while I was doing legs today. I KNOW the blood was pumping!

      Finally!  I worked out!! Yes yes yes! Killed my legs, I will be paying for it tomorrow! Itâ€™s a darn good thing I have a sit down job. Upped every exercise by 5 lbs too! Whew! Iâ€™m going to keep adding until I hit my limit. Going to see how far these legs will go! I know Iâ€™m pretty close to my limit on upper body, but Iâ€™m going to push it there too. Iâ€™m hoping the heavier weight will add to the fat burning factor. At least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m telling myself ;)  It feels SO good to back on plan with both exercise and food. I can already feel the mental lift! Itâ€™s so GREAT to be keeping my self promises. There is also the fact that I fell down and managed to pick myself up! I didnâ€™t quit I didnâ€™t say â€œForget it, Iâ€™ll wait until next yearâ€? I got back on and did it NOW! This year! I WILL reach my birthday goal. Iâ€™m going to smash through that 175 barrier and get set for the new me in 2004!

      My scale is going wanky! :P So I'm either at 181, or 179.5, or 177.5! lol! The fact that the other day it said 189, then 184, then 183 makes me think that there is something wrong with it. I HATE changing scales, but it may be time for a new one. (though I would LOVE to think I'm at 177.5 and only 3 lbs from my goal)  Yesterday was another challenge... but I made it through. I found out that my daughter had a music concert! I managed to adjust my nutrition (I couldn't go home, my kids live 2 hours away) but missed another workout! NOT a good start to a challenge...  Still I'm keeping my head up and my hopes! Even if I'm at the highest of the weights today (181) that's 2 lbs gone for the week, so I've reached my goal there!  Doing what I can here and not beating myself up over the rest. It was tempting today to throw the nutrition out the window. With not being able to go home and eat the rest of my meals I wanted to just start in at lunchtime eating whatever I wanted... but I didn't, I ate what I had brought with me and got a sensable dinner later at Carls (BBQ Chicken Sandwiches PLANE are awsome - a nice REAL chicken breast, roasted, on whole wheat bun) An energy bar for meal 6 and I was set. Good thing I packed my four other meals! Still rolling strong and aiming for Jan 4th!

      I ended up sleeping most of the evening last night, I only woke up to eat! And I managed to keep it clean! It was amazing! At one point I stood in the kitchen with an ice cream bar in my hand and actually had it OPEN. All the 'normal' justifications run through my head. I'm sick, I'm not going to get all my food in anyway, I'll start tomorrow.... you know how it goes. Then I thought ... "Today I choose to lose!" I wrapped the bar back up, put it in the fridge and fixed some boiled chicken. (a great thing for a sensative stomach)  So, yes, I got all my calories in and kept it clean! I didn't workout but tonight it's deffinatly on the ajenda.  I'm really looking forward to what the next four weeks will bring.

      If I chose to only look at my stats, the past 12 weeks could easily seem like a failure. After all, of six major goals, I only reached two of them. Not a good percentage, and yet, in my mind, this challenge was an unequivocal success, if, for no other reason then that I finished. As with any journey, there were rough spots. This one started out that way. Half way through my first BFL challenge, I was struggling to realize my capacity for change. Now I know the skyâ€™s the limit.  I began afraid, afraid of letting myself down, of letting others down and of failing, yet again. I was afraid I wasnâ€™t doing enough, or perhaps that I was doing too much. I was afraid of bulking up, afraid of not losing enough, afraid of tripping, stumbling and never getting up again. I did stumble. I tripped, I fell in the mud I even slogged through it a time or two, but I never stopped. Because somehow, somewhere along the way I realized that the only way to lose the battle was to quit. I also learned that sometimes you step into quicksand, and you fight and you battle, and you just make things worse. Then you have to relax for a little while, float up to the surface, take stock of the situation and then move on. Thereâ€™s a time for pushing and there is a time for resting.  Now the challenge is over and Iâ€™ve taken a step back to look over my results, and I truly am amazed. I look at the progress Iâ€™ve made and I think, â€œIs that really me? Did I really do that?â€? There is a part of me that is proud, and yet another that is humbled because I didnâ€™t do it alone. Without the love and support of my friends and family, both online and at home, I wouldnâ€™t have made it. Itâ€™s because of you all that Iâ€™m finally starting to see the woman Iâ€™m going to be. And, Iâ€™m not afraid anymore.

      I really struggled with what my goals were going to be for the next four weeks. Having just came off 18 weeks I thought that perhaps I would coast these 4 weeks and set the stage for a January Challenge. then I realized that the prospect of not losing for 4 weeks (on purpose) was just TOO disheartening, so........ I am going to KICK BUTT for four weeks and set my most lofty goals yet... My birthday present to myself is to the lowest weight of my adult life. Less then 175 for my 35th!  Of course nature had to throw a wrench into the deal...I had my day all planned, food ready to go I was all psyced for a GREAT workout tonight, and what do I do? I started feeling ill 1/2 way through the day. Went home sick and I've been in bed ever since! Funny thing is, it hasn't depressed me as much as I would have thought (though it's made it hard to think and to write a decent essay to end the blast).  Watch out! I've got a goal, people, and I'm not going to let ANYTHING get in my way! :) I'm SO excited. Today's pictures really helped and I'm really excited about seeing what's to come. I really truely feel as though I CAN do this!

      I've been struggling with focus of late. The colors on my calander make that obvious :) I think I figured out part of my problem. I've been setting goals, thinking ahead, looking forward and toward the days to come and actually starting to BELIEVE I can reach those goals. All good things, but I've been forgetting to also live in the moment. To wake up and each and every day choose to loose THAT day. I need to create a sign to put up, somewhere in my house that reads "today I choose to lose". Because THAT's the choice that I need to make each time I faced with a decision. Do I have those cookies - or do I choose to lose? Do I skip my workout - or do I choose to lose? Although my ultimate goals are a long way off, it's the choices I make DAILY that are going to make those goals happen. If I don't choose to focus on what I can do today, 2004 is going to end up like every other year... October, November, December will roll around and I'll still be fighting the same 50 lbs! To tell you the truth I'm SO looking forward to the days when I can be fighting those last subborn 5 lbs!  I'm starting to worry that at 2200 calories I'm hitting my metobolic limit, though I realize that after the week I had last week I need to give my body some time to settle. My problem is I don't know myself well enough I feel as if I can rightly judge what's happening. It may be my imagination but I feel as if I'm filling my clothes out a little more, and I DON'T like that. I'm giving it some time (no knee jerk reations here). Going to give my body the chance to burn off the turkey fest! It's also TOM so THAT could be adding to these feelings.  I know I haven't been very positive or uplifting of late (or at least I don't feel that way) but I have to be honest both with you and myself. I need to get to the bottom of what's going on here so I can move on and move up (down?). Even if I could manage to lose 2 lbs a week (something that's not happened yet) starting today, it would be the end of May before I would hit my goal of 130. That's a lot of months of making choices and staying on track. Don't get me wrong, I KNOW this can happen and I know I'm capable of doing it, but it's going to take more work then I'm used to doing, and it's going to mean making sacrifices now and then. It's going to mean learning a lot about myself... maybe even things I don't like all that much. But I find out exactly what I'm made of!  While we're finishing the Body Blog Blast I feel that sense of accomplishment and yet that urgency that there is so much more to do. It's like preparing for a long journey. You pack, you plan you pile everything into the car and yet set off. Yes you ARE on your way and that's a good thing, but there is a lot of road ahead of you. That's the way I feel, I've packed the car, I'm on the road. Now I have to deside if I'm going to drive as fast as I can toward my destination, go through the night and perhaps arrive exhausted. Or, I could take the scenic route, see the sights explore side streets.... Then there's the danger of getting hopelessly lost and never arriving! Lately I've been on one of those side streets....

      I'm plowing through this holiday season. Weight is still comming down from the "holiday splurge" and I'm back to 181! YAY (was 185 day after Thanksgiving) Still eating a TON of clean food. Nigel and I are BOTH ready to hit the excercise HARD it's going to be a fun 4 weeks until the new year!  I brought the chocolate covered cherries into work and am letting the folks here finish them off. That was an easy one as I don't like cherries but it's nice to get it out of my house. Pantry is getting low though, and I definatly need to restock on the basics. With both of us (and sometimes three of us) eating 'clean' I'm finding we go through food like MAD! I've set a few goals for the next four weeks, and am thinking of more. I found an old journal from Jan 2002 and on the 3rd I was 181. Jan 3rd 2003 185! My goal is to make progress THIS year and come in somewhere in the 170's this January. (Even 179 will be good as I'm adding and NOT cutting calories the next few weeks)  Mentally I'm feeling strong ready to hit it. My confidence is sky high... I KNOW I can do this and that's almost a forigne concept for me. This is going to MY year!

      I'm back at it, back on track and planning to kick some butt this week. Calories are up another 200 to 2200. My weight is getting back down to pre-thanksgiving/PMS levels! Yay!  Next week I'll start a 4 week sprint to the new year! 2004 is the last year "loosing wieght" is going to be on my new years resolution list.  I learned a lot this weekend. I learned that I have a lot of demons still hanging out there waiting to lead me astray. Unlike Marie I did not find the will to eat "a little of this or that" and leave it at that. And unfortunatly instead of Thanksgiving being a free day to enjoy good food and good company. I ate so much I was ILL! BAD! AQnd then it spilled over into OTHER days...I also let my old habit of putting others first come into play and instead of taking the time out to do what I needed and excercise, I sat around and had another handfull of 'cheesy poofs'! A sure way to make my thighs continue to LOOK like cheesy poofs! BUT, I'm not dwelling on what whouldda couldda shouldda been! Instead I'll take the opportunity to LEARN and figure out a plan to get through the rest of the holidays! I need to keep the 'sugar hangover' feeling fresh in my mind and as Brock once said, "play the tape through', get past the instent gratification that comes from a piece of pumpkin pie and think instead of my long term plans and goals. (Actually it wasn't the one piece of pie that did me in, but the second and third!) I think I'm going to have to forgo my 'normal' holiday tradition and STAY OUT OF THE KITCHEN! For some reason I have a real problem resiting my own cooking! Either that or I'll have to make sure I only bake things that I don't like! lol! (the chocolate covered brandied cherries haven't phased me once! ) I already took the step of getting this weekend's 'baked goods' out of the house (sent all the sugar cookies and leftover cranberry bread home with the kids) Maybe one day I'll be strong enough to have that stuff around the house and not have the constent urge to put it in my mouth, but it's not happening today! The good news is - we don't do a big dinner for Christmas, so I don't have THAT to live through. Just three company Christmas parties. I've already ordered chicken for dinner at one of them and I'll leave the room when they serve desert! lol. One of the others is a 'pot luck' so I'll bring food I can eat... the other maybe I can skip it! lol  I'm still asking Santa for a treadmill for Christmas and hoping he'll bring it early so I can start getting my 'regular' cardio in. The weights are ready to go... I'm going to start thinking of my goals for the next 4 weeks, probably more strength goals than anything as I'll not start cutting until the after the first of the year.

      The holiday week picked me up, shook me, threw me down and then stomped on me! Then TOM came along and did the same leaving me red and yellow! ick! But I've one more week to go on this challenge and it's going to be a GREEN one! There will be NO looking back. What matters is what happens THIS week!

      Yesterday was green - No really obsticals no big hurtles just forward progress and I like it. I kept my commitment to do SOMETHING every day by doing some pilates. It felt really good to stretch and workout in such control. I felt really long and lean afterwords. On that vein, one of the things I DON'T like about not weighing and using the 'pant-o-meter' is my ability to convince myself that I'm not 'really' seeing the progress that I'm having. I'm pretty sure my slacks have been looser of late. Even the brand new 'small' size 14's that I just bought. Since I put them on after JUST washing them and was seeing some baggyness in new places I'm pretty sure that something is going on. I'll take measurements and pictures this weekend and know 'for sure'. Today should be clean - has been so far, though I wasn't as well prepared as I would like. Still I managed to grab a healthy bar, banana, and whole wheat pitas stuffed with chicken... it should tide me over until I can get home. Mood is up, progress is tentative, but green is green!

      Another part of this book just lept off the page and bit me on the nose, so I had to share it!  "...I recommend that you should not even try to eat a perfect diet. Perfectionism is just a form of rigidity. It's simply compulsive "not eating," and it's usually replaced with compulsive eating after it become too unpleasant. Your real goal should be to overcome compulsiveness of any kind. To overcome compulsiveness, don't try to be perfect -- try to be good. Over the long run, good beats perfect every time" (The False Fat Diet Elson M. Haas, M.D.)

      It's too early to say I'm in the groove, but I'm certainly a LOT happier then I was before! Yesterday was GREAT despite a few potential setbacks. First of all, I had all day meetings - always a challenge. I got up and had some scrambled egg whites and then took a banana strawberry shake with me. By the time my first meeting started the shake was gone, and I was able to pass up the bagels and danishes that abounded. I got some time off for lunch so I had my prepared chicken patty - unfortuantly right after I finished eating I was invited out to lunch with a bunch of people to send off a coworker who was leaving. I went but sipped my diet soda and nibbled on nann while everyone else wolfed down some awsome smelling idian food.  My last meeting was over at 3:00 so I headed for home - it was a BEAUTIFUL day, and I quickly changed into running clothes and I was on the track by 5:00! What a GREAT feeling to run again! I've lost a step or two but really got in a GREAT workout and I'm not at all worried about the drop in my mile time. The track was really soft due to all the rain we've been getting so my foot is completely pain free both last night and today. My legs WERE KILLING me last night (My bum was so sore from my leg workout) but it was worth it. I spent the rest of the night a MILE high.  My meals today are planned and my lunches packed. I'm expecting another GREAT day.

      YES! a great day today. Not only were the eats clean, but I did my lower body workout, planned all my meals for tomorrow, and breakfast and lunch are prepared and sitting in the fridge ready to be consumed! I love days like this!  I only got in one set of legs but MAN did I kill myself. I have a feeling I'll be feeling it for several days after! 60 lbs supper sets. Plie squat, dead lift, squat, split squat... 15 reps NO REST! I was panting and on the verge of puking by the end. My legs are still trembling as we speak!! My shoulders and hands got quite a workout too, just holding those weights for so long.  My current goal is to do SOME sort of workout every day. I think cardio's going to be out of the question tomorrow so I'll either do upper body or pilates.  I have meetings all day tomorrow so I probably won't be able to check in until the end of the day, but you can bet I'll do my best to make tomorrow a healthy day too!

      I started reading a book called "The False Fat Diet" and came across a GREAT quote that I had to share..  "If you strive for thin, you'll never win. Strive for health and thin will follow".  It so closely matches what Jeremy talked to me about last week that I have a feeling I'm supposed to be hearing this! Just like when three DIFFERENT people told me to back away from the scale.  By the way "The False Fat Diet" talks about food alergies and should be an interesting read.

      After the THIRD person (and the last being someone _I'm_ supposed to be mentoring) said "get off the scale" I'm going to do it. I actually desided to NOT get on the scale for a few weeks over the weekend... and then in my morning fog stepped on the scale this morning - duh!  Just to clear things up a bit - I DO know that I have to trust in my own hard work. The thing is, I KNOW I haven't been 100% - I suppose I use the scale, and the lack of progress that shows as a punishment. Sick and twisted I know. There was something else I realized while talking to my VGF Cory...  Feel free to skip this deep emotional insite if you wish! lol  You see, for years, basically 175 has been my goal... The ultimate measure of success.. Why? Well 175 represents every diet I ever failed. It represents 12+ years waisted in a distructive relationship. It represents a childhood lost to having babies and keeping house.  It shouldsn't but it does. and I don't know how to change that. No, being 175 won't make me 18 again. It won't give me back the self esteem that was eroded every time I 'got close' but didn't make it. It won't heal the scars from 12 years of abuse... logically I know this, but somehow in my heart I feel as if 175 is some sort of symble... a sign that I HAVE made it, that I have healed, matured and that I HAVE overcome.  I hate facing a problem that I don't have the answer to. This is one of them, but just because I don't have the answer doesn't mean that I can't keep moving, keep planning and keep doing good things for myself... And I'm going to step away from the scale... Overcoming - maturing and healing is so much more then a number on the scale. I know this - and I'm going to focus on that until my heart believes what my head knows....  Emotional Rant over!  So - I've been eating clean - Yesterday I needed to recover, mentally and emotionally so I have myself a day off - but today I WILL train. I'm going to keep FIRM in my mind how good it feels to workout, how strong and powerful it feels... Not to mention the great things it does for my body. My body responds well to excercise, so I need to take advantage of it.  One other thing I realized over the weekend is how much I REALLY miss running... That meditation time.. That time to focus on goals and think postive thoughts, always happened while I was running. I can't do that while trying to follow Billy Blanks on TV and I really can't do it while lifting wieights... When I'm running my body does what needs to be done and my mind is free. I need that.  Ok - that's probably enough blathering for me!

      Wed didn't go as planned, and Thursday had no plan, so I'm left with a colorful calendar once again. But - My time to refocus is getting shorter and shorter.  This morning when I got on the scale and it said 182 and 42% body fat I decided ENOUGH!!!! I've wasted enough of my time, enough of my LIFE! I'm taking back control and making canges in my life.  Now to decide HOW. Well, I started the Discover Channel Diet, and I REALLY like it! It's so simple I just click a button and I have a menu and a shopping list. Sunday will be 'free' in the sense that I'm not going to 'plan' a menu, but I'm going to keep it in reason.  Exercise has been the most inconsistent part of my program. I want to RUN! Every other form of cardio I find every excus in the book to put off. So I'm going to do a 3 on and 1 off weight program for a bit. Just Something everyday to get the body moving and the blood pumping.  I did have a little talk with Jeremy, and I realized that more then anything what needs to change is me. There is obviously something INSIDE of me that's brining on these laps... I need to focus and I need to stop letting myself down. I'm worth the time it takes to plan and fix nutritious meals. No, wait - the FUTURE me is worth it! I'm worth the effort it takes to push out a few reps with the weights... I want to be strong and healthy... I want to be a role model. Heck, I'll admit it, I even want to be admired!  As I've said before, visualization is a real problem for me, so I'm going to take the time to do a little artwork and put my head on the body I want. I'm adding pilates back into my program so that I can spend that time thinking the body that's sitting there, waiting for me to take posession of it. I want to ingrain that image in my head, I want to see it when I look in the mirror and in my dreams. And - I'm starting all of this TODAY - I'm not going put this off until Monday. Today is the day to take action! If I put it off until Monday I know what I'll do, I'll take a three day break and be back to 185! No more back sliding! I WILL get below 175. I've had ENOUGH!

      Things are going smoothly. Feeling much more in control of myself and still strong. Work has been really busy wich is a good thing, but leaves me little time to properly journal and/or keep up with all that goes on here. But I'm trying!  Lower body workout planned for the day and I think I'll superset it as I"ve done my upper body. I'm enjoying the fast and intense workout.  Eats are clean so far today and I'm planning on some nice black bean and rice burritos for dinner tonight.

      Just a little Funny that brightened up my day!  Losing weight is the number New Year's Resolution. The problem is, hardly anything works. Well, I found this one diet that will absolutely shed the pounds. Read it and see if you don't agree, it works for my two-year-old.  Miracle Toddler Diet! Guaranteed Results!!!  People are always on the lookout for a new diet. The trouble with most diets is that you don't get enough to eat (the starvation diet), you don't get enough variation (the liquid diet) or you go broke (the all-meat diet). Consequently, people tend to cheat on their diets, or quit after 3 days. Well, now there's the new Toddler Miracle Diet. Over the years you may have noticed that most two-year-olds are trim. Now the formula to their success is available to all in this new diet. You may want to consult your doctor before embarking on this diet, otherwise, you may be seeing him afterwards. Good Luck !!!

      Yesterday felt like the first day that I wasn't fighting myself every step of the way. Today is good as well. I'm not feeling sky high, but I'm feeling strong. It's very different, but I like it. The best part of today is that I'm wearing my first pair of size 12 slacks.  I feel bad that I've been so up and down here. A real roller coaster ride - I appoligize for dragging you all through it - but believe me, what was going on here was MUCH worse then what made it to these pages.  Today's Menu  poached eggs with toast Blueberry breakfast bar (oats, egg whites and blueberries) Chicken Salad (This was planned but my work took me out for lunch - I had chicken, dry pasta and veggies) Tuna Snack (Tuna, oats and yogurt) Stirfried chicken w/snow peas  The work continues...

      Ready for the new week - ready to get my head, heart and body inline and start to make some PROGRESS here! Nigel started the fat burning phase of his diet today and THAT has REALLY pushed me along. Last week I was just so SICK of food! So I took a few days and while I'm sure I didn't do all that badly, I didn't plan or track ANYTHING so I can't give myself green for those days.  I stopped by to see an old friend on Saturday. I had sent her the pictures of my daughter's formal and she was THRILLED to get them, and then mentioned that she haddn't seen the kids in about two years! So I bundled the girls in the car after my son's game (he didn't want to go with me - I'm getting the cold shoulder from him again) and drove them over to see her. She's an AMAZING woman who cares deeply about the people in her life. I sat and talked to her for several hours and was thrilled at how ALIVE and Bubbly she seemed. Finally I got her to stop talking long enough to ask her "So, how are YOU!?" She took a deep breath and with a smile said, "I'm really not doing well. I can't walk anymore, not even to go shopping, or through the neighborhood to visit with the neighbors. My hands stiffen up all the time." She laughed and showed me her middle finger, "especially this one. I get embaraced because I'll be talking and waving my hands and there's my middle finger poking out there, as though I'm being rude. I can't even make the number three. My hair is always a mess because I can't lift my arm, because of my shoulder, BUT (and this was the important part) I keep smiling. There are a lot of people in the world who are a lot worse off then I am. I have a loving family and friends, I make sure to thank God for what he's given me, and I'm content." You see, this lovely, bubbly lady has lupus. Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys. The body's immune system normally makes proteins called antibodies to protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign materials. These foreign materials are called antigens. In an autoimmune disorder such as lupus, the immune system loses its ability to tell the difference between foreign substances (antigens) and its own cells and tissues. The immune system then makes antibodies directed against "self." These antibodies, called "auto-antibodies," react with the "self" antigens to form immune complexes. The immune complexes build up in the tissues and can cause inflammation, injury to tissues, and pain. In my freind's case, her Lupus is severe and it continually attacks the joints in her body, so that at 60 she can barely hobble across the room. And yet, this lady wakes up every morning and thanks God for her blessings. Who am I to complain about cravings in the face of this? How can I skip a workout when I know she's at home, right now, wishing she could just leave her house and walk around her block?  This experiance, combined with a coming across a menu generator that I'm VERY pleased with Has me reved up, ready to go! It generates the menus for me, balances them and prints out the recipies, all I have to do is fix it and eat! No more obsessing over food for me - a really nice break.  Today's menu Apricot w/yogurt, protein powder, walnuts and oatmeal Chocolate protein yogurt w/walnuts Cucumber pita w/boiled egg whites and grapes Peanut Butter Shake Greek Pasta Salad  Workout - upper body weights.

      I'm green for yesterday. But frustrated. I know, I probably shouldn't be but I am! I'm at 180 this morning, and while in the shower I practically had a panick attack. I realized that I've been within 5 lbs (both over and under) 180 since October 23rd! This is obvously a 'set point' for my body as I maintained this weight for about three years before my apendex surgery without dieting or maintaining any serious excercise routine. So, I had this moment of panick - what If I can't get below this? I know that was unreasonable and irrational but it really struck me. You see, I feel a little like an analigy in a book I was looking over yesterday (Get Rich Slow - thanks Jeremy) I feel like a fly, who keeps throwing itself against the window trying to get outside, and just yards away there's an open door! Believe me... I keep looking for that door, but instead I keep finding another window to beat myself against! BUT - in truth I don't think I can REALLY say that I've hit the window until I've committed 100%. Maybe I haven't been strict enough in my diet. I know I havn't been 100% consitent in my workout. Perhaps to break through I'm going to have to be a LOT more consitent then I had to be to actually get to this point. I don't know. The thing is, I feel like I really need to NAIL a program before I say it isn't working. I'm not sure I've really NAILED the BFL program in the past two weeks. I think what's frustrating is I didn't HAVE to NAIL the program before now to still see results. So here's to even GREENER days my friends!

      I'm back for certain! The sun is shining today and I feel GREAT. Eats are clean and on plan. I've got an upper body workout planned and I'm actually looking forward to it! Still waiting for the scale to catch up with my mind, but hey I'm willing to be patient.

      I did it!  I did it! I did it!  Not only did I crank out a killer lower body  workout today, but I made up my missed cardio as well... AND my nutrition  has been right on track!    I'm back BABY! And I'm going to burn some fat!  By the first  of Feburary I WILL be under 175 and at the lowest weight of my adult life!  :)   I'm pretty sure I finanlly started dropping some water weight today.  My  body usually dumps a BUNCH of weight the week before TOM and this is it, so,  I'm going to push for all I'm worth and drop as much as I can because the  week after the scale won't budge!  I'm ready for it though!    Oh, YES!  it's feels so good to have the fire back!

      My mood has risen steadily today. Aided, in part, I believe, by an early morning leg workout that, frankly, ROCKED! I'm sticking to clean eats today and have plans to do some cardio tonight (the leg workout was a 'make up day') I've realized that to HAVE a transformation I have to THINK of this as a transformation. No more thinking "Well it's going to take me MONTHS to get to my goal, so what difference will one skipped workout make?" I had lost sight of my favorite saying "You can't expect extraordianry results from taking ordinary measures." My measures have been even less then ordinary for the most part the past few months and I HAVE to break that habit. Otherwise, I'm going to continue to see less then ordinary results... Or in my case, NO results. This IS a transformation. I think my transformation before kind of startled me. In the back of my mind there was this little voice that kept saying you only get one like that, it's slow and steady from now on. But that's NOT TRUE! there is no reason I can't continue to transform my body. Why I can't continue to have dramatic results for the next twelve weeks, and the twelve weeks after that, and so on and so on... I don't have to wait a year, or six months, or even three. I can see changes in three weeks if I put my mind to it. And I shall!

      I struggled. MAN did I struggle. I fought for my life last night I finally managed to pull myself out of the mud and mire and get back on track. But just barely. I had one of those nights when I argued with myself for about 1/2 an hour about excercising (plus I was having major cravings) Normally when I deside to workout everything is golden after that, but last night I fought myself the ENTIRE time. It sucked! But I did it! I finished green and I'm better for it. Even if I didn't enjoy it.  Tonight the plan is to do a lower body workout. I think I've finally recovered from last week's lower body workout. It felt easy when I was doing it, and early the next morning I felt fine, but later! wow!!  Nutrition is on track for the day, though I need to sit down tonight and do a menu for the rest of the week and make sure the cupboard is stocked. I have to admit I'm not 'on fire' at the moment. I'm just doing what needs to be done and waiting for the motivation to strike again. What's important is that I keep the ball rolling through the 'non-motivation' period. Then when motivation strikes again, I'll have made progress and will have that fuel to add to the fire.

      I feel SO good today. Three green days in a row! Not only is my mood sky high, but I'm feeling REALLY thin today. Yeah, the scale is being stuborn, but I'm listening to the advice of someone near and dear to me (yes that's you Marie) and holding onto the idea of trusting in my own hard work! As for feeling thin - my work slacks are REALLY starting to get baggy. I may end up buying some new ones soon, but I'm hoping to hold out until I'm in a size 10. (Which is one of my goals at the end of this challenge.)  Water wasn't as good yesterday, but better then a 'typical' day for me. I'm still feeling swollen and hoping that it's just my body being stuborn. I'll keep dosing it with water and hope it get the idea that I'm not going to dehydrate it again. Yeah, Jeremy, I'll keep in mind that it will do things in it's own time, not mine! I have a few more weeks before I'll seriously worry about it.  Eats were clean yesterday, even with my Working dinner. They brought in subway sandwiches, and I managed to scronge for something to fit into my plan. Luckily, they had ordered some turkey on wheat bread. It had mayo and other 'crap' on it, but I scraped that off. One of my coworkers chuckled as I sat there dumping stuff off a second sandwich but I figure, a few months from now _I_ will have the last laugh.  Unfortunatly, starting at 6:30am and not getting home until 9:30pm left me WIPED OUT. So, I made the executive decision to post pone my lower body workout until today. As I said before this acutally works out nicely as it will push my cardio to tomorrow, and I'll be able to run outside (barring rain) the LBWO I have planned should TOAST my legs... I'm almost dreading the DOMS already, but at the same time, look forward to it! EIther way I plan to PUSH myself for all I can.  Obviously I haven't started my Spirit Mapping yet. From the time I got home until I went to sleep I was planning today's nutrition and review goals, so indepth jornalling is still on hold. I am having a LOT of fun encoraging a few other ladies on thier journey and I'm finding the challenge of being someone else's support is doing a LOT to keep the fire going and to push me to stick to my plan.  Probably the only struggle I'm currently waging is my ever present need to see results NOW. It's only been a few days! but I'm looking for week four results already. I'm not letting it eat me up though. I keep reminding myself that I'm doing the right thing and if I continue to do the right thing good things will HAVE to happen.

      Two days in a row, MAN that feels good! Today, I'm working on three. A PB for this year ;) I have to admit that I'm going for a 'Marie like' year this year. I know that's setting my sites high, but why not aim high?  I had a cardio session with Billy Blanks last night. Not my first choice for cardio, but until Santa brings my tredmill, it's all I've got. I'll be so glad when it starts staying light longer and I can get back to running outside again. Last night, after I laced up my running shoes I had the most OVERWELLMING urge to RUN! It was SO frustrating to be locked in the house, but there was no way I was going out when it was 45 degrees outside and PITCH black. Needless to day, punching the air with Billy did a lot to vent my frustrations. I really PUSHED myself and even got a cramp in my side at one point. It felt great! :)  Eating has been clean, but I'm still retaining water. I feel a little crappy in that regard with a tummy ache and swollen fingers, but I expect it will cycle itself sooner or laiter. My guess is, dropping the cafein might have something to do with it, after all, I've been ODing on a diaretic for so long that my body is hording water in case I deside to do it again. I expect a flush soon, as I've been dosing myself with pleanty of water over the next few days. I have No soda at home so it's pure water for me from 5:00pm on and that's made a major difference. Plus I'm drinking 32 oz AT LEAST at work at my desk.  I still haven't had time to start my Sprit mapping. I spent some cuddle time with my sweetie last night in time, which is more important as any journal could ever be. It sometimes amazes me that after almost three years together the flame is brighter now then it was when we were 'supposively' in the 'honeymoon' stage. We watched a really AWFULL movie last night (Shallow Hal), and while I was leaving for work this morning he hugged me close and said "I'm so lucky! I have a woman who's beautiful on the inside AND the outside, that way I can be Shallow!" He's such a sweet goofie man!  Plans today are in place, and I've got my lunches with me. I have a dinner meeting tonight at work, but I'm brining a bar with me in case the food sucks (and it often does). I had to be into work early (along with working late) So, although, I've planned an upper body workout for tonight, I've left myself the option of doing it tomorrow without penalty. Sometimes you have to adapt. Besides, if I have my 'rest' day today, I can do cardio on Saturday and that means I can run outside! Hmmm this is sounding like more a blessing then a problem...

      Yesterday was Green - No problem there. I had to adjust my nutrion a little as I hadn't gone shopping yet but it was all CLEAN eats. Today looks like more of the same, with a cardio session scheduled for later. I'm feeling better today then I have in a LONG while. I've been drinking a LOT more water and I'm sure that's made a difference. Still haven't cut the caffien, but I haven't REALLY made the commitment to do that. I quit for several hours on jan 1st but I felt SO crappy that I caved and started in again. BUT I've cut WAY back and may be able to eliminate it entirely before too long. That is IF I decide at that point that it's entirely nessisary. I don't really feel as if I HAVE to give up soda entirely, I just don't want to be DEPENDENT on it.  I haven't really started my spirit mapping journal yet. Last night's shopping took up a lot of time, so by the time I had done that, fixed dinner, cleaned up, excercised and planned prepared for today, it was time for bed! I also didn't get up as early as I had wanted... BUT I did get up earlier then usual and made it to work 'on time' so I'm proud of my progress. I've also made it my 'job' to bug a few people at work who have expressed an interest in getting in shape. As I said to Cory, knowing I'm going to be asking someone "Did you work out?" make it that much more vital to me that _I_ workout! I've also restarted a daily email support system with a friend, and have been approached by someone who saw my profile on the body for life tracker webpage, and asked for email support. Once again I'm surrounding myself with people who support and encorage me and I can feel myself growing from all the positive energy. This challenge and the susequent transformation is going to be AMAZING, I can feel it! :)

      I went out for some 'retail theropy' at lunch today.  I thought I would 'challenge' myself and my goal to be a size 10 by the end of this challenge.  BOY was I surprised when I took some size 10's into the dressing room and I could button AND zip them.  A few could have even been worn in mixed company!  so, there is NO doubt in my mind that size 10 is dueable in 12 weeks.  It might even be selling myself short... but it's something to shoot for, that's for sure.

      Well, today is really my 'New Years Day'. This is when all my resolutions take effect.  I had a nice LONG weekend. Enjoyed the New Year, and my birthday and now it's time to get to work!  I've already promised myself that I will be unrecognizable by the end of this challenge, and I'm SO excited about the changes that will be happening. I've done a few things that should help things along, and a LOT of thinking and planning over the weekend.  1) I bought the BFL Journal. I've enjoyed the whole proccess so far and I think this will help keep me focused. 2) I've desided to do a pure BFL style challenge. I really debated over this, and due to the fact that I still have a lot to lose, and a few more challenges before I'll have to worry about 'fine tuning' and losing that last few Body Fat percentages, I've reasoned that it's easier for me, both mentally and physically to do BFL 'by the book' for the next 12 weeks. 3) I bought a jornalling book. As everyone is aware the inner transformation is just as important as the outer, and there is no doubt in my mind that my inner transformation is still in process. I bought this amazing book called "Mapping your Soul" and a journal to answer the questions posted in it. I'm hoping this will bring me even closer to knowing myself and feeling comfortable in my own skin.   I've planned my menues for this week already and have my grochery list written out. Oh, and in case you didn't notice - I've done my pictures. I feel things have backslid a little recently, but I've no regrets over how I spent my holidays. Now it's time to focus... and I've no reasons, no excuses NOT to have one terrific day after another!

      My baby is 16 today.  Her Dad is taking her and her date out to dinner tonight before the dance and as a surprise I've been invited along with her grandparents, and several of her friends from school.  I'm bringing her 16 roses and some baloons.  Her 'real' present will be a bit later.  She and I are going to spend the weekend at a spa along the ocean getting facials, mud baths, massages, and riding horses.  But we want to let the weather clear up a bit to go.  In other news all is going well with me.  Another clean day eating though I've had to push trough a few cravings last night and today.  There is little so hard on me as walking through the grochery store some days.  Today was one of them as I wanted ever single sugar/carb loaded thing I walked past.  I bought almonds and left.  Tonight should be a challenge as the birthday dinner is at olive garden.  I've already had to talk myself out of a big plate of pasta.  I WILL be eating chicken tonight!  I've been below 180 for two days now, I will NOT sabitague myself!  There is NO excuse worth seeing the scale go back up.  Not at this point.    Tomorrow we're going to the Winchester Mystery House.  For those who don't know this is the house built by the Winchester Heiress.  She believed that the spirits of those killed by her husbands rifles were haunting her and as long as construction was going on at her house it would keep them at bay.  She had people working on her house EVERY day from  1884 - September 5, 1922.  That's 38 years!  Part of the home was destroyed by an earthquake and rebuilt, so it's actually smaller then it could have been.    Number of rooms: 160  Cost: $5,500,000  Number of stories: prior to 1906 Earthquake - 7; presently 4  Number of acres: originally 161.919; presently 4  Number of basements: 2  Number of windows: frames 1,257, approx. 10,000  Number of doors: doorways 467 approx., 950 doors not including cabinet doors.  Number of fireplaces: 47 (gas, wood, or coal burning)  Number of chimneys: presently 17 with evidence of 2 others  Number of bedrooms: approx. 40  Number of kitchens: 5 or 6  Number of staircases: 40, total of stair steps - 367  Number of skylights: approx. 52  Number of gallons of paint required to paint entire home: over 20,000  Number of ballrooms: 2 (1 nearly complete and 1 under construction)  Blueprints available: No, Mrs. Winchester never had a master set of blueprints, but did sketch out individual rooms on paper and even tablecloths!  The most interesting part is that though the house was built in the victorian era it has  modern heating and sewer systems, gas lights that operated by pressing a button, and three working elevators.  As to why it's a 'Mystery House'.  It also boasts a stairway to 'nowhere'  a seance room and other such 'oddities'.  Truely a cool place to visit if you are ever in the bay area.  We're also planning to hike the dipsea trail this weekend for a 'trial' run.  We'll walk it of course!    Also  Andrew  I wasn't the one bragging - Nigle and his coworkers were, I'm just along for the ride!  Alrighty then - I think that's all for me!  Have a great weekend everyone

      I forgot to add that not one but TWO different people mentioned that I was looking good and commented on my weight loss.  Talk about a boost!   One was my neighbor who I happen to see about once a month.  He said "You're still losing weight arn't you?"  when I said I was trying he said "Well you are looking really good".  *ping*  Then one of the ladies at work said she liked my outfit today and then said "You're looking good that outfit shows off your weight loss".  *ping* again.    I wish you all could hear the conversation going on here at work concerning the poisening of america through our food.  I'm just trying to keep my head low...

      Another great day on plan, and my weight is still dropping - 179.5 today!  My cravings have been little to none, and that's ALWAYS a boost.  I did find an EXCELLENT and easy sweet treat... made with Ricotta cheese!  Who would have thought.  I was sceptical at first, but after one bite I realized that this was a snack for me... Basically you need .5 cup of Ricotta cheese and a packet of splenda - after that it's up to you. some suggestions:  .25 tsp lemon zest and .25 tsp vanilla extract or .25 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp slivered toasted almonds or simply .25 tsp vanilla extract or .5 tsp unsweetened cocoa .25 tsp vanilla and a dash of espresso powder, or .25 lime zest and .25 tsp vanilla extract.  My guess is that you could add just about ANY extract to it (I have coconut at home and may try that with some ccocoa powder tonight)... It's creamy sweet and reminds me slightly of cheese cake... one of my favorites.    Lunch yesterday ended up not being a challenge at all.  I desided to skip the pizza place and got to Fresh Choice (That's a salad bar chain for those of you who arn't familure with it)  I knew there I could have a much better selection and a greater supply of protien.  SO... Lettuce, greens, spinach along with chicken, soybeans, eggs, bacon bits, cheese, sunflower seads, olvie oil, garbonzo beans (my 'special treat to myself) and black olives... all went into one of the best salads I've had in a LONG time... I skipped the bread even though it was included and the pasta, pizza and potato bars... amazingly the salad was satisfying all on it's own and I ate almost all of it... something I don't normally do.  I did make sure that I had a LARGE variety of favors on it though and I think that helped a lot.  Dinner last night was another 'new' meal for me.  I had bought sirloin steak and though I love steak, I'm the WORSE at preparing it, plus I didn't have time to let it marinate overnight... So a little searching on the reynalds wrap website and I found a recipe... I sliced the steak, threw some low sugar tariki sause on it along with ginger, sasami oil and garlic powder threw it and some apareagus on some aluminum foil, wrapped it up and threw it in the oven for about 20 minutes.  That and some brown rice and dinner was SERVED.  I made enough that I have leftovers for lunch even!  I am feeling SO much better about things now.  Food is easy again and I like it that way.    No, I'm not currently exercising.  I want to get through this week ON plan.  Focusing on making my food goals.  Next week I'm going to start to hit things once again.  I'm hoping that I'll have enough extra money from this check that I'll have the down payment for my treadmill - YAY!  I don't know how long it will take to ship but my hope is that week after next it will be here.  In the meanwhile I may just do something simple like calastenics and/or walking for my cardio.  My fiance and I have a physical challenge coming up that's lit the excercise fire in both of us.  It seems one of his coworkers was complaining about the hike she went on last weekend.  Of course the 'brag session' started and that lead to a challenge being layed down.  We are all going to do the hike next march so we have some time to 'train' for it.  It'll be fun.    Overall I would have to say my mood and outlook are improving once again.  I've actually taken a few steps toward starting my own business once again.  A 'temporary' webpage is up I just need to reload FrontPage on my home computer so I can upload the 'upgraded' temporary webpage.  That one will probably stay there awhile until we can totally redesign.  My fiance wants to write our webpage and has ALL these ideas but I know what his time is like and so I'm not going to hold up everything for the 'new and improved' website.  We need to sit down tonight and set goals for our first 'cutomers'  I'm thinking we might be able to have everything in place in June, or maybe even May... I want to have things established enough that we will be in full swing by winter.  There I've said it!  Ok - I think I should get some work done

      Yesterday was 100% nutrition wise again. My clothes are back to feeling baggy and I'm feeling TONS better. Actually feeling that small little germ of hope again. My head always knows that change is possible, but sometimes my heart doesn't believe it. For now the entirity of ME seems to be in the same place and that's a relief.  Work has calmed down a little today.  Part of my goal in journaling was so that when I was finished, someone could look at it and be encoraged. I never expected it to be 'easy'. I think if someone else reads the things I go through and realizes that even though life and even your own body throws you curveballs, and you DON'T GIVE UP... you will, eventually, reach your goals then I've achieve something. I think there are few things more discoraging to someone on a journey then to look up at someone at the top of the mountain and have them say... "This was easy, I don't know why you are struggling so". When I make it I want people to know that it wasn't easy and yet I did it anyway... If that makes any sense at all. In a way, it's a little like christianity... Though I hate struggling I know it makes me stronger and I should be thankful for it... I learn valuable lessons every time.  anyway - I'm off to grab a salad going to get a salad bar at the pizza place - pray for me! *grin*

      Well I'm still here. Still fighting but actually winning more then losing once again. After a BAD weekend I was up to 184! but I knew most of it was water weight and sure enough, it's all gone today. I've tasked myself with being strict until I can BREAK this 178-181 yoyo I'm on... NO MORE free days until I've broken the 175 mark. I'm getting closer and closer to getting my treadmill and I have to say I absolutly CAN'T wait! we've moved furniture around and have a spot reserved for it so I'm hoping that SOON very SOON I will be running in the comfort of my own home. then I'll have no more excuses :)  Food has been 100% for two days...  Work has been HORRIBLY stressful...

      Oddly enough, feeling better  So yesterday afternoon I drew a line in the sand, and said to myself .."Self, why are you doing this? Why wait for tomorrow to get back on track? Does it really matter that I cannot get a 'green' today? NO! I can still make my next meal the best it can be, and the next after that and the next after that... " So, I did!  To try and stem a little of this yo-yoing... I cut all carbs except for veggies (and I'm eating LOADS of those) This is usually a really easy way for me to put a crunch on the cravings monster.  Ironically enough, last night I started feeling REALLY crappy physically just as my mental angst started to lift. Still, I've managed to make postive choices today despite TOM's sledgehammer-like arrival. I picked up a bottle aleve and now I'm feeling as good physcially as I am mentally. Better, but not out of the woods. One thing that hit me like a brick between the eyes this morning as that, once again, I've allowed my suplimentation to slide. My body has made it obvious that Calicium and B6 is essential to combate my PMS symtoms, and yet, for some reason, when I started stuggling this month the fact that I had fallen behind seemed to slip my mind. I carry both in my purse vitamin caddy so I've taken some today and I'll do continue to do so EVERY day!  Alright - going to keep focusing on, one meal at a time... plod through the next few days. It's not about feeling it, it's about doing it. And I will! (I got the 'Yoda' pep talk today can you tell?)  a few shouts before I get back to work...

      My meals are planned, and I actually should have a pretty stressfree day. for the first time in about two years I'm not under the pressure that comes from working at a client site. I'm actually working the entire day out of my companies office. This is the most relaxed I've felt in ages. The really strange thing is that I didn't realize the pressure I put myself under to be 'on' when working for a client. I guess it just goes to prove that I have a serious 'work ethic'. Or maybe just a need to prove myself! :)  Last night was anothe busy night. I didn't sit down until 10:00! When I say I didn't sit down I mean it literally - I even ate standing! I had to do some shopping (I walked in for fat free cheese and Milk and walked out having spent $130 - how does that happen?) Then when I got home I found ants had invaided! Nigel's back in school (last class before he gets his BS! YAY!) so I made him sit down and study while I cleaned the kitchen, cooked dinner, planned and cooked lunches, and cleaned the kitchen AGAIN! Then I worked on the fish tank and finally collaped on the couch. Once again I found I couldn't just SIT there, so I did a nice pilates session before callapsing with a hot wrap for my neck and shoulders. WHEW! I did realize that I can't keep going on like this. I NEED ME time at night so I've got to find a way to divide the work a little better while still giving him time to do his school work. Or - I've got to stop trying so hard and just let SOME things slide - but WHAT? Today I need to plan the weekend, (we've got 4 kids between the ages of 16 and 10 coming over for THREE DAYS!) update the budget, plan and fix tomorrow's meals and find some time to workout.... Oh - and go to the laundrymat and do the laudry for the week! EEK!!! I think I'll make a list and have Nigel pick a few things and I'll try to do the rest. Whatever's not done by 8:00 just WON'T get done! (except the workout). The capricorn in me has been in full force of late.. time to let the monkey out to play! :)  I've got my lunches with me today, but I've been invited out to lunch... still debating - but it's difficult to let all that hard work go to waste... (and all the bad food go to my waist!), so we'll see. The good news is that for the second week in a row I've put on my 'tightest' pair of size 14 slacks and thought - hmmm these are loose! I think I've finally convinced myself that it's not my imagination or wishful thinking... I KNOW that these were washed in hot water and put in the dryer. They SHOULD be tight, but aren't...AND, my weigth's been 179 for two days in a row. If this keeps up I'll reach my goal of 175 before the end of the month after all! woo hooo!

      Last night was GOGOGO from the time I got home until the 9:30pm. I finally collapsed on the couch and curled up to rest... BUT something wouldn't let me and I had to get up and do my leg workout. It was good, I was TIRED, my legs are a little tender today. Most excellent. Eats are VERY clean, lunches were packed last night and I've got them in my bag beside me. I ALMOST fit into my smallest skirt today.. heh. It's actually a size 14, but SOMEONE put it in through the wash and it shrunk (I swear!) It's close though, really close.

      I tend to jump on things, then when I sit down and really THINK about it, realize that maybe I shouldn’t have… the restart is one of those things. but, I realized– that I can’t throw away the start to a challenge – it’s not as if those weeks didn’t happen. They are part of the make up of ME – if the ME I’ve made isn’t what I would like it to be, then I have to change my ACTIONS I can’t turn back time.  I also agree that I need to look further then ’12 weeks’ for me especially… Somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind I think I realize that job ahead of me is going to take a LOT longer then 12 weeks. More like 31 weeks (If I’m lucky). But at the same time, it’s important for me to think about and keep sight of the small goals along the way. The next 12 weeks – the next week – the next day! No – I’m not 12 weeks from perfection, but I’m one day away from a better me… and the day after that, and the day after that ad nausium…  Impatience what a NASTY word, and yet so much a part of me – Lack of vision, that I’ve been working on, and I believe I look beyond the next 12 weeks. But it never hurts to be reminded…  As for basing my progress, and my schedule on what EAS churns out – that I WON’T do!  Now – as for my report –  I didn’t workout last night. I was just feeling too crappy still. BUT I made sure today started out AWSOME by fixing my lunch and having it all ready to go this morning. Makes my entire day better when I start it with my lunch already packed! All the crappyness from yesterday was gone today when I woke up and it only reinforces that I need to STAY AWAY FROM MILK!! Food had been right on schedule, and I’m planning a leg workout for tonight.

      I guess I’ll start at the beginning…  Friday I got off early, but was busy getting the house, cat and car ready for the weekend.  No rest for the wicked – we finally were ready to leave at about 7:30pm.  No workout :( We stopped at the store and I picked up some ‘authorized’ snacks because I knew we would be on the road for a while and I figured I would need to eat at least one more meal before we got there.  I have one question though, what is it about driving for long distances that turns me into a ‘munchie monster’? Still I kept it authorized and other then the missed workout counted it as a successful day.  We got in to Nigel’s parents house at about 3:00am, we dropped off right to sleep.  I didn’t get up in time to do more then get ready and eat before we were off to the orchid show.  So I missed my run.  We had some trouble finding things we could eat in his parents refrigerator so we stopped at the store and picked up some supplies.  Nigel’s dad cornered me at one point to ask why Nigel was on a diet… I didn’t really know what to say.  We did really good on each of our plans until about 3:00pm.  We were tired hungry and dropped into a restaurant with less then ideal choices – that’s when the dam broke!  The rest of the weekend was a feeding frenzy!  One interesting tid-bit is when we went to Chinese later that night I broke open my fortune and it said, “Work on Improving your Exercise Routine”.  I kid you not!  The culmination of the weekend was a Oreo Cookie Shake for me last night.  MAN did I pay for it!  I had a tummy ache for the rest of the evening.  I work up this morning with what I suspect was a sugar hang over and/or the rest of my allergic reaction to the dairy.  My nose was stuffed up, I felt like I was going to hurl and I could hardly walk across the room I was so dizzy!  No more milkshakes for me!  I’ve gradually felt better as the day has worn on, thank goodness.  I did go shopping this afternoon.  I picked up my second pair of size 12 pants!!  And (TMI alert) a new bra in a smaller size!  The pants are a little tight but wearable and another goal for me to shoot for (them fitting properly).    Another note regarding this weekend:  I came home to FINALLY find my EAS packet in the mail… too late for me to send in my four-week progress photos!  So, today I called EAS and asked them what to do.  The guy was nice and informed me that I should simply take pictures now and indicate on the packet how long of time it was… Then send in my 12-week pictures at the correct time.  Not receiving my EAS packet was one of the things that prompted me to restart my challenge – now I find out that I can still go with my original start date!  And I will – I want this to be a year of transformation for me, and while January wasn’t stellar for me it was still part of this year, and part of this transformation.  This means that I don’t miss the first round! Yay!  So tonight, I’ll be taking my photos with the ‘regular’ camera and tomorrow I’ll be getting them developed.  If all goes well I’ll have my four week pictures into EAS by tomorrow afternoon! So, that leaves me 7 weeks to finish my first round ‘transformation’.  Put your tray tables and seat backs in the upright position and fasten your seatbelts – it’s going to be a bumpy ride!

      Took off early yesterday so I could be home before dark. I changed clothes, and headed off to the track. I wasn't really sure what my goals for the day were going to be, but after I started I desided to do a moderate intensity cardio and go for distance instead of time. I suppose the most interesting part of the workout was when I got to 1.25 miles and checked my watch - it seems I run at the same 'average' pace weather I'm doing Moderate Intensity or Interval training because I got to almost the same exact spot on the track at 17 minutes last night as I did on Tuesday. I did the last lap (to bring the total to 1.5 miles) at a level 10 and finished in 19:30. For a penguin like me - who hasn't run since October I'm pretty happy with that! The best part is that I'm not having any trouble at all with my planter faciitis. My calves are still tight in that weird spot - and I'm starting to think that it has something to do with the spongy condition of the track. Still I'm working through it. Most importantly I feel FANTASTIC mentally. I'm getting SO much done at night. AND my pant-o-meter is still showing postive signs and - as if I didn't need further proof that my scale is whacked - my weight was 169 today. lol! I think it's probably more like 179. But more importantly I'm feeling energized and thinner... This weekend will pose a challenge as Nigel and I are driving down south to visit his parents. We're leaving right after work, so I don't know when I'll get my upper body workout in. And then eating 'clean' while visiting someone else - esecially someone who like to take us out to dinner - is always a challenge. Nigel's diet is even stricter (is that a word?) then mine so he's really got a challenge. (He's keeping his fat below 10% AND sugar below 10% of his carbs) Still we're both committed so we can support each other...

      I went by the store, and since I was getting the oil changed on my car picked up "Prevention" magazine to read while I waiting.  Not something I normally read but there was a BEAUTIFUL picture of Fergie on the front and I wanted to read what she had to say... BUT I ran across THIS article   urlLink How do you see your body?  and this  urlLink Love the Body You Have   Interesting!    AND some info that Chaste tree may help PMDD symptoms!!   urlLink Herbal Solution for Severe PMS  WHOOP I've added that to my list for next time I go to the vit store...

      Yesterday was really interesting. As I said before I managed to make it through my meeting and avoid the egg rolls and chicken wings - I got home about 9:00pm and was starving and exhausted. I ate, changed into my P.J.'s and curled up on the couch thinking I would nod off. But I didn't! My concious wouldn't let me. I kept thinking about my goals and how it felt every time I wrote out those goals as if I had already achieved them. I wanted those feelings to be REAL and that meant doing the time... So I got up, changed into my workout clothes and did my leg workout! Super set of plie' squats, dead lifts, squats and split squats 60 lbs 15 reps. I rested and did the whole thing again at 40 lbs! Mentally and Emotionally it felt like an awsome breakthrough. I'm finally back to honoring self promices!  I did a really funny thing last night. Something that's been on my 'to do' list for a while. I scanned the cover of a M&F Her magazine from a few months back. I've been saving this one just for the body of the girl that was on the cover.... I LOVE her look. So I scanned the cover and then paisted my head on it. I have to say that for maybe 1/2 a second or so I actually could see it... see myself wearing that body. The rest of the time I was too busy laughing.  My fiance' and I spent some time talking last night about goals and such. What's funny is even HE can't really wrap his head around my ultimate goal - 130. I want to lose 50 pounds! I guess I don't look or act the way that people think that someone who has 50 pounds to lose should? Anyway he finally aquiessed to the idea provided I don't get all skinny and stringy. "You have to have muscle!" was his comment. GOD, I LOVE that man! :) I assured him that 130 is a LONG way off. 9 months if I lose 2 lbs a week, and that has NEVER happend to me. Basically I told him that there was pleanty of time between then and now to reassess... He's allowed to say 'stop!' at any point along the road. In reality though my goal at the moment is 175... I told him that I can't remember what it feels like to be less then that - everything past that is all new ground. There is no doubt in my mind that my 'weight perception' is warped - I remember being unhappy in Highschool at 125 and sometimes wonder if it was just the anorexic 80's that spawned that feeling, or if I really am a lot smaller framed then I think.... BUT - as I said - those numbers are a LONG way off so for now I'm focusing on today! :)

      Well, like the bone-head I'm known to be I left the 1/2 of a sandwich that I had planned for my dinner at work! And, as I suspected, there was nothing that wasn't breaded and/or fried at the meeting. When I commplained that I couldn't eat anything and someone asked why I answered "Because I'm alergic to being fat!" The good news I nibbled some fresh veggies and ate dinner when I got home! AND I did my lower body workout - it's turning out to be a GREAT week! More tomorrow!

      I went to the store and firmed up my nutrition plans for the day. 1 Turkey Sandwich from the Deli (On sliced bread NOT a roll) and a few nutrition bars and I'm set. 1/2 the sandwich for lunch, 1/2 for dinner (I'm not going to trust "Heavy Apitizsers" again) a bar for a mid-morning snack and a bar for mid-afternoon. Now the only challenge left is skipping 'a drink with the boys' after the meeting is over!

      Another Day Down  And I'm happy to say GREEN! I did as I planned and got off work early. Then I rushed home, changed and went outside for a run. It felt so good! I swear it felt as if I was flying around the track! I did the first mile in 12 minutes (a pretty good run for me) and in the 17 I ran I went just over 1.25 miles. The wierdest thing is that my gait seems to have changed some. I seem to be streching further forward (perhaps a reduction in my tummy roll?) and bounding off my back foot more - or so I'm assuming - because I got sore in a totally new spot. Just below the curve of my calf - not low enough to my ankle or achiles but not high enough for me to consider it my calf. Normally my first few runs I'm feeling it in my shins and my foot. I spent the rest of the night last night hobbling around because it hurt to flex or point my foot.  Needless to say pushing myself like that was a challenge. But a good one! By the time I finished I was REALLY FINISHED! One thing I'm curious about Tom is how you mange to run when it's so COLD outside!? It wasn't even THAT cold out but I felt the effects of it. For one, my eyes water when I run in the cold - so that starts my nose running, so it gets hard to breath through my nose so I start breathing through my mouth - spit builds up, and the cold gets into my lunges and burns... When I stopped my lungs hurt, my head hurt - my sinuses hurt from breathing the cold and I felt sick from sucking air into my stomach - and wierdest of all, my JAW hurt. And yet - at the same time I felt elated! I had set a goal and met it! I actually met the goal I set at the begining of each interval too and that helped push me along!  Nutrition was on track for the day too. Today will be a little more challenging as I have a 'dinner' meeting and I didn't pack my lunches today so I'll be eating on the run most of the day. I have a loose plan in my head of how to get through and I'm feeling confident enough to pull it off! I'm still passing up the table full of leftover Christmas food. and yesterday skipped the birthday cake. Surprisingly I haven't had any major cravings, though I'm pretty sure that has to do with keeping my fat levels nice and high.

      Yesterday was a great day. Food was on plan and CLEAN. I did a short but intense upper body workout and even managed to keep my diet soda intake to a 'reasonable' level. I'm looking forward to another clean day today. My lunches are packed and ready for when hunger strikes! The only possible stumbling block is that SOMEONE brought in chirstmas candy! What WERE they thinking!? But I'm having no cravings and walking past it a few times has produces NO twinges.  One MAJOR alteration in my thinking this challenge is that - due to my irratic workout schedule, I'm not going to eat as if I AM working out. Instead I'm going to go lighter throughout the day and if I manage to workout, add an extra shake at the end of the day. We'll see how it goes over the next few weeks.  The plan tonight is to get off early and hopefully get a run in before it gets too dark. If that doesn't happen then it will be a nice quiet evening with Billy Blanks. In eather case, I'm planning to do some Pilates as I've found that really makes my feel GREAT afterwords and does wonder for my posture.  I'll leave you with this insite from a friend of mine...  "I had a moment yesterday where I just wanted to say "forget it, this is too hard" but then I knew I'd be so disappointed in myself and besides, on the scale of things, this isn't that hard. Getting a divorce is hard, letting go of a loved one is hard, giving up an addiction is hard...but honoring and respecting your body by feeding it well and making it a fit machine is simply conforming to nature."

      I started my first 2004 challenge 4 weeks go - so it was time to take progress pictures. As I suspected there was No progress to be found. I even got a second opinion to be sure. My fiancé agreed, the two pictures could have been taken the same day they were THAT identical to each other. Every view...  A first I was bummed. After all, there was this part of my mind that had hoped that the scale was just being stubborn and that I was making OTHER changes all this time. But no. My fiancé began to worry about me. I got a nice long hug from him and a pep talk. He basically said "I don't want you to get discouraged and give up." Well, I'm NOT giving up. I've decided to 'reboot' the year. Yes, I'm going to press Ctrl-Alt-Del and begin with a fresh face, clean slate. No more memory errors :) I took a good LONG look at those pictures. and I mean REALLY looked. Although I wear my clothes well and I AM into a size 12 (below average for the US female population I'm told) there is a LOT of unhealthy fat hanging onto my body, especially on my lower abdomen. My fiancé even asked me "Doesn't that bother you, weigh you down and make you feel.. bah?" I explained to him that I've weighed this much or more since I was 19 - this feels 'normal' to me. I think that's why it's so easy to 'just have a nibble' and 'skip just this one workout'. And after all, what I spend the most time looking at is my hands and wrists and they are pretty slim looking. But it's not enough anymore to have pretty hands. I want to get some of this FAT off of me! The only way I know to do that is to stick to my diet and to exercise. I went to bed last night with visions of success dancing in my head and I think that's a good thing. I decided to do as several have suggested and write my goals as if I’ve already achieved them. I started composing my four-week goals as I drifted off and I will finish them before the end of the day.  Food is planned and on plan – Upper body for tonight – no excuses!!

      I seriously had NO intension of falling off the face of the earth!  really, I swear!  But, a little flue bug came by our house and desided to take up residence.  ICK!  First my fiance' then me!  I spent last week in a fog of missery AND, need I say my diet went out the window!?  Well it did.  I ate anything and everything I could get my hands on, the worse the better.  I did manage to get one workout in on Tuesday - right before my throat swelled up and I felt like I was swollowing razor blades!  I say again ICK!  I was all set to make a 'big turn around' today - the I went out and bought 4 bags of easter candy *sigh*.  But, there is no reason why I can't continue to make progress from 'this MOMENT forward'.  Clean eats for me, for the rest of the day.  If I can string the next few 'next days' together, then I'll have a week, and after that a month.. etc, etc.  I'm ready, really I am (yes, I know I've said this before)  sometimes I think I'm sick of hearing MYSELF say it... but I refuse to stop saying it.  There was a time when a week like my last week would have had me back to old habits and giving up on EVER losing weight.  But I refuse to do that again!  It's onward - back into the frey - to fight the good fight...

      Hey!  I'm linked - who'ed a thunk?  Thanks  urlLink AMY!   Wow - the pressure is on!?    I figured out something today while in the store.  I'm a narcisist.  One of the main reasons I love BFL.  Not just because I can lose weight and have more energy, but because when I'm at the store, shopping for soda, I can toat two six packs of  bottles around.  Not only can I do this easily much to the surprise of others in the store.  but when I'm wearing a sleaveless blouse like today I would like to think that there is a certain, form and deffinition in my arms that must also be admired... Ok - OK so I'm not the center of anyone's universe (except my fiance')  But I would like to imagine that people are sneeking peeks at delts and biceps while I'm toating around my food... Either way it does make me want to work that much harder so that if they arn't... they will be in the near future!  I'm such a glory hound!    I also wanted to give a shout out to my good friend  urlLink CORY .  While his website probably has 1000 times as many hits as mine in a day - I wanted to throw a little love his way.  I'll probably be adding a few links to this site soon, but as I'm a bit of a procrastinater I wanted to do a few now to make sure there were in here SOMEWHERE!

      Yesterday went really really well!  I can't believe what a difference a treadmill makes.  Not only allowing me to run no matter the weather, but getting me to push myself harder then I would if I were running outside.  It's so much easier to pace myself.  Easier to set and reach goals...  I have to say it was a little humbling to read a friends post and see he WALKS at the same speed I run!  I blame it on my short little legs I suppose.  I did the same intervals as last time - 4.0 - 5.5mph in .5 increments x 3 and then on the fourth interval pumping it up to 6.0.  I then kept running at 4.0 until I made to to my goal of 1.5 miles.  Second workout of my marathon training DONE!  It was MUCH harder this time. I could tell my legs were tired from my run on Tuesday and then my leg workout on Wednesday.  But I managed, and felt SO good after.  Had an AWSOME dinner (I'm back into cooking again) Chicken dregged in non-fat plain yogurt and then rolled in breadcrumbs and baked.  With aspearagus and baked potato on the side...  I can tell I'm working out regularly again because MAN do I have an appitite.  While the chicken was in the oven I did 20 minutes of Yoga.  So all my goals were accomplished!  Then, I even made my lunches for today.  That's a BIG step for me.  A sure sign I'm back into the groove.  I need to hit the upper body hard today.  Food is planned and that's cool, and I'm going to try to drink a bit more water then usual ... see if I can get some of this fat to MOBILIZE...   Good Friday Ya'all

      I thought I would include some of my goals here so - just another way to hold myself accountable.  In 4 weeks I will:  Weigh 170 lbs and have a body fat % of 37. In 6 weeks I will:  Weigh 167 and have a body fat % of 35 In 8 weeks I will:  Weigh 163/33% In 12 weeks I will: Weigh 157/29%  My ultimate Goal is 130lbs and less then 20% But since I haven't been below 175 since I graduated Highschool (16 years ago) it's hard to say what my goal will ultimately be until I get closer to it.   Other then the pure numbers I have other goals:  1) - Terminator Arms.  Even under the fat I think I have pretty shaply arms and I can't wait to see what they look like under all that 2) - Run a Marathon.  I started on Tuesday with my marathon running program.  First goal (of course) is to run a 5K but eventually I plan to run in a Marathon Next August 3) - Six Pack.  Yes the ever present 'six pack' goal.  Even if it's only for a day I want to see it... just once 4) Be healthy and happy!  One of the biggest motivators for excercise, for me, is to be able to engage in activities that most people don't consider... like biking 26 miles, sea kyacking, white water rafting... (all things I did last year)  5) 10 Pushups, 10 Pullups, 10 Headstand pushups...Yes I dream BIG..  I'm sure there are more goals in there, but that's all I can come up right now...  Also, I came across the meal plan my good friend Marie gave to me last year... what a nice easy place to start!  all the 'planning' is done (I love that ) I just have to measure and eat... simple!  I'm going to follow this for the next week and half then go from there... I'm actually getting, dare I say.. EXCITED about the changes to come.. AGAIN!

      Well, I tracked my food yesterday and I think I'm seeing SOME of the problem.  Not NEARLY enough protien.  I've never been much of a meat eater so I can see how, without a plan I tend to subcontiously avoid protien.  Today I'm looking for things to go a little better.    Excercise was 100%  and I loved it!  I did my leg workout, and upped the weights.  I had started out easy(ish) last week to keep from overdoing it and felt like it was ok to push things a little harder this week.  It went well.  Then I did about 10 minutes of pilates to really nail the abs and 'remind' my muscles to legthen and relax a little.  After feeling sluggish and groggy most of the afternoon it really did a lot to 'perk' me up.  I was still struggling with 'the grumpies' but a talk with my fiance' soon banished the last of that and the rest of the evening was SMOOTH sailing.  I copied a CD to run to tonight and I'm looking forward to seeing how the songs work...  I'm still only doing 1.5 miles but that will be picking up next week.    I'm sore - but then I'm expecting to be.  It actually feels good.  It feels like I"m preparing my body for something important and I am.  After all, what's more important than LIVING?

      I thought I really really really wanted a 'no-plan' nutrition plan.  But I'm finding that I don't really like the 'drifting' feeling I've had over the past few weeks.  It must be the project manager in me, or maybe that I'm anal retentive?  So, somehow I need to find a balance between - so focused that I'm spending every moment thinking, planing and or eating food and this 'fly by the seat of my pants' thing I've been doing.  So - today I'm going to start logging on fitday again.  That at least gives me some sort of accountability.  I know for one it will keep me from eating when I'm 'less then hungry' because I know the extra work it will take to log all of that.    After a week I'll sit down and evaluate this again.  As far as excercise, for the first time in a long time I feel like I'm SET.  I've got my weights, and my treadmill.   No excuses! :)  The only thing that would make my life complete would be a chin up bar, but that's not on my list of essentials.  I feel like I made up the missed upper body workout yesterday with lugging around that treadmill, and I did my Interval Run - followed by a moderate.  I run for 1.5 miles total wich was my goal with my marathon training.  The rest of the week looks like this:  Today - Lower body workout.  Thursday - 1.5 miles (20 minutes of wich will be HIIT), Friday - Upper Body Workout, Saturday - 1.5 mile run, Sunday - at least 30 minutes walking or Hiking.  My appointment with the career counceler went really well, though I'm still not sure how much this is going to cost me.  Still, I see better things on the horizon.  In every portion of my life.

      Last night was GREAT.  I kicked butt on the treadmill doing 1 minute intervals of 4mph, 4.5mph, 5mph, and 5.5mph.. and then a final 1 minute at 6mph all at 1.5% incline.  After pushing the silly treadmil around for a while, then that run I was EXAUSTED!  I still found the energy to do about 20 minutes of Yoga though.  I was in bed by 9:00.  Feeliing really good today, both mentally and physically.  My legs and back are sore, but nothing I can't live with.    I have an appointment this morning with a career counceler.  Depending on the cost, I might be using them to try to get some focus and direction in my life.    My mood is better and the weight has dropped back below 180 and stayed there.  I'm ready to start seeing some steady progress instead of this roller coaster ride I've been on!!  Have a great day eveyone!

      The treadmill has arrived!!! and I got my workout in just shoving it around and setting it up.  The bloody thing weighs over 270lbs!  BUT it's all set up, I just need to run to the store and pick up a headphone splitter and I'll be SET!!!It's going to be hard not to push myself too far and too fast at first... but the newness will wear off soon Í'm sure.  Until then I'm going to take advantage of all this energy!.. My marathon training starts TODAY with a grand total of.... 1.5 miles! lol!  when I said I was going to start slowly, I wasn't kidding.  Basically I'm doing a novice training routine for a 5K... then I'll do training for an 8K then 10K then 15K and so on and so forth... ramping my miles up then dropping them back down only to ramp them up again... kind of like Interval training over a year's time :) it all culminates in a marthon in August of next year :)  In the meanwhile I'm going to work on getting my weight down and also continue to workout with weights especially legs because I need to rehabilitate this foot of mine...   So, I'm off to the electronics store...  Oh!  and I promised pictures from our hike on Saturday.  They are Here: www.bafoa.com/past_adventures1.htm

      Well, today is a little better then yesterday.  Still got the monthly blues but they are lifting a bit.  The treadmill is supposed to be here between 12:00 and 3:00!!!  I tried a little 'retail therapy' at lunch yesterday.  While I didn't buy anything it did prove one thing to me.  While my weight isn't moving much my SIZE is...  I won't buy another size 14.  They are all too big!   On a sour note, by the time I got home last night I had a killer stomach ache.  I never have heartburn, and I HAD heartburn.  The thought of doing squats with the burning ALREADY in the back of my throat just didn't sit with me... so I skipped the workout.  Not a very auspicious start.  Still, I've had some really postive experiances of late and I'm feeling motivated and inspired.  I guess the real thing I'm trying to convey is that I feel HOPE.  And that's a big step for me.

      Let's start with the good news.  The weekend was GRAND!  The relationship with my son, seems to have finally healed!  Every visit things seem to get better and better, and that does my heart a world of good.  Friday night on the way home he was looking out the car window and noting the stars.  We talked about stars, and constilatioins and then when we go home, we drug out the telescope and did a little star gazing... it was a lot of fun.  Saturday all six of us went for a hike...Really awsome walk through the woods to a waterfall.  I will be uploading some pictures later tonight.    Sunday, I went over and set up my Grandmother's new computer.   My son helped me move stuff around and get files transfered over.  She's thrilled!  In Other news :)  I didn't make up Thursday's Cardio, nor did I do my upper body workout on Friday.  So, now I've 14 days left to make 'em green!   It's hard to explain my mood right now.  I'm really upset that I weighted in at 182 today and yet I'm more determined then ever to string together some green days.  I keep visualizing how COOL this summer can be - walking around feeling strong and confident in my body and that motivates me more then anything.  I have a formal dinner/dance in April that I want to be as sleek as possible for as well.  All motivating factors... I just need to continue to put all that motivation into action.

      I wish I had an explination for this total change of attitude I've had.  For some reason missing tonight's workout just wasn't an option, even though I had a TON of other things to do including (ahhhhhh!!!) LAUNDRY!!  When I finally got home from the 'Fluff and Fold' and finished putting all my clothes away, it was 10:00.  And yet, as I said no where did I think "maybe I should just do it tomorrow" or "I'll make it up over the weekend".  Nope not at all.  The closest I came to an arguement with myself was desiding weather I was going to do the full pyramid workout or supersets.  I did the full pyramid workout.  It felt great!  Ok, so it hurt like HECK but mentally it felt GREAT!   Food today was clean and I really do feel like I'm doing the right thing for ME right now.  It's such a tremendous feeling!  I certainly don't want it to end.  So I'll keep on keeping on.

      I desided to blog from home as I've been so busy at work that I can't seem to string together cohearant thoughts.    A few things that meant to mention in past blogs but haven't.  I'm getting more and more pleasure out of my clothes of late.  Spring has sprung and that means summer clothes.  So, Saturday I pulled out a pair of shorts and put them on.  To say I was pleased was probably an understatment, but I was very pleased.  The shorts not only fit, but were a little loose.  I was doubly pleased because I have another pair of shorts exactly like them, but (I thought) a size smaller in my drawer that would now fit as well.  You can only imagine my surprise AND delight when I took out my second pair of shorts on Sunday and found out that these were the LARGER of the two pairs!  The hung off me like a gunny sack!  The shorts that I had worn on Saturday were the pair that last summer had been too tight!    Last night, while in costco I desided to pick up a pair of slacks as a reward for reaching 175.  I chose my size carefully (I hate that you can't try on clothes there) and brought them home.  I have to admite that I had some pretty negative thoughts alone in my bedroom before putting them.  I held them up and looked and thought to myself "there is no way that these will fit!" I had visions of how awful they were going to look and was totally prepared to be disapointed.  Instead, they went on, buttoned up and ... looked GREAT.  Probably the only dissapointing thing was that they are capris and my legs are just TOO short for capris to look completely 'right'on me.  Still, I'm so pleased that they fit other places to be at all dissapointed in the length.  Ok, so back to today.  I got home from work late and wasn't really sure what I was going to do for cardio.  It was too late to run outside and my treadmill isn't here yet.  I remembered seeing a cadio program in M&F Hers November Issue. In truth it's a combo full body weight program and cardio program, but I simply did the routine with 2 lb dumbells and made it 100% cardio.  Here is what it looks like:  Squat to Overhead Press x 10 Front Heel Taps x 30 seconds Bent-Over Row to Tricep Kickback x 10 Butt Kicks x 30 sec Squat to Uppercut x 10 Rocking Horse x 30 sec Front Lunge to Biceps Curl x 10 Side-to-side Suffle x 30 sec Ball Flye to Abdominal curl x 10 Squat Trust x 30 sec Side Squat to Side Lateral Raise x 10 Jog in place x 30 sec Diagonal Rotation x 10 Split Jacks x 30 sec Stability Ball Cest Press to Overhead Triceps Extension x 10 Front Heal Taps x 30 sec Stability ball Leg Curl to Hip Bridge x 10 Jumping Jacks x 30 sec Romanian Deadlift to Row x 10 Fast Feet x 30 sec  By the end I was huffing, puffing and sweating.  But I have to say it was a LOT of fun!  it's certainly a valid alternative for me.  Food today has been great - my new nutrition plan is really simple... 1 protien, 1 carb, 1 fat and as many vegatables as I can stand about 6 times per day.  I'm also trying to eat as close to nature as possible.  The real difference is that I'm not being terribly structured... I eat when I'm hungry and stop before I'm too full.  Many times doing things like fixing a sandwich eating 1/2 of it, and then in a few hours eating the rest.  This is saving me a BUNCH of planning and preperation time.  So far, so good!  alright, I think that's enough from ME for one day...

      I did something ELSE that really has me excited AND has helped me to change my focus from short term to long term.  I put together a training program from a running web site and the culmiation of it is a Marathon NEXT YEAR.  :)  I know in order to build up strength and prevent me from reinjuring my foot I'll need to go slow.. SO I'm planning to do this NEXT YEAR!!  I think that's one thing that has changed recently in my mind set.  I'm thinking long term.  I see my goals and I want them, but I'm feeling a LOT more patient.  Maybe it helps that I finally hit my 16 year goal of 175.  MAN!  That just sunk in THIS INSTANT - 175 has been my goal for 16 YEARS!!!  10 pounds from now I will be the wieght I was when I graduated high school!!    I really don't know how or why my mind has changed.  Slow and steady seems to be a good thing right now and I'm ready and willing to accept that..

      Yesterday was very very good.  When I got off work I went by costco and then safeway and got some 'good eats' for the rest of the week.  It's funny, but I'm really excited about the next 21 days!  I haven't felt like this all year.  I really feel postive about the choices I'm making and the results I'm sure to see.  For once it doesn't feel like I'm waiting for the ax to fall.  So anyway!  While at costco I got sucked into the book department.  I found a really COOL book -  "Home Workout Bible"  The number and variety of excercises they had in there all geared toward working from home really got me excited about my workouts.  My treadmill should be here ANY day - that's also VERY exciting... And I've been sticking to my plan, and feeling really good mentally and physically in regard to food.  My upper body workout last night was just right... not too easy, not too hard.  Hit my 10's!  I felt SO GOOD afterwords.. mentally AND physically.  I'm on top of the world right now, and intend to stay here!

      Oh, what a beautiful morning, oh what a beautiful day!  I've got a beautiful feeling, everything's going my way...  Yes folks it was THAT sort of weekend.  Even with me being sick!    Friday:  Went home early - I was really starting to feel BAD.   Got home, went to bed and slept 'til morning.  (except for getting up to pop some Vitamine C and Echinatia and Vitamine E). The best part was, even though my body was SCREEMING for comfort food I didn't give in, ate on plan!  Saturday:  Woke up feeling week and groggy.  A shower, breakfast and a little sunshine later and I was doing pretty good.  My fiance was working on his Jeep so I did the 'run to Kragen and see if they have...."  thing.  By noon I was pretty much feeling about 80%.  I got some little 'chores' out of the way and got to do some shopping (used book stores!  my favorite), as well as some driving through some of the most amazingly beautiful countryside.  Reminded me why I live in California... Northern California to be exact.  At first I had suggested we go out to eat, but then I realized that I had deemed Sunday a Free day, so I desided to 'save' it for then.  Instead we swung past the store and picked up some fresh pork chops and asparagus.  YUM!  Sunday:  Woke up feeling MUCH better... My free day was VERY much in control.  I indulged in a few things I had been craving (chocolate and pizza) but all in moderation.  My fiance and I spent the day 'sharing' our food and that kept my portions small.  I didn't binge either.  In all I declare it a Sucess!  PLUS, we went for a 'walk' on Sunday.  We left the house at 11:00am, drove (again) through BEAUTIFUL countryside, down to Mill Valley.  From there we walked to Sausalito a little town on the coast just north of San Francisco.  the walk there and back was (we think) about 14 miles!  and we finally headed home about 4:45.    Today:  I started my new program.  The day is BEAUTIFUL sunny, warm, and I'm sunburned.  I'm not too sore from our walk, just twinges in places.  Spring in here and I'm in a GREAT mood.  I'm looking forward to the next couple of weeks and my new plan/program.  I'll keep you filled in as things go!  Oh - weight on Saturday (before free day) - 175!!! I made it!  and I plan to be back down there again NO problem!  177 today.

      Ok - let me see, so much to say.  Yesterday was clean, again.  My weight is staying steady below 180 and I'm VERY happy with that!  It's getting to be time to deside the next step.  I think the last two weeks were verry successful.  I got my will power back, relearned how to tell myself "NO", and got and have STAYED below 180.  So my options as I see it are:  1) Keep doing what I'm doing now. A VERY unstructured low carb regiem 2) Follow the first faze of the South Beach Diet 3) Go back to fist/palm BFL style of eating.    In truth I'm leaning heavily toward BFL again.  And the reason why is, my own words!  I went back yesterday and read though my jornal from the beginning.  In noting how I felt and what my results where BFL in it's purest form as I did it in the begining worked REALLY well.  Of course, at the time, I was also following my excercise program fairly regularly as well.  I just know I really want to find that fire again.  The arrival of Spring should help.  It's BEAUTIFUL here.  More outdoor time, more unstructured 'excercise' (hiking, biking etc) should all help my progress as well as my mood.  Anyway - as I said, I'm leaning toward BFL and I think I'm going to make it REALLY simple.  My plan is to print up a list of 'authorised foods'.  Then, pick one thing from each column.  Simple!  I'm also going to stock up at work, cans of chicken keep really well, as well as Salads and/or potatoes.  If I'm not having to constantly pack my lunch I think I'll feel a LOT less overwhelmed.    Starting next week, my workouts will return as a priority.  With my food 'simplified' that leaves me that much more time for my workout.  As I looked through my journal there were days when I was tired, days when I was down, but those days that I pushed through and worked out anyway just seem to GLOW with energy... I want that glow back!  NO MORE EXCUSES!  As I said I should be getting a lot more 'unplanned' workouts with the coming of spring/summer.  Plus with my treadmill arriving in about a week and a half, running should be a no-brainer.  I have all the equipment I need for good weight workouts so the only thing holding me back would be ME!  I'm going to do everything I can to kick THAT obstical out of the way.  I want results, I want that energy, I want those positive self thoughts back.  I want to feel as if success is just a workout away.  I CAN do this, and I WILL

      I just finished lunch.  I started to have a sandwich, thinking to myself 'just this one won't hurt', but then I realized that I had promised myself that I would stick with this for the entire two weeks.  And that 'just one' has a way of becoming just three or four or more.  So I didn't.  I had an on plan lunch and truethfully I'm feeling pretty good about it.  Yes 'just one' may not 'hurt' physically.  But mentally it can make a MAJOR difference in how I think and feel about myself.  And THAT is enough to derail me BIG time.

      Well - my treadmill should ship Friday and arrive in a week.  BLEH!  I hate waiting!  BUT it will finally BE here, I can hardly believe it.    Yesterday was clean again.  No major struggles.  I can say I'll be glad when I can add a LITTLE bit of bread back into my diet.  I did spend some time thinking today about food the scale and my apparent obsession with both :P.  Several people have mentioned to me that this should be about HEALTH not WEIGHT.  And I was pondering that on my way into work.  Truth be told, I was doing pretty good, health wise when I was eating, normal, everyday foods in limited quanties.  (Yes folks that HORRIBLE 'monderation' word.)  I really don't think I was any worse or better off.  The real reason that I eat the way I do (or attempt to) is for my weight.  And not my weight as it relaits to my health, but PURELY for vanity.  To quote an article I read - To Look Good Naked!  And where did all this pondering get me?  At the moment - no where :)  But I'll continue to update here as things move along.  Otherwise, I'm feeling pretty cranky today.  No aparent reason.  Well, actually, it's work.  My job takes these turns where it's really exciting and intense for a couple weeks and then it settles down into mind numbing bordum.  Durning the 'bordum' stages I tend to get to feeling pretty unfullfilled.  Ok, OK I understand that everything in life goes through cycles but these tend to last for several months.  I feel like my training is being waisted... heck _I_ am being waisted.  and I HATE busy work!  Ah well, what's important is I'm not trying to fill in the empty spots with food.  That never does anyone any good.  Not much else to report on.  Maybe I'll think of something later.

      I'm feeling better today.  Last night I desided that, though I've been avoiding bars so that I didn't hamper my progress, it was better to have a bar then to end up having a dozen doughnuts.  So I grabbed one and felt MUCH better afterwords.  I also made sure I had a GOOD dinner - cream sauce and chicken over cauliflour.  And I had 'desert' too.  riccotta cheese mixed with peanut butter.  Ok, so I admit that was a little wierd, but it was pretty good.  Still it was 'odd' enough that I doubt I'll have it again.  Today I'm feeling 100% again.  Strong and in control and not hanging on by a fingernail.    I didn't get a workout in last night, but I'm not stressing over it.  Eventually, I'll start firing on all cylinders again.  The BEST news is that I'm ordering my treadmill tonight!!  Some personal things are looking up as well and I have to say the whole world is looking a little brighter.  Ok, so it's not raining either and that helps.

      I'm fighting.  Not cravings per se but, temptations.  Everywhere I turn it seems there is something I would like to be eating, but 'can't'.  I've managed to say no for a week now but really wonder how long I'll be able to hold out.  In a way it's depressing.  If I could just lock myself in my house and only look at 'autherized' foods I would be just fine.  I really don't crave food anymore.  But the minute I see something the urge to EAT comes over me.  Before, I could put off those feelings and relieve them with a 'free day'.  But, now... now I'm faced with forgoing those foods for a much longer stretch of time.  I really wonder what has to change inside of me before I don't fear a trip to the store.   In fact, I'm reminded of a question I asked a long time ago.  Does it ever get easier?  I expect it does and I sure hope it does, because I'm not sure I can keep this kind of intensity up indefinatly.  I suppose that sounds fatalistic, but it's also completely honest.  And it's only been a WEEK!  Ha!  I've also discovered that lingering in the back of my mind is fear.  Fear of letting myself free of this uber strick regiem I've put myself on and having another major back slide.  How to begin to put balance back into my life without letting 'just one' become 'just twenty'.  Every time I think of easing back a little there I face that fear.  But I know I'll have to eventually.  I can't deny myself treats forever.   Then the question becomes - when?  I promised myself I would do this until I reached 175.  A kick in the butt.  A jump start into the next phase of weightloss - getting down to the 'before children' weights.  But, then what?  I can assure you that if/when I figure it all out I'll share it with you all...

      Well - it happened.  For the first time this year I had a CLEAN weekend!  It wasn't easy.  In fact I don't think there was a challenge I didn't have to face down!  Friday we went to Olive Garden - and in case it wasn't apparent before, I'll state here and now that I'm a Bread and Pasta FREEK!  I did all I could to distract myself from the bread when it was dropped on the table and made sure to order a grilled dish for my dinner.  Grilled chicken, some itallian sausage and steamed veggies.  At cake time I wasn't thinking and I stood over the cake as I opened the box.  The smell of chocolate waifed up and I swear I turned into Pavlov's dog!  But, I ignored it, sang happy birthday, cut the cake and went to sit at the opposite side of the table.   I didn't even lick the cocolate icing off my fingers!  Saturday, the challenge was pizza, cheese bread and cinnamon bread from Dominos...  The smell of the pizza when it first arrived nearly killed me!  But I ate MY food and distracted myself with visions of size 10 pants... Sunday we took the kids out to brunch and everyone's plate distracted me... pancakes on one side, toasted buns on the other side...  But once again I stuck to my own food.  And THEN my daughter picks up my ABSOLUTE favorite cocolate from the store... I didn't have a single piece.  And the results of all of this?  Beside the fact that I'm really really proud of myself I'm also down to 177.5!  I'm close - so close and I don't want to do ANYTHING to cause a set back now.  I will prove to myself that I CAN meet goals...  I also got some nice excercise this weekend.  Saturday I walked just over a mile, and Sunday we went on about a 3 mile hike.  Nothing too rugged but enough to stretch the legs and get the lungs and heart working.  In fact we walk partially on a PAR course and I stopped a few times to do the excercises on it - pushups and leg lifts and corkscrews - it felt good to be using my muscles again.  Now that I've have a clean nutritional week I'm going to try for both - tonight I'm going to do a light upper body workout.  I want to take advantage of the momentem I've created and make sure it continues.  I'm feeling good today.  REALLY good and I expect for it to continue!

      Yesterday was again "perfect"  Food was on, and I did my weight workout with no issues.  I even upped the weight on everything which was pretty cool!  I hope to continue to do so periodically as I want to be getting stronger as well as gaining endurance as the months go by.  I've never believed in being a 'helpless female'  Will try to update more later.  I have a 3 mile run scheduled for tonight!

      I can't believe it! I just signed up for my first 5K!  It's in two weeks in San Francisco.  It's on mother's day and it's a race that's geared toward women (though men are allowed to run as well).  I'm not really expecting to run the etire way, as a matter of fact I've been training to take walk breaks every 9 minutes.  But I expect it to be a LOT of fun.  After that - those NO stopping me!  an 8k then a 10k and so on, and so forth!  I'm getting SO exctied!  This week was clean for the ENTIRE week!  I think that's the first time that's happend all year!  I want to see many more after this.  I'm ready, ready to take this bull by the horns and see some results.  Actually not only results but I'm ready to see myself reach my goal... the goal is set for November folks!

      Yesterday went great.  I stayed on plan and got  my sweetie back.  Today was even better!  Got my run in and have had a clean day food wise.  I'm really feeling strong, and even passed up mac and cheese at dinner tonight.  and brownies as the office this afternoon.  Feeling good and looking forward to the weekend.  Sunday's a free day but I think I'll keep it pretty low key as I haven't been having any major cravings.  So there's nothing really feel I need to splurge on.  I've been taking in more calories, but still struggled a little with my run.  This was more the normal... man this is hard, I'm breathless kind and of struggling  instead of the man my legs feel like LEAD feeling.  I still found myself counting down the minutes to my next walk break.  Still willing to push myself - I wanna see extraordinary results and those arn't going to happen by ordinary means!  tomorrow I lift again hopefully in the morning so I can run in the evening.  Off to enjoy my luv bug...

      Alright, so I made a mistake, I walked into a clothing store again. *sigh* I just get SO frustrated with sizing.  You see, I tried on some kakis last night that are a size 12.  They button, but won't zip all the way.  So I figured I was just a little bit closer to a size 12 now then I was to a size 14 when I started my first challenge.  BUT, today in the store I picked up four size 12's thanking to have a few 'goal pants' - One (darn hip huggers) I couldn't even button,  Two, fit perfectly, and another I went back out and got a size 10 (which fit perfectly).   So, maybe size 12 not an agressive enough goal?  Well - I'll leave the goal as it is and specifially say that I will fit into MY size 12's that I have sitting at home right now.    And the frustration with my unbalanced body continues (been an issue since Jr High) ... Obviously I'm nearly a 12 on bottom, but I'm still in extra large shirts :(  and size 16 dresses...

      Another clean day!  I did my weight workoutpretty much as planned. I didn't get home until 8:00 pm and was feeling a little frazzled because I wanted to be somewhere at 9:00, BUT I didn't let that stop me!  I went ahead and did my weight workout, I just eliminated the rest periods, wich actually made for an interesting workout that got my heartrate up for a bit.  I think I'm going to end up a little sore tomorrow wich is cool, but I'm pretty sure that I need to up the weights on everything except the biceps (For some reason they are always lagging behind the rest of my body parts)   Well - I just got done inputting the past couple day's  food.  I was right!  I'm WAY under eating - again. Today I only got up to 1200 calories, and while yesterday was around 1500, most of those where late in the day, and it's still no where near the 2000 my calculations say I should be eating right now.  Time to take some SERIOUS action!  I need all my energy to continue running the way I am.  Plan for tomorrow is a little shaky right now.  I know I need to run, but I'm picking up my sweetheart from the airport at 7:00pm.  I'll be leaving to get him right after work.  My guess is that once I get home there is NO WAY I'll want to leave his side long enough to jump on the treadmill.  SO... I either get up early (yeah, that's going to happen - NOT), run at lunch, or push my workout to Friday.  Running at lunch isn't much of a choice either because I sweat SO MUCH when I run.  If worse comes to worse I'll double up tomorrow, but I really don't want to have to do that, it makes me feel like I"m cheeting somehow.    I guess I need to try to get SOME sleep - now - it's only 3:00am! :P

      Not really all that much to report.  Instead of analyzing things I've been gettin them done!  Food's been clean for two days and on track to be clean again today.  I had a great weight workout on Monday and ran 2.75 miles on Tuesday.  In truth it hasn't been all that hard to stay on track.  My sweety is out of town and since we only have one card to access our account with, I sent it with him.  Therefore I've had no cash on hand for snacks and slurges.  That means I'm eating what's at home, and the 'worse' thing I've got there is probably the jar of organic natural peanut butter.  So, food's been clean.  Also, since my honey's not home - I'm doing all I can to keep myself occupied.  This means that it's really easy for me to do my workout as soon as I get home.  If I can just keep these patterns up when he gets back, things will be awsome!   Tonight it's weights again - and tomorrow a 2 mile run.  I'm only a few weeks out from my 5K!  I can hardly believe that I've managed to stick with the training like this.  It's a big boost to my self esteem.    Best news of all is a few day's good eating and I've dropped some water weight.  Clothes are fitting more like I expect again, and the scale is saying 181.5 - That's more like it!!

      So - I still want it THIS Year.  Last week started out grand.  I worked out on Monday - ran on Tuesday.  Then my kids came over and I took three days off work and POOF!  Granted I deliberatly took some time off because my knee was hurting, but I'm still not happy with the way things are going. So, so things WILL change!    I will no longer accept excuses from myself for not working out.  I will spend more energy figuring out how to make my workouts happen instead of figuring out how to get out of them!  I will plan my meals.  I will pick a plan, stick with it - follow it as written and give it a chance to work.  I'm going to do BFL for a few weeks.  In the mean while I'm going to send a request to the staff at Beverly International for them to create a meal plan for me.  They are out of the office until May so it may be a while before they get back to me.  I have recruted a friend to help me.  She's been given the task of following up with me and not accepting my excuses for missed workout or poor meals.  And I've accepted the task of doing the same for her.  I will take no prisoners.  I will reach my goals THIS YEAR!!

      THIS YEAR - Those words have been ringing in my ears all day. You see, if I can average 1.75 pounds per week I will reach my goals THIS YEAR.... I'm desperatly trying to wrap my brain around that thought... to believe it in that little dark place in my heart where all words, of all the doubters in my life tend to gather. Including my own.  But, "This Year," is resounding pretty loudly - I just need to keep it that way.  I started work on my project plan. Adding all my workouts as tasks until November 6th. (That's my goal date). If I miss a workout - it throws off my baseline and pushes out my goal date. Amazing how seeing the DIRECT cause and effect can change your perspective... This Year  Yes, I'm still trying to figure out the nutrition plan. What I wish - is that someone would just hand me a list of foods and say "Eat this today" and then the same the next day and the same the next. Yeah, yeah - it's Jenny Craige dieting I know, but I really don't want to THINK about food any more then nessisary. But, I'm sure there's a happy medium. I'll have to work through my food issues and at the same time make planning my nutrition a priority without it being an obsession. uhm.. yeah.  Still - THIS YEAR!  muhahahahah

      Last Night was crazy!  I got home and immediatly went to the store.  I did a LOT of shopping and ended up spending about 2 hours in the store.  By the time I unpacked grocheries and then fixed and ate dinner it was about 9:30pm and I was tired!  Several excuses for not working out drifted through my head, but, in truth, that visual of a gant chart with my schedule already behind because I've missed one of my tasks got me off the couch.  This is a project, and on a project EVERY task is critical for a sucessful completion of that project.  So, I did the workout.  It actually was really good, though I could raise the weights on both leg excercises.  The stretching felt GREAT and I'm thinking I might even lengthen the time for that as I LOVE to stretch and it might be nice to challenge myself in that area a little more.  After my workout, I colored my hair, so that took up the remainder of my evening.  I still plan on going through ALL the project planning steps and getting a complete set of documents in hand.  Not only because I think it sets things even further in concrete, but because it's fun.    So, today's plan is this.  2.5 miles of running and some yoga/stretching.  I actually forgot my lunch at HOME today (duh) so I'll have to drop by the store to pick up something but I WILL keep in clean.  I will!  Maybe this really IS the 'last time'.  Funny thing.  Last night as we were laying in bed my fiance' asked me.  "So, how's the diet going?".  I kind of laid there puzzled and then said "fiiiiine..?"   He said, "Well, I just wondered.  I wanted to make sure you haven't given up!".  I had to laugh at that.  Me!? Give UP!?  now THAT'S not happening!

      It's time.  It's time to set some goals, make some plans, get off my @$$ and get MOVING.  I'm tired of being stuck where I am!  I'm tired of saying "someday"... I'm tired this haphazard approach to my life, my health...  I am going to DO something!  I know, I know, you've all heard this from me before.  And yes, I may have to give myself this mental @$$ kicking AGAIN... But for now, I'm going to pretend that this is the last time I'll be saying "This is the last time!"    The good news is that I haven't fallen off of my running program since I got my treadmill (except when I was sick, and I missed two workouts then).  I have a weight program in place (I'll post in further down) and I have an idea of what I would like my nutrition to look like.  The next step is to create a real 'plan'.  and I don't just mean "Monday I will eat..."  I mean a PLAN.  I'm actually going to put some of this project managment stuff that I spent over a year studying and put it to good use!  Yes, yes, looseing weight isn't like building a house or writing code, but there ARE some things that I put to use, and I intend to.   I'll be sure to share it with everyone when I get it all together.  It should be fun and interesting.  I've desided to try a new wieght training program.  Because I'm running alot (and more every week)  I desided it was better if I did a weight training program that was more geared toward the kind of stress I'll be putting on my body as I train for a marathon (did I say I was training for a marthon before?  Well if not before I did now!).  So here's the new plan:  Workout 3 days per week. Rotating between two variations. For balance I’ve decided on an alternating Push/Pull workout, and again for balance I’ve decided that my variation will be to switch the order of the Push/Pull.  Variation 1: Quads: Plie’ Squat 25lbs x 15 (Runners should do what they can to strengthen the vastus medialis www.exrx.net/Muscles/Quadriceps to help in knee tracking and this seems to me to be one of the best squats for targeting that area) 30 seconds – Standing Quad stretch Hamstrings: Straight-let Deadlift 35lbs x 15 30 seconds – Seated Single Leg Hamstring Stretch Chest: Dumbbell Bench Press 20lbs x 15 30 seconds – Doorway Chest Stretch Side Delt: Upright Row ???5lbs x 15 (Maybe, I have shoulder issues that may make this one a no-go) 30 seconds – Side Deltoid Stretch Front Calves Heavy Band x 15 (I’m doing these because they are recommended to rehabilitate my planter fascia) 30 seconds – Kneeling Shin Stretch Back: Bent Row 20lbs x 15 30 seconds – Fixed Bar Back Stretch Tri – Bench Dip x 15 30 seconds – Overhead Triceps Stretch Biceps – Dumbbell Curl 10 x 15 30 seconds – Standing Biceps Stretch Abs and Lower Back – Pilates: The Hundred 10 sets of 10 The Roll Up 5 Reps Single Leg Circles 5 Circles each direction each leg Rolling Like a Ball 8 Reps Single Leg Stretch 8 Sets Double Leg Stretch 8 Sets Single Straight Leg Stretch 8 Sets Double Straight Leg Stretch 8 Sets Criss-Cross 8 Sets Spine Stretch Forward 5 Sets  Variation 2: Same weight, exercise and stretch Hamstrings Quads Back Chest Side Deltoid Biceps Triceps Abs Calves  Week 1: Mon Var 1, Wed Var 2, Fri Var 1 Week 2: Mon Var 2, Wed Var 1, Fri Var 2   I'm doing my first workout tonight and I'm expecting that it will be a REAL kicker...

      So, I've not been here much.  There's a reason.  I SUCK.  Motivation nill - Excercise Mild - and Food can you say BLECK!?  This has GOT to stop!  Every time I look in the mirror I see all the work I need to do and it makes me ill.  So what do I do?  I stop looking in the mirror... But then I went to a party on Saturday, and there was pictures, and there is only so much you can hid from the camera *sigh*.  So I suck...  The good news is that I still have a lot of stamina.  I'm in pretty good 'shape'.  I'm strong, I have endurance, but I'm fat.  The only way to 'fix' this is to do something about all this eating.  It's not just just eating, it's the tons of chocolate and cake and the like.    Not to make excuses, but I HAVE been really depressed of late.  Sticking to any plan of self improvement while questioning your own self worth is difficult.  But I'm better now.  It's time not only to put away the chocolate, but to figure out how to deal with the blues WITHOUT the chocolate.  But, one step at a time... Time to get on plan - a GOOD solid burn the FAT plan.    I'm tired.  I'm tired of belly roles, thigh cellulite, back cleavage, and rolls along the waistband of my control top panty hose.    Damn it!  I know you probably don't want to be reading this.  You're probablly nodding your head and saying "yeah, we've heard this before, how is this time different"  In truth I don't know that this time is differnt.  As a matter of fact, I'm scared to DEATH that this time WON'T be different and I'll be writing this post all over again in a month, but does that mean I roll over and dive into a vat of chocolate?  No - it means that I write this post all over again in a month if I have to and keep trying.  Keep plugging away, and if you get sick of reading it - then I guess you have to go read somewhere else.  But I'm not writing for you - I'm writing for me and that's the way it has to be.... sorry.  No - I'm not sorry!  I'm angry!  I used anger to get myself out of slump emotionally  urlLink  recently  - so why not for this.  I'm doing it!  I'm getting pissed.  ENOUGH is ENOUGH!!  For the rest of the day today I will eat good, healthy clean food.  The plan..  Salad and Tri-Tip for dinner Riccotta cheese for desert  I'll run tonight when I get home...

      I took most of last week off.  I just couldn't find the desire or energy to run.  My nutrition sucked - well not really I barely ate.  Just couldn't find the desire or energy. (seeing a pattern here?)  BUT - the good news is after taking most of last week off, I couldn't WAIT to run yesterday, then ended up holding off because it was a 'rest'day.  So by the time today came around I was really REALLY ready.  And the three miles just FLEW by.  I felt fantastic the entire time!  No dead legs, no cramps.  My foot felt strong.  Everything felt PERFECT.  Best of all I ran the three miles in 37 minutes on the nose!  that's a pace of 12:20 - I'm getting faster!  tomorrow's my cross training bike ride and I'm really looking forward to that too.  Nutrition is going according to my new plan. Maybe that along with the rest is making a difference.  We'll have to see

      Good news first -  The race: We got a much later start out of the house then I wanted. Getting four kids going at 7:00am is a major chore. By the time I arrived (had to drop me off so that they could find parking) the men's race had already started. I checked in, got my number and started milling about. Jogging to warm up, stretching and waiting. Then, the shouting started "Clear the Track!" and the first finishers were coming in. I glanced at the clock and nearly fainted. The first man can in UNDER 17 minutes for 3.1 miles! The rest came in pretty steadily after that with people cheering each other on. It was really heartening to watch.  The ladies lined up after that. I have to admit that I was a little intimidated. After all, this is San Francisco where everyone and their dog runs - literally! There were a TON of long lithe looking women there. But, I filtered to the back of the line and didn't allow myself to think about walking away. After all, how could I? I had paid my $20.  The started everyone with a countdown 10..9.. 8... Since I knew I wasn't in the money or even concerned with placing I didn't get tensed up. I figured I would start when the people in front of my started to clear out. So, I started, jogging along in the back of the pack out to enjoy the day. And it WAS a beautiful day! We don't get many lilke this in SF. The park was the perfect temp. Not too hot, not too cold and the sun was shining (another rarity) There was no wind and everything was dewy and green. The whole first half of the race was uphill and the first mile was really difficult. I managed to keep to MY pace and not kill myself by running too fast (a real fear of mine). The second mile got easier will a few downhills. There was one 'bigger' climb but i just put my head down and bull dogged through it - it really didn't bother my pace at all. What was strange to me was how friendly everyone was! Here I was chugging along and everyone I passed (even those not involved in the race) was at least smiling and nodding, and most were offering a "Keep going! you're doing great!" (though I was under NO delusions). At mile three I was in a groove. I had found a pace that was extremely comfortable for me, though my calves, ankles and hips were starting to feel the effects of running on asphalt. (No twinges from the feet though and that was a GOOD thing). With half a mile to go I heard a little guy on the sidelines tell his mom "She should start going faster now huh mom?" and I wanted to tell him "Sorry sweetie this is as fast as she gets," but I didn't.  If there was one thing that I'm disappointed about regarding this entire race it's that I let myself be afraid. The closer I got to the finish the more afraid I got that I would leg it out too soon and have nothing left to cross the finish line. I wanted to finish with flair. I wanted to finish with a smile not with a wheeze and a gasp. I let pride hold me back, and I hope I don't do that again. I didn't speed up until I could actually SEE the numbers on the clock. I finished with a smile on my face - that's for sure! but I still had a LOT of gas left. I ran without a watch or any other gauge but my body and I liked it that way. Surprisingly I made it in less then the 39 minutes I predicted (I told you I was slow!) and finished in 38:01! That was exciting! I really can't wait to do this again!  As a testament to the caliber of women that were running the race on Sunday. I finished 7th………………… from LAST!  I couldn't even see the next person in front of me!!  It's been 8 weeks since I started running and I can now jog for 3.1 miles and still feel fantastic! I think that was one of the most important parts of the day.. I went 3 miles and didn't fall over.. didn't once durning the run think "OMG can I PLEASE STOP!?" I actually held up my head and enjoyed every moment!! Most important of all, I finished with a smile. A HUGE smile! Even the guys at the gate said something about it... I'm not sure if I can properly express what this meant to me. I finished! And even more amazing.. I started! I followed through on something that for long has only been a pipe dream, and I did it by working toward the goal EVERY day! When I had a bad day I got back on the program and kept on working. I didn't start over, I picked up where I left off and kept going. I just need to apply that same focus to my other goals, and then I'll be finishing a LOT more races!   The bad news:  My weight. I don't know WHAT I've done but I feel terrible. I'm swollen beyond belief and my weight this morning was 189! EEEEK! As if the pictures taken yesterday wern't enough to scare me strait, seeing the scale almost back to 190 certainly did! I've gotten back to a sensible eating plan. Packed my lunch today and I'm sticking to it. Of course PMS has something to do with this feeling and the extra weight but still, I can't let this get out of hand. It's back to full workouts and clean eats!  The Plan:  Here's the plan for the NEXT 8 weeks.  Weight training/stretching Monday and Friday and Sunday  Running Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday  Biking on Wednesday  Hiking or Walking on Sunday

      189 this morning.  The weekend water weight is officially gone!    Today is probably going to be a rough day.  I can hear the candybars calling my name.  This IS day three after all - the point where addictions get worse right before they get better.  I keep doing, as was suggested by a friend, and 'playing the tape through'.  Instead of focusing on the short term enjoyment that may come from something sweet and crunchy (I'm currently jonesing for a Smores Candybar) I'm thinking PAST that pleasure to the shame and dissapointment I'll feel having blown my plans.  I've made a commitment to ME and by god I'll keep it!

      Still taking one day at a time here.  Checking in regarding yesterday and my goals.   Bad News:  Didn't read my book on mastery Good News: I brought it with me to work and started on it at lunch  Bad News: Didn't take pictures Good News: I'm starting a challenge on Monday with a bunch of other ladies and thus am FORCED to take pictures for that  Bad News: Didn't lift weights Good News: Spent the time shopping instead and filled my cupboards up with good foods.  Other Good news:  I stayed on plan the entire day.  I'm now feeling 'DeToxed' and am on a BFL style program today.  I packed my lunch.  Brought REALLY good food to work and I've managed to NOT eat any of the cake that's sitting across the room.  So, as I said, I start an offical challenge (offered by  urlLink Divaquest ) on Monday.  I had to fight a temptation to just throw this week into the trash and say "I'm starting Monday" BUT if I can get a running start into this challenge it will be that much easier and better.  So, I'm sticking to a plan this week.  No 'Do-overs'!  I'm going to run tonight - 3 miles on the table.

      One day at a time folks.  That's where were at here in geekland.  One day at a time.  So far today I've been really good.  I'm in detox.  Going 'induction phase' ah la 'atkins' so that I can stablize my blood sugar and hopefully bash these cravings out of the way.  So far, it's been a sucess.  Weight was back up to 192 this morning, so I'm back to square one, but it's not like I was being 'good' enough to expect progress.  There are a few things I want to do tonight.  1) reread my book on mastery.  I need to wrap my head around some of the concepts in that book again.  2) take pictures.  I've been avoiding looking, and I mean LOOKING at the damage I've been doing.  Hopefully this will do much to motivate me in the days to come.  3) Do weight training.  I haven't picked up a weight in months.  I need it, for my mental as well as physical health.    I need to take my health back.  I need to focus.  I need to stop thinking that I can just do it 'tomorrow'.  Change can and will happen today.  I was the poster child for progress last year.  I've been the poster child for mediocracy since then.  Enough is Enough.

      One victory already today.  I stood in the lunchroom, money in hand, poised above the vending machine and I WALKED away!  I thought, WHY blow it already when just last night I was talking about what a schmuck I was and not sticking to my plan!  YAY me!  First step taken, first hurdle overcome.

      I keep finding myself at this place.  Disgusted with myself for not keeping my promices to myself and to others.  Determined to change, to make it different 'this time'.  So, here I am again.  The good news, I'm actually down from my last weigh in.  190 this morning.  I've been eating crap, but less of it, if that makes sense.  And I've not been a complete slug going on hikes, walks and the like, though not following through on my workouts.  Currently, I want to take it one day at a time and see how it goes.  Tomorrows goals:  Eat clean (6 meals, 1 carb, 1 prot) Drink more (2ltr total) water (this may be why I feel so hungry all the time) Run 2.0 miles Do at least 1 thing that's a step toward any long term goal of mine. Do at least 1 thing that's a step toward crossing something off my 'to-do'list. Come back tomorrow night and report my progress and set goals for tomorrow.  One day at a time folks, that's where I'm at right now.

      I had a GREAT nutrition day yesterday.  Almost exactly 30/30/30 ...  I was a little low in calories, but I wasn't feeling horribly hungry so I think I did alright.  Didn't lift weights but I'm not going to beat myself up over that - every step forward is a good one.  Weight today 189 (whoohoo)  and body fat was at 39%.  The plan tonight - Running 3 miles.    Thanks for the support!

      So, I stood there this morning, looked at myself in the mirror and said "This is it!  We're going to try this again!".  Then I listened... I mean really LISTED to what I was saying and I realized that I can't talk like that.  It's not ok to say "Try again"  I need to say "I'm going to DO this again".  I've done it, I've seen success, all that it takes now is to do it again!  For some WIERD reason it made it all seem a lot easier.  So I 'mentally' signed myself up for another 12 week challenge.  I weighed in, took measurments and I'm even going to take some starting pictures.  The bad news, things are bad - the good news, they aren't as bad as they could be.    Weight: 190.5 Body Fat: 44% Chest: 37.5 Bust: 44 Ribs: 36 Waist: 36 Hips: 46.5 Butt: 44.25 Thigh: 25.75 Calf: 14.75 Arm: 14.5  The Goals for the next 12 weeks: Weight: 170.5 Body Fat: 32% Chest: 35 Bust: 39.75 Ribs: 33.25 Waist: 31.5 Hips: 42.75 Butt: 40.75 Thigh: 23.75 Calf: 14.25 Arm: 14  The Plan?  I'm going back to what works - BFL  What of running?  Well I found that the more and more my milage ramped up, the more I was putting off running, and the more afraid I got that I was going to seriously hurt my foot again.  Running also lead me to totally change my diet, and weight lifting goals, and so far that's done NOTHING good for me.  SO -   Nutritition: goes back to straight, traditional BFL style.  1 carb/1 prot 6 times a day 6 days a week.  One free day.   Weight Workouts: again straight, tranditional BFL style.  I miss workouts that make me feel like I'm getting stronger every day.  I miss flexing in the mirror.    Cardio Workouts: This I'm going to modify slightly.  You see, I still want to run.  I want to race, I just want to take it a LOT slower then I originally planned.  SO - I'm going back to my 5K racing plan (with some modifications).  I'm going to do the milage BFL style and work on building up some speed.  That way when I start working toward the higher milage I'm not looking at running for HOURS... Cross training scheduled on Sundays may be subs for long hikes (we've been known to do some Doozies).  I'll also be posting my intake on Fitday so please feel free to check up on me  urlLink  HERE  and if I'm not posting EMAIL me and ask me WHY!!  parttimemom at that free microsoft email site dot com.  (Or use the link)  You can also check me out at my "Other"  Blog - http://parttimemom.tripod.com/blog/  Last but not least I want to plug the site of my good friend Cory - He's got a GREAT thing going HERE:  http://www.cbevolution.ca/phpbb/index.php  (I'll type more on that later)  I've got a LOT of things I would like to get done tonight, and the only way to get started is to get out of HERE!  Thanks all!

      I ran four miles!  That’s right, me, big ol’ can’t run a mile me, ran four miles!  I can hardly believe it myself.  A really big step.  After this I feel like I can do anything.  For some reason a marathon doesn’t seem nearly as daunting as it once did.  Warped I know, considering that I only ran less then 1/6th of a marathon, but today helped me to realize that I can gradually increase my mileage and continue to improve my endurance.  And that I’m not as incapable of being athletic as I’ve always thought I was.    On the nutrition front.  I know I said I would give it 4 weeks, but high carb just ISN’T doing it for me!  I’m hungry ALL the time and I’m constantly craving stuff.  BAD stuff.  So I’m going to go back to BFL eating for right now, but with a high carb snack after my run (on the days I run).  We’ll see how that goes.  My fiance’ is planning to clean up his diet as well, and that should help me out.  It’s always hard to keep on the straight and narrow when the person across from you is eating whatever they want.  Not that anyone makes food choices and puts them in my mouth but me.  Still, it’s easier.  SO, tomorrow the meal plan is this:  7:00am 2 eggs and an English muffin w/butter 10:00am Hard boiled Egg and ½ an apple 1:00pm Chicken breast, veggies, and pasta 4:00 pm yogurt w/protein powder 7:00 pm Burger and baked potato w/butter and veggies 10:00 pm peanut butter shake  Tomorrow I start weights again.  I will! I will!

      I ran last night!  and it was good! I tried something new brought in a beginners running program that I used to get from walking to running to try to bring my speed up.  First step:  2 minutes at high speed, 4 minutes at a lower speed.  I'm going to do that for my next two runs - then build up time at the higher speed as time progresses - simple!  I'm a little worried about my scale though.  I think it's gone bonkers.  Last night before I weighed 188.5, this morning 190.5 huh?  I gained 2 lbs overnight?  So I grabbed my other scale and stepped on it and IT says that I weigh 185.5 - so now I'm REALLY confused.  Not that I really care about the actual number, I just want to see it going down!  So food has been ok.  No real plan yet but as I said, the goal is to have it in place by the time the weekend is over.  The plan for the weekend is to run on Saturday and hike on Sunday - OR vise-versa. I'm going to do some weight training tonight as well.    Other then that, it's just a matter of trying to keep the eats clean.  Keeping focused.  I've got 5 lbs to lose here!

      Well, I couldn't help myself - I got on the scale again this morning.  Back to 190, but I'm not going to panick. I think my weight's going to be doing that for a while until my body figures out that I'm serious here.  I'm sure things will settle  once I start lifting again too.  I need to put some muscle back on my body.  I'll feel better about it if I do.  No that I'm some week and helpless female.  HA! I just know that the calories burned by muscles will help a LOT.  Plan for tonight is to run 2 miles.  After the hell that was my three mile run on Tuesday, this should be a breeze.  I just have to decide what movie to start as I finished Grifters.  Maybe I'll skip the movie watching and do BFL style intervals again.  That was kind of fun.  In other news I'm doing pretty good mentally.  I'm feeling motivated and postive again.  By the end of the weekend my goal is have a solid nutrition plan and start logging food again.

      So I weighed in today - 188.5  a bit improvement over yesterday!  that gives me a three week goal of 183.5.  Very doable.  I'm toying with not weighing in again until the three weeks are up - One part of my mind says it will keep me from back sliding if I have one really good week.  the other part of my mind says it would be really easy to let things slide without the scale factor to egg me on.  I'm still out there on this one...  Had a clean day today - eating right where i want it to be with no indescretions.  I had to work late AGAIN and this time didn't get home until after 8:00 so.. considering that and the fact that I've excercised four straight days in a row I've decided to NOT workout tonight :)  No excuses - it's an executive decision.   Thanks so much for the comments.  Knowing folks are watching here makes me more apt to post, and knowing I'm expected to post makes me want to do better throughout the day so I don't have to come here and confess my caramel shake!

      I ran!  I think it was the hardest ever!  Not only have I not ran in a week and a half, but I hiked about 12 miles in the past three days and it was HOT today!  I managed to chug through the first mile and a half and then I HAD to take a walk break.  I slowed down a bit and then decided to do intervals for the rest of the run.  WHEW!  I pushed my already tired body to the LIMIT! But it felt great.  I still have to eat dinner, but other then the caramel shake at lunch time I’ve been good.    I got some help from a friend today.  We were supposed to be doing a 12 week challenge together but I slid and didn’t keep up my end of the deal.  She’s continued to check up on me and has been kicking my butt as I asked her to do.  Today she suggested that I set a goal of three clean weeks, and in that three weeks work to lose 5 lbs.  I thought that was a GREAT idea, so that’s the plan.  Weigh in is tomorrow morning!

      Today's been pretty good so far.  OK, except for the carmel milk shake at lunch.  What is WRONG with my head?  I have to work until 7:00 tonight but I'm going to go home and hit the treadmill as soon as I get home.  3 mile run.  It shouldn't be too bad.  Maybe I'll finally get to finish "Grifters".  I've started watching movies while on my 'long' runs and this one I've been working on for a while.  The plan for the rest of the eveing?  I'm going to plan my meals for tomorrow and make sure I have lunches packed.  I'm going to try again with the 'running' nutrition - eating carbs throughout the day and then having a serving of protien with dinner.  I'm going to give it four weeks.  And then reevaluate.  I know that I can't keep letting things go the way they are or next thing I know I'll be 200+ again!    One other thing I'm going to do tonight is re-read my book on mastery.  It was so inspiring to me the first time around, maybe it will help to motivate me to keep on track again.  Another change I'm going to make is to switch back to a BFL weight lifting scheme.  I miss watching my muscles grow!  I want to be proud of my back again... Again, I'll give it four weeks and see how it effects my running.  So, on June 29th look for me to put up an evaluation.  Alright, nose to the grindstone.  I want to be that chick at the office that everyone looks up to again!

      Life never turns out as we would expect.  After my last post I was full of piss and vinager.  Then I realized I was going to have to work until 9:00pm!  This meant dinner from the store and no run!  But!  I did turn the nutrition around for the rest of the week.  I never got back on my running program (That will happen tonight) but I did get some great excercise in.  Saturday 6-8 mile hike, Sunday 2-3 mile hike, Monday 4 mile hike.  All vigerous and all up and down hills!  And we had a blast at the same time.  Weight today - 192!!!  Eeeeek!  I can't believe this is happening!  I'll be planning good solid nutrition for the rest of the week!  And post more often to keep myself accountable.

      I don't know what to do  I've tried being excited, getting angery, sad... taking a day at a time, planning 12 weeks, looking forward a year...  Still I struggle, and feel as if I'm running in a hamster wheel - getting nowhere.  Part of myewants to take everything I've been trying to do and throw it out the window and find a whole new approach.  Yes, I'm talking about the BFL lifestyle - It's not that it doesn't work.  I know it does, but somehow, I'm broken... at least it feels that way.  But then the other part of me says "It works if you do it... you just need to do it!  Don't quit, don't be a failure!"    What am I working against here?   1) an addiction.  As Jay said, a destructive behavior that I recognize, but don't seem to be able to do anything about.  At least not for large periods of time.  I do it for a while.  Usually only if I'm super stict- then I start getting obsessive about being strict and the next thing I know I'm starving myself.  Not Good.  It's not emotional eating.  It's not hunger.  Those don't drive me to eat.  But it's the sheer PLEASURE of eating.  I love food.  I love the taste and the variety.  I love cooking it and eating it.  and the more I focus on it, the worse it seems to get!  It's Glutony pure and simple!  So, what do I do?  Do I pick up the pieces and plow on?  Spend hours planning meals, focusing on what's 'good' and 'bad' and continue to give food power?  I'm just so FRUSTRATED!  Here's what I'm SERIOUSLY consitering...Returning to Weigh down.  For those of you who don't know what that is, it's a christian weight loss program that tries to 'cure' you of your food addiction.  Helping you recognize hunger and eat in accordiance with your bodies needs.  It also strips foods of thier power.  There is NO 'Good' or 'Bad' food.  Everythings allowed as long as your are hungry when you eat it and you stop when you are full.  Sounds simple, but it's not.  But taking away food's power over me.  It's ability to make me FEEL as though I'm worthy or unworthy... I may need to go back to that.  2) Lazyness - That's the only reason I can give for constantly skipping workouts.  I'm not ill.  I've got a lot of time.  I'm reletively healthy, but do I do what I should?  No!  It's like that law you learned in science class... an object at rest tends to stay at rest.. that's me a big ol' resting object.  Wanting to be healthy isn't enough of a motivator, and as I said before all those other emotions haven't changed anything either.  I need some purpose.  Some good and valid reason to workout.  The only idea I've had so far is to join a dance class.  Returning to Ballet... Perhaps THAT would motivate me... I dunno... At the moment I'm stuck and I'm at the end of my rope.  But maybe that's not an entirely bad thing.  maybe what I need to do is let go?

       urlLink  This weekend we go on our annual weekend trip with my company. I SO had visions of wowing everyone this year, and instead, I'm only about 10 lbs lighter then last year's trip. BAH!  And I'm sitting here having to walk past PILES of paistries each time I run to the bathroom...  I just want to go home and curl up in a dark room right now.. really.

      *groan*  Friday it started, an ice cream and some cookies - and then it continued - Monday I was thinking.&nbsp; This will start on Tuesday, I'm going back to work.&nbsp; Then I walk into work and remembered it was someone's 40th birthday and they had brought in every breakfast no-no known to man, and I continued to graze.&nbsp; I think it may have just stopped when 10 minutes ago, while eating cake, I realized that I was moments from making myself sick!  Why do i do this?&nbsp; How does it go so far so fast.&nbsp; How can I stand there poping doughnuts the whole while hating the way I feel in my clothes?&nbsp; I don't understand the mentality and it's ME doing it!  I'm a food adict.&nbsp; I know this.. I known it for a while.&nbsp; What I haven't figured out is how to get over it.&nbsp; The only way for me to do this seems to be cold turkey, but then the body's not designed to go without food - so I'm left having to monitor myself.&nbsp; ARG.. this is all so frustrating and currently so completely depressing.  No - I'm NOT giving up.&nbsp; I'll continue to bang my head against this brick wall until SOMETHING gives.&nbsp; Hopefully it's not my head!  I'm going to run tonight - 2 miles - hopefully my sluggishness will be gone by then.&nbsp; And I'm going to do better.&nbsp; No, not tomorrow, but here and now.&nbsp; There is no reason why I can't make the rest of today count...  &nbsp;

      Alright, I’ve been away for a few days so I’ll try to catch you up.  Wednesday, I came home so tired! I dropped on the couch as soon as I got home and didn’t move for the rest of the night. Literally. I didn’t even cook dinner! Instead my fiancé made me a PB&amp;J Sandwich. Not exactly the ginger chicken I had planned, but not terribly bad either. I was also so tired I didn’t plan the next day. Bad mistake because it was a day in desperate need of planning!  Thursday I had an all day meeting. (These happen once a quarter of so). I knew lunch was provided so I would be stuck eating pretty much what they provided. I needed to be to work early too and this limited my breakfast prep time. Breakfast ended up being a bagel with PB on in. On the way into work I picked up and then snacked on an energy bar because I knew it would be a LONG time ‘til lunch. If I only knew HOW long! We finally took a break at 1:00pm. I was so hungry I had a headache and was shaking. Times like that are REALLY dangerous for me because the urge to get sugar to the blood stream FAST is almost too much. Cravings for candy bars were almost overcome by cravings for burgers and fries when I walked past Burger King, but I resisted and forced myself to visit Subway instead (one of my LEAST favorite fast food places). A turkey sandwich and baked lays later and I was feeling a bit better. I went past the Wallgreens and picked up another energy bar for later, and ended up eating it before end of the lunch hour. By the time I got home I was exhausted and STARVING. I grabbed a cheese stick and went to bed. I was feeling a little better after a short nap, but not a lot. Dinner was a NICE healthy blackened chicken (ping me if you want the recipe) and rice.. YUM!  Today I woke up and it was OBVIOUS by the way I was feeling that I haven’t been eating enough. I was week and shaky and my stomach was so upset that I thought I was going to hurl. All symptoms I recognize. So, I had a serving of beef jerky and a bagel. Waited about an hour– still feeling crap. Had scrambled eggs and toast. A little better, but still feeling hollow about an hour later, so I had a energy bar to top it all off. Much MUCH better now! As much as I HATE tracking my food if this happens again I’m going to start doing it. It’s just much much too easy for me to eat less and less every day until I’m worn out and eating too too little.  In other news, the scale said 185.5 this morning.  Das ist Gute…  OH! And what is today? Friday? My arms still hurt SO BAD! Well not really my arms, but my chest! I’m not sure another upper body workout is in a works, but if not, I think I’ll run and make up yesterday’s missed workout.   Still in this thing!

         Last night at  urlLink Divaquest   urlLink Bisous  asked us “Do people have parts of their bodies they are really proud of? Kickin' biceps, awesome shins? Quads of steel?” And that got me thinking.    Of course my first response was “I have nice cleavage”, but that was HARDLY appropriate for a fitness board.  The other thoughts that followed weren’t very apropos either, “I have nice hands.”, “I really like my feet”.I really had to THINK about it!   I’m pretty proud of my biceps, but only when compared to the rest of my body. When you hold them up to someone like  urlLink Skwigg  well, let’s just say I haven’t much to brag about. Same goes for my back/shoulders.   Somehow there’s a part of me that feels this is VERY VERY wrong. Shouldn’t there be SOMETHING of mine, that I’ve created, sculpted, worked for that I’m willing to show to the world?   Truth is, right now – NO.

      I know it's late, but I wanted to check in before the day was through -  How did I do?&nbsp; Let's see: Drink water? Started - will finish in the 15 minutes before I hit the bed Eat on Plan?&nbsp; check! Training Run?&nbsp; 2 miles! check (kicked my butt it did) Vits?&nbsp; Umm... I guess I should do that now -but hate to sleep with that stuff in my tummy  I did 1/2 of my "things for others"&nbsp; 50% hmm  And for tomorrow? Drink 48oz of water Lower Body baby! and with the new barbell - cool! Eat on Plan (see plan below) and let's try to get those vitamins in shall we?  Things to do for others? Bug my coworker about working out again (shame him if I have to) Ask someone to walk with me at lunch? (Ick)  What did I do well today? I ate on plan! yippy (passed up cookies and naco wafers) I ran even when I didn't want to  I drank water while running (thus giving me an early start)  What could I do better? Drink EARLIER (even more so)  Food Plan: B - Blueberry pancakes S - Power Muffin (it's the last of those) L - Leftover chicken from tonight S - Yogurt and fruit and PP (I'm liking this can you tell?) D - Ginger Chicken with rice S - shake (maybe - I've been skipping and feeling fine)  Workout: Lower Body! yay (I'm trying to look forward to it&nbsp; LB is my LEAST favorite day)  Alright, I'm ready to face tomorrow now!  &nbsp;

      When I got home, I was tired.&nbsp; Not just tired, but TIRED.&nbsp; I wanted to just curl up on the couch and not more again ‘til morning.&nbsp; I tried to justify sitting there for ‘just an hour’.&nbsp; But I knew, if I gave myself a hour to sit, that it would turn into two hours, and that it would get harder and harder to get up the longer I sat.&nbsp; So, I didn’t sit.&nbsp; I got up and changed my clothes and ran.&nbsp; And you know what? I feel TONS better now that I did!  &nbsp;  Time to make dinner.

      As I said last nigh,t yesterday was perfect food, water, excercise.  It all worked out.    I woke up this morning KNOWING it had been a good day.  I couldn't roll over because my abs and legs were hurting from the bent rows.  I'm really glad I chose to skip the tris and bis last night because if I was any more sore then I am right now, I would be incompasitated.    Weight: 186.5 (Ok, even _I_ am saying "Huh?" about this)  Mood: VERY VERY good    Status so far:  On plan - YAY!

      Meals and workout are planned for tomorrow.&nbsp; All I have left for today's goals is to drink my water.&nbsp; Hmm, guess I better get up and get a glass!... &nbsp; There - Now I'm sitting here with 32oz of water beside me.&nbsp; No excuses! &nbsp; So, tomorrow's goals: &nbsp; Drink 40oz of water Do my training run!&nbsp; (someone want to send the 'no excusses' fairy over to my house?) Eat what's on my plan, nothing more! Try taking a vitamine or two? &nbsp; Two things I'll do for others: Make lunch for my honey: (Done) Give (someone who I'll not name here) the weightloss book to read &nbsp; Three things I did well today: Ate on plan!&nbsp; Like SO on plan - passed up all the crap at the store.&nbsp; Didn't eat any of the cookies that are in the cupboard.&nbsp; I just had a GOLDEN day. Did my workout.&nbsp; Worked my weenie arms until they were BEGGING for mercy went for a walk.&nbsp; Even though my plan didn't call for it, a few extra steps never hurt anyone! &nbsp; One thing I could do better: Spread my water out over the day instead of putting it off until 9:00pm! &nbsp; Food Plan: Breakfast - Oatmeal Pancakes Snack - Power Muffins Lunch - chicken Quesedilla Snack - Yogurt, fruit, and Protien Powder Dinner - Chicken Parmisian Snack - Shake &nbsp; Workout: A run on the treadmill (2 miles) First 20 minutes BFL style intervals. &nbsp; There! Everythings all planned out for tomorrow - that feels GOOD!

      I think it’s a pretty good sign when you finish your workout and can’t lift your water bottle to get a drink when your done!  &nbsp;  Yeah, I had a good workout.&nbsp; First off because I did it, secondly because I did it with the wholehearted support of the one I love, and last but not least, because I put 100% into it and I am TOAST!&nbsp; Can you say noodle arms?  &nbsp;  It didn’t start out so great.&nbsp; I opened up my new barbell; all excited about using it for the first time, and realized that it was missing the collars that were supposed to come with it!&nbsp; Just that little set back had me thinking twice about working out, but my honey wouldn’t let me get off that easily.&nbsp; I borrowed the collars from my dumbbells and forged ahead!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  First was chest.&nbsp; Bench press (on the swissball)  55lbs x 12  I don’t know what I was thinking.&nbsp; I loaded the bar WAY too heavy. Barely finished the 12, so I left the weight the same for the next set.  55 x 10  Still heavy!  55 x 8  Almost OK so I bumped the weight for the next set  60 x 6  then  55x12  YEAH!  Bench Flyes  15 (each) x 12  That was a 10.5!  &nbsp;  Next, Shoulders – Upright rows  10lbs x 12  15 x 10  20 x 8  25 x 6  20 x 12  all too easy – need to up by 5 lbs next time  Lateral Flye  2 lbs x 12  WAY too easy – maybe 3lbs next time?  &nbsp;  Next Back – Bent Row  40lbs x 12  45 x 10  50 x 8  55 x 6  It was really getting hard so I dumped more weight then I normally would for the final set  45 x 12  Bent Flye  5lbs x 12  too easy – need to be heavier next time – maybe 7.5  &nbsp;  I skipped biceps and triceps this time – My arms were already toast from the previous exercises.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I just have two more meals to eat and I’m finished for the day!&nbsp; AND it’s been PERFECT!! Wooo Hooo!

      Alright - I'm flooding the airwaves with posts - but that's just how motivated I am today. &nbsp; Goals: &nbsp; in twelve weeks I will: &nbsp; lose 20 lbs drop 2.5 off my chest drop 2.75 off my ribs drop 4.5 off my waist drop 3.75 off my Hips drop 3.5 off my butt drop 2 off each thigh drop .5 off each upper arm drop .5 off each calf &nbsp; I will drop 12% off my body fat. &nbsp; Currently I am 190 lbs at 46.9% Body fat &nbsp; In twelve weeks I will be 170 pounds and 34.9% &nbsp; &nbsp; To achive this goal in the next four weeks I will: &nbsp; lose 6.67 lbs drop 4% body fat drop .83 off my chest drop .92 off my ribs drop 1.5 off my waist drop 1.25 off my hips drop 1.17 off my butt drop .67 off each thigh drop .17 off each calf drop .17 off each upper arm &nbsp; In four weeks I will weigh 183.3 lbs and be at 42.9% body fat. &nbsp; How will I do this?&nbsp;  &nbsp; I will plan and eat BFL sytle meals 6 days a week.&nbsp;  Free days are on Sundays - no exceptions I will workout 6 days a week.&nbsp; Weight Training Mon/Wed/Fri Running Tue/Thu/Sat&nbsp; Sundays are a rest day.&nbsp;  If I miss a workout I will make it up on Sunday but these occurances will be rare I will drink water during the day.&nbsp; Starting with 32oz today and adding 8 oz a day until I reach a minimum of 1/2 my body weight (currently that would be 94oz) I will journal what I eat and why as this was a big help in getting my focus in my first successful BFL challenge. I will love myself enough to treat my body to the best foods and excercise. &nbsp; IF I honor my self promices for six weeks I will buy a chin up bar to add to my home gym. &nbsp; ToDo: Come up with a reward list Create a food journal ----There's more I'm sure so I'll add to this as I think of it.

      Holey Cow!&nbsp; No wonder it looks as if I've gotten my 'linebacker' back - back.&nbsp; I've put 2 inches back on my chest measurement, 2 on my rib measurement and I'm back to a 38" waist!&nbsp; Ick! Ick! Ick!&nbsp; Something Must be done, and I'm doing it!

      GOD, I'm glad that's over with!&nbsp; here's my thoughts &nbsp; 1 - it could be worse. a LOT worse - in fact, it's BEEN worse  2 - it's obvious that a greater percentage of my weight gain has been (as I suspected) in my bust area.&nbsp;  3 - My 'linebacker' back has returned - this MUST be taken care up 4 - What happened to my bicepts? &nbsp; I'll take and post photos again in 4 weeks.&nbsp; I'm also going to take a few pictures in 'regular' clothes so that I can get a visual there as well, but I won't put you all through the pain of posting them :) &nbsp; I'm actually kind of excited.&nbsp; It's going to be fun to do this again in four weeks if I really stick to my guns.&nbsp; Maybe having these photos up here will help...

      Alright,&nbsp; I come, I go.&nbsp; I start, I restart.&nbsp; About the only thing positive I can say about myself is that I don't give up!&nbsp; HA! &nbsp; Last week was abismal.&nbsp; In fact, I even wrote a post about how abismal Thursday was, and it was so bad the internet ate it!&nbsp; let's just say that my day's menues consisted of, B-Cupcakes, L-Cookies, D-Bizzard from DQ.&nbsp; Yeah, real adult don't you think?&nbsp; The only positive thing I can think to say is that I lived to tell about it!&nbsp; I didn't even have PMS to blame for THAT one. &nbsp; Todays GOOD news?&nbsp; I actually have my menu planned and my lunches packed.&nbsp; All my food is ready to go, and that's&nbsp;a BIG step for me.&nbsp; Also, I bought a barbell (to go with my dumbbells) and I'm so excited to use it that I should have no problem getting my workout in.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Weight 190 - &nbsp; Goals:&nbsp; Eat what I planned, nothing more,&nbsp; Do an upper body workout, Drink 32oz of water, Plan tomorrow's meals &nbsp; I also need to do my measurements so I can baseline my progress.&nbsp; I actually signed up for the BFL challenge today and so, I may as well START today.&nbsp; measurements and pictures - gah this is seeming so - official now ;)

      Yesterday was one of those days.  One of those days that I need to have less of, and talk about more.  Talk about only so I can figure it out and keep it from happening again...  It was one of those days where I revert to my childhood fanticies and eat everything I dreamed about as a kids eating as an adult.  *sigh* and I didn't even have PMS to blame for it all.  So, are you ready?  I can see the horror dawning in your eyes.  You have these visions and the reality could turn out to be much worse or much better then what you are imagining.    Breakfast - happened about 2:00 in the afternoon.  I had slept until noon.  It was on the run, I had to be someplace....  I ate two hostess yellow cake cupcakes.    Lunch - a few moments later.  I was still hungry of course, and the sugar had just started to take a hold of my blood stream... what better then add to the mix.  Strawberry filled and Lemon filled cookies  (This was my fruit serving for the day).  Oh and the stripped shortbread cookies too.  (Does it count as food because it had the word BREAD in it?)    Dinner - again on the run.  I was going to just get a soda while going through the drive through, but I had a few dollars in my pocket and it WAS Dairy Queen... a chocolate chip cookie blizzard somehow ended up in the car with me, and from there in my mouth... (HA it was dairy - right?)    and that was it!  Writing it makes me want to hurl.  I can't belive I ate such CRAP.  No wonder I feel swollen and sluggish today.  I should feel worse about then I do though.  For some reason the childish side of me is a little smug at eating all that and getting away with it.  After all, who's going to tell me no?      The rest of this week WILL be better.  Saturday I'm going to plan my meals for the next week and Sunday do all the shopping, so next week is going to be steller.  If only I could find a way to harnes the power of that little brat who made me eat ice cream for good instead of evil!

      I know what you're thinking!  Yeah, I hear ya... "She's fallen off the wagon again..."  "She's probably 10 lbs heavier by now.."  BUT, guess what!  I've actually been doing well.  I've just been busy as hell! heheheh.  Weight today 186.5  (BooYA!)  I even did a BFL style leg workout last night! Yeah Yeah Yeah!  I haven't been 100% but I've been 95% at least and getting a lot of 'incedental'  excercise.  Hiking, walking, housework, that sort of stuff.  It's all good!  This week I'm going to try to focus on a structured workout routine and get back into the habit of lifting weights.  I'm seeing some small changes here, starting to get excited, and I'll do my best to keep you informed!
