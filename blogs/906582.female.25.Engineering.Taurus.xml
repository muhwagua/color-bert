       100 Things About Me . . .    Inspired by the blogs I've been reading lately:  1.  I have my very first brand new car (a 2003 blue Honda Civic coupe). . . duh! =)  2.  I wish I had more doodads at home . . . a digital camera would be cool!  3.  I have 2 black cats, Tigger and Jazz.  Tigger is a snob, Jazz is a pig.  But I love them both.  4.  I have 3 younger brothers, and we're all almost exactly 2 years apart.  Who says the rhythm method doesn't work? =)  5.  I enjoy my job as a petroleum technologist.  6.  I wish I could have the best of both worlds, and get paid for learning instead of the other way around.  7.  I once had a hamster named Webster.  He died of asthma, or at least died wheezing.  8.  I once had a hamster named Fluffy.  She died of a tumor.  Hamsters aren't very good pets. =(  9.  I lived on West Timor Island, Indonesia for 8 months when I was 15 (with my family, of course).  10.  I was in French immersion until grade 7.  11.  I was incredibly shy as a child, and still am with strangers.  12.  I never had an imaginary friend.  13.  I wanted to be a vet when I was younger.  14.  I also wanted to be an astronaut . . .   15.  I wanted to be a geneticist when I was in high school.  OK, that's a 100-list in itself . . . =)  16.  I hate wearing glasses, and wear contacts unless I absolutely physically cannot (like this week).  17.  My parents are divorced, and one is remarried.  18.  I never want to get divorced.  19.  I was engaged shortly before 20, unengaged shortly after 21.  20.  I love sleeping in.  21.  Summer is my favorite season, and I hate having to work through it.  22.  I hated being unemployed this past summer (go figure *L*).  23.  I hate waiting.  24.  I have all 10 fingers and toes.  25.  If my mum gets remarried to someone with a last name that starts with a C, her initials will be ABC.  26.  I love to swim.  27.  If I have children, they'll learn to swim before they walk.  28.  I set several provincial swimming records when I was younger.  29.  Most have been broken by now.  What the hell do they feed kids these days?!  30.  I have strawberry blonde hair, and always wish it was redder.  31.  My grandpa always compliments my hair.  I love my grandpa. =)  32.  I love sincere compliments that come out of the blue.  33.  I once had a cruch on Jonathan Brandis when I was in junior high.  34.  I am convinced that I had an online fling with Ethan Embry, though some part of me will always wonder if it really was him, or some sap with too much time on his hands.  35.  I used to be a net addict.  36.  I'm not a cyber-virgin, but it's not something I'd do again.  It's actually kind of sad.  37.  I prefer the real thing. =)  38.  I would eventually like to be a member of the Mile High club.  Just to say I did it.  39.  I like my coffee from Tim Hortons, with 2 cream and one sugar.  40.  I usually add another sugar cube when I get to work.  41.  I once ran away from home.  I honestly thought it would be one less thing for my parents to worry about if I wasn't around.  I think I was 13 or 14.  42.  My father doesn't talk to me anymore (unrelated to 41, as far as I know).  43.  I have moved 6 times since I was 18, and am about to move twice more in the next couple of months.  44.  I don't like moving.  45.  I find routines reassuring and stifling all at once. =)  46.  I don't fix into a box (figuratively . . . I could, literally, if it was big enough).  47.  I like to know the big picture before I'm told details or individual steps.  48.  I think Sean Connery was and will always be the best James Bond.  49.  I think Vin Diesel is pretty awesome eye candy.  50.  My hair almost reached my butt when I was 8 years old.  51.  I sometimes miss how my mum used to brush my hair and play with it when I was young.  52.  Sometimes I'm glad I never had a sister.  53.  Sometimes I'm sad that I never had a sister.  54.  I know that "baca" means both "read" and "boyfriend" in Indonesian.  55.  I love filtered/bottled water.  Tap water tastes funny.  56.  I still eat KD.  57.  I still eat PB&J sandwiches from time to time (today, actually!)  58.  I am not terribly good at keeping friends.  There are many from my childhood that I wish I had kept in touch with.  59.  My very first boyfriend's name was Peter.  We grossed everyone out by holding hands on the school bus.  I was in grade 3.  60.  I never kissed a boy until the summer after I graduated high school.  61.  I was no longer a virgin less than a year later.  62.  I can count on one hand the number of men I've "been with".  Just so you don't get the wrong impression. =)  63.  I try not to judge people by their covers.  64.  I would be lost without post-it notes . . . the saying "You'd forget your head at home in the morning if it wasn't attached" is quite accurate with me.  65.  My parents always said "buggy" instead of shopping cart.  So do I.  People think I'm weird.  I think it's different.  And different is good.  66.  I don't call it a boot (trunk), lift (elevator), or trousers (pants) . . . but I love Bristol-speak.  67.  I have cool cousins over in England, but I've only met 2 of them (and an aunt and uncle).  68.  I want to travel more.  69.  Apart from never having money, I loved being a student.  70.  I like having money - enough to be comfortable.  But really, is there ever "enough" for the average person?  71.  I am sometimes guilty of seeing material possessions as a sign of success and status.  72.  I love my boyfriend.  73.  I love my family.  74.  I don't see my family often enough, especially my Papa.  75.  I have never heard my Papa say a single bad thing about my Nana.  He comes just shy of worshipping her and her memory . . . I wish more couples were like that these days.  76.  I was baptized Roman Catholic as a baby.  77.  I don't go to church . . . sadly, not even on special occasions.    78.  I do not look highly on "holiday worshippers" who call themselves religious people.  79.  My favorite colors are blue and dark green.  80.  I hate yellow, period.  Unless it's a sunny day.  That's the only thing that should be yellow.  81.  I am pro-choice.  I don't think other people should have the right to tell a person what to do with his/her life.  82.  I do not enjoy answering the phone at work.  At home is a different story.  83.  I get frustrated when I don't know the answer to a question.  84.  I can be very impatient sometimes (no kidding - I couldn't wait a week for my car!)  85.  I think the 80s was a great time to be growing up.  Kids these days grow up way too fast.  86.  I think cloning humans is immoral and just a bad idea in general.  Nothing good could come of it.  87.  I believe in guardian angels - my Nana and Uncle Aidan keep very busy looking out for my family and I.  88.  I don't disbelieve in ghosts, reincarnation, and aliens.  89.  I believe there is a God, but that's about as detailed as I'm often willing to go about my religious beliefs.  Give me a drink or two, and that might change though. =)  90.  I think most people are essentially good, but there are always bad seeds.  91.  I believe evil does exist.  How can you have one without the other? =)  92.  I love writing for personal use - journals, blogs, etc.  Otherwise, I'm not terribly creative.  93.  I have been told I have excellent technical writing skills.  94.  I used to play and teach the piano.  I hope to re-acquaint myself with it again one day.  95.  I'm an excellent speller.  I wish we had spelling bees and competitions when I was in grade school.  96.  My mum once had to speed from a swimming competition in one city to a musical awards ceremony in our hometown so I could attend both events.  I was barely 10 years old, and at the top of my game. =)  97.  I can do anything I put my mind to - the trick is sticking with it. =)  98.  I love going to the gym and working out, but I also love my "down time".  99.  I believe people are only victims if they allow themselves to be.  100.  I think it's time to go home now! =)

       Awww . . .  Christmas season is over, and  NOW  the snow comes!   That was awfully disappointing  - not getting a white Christmas.  Add that in with the late (and sparse) shopping and no decorations at home . . . it just didn't quite feel much like Christmas this year.  Well, there's always next year to look forward to. =)   And now it's back to the grind.   Sort of.  One full day today, a half day tomorrow, then Wednesday will be spent nursing a hangover, I'm sure . . . and back to work again on Thursday and Friday.  The most frustrating part is I have work that needs to get done, but I can't do much without getting information from other people, and they're all off on holidays!  Not to mention that I've been expected to handle all the phone calls for the last week (and this week), and well as keep track of who's here and who's not (for the purpose of transferring calls, as not everyone has their voice mail set up).  Sometimes I wonder how we actually make money, things are so disorganized around here . . . =)   But enough about work . . .  I'm going to babble about my car now! =)   Yes, I finally got it.   I was immensely disappointed when I realized I wouldn't get it in time for Christmas.  But no worries - the time passed by quickly enough.  The day I went to pick it up was so busy!  It took an hour and a half to get all the paperwork straight and finally drive away.  Then I had to drop off the car I'd been borrowing for the last 2 weeks, which was almost across the city.  Since I wasn't comfortable driving in traffic (OK, driving at all), my boyfriend had the pleasure of being its first driver.  And he was quite impressed . . . it's only a little  115-hp Civic engine , but it's pretty peppy.  And decently roomy, too. =)  So on with the story . . . You'll remember (or did I mention it?) that I bought a  5-speed  when all I've ever driven is an automatic.  I've always wanted to know how to drive one, and I figured this would be a good way to force me to learn.  Yes, I'm warped. =)  Anyways, I decided I was more comfortable practicing in the neighbourhood around his place, since it was more familiar.  So we drove back across the city and spent the next hour or so with me creeping around and trying to avoid traffic. =)  The few times someone came up behind me, or that I was faced with traffic when turning, I'd panic.  Especially with someone behind me.  I was still very slow at starting from a dead stop, which meant if there was any sort of slope to the road, I'd be rolling backwards until I got going.  But it didn't take me long to feel where the clutch engaged (or is it disengaged?), so I got a little quicker at that.   After a couple of missteps,  I decided I needed a break to try and steady my nerves.  Sadly, I never went out again because we had places to go and I still didn't want to drive in regular traffic.   Then Sunday rolled around,  with it's foot of fresh snow.  I was happy about finally getting snow, but not that I'd have to worry about winter driving on top of still learning to drive a stick.  So my boyfriend drove us around town again. =)  Went to see Lord of the Rings . . . good movie.  I couldn't believe how packed the theatre was, considering it was 11:30 on a Sunday morning, and there'd been a foot of snow.  But we got there early enough, and it was a pretty good movie.  After all was said and done, I didn't do any more driving, which made me a little nervous, since I'd be driving myself to work the next morning.   Well, as you can tell, I obviously made it to work in one piece. =)   Only one stall (after I nearly rear-ended someone - yikes!), from which I recovered quite nicely.  I won't mention that the drive to work is barely 5km. =)  I had  jello legs  by the time I got to work, but I'm here. =)  I think at lunch, I'm going to make the trip to and from again, just to get in the practice.     Ohhhh . . .  too many people are calling this morning!   Now there's just New Years',  and then the most-hyped holiday season of the year will be over.  That's OK though, cuz there will be plenty for me to look forward to in the new year . . . =)

      I hope everyone had a  wonderful Christmas! =)   I know it's been my best one in quite a few years . . .    Busy though!   My boyfriend has a huge family compared to mine, and they're all quite close.  So the first stop on Christmas Eve was his father's.  After a couple hours of noshing and visiting and opening a few presents (I couldn't believe there were two for me there!), it was off to one of his aunt's for more noshing and visiting.  It was actually a good thing that there wasn't an entire meal at either stop.  I don't think I would have made it home without exploding if there was! =)  But it was great visiting with so many people.   Christmas morning  saw us back at his aunt's for breakfast - but not before opening our stockings for each other. =)  After breakfast was a visit with his mum and more presents!  And finally it was time to visit my family.  Luckily, they were all gathered at my mum's, so it only involved one stop. =)  I was frantically wrapping presents at the last minute, and even attaching name cards after I got there.  So there was yet another round of presents.  I got so many cool things this year, and things I really want & need!  I'm so lucky . . . I also got to see my grandpa and aunt and uncle, whom I love to see, but rarely make the effort to visit during the year.   I just can't wait until next year.   I'm determined that next year I'll be able to do more Christmas shopping, and have the time and/or resources to help out those less fortunate as well.  I have fond memories from my teenage years of taking home paper angels from the Christmas tree at Church, and buying gifts for the people on the angel.  I also had great fun "shopping" in the church hall, filling boxes according to family size for those would have a hard time feeding themselves and their children over the holidays.  Whenever I'm tempted to think I'm having a rough time, I remember doing those things, and the unspeakable gratitude in the eyes of the people who received something as simple as a box full of food.  And suddenly I feel incredibly blessed. =)

       Finally, a productive weekend . . .    Saturday finally saw me  Christmas shopping  at 9:30 in the morning.  I'm glad I went early, even though it meant yet another weekend without sleeping in.  The mall was empty for the most part, and I was done within an hour and a half.  I'm sure I'll be doing a few last-minute things tonight or tomorrow, but that's OK - the most important stuff is done.   And I bought a car on Saturday!!!!   I don't actually have it yet, because it wasn't in stock.  But hopefully before Christmas, at the latest within a week.  I bought myself a trusty old Honda Civic.  Well, not old - a 2003, to be exact.  With some of the nicer doodads (power windows, CD player, keyless entry, A/C, etc), but not the fully loaded version.  My boyfriend was actually very impressed with me - after a week of watching me take all the salesmen's pitches and crap and being spineless, he was quite shocked when I started pushing this last salesman around. =)  I felt kinda bad, but after the week I had, I wasn't about to put up with anymore bull.  I knew what I wanted, how much I wanted to pay for it, and that I wanted it ASAP.  He'll be getting a very nice Christmas card from me.  =)  Sunday was  Christmas brunch  with a few friends.  Good eats and good company. =)  It was sad that a few people couldn't make it, but with it being so close to Christmas, that's to be expected.  Everyone's got family obligations this time of year.   I can't believe  it's a New Year in just over a week . . . I know it'll hold some interesting (and hopefully good!) times . . .

       It has been a long week.   I'm looking forward to the break over Christmas.   So many big issues to deal with at once.   Well, big for me, anyways.  And the cars are only part of it.  I read other peoples' blogs lately, and feel ashamed that something that is essentially a material issue has taken on such importance in my life.  There are far worse things I could be dealing with.   I'm looking forward  to seeing my family over Christmas.  Another thing I'm ashamed of - all my mum's family (except for an uncle I haven't seen since I was a child) lives in the same city as me.  Two aunts and their husbands, and more recently, my grandpa.  And apart from when my mum was in the hospital over the summer and at Christmas, I really don't see them at all.  It's not that I can't stand them . . . I'd love to see them more often.  I just don't make it a priority.  Sometimes I can be a very selfish and self-centered person . . .   Well, I'd better find a more cheery note on which to finish this entry . . .    It's Friday! =)   We're off at noon to have a little Christmas party, we're getting bonusses after all, which means I can actually afford to do my meager Christmas shopping after all.  Everything else will work itself out. =)

       More car stories for today . . .     Yesterday was the "big night".   I went out in the evening with the intention of buying, and hopefully driving something new by the weekend.   I was a tad sidetracked.   At work, I was told that the company had fleet deals through a certain dealership, so I decided it wouldn't hurt to visit there first.  Might as well see if fleet deals would get me a better price.  An hour and a half later - and only a half hour before my original dealership would close - I left empty handed, frustrated, and confused.  I will never deal with them again.  The salesmen had tried to sell me a Pontiac when I wanted a Chevy, a GT (most expensive package, for those who aren't car-savvy) when I was pretty sure all I could afford was  maybe  an upgraded base model, and wouldn't talk numbers until I'd been there for an hour.  I went in knowing what my price range was, and the first numbers he gave me were over $100 more.  He wasted my time.  So I sped back to my original Chevy dealership in the hopes that my salesman would still deal with me.   He gave me a better deal  without much/any haggling from me, and without me even mentioning "fleet pricing".  He knew my price range, and while I'd decided I wanted more bells and whistles, was doing his best to accomodate what I wanted.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel comfortable signing that night.  I wanted the upgrade package, but wanted to double-check if I could afford it.  So he offered to round up a base and an upgraded model for me the next day so I could physically see what it was I was buying, and could hopefully make a decision.  He's guaranteed my business for years to come.  And the business of my boyfriend, who said the guy was way more patient with me that he would have been. =)  I tend to agree.   Ohhh, late breaking news folks.   I'm enjoying playing this game. =)  I just got a call from the company dealership - they don't want to lose my business.  I got asked what I was being offered at the other place, told that they'll beat that, and would I give them a chance?  We'll see how this plays out over the course of the day. =)   Anyways . . .  I'm still in a battle over the broken car that started this whole fiasco.  Today's project is to call BBB to find out what my rights are, or if I even have any, before I go ahead and start being pushy (me? pushy?  that'll be interesting *L*).   I feel like such a cheapskate lately.   While I'm sure all of my bargaining lately is legit, it still makes me feel cheap.  I'm trying to get money back on my broken car.  I'm haggling over the price of a new car.  I'm hoping (once it's properly fixed) to make a decent sum of money on my old car.  I'm worried that pretty soon, out of habit, I'll start arguing with the cashier over the price of my groceries. *L*  Hardly, but that's sure how I feel.  And numbers.  Ohhhh, numbers.  They are constantly changing!!  "$1700 to fix your car, ma'am" . . . "oops, the final bill's $1821" . . . "with a MSRP of $23895, we'll sell it to you for $23100, and that'll be a montly payment of $360 over 3 years" . . . "but I want four years" . . . "oh, and that doesn't include your grad rebate or our promotional offer" . . . "ok, so that's $308 now, but that's before GST" . . . AHHHHHHH!!  After two hours of this last night, I was ready to scream.  I'm glad I'm not in accounting . . . =)   You know . . .  wouldn't it be just peachy if, after all this stress, I called the Ring In & Win number and won my vehicle?  With my luck, I have better chances of winning the lottery - and I don't buy lotto tickets.  But you never know . . .    I can't wait to have this whole thing over with.   But each time I think I've finally made a decision, I talk to someone new, and they have their own advice.  And it makes sense, but it gives me something more to think about, and it makes me re-consider my decision.  This really isn't something I want to just jump into - this is a 3-5 year commitment.  Oy vay . . .

       The ballots are in . . .  a Cavalier it shall be.   I had a realization last night . . .  this is not a life-altering decision.  I can change my mind again in a few years.  It's just not worth being stressed out by the payments to get a car I think I really love.  It's just a car, and it'll forever be an expense, not an asset (though I believe they can be used as collateral, but that's not a concern of mine right now).   It made me feel immensely relieved  to finally make this decision and have it validated by someone who's opinion matters to me.  Not matter how many people may say I should have gone with such-and-such, it's my decision.  That feels good. =)   I've never been a terribly opinionated person.   Major decisions often don't come easy to me.  I can take both sides and argue both sides in an argument, and often don't have a strong position on any subject.  That's changed lately, and I like it. =)  Nobody likes a person with a weak spine, or no opinions of their own.  Perhaps some people who are used to the 'aim-to-please' me may not be so impressed, but that's their problem!   Tomorrow's the big day . . .  I'm excited! =)

       Wow,  an interesting weekend for once. =)   By noon on Saturday , I was a basket case.  I'd been to the Toyota dealership and test-driven a Matrix and a Corolla.  The Matrix was definitely more attractive, but just enough more $$ than the sensible Corolla to cause me problems.  I realized later in the afternoon why the lease payments were so much higher for the same selling price - Toyota has awful interest rates.  So I decided to let everything marinate.   Then I got ambitious  in the afternoon.  While the boyfriend was off at his brother's stag, I went back to the Chevy dealership to see what a Cavalier felt like, and to get a few more numbers from the salesman.  Funny - I was told earlier in the week that there wasn't really bargaining room with a Cavalier because they made up 30% of the sales.  This didn't make sense to me, and I realized why.  When I was given a few more quotes on Saturday, suddenly the price was getting lower.  Fancy that.  Apparently prices are only flexible once they think you're actually serious.   Oh, the battle!   Chevy's got so many things going for them financially . . . I'd pay almost $100/mo less than if I got a similarly priced Toyota (the Matrix).  And they have that Ring In to Win . . . and a better new grad rebate . . . ohhhhh, but the Matrix is what I want.  Today's task is to talk to the bank and explore financing options instead of leasing.  I really want that Matrix . . . can you tell? =)   Anyways,  after my mind had taken in all it could as far as cars went, I decided that a visit to my mum's was in order.  I took my car (the awful one I'm replacing) to get a car wash on the way.  No biggie - I figured it would be good to run it a short distance once a week, just to make sure it's still running fine.  And all was fine.  Until I took it home.  And it started making the rattling noise again.  I'm not usually a terribly emotional person, but I burst out crying.  I really thought I'd had all the trouble I possibly could with that thing.  And I still need a way to pay off the repairs.  I hate to realize it, but I think friendships are going to have to be put aside so I (or more accurately, my boyfriend) can have it out with the shop.   Hmmm . . . and then Sunday.   Surprisingly, no more car stories for Sunday! =)  It started out as a quiet day, with me determined to not get kicked out of the washer and dryer before I got all the laundry done.  I ended up getting it all done without any competition.  And I got to meet yet another cousin of my boyfriends.  He has such a huge family!  I'm constantly meeting new cousins, or aunts and uncles, or grandparents . . . and I still can't keep straight the names of his 4 younger brothers and step-brothers.   And still no Christmas shopping . . .  just barely a week left to do it!  I'll get it done eventually. =)

       Today's car-du-jour . . .  a Toyota Corolla.  Although I still haven't had a chance to check out any import dealerships yet, I've had a lot of encouragement on this one.   I was really surprised  while doing my preliminary research online.  The price of a Corolla is very similar to that of a Cavalier, and just a tad less than a Civic.  Yet it's got more options that come standard than with the Civic for a similiar price, and has the reputation of holding its value much better than a Cavalier.  Which means it's more likely to be worth more than the buy-out price, something that's difficult to say about the Cavalier.   But enough about cars for now .  Hmmm, I guess that runs me out of topics then.  =)  I just want the work day to be over so I can quit stewing and start looking.  Much as I don't want to be rushed, I don't want to be borrowing my loaner car more than the 10 days it was given to me for.  Which means I've got til the end of next week.  And I certainly don't want my thoughts to be dominated by cars over Christmas!   Ixtapa, Le!   Sounds like your work benefits are starting to kick in . . . =)  That's so exciting!  Hope everyone has a good weekend . . .

       I've been reading a few more blogs lately , and I really like the format of bolding the first few words of each paragraph.  It really makes it much easier on the eyes.  Maybe I'll eventually come up with my own unique style. (yeah right) =)   I'm very excited now  about the whole idea of having a new car.  I keep going back and forth - anyone who's been reading here, or who knows me in person, knows this is all I think or talk about. =)  Gotta get some new material soon.  I've never had a new vehicle, aside from the 3 days I was given a Toyota Echo while my car was being fixed (not my fault, I can assure you).  My mum just bought her first new car in 17 years a few weeks back . . . before that, she drove an '85 Astro van that she's had since it was new in '85.   Sadly, my preparation for Christmas has been overshadowed  by this need for a more reliable vehicle.  I don't have a tree up (though that's somewhat by choice - I shudder to think what my cats might do to it), no red-and-green decorations, and worst of all, no gift-shopping has been accomplished.  Well, I had bought something for my mum, and after a week, decided it wasn't quite what I wanted to get her.  By the time I can actually go to the mall, I'm going first thing in the morning armed with a list and a predetermined agenda.   OK, really, where the heck is Leah?   This is taunting me . . .    I went to the dentist today  for the first time in nearly 4 years.  I'd forgotten how long that can take!  I was a new patient to this dentist, so there were forms to fill out, introductions to make, questions to ask.  The appointment was at 9am, and I didn't make it back to work until noon.  But my teeth feel oh-so-clean, despite being a tad achey (I'm horrible for remembering to floss) . . .    Well, time for a bank run, me thinks .  Line ups are going to be crazy tomorrow, so I might as well get some of it done today.  Besides, I like having an excuse to leave early.  Since the banks are right across from my apartment, I've been told to "go on my way home."  But since they're only open so late, I get to leave work early. =)  Enh, I only like leaving early when there's really nothing better to do.  Which is the case today.

       Salesmen make me nervous   Does anyone else out there feel this way?  It's instinct for me to be very leery and cautious around salesmen.  Especially car salesmen.  I mean, it's such a huge purchase, and most people (definitely include me in the category) and less-than-well-informed when it comes to buying a new car.  It probably has a lot to do with stories I've heard, and the bias of people around me.  I feel like if I don't know exactly what I want and exactly how much I should be paying, I'm going to be taken for a ride.  Pardon the pun. =)  I went car shopping for the very first time last night.  So much to take in!  My longest stop was the first, and still my best impression.  Good impression #1 - The guy had a computer and offered me concrete numbers for various different options.  Instead of trying to get me to buy up, he was doing everything he could to accomodate my needs.  Perhaps the sales industry gets a bad rap. =)  This was my local Chevy dealership.  Good impression #2 -  he managed to explain leasing to me in terms that I understood.  I have a similar feeling regarding leasing as I do about car salesmen. =)  However, my experience and knowledge on the subject is limited to what I've heard from family and friends, and various short online articles.  There's definitely something to be said about being well-informed.  I had an aunt who leased a vehicle, and she swore she'd never do it again.  I never quizzed her on why.  It was a Plymouth Breeze - maybe that has something to do with it.  Or maybe she owed money at the end.  I really don't know.  But leasing makes so much sense for me.  I can't put a large sum towards a down payment, and I need low monthly payments for the next while, and I'm extremely wary of getting another car that won't be good to me.  This way, I get a brand new car, it's under warranty as long as I'm paying for it (as long as the lease, anyways), and my options are open at the end of the term.  Some would argue (as I did, initially) that it makes no sense to pay for something I'm not going to own.  Very good point.  But cars are such money-pits anyways . . . how do I know I really WANT to own the car in 3-4 years?  All I have to do is abide by the terms - not driving more than 20000km/year, keeping up the maintenance, and not abusing it - and I can hand it back for something else in a few years.  I never ever thought I would be saying to people "Yeah, I'm leasing my car."  But it looks like that's going to be the case . . .   Good impression #3 - So far, GM offers the most attractive bonus for new grads ($1000), and their guaranteed $1000 off with ring in to win helps, too.  If anyone knows of somewhere that offers better deals than this, by all means, let me know! =)  Next up was a nearby Dodge/Chrysler one.  I think I was biased to begin with (my current vehicle is a Dodge), but I wasn't given any definite numbers, nor did the salesman even have a computer at his disposal.  Also, he didn't think I qualified for their new grad program cuz it was "just" a SAIT diploma program.  He was a helpful and nice guy . . . but I wasn't wowed into buying a new Dodge SX to up my SX appeal. =)  I like the slogan though.  On tonight's agenda - an import dealership or two.  Toyota, Hyundai, and Honda have excellent reputations when it comes to small cars . . .

       Friends are fleeting after all . . .    To all those people who ever told me that friends would be the most reliable and constant thing in my life - that men merely come and go - I say BS.  Friends are the ones that come and go, so you might as well put that extra effort into a relationship.  Or maybe it's just female friends that come and go.  At least in a relationship, once it reaches a certain point, both sides are willing to put in an effort to get to know the other person well.  They give each other the benefit of the doubt.  I don't know - maybe I just don't pick my friends very well.  My apologies to any good friends who may be reading this.  It's really only a handful of past friends that I'm angry about.  Oh well . . . water under the bridge, right?  Why should I waste time with ANYONE - man or woman - who can't be bothered to treat me like they would want to be treated?  I shouldn't, and I won't.  And I'm not going to waste anymore energy on this.  As kelly would put it - I just needed to whine. =)

       A late list of Thanksgiving . . .    Just so you people don't think I'm nothing but a whiney, self-pitying, spoiled brat . . . and to remind myself of what's actually GOOD right now . . .   I'm thankful I have a supportive boyfriend.  He lets me bitch and complain, and he's chauffeured me around, but he's also reminded me that it's not the end of the world.  He won't let me wallow in self-pity.  I'm thankful I know my mother still loves and supports me however she can.  Even though I can't say the same for my father, at least I know she'll always be there.  She's listened to me complain after I've worn my boyfriends ear off, and she empathizes in a way only mothers can do.  I'm thankful I have a fulltime job that I enjoy.  Even though things aren't always predictable, I know I'm pretty secure, and I actually want to do well for the company.  When there's actually work to be done, of course. =)  I'm thankful I've been able to get rides when I needed them.  There have been many times I could have been told flat out "no", and although sometimes I've had to ask around, or make last-minute arrangements, I've always managed to get where I needed.  I'm thankful I have a roof over my head.  Despite how bad things may seem to me at times, I can still pay my rent, my bills (maybe late, some times), and for groceries.  As long as I can keep doing that, I know I'm OK.  I'm thankful I have the freedom to complain like I do. =)  There are still countries where speaking your mind can get you killed.  That's pretty awful.  Well, I could keep going on like that . . . I guess there really are lots of things to be thankful for.  I think I've accomplished what I'd set out to do.  I hope everyone has a good day. =)

       Honesty doesn't pay   OK, now on to the next topic.  I learned a valuable lesson yesterday - it doesn't pay to be honest.  I recently applied for a second job.  The personnel company was very impressed with my testing scores, and the hours and pay were perfect for me.  I was told as soon as I was interviewed that I had the job.  Wonderful.  The money was really going to help out greatly.  It was to start yesterday evening.  I was devastated when I realized that my boyfriend's brother's wedding fell on one of the weekends I would be working.  But I told the agency rep at the orientation about it, and she seemed pretty sure it wouldn't be a problem - she just needed to know when it was exactly, in case I needed the whole shift off, or just a few hours.  It turns out I could still work a couple of hours that day.  Yesterday, she called me up and again assured me she didn't think it would be a problem.  Less than an hour before I was to leave for this job, she called me back.  Apparently it's a problem with the client - they need people who can commit to the full 4 weeks.  Yet during the orientation, it was stressed that family emergencies were valid reasons for missing a shift, just don't have 35 of them.    So I was replaced at the last minute without even having a say in it.  I wasn't even given the choice to say I wouldn't go to the wedding (not that I would - but they don't know how important or unimportant this wedding was to me) . . . I was simply replaced.  I was crushed.    I'm sure some (many, probably) people are thinking, "Oh, cry me a river . . . lots of people have worse problems."  I'm sure they do, and I know things could be worse . . . but it doesn't make what's going on any less stressful knowing that.  I just try to remind myself that I believe that everything happens for a reason.  Everything happens for a reason.  Not that I think I can afford to, but I suppose now I'll have the time to go car shopping.  And since my loaner car, which I thought would gladly be lent to me for a month or so, is only reluctantly mine for a week or 10 days, I suppose that's a good thing.  And I'm tired of relying on other people for things - generosity of rides, mainly.  Although some people offered "let me know if you need a ride", some never came through, and those who did, I can tell their patience is wearing thin.  I don't blame them.  So, lesson learned yesterday . . . as far as parttime work goes, I don't have a life.  I just have lots of sick relatives.

       Noisy Neighbours   One of today's likely numerous griping subjects is noisy neighbours.  I've been spending a lot of time at my boyfriend's lately, so that it's easier for me to get rides places.  Believe me - I miss my kitties greatly.  Every time I pop home for a little while to check up on them, and replenish their food and water, I wonder how much longer it'll be til they turn feral.  I would much rather be able to go home of my choosing, but what can you do when you're depending on someone else to get around?  Anyways . . .   We used to have good friends who lived upstairs from him.  It was great - on nights when we were all feeling lazy, we'd hop upstairs and hang out with them for the evening.  Making pasta and need to borrow a colander?  No problem!  (It's funny that they bought him one for this birthday! *s*)  But sadly, people branch out, and they bought a house.  Good for them, but sad for us.  I miss having them so close.  And it's not solely because the new neighbours annoy me.  But that's what I'm going to gripe about.  Is it just me, or is it common courtesy to tone things down after 10pm, especially on a week night?  In fact, I thought it was even law.  But I could be wrong.  These neighbours have annoyed me from day one, and I have yet to even meet them.  There's only the two of them, with 2 dogs (a pitbull and a rotty), 2 cats, and a snake, I believe.  They have 3 cars, and often have friends over, which means the driveway is full, as well as the street parking on both sides.  Even though I prompted my boyfriend to ask them about laundry days (after all, it's not MY place, but I often do the laundry), they said they don't care.  Nothing bugs me more than people who pull stuff out of the washing machine and dump it on top of the dryer.  ESPECIALLY when they pull the stuff out of the dryer and put it on top of the wet stuff!  I mean, I understand if I've left stuff in the dryer for a coupla hours, and nobody's home, and you need to get on with some laundry.  Fine.  Put the dry stuff on top of the dryer.  But when there's wet stuff, and it's going to take 20-30 mins anyway to wash anything, why not just put the wet stuff in the dryer for the other person?  This is a huge pet peeve of mine.  It's not as if they're coin machines, where you have to pay to use them.  And they've left garbage in the lobby at the back door.  For days.  And when it was finally taken out back, it was merely dumped over the fence haphazardly, right into the bushes.  And noisy.  Last night, I was kept awake til past midnight.  They sound like a herd of elephants, no word of a lie.  I even asked my boyfriend if our previous friends were that noisy, just to be sure I wasn't biased, and he said no.  They had friends over and were yelling and laughing and stomping around.  I was too tired to stomp up there myself, but not tired enough to be able to block them out and sleep.  I don't think it helped that they were in the kitchen most of the time, and that's directly above the bedroom.  Yes, I'm cranky this morning. =)  I like my beauty sleep, especially after I've had the flu all weekend.

       Silly Producers . . .    Survivor was a little more interesting last night, but not as interesting as I believe it could have been.  I thought that was a great reward challenge - bringing in the contestants' significant others or replacements, and making them do all the hard work.  I was blown awake by how determined Jake's wife was to win that challenge.  I felt horrible when she didn't win.  I would really have preferred to see her spend a day with Jake than Helen with her husband.  I'm sorry, but after 31 days apart, talking would not be my first priority if I had my husband for a mere 24 hours.  I'd've made the polite introductions around the camp, given him the 2-second tour so he could go home and say he'd been there, and then I'd be dragging him off into the bushes.  Nobody would see (though they might hear) from me until the boat arrived to take him away.  You can talk as much as you want when you get home, but I can think of much better things to do if time is limited.  From the way Jake and Jenny acted when they actually got to see each other during the immunity challenge, my guess is they have a pretty similar idea.  They would have been a much more interesting couple.  Or Brian and his wife.  Maybe the network would have won back all the viewers they lost when Erin was kicked off.  I tell ya - kicking off Erin one week and Ken the next . . . I'm sure the ratings took quite a hit.    And I was very sad to see Jake go.  The look of "I told you so" was so plain on the faces of the jury members . . . in a way, I suppose it was good strategy.  Eliminate the chances of a former Sook Jai member making it to the finals.  They already think Chuay Gan has it out for them, why risk them having the majority in the jury when it comes time to voting for the winner?  At least the winner might not be so obvious if they have to choose between two Chuay Gan members.  And what on earth happened to Penny's ears?  They've suddenly disappeared . . . now I can't make fun of her anymore. =(

       Playing Games   Playing games is fun.  Monopoly with friends or family, a rowdy game of Taboo, or perhaps strip-Twister when the TV doesn't work.  But it gets you nowhere when you play games in relationships.  I'm horrible for this!  I've gotten better though.  And I'm very grateful that my current boyfriend doesn't play back - in fact, he usually doesn't even notice when I'm trying to "pull" something.  It's good for me, cuz it's a constant reminder of how silly and immature it is.  Take this morning for example.  I was in a bad mood.  I had to get a ride, which meant I was at the mercy of someone else's schedule.  I had 20 mins to get ready, which meant no breakfast or making a lunch.  Pout.  I like my Cheerios in the morning.  Then I didn't have enough cash to pick something up at Tim Horton's (I'm useless without my morning coffee), so that didn't help my mood.  I hardly said two words to my boyfriend, except to tell him not to bother stopping at Tim Horton's.  Now, in my mind, this was how it was supposed to play out -  Psychic boyfriend, knowing I ALWAYS want to stop there:"No Tim Horton's?  How come?" Gracious me, attempting selflessness: "Well, I'm short on cash, and I don't want to make you any later" Psychic boyfriend, knowing I really DO want to stop: "Well, I've got a couple extra bucks, and I'm actually a little early, so don't worry about it" Grateful me, having gotten what I wanted: "Awww, thanks sweetie!"  This was how it actually played out -  Silence. Sulking me: "Don't worry about stopping at Tim Horton's." Oblivious him: "OK." Silence.  He's not completely oblivious - he'll know I was mad about something this morning, and he'll wonder what the heck he's done wrong  now .  Except he's done nothing wrong except for not being able to read my mind.  Now I feel horrible.  I wonder how many other people do stupid stuff like this . . .

       New Cars Rock!   Despite all my recent car troubles, I'm starting to get excited at the thought of a new car.  Wanna hear the story?  No?  Well, tough - I'm gonna tell it anyways. =)  As if I haven't ranted to enough people about it already . . .  It all started back in '93. . . oh wait, maybe I'll give the shortened version.  Three weeks ago, being dangerously ignorant about the inner workings of my car, I allowed it to overheat.  I didn't realize how serious a problem this was - I was only 2 blocks from home when the temperature gauge topped out, so I figured I'd get it home quick, and park it until I'd been advised otherwise by my all-knowing boyfriend. =)  Silly me.  Aluminum engines and heat DO NOT mix.  I should have shut it off as soon as the gauge started creeping up.  Well, the next day all was fine . . . I did quite a bit of driving, and all seemed fine.  So I didn't worry about it.  The next day, however, I was on my merry way from work to the gym when the needle started creeping up again.   Fast .  I was terrified.  I pulled over as fast as I could, called the trusty boyfriend, and he rushed to my rescue.  I had coolant sprayed all over one side of the engine, and a growing puddle under the car.  After calling our trusty mechanic friend, the preliminary diagnosis was a cracked head.  Ouch.  Even as ignorant as I am, I know the word "HEAD", in reference to a car, always means big money.  Same with "transmission" and "engine".  So into the shop it was towed.  Many dollars, but only two days, later I had my car back.  I was relieved.  Despite the cost - money always comes and goes - at least I had a vehicle again.  All was fine for a week.  Then the weekend rolled around.  We had to make a trip to Banff for a company Christmas party.  Since my boyfriend's car is older and mine had just been fixed, mine was the logical choice.  Apparently not.  The engine started making a faint, but slightly unnerving noise just before Canmore.  After a roadside inspection, my boyfriend couldn't see anything, so we continued on our way.  The noise got louder.  Never a good sign.  So another roadside inspection was made.  After losing the oil pressure briefly, and making a frantic call to our mechanic friend, we called AMA.  I am eternally grateful for my CAA Plus membership . . . it was towed 5km shy of Banff all the way back to Calgary at no charge to me.  I think it's easily paid for itself for the next 2-3 years . . .   Hoping against hope that something had gone wrong with the new head and that any repairs were under warantee, Monday I was delivered the bad news.  The lower part of the engine was now worn out, and a whole new engine was recommended.  Hahahahaha, very funny.  After what I'd already paid for the head, the cost of replacing the engine far exceeded the value of the car.  No way.  I told them to do whatever was necessary for me to be able to drive it again without replacing the engine.  It could be fine for another year, or another month.  No guarantees.  So I'm going to take my chances with a new car.  Whether it's just a car that's new to me, or a brand new car, I haven't yet decided.  Having just recently graduated, institutions love giving me credit . . . but I'm a little scared to get in over my head.  But the idea of a brand new car . . . ohhhhh man, that's tempting.  New car smell.  Warantees.  No rust.  No cracked windshield.  Power everything.  Mostly likely a CD player and working speakers.  Niiiiice. *L*  Hmmm . . . maybe this New Year  will  bring good things with it . . .   Come to think of it, I know quite a few people who are counting on having a better year in 2003 than 2002 delivered . . . I sure hope that comes true for them!

       It's all a game . . .    It feels like it's been a long week.  Between being swamped at work (but not too swamped to post *L*) and all the excitement after work hours, my brain has already shut off, and it's only 2:19pm.  What shall I do?  So all I can think of his how cute the cats are.  I really think the current arrangement is for the best.  Tigger and Stupid make such good playmates.  They're both very active cats, and love chasing each other around.  Jazz didn't run much, so I think Tigger is tickled pink with this new cat.  She actually plays with him.  While there's still the odd growl, I've watched them play, and a lot of the noise is just for show.  I haven't seen any real viciousness.  They chase each other around the apartment in the same pattern.  It was funny, cuz last night, my bf came into the computer room and said "I don't think Tigger likes all the playing."  I said, "What do you mean?  Stupid the one doing any growling, but I've been watching, and they're having a blast."  "Well, Stupid was chasing him around, and TIgger just flopped on the floor as if he was exhausted."  "Ohhh . . . *giggle* that's all part of his game."  "Huh?"  "He lets someone chase him around, then flops down as if he's tired.  When the other cat figures it's all over and turns to leave, he jumps up and chases them.  I know my cat."  Cats are so cute. =)

       OK, now for the good stuff!    The house has an address now!   We were filling out schedule after schedule last night (2 hours in total, I think), and there was an address at the top of every page.  It was so exciting!  We were put on the spot a little, because the sales guy brought out the list of options, and apparently we were supposed to have gotten it earlier.  No biggie - it's just to get a price for the house.  We're not signing our names to those options . . . so we went generous, and since going home and talking about it, have already changed our minds about several of them.  We'll probably be pleasantly surprised by a slightly cheaper price when all is said and done.   My bf is adamant  that we upgrade the furnace to high-efficiency from the standard mid-eff.  Go nuts, kiddo. =)  I'm adamant that we upgrade the bathtub to a slightly wider one with a tile backsplash from the narrow, one-piece surround that comes standard.  There has been lots of discussion, but no arguments yet. =)  We seem to agree on a lot of stuff . . . like both of us could care less about upgrading the light fixtures or adding tint to the standard off-white paint colour.  I mean, really - who pays much attention to the wall colour or light fixtures unless they're really obvious or really ugly??  Not me.  There's a colour theme in one of the showhome kitchens that I've fallen in love with . . . flat white cupboards with rounded edges, black appliances, dirty-white and light gray tile backsplash, and a marbled dark grayish countertop.  OK, so description doesn't do it justice.  I think it looks sharp.  I hope I don't get overwhelmed by all the choices we're going to have to make!  Now all we have to do is  confirm the mortgage,  hand over our second deposit, and construction will begin!  Oh, the excitement . . .    And then there's the topic of a cohabitation agreement . . .  and while I agree that it may seem negative to plan for the worst, I also think it's a smart thing to discuss while things are good.  Neither of us plans for things to go bad . . . but neither did I in my last relationship.  And it sure would have made the split easier if we'd drawn up an agreement beforehand.  And now that there's an asset as huge as a house to divide . . . it just seems like a responsible thing to do.   Ideally, it'll never have to be put into effect . . .

       The bitching first today . . .  then I can make way for all the goodness! =)   I damn near had a heart-attack this morning.   I swear.  It's my morning ritual to stop at Timmy's on my way into work.  I usually park in the second row of parking stalls, since there's less traffic coming and going than in the first row.  Well, today the second row was full, so I parked in the first one.  Just as I was leaving, this huge 18-wheeler was trying to pull into the same row . . . what the hell was the driver thinking?  Anyways, I left room so he could swing around - if he even fit between the rows of cars - and just as he was almost passed, I started laying on the horn and trying to get into reverse at the same time.  He was still moving, less than an inch away from my mirror and getting closer!  There was someone behind me, so I didn't have much space to move.  Luckily, the guy stopped long enough for me to get my car back into first, and I went around him and got the hell outta there!  I was so sure he was going to hit my car . . .    And more cat troubles.   Manageable ones, but still troubles nonetheless.  I was still lounging in bed half-awake when I heard "Oh that's nice" in a sarcastic tone from my bf.  I figured maybe he realized he'd forgotten to wash his work clothes and was out of clean ones.  But no - Tigger had peed in the laundry basket again.  This has been a sporadic but on-going problem.  The first time my bf was over at my apartment, he casually tossed his jacket over a little cart.  Neither of us thought anything of it.  Until I saw my cat sitting on it in a slightly awkward position.  I squirted him with the water bottle - usually he takes off right away, but this time it took him a good full second or two to respond.  Lovely - he'd peed on the jacket.  And since I moved in, Tigger's peed at least twice in the laundry basket, and always right on top of a workshirt.  Last time, it was obviously a couple of days old, as it had dried and the only clue was the smell as I went to do laundry.  But this morning was very obviously fresh.  He wouldn't respond when I called him, so he's obviously doing this on purpose.  I put his face in it, smacked him and said "no" . . . but who knows if that'll do anything?  I suppose it could be event-related - the first time, because I moved him, and this time, because Jazz is gone.  I hope it doesn't continue.  Cat pee is gross.  Especially on clothes.  The smell stays in your nose forever.   Any advice out there on this problem?

       Hmmm . . . on the topic of giving up too easily . . .    People are a little more complicated than pets, but I'm following my train of thought today.   I had a falling-out  with a friend of mine a while back.  It was over something quite petty (I thought), but it escalated, mean things were said, and we haven't spoken since.  I was recently asked by a friend who knows both of us why we're still not talking.  To be honest, I hadn't given it much thought.  I was very upset and hurt by some of the words that were directly my way, and I found it very easy to just forget the whole thing and not talk anymore.  She hasn't initiated any further conversation, so neither have I.  I couldn't give the well-meaning friend a good answer, except to say that neither of us has made any effort to fix things.   I've experienced this in romantic relationships, too.   It gets complicated when two people with individual perspectives and interpretations are involved.  One person may feel they made an attempt to apologize or smooth things over, but it wasn't well-received, and at the same time, the other person could be feeling the same way.  Both feel wronged, both feel they did what they could, but still nothing is fixed.  When is it OK to say "enough is enough, this just isn't worth my time anymore"?  Is there ever a time?  Pride and stubbornness are evil things, and unfortunately they're traits that run strong in my blood (bloody British decent).     My mind ponders -  do my other friends see this, and subconsciously wonder who's going to be next?  Commitment - between friends or lovers - is tricky business.  I mean, at what point do you choose which is more important - sticking by the other person, or protecting yourself from further hurt/harm?  I'm beginning to understand a little more why divorce is so prevalent these days . . . but then, how do/did so many couples in our grandparents generation stay together?  Are they just more innocent?  Less likely to hurt each other?  I doubt it . . . basic human nature has not changed over the last 50 years or so.  So then, what is it?  The search continues . . .    I'd best leave these thoughts alone for now,  lest I work myself into a foul and negative mood for the rest of the day . . .    Any comments or insights on the subject are more than welcome . . .

       Mmmmm, Timmy's . . .    I feel for those of you who aren't  Canadian .  By far, one of the best things about this country is Tim Horton's.  OK, maybe not the best thing, but certainly way up there.  I like that commercial about the kid who goes to college abroad, but misses home so much that he writes Tim Horton's and they send him a box full of coffee/cups/etc.  =)   I'm nibblin' on Timbits  and drinking a Timmy's mocha as I write this . . . a hump-day indulgence. =)   But underneath the oral distraction,  I have a moral dilemma nagging at me this morning.  Not as much as last night, and I'm sure it'll fade into the background with time, but it nags at me nonetheless.   I've mentioned before  about having trouble with one of my cats getting along with my bf's cat.  She's declawed - neither of mine are.  Ever since I've been living on my own, I've debated back and forth whether or not to give one of them back to my ex.  It's always been that Tigger is definitely 'my' cat, and Jazz is just kind of a people cat - he's an attention whore, and loves anyone who's giving it.  But my ex has always wanted him back.  I didn't want to separate the cats, especially when I wasn't home very often.  At least they had each other for company.  I needed very good justification for letting him go.  I thought I had it, when a couple of nights ago, I was petting bf's cat and I noticed a lump on her haunch.  On closer inspection, it turned out to be an embedded claw.  Seeing as only two of them still fought on a regular basis, and the suspect (Jazz) had the most broken claws, it definitely concerned me.  I could not afford - if it was even allowed at their age - to have two cats declawed.  The fighting regularly woke me up in the middle of the night, and I didn't want to be constantly worrying about cats getting hurt while we're not home.  So I let Jazz go last night.   I was a little sad  to leave him behind, but boy oh boy, did I sleep well last night.  I feel relieved on some level . . . but did I do the right thing?  Am I a horrible person for giving up on a pet?  Is it giving up if I merely hand him over to a previous co-owner who's wanted him back for a while?  While I don't miss the non-stop whiney meows or the fighting, and I don't regret my decision,  it's the idea that I gave up too easily that bothers me.   No one's said it to me - that I gave up too easily - it's just that my uber-critical parent voice is particularly strong. *L*  I'm extremely adept at mental self-torture.   I'm sure in a few days  I won't feel bad at all . . . it's just something that occupies my mind at the moment.

       TOUCHDOWN!   Hehehe, I absolutely  love  that commercial they played during the  SuperBowl  . . . the little kid on his father's lap, watching football, yells "touchdown" everytime one occurs, no matter which team scores one.  Dad's getting frustrated, just as mom walks by, smiles proudly, and says 'That's my boy!'  Priceless.  Too bad the  Raiders didn't show up  for the game until late in the 3rd quarter.  That was very sad . . . 34 to 3 shortly after halftime.  They scored a few great touchdowns late in the game, but it was a case of too little too late.  And then, to add insult to injury, the Buccs made two awe-inspiring intercepts & touchdowns in the last minutes of the game to seal the deal.  48 to 21.  I wasn't really cheering for either team, as I haven't been following the NFL much this season, but I have to hand it to Tampa Bay - they played an awesome game.  Way to go, underdogs. =)   Today really is a beautiful day . . .  yesterday, it soared from -20.5C in the wee hours of the morning until it reached 11.9C in the afternoon.  Absolutely gorgeous weather.  Made me and the bf wish we had the house already . . . it was one of those days where there wasn't much to do (waiting for the game to start), and perfect weather for just sitting on the porch and veggin'.  Can't wait. =)  The front will face east, which means a few minutes can be spent enjoying a coffee on the porch before work, and a west-facing backyard that'll be ideal for afternoon/evening BBQs . . .    The more of a reality this house becomes,  though, the more I start to realize this is more commitment.  Maybe not as much as marriage, but certainly another step in that direction.  Are we ready?  Are we going to be willing to put in the effort when rough times inevitably arise?  And if we are, then why not get married?  Only time will tell . . . and perhaps that's what I'm waiting for.  A test of sorts, to see if we will stick by each other even through the less-pleasant times.  Perhaps once that test has been passed or failed, I'll feel more comfortable with the idea of marriage.  Statistics are in favor of divorce these days, and tho one could argue that the breakup of a long-term non-marriage relationship is just as bad, divorce is just something I don't want to go through.  As my grandfather put it - once he was married, it was like "OK, there's no backing out of this, so we might as well do whatever we have to to make things work."  Not many people go into marriage with that attitude these days.  It's become so easy to rationalize a divorce . . . I want to make sure that, when I do finally get married, that I'm going into it with that attitude.   OK, enough of that.   It's only Monday morning.  Time to get some work done . . .

        It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood . . .      Well, OK, not really . . .  it was supposed to get up to nearly 0C yesterday, and be nice for the whole weekend, but it's still -23C.  Sucky.  But otherwise it's turning out to be a  pretty good day .   After the car drama  yesterday, it was nice to have a good distraction.  While I squandered away my last hour at work, the bf was home making calls on my behalf (to higher-ups than the shop owner).  It seems like he actually got somewhere.  So I was extremely relieved.  We also had a bank appointment shortly after work, and since we'd already been pre-approved at one bank, we figured we'd pay another visit to the home builders (Heartland Homes, by the way - I'd never heard of them until 2 weeks ago, but I've heard nothing but good things ever since).   We signed ourselves up for a lot!!!   They'll hold it for a few days (up to a week) before requiring a deposit to get the ball rolling and draw up a sales contract.  It was the last lot facing east (bf's good thinking - I'd never thought as far as lot orientation or location), so we decided to at least reserve it.  I couldn't believe this was all actually happening!  See, I'd done some extensive condo-hunting with an ex before, but it never got past the talking-about-it and looking phase.  So in my mind, I really wasn't expecting much to happen, or at least not quickly.  Then, after dinner, we decided to sit down with pen, paper and calculator and figure out  for sure  if this was something we could realistically do in the next 6 months (that's about how long it takes once a deposit is made).  Good news!  As we'd planned to do, we'll pay off our debts  and  save up the 5% down plus a little more.  And that was conservative.  Cuz you always have to estimate conservatively.  Err on the high side with expenses, the low side with income . . . maybe I'm just weird, but that's how I've always done it.  Better to have a little extra when all is said and done, than to come up short.   Goody goody gum drops . . .  I feel like a little kid.  Except little kids don't buy houses. =)  So I guess I'm giddy at all the  adult  things I've been doing recently . . . graduating, getting my own apartment, negotiating a raise, buying my first new car, finally paying off my credit cards (OK, that hasn't happened yet, but it's planned for), and buying a house.  So much, and all in the last 9 months or so!  I'm going to suffer from withdrawal when all the excitement is over in 6-8 months. =)

      Well, today is just a  rollercoaster ride!   I love rollercoasters, but I'm hating today.   I'm livid.   Absolutely, positively livid.  I'm almost sick to my stomach.  And since there doesn't seem to be much I can do now, I will use this as a venting forum.  I hadn't heard a peep from the  car shop  since last Wednesday.  I was getting a little nervous - but all I was thinking was that my car had been pushed to the bottom of the pile of priorities.  Which wouldn't have been a big deal.  I have a new car now - my only deadline is selling it before I owe money for the repairs.   But no.   I get a phone call this afternoon saying my car is ready to go.  Excuse me???? - I was still waiting to hear how much it was going to cost after a part had been sent to the machining shop.  After a couple of seconds, I recovered enough to ask how much the bill was.  I didn't want to know.  The naive part of myself (growing ever smaller every day) hoped that he'd seen the light and was only charging me what I'd told him I could afford - $300.  The larger part - the paranoid part - dreaded what he was going to tell me.  I was dumbfounded - $707.   No bloody f*&$%ing way.   Can I say that on here?  Well, I just did.  So what is there for me to do?  Nothing, really, except call him back and argue with him.  It's his word against mine.  Me:  "Do you recall the conversation we had last week when I told you $300 was all I was spending?" Him: "Well, yes, and I told you that the estimate was $584 and to think about it." Me:  "Yes, and I said you could go ahead and send it to the machining shop with the understanding that I would get a more accurate estimate before going ahead with anymore work." Him: "I gave you the estimate before it was sent." Me:  "Yes, and you also said that you didn't know for sure that it could even be fixed.  That it could cost more or less or they could even say 'we won't touch it.'  I made it  very  how much I was willing to spend." Him: "I was only going to call you back if they said they couldn't fix it."   And it only got worse from there.   This is just a nightmare.  He says he's already giving me a discount, so of course he thinks he's being the good guy.  Yay - he's giving me a discount of  half  the hours from the last job (less than if he was discounting half the hours from the current job) applied to the current work.  Sure, maybe it seems like he's compromising, but my car was only back in the shop because that last job didn't do anything to fix my car.   It's all his word against my word.   What the hell can I do?  I called the BBB, and they said because the shop is holding my car, there isn't much they can do.  Read: pay them what they want, and then fight to get it back.  Well, when I don't have the money in the first place, how the hell do you propose I do that?   The suggestion was made  (I won't mention by whom) to find the spare key and simply drive off with the car.  As angry as I am, I  do not  want a criminal charge added to my woes.  My plan at the moment (and it changes every few minutes) is to drive down there, ask for my car, and tell them to charge the repairs to my Petro-Can card.  And drive off fast.  Because it'll get declined.  I said $300 was all I was paying for a very good reason - it was how much room I had left on my Petro-Canada card.  Which would put me $3000 total in the hole for a car that I could only  hopefully  sell for that much.   Hopefully  being the operative word.  I don't even know for sure yet that it's going to run once I take it home.  Knowing my luck, and the track record with the shop, I'll probably get it home and it'll be clunking again.  But after just long enough for them to be able to say "Well, it was working when we test-drove it."  Maybe I should call in to the  police  and say it's  stolen .  Wonder what they would say?  Scratch that idea . . . the car's not even registered or insured anymore, cuz this whole thing has gone on so long.  So then I'd be the criminal, not them.  *sigh*  I really do feel sick to my stomach.  I'm tired of this.  So godd*mn bloody f*#!ing tired of all of this.  I will never ever   EVER   use that shop again.  And in case anyone else in Calgary needs the warning . . . don't go to the Petro-Canada Certigard on MacLeod Trail.  I'm out for now.   Where's that Prozac again? =)

      Wow - you can tell how  productive  I am at work today. =)   There's a very good reason  why there's a term out there -  soul food .  And it actually comes on a plate or bowl.   I don't need Prozac . . .  I just needed a good lunch. =)  A clubhouse sandwich from a little local deli, to be exact.   No wonder  I have trouble losing those 10-15 extra pounds I'm always trying to get rid of. =)  I'm not big exactly, but just over that lovely green "healthy" zone on those BMI/weight/height charts in doctors' offices.  I'm always trying to get down into the green zone, but it never seems to work.  And I wonder why. =)  Just means my workouts need to be a little more exhuberant, I guess . . .   Now that I'm  nourished  on several levels, back to work!

       I got some cool news  this morning.   I was a little worried  about what the banks would say when we went in to ask about mortgages.  At least one has already pre-approved us for far more than we need or want.  I was worried we'd get turned down by each and every one.  Nice news to get on a Thursday morning. =)  So maybe now we can go back and talk to the builder we chose, start working out some details.  No rush though.  There's still so much to learn.  Apart from that  small ray of sunshine , I'm not enjoying Thursday much more than I did Wednesday.  Maybe I should get out in the sun at lunch.  Hunger makes me grouchy.  Hmmm, a lot of things tend to make me grouchy.  It's a wonder anyone likes me. =)   I wonder how much Prozac costs . . .

      I found out some  lovely news  when I was over at my mum's the other day.  Apparently my brothers were flown out to the States at Christmas to visit my dad.  Apparently I'm not even worth a phone call.  I only just found this out.  I have had several  imaginary and animated conversations  with him in my head since.  Each one had an expletive every other word.  And I'll bet if I called him on it, he'd say something like, how could he possibly know my number?  I move so many times and don't fill him in - but he knows my cell number and it hasn't changed in almost 2 years.  And there's nothing stopping him from asking my brother(s).  We'd argue, and in the end, I'd hang up wondering how the hell this ended up being my fault.  Which is why I wouldn't call him in the first place.   My real father died  and was reincarnated in my favorite cat.  We talk all the time.  He wishes he could come back as a big burly man and kick my fake dad's butt.  He says it's OK with him if my grandpa gives me away when I get married.   Coocoocachoo . . .

       Has anyone out there  (among the whole 2 or 3 people who read my blog *L*) ever read that series of books called  "Don't Sweat the Small Stuff?"   It's a very good tool for  putting things in perspective .  A couple of years ago, going through my first "divorce", I was in my self-help book phase.  I have a few titles sitting on my bookshelf that I'm just a tad embarassed to display ("Are You The One For Me?", "Highly Sensitive People in Love", "Breakups for Dummies" to name a few).  But this one book was the best investment I made.   I think it's about time  to pull it out for a refresher.   Winter  seems to have this habit of making me prone to mild depression, I think.  It doesn't take much for me to take things personally, see every little thing as a big deal, to get upset over nothing.  I'm sure if I thought hard enough, the hardest points in my life probably occurred during winter.  It's not so much the events themselves, but in how I dealt with them.  And I'm sure the sleep-interrupted nights aren't helping to that end.   On a good note . . .  last night went better.  We decided to separate the cats before going to bed, and apart from partially waking up once or twice (one of my cats  hates  being locked in a room - I think he whined and pawed/scratched at the door most of the night), I slept pretty well.  A few more nights like that, and hopefully I'll get caught up. =)   So, my motto  for the next little while will be "don't sweat the small stuff, Ang . . . cuz it's all small stuff!" . . .  *giggling already at the cheesiness of it all*

       I need more sleep.   I'm getting grumpy, and I hate grumpy gusses.   I'm sick and tired  of hearing cats growl and hiss at each other.  There hasn't been any real scrapping, but damn, when you get woken up once every hour at night because the cats pass too closely to each other, it sure makes for a bad sleep.  My boyfriend tends to sleep through it all unless I get up to separate them.  I think separating them from the start tonight wouldn't be a bad idea.  Who knows?  I left them all out when I left for work this morning - maybe I'll come back and there'll only be two.  Or one.  God I'm morbid when I'm grumpy. *L*   I'm sick and tired  of cleaning.  The current place is probably going to be a permanent mess until we get a bigger place, and that kinda bugs me.  And my old place still has a few odd things left in it, and needs to be cleaned.  And I said I'd hand over the keys tomorrow night.  *sigh*  I want to wave a wand and have it all over and done with.  Everything clean and tidy.  And all while I take a nap.   Oh well . . .  I suppose the first little while is always stressful.  I've never been good with change.  Maybe when we finally have an actual date to look forward to (for a new place), I can relax a little.  Or when we finally settle into a routine at home.  And the cats settle down.

       It's about time for an update . . .     What a crazy week  it was last week.  So much work coming in, so much to think about when work was finally done . . . and this week promises to be the same.  So while I still have my Monday procrastination in full swing, I'll take advantage of it to update my blog.  I'm hoping to get internet at home soon so I'm not always doing this at work. =)   Outside of work,  most nights last week were spent at home ( home  home, where my cats were) packing up boxes and mentally configuring my boyfriend's apartment to see if everything would fit.  By most "living alone" standards, I don't have a whole lotta stuff . . . in the way of furniture, I have a kindly-donated sofa and chair, a spiffy new kitchen table, my double bed, a dresser, and two bookcases.  One thing I neglected - being a basement suite, my tallest bookcase just did not fit upright.   Saturday was spent house hunting again.   I've always enjoyed looking at houses, even if it's just for fun.  We decided to have a look in Okotoks, see if the prices were lower enough to justify the extra gas and mileage of the commute.  The last showhome we stopped in looked like a reasonably-sized bungalow from the exterior.  Once inside, we realized we were  way  out of our price range, but had a look all the same. =)  Once inside, the first impression was of an upper-class country retreat.  Spaceous vaulted ceilings with wooden-beam detailing, an elegant yet rustic stone fireplace with a wooden mantle, interior decorating to match.  A skylight in the spaceous kitchen . . . a very open floorplan . . .  a gigantic master bedroom that opened to a massive ensuite with jetted tub, which further opened into the walk-in closet.  A venture downstairs led to the equivalent of another home . . . not one or two, but three more bedrooms, a family room, two more bathrooms (in addition to the two upstairs), and the beginnings of partial kitchen.    Off the top of my head,  I estimated at least $220K .  How wrong I was . . . we asked the company rep about price ranges, and when he wouldn't give numbers right away, we knew we were in the wrong neighbourhood. =)  He went on about how there's two types of builders - one being the "cookie-cutter" ones that have set home plans and set lots that they want you to fit into - basically starter-home builders.  And then his type of builder, where you choose the lot, then decide who you want to build your home.  Not the other way around.  He stressed that their floorplans are just a starting point.  They pride themselves on never having two identical homes.  Which is all fine and dandy if you're looking for a second or third home, when money and mortgage qualification isn't such a huge issue, when you're looking to build  YOU'RE  home.  Unfortunately, that's not what we're looking for right now.  When he was all done with his spiel, I asked - for shits and giggles - how much that exact showhome sold for.   $349,000.   Damn.   After just two weekends,  I think we've finally narrowed it down to a neighbourhood.  My mum will be happy we're not looking in Airdrie anymore. =)  Then Sunday was spent  moving all my stuff in .  The actual moving part when very smoothly and quickly . . . it was the arranging and limited unpacking that was the most stressful.  It was a little more crowded than I was expecting, but that's what mum's garage is for, right? =)  I hope there's a little room left . . . she's got 3 out of her 4 kids storing stuff there, and that's only because the fourth one still lives at home.  But even if she only has room for 3 or 4 more boxes, that makes a huge difference to our place.   Last night was the worst  - first night with all the cats together.  The tubby one of mine was the most vocal . . . he spent most of the evening and night yowling at my boyfriend's cat, and we heard more than one sudden outburst, but neither of us was within viewing distance to see what happened.  Fortunately, no blood has been shed yet.  I hope it stays that way.  When it came time to sleep, my two cats became anxious - they wanted to be near me, but my boyfriend's cat was also used to sleeping in the bedroom.  So by about 2am, both of mine had been banished to the spare room just so we could sleep.  My second cat seems to avoid conflict as much as possible, which is nice.  Even if they don't become chummy, he's more likely to simply tolerate this new cat than the tubby one will be.  I know it's a bad way to think, but fortunately I think I still have a good back-up plan if things don't settle down in a little while.  Well, now that my  coffee has had time to kick in , perhaps I should get down to work . . .

       It's been so busy at work this week. . .     I want to update this,  but I guess a quick one will have to do.   The weekend was pretty great.   With the wedding on Saturday (which was wonderful), Sunday was just spent vegging.  It was a little hectic until the ceremonies finally got under way, but at the end of the day, they were a married couple and everyone was happy.  Of course, my boyfriend was asked about a million times when HE was getting married . . . why do people just always assume that the girl always wants to get married?  I pointed that out to a few people, but I don't think they heard me.  Oh well - at least we know where each other stands on the issue. =)  That's what's important.  Anyways, it's always  fun getting tipsy  and watching others get drunk. =)   Now back to the grind . . .  with a vengence.  Darn winter season . . . oh well, at least it means we're making money. =)

       IT'S FRIDAY! :)    Yay . . .  I'm excited to see some friends tonight, and also to get ready for the wedding tomorrow.  You know, little things you don't want to be doing the day-of, like nail polish and hair-curling (it takes me a good hour/hour-and-a-half to curl all my hair).  But for now, I have a  pet peeve  I feel like venting about.   I think it's great  when people make a decision to improve their life.  Mainly by becoming more fit, ie resolving to be a regular at the gym.  But what I don't like is the New Years' Resolution crowd.  You know, the people who crowd the gyms for the first month, and are never seen from again.  I suppose some people could consider me in this group, since I started going back just after the new year.  But I signed up in October, actually went regularly until my car died and I had trouble getting myself there.  I finally got my new car just after Christmas, which meant the logical time to start going back was just after the new year.   But it's darn near impossible!   One day, I actually made it inside, only to spend a good 10-15 mins of my time there waiting for equipment.  Another day, I spent 20 mins just circling for a parking spot before giving up.  You know, I think gyms should set up membership limits.  Ask people to commit to a time "block" they'll likely be there - say a morning block, an afternoon block, an after-work block, and an evening block.  Put a limit on how many people can sign up for each one.  I would have to say that's been the biggest deterrent for me in the past, when I've tried to set up a routine for going to the gym - it's just so crowded that I spend half my time waiting, and it just doesn't seem worth it.   Oh well -  I suppose if my theory's correct, the crowds should dissipate in another couple of weeks . . .

       Not much new today.    Very busy at work  for once.  See, I'll do work when it needs doing. =)   Finally told mum  last night about moving in with the bf.  I knew she wouldn't be thrilled, but she took it a lot better than I'd expected.  That was a nice surprise.  Had a nice chat with my youngest bro, too.  I don't usually hear or see much of him . . . makes me sad, cuz he's a cool guy. =)  Wow, I'm a  very boring person  when I actually do work when I'm at work!   Ohhh, ohhhh, ohhh . . .  and finally got a definitive yes on my 3-month raise today.  Only 6 weeks late . . . =)

       A short one today . . .    cuz I spent a leeeeeetle too much time reading other blogs yesterday, and not enough time doing work! =)   I'm glad to see  I'm not the only one who's cat(s) speak(s) to them.  Although mine aren't quite as sophisticated - they aren't into Russian literature or anything of that sort.  I'm ashamed to admit that one of my two cats, Tigger, actually takes after me to an extent.  He gets quite upset if you don't voluntarily pay attention to him within the first few minutes of arriving home.  He will approach me when I first walk in, but if I don't cuddle him right away, he walks away in the hopes that I'll eventually miss him and seek him out. =)  Which I usually do.  I'm not the type to seek out attention, but I have been known to get upset (mainly with the bf) if I'm being ignored, and walk off in the hopes that someone will miss me, and then I'll feel better.  Twisted, yes, I know.   The other, Jazz, is a loud mouth.   Talks back all the time.  He's always telling me off for not keeping the food dish full enough, or not being rough enough with him (yes, he's a bit of an S&M cat . . . I'm glad he's been neutered *L*).   But neither of them  have the dexterity for typing, nor do I have a computer at home (yet), so perhaps that's a good thing.  I wouldn't want the entire world knowing what my cats think of me. =)   Off topic  - any opinions out there about how soon is too soon to consider buying property with someone you're not married to?  I have my own, I'm just curious to see some others . . .

      G*ddamn bloody car shops.  How the hell I can be told that, after paying $900 for repairs and driving my vehicle less than 20 km before having to take it in again, I have no recourse . . . bullsh*t.  I can't drive the bloody thing.  I can't sell it.  I still owe $2700 for repairs to it.  Don't be telling me tough luck.  Tough luck was cracking the cylinder head.  The rest is NOT tough luck.  G*ddman bloody car shops.

       I'm so impressed . . .  I was very nervous about bringing my cats over for a visit this weekend.     After 2 weekends  of letting them get used to the place, we decided that it was time to take the next step and introduce my boyfriend's cat.  One of my cats, Tigger, is very defensive - he'll back himself into a corner, and then hiss and swipe at anyone who comes by, including me and his "brother".  But it went extremely well.  I think Stupid (boyfriend's cat) sees them as new playmates.  She was doing exactly what she does to new people.  If she likes you, she play-stalks you. =)  Waits until your back is turned, sneaks up, and often playfully bats at you.  It's all quite amusing. =)  But if she doesn't like you, she just avoids you.  And she was doing the stalking thing to my cats, luckily without the batting (that probably wouldn't have gone over well).  Minimal growling from my cats, none from Stupid, no hissing, and no fights.  I'm encouraged. =)     I still can't believe  that there's going to be a wedding to attend this weekend - my boyfriend's brother's.  I haven't really been to a wedding since my aunt's in 2000 (for some reason, my dad's in 2001 doesn't often register in my mind when I think of weddings I've been to).  I imagine it'll be tonnes of fun. =)  I'm excited, but a little nervous.  I'm sure there will be tonnes of his relatives bugging my boyfriend about when he's going to get married.  Oh well - I suppose that's par for the course at any family function when you're not married!  And if it's not marriage you're being bugged about, then it's kids.  Funny how that is. =)   Fun stuff this week. =)

       A short one for today . . .    It hasn't been a terribly good start to the  new year at work .  Our little 3-person office operation (we have 4 field techs) has been reduced to 2.  Hopefully only temporarily.  We've got a pretty high workload for only 2 people.  Especially when those two people are a green petroleum technologist and a salesman. =)  At any rate,  my eye seems to be healing well  - it's just a scratch, and it's not infected - but still no contacts for at least a week.  Grrrrr.  I hate glasses.  Especially these ones.  I managed to scratch up one of the lenses (I'm not exactly diligent about protecting them) quite badly, and it leaves a blurry spot in the middle of my field of view.  Plus, they're always sliding down my nose (had to do with the type of nose-piece), and are just darn uncomfortable.  Oh well - I'll suck it up. =)  I'd rather wear glasses than go blind because I didn't take care of my eyes!   I'm glad it's Friday . . .  two real days off.  You can call them holidays, but when you have to visit family all day long, or drive from place to place to visit family, it's just not much of a break.  It'll be nice to have a couple of lazy days off.   And exciting times ahead . . .  the bf and I are moving in together.  I know some people disapprove of this trend (my mother's included in that category), but for me, it's just part of a growing relationship.  The step that comes before marriage, sometimes by a couple of years.  There are many good arguments for and against living together before marriage - personally I don't see anything wrong with it, so long as both parties are mature enough to realize what they're getting into, and do it wisely.  I'm looking forward to it - it'll take some work and require being a little more diligent about not letting little issues fester, but I think it'll be a good thing.  So I've got some packing to do over the next little while. =)

       As for today . . .     I was woken up  around 3am this morning by stabbing pains in my eye.  Now, a little history.  I wear contacts.  Not just any contacts, but those new Night&Day ones, that you keep in for 30 days, and then replace.  No taking them out at night.  They've been pretty good up until recently.  On Sunday morning, I noticed my left eye was red.  It had been mildly irritated lately, but I figured it was probably just a burst blood vessel or something - not something I could do much about.  But when it got worse by noon, I took them out and resorted to my glasses (which I hate wearing - always have, always will).  Since I could still open my eyes the next morning, no problem, I figured it wasn't as serious as an infection, but left them out another day just in case.  I had intended to see the doctor, but the time just wasn't there.  It looked better by Tuesday, so I put my contacts back in, and didn't have any problems until this morning.   It was excruciating,  as far as eyes go.  The pain was stabbing, it wouldn't stop tearing, and I couldn't open it cuz the air made it hurt more.  My nose was running constantly (I have concrete proof that your eyes and nose are directly connected! *L*), and I couldn't sleep.  So I finally caved and went to the doctor this morning.  She put this weird dye in my eye to make sure I didn't scratch or damage my cornea (I didn't luckily) . . . it looked dark red on the stick, and made my tears turn bright yellow.  10 minutes later, my runny nose was the exact same color. *L*  There's my proof. =)  She thinks it's just a scratched eye, and is going to check again tomorrow to make sure there's no infection.  Between my lid being swollen half-shut, my eye itself being red, and a bit of yellow residue under my eye from the dye, I look like I picked a fight a lost miserably. *L*  At least no one can doubt me for why I was late today!   One of these days  I oughta screw up my courage and go get surgery done . . . no more contacts or glasses would be heaven! =)

       (continued)   And as anyone following this blog knows . . .  I bought my first new car. =)   I'm still riding the high from that one.  I'm glad I'm taking to the manual much more quickly than I'd thought I would.   There have been some good times  with friends, but unfortunately some not-so-good ones too.  Some have different lifestyles and tastes, which makes finding common activities somewhat difficult.  Some have fallen by the wayside.  Some I've made an effort with, others I haven't.  I've also been reminded of the fact that I have a wondeful and loving extended family, and that I don't see them nearly often enough.  I went to New Years' dinner at my aunt's, and she was so happy to have everyone together that she was misty-eyed during the toasts.  How I ever figured I was lacking in the family department, I'm not quite sure. =)   It's been quite a year . . .  and I'm looking forward to the possibilities that 2003 holds!

       A Year in Review . . .    Seeing as yet another half-day (more on that later) is going by so slowly, I think I can afford a little time to look back on 2002 . . .    The first part of 2002  was fraught with personal problems.  I was definitely not getting along with my brother as a roommate, and I take part of the blame for that.  Still, it was not an ideal living arrangement, and we fought constantly during the little time I was actually home.  I spent most of my time over at my boyfriend's, which wasn't the greatest thing for us at the time, either.  He was sympathetic and very accomodating, but a new relationship needs time to grow without that kind of pressure.  We had our problems over the summer, but eventually started seeing each other again, for which I am glad.  I am very happy at the moment. =)   Thanks to long distance  and sporadic communication, my father stopped talking to me when I moved out of the apartment I shared with my brother.  Although he was covering my share of the rent (long story - I was still in school), it was apparently still a huge deal for me to be leaving 8 months into a year-long lease.  It wasn't as if I was forcing my brother to leave as well . . . but the end result of the matter is that my father no longer speaks to me.  Oddly enough, the harshest words were exchanged between my brother and I, and we are now back on pretty good terms.   One family member down . . . one gained.   My grandpa moved to the city from Sherwood Park (Edmonton area) in October.  Though I have yet to see his place, it's nice to know he's in the city with the rest of his family.  He suffered some very difficult times health-wise, and I'm glad he's closer now, and I'm hoping he's got many more good years to go before his time is up.   I graduated from school . . .  this is an accomplishment that has been 5 years in the making.  It's too bad I don't have a bachelor degree to show for those 4 years (I only have a diploma, and I took a year off after 2 years at university), but at least I have something.  I love learning, but I definitely don't miss the homework, or the exams, or the late nights stressing over whether or not everything would get done in time.  I miss the comraderie of seeing the same 20-odd people 5 days a week.  The shared commiserating over beers after a particularly grueling day.  And strangely enough, I sometimes miss the craziness that was my last 2 months.  I had just moved out on my own, I was trying desperately to maintain the 20 hours a week required at work in order to qualify for a scholarship (not to mention, making enough to cover rent), and at school we had 16 weeks' worth of material in 3 classes crammed into 6 weeks.  For the most part, I'd wake up Monday morning and go to school from 8-3.  From 3-5 I'd be downtown working on a project, then I would go home and sleep until 11pm.  Then I'd work 12am-7am, and head back to school for 8am.  I'd sleep when I got home in the afternoon sometime between 4 and 6pm, and this would continue until Friday morning.  Then I would have 3 semi-normal days.  But I'd still be at school for most of Friday and Saturday, since I needed use of a computer for homework and didn't have one at home.  And the schedule was further complicated by being quite sick once or twice, sleeping at night, then switching back to sleeping in the afternoons but not being sleepy.  I'm sure this makes absolutely no sense. =)  But sometimes I miss that craziness.  Only cuz it gave me an excuse for doing a half-assed job of stuff. *L*   I got my first apartment . . .  though it was tough at first, because I was still in school, I managed.  I learned that, much as I always wanted my own place, I really miss having company.  In the 8 months I've been on my own, I just do not enjoy spending more than a few hours at a time at home alone.  Growing up, I had 3 brothers and plenty of (sometimes unwanted! *s*) company.  I like my own space - and I LOVE being able to walk around in the buff - but I get lonely easily. =)

        Sharing is good, isn't it?    Someone shared a cold/flu with me (don't know who, the dastardly so-and-so), and me being the generous person I am, have now shared it with my boyfriend.  Misery loves company, no? =)  So we're spending a very pathetic Friday night on the couch, taking turns dosing off and loading up on medication.  His and hers.  I prefer the kind that comes in a pill (or Nyquil, when it's time to sleep - that stuff's the bomb!!), he prefers drinking NeoCitrin until he turns yellow.  I can't stand the stuff.  I feel a little sad.  A good friend of mine got some great news today and wanted to go out and celebrate.  Sadly, most of her friends that she called were sick, including us.  And since the one other couple joining her hadn't been sick yet, I decided I'd put an end to my generosity.  For now.  I kept my germs to myself and passed up on dinner.  Even though it was Luciano's.  That was painful. =)  Perhaps another night.  In happier news, we have blueprints to sign off on!  I'm glad I've exposed to drafting (mandatory course at school), otherwise I'd be completely lost.  And luckily, my imagination seems to be returning from a very long vacation, so I'm not as clueless anymore when it comes to picturing how things will look in 3D.  Wonder if I'll get any more traffic since  urlLink Desiree's  mention in her blog.  Oh my, oh my, visitors!!  I'd better spruce up the place and start putting some effort in . . . =)

        Dealing with Family    Families can be tough to deal with.  Especially when children grow up.  We develop our own set of values, because no matter how much our parents would like to think differently, we are all individuals.  We develop an identity separate from our parents and our family, but we are still connected.  When disagreements occur, it is a touchy issue.  With most other people (friends, boyfriends, etc), there's always the thought in the back of our heads that "There are tonnes more people out there".  But family is family.  They're yours and you're theirs as long as you live.  I've mentioned before that my father and I don't speak anymore.  He's moved away to be with his wife, and it's easy to forget about him.  It sounds callous, but it's a reality.  He was there for me once when I really needed someone, and for that I'm grateful.  But the odd little reminder still hurts - that he could have regular contact with one of his four children, less regular contact with two more, and virtually none with the fourth.  I suppose with four kids, it can be easy to play favorites.  I always feared disappointing him.  Perhaps I still do, but without him around, it's not something I think about.  And more recently, I fear disappointing my grandpa greatly.  My grandpa is very special to me.  I know I don't show it anywhere near often enough, but he is.  He is the best grandpa ever.  Even in the bad times when I was younger, he was never stingy with compliments.  He made me feel like a bit like a princess, and in a house full of boys and with a father that was obvious about his favorites, that was a feeling to be treasured.  When I was six, he made - by hand - this huge doll house for me.   For me.   Complete with tiny furniture and the sides of the house swung open so I could play inside.  My favorite part was the bathroom on the second floor at the front of the house.  Even for a child's hands, it was difficult to get into that bathroom. But the toilet had a pull-chain to flush it.  Of course it didn't really flush, but to a child with an imagination, it was heaven.    Whenever I see him (which is far too little), he always compliments my hair, and makes a big deal of how gorgeous it is.  I know I'm not the prettiest thing on the block, but my hair has always been my one vain spot.  You can see why I love my grandpa. =)  He's old-fashioned, my grandpa.  I want so badly to go and see him, but I worry that news about my life would disappoint him.  While I am very happy with recent developments, I'm not sure how he would take it.  When my grandpa was young, people got married, then lived together, then had kids, and then they died.  He worships my grandma and her memory.  I don't know if he'd understand how things are different for me.  Sometimes I feel like even my mum doesn't.  She has been very good about keeping lectures and disapproving looks to a minimum, but I know how she feels.  People shouldn't live together before they get married.  And I don't blame her much - after my last break up, I even declared myself that I wouldn't live with another man unless marriage was a very near reality.  But since then, my views have changed.  So long as my boyfriend and I are on the same level and still agree on important issues, I don't see a problem with moving ahead with our lives sans a ring and a proposal.  But I worry that my grandpa won't agree with me.  That he'll think I'm an irresponsible girl who just follows what everyone else is doing.  And that would tear me apart.  I don't want to lose my princess status with my grandpa.  Because one day, when I do decide that I'm good and ready for marriage, I want him to be the one who offers me to my husband-to-be.  Sorry, dad, but it's how I feel.  I've been reluctant to share my happy news with most of my family.  I worry that they'll all feel the same way, and then I will always have to face the veiled disappointment in their eyes.   Why do the opinions of our family matter so much to us?   Because no matter what, we love them and no matter what, we're stuck with them.

        Pointless as it is . . . I shall continue, I suppose.    Ahhhh . . . I love living  5 mins from work.   I swear, there's some valid truth to our new building at work being haunted/cursed.  We've had one death in the 6 months we've been there, 2 break-ins, it's still not complete (no lights or company sign on the outside - numerous little things on the inside) and everyone's always crabby and short with everybody else.  That's why I like being able to come home.  I can eat lunch and lounge around, watch TV, or like today, blog.  Without worrying over getting in trouble.  I can be anti-social without worrying about what the other women might think of me.  I've cut down on the little socializing I used to do at work - I just don't have anything in common with anybody, most of the time they're grouchy (and I always tend to take that personally), and I just have too much work to do.  I hope I can move upstairs with my real co-workers soon.  They're much better (coincidentally, they're also men).  Why are we women so  competitive  amongst ourselves?  I mean competitive in the broadest sense of the word.  For the most part, we're more likely to be bitchy towards other women than towards men.  Why is this?  Guys have an argument or a disagreement, and a few silent days/weeks or good punches later, all is forgiven and forgotten.  Not so with us.  We'll hold grudges forever.  There's a reason this phrase persists:     "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."    Oh well, on to happier topics.  The worst part is upon us: waiting.  My bf and I went to the carpet/flooring store yesterday and spent over an hour deciding what the rest of the house would look like.  Now, this had plenty of potential for some nasty results.  This being our first house, and really, the first real "our" place at all, we have never decorated together.  I moved into his apartment, and seeing as he was already set up, I can't be bothered to try changing anything.  So now we have the task of deciding  together  how we want this house to look.  Exterior colours was a tad painful.  My imagination has been in hibernation mode for a long time, and tiny little colour cards did not help much when it came to picturing what the house would look like.  So we drove around to the houses that were finished and decided on something we could live with.  Appliances were a lot easier.  It's either black or white.  And we'd both agreed that white cupboards and black appliances would look really sharp.  But yesterday was the toughest of all.  There was carpet.  Not only colour, but texture, pile height, and material.  Polyester tends to be stain-resistent; nylon wears forever.  One type of texture shows a change in colour when the nap changes (you know, the light and dark streaks when you vacuum?) . . . the others aren't quite as soft.  My bf wanted a lighter colour, something neutral.  I love darker colours, especially green and blue.  Since we're also keeping resale in mind with all these decisions, we compromised with gray.  Sounds pretty boring, but it's actually a really warm colour.  It has more character to it than beige or tan, but is more neutral than green or blue.  But that wasn't it.  Oh no, far from it.  Then there was lino.  That was very simple.  There was a sample sitting out on the floor, the saleslady asked if we liked, and we both agreed right away.  It had the nice large squares, which make the room seem bigger.  That was quick.  Then countertops.  Complicating matters was the fact that I had this showhome kitchen in my head that I was trying to recreate.  Well, I don't have a perfect memory, and in the face of thousands of different designs and colours, it's easy to lose sight of how everything will look when it's all done.  But we settled on that fairly quickly, too.  A medium charcoal speckled pattern that went well with all the colours picked so far.  Next was kitchen tiles.  Oh man, that was the worst.  The saleslady pointed out their wall with the tiles that came standard.  Within one second flat, I said "nope".  None of them would do.  They all looked like bathroom tiles.  I didn't want my kitchen looking like a bathroom.  I must have looked through all the samples, and tried to explain to her what was in my head, before realizing that what I wanted was just not there.  Or if it was, it was going to cost too much.  After much deliberation, we finally went with another dark colour in a large tile.  Messes will be easy to camouflage in our kitchen. =)  Don't worry, when it's all done, I will see what I can do about putting pictures up so this all makes sense.  You'd think we were done, but the bathroom tiles were separate (obviously).  Those got picked out fairly quickly.  A creamy matte tile with an etched one randomly inserted every 10 tiles.  Ohhh, boy.  And then grouting colour for each tile pattern, edging for carpet-to-lino transitions, and lino-to-lino where the back steps meet the kitchen.  All in all, I think it's going to look very nice.  It's going to be so hard waiting for it to be done!

        This blog is pointless.     I can't say what's really on my mind, because I'd get people in trouble.  Or myself.  Cuz who knows who's reading this?  And I'm good enough at getting myself into trouble without the help of the internet.  I've got nothing terribly interesting or note-worthy or insightful or discussion-worthy to say.  So really, what's the point?  If only I could remember where I packed my journal . . . I'm about to burst.

        The ramblings of the slightly deranged      Inspiration comes in many forms.   Today, it came in the form of a peanut butter cookie with the fork tine indentations from Tim Hortons.  It's just not a peanut butter cookie without the indentations.  Perhaps I should start looking for non-edible sources of inspiration. =)  Actually, my friends serve as sources of inspiration, too.  In case you couldn't tell from the whining in my last post, I get restless when I don't see them often enough.  I have  all kinds of friends  . . . ones I value deeply, and try to see on a regular basis; ones I value deeply but, for one reason or another, don't keep in regular touch with (and it saddens me); ones that I'm friends with more out of convenience than anything else; and ones that have fallen by the wayside over the years, for whatever reason.  They all provide inspiration in some form or another.  A girl can't be all about  work and a relationship.   Don't get me wrong - I love both my job and my boyfriend and my life with him.  But there's got to be more to a girl than just this.  She's gotta have outside interests and activites, otherwise work and relationships become stale and uninteresting.  It took me a while to learn this lesson.  This time around, I think I finally understand, but boy is it hard work.  Everyone has different schedules, different priorities, different likes and dislikes and expectations.  It's what separates us and brings us together all at once.   Despair and loneliness  have got to be the absolute worst emotions for a human being.  Thank goodness I haven't felt either in a long time.  Last night's episode of  Friends  was rather depressing.  They don't often have depressing shows.  If a guy and girl really love each other, how can they be so stubborn about an opinion that often changes throughout life?  How could Mike insist that he'd  NEVER  get married again and would  NEVER  change his mind about it.  And Phoebe wanting to eventually get married and be a Volvo-driving soccer mom . . . wow, that came out of left field.   Friends  will never be the same for me. =)  Phoebe used to be my hero - she was such an unusual and ecclectic character, always marching to her own drum, not letting other people's opinion change who she was.  I don't have my own drum, much less my own march to go with it.  I care too much what other people think of me.  Sometimes I wonder if there's ever been an original thought in my head, or if my whole life has been one long imitation and integration of all the people I've known.  Come to think of it . . .  is anything ever truly original?   Ideas are always built on something . . . theories are based on disproving an established idea . . . it all has to start from something.  If it's derived from something else, it's just a twist, an expansion, a deviation.  It's not truly original.  So where did the first human being get his/her ideas from?   Do I think too much?   Yes, methinks so.  It's my curse in life.  Do I ever think about anything useful or practical?  No, not really.  I need  inspiration  in order to keep these  deranged thoughts  at bay . . . woohoo!  I have one more cookie left . . .    I can tell it's going to be a productive day . . .

       Hmmmm,  my first post from home .  Wow, and I have absolutely nothing of value to say.  Wait a minute - I never have anything of value to say.  That's never stopped me before!  But it is tonight.  Maybe I need to get the ball rolling by  visiting with my friends  . . . I always seem to yap non-stop when I'm out with them!  I feel like such an attention hog . . .   So yeah - friends, it's your duty to get together with me this Friday!  Especially since our medical friend will have  written her big exam  and maybe might want join us?????????   Hmmmmmm????????     Yappy Girl + No Yapping = Boring Girl!

        Happy Valentine's Day!     Yes, it's a Hallmark money-making scheme . . . yes, it's all commercial . . . but let's just spread the love, shall we? =)  I think it's great excuse and/or reminder to pamper yourself or someone else.  Sure, the gesture means more on any other day, but that doesn't mean that it's not special because it's February 14th.  You don't need to go all-out or super-romantic . . . the smallest gesture will do if it's genuine.  I don't think I'm terribly needy when it comes to romance, but I've had some stinky Valentine's Days.  A simple card or even an e-card would have been enough for me, but alas, even that was too much effort, it seemed.  Luckily, no disappointments so far with the current bf.  In fact, I'm excited about our date this year.  OK, maybe I'm making too big a deal of it.  But I'm excited nonetheless.  We're going out to a dinner theatre with some other couples.  I've never been to a dinner theatre before.  You know what?  To be honest, I think single people have it good when it comes to Feb. 14 . . . there's no one to disappoint you, and often the best parties on V-day are 'singles-only.'  I don't recall ever being disappointment on Valentine's Day when I was single.  Regardless, I hope everyone out there has a good day today, whether you're single, coupled-up, broke, or rolling in it!  Enjoy some good company and leave the chocolates til tomorrow - they'll be half price! *L*

        I also love reading blogs!     I've really got to get around to  putting some links  on here.  I only have about half a dozen blogs that I visit on a regular basis, but it would be nice to acknowledge them here.  Soon, soon . . . =)  The offer to purchase the house and lot has finally been firmed up!  Now we get to do the fun stuff . . . picking out our exterior colors, carpets, appliances, and later the cabinets and countertops.  And waiting . . . but that's not as much fun.   My goodness . . .  I'm listening to the news, and I'm reminded of that whole adoption website fiasco.  Who's brilliant idea was that?  Boy, that definitely wasn't thought through properly.  There are just so many potential problems with that - the least of which being that the kids could get teased by classmates.  What about pedophiles?  If the average grade school kid can get on that website, what's to stop them?  Yes, let's victimize these children even more . . . At least make the thing private.  Only give out access to couples/parents who have shown a serious interest in adoption and would like to look into it further.  Really, seriously . . . who came up with that idea and only half developed it?  OK, my rant is over for now.  Back to the house . . . =) . . . On tonight's agenda is a visit to the appliance store . . . I want all black ones for the kitchen!

        I love rollercoasters     Yesterday was yucky.  Not a good day.  Today,  I'm excited!   I'd be bouncing off the walls if I wasn't at work.  I'm trying very hard to contain myself, cuz I've got so much work to do.  But I can sneak in this little break. =)  We got it!  We got it!   WE GOT IT!   It's conditional for now, but it's enough.  I have the papers to prove it. =)  OK, I shouldn't get so excited, because there's still plenty that could go wrong in the next six months or so . . . but we can finally get the balling rolling on the house!!!  Gosh darn,  it's gonna be hard waiting  another 30-45 days to see any activity on the lot, but I will sleep so much better knowing that it's being planned.  And I think my bf will, too.  Neither of us slept well last night with not having an answer.  Hehehe . . . pretty soon I can start picking out colours, and cupboards, and carpet, and all that fun stuff.  Oops, I mean WE can. *L*   Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay . . .  maybe I'd better go get some lunch before I bounce out of my seat!

       My two cents about Joe    I've changed my mind about who Joe should pick.  Neither.  In the long run, I just don't think either woman would suit him.  But what do I know - I'm just some anonymous girl watching a TV show, right?  But I don't care . . . I shall voice my opinion.  If it weren't for the money, I would definitely say he should go for Sarah.  She's attractive, funny, sweet, and just a little bit bold when it comes to making a move - just like Joe's discovered himself.  But ohhh, those comments about money, and status . . . they're just too bothersome.  I don't think she'd like him as much if she knew he didn't have money.  And then there's Zora.  So sweet and innocent-seeming it gives me a toothache sometimes.  In all honesty, I would find it hard to be around her in real life . . . that whole Disney movie comment was right on the money. =)  She's hardly shown any physical affection towards Joe.  If I were a guy (or a girl in the reverse situation), I would have a really hard time - no matter how sweet and nice the person was - continuing with someone who could barely manage an PG13-rated kiss.  Then again, maybe the cameras have something to do with it.  I've heard many times that it's the quiet ones you have to watch out for.  And then there's the surprise twist.  The bf and I were speculating about this last night.  Perhaps it's that he really has made millions working construction.  That's plausible . . . I always thought there was good money in manual labour jobs, especially construction.  Perhaps the girl he chooses turns him down when she finds out about the money (or lack of).  Maybe he doesn't choose either.  Maybe he's gay (although I would be sorely disappointed if that were the case).  Maybe the girls are lesbians. *L*  Now I'm getting carried away.  Ohhhh, I can't wait for next Monday!  And on Sunday, there's the 90-minute Simpsons episode!!  Naw, I'm not a big TV-watcher . . .

        Waiting . . . waiting . . . always waiting . . .      Why does it seem like I'm always waiting for something?  Waiting to do something with my car . . . waiting for final approval on the mortgage . . . waiting for the next payday . . . waiting for this . . . waiting for that.  Will there ever be a time when I'm not waiting for something?  There are two things in life that I can say with confidence that I hate - waiting, and not knowing.  Just give me a freakin' answer!!!!

        University = Smart?    My parents brought me up - subtly and perhaps unaware of what they were doing - to think that university was for smart people.  Only those who couldn't cut it at university resorted to college or a technical school.  Which is why it took me nearly 3 years to figure out that SAIT was a better fit for me than university.  I felt like a failure, like I wasn't smart enough or disciplined enough.  But I soon changed my opinion.  I was much happier and a much better student at SAIT than at university.  Still . . . I miss my university years.  There was just something very . . .  elitist  . . . and  hip  . . . about going to university.  It reeked of academia, but also of mischief.  Anyone who's been there knows about the antics that go on between management and engineering.  Two such opposite areas of study.  There was always a competition as to which one could pull the wackiest stunts.  My theory was those who study hard, play harder.  And engineering is definitely one of the more demanding studies.  But management . . . *L*  (no offense to those who might have been in it . . . )  There was always  something  going on at university.  Perhaps there were too many distractions - it was easy to see how some people literally lived there even without renting a dorm room.  I miss those days.

       Fun stuff . . .   See, I'm getting  fancier and fancier  with every entry . . . Anyways, I'll quite marveling at myself. =)   The Everything To Do With Sex  show is in town this weekend.  You can be sure I'll be heading over there for a look-see with the boyfriend sometime.  Hopefully tomorrow.  It was pretty fun last year - I went with a bunch of girlfriends.  It's true that you pay $5 or $10 to peruse items you could purchase in any adult store.  But there's a little more to it than that.  There's often a couple of specialty booths that sell stuff you can't get in stores (or that are hard to find) . . . like the adult-version jolly jumper!  That thing looks scary and fun all at the same time . . .    Plus, it's the atmosphere.   There's still a bit of a taboo on anything sex-related, so it's almost kind of naughty.  Tonight is costume night . . . leather or lace and you get in free, I think.  No thanks - I don't have my bikini figure yet, so you won't catch me dead in leather or lace in public.  Not that I own anything leather, sadly.  I have to work on my costume collection. =)  And tonight was supposed to be a  reunion of sorts .  I wanted to get our little uni group out for some good ol' girly fun . . . but I just found out that it's another friend's birthday.  Seems everything happens on one weekend, and then there's nothing to do for the next three . . .   I'm hoping we can still  get together for a little while , and then go to the birthday party.  There were some pretty cool times during that first year of university.  Hyper Friday afternoons/nights spent at a coffee shop, and then maybe dinner, and then the odd trip to Edmonton during reading break . . . they were just good carefree times.  Not that I'm complaining about my life right now . . .    OK, I'll stop rambling.   The long and short of it is this - it promises to be a good weekend, and I'm looking forward to it.  Life is good.   Now if only Desiree  could come back soon so I can get comments again . . . =)

      Until I can take a little more time for a real entry, here are links to two online diaries that I'm addicted to.  It took me a couple of weeks to catch up from the beginning (I stumbled on them about 8 months ago) . . . but I tune in every week for a new entry . . .   On Tuesdays, check out  urlLink  Diary of He  .  On Fridays, there's an update on the fictional Valerie Ryan on  urlLink  Diary of V  .  It's like a mini soap-opera for your coffee break. =)   Yay, I figured out how to do links - see, I told you I was getting there! =)

       Dreams   I had a very  weird dream  last night.  I don't usually remember my dreams, but if I do, they often don't make any sense when I recount them after waking.  I dreamt last night that I  went to the movies  with my bf.  Nothing unusual there.  But we had a dog with us (in real life, we only have two cats).  Apparently they had special showings in which dogs were allowed, but the one we wanted to see wasn't one of them.  No biggie - we sweet-talked out way into the movie, and found that a few other lucky people had done the same.  There were a couple of other dogs in the theatre.  I told you  my dreams were always weird . =)  Anyways,  the dog was behaving itself  for the most part, but my bf started getting bored with the movie.  He started barking. *L*  So of course, our dog joined in, and so did the others, much to the dismay of the other movie-goers.  I can't remember if we got kicked out, but I'm sure we must have.   I must have been rich  in this dream, cuz later that same day, I went to the movies again.  This time it was with my mum.  No dogs this time.  None in the theatre either, so it must have been a no-dog showing. =)  Except this time, we sat beside two women who were holding hands.  The larger one of the two took an immediate interest in my mum and kept asking her questions and trying to steal her away from me.  So we eventually moved a few rows down.  I don't remember how it ended.  I've given up trying to figure out if my  dreams mean anything .  The odd time there's been an obvious meaning - like the dream where I was in a car driven by an ex and it kept getting smaller until I fell out - but most of the time, I believe it's just my brain getting rid of garbage.  And since I'm not terribly creative in waking life, I figure that's why they're extra weird. =)   I'm very tired this week.   I hope I'm not getting sick.  My 'sick' dream always freaks me out.  It's always the same one - I'm in a huge, blindingly-white room with no real boundaries or walls, and there are hoards of little creatures chasing me from one end to the other.  I can never see them, but I'm terrified in the dream and when I wake up.

       Joe Millionaire   What else is there to talk about today? =)  I was praying that  Zora  would be one of the two to make it this week.  She's down-to-earth and obviously not about the money.  She seems awfully innocent, but as Melissa mentioned yesterday "Perhaps there's more to her than we know."  Zora reminds me an awful lot of my friend Daisy. =)  I think Joe will be  sorely disappointed  should he choose to reveal his secret to Sarah.  She's cultured (or puts on a darn good act) and takes pleasure in the finer things in life.  While this seems to fascinate Joe, I don't think it has long-term potential.  And I think Sarah will have trouble hiding her disgust if/when she finds out there's no $50M.  Zora, on the other hand, might be very upset by the deceit itself and not the lack of money.  That could be a problem, but if she really likes Joe and vice versa, I think there's hope.    Joe is so yummy.   =)  Mmmm, mmmmm, mmmm.  How the heck he hasn't been snatched up yet is beyond me.  Maybe there's more to this money thing than us women are willing to admit.    Well, you can be sure I'll be  tuning in eagerly  next week!

      Hmmm . . . upon reviewing that last post, it occurred to me . . .    What's happened to the imaginations of kids these days?   I have many friends who agree - when we were young, the only TV we watched was Saturday morning cartoons (and they were  GOOD  cartoons, not the crazy nonsense on YTV these days) so our parents could sleep in, and maybe the odd show or two after school.  But we didn't have Nintendos or PS or X-box or internet for the longest time . . . so we had to amuse ourselves.  We'd complain of being bored to our parents, and they'd simply say "well, find something to do then."  And then we came up with games or crafts or projects by ourselves.  Refrigerator boxes were the ultimate, empty toilet rolls and paper bags had endless possibilities . . .   I don't know many primary-school-aged children who  play like this anymore.   Granted, I don't know all that many children in that age range, but still.  Are they losing something in having their entertainment provided for them?  It makes me wonder . . .    Perhaps I'm naive,  but if I ever have children, I'd like them to be able to see the potential in every day house-hold items.  It's gotta be expensive having kids even without all the gadgets and new-fangled electronic toys . . .   Yeesh, I sound like a grandparent or something . . . "Well, in  MY  day we had to walk blah blah blah blah . . . " *L*

       I  used  to be creative . . .    I'm just not quite sure what happened. =)   When I was young,  it was great having four kids in the family.  Well, OK, it was great when my younger brothers got old enough to play with.  The youngest is almost 7 years younger than me, so it was a while before we all played together.   We used to put on plays  for my parents and any unsuspecting guests who might happen to be over at the time.   I was director, producer, and often the star  as well.  But of course my brothers were involved - no fun being a director if there's no one to direct! =)  We made sure my mum got the big brown paper bags when she shopped, since we were the perfect size for using those as costumes.  We'd cut out a hole for our head (usually the whole bottom flap) and holes for our arms.  Most often, we were Carebears . . . but not always.   And we would do skits.     Based on this apparently  outgoing and show-offey nature , I don't understand why I had performance anxiety at piano recitals just a few years later.  I guess I probably was (am? *s*) a  bossy older sister  . . . during long-past summers, my brothers and I would keep ourselves amused by playing school.  It wasn't enough that we were in school for real the rest of the time . . . play school was fun, because I was in control.  =)  It goes without saying that I was always the teacher, and my brothers were always the students.  I could be wrong, but I don't recall any strong objections on their part.  I loved being in charge, and giving them assignments (yes, they actually got homework, and they actually did it!) and then marking them.  You'd think I would have felt a stronger calling as a teacher, but it's one profession I've never even bothered considering.   And yet, many years later  when I was to teach piano lessons to a handful of children, it was something I almost dreaded at times.  I wasn't strict at all, and as such, not many of my students progressed as far or as fast as they could have or should have.  After 3 years, I decided that I was not doing these children any favors, and got out of it (it also helped that that was the same time I moved into an apartment where I couldn't keep a piano any longer).   Should I ever have children of my own,  I think it's something I might go back to (teaching piano), albeit with a different attitude.  It's an ideal parttime job for a stay-at-home mom.  I remember when I  first started playing  the piano.  Boy, is this entry ever wandering! =)  Oh well, I'm rolling with it . . .    I actually started out in singing lessons.   Obviously, my singing teacher had a piano that she used regularly during our lessons.  It wasn't long before curiosity got the better of me and I asked her to show me how to play the piano as well.  It was only a matter of months before she'd taught me all she felt comfortable with, and had to suggest another teacher to my parents.  I wish I'd been able to do both - singing and piano - but my parents couldn't afford both.  But I went far with the piano . . . for anyone who's familiar with classical music training  (RCM) , I completed Grade 10 before I finished high school, and attempted to begin my teaching degree/diploma (performance - the other option - definitely wasn't my cuppa tea) when I started university, but it proved to be too much.  One day, I'll complete it . . .   Well, I could keep going on this  memory lane , but at nearly 24 years, it could be a while before it runs out . . . =)  So I'll leave it at that for now.  I like reminiscing.  I have lots of good memories up to about 14/15 years of age.

        A Cursed Office      At first, I chuckled to myself when someone mentioned that our new (well, 6 months old now) office building was cursed.  Then came our first accident less than 3 months after we moved in.  A man was killed when a forklift crushed him.  I don't know all the details, nor do I care to.  Although it happened in the back shop, and I was oblivious until I saw all the somber faces around the office nearly two hours after the fact, it's been my nearest exposure to such a situation.  Then today, a second "incident", just over 3 months after the first.  Thankfully, as far as I know, it wasn't fatal.  But someone had a heart attack - and nobody nearby knew CPR!  I find that absolutely incredible, given that most of the employees work in the shop out back.  To me, it would be common sense that the employer would run a First Aid/CPR course at least once a year.  And especially after the first accident.  Oh well, I'm not the employer, so who am I to say anything?  I just get interrogated about why I'm using a courier at $5/destination instead of regular post.  Ohhhhh, I sense a rant coming on . . .   One word - management.  You know what I'm talking about (unless you're in the upper management yourself . . . in which case, I would highly suggest you stop reading now) . . .  bosses.   I just have to shake my head sometimes.  Perhaps I'll understand someday if I ever become one myself, but until then, I will remain baffled.    For example . . . from what I understand, our main boss is more of a people person than a computer person.  To put it politely.  Email is a challenge.  Meanwhile, most of the office staff uses computers all day long, and a few of us run several large and complex programs.  To me, the  sensible  thing would be to spend a little extra for a computer with a faster processor, etc for the people using computers all the time.  Save a few bucks on a slightly less fancy though entirely adequate one for those only needing it for email.  Sensible, yes?  Apparently not.  The boss has not one, but  two  very fancy and expensive-looking computers at his disposal.  I have yet to see him use either.  Meanwhile, the office manager was running something equivalent to a 386 up until she moved to the reception desk, where it was determined that we couldn't have clients seeing that piece of junk as soon as they walk in.  Three people in our little corner of 4 offices got their computers stolen recently.  The thieves completely by-passed my office in favour of kicking in a door down the hall.  I'm very upset . . . those who lost their computers got fancy new Dell ones with the flat screen monitors, and I'm stuck with my old HP.  Boohoo for me . . . I'm hoping they come back and take mine. *L*  As I mentioned before, I get asked why I'm using a courier instead of the regular post.  Apparently my boss has absolutely no idea what I do.  In fact, I know he doesn't.  I make reports, and often clients want 4 or even 5 copies.  When the report is up to 60 pages long, with dividers and a data CD, I figured $5 per destination regardless of weight (within reason) was pretty darn reasonable.  I'm sure the same package would be at least $10 by regular post, and would take up to 3 days to be delivered, as opposed to a coupla hours.  And it's not as if I'm careless - I'll only call once a day, so if there are multiple reports going to the same destination, they all go out at once.  Unless, of course, the client is in a huge hurry for the data.  And the latest - I've been asked to cross-check all our field technicians' time sheets with jobs and invoices to see what we're charging out vs what we're paying them.  I thought that's what his cracker-jack CA was for.  I tried to explain to him that not all jobs are billed out by the hour - quite a few are flat job rates, and all-inclusive.  I have a sneaky feeling that if I do exactly what he asked me, and simply look up hours billed, he will come back with a million questions, and it will have to be done all over again.  And if I do read between the lines and provide him with what he really wants - easily a few days' worth of work, and we're in busy season - he will still have questions.  I don't think I like being a subsidiary company working in the same building as the parent company.  Ohhhh, there's more.  Would it not be logical to have a team working in the same area, physically?  Our little subsidiary company of 3 office and 4 field staff shares the same office building as the parent company.  Two of my co-workers are up on the second level at the back of the building.  I'm on the main floor at the front.  When we first moved in, there was an empty office right across the hall from my co-workers.  Two, in fact.  But one quickly turned into a sadly disorganized storage room, and the other for salesmen that are constantly consulting the woman in the office next to mine.  Would it not make more sense to have us switch?  I would be more than willing to spend a few hours on a Saturday to move stuff so that it didn't disrupt a regular work day.  But no - that's entirely out of the question!  I need to be downstairs with all the other women in some sort of harem or something.  So I can be at the boss's beck and call.  Phew, I'd better stop soon . . . work is over for the day, and I'll end up going in tomorrow morning very bitter!  There are a few perks that make my job worth staying at . . . I just felt like ranting about all the bad stuff today. =)

        Fame Brings Out The Critics      OK, so maybe "fame" is a strong word . . . but having had a little more traffic than usual lately (which I can only tell by new commenters - I haven't surrendered to a hit counter yet), I'm not sure I like it.  I can sympathize now with  urlLink Miss Sepi  when she took down her comments for a while.  It's all fine an dandy when the people leaving comments say nice things.  It's great!  But not everyone is going to agree with me, or like me . . . and I'm not one to take criticism well.  I can deal with it if it's someone I know, because I know if they're just bitter about something, or if there's any truth to it.  But it's a little tougher with complete strangers . . . Oh well, I'll learn to deal. =)  I'm not gonna stop blogging just cuz not everybody likes me or shares my opinions and feelings . . . that's life.

        The Continuing Saga That Is My Dodge . . .       Ah yes . . . the infamous Dodge Spirit.  Thought maybe I'd gotten rid of it, because I hadn't posted anything in a long time?  I wish!!  No, no . . . I've just successfully tried not to think about it for a long time.  Well, a few weeks anyways.  It's an entirely unpleasant situation that I would just rather not pollute my mind with.  But it's always there, and it pops up at random times.  Like yesterday.  A few weeks back, I attempt to placate the shop manager and myself by saying that I would put the car up for sale again, but leave it on his lot until it was sold.  Then he'd get paid as soon as it was, and he could be happy.  And then, should I choose to, I could take action to get my money back.  Or some of it.  But I didn't tell him that last part, of course.  About a week ago, I finally forked over a dozen dollars or so to have the ad in the Bargain Finder enhanced and run for 3 weeks - I'm horrible at remembering to call in each week to renew it.  No biters the first week.  A few missed calls on my cell where I didn't recognize the number, but nobody left a message.  Oh well, whatever.  Then yesterday - at home (I advertised my cell number) - I got a call.  At first, I couldn't figure out how on earth he got this number - and my name, to boot.  Then he explained that he saw the car at the garage, but the number on it didn't work (obviously - I moved and hadn't changed the sign).  He talked to the manager - AND THE MANAGER GAVE HIM ALL THESE DETAILS!  Gave him my home phone number, my name, and even went so far as to tell him what exactly had been done to the car and the fact (and the exact amount) that I still owed the shop money.   I was livid!   Since when can a stranger walk off the street and get all this information??  My anger bordered on feeling violated.  So, either one of two things is going to happen this weekend . . . the guy is going to call on Saturday to test drive it.  Obviously I can't let him drive it off the lot, since it's neither insured nor registered.  I will be tickled pink if he buys it.  That's the ideal option.  But if he doesn't, the car is leaving that lot, with or without the manager's consent.  I still have AMA coverage, and I'll get it towed to the bf's dad's acreage outside the city.  I went out at lunch today and got a spare key cut from the dealership, and I'll find some way of getting the club taken off.  Oh yeah - and the shop has also put a club on my steering wheel.  Once again - if you don't want to get ripped off or screwed around -  DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE TO SOUTH TRAIL CERTIGARD.   Hehehe - can I get in trouble for  un- advertising for a place?  I don't care at this point.  So - we'll see what happens.  As I said, ideally the guy figures the car is worth it and buys it.

        A New Family Member      Wow, nothing much for a few days, and then  wham! , it all comes out. *L*  No, the new member is not what you're probably thinking . . . I'm starting to really like the idea of a puppy being added to our little home unit.  I've never been a dog person . . . I'm usually nervous around strange dogs.  I'm definitely a cat person.  But hearing my boyfriend talk about how excited he is to get a puppy after we move in (and get a fence up - probably a good month or so), it's contagious.  He misses having a dog around - he grew up in a house that had a constant stream of animals.  They were like the neighbourhood animal shelter or something . . . his mom just couldn't turn anybody away, human or otherwise.  By contrast, my first experience with a pet was a hamster in grade 4.  When it died only a few weeks later, my parents replaced it, but that only lasted another 2 years.  We never had any real pets because two of my brothers were highly sensitive to animal dander/hair.  Plus, my mum was never much of an animal person, having not grown up with them either.  I've only ever had cats, besides the hamsters.  But I'm growing to like the idea of a dog.  Both our cats are very active - I think they'll get along well with a puppy once they get used to it.  And a dog has a very different personality to a cat . . . it would be nice to have a pet that you could actually train! =)  And that could accompany us to various places - camping, friends' houses, for walks, etc.  Lots of big changes coming, but they're all good as far as I'm concerned . . . =)

        Good Days      Yesterday was a good day for many reasons, despite starting it with two flat tires.  To begin with, I got invited along for a lunch meeting.  We were supposed to be meeting with 2 guys from another company to discuss some potential work, but when we got there, it was only one, and he was young.  You just can't turn down company lunches, because it's free, and it's often ritzier places than I would regularly visit.  And it means I get to go downtown - I really miss the whole downtown atmosphere and culture lately.  So, just three of us for lunch, all within a few years' range of each other.  Which meant the conversation had no trouble flowing after the business part of it was taken care of.  Indeed, although it's a little taboo, I daresay there was just a hint of flirting going on, although innocent enough.  It was fun.  No matter whether the company was lively or not, I usually come back from lunch meetings just a little hyper and definitely refreshed.  It's nice to eat a decent meal midday, and coming back around 1:30 or 2pm certainly helps the day go by faster. *L*  I was a little sad though - my bf was unusually slow at work, so I'd hoped to have lunch with him and maybe drive by the lot to check on any progress.  I called him when I got back from lunch, but he'd found something to do.  Around 3:30 I get a call from him.  Wants to know when I think I'll be done at work.  Knowing there's got to be a reason for this (he knows my hours are fairly flexible unless I've got something urgent on the go), I ask what he's got in mind.  We've been meaning to go see the house (or it's beginnings) all week.  He really wanted to go see it, and wanted to know if I'd be done work soon so we could go together.  Awwwww . . . I was so touched that he would call me first.  So of course I snuck out of work early.  No big deal - our office manager knew where I was going, and she knows how excited I am about this whole thing.  And there's a big concrete foundation now!  From nothing but a hole to a big, open concrete box in 4 days!  Probably less, because it looked like it was already drying.  I've been told that the actual structure goes up quite quickly, that it's the inside that takes the most time.  That's OK with me . . . we'll be able to occupy ourselves better in the summer, when progress will be slower.  We get a possession date when we do the framing walk-through in mid-June.  It'll likely be September, as they've been consistently a month behind on most houses lately.  I don't mind, because it gives us an extra month to save and get ready to move.  Just so long as it's still nice enough to have a great big BBQ party when we move in!  Exciting times, exciting times . . .

        Rotten Luck      Road hazards - they really suck.  Yesterday, on my drive in to work, I was merely blocks away when my car started pulling really hard to the right.  My first thought was "great, now I'm going to have to book it in for a wheel alignment or something."  But because it came on so suddenly, I feared it was something worse.  It was, and it wasn't.  I got out at work, and I decided that before I inspected the car, I'd fill up the windshield washer fluid, since the warning light had been bugging me for nearly a week.  It's one of those things I only think of doing while I'm driving - once I park, I'm so focused on what comes next that I've completely forgotten.  On my way from the trunk to the hood, I noticed the  very  flat tire on the front passenger side.  Groan.  One of only two day I decide to dress up for work, and I'm going to have to figure out how to change a tire.  Then, someone else is on their way in, when they look at my car and say "Wow, what happened there?"  I explained I must have run over something.  He said, "No kidding - you got the front AND the back!"  Sure enough, when I walk around again, both tires are flat right down to the rims.  Luckily, flat tires aren't major damage, so long as I haven't been driving long enough to warp the rims.  I don't think I did.  But silly me, I don't think terribly clearly under stress.  I had no idea how far I could safely drive once they were pumped up (thank goodness I work at an office with a shop in the back - two guys helped me pump them up so I could drive somewhere to get them fixed).  I took their suggestion of a nearby Husky station . . . there was no way I'd make it as far as the Honda dealership.  I didn't think of it until later, but I have a friend who works at a tire shop only a 5-min drive away.  I probably would have made it, but oh well.  Turns out I managed to hit the exact same nail twice in the exact same spot on both tires.  I have no idea where it happened, and can't believe I didn't notice.  Mind you, I've never driven on a flat tire before, so you can't really blame me for not noticing sooner.  So - I've officially broken in my car, literally.  Unless you count my little encounter with the garbage crate in the alley.  Sheesh, maybe I shouldn't be driving . . . at least not driving a new car! *L*

        A Winner!      Sadly, it's not me.  I won a cookie the other day (only my second prize), but that's not what I'm talking about.  A Buick Rendezvous was won from  MY  Tim Hortons!  I tell ya - the girls behind the counter are holding out on me! =)  Naw, they're all great . . . I've gotten a free coffee before, and once been charged for a medium when I had a large . . . little things like that tend to make a customer loyal.   So someday soon, there will be a Buick outside the store on display.  Cool!  As an aside, when this contest first started, and you'd mention a Buick Rendezvous to people, they'd get this confused look on their face.    "A what?"    And if you followed up with, "You know, the Tiger Woods car . . . "  . . . suddenly the light goes on.  Now  there's  effective advertising!

       Give up the grudge, you better shut your mouth, Why you gotta judge everybody but yourself?  Take a look around you, there ain't nobody home I may be a loser but at least I'm not alone.    I forget who that song's by (Wheezer?) but I love it.  There are some pretty sassy and fun new songs out lately.  "Dumb Girl" is another one I like.  I like being able to listen to the radio at work . . . just wish I could win some money!  CJay 92 is giving away $500 first thing in the morning (that gets you an entry into the contest for $10,000 to spend in one day at Chinook Centre . . . I could do that by lunch time! *L*), then $100 each hour for the rest of the work day, I believe.  The few times I actually catch what the special song is, and then hear it, the phone lines are so jammed I don't stand a chance.  The rest of the time, I'm actually paying attention to my work, so either I miss what song I'm supposed to be listening for, or I miss the song itself.  Oh well.  Something to occupy me when I'm taking a mental break at work.  It sure is fun thinking of how I'd spend $10,000 at the mall - not that I even stand a chance of entering the contest, let alone winning - but it's fun to imagine just the same.  Like imagining what you'd do if you won the lottery.  If I had $10,000 to blow in one day at the mall . . . I'd start with a new bed and plenty of bedding and pillows to go with it.  Then it would be on to the electronic store for a PS2 and an N64 (so I could get Mario Party!!) and plenty of games to keep us busy for months.  Of course I'd take my bf to Sears, and tell him to go nuts.  I might give an elliptical trainer some consideration.  And while he's in Sears, I'd be going nuts clothes shopping!!  I'd invite a few friends along for that part . . . it's more fun if you share. :)  And when we were all shopped out, I'd make sure there was enough left to buy dinner for me, my bf, and a few good friends.  I have no idea if that adds up to $10,000 or less or more . . . but that's OK.  Like I said - it's fun to imagine.

        The Evil Addictiveness That Is The Sims      Has anyone else come across this highly addictive game?  It's kinda of old by now, but they keep coming up with expansion packs - Hot Date, Livin' Large, a pets one . . . Whosever brainchild this was knew what they were doing!  I can play that game for hours and not know how much time has gone by (except Sims' time, that is!).  You control these little people, how happy they are, or even how miserable they are.  You can make them marry, have kids, renovate their home while their at work, or sleeping, or heck, even under their noses!  Anyone who denies that people are control freaks on some level is indeed in denial. *L*  I only have the basic version, none of the expansion packs yet.  This weekend I was introduced to the Hot Date version.  Now I want more!  The characters are no longer confined to their homes and the lot surrounding them . . . they can venture "downtown", and return home as if time had never passed!  If only real life was like this . . . get up an hour early for work, take a 2-day jaunt for entertainment and shopping, and still return in time to leave for work as if nothing had happened.  Can you imagine how different life would be?  I have one family that I mainly play with.  It started out with one girl . . . she was a career girl, in the police force, and I was beginning to suspect she was more attracted to females.  Yes, despite all the control you have, they will still develop their own personality with likes and dislikes.  She got along so much better with the women that came by to visit than the men.  She would interact with both, but develop a 'heart' for the women much quicker than the men.  I was getting concerned . . . I wanted her to marry so there'd be two incomes and I could make a huge house with all the fancy accoutrement.  (No, I'm not materialistic *L*).  So I created a 'family' of three men, figuring at least  one  of them had to spark her interest!  After a frustrating few 'days' - in which they would come calling and she would stubbornly stand and twiddle her thumbs instead of greeting them as I told her to do - she finally started getting to know them all.  It quickly became apparently that one stood out, and after 4 separate rejections (she proposed), she finally lucked out.  I since made them have a kid, and I'm curious to see if he ever grows to be an adult.  Anyways, it's all pointless nonsense, but I felt like blogging about it this morning.

        There's a Hole In My Bucket . . .     Well, not exactly.  There's a hole on our lot!!  I feel kinda bad cuz my bf wasn't there to see it, but I'm sure he'll drive by sometime today or maybe we'll go check it out after work today.  On Saturday, he had to work, so I took my mum to see the showhomes and made a confusing attempt to describe our home (since it isn't one of the showhomes).  I drove by the lot, and there was a hole!  It's really happening! :)  Anyways . . . calming down now . . .   And it was a pretty darn good weekend overall.  Anyone who reads Leah's blog as well knows it was her b-day celebration on Saturday.  It was pretty good fun!  I haven't been out to the bar in ages . . . so that had me excited. =)  Dinner was OK - I'm not a big Mexican fan, but I figured I'd try it.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy it, so that's good!  Then on to Coyotes.  Great fun.  They weren't playing the best mix of music, and the DJ just would NOT SHUT UP . . . but they played Eminem once while we were there, so it was all good.  I found it absolutely hilarious when I found out on the way home that two youngun's that joined our group sporadically tried to pick up my boyfriend.  I try very hard not to be the jealous type of girlfriend, because he's very honest with me and has never given me reason to be jealous.  He's goodlooking, and friendly, and has a bit of a bad-boy look that is very appealing to a lot of women (especially the younger ones) . . . so it's understandable that others might want to try to steal him away. =)  In a way, it's good, because it's easy to take someone for granted after a while, and when you go out and see other women hitting on him, it reminds you of what first attracted you to him. =)  I would love to have a girls' night out sometime soon.  Sunday was pretty darn low-key . . . despite sleeping quite late, I woke up a little grumpy, but then the bf went shooting with a buddy, and as is customary, I hung out with the wife.  I ranted a little to her, and then POOF, everything went back into perspective and I wasn't grumpy anymore.  The bf came back in a good mood (and a slurpie for me to boot!), and all was right again. =)  Exercise Log:   Friday (21st):   gym!  yay!  3 times for exercising this week!   Sat/Sun (22/23):   guilt-free days off, and very much enjoyed. :)

        Once Again, I'm Proven Wrong    Last night, I gathered together a set of tax forms and sprawled out on the floor with all my slips of paper.  I went through them manually and carefully, and it turns out it was my mistake after all.  It's rather sneaky, actually.  Last time I did taxes, there wasn't a distinction between Alberta tuition and federal tuition carryovers.  Or maybe I just never noticed.  But I'd sure like to know how they differentiate the two.  My carryover was Alberta tuition, not federal.  I'd filled out my taxes with both, not knowing there was a difference.  And it's a huge difference.  Even if it was a federal carryover, my refund would have been much more.  Oh well, I still got a sizeable one, so I won't complain.  I think I'm going to make a habit of doing my taxes manually from now on, just to make sure the computer spits out a number I agree with.  If I'd been expecting less, and received the same amount that I did, I would have been ecstatic.  But being that I expected more, it was a little disappointing.  Funny how that works, huh?  But as I mentioned - it's all extra money.  So it's all good. :)  Before next tax season, it's my goal to have an RRSP started . . . I feel I'm getting kind of old not to have started one already.

        Damn Government    Grrrrrr.  I did my taxes last week and submitted them.  The forms said I had overpaid a huge amount of taxes.  This made me very happy.  Since I have direct deposit, I've been anxiously checking my accounts every day to see if the money has arrived.  I checked this morning, and there was a huge chunk of money there, but $700 less than I'd been expecting.  And I have no idea what the deal is until the paperwork arrives, which won't be for at least another week.  Grrrrr . . . I even did the calculations on one of those fancy computer programs that do everything for you.  And just to be sure, I did a quick estimate on the paper forms, and the numbers jived.  So what gives?  This is going to nag at me until I have some answers.  I really am starting to think there's a government conspiracy . . . my bf has received several notices and letters from the government, and they're all absolutely insane.  Like he has to pay back money they never gave him in the first place.  And that he owes a ridiculous amount of money in unpaid taxes from 3 years ago, all because he was on disability leave after knee surgery and the insurance company sent the wrong form in.  But try and call the government offices, and you're greeted by someone who's not experienced enough to help you, and then you have to wait at least an hour to speak to someone who is.  Who's got an hour to sit on hold?  Craziness.  And really, what are we paying these taxes for?  They're closing schools and not opening new ones; we can't afford to pay our nurses what they deserve; our military is the laughing stock of the continent.  OK, end of rant.

        Could It Be The Moon?    I have no energy lately.  I haven't changed my bedtime (if anything, it's earlier), I haven't really changed my diet significantly, and I haven't changed my sleeping area.  But I just don't sleep well, and I wake up grumpy fairly often.  Maybe I need to flip the mattress?  Does that really work?  I've never really paid attention in the past.  I was hoping working out more often might help my energy levels, but that's so sporadic, it's hard to tell.  Maybe it is the full moon, as  urlLink Leah  suggested?  I wish I could figure it out so I could fix it.  Or blame something. *L*

        Ground-Breaking News      Literally!  They break ground and start construction on our house sometime this week!  I'm excited.  I'd started to wonder if it was really ever going to happen - all we've done so far is pick stuff out and sign millions of papers, but nothing we could actually see.  I can't wait!  I'd be willing to bet we're down there every other day after work and at least once every weekend.  We were dorks again, and took a couple more pictures, since the weather was so nice and sunny this weekend.  I'm officially a dork because I posed in one of them. *L*  Yay, yay, yay . . .

        Fridays are sweet      I hope I don't jinx it by saying so, but today is  so  good.    I'm in the best mood, finished any absolutely essential work this morning, went out for lunch with a coupla co-workers and had a great time, and it's just so gosh-darned gorgeous outside.  And in a little while, I'll leave work early to do all the deposits, and then I'm free.  And I'll be meeting up with some friends later this evening.  =)   Life is good.   It is really good.  Mostly I'm enjoying it, but a small part of me is waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak.  Something's gotta go wrong soon, it's just that good.  Or maybe it was the Prozac I got my hands on this morning.  Naw, you don't get this happy with drugs.  Are you happy?  I hope so!  If not, I'll share some of mine with you.  Have a great weekend, everyone (all 3 or 4 of you *L*)!

        And on to the subject of strip clubs      Now, I don't want to offend any of my friends who think differently, cuz I know there are some.  But I don't see anything wrong with strip clubs.  To be honest, I think ladies' night are far more degrading than the average peelers.  I think my bf was pretty proud of the fact that I had no problems going to the Speakeasy with him . . . until we found quite a few other couples who do the same thing.  In my opinion, naked women are more appealing to look at than naked men.  This certainly doesn't mean that I would rather take a girl home than a man - simply that the female form is just nicer. =)    At ladies' nights, the women are hootin' and hollerin' and making huge asses of themselves.  Not so at the peeler's.  Sure, there's some, but not to the extent that I've seen it in Dewey Steven's and the like.  For the most part, the women on stage look like they're enjoying themselves.  They're not being forced to dance, and they're making damn good money, too! =)  However, I'm only human, and on some days ('fat' days come to mind), I would rather not spend a Friday evening looking at women who are much prettier and skinnier than me.  You know, it's interesting how it's much more socially acceptable for women to do a lot of things men wouldn't even consider, sexually.  Let's start with the tame stuff.  It's perfectly OK for women to hug and flirt with and even kiss their friends.  I don't know many men that hug each other, let alone kiss.  It's just not done unless you're gay.  Women can compliment each other or make appreciative comments about goodlooking women without causing much commotion.    For the more adventurous, not many people will think a woman is disgusting or homosexual just because she's experimented on the same sex.  Yet that's the common opinion if it were a man doing the same thing.  I guess there are some pretty good things about being a woman. =)  Say, did anyone ever catch that Life Network show about switching genders?  Two men and two women spent two weeks or so creating a personality of the opposite sex and living as that person.  None of these people were considering changing their gender permanently or anything like that . . . it was just a human experiment.  It was crazy.  One of the girls cried when she had to have her hair cut . . . I don't blame her.  My hair is part of what makes me consider myself feminine.  Anyways, it was just interesting, and it made me think that I'm very happy being a woman and would never voluntarily change that!

        On the subject of flirting      I believe that flirting is a very important human behaviour.  We do it with the opposite sex, and often women do it with their friends, too.  For the most part, it's all pretty innocent, and makes everyone feel good.  I miss flirting.  After a relationship has officially entered the "long-term" zone, sure you still flirt occasionally, but it doesn't have the same effect as flirting with a stranger.  My boyfriend is definitely a flirt.  Not the schmarmy, creepy kind - he's just very friendly and social.  And this doesn't bother me.  In fact, most of the time, I hardly even notice if he's flirting with the waitress or cashier, because there's nothing disrespectful in the way he does it . . . There's some funny stories on that subject, but I'll keep that for another time.  I like to flirt, too, but it has to be the right situation.  Although it may seem cheesy, I like the attention I get when I'm out with a group of girlfriends at a nightclub or bar.  Sadly, we haven't done that in ages.  It renews my sense of sexiness to know that random men still think I'm attractive.  How did one friend put it? . . . "Reassurance that I've still got it."  I know some people, though, who think that any form of flirting with someone other than their S.O. is just plain disrespectful.  I think it all depends on how it's done.  If a guy goes out, sans his girl, and he intentionally leads other women to think he's single, and that he might go home with them - yes, that's disrespectful.  Or if he overtly ogles or makes catcalls when he's out with his girl - that's disrespectful.  These same people probably think strip clubs are degrading.  Hmmm, maybe I'll make that my next topic.

        To add a positive spin after my smoking rant . . .    I think my bf and I have found a nice and  very healthy  solution to a common complaint.  Recently, we were both lamenting - I that the only swimming pool in the city with an actual swim practice now seemed so far away; my bf that his gym now seemed so far away (he used to live just blocks away from it).  Then it occurred to me - both of these places are within a couple minutes' drive from each other.  What if we coordinated it so that we went together?   And that's what we did last night.   I was very happy.  I haven't been swimming in at least 6 months, and it's one activity that I always miss.  There's only one pool in the city that offers conditioning swim, which is basically like a drop-in swim practice, with a coach who gives a workout and everything.  I can't do the lane swim thing - I need structure and feedback.  Otherwise I get bored.  I don't have to try out, it's reasonably cheap (city pool admissions are about $5.00, I believe), and it's only 2 nights a week.  Very manageable.  And my boyfriend likes going to the gym.  For both of us, it's just a matter of getting motivated.  I hope we can keep this up.  Although I'm exhausted this morning. =)   I'm very glad we have similar views on being active.   If there's one thing that's very important to me (inherited from my mum), it's being fit, and being active with my s.o.  We don't always have to be doing something together, but it gets very hard to stay fit when you're with someone who would rather just sit on the couch all the time.  And I find it to be a very good bonding experience to do active stuff together.  To some people, it's not that important, and that's fine.  But it is to me.  So that's another good thing about my bf. =)   And one more bonus  - maybe being more active (doing the gym thing twice a week) might give him an extra little push towards quitting smoking.  I believe that he will quit one day.  I'm not holding my breath . . . and maybe he might just cut down to a few a day.  That would be fine with me.  But I think, the older he gets, the more he realizes there are so many benefits to not smoking, or at least not being a slave to smoking.  Just as an aside -  kissing my bf is nothing like licking an ashtray (not that I've ever done that).   Unless I make the mistake of kissing him when he's in the middle of a smoke, of course. =)  I'm not sure where advertisers got that idea.

        My cat is a smoker    Well, he would be if he was  human.   I really don't know how it started - most cats I've known are completely turned off by the smell of tobacco.  Not mine.   At first, it was cute.   When my boyfriend first started coming over, he'd let Tigger sniff him over, and Tigger would always linger on his cigarette hand.  Soon, the cat was feverishly licking his index and middle fingers.  And now that we've moved in, I've seen  cigarette butts  in odd places around the basement.  I've caught him chewing on them occasionally - I have yet to figure out if he actually eats them.  Yesterday, I went home at lunch to find one ashtray tipped over and butts scattered everywhere.   This can't be good for him.   I mean, smoking isn't good for humans - imagine what it must do to an animal less than a tenth of our size!  It got me to thinking - it bothers me that the cat eats cigarette butts, but how often have I thought about what second hand smoke is doing to him?  Or my boyfriend's cat?  Or to myself, for that matter?  I always figured that because I didn't live with him, it wasn't a big deal, and besides, it wasn't my place to tell him what he could and couldn't do in his own home.  But now that we do live together, it's becoming a bit of an issue for me.  When I first met my boyfriend, it didn't bother me.  For the longest time, it didn't.  But I tell ya - whenever I'm sick, and first thing in the morning, it's really harsh and irritating to not be able to get away from the smell.  That's one thing that has kinda gone without saying - no smoking in the new house unless it's in the basement and only once the exhaust fan is installed.  I can certainly see why  debates  between smokers and non-smokers gets so heated (pardon the pun).  Really, who's rights are more important?  The non-smoker's right to clean air and their own health?  Or the smoker's right to lead their life as they please?  I don't deny that smoking is an addictive habit and extremely hard to quit.  And I could never force my boyfriend to quit.  But at some point, I'm going to have to think about my own health.  And that of any children, should they ever come into the picture.  To be honest, I think if there was ever a baby in the picture, there would be absolutely no question - there would be no smoking anywhere near it.  And I wouldn't have to ask for it.  Well, that's it for my smoking theme today.

        I feel like the luckiest girl in the world!!      Oh my god.  Said in total valley-girl style.  What a great start to the weekend!  First, the  good-news-with-a-catch.   I'm probably going to get into trouble, but it'll be worth it.  I got away from work early today to do the bank run.  Well,  run  is an exaggeration, because there was only one bank to go to.  And it's across from the mall.  Oh, evil of evils.  So, I knew I'd be running over there to take out my weekly "allowance".  I only take it out once a week, because otherwise somehow it gets spent, and then I'm left with nothing for the last 5 days before payday. =)  I couldn't resist temptation.   I went shopping.   Just for stuff I felt I  needed , of course, and I feel I exercised very good self-restraint.  First stop, Suzy Shier, where 90% of my wardrobe is from.  What can I say?  I tend to like the trendy stuff, but not to the extreme.  I had to stop myself from buying a pair of pants and a shirt that would have been great for work.  I just got the cute sweatpants I had my eye on.  Sadly, not on sale, but I just couldn't wait any longer.  Still, they were only $30 - pretty reasonable, in my opinion.  Of course, I was at the mall, so I had to stop at Second Cup.  It's like a policy or something.  Because most Second Cup stores don't run their Chiller (coffee slush) machine in the winter, I can usually only get one when I'm at the mall.  So, happily sipping my Chiller, I made the decision to look for jeans.  I'm very picky about my jeans.  I bought a pair probably 2 years ago, and they've been my favorites ever since.  I went back about a month later, bought what was technically the exact same pair, but after one wash, they just didn't fit right.  I've since bought some trendy ones that have been seen by people maybe once each, but that original pair was my staple.  And they're finally biting the dust.  Very badly.  There's a 1 1/2-inch rip about an inch from the crotch, it's that bad.  Of course, they'll still be fine for weekends and whatnot, but I really needed a new pair.  And I actually found a pair I really liked, and that showed off my great butt :), and that shouldn't end up discarded in the "trendy" pile after one night.  Total damages this trip - about $90.  But now the great news that has no strings attached - and will hopefully overshadow my spending.  I won Monster Jam tickets for this weekend!!!!  They were having a draw for 3 sets of tickets at work, and I ended up with a set!  I won't go into the details (but suffice it to say, there was nothing random about me winning *L*) . . . but I'm still ecstatic!  I was happy enough just to have tickets, because we were going anyway, and to get the tickets free was awesome.  But the gravy is still to come - there's a parking pass for the "A" lot (closest to the building, I assume), and they're executive seats!!!  Row 1, seats 38 and 39.  I still can't believe how lucky I am!  This will be an  awesome  weekend. =)

        My cat's not skinny anymore!    I have lots of innane things to talk about today. =)  Yes, my skinny cat is looking a little beefier these days.  I noticed yesterday after I had to fill the food bowl  again .  I have one of those big feeder things, and at first, it would last for a whole week when it was only 2/3 full.  Now I'm having to refill it after only a few days.  I think if they start looking fat, we'll have to start portioning it.  But for now, they just look like healthy, well-fed cats.  Which is good.  The two cats - my bf's and mine - play-fight a lot.  Last night, they were fighting for real.  And my reaction to the situation made me wonder how on earth step-families do it.  I didn't actually see what was going on, but my bf checked up on the cats when they were a little more vocal than usual.  When I wandered around the corner, he had mine pinned down and his was around the corner.  My immediate reaction was to get defensive and think "What about your cat's part in this?".  True, mine's got claws and his doesn't, and he's probably twice her size, but she's got a mean bite and knows how to defend herself.  But I let it go.  There wasn't really any harm done.  But it struck me how instinctive it is for me to feel protective towards  my  cat.  I had the exact same problem when I lived with my dad - there it was two on two (he had two, I had two).  But whereas my bf will quickly admit he might have acted hastily, my dad always maintained that my cats were always in the wrong.  Funny, he often had the same favoritist attitude when dealing with his kids.  Personally, if I ever have kids, and they get caught fighting, I don't care who started it or who did what, they will both get punished.  But that's just me.

        I like the subject of Tim Hortons.    It's so true that it's an institution in Canada.  And the Roll Up the Rim to Win contest only makes it better.  But it's bad for me, cuz now I'm buying two coffees a day.  And I've discovered a great new drink to buy, instead of my usual morning large-double-double or medium-two-cream-one-sugar . . . french vanilla cappuccino with a touch of coffee in it.  See, on their own, Timmy's cappuccinos are awfully sweet.  But the little bit of coffee is enough to tone down the sweetness without altering the flavour.  I won a free donut on Wednesday! =)  Did you know that a doughnut (proper Canadian spelling) doesn't have any calories in it if it's free?  It's true, darn it, and if anyone tells you otherwise, they're just lying so there's more donuts for them.  It's true for cookies and muffins, too.  But you know what?  I'd much rather have a muffin than a donut.  I'll trade you,  urlLink Desiree ! =)  Or how about for your cookie,  urlLink Leah ?   Aren't I an ungrateful little brat? *L*

        Thank God It's Friday!!      This week as been so long.  I'm tired of work.  Today's been the worst, cuz it seems like I can't do anything right.  Oh well, mistakes happen - the problem is when the same mistake keeps occurring.  I've been missing a certain friend lately.  I met her at school, and for some reason, I clicked with her right away.  I don't know if she felt the same way, but we were pretty good friends as school friends go, and we hung out quite a bit.  But she moved away when she got a sweet job offer when we graduated.  I miss her lately.  I know I could call her . . . boy, I have a lot of those friends and relatives! *L*  Anyways, she's a very interesting person.  Very lively, always upbeat.  She has an awesome sense of humour.  She's assertive and accepting.  I wish we'd gotten to be better friends outside of school - maybe then we'd be in better contact now.  Maybe the motivation wasn't there because I wasn't relationship material.  It took me until the end of our first year of school to realize that she had a very wide pool of dating possibilities. =)  But it didn't bother me, cuz she was still a great person.  This entry is a tribute to her, even though she's not dead or anything. =)  She's a smart cookie, and a hard worker.  And she seemed to think I was pretty smart, too.  I liked that.  Actually, most of the few girls in my class were smart cookies.  I miss hanging out with all of them.    She knew how to party.  Boy, the stories she would come to school with on Monday morning.  Heck, even a Thursday morning! *L*    She swore that she didn't like cats, but came to love her sister's cats.  You were so funny about those cats, Donna!  And within a month of moving, you were sorely missing them.  Even though I highly doubt she knows about my blog - Donna, call me next time you're in town!  OK, there's my mission for the weekend - I'm going to call her and see how she's doing. =)

        A Night for Introspection     I was all by myself . . . nobody was loooooooooking . . . I was all by myself . . .    I'm all by my lonesome tonight, so I thought I'd take a little time to  think .  Normally, I would write in my journal.  But really, I reserve my journal for explosive and urgent emotions - neither of which I'm feeling tonight. =)  I get very intimidated when I'm faced with alone time.  Not in a bad sense, really . . . more like I'm  overwhelmed  with the possibilities.  I could work late . . . go to the gym . . . call up some friends and go for martinis . . . go visit my mum . . . go do a million and a half things I only think of doing when I'm too busy to do them.  It's hard to decide what to do with myself.  Especially when I have advance warning.    Tonight, the bf is off at a course about  ice machines , I think.  I have no idea when he's going to be back.  So I started by working late.  I've been swamped, and I figured since I'll only be going home to an empty house, I might as well try and catch up a little.  Over the course of the day, I heard numerous ads about tonight being martini night at Moxie's.  Hmmm - I could call up a few friends for an impromtu get together.  That one was tempting, but with my low alcohol tolerance, I'd be leery of driving home after just one.  Scratch that idea.  What about the gym?  Well, that idea was strong, too, until I started thinking of my very cold, ratty and not-terribly-clean gym clothes in the back of my car.  I want so badly to get a new pair of sweats, but it's an extra expense and extra spending has to be okayed by both parties. =)  Hmmm, but C's getting new work pants . . . so it should be OK.  I'm not really a huge shopping freak, but it seems like all my clothes wear out or feel old all at once, so I get the shopping bug once or twice a year, and then I spend lots of money all at once.  Gotta curb that this year, in the interest of saving for the house!  Well, all rambling aside, I'm not unhappy with how this evening has developed.  The night's still young enough that I could blog to my heart's content and still go out and get some new gym pants. =)  Hehehe - cute new pants would certainly do wonders for my motivation!  But I did begin this entry with some sort of purpose.  It's something that's been in the back of my mind lately, but I keep pushing it back there.  I'm trying to abide by the policy of "if it ain't broke . . . "  And really, nothing's broken.  It's just something I think about.  I read lots of stories and see lots of examples around me of people who "just knew" as soon as they met their significant other that this person was "the one."  I've never been a huge romantic, and I've never really put much stock in love at first sight or the concept of soulmates.  But there must be a point at which you have to stand back and say "Am I  ever  going to want to marry this person?"  I do believe, though, that it is a feeling you just get.  Like the cliche - "When you're in love, you just  know ."    Actually, that's an opinion my bf expressed very early on in our relationship.  It's kind of hard to put in clear terms . . . but as long as he can't NOT picture being with someone for a very long time, everything's OK.  But as soon as he can definitely not see them longterm, there's no point in continuing.  And I agree wholeheartedly.  The tricky part is when each party has a different picture.  It's so very true that it takes two people to make a commitment, but only one to decide that it's over.  I have such contrasting examples of marriage around me.  There's my parents . . . after 17 years, it ended in a very bitter separation and divorce.  In fact, the last 8 or so years were very cold and bitter.  I don't even know if I have memories of my parents ever being affectionate with one another.  5 years later, my father met a woman in the States, visited her twice, and proposed on the third visit.  They're still married, to my knowledge.  I don't even know if I can explain my mum's (now-ended) 5-year relationship after the divorce.  I don't see my friends' parents often enough to know how they get along.  But mine are the only divorced ones, really.  Then there's my aunt and uncle, who still seem to be in the honeymoon phase after 3 years.  And my other aunt and uncle, who are neither terribly warm nor cold, but they have weathered a lot together.  Come to think of it, I don't think any two marriages are alike.  An outsider has no way of knowing what goes on on the inside.  So really, all my introspection tonight has only served the purpose of working myself up. =)  As long as what C and I have going is working for the both of us, things are OK.  Neither of us is thinking marriage, and that works for us right now.  No matter what anybody else thinks.  When one of us starts thinking about marriage, it'll be something to talk about.  But until then, no worries.  Maybe somebody else might think it's not right if you don't know if a guy is "the one" within the first week of meeting him.  I believe it takes time to truly know someone, a lifetime even.  So there's nothing wrong with taking 2 or more years to make that decision.  Whew - OK, enough about marriage! =)   Darn, it's now past 9pm - no cute new sweats for me tonight! :(

      Received in an email today:   I had to take my son's hamster to the vet.   Here's what happened:   Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was "something wrong" with one of the two hamsters he holds prisoner in his room. "He's just lying there looking sick," he told me. "I'm serious, Dad. Can you help?"  I put my best hamster-healer statement on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little rodents was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do.  "Honey," I called, "come look at the hamster!"   "Oh, my gosh," my wife diagnosed after a minute. "She's having babies."   "What?" my son demanded. "But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!"   I was equally outraged. "Hey, how can that be? I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce," I accused my wife.   "Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?" she inquired. (I actually think she said this sarcastically!)   "No, but you were supposed to get two boys!" I reminded her, in my most loving, calm, sweet voice, while gritting my teeth together.  "Yeah, Bert and Ernie!" my son agreed.   "Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know," she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm, ya think?)   By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on.  I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. "Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience," I announced. "We're about to witness the miracle of birth."  "OH, Gross!" they shrieked.   "Well, isn't THAT just great!  What are we going to do with a litter of tiny little hamster babies?" my wife wanted to know. (I really do think she was being snotty here, too. Don't you?)   We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. "We don't appear to be making much progress," I noted "It's breech," my wife whispered, horrified.   "Do something, Dad!" my son urged.   "Okay, okay." Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a ginger tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results "Should I call 911?"  my eldest daughter wanted to know. "Maybe they could talk us through the trauma."   (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?)   "Let's get Ernie to the vet," I said grimly. We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap. "Breathe, Ernie, breathe," he urged.  "I don't think hamsters do Lamaze," his mother noted to him.   (Women can be so cruel to their own young. I mean what she does to me is one thing, but this boy is of her womb, for God's sake.)   The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass.   "What do you think, Doc, a c-section?" I suggested scientifically.   "Oh, very interesting," he murmured. "Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?"  I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside.  "Is Ernie going to be okay?" my wife asked.   "Oh, perfectly," the vet assured us. "This hamster is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen . . . Ernie is a boy."  "What!?"   "You see, Ernie is a young male. And occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um.... er.... masturbate.  Just the way he did, lying on his back."  He blushed, glancing at my wife.   "Well, you know what I'm saying, Mr. Cameron."  We were silent, absorbing this.   "So Ernie's just . . . just . . . excited?" my wife offered.   "Exactly," the vet replied, relieved that we understood.   More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle. And giggle. And then even laugh loudly.   "What's so funny?" I demanded, knowing, but not believing that the woman I married would commit the upcoming affront to my flawless manliness. Tears were now running down her face.   "It's just . . . that . . . I'm picturing you pulling on its . . . its . . . teeny little . . . " she gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more.   "That's enough," I warned.   We thanked the veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and our son back into the car.   He was glad everything was going to be okay.   "I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad," he told me.   "Oh, you have NO idea," my wife agreed, collapsing into laughter.

      The expert level of Minesweeper is taunting me.  "You'll never beat me, Ang."  I'm going to beat it.  Then I think I'm going to pull out my school notes and redo some homework assignments.  This boredom is nuts.

      Found this cool thing at a new blog today -  urlLink a free name report , and I found it at  urlLink this girl's blog.   This name report has me pretty well pegged:   The name of Angela creates a very quiet, practical nature and a clever and inventive mind. Being analytical and naturally studious, you are interested in a factual understanding of the mysteries of life. Your methodical nature requires that you like to finish what you start without interruptions and also to have everything in its place and properly organized. An ability to concentrate could take you into computer programming or accountancy or any work requiring concentration and attention to detail. You have, also, a flair for creative expression with your hands. You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing much turmoil and unhappiness. Finding it difficult to join in conversation with those with whom you are not well-acquainted, you could feel quite alone and uncommunicative with new acquaintances or in a large crowd. As a result, you could be accused of being unfriendly. You desire so much to be understood, but your name has limited your verbal expression to such an extent that it is very difficult for you to divulge your innermost thoughts even to those closest to you. One of your greatest salvations is being out in nature, for it is there that you find the peace and serenity you so much desire. Physically you could suffer through tension in the heart, lungs, or bronchial organs, and also through intestinal problems, constipation, etc.   I won't comment on the health problems thing, except to say that they got the constipation part wrong. =)  But everything else is pretty bang on.  Very interesting.

        The Day Quickly Approaches . . .     We got a phone call last night from the home builder -   "We're ready to do your framing walk-through.  When can you come by on Wednesday between 8am and 3pm?"  Well, actually he initially said Tuesday (today) but then called back and said he meant Wednesday.  Which was OK, because today wouldn't have worked.  At least tomorrow we knew we'd have to work something out so I had the car anyways.  So we'll go tonight by ourselves (so the bf can give me things to point out that I might otherwise miss), and tomorrow I'll go by myself (since he'll be in school between 8 and 3).  And we'll get a possession date.  Holy cow.  How on earth did I figure 3 to 3 1/2 months from the beginning of April was the end of July??  It's the   beginning   of July!  I have very bad calendar math . . .   Unless I've been misinformed (or misheard), we'll be in the house in 45 to 60 days.  Guess we'll find out for sure tomorrow.  We've been walking through it every couple of days in the last couple of weeks.  The framing is up, and now it's been shingled and the electrical has been done.  We have snow drifts at the back door, because neither door has a handle/lock on it, the basement is still dirt, and there are still a few gaps in the roof/ceiling, so some of the floors are wet.  It boggles my mind that everything else could get done in two months, so perhaps I'm wrong.  But it's exciting to see things develop.  I know I keep promising this, but pictures are coming.  I think I'm 5 away from finishing the roll, and I'm sure we'll take more tonight.    And for anyone who might care -  urlLink my bank (TD Canada Trust)  has a mortgage giveaway contest going - up to $100,000 is the grand prize.  15 secondary prizes of $5000.  Anyone getting a new mortgage or renewing is eligible - and you can send in "no purchase" entries.  So who knows?  Somebody's got to win it, right? =)  Exciting stuff . . .

        Puppy Porn!!  Ack!!    I felt a need to share this, just because I am so traumatized.  It is definitely time to book Rascal's surgery soon.  My bf and I were just hanging around in the living room, with Rascal playing on the floor.  It's become second nature to keep at least one eye on him at all times.  He had been racing around and playing for a little while, and suddenly got quiet, so of course we both looked down at him.  He was sitting there quite contently with his little puppy penis in his mouth - and it was growing!!!  I couldn't breathe for nearly a minute, I was just hysterical.  I was laughing so hard and yet traumatized all at once. *L*  According to Heaven Can Wait, he's still pretty young to be snipped - 3 1/2 months.  Most vets prefer to wait until 4 months, but when I called and told the tech the situation, she said that he sounds like he should be booked in soon.  No humping and spraying as of yet, but I'm sure it's not far away.  I don't want to have to change his name to "Horny Little Bastard" . . .   The bf's reaction, after he calmed down?  "I'd be doing that too if I could!"  *LMAO*

      I'm feeling  veerrrrrrryyyyyyyy  lazy today.    And I've got a headache and blurry eyes from staring at the computer and playing Minesweeper and Solitaire and Pinball all morning while the internet was down.    You'd think I'd get in trouble for it, but I have to be here and I've done all there is to do.  I'll go read some more blogs . . . =)

       More Inane Monday Morning Brain Farts . . .    Cold pizza doesn't have anywhere near as many calories as piping hot pizza.  Swear!  Cuz it's not greasy anymore, see? =)  And don't try to tell me otherwise, cuz that's today's lunch.  I'm such a little stress puppy.  Really, I am.  Stuff always works itself out, regardless of what I do.  I have the best mom in the world.  I'd updated her on my car woes earlier in the week, and Friday evening I got a phone call.   "Can you come over tonight?" in a rather urgent tone.  "I have some stuff I'd like you to look over.  Is the car shop open tomorrow?" (She'd just been to court the previous day over yet more child support issues). "Yeah, it's open til noon on Saturdays.  How come?" "How much was the bill again?" "$704-something.  How come?" "Well, your dad actually paid me this month so I have a little extra money.  I can write you a cheque and we'll go down and get it tomorrow." There was a stunned moment or two of silence.  I protested somewhat, arguing that I didn't want to owe her for a car that was long gone. "I didn't say anything about lending you the money." This was just too much.  I didn't know what to say except "Are you really sure about this?" "Yes.  I don't want you to do something you'll end up regretting or getting in trouble for, and you really don't need this stress in your life right now."  I really love my mum!  Now I'm even more motivated to take the shop to small claims court so that I can pay her back and then she can take herself on a shopping spree! =)  I was worrying over nothing when it came to Rascal.  For one, I ended up calling the vet later that day, and found out that kennel cough has absolutely nothing to do with how long he's in his kennel.  Phew.  And he seems fine now, health-wise.  I'm sure it had more to do with the fact that anything and everything goes in his mouth, and perhaps he'd been chewing on a clump of cat fur just before bed that night.    And he's getting better at not whining as much when he has to go in his kennel when we go out.  So he doesn't really need to come into work with me.  I think it would be more stress for me than anything.  Not that I really have much work he'd be distracting me from, but we'd probably both get stressed out - me trying to keep him quiet in my office, and him wanting to go out and explore this new place.  We finalized the adoption over the weekend.  The people who run this foundation really are great.  It was funny because the lady filled out the papers "C____ and Angela O_______".  We seem to get that a lot lately - people assuming we're married.  Maybe we act like it? *L*  I can't believe it's only 2:30.  I wanna go pick up my car, and get to tell Mr. Asshole that this is far from over.  Not that he'll care or take me seriously, but it'll make me feel better.  And then I'll find out how to start a small claim.  I hate being stuck at work.  My bf needed my car this morning, because he waited until yesterday to attempt to start up his.  It's been sitting in the back parking pad for about 6 months, and wasn't in the best of health then, either.  After numerous boosts and leaving it running, it was obvious it didn't want to stay running.  And he had to get to and from school today.  And seeing as he graciously chauffeured me around (and would have lent me his car, had I been able to drive a standard) when I was having vehicular problems, I don't mind at all.  I don't think twice about helping him out when he needs it, and he does the same for me. =)  Even so, I still don't like knowing I'm stuck at work.  If I'd thought ahead, I would have worn my runners instead of my office shoes, and walking wouldn't be a big deal.  I'm hoping it warms up again soon, so I can ride his bike to work and still be somewhat mobile.  Freaky weather this weekend!  We woke up to a very dark and eerily quiet house Saturday morning, because the power was out and it was completely white outside!  Having nothing to do and not being able to make much of a breakfast, we ventured out in the car.  That was fun!  No accidents, as the bf is an excellent driver (even though he sometimes scares me, I know he knows what he's doing), just one long adventure. =)  Power was out in much of the neighbourhood, and many places were closed simply because nobody could make it in to open shop.  Well, enough ramblings for now.

       So Much More Than I Thought   The more I read and the longer we're with Rascal, the more I realize how involved raising a puppy can be.  Don't get me wrong - I'm not about to quit or say I'm in over my head at this point.  We're finalizing the adoption tonight, and I don't intend to let this puppy down.  But I do, however, need to learn some patience, and remind myself of something very fundamental:  Dogs are eager to please, and never do anything out of malice.  I - and the bf, for that matter, cuz we're a team in this - need to learn to read his actions and how to teach him things appropriately.  I've discovered quite a bit this morning, and something needs to be done soon.  The puppy had me scared two nights ago, because he was hacking periodically and his breathing seemed somewhat laboured.  The bf assured me he would be fine, but I still did not sleep easily or heavily that night.  This morning, he was sounded rather stuffy, like he had a cold.  When I brought this up at work this morning, Sue - my source of infinite wisdom - said that he almost positively had the start of kennel cough.  I had heard this term before, but didn't know what it was or how it was caused.  I'm told it's like asthma to a dog, and it comes from being in a confined space for too long.  This makes sense - when we're at work, Rascal is in his kennel, and when we sleep, he's in his kennel.  So he's only out for 5-6 hours a day.  More on weekends, but still.  I feel horrible.  So I think I'm going to suggest that we train him to sleep on a blanket or dog bed in the bedroom, instead of inside the kennel.  The second thing I learned is that we are definitely not doing the crate-training thing properly.  He definitely does not like going into his kennel, and does not go willingly.  I was of the opinion that, if we kept putting him in there, he would learn to like it.  Well, that's pretty illogical thinking.  It wouldn't work with humans: forcing someone to do something they didn't like would definitely not  make  them like it eventually.  I learned that you need to gradually get them used to crawling in on their own, and associate the kennel with good things, like food and treats.  So we need to start fresh with the crate training.  And third, poor Rascal definitely has separation anxiety.  I don't really know if it's mild or severe, but I think it's probably somewhere in between.  We need to get him accustomed to seeing us leave for short periods of time, and teach him that we ARE coming back, and that he doesn't need to get anxious everytime we go to leave.  And this is likely to take quite a while.  Again, more patience on our part.  So I'm going to try and talk to my boss today about bringing Rascal in to work with me while we work on this issue.  Presuming he doesn't become a big disturbance, of course.  He's reasonably well-behaved, especially considering he's a puppy, so I'm hoping it wouldn't take long for him to be calm in this new environment.  We'll see if it works . . . I just spoke to my boss and he said he'd get back to me this afternoon on it.  His biggest concern - because he's allowed it in the past - is soiled carpets.  So I assured him that Rascal's become quite good at letting me know when he needs to go, and I'd look after any accidents.  So we'll see if he'll allow it.  I'm hoping it'll help.  So many changes coming for the poor pup - especially with us moving in a few months.  Well, things should stabilize after that, because I can't foresee any more big changes after we move.

       A Magic Crystal Ball   On one of my numerous blog-stalking excursions I came across this novel suggestion - what if someone could show you your future?  Would you want to see it?  This got me to thinking - say there was a video floating around out there called "Ang's Life", and it was a complete video, would I want to see that parts I haven't already seen?  There are some very good reasons for wanting too . . . avoiding bad decisions, catastrophic events, and the like.  Basically you would know in advance where all the bad parts are and you could fix them.  But I would have to say that I'd decline.  Where's the fun in living when you already know the outcome?  What makes life so unique and interesting is not knowing what's going to happen, and part of the fun is thinking that anything  can  happen.  Good or bad.  You always hope it's good, but the key ingredient is not knowing.  Would you want to see your future if you could?

      I really am a coward.  I would love nothing more than to hide in some dark hole and get someone else to fix my problems for me.  But I'm supposed to be a big girl, one who can fix her own problems.  Even at almost 24, sometimes I really wish I could still go home crying and have someone say that everything will be OK.  To 'not worry, I'll take care of it."  But I haven't done that in years, and don't intend to start.  *sigh* Yes, more on the car.  I've made so many phone calls today.  I really wanted to get it dealt with.  But I called the police one more time, just to double check that I wasn't going to show up and suddenly have the tables turned on me.  I'm glad I called ahead of time.  It was a different officer/detective (I'm clueless when it comes to titles), and this one told me that it was a civil matter and the police don't get involved.    Since I had pretty much planned out how the afternoon would go, it took me a few teary-eyed moments to compose myself.  I figured, "Fine - if they won't help me, then it would make sense that they wouldn't help him, either."  So I resolved to make definite plans with the guys from work to "repossess" my car.  They were more than happy to help me out, but wanted to be sure it wasn't illegal or anything.  So just to be on the safe side, I called the police one more time.  Don't worry - they booted me off for an emergency call, so don't fret that our boys in blue were tied up with my petty problems. =)  I asked if a car shop manager could report a car stolen, or if it had to go through the owner.  She hesitated and said, "Well, we prefer to deal with the owner.  Why?  Are you calling from a car shop?"  Me, not having thought this through, said that, "No, I'd be the owner."  Obviously she was a little confused and asked what the situation was.  I told her - the shop did repairs I didn't authorize, I wanted my car back but they wouldn't release it until I paid them.  I said, "It's a civil matter, isn't it?  I can't be charged with taking back my own car, can I?"  Well, ladies and gentlemen, yes I can.  If there are new parts, that's theft.  The labour is up for dispute, and he'd have to sue me for that.  But if there were any new parts put in the car, I could be charged with theft.  That scared me shitless.  The last thing I wanted was to be charged when I'm the one getting screwed!  So I've spent the better part of the afternoon (at home - I took the afternoon off) mulling over what the hell I could do without breaking any laws.  Trying to think of every possible angle to every situation.  In the end, I decided I definitely needed some legal advice.  Most lawyers offer a free initial consultation, so maybe they could tell me what my options are.  I'm waiting to hear back about making an appointment.  So now I need to try and sort this all out into clear "problem and solution" terms so that I don't waste the lawyer's time.  And I think to make things less complicated, I'm going to have to ignore the fact that I'm trying to sell it.  Let's see if I can put it in clear and simple terms:  Problem :  I feel that the repair shop in question wrongly charged me for repairs that were very likely due to work they did previously on the vehicle.   Ideal Solution :  The vehicle is released to me with no further charges to me, I get a second opinion (at their expense) that it is in adequate running condition, and I get reimbursed for the unfair charges I've already paid.   Compromised Solution :  I get my car back at no further expense to me, and the second opinion at their expense.  I guess we'll see what happens.  I promise I'll try and blog about something different next time. =)

       Anybody Have a Butterfly Net?    I don't know if it's the coffee (first one this morning in over a week) or nerves, but the butterflies have been set loose in my tummy.  And I've got a nasty case of the shakes.  I might need a harness soon to keep me in my seat.  I think it might be both.  I've made up my mind to take care of the nasty business that is my car today.  I've still gotta ask my boss if he'd mind if I took the afternoon off, but seeing as there's absolutely nothing to do, I don't think he'd object.  My boss is really good that way. =)  I know you don't read this, but Joe, please don't take this personally.  It never had anything to do with the quality of your work.  It always had to do with my dealings with your shop manager.  Please still be friends with me and the bf when this is all over.  We like you (and your wife, obviously *s*) lots, and we'd be very sad if you decided you didn't like us because of a silly car.

        All is right with the world again . . .     Well, right enough at least.  There's just no denying that I'm not a morning person.  I just can't deal with stuff first thing in the morning.  It's now 2:41pm, and everything is OK again.  My blog actually does seem to be replacing my journal.  Often, when things aren't right, all I need to do is vent about it.  Then suddenly things don't seem as bad.  The only exception being the car, since it's a physical problem I'm actually going to have to deal with.  Unfortunately, I'm really tired of drama lately, and don't feel up to creating more by trying to repossess this car.  But I know I need to.  But it just requires so much energy.  Anyways, I'm going to leave that thought alone, because my day is going alright now.  No need to spoil it.  It's over 18C outside, and I think we've had our week of spring.  Summer's here. *L*  That seems to be how weather works here in Calgary:  We get 4-5 months of reasonably mild winter, followed by a week of spring, 6-7 months of summer, followed by a week or so of autumn.  It won't be long until our weather is strikingly similar to Vancouver's.  I brought Rascal by work on my lunch break.  It's a good thing that the atmosphere is reasonably lax around here . . . I've started taking 1.5 hour lunches simply because there's really no reason to be rushing back to the office.  There's absolutely no work at the moment, and I'm terrible when it comes to amusing myself in a productive manner.  So I brought the puppy by.  Sue really wanted to meet him.  It was my first time dealing with him on my own, and I think I did fairly well.  He was almost bouncing off the walls by the time I got home, and when I let him out, I was very pleased to see him pee twice and even poop.  I'm sure you all love reading about my dogs digestive activities! =)  Since he was still bouncing all over the place, I attempted to take him for a walk.  Attempted being the key word.  Despite my best efforts to look like I was walking a dog, he was walking me.  That's OK - the exercise definitely wouldn't hurt me.  He definitely needs to go to the off-leash park before dinner.  Or maybe after - we should tire him out as late as possible.    Man, if I was single - or my bf was single, for that matter - neither of us would have any trouble picking up dates!  Not that I tend that way, but as I was walking Rascal at lunch, a girl drove by, then stopped and backed up.  She rolled down her window, and asked "How old?"  I was a little taken aback - I'm not used to complete strangers stopping to talk, especially from their cars!  So I chatted with her a few minutes.  She said he was really cute, and she had a 4-mo-old Rottie at home, just down the street, and maybe they'd meet in the park sometime?    Really, people - if it had been a guy in that car, it totally could have been a pick-up.  So I'll have to make sure I'm always with the bf when he goes out with Rascal . . . ;)  Naw, I'm not really the jealous type of girlfriend (99% of the time, anyways).    So all in all, it's not such a bad day after all.  I forgot to pick up my gym clothes, so I guess I won't be going to the gym after work, but that's OK with me.  I'm sure we'll go for another walk with Rascal tonight, and maybe go see the house again, and it's all good.  And all the sun reminds me that I should start looking into tanning again . . . I burn so easily, I need a slight tan from faking and baking just so that I'm not as prone to it when I'm out in the sun.  I'm not really all that concerned with the tan itself - I just really don't like burning all the time.  Because really, when you're out having fun, sometimes it's hard to stop every hour or so to refresh the sunscreen.  Over and out for now!

       I'm Going to Make a Horrible Mom Someday . . .     I couldn't wait to leave the house this morning.  And it's just a puppy.  I knew there was a good reason why I always said I didn't want kids.  It hasn't been a good Monday so far.  And it's only just after 8am. *sigh*  The weekend wasn't going so bad by Sunday evening.  I think Rascal was getting used to us and we were getting used to him (and his habits).  We kept him busy on Sunday, with a big long walk around noon, and then taking him over to Easter dinner at the bf's mom's house.  She's got three dogs of her own (all smaller than my cats).  He'd met them the day before, so we knew there wouldn't be any real problems.  He was a good boy for the most part.  By the time we got home after dinner, he was pooped (in the figurative sense).  He fell fast asleep by 7pm.  Unfortunately, this meant that by the time we went to bed at 10:30, he decided he was awake and wanted to play.  He whined and scratched at his kennel door for a good 10 minutes before we wondered if maybe he needed to go outside one more time.  BF came back in very unimpressed - it became apparent that he didn't need to go, he just didn't want to go to bed.  So we left him to whine himself to sleep.  Then, this morning, we didn't think ahead.  Our usual habit on weekdays is to set the alarm clock a good 1/2 hour before we really intend to get up.  Then we gradually wake after each 'snooze'.  Obviously the puppy was not going to follow our lead.  So, since the bf had taken him out last, I offered to take him out this morning.  I already wasn't too impressed at being up 40 mins before I needed to be.  I'm  not  a morning person.  He raced up the stairs, but when I didn't go out with him, he was hesitant.  I was in my pjs and shivering, so now there was strike 2 at having to go out on the deck and wait for him to pee.  I should have waited longer.  But as usual, as soon as he pees, he comes bouncing back to whoever is out with him.  So we went back in and I fed him.  I'd shut the bedroom door so the bf could get a couple extra minutes in bed.  Well, Rascal was extremely restless after eating only a small portion of his food.  I thought maybe he was just anxious because the bedroom door was shut, or maybe he wanted to play, but when he disappeared into the computer room (he's only pooped in the bedroom and the computer room, both of which have shag-like carpets) and I could see him in a squatting position, I was devastated.  Strike 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 . . . . . not a good start to a Monday morning.  So I shooed him outside mid-poop and felt like crying.  I swear, it will take weeks after he's finally fully house-trained before I get the smell of puppy poop out of my nose.  That is nasty stuff . . . if you've ever smelled the runny green stuff in baby diapers, you can relate!  So I cleaned it up, brought him inside and he went straight into his kennel.  At this point, the bf and I agree - we really don't care what any articles say about negative reactions.  He goes in his kennel after something like that . . . it's almost for our benefit more than his, so we can cool down and then deal with the situation properly, rather than improperly because we're angry and frustrated.  Even after he finally did his business outside when I let him out one last time, I just couldn't not muster even a half-hearted "good boy", because I tried to get him to sniff it and he just wasn't listening.  I was very glad to leave for work.  I just know I would make a horrible mom.  I'm too impatient, and I get angry and frustrated far too easily.  I'm hoping by lunchtime I've cooled off considerably.  It's my job to take him out at lunch to do his business, and preferably for a walk as well.  I was also thinking of bringing him by the office for a short visit, but I won't let him in the car before he's done his business, and sometimes that takes a while.  On the plus side, we got a few tips from the bf's mom (I really like her *s*).  She said that sometimes you can encourage them to go by massaging the little indent between their belly and their back hips.  This seemed to work this morning (after the accident) and once last night.  So I think we'll keep it up when we take him outside.  She said it's what their mothers do to get them to go.  So far, I've strongly discouraged the bf from doing things the old-fashioned way - rubbing the dog's nose in the mess.  I'd heard/read from numerous sources that this is ineffective and can confuse the dog into associating the negative reaction with pooping in general.  At this point, though, I'm willing to try anything.  So long as he's not rough with the dog, and still shows him where he  IS  supposed to go, we'll see if we have better luck with that.  I kind of liken it to a spanking . . . so long as it's done properly, perhaps it's what's needed.  Wow, I can sure talk up a storm about puppy business . . . but it feels a lot better to have vented!

       Puppy Update    Well, what would the weekend be without an update on the puppy? =)  First off, let me say that no amount of warning from people or reading material can quite prepare you for how much of a lifestyle change a puppy  really  is.  If this is even 1/10 of what it's like to have a baby/kids, I've definitely got some more years of preparation ahead of me!  When we first picked him up, immediately we noticed how much he'd grown!  Despite being told that his mom was small (about 30lbs), it's obvious there must have been a large papa involved.  He's at least 1 or 2 inches taller this week.  So we listened to his habits and any advice his foster mom gave us, and had our first decision to make.  Should we put him in his kennel for the ride home, or see how he fares when he's left on his own?  He started off in the kennel, but whined horribly.  So a few blocks later, he was let out.  Well, we quickly discovered that it would be much better for all parties if he stayed in his kennel, at least for this ride.  We got home, and figured it might be best if he could roam freely and get a feel for the place without introducing the cats.  When we finally did let the cats out, it was surprisingly quiet.  Stupid was definitely not amused, and made that known.  But Tigger was simply curious, not hissing or getting defensive.  And Rascal gave them their room - he's obviously learned already that cats aren't creatures you want to aggravate. =)  The house training is not going quite so well.  After one or two peeing accidents, we've figured out just how much and often puppies pee.  So in anticipation, we simply make a conscious effort to take him outside once an hour, and especially just after he's woken up or had a big drink of water.  Unfortunately, the pooping is a different story.  Anyone with experience and wise words would be most definitely appreciated.  He's only pooped twice in the 24 hours we've had him, but both times have been in the bedroom (despite our frequent trips outside and avid attention to any excessive whining).  We cleaned and "Febrezed" the area the first time, and his kennel is right there, too, so we're not quite sure how to effectively correct this.  One idea we've had if it happens again is to put the mess outside and have him sniff it there.  I guess we'll see if it works.  So much to learn.  So many more stories to come, I'm sure.  And probably a few disagreements over how to train for desired behaviour and discourage the bad.  It's all a learning experience, huh? =)

       Release the Inner Bitch    It's time to get dirty.  I'm at my wits end, I've had enough.  This girl is going to get medieval on one asshole shop manager.  I need to do a little more thinking and talking with the bf (and maybe a lawyer), but my path is heading towards small claims court.  I happened to be driving by the car shop last night, and casually glanced over.  There were absolutely no cars parked where my car used to be.  I thought I saw it peeking out from behind a pump.  Weird.  I decided to swing by again later and see what was up.  When I drove by later, I found it on the opposite side of the lot, wedged behind the propane pumps with a car parked at 90 degrees behind it so that it was boxed in.  He's treating my car like it belongs to him and he thinks I'm going to steal it.  It's not theft if it belongs to you, and that car still belongs to me.  Problem is, if I try and take it off the lot by whatever means, he can turn around and put a lien on it, and then it's impossible to sell.  If I can't sell it, he's not getting paid.  But I doubt he'll think of it that way.  I can't even call the shop anymore because I know I would just start screaming at him.  And that definitely wouldn't be in my favour if I end up suing him.  I want to know if my case would even stand a remote chance in court.  I would think it would, but I'm hardly an expert on such issues.  *L*  I should take time off work and stand outside the shop screaming.  Warn anybody coming in with a vehicle that he'll screw them out of their money.  Scare off all his customers so he starts losing business.  I'm so sick with rage.  I want this to end.  I really want to inflict serious pain on this man who's caused me so much anxiety over the last 6 months.  And I rarely get mad enough to want to inflict physical pain on people.  I need to go home for lunch before I yell at an innocent bystander here.

      We'll see if this works . . . below should be a picture of my (potential) puppy . . .   Yay, yay, yay!  It works!  Thanks to Le, although I had to tweak your instructions somewhat. Ain't he just adorable?  His personality definitely warrants "Rascal" . . . we'll see if it sticks.

        Soooooo bored    I hate days like this.  Time is crawling by . . . there's much on my mind . . . and I can't seem to occupy it.  I can't motivate myself to undertake the mundane tasks that  could  keep me busy . . .   I'm waiting to hear from Leah about somewhere to host pics so I can post them here.  If someone else stumbles by and wants to drop any helpful hints, feel free.  There's a picture of my puppy on the foundations website, so I figured I'd see if I could post it here for something different.  Meh . . . Friday isn't coming soon enough.

        2 more sleeps!      Yes, I still mark the passage of time in terms of sleeps.  Well, when it's short-term, anyways. =)  Amid all this excitement in my own life, there seems to be much turmoil outside of my little bubble.  Marriages dissolving, people committing suicide . . . the bf got a call last night from his bro saying he should probably call his mom.  Turns out her boss went home and committed suicide out of the blue the day before.  No one can figure out why.  My little sheltered self has been exposed to more death and human misery in the last 2 years, it seems, than my entire life up to that point.  Sometimes I really wish I was able to share some of the happiness in my own life these days with people who could use some.  But then again, I guess life just isn't complete without the ups  and  the downs.  I'm sure my turn will come some day when things aren't so peachy, and hopefully I can draw on the good times to get me through it.  I hope all those out there who are experiencing tough times have some good ones to keep in mind to get them through it.

        A Rant About Animal Treatment      OK, I have this topic on my mind.  I have personally boycotted Petland for this reason, but we stopped off at one on Saturday anyways.  They've recently incorporated an adoption program in addition to their usual animals for sale.  To be honest, the adoptive animals seem to have much better living conditions than the ones you pay big money for.  I just don't think it's right.  Have you ever seen the little cells these puppies and kittens live in?  They're about 3' x 3' x 4', and I may be overestimating.  The floors are wire so the animal just voids itself wherever, whenever, and they can slide out the tray below and clean it.  Logical and efficient, sure, but hardly humane in my opinion.  I saw large-breed puppies that occupied nearly 1/3 of their living space.  One particular puppy caught our attention - a Husky/Malamute cross.  We inquired about her, only to find that they wanted $688 (for a mixed breed??), and this was considered a discount because she'd already been returned once, and diagnosed by a vet as a possible fear biter.  They wanted $700 for an animal that needed extra attention and special training?  I would have been more than willing to consider a "special needs" puppy, but not if you want me to pay you $700, and then cough up more to have it fixed.  The poor thing is almost guaranteed to become a fear biter, and will probably end up at one of the rescue foundations.  It makes me sick.  We didn't stay there long, obviously.  There should be laws against places like that.

        Brain Farts for a Monday      This is one thing I've never been able to get used to in my industry . . . the busy/dead cycle.  When it's on, there's just no stopping.  Being 3-4 weeks behind is usual.  At least in most jobs I've had.  And when it's off, everything just stops dead in its tracks.  In Jan/Feb, I was constantly 3-4 weeks behind, and it bothered me to no end.  March saw me catching up reasonably, and work was still steady.  Now, halfway through April, things have ground to a halt.  I'm caught up, just waiting for some last little bits of data to trickle in so I can officially empty my "ongoing" folder.  So my thoughts to turn mundane but potentially crucial tasks.  Although it's entirely possible that nothing will happen, I decided it would probably be immensely useful if I outlined my job description.  It was felt that, when my predecessor went on mat leave, 5 weeks was almost not long enough to train someone new.  They were a little panicked 6 weeks in advance.  To be perfectly honest, the first week was valuable, but beyond that, I learned all I needed to know in the weeks just after she left.  It's not a complicated job, but there are lots of little things that can make the difference between a satisfied customer who will return and one who is disappointed but never says anything and doesn't return.    And there's always lots of little organizational things I can do that will make my (or someone else's) life easier when things do pick up.  But I sure hate the slow times, because my mind goes idle and it becomes far to easy to waste time because there doesn't seem to be anything  productive  to do.  So, what on earth could my idle mind be mulling today?  Perhaps the house?  Perhaps the previously-mentioned post about a puppy?  Perhaps the possibility of new employment opportunities?  Or perhaps all of the above and many other mundane things?  Yup, all of the above.  The house comes along quickly . . . I worry on a daily basis if we'll have the amount required by the possession date.  I will worry until it's paid.  It's just my nature.  I joked to the bf the other day that I could win the lottery and I'd still worry about money.  Don't really know who I learned that habit from, but oh well.  The puppy.  THE PUPPY! =)  I shall elaborate on this one, since it's mostly all I think about (consciously, anyways).    Same as the last few weekends, Saturday afternoon is the designated "dog window-shopping day".  We browse the pet stores, particularly Petsmart between 1-3 and the Humane Society.  We're looking to adopt a puppy rather than buying.  I still cringe when I walk into Petland, but that's another story for another post.  We've become quite familiar with the local rescue foundations, the biggest of which being  urlLink ARF  and  urlLink Heaven Can Wait .  ARF updates their website almost daily, and is based out of Calgary.  They bring a couple of dogs every week to Petsmart on Saturdays to advertise.  Their dogs are placed with "foster" homes until they're adopted which, while I think is better than being in rows of cages a la Humane Society, has it's drawbacks.  Heaven Can Wait is very similar, and is based out of High River.  (If you want an idea of what our potential puppy looks like, he's one of "Eden's pups" on the website).  The latter just happened to be at Petsmart this weekend.  While we hadn't been greeted with the warmest enthusiasm by the ARF reps in the past, the HCW people were more than helpful and willing to talk to us.  We initially expressed interest in a Husky/Sheppard older pup (5 mos), since she was the breed/mix we'd had in mind.  The rep gave us great detail, and asked us questions to help identify what kind of animal might suit us best.  Unfortunately, due to early malnutrition, this particular dog was delicate and would never live up to the reputation of either breed (Husky or Shep).  I just couldn't see my bf being happy with indoor dog that would never be able to run.  We needed an active one.  The lady advised us that there would be puppies arriving shortly, and perhaps they would suit us better.  So we left, thought about it, and returned a short while later.  True to her word, there were three Heinz-57 pups toussling with each other when we returned.  One had been claimed earlier by a family, and one had potential bone issues, so she offered to let us take the third one for a short walk around the store.  That's all it took . . . we were both smitten.  Being the wise lady she was, she told us to go home and think about it, and she didn't want to hear from us until at least the next day.  We'd be first in line, and no one else could adopt him until we called her back.  She explained that if we still wanted to look into adopting him, they would give us a 4-day "trial", and they'd supply everything.  If we still wanted him after the four days, then we paid the nominal fee (for surgery, etc) and adopted him.  We called her back the next day, and the bf said she sounded really excited to hear from us.  We were excited ourselves. *L*  We go to pick him up from High River (I love little excursions outside the city) on Friday evening.  We spent Sunday doing an extra-good job of cleaning . . . suddenly it seemed like I got "parent eyes" - seeing all the possible choking hazards, and things that could get knocked over by an excited puppy tail (he's got the skinny, whipping Lab tail), and just re-organizing things so there was more play room.  There's still a few other little things, like clearing out a space for the kennel in the bedroom, and getting something to cover the backseat of my car.  Holy, am I excited.  I've never had a dog before.  I spent last night browsing for articles on raising a puppy.  I think the cats can tell something is up.  I hope they all get along.  There will definitely be some adjusting, but apparently the puppy has already been exposed to cats, it's just a matter of our cats adjusting to him. =)  Sheesh - it never rains but pours, huh?  My life can be mind-numbingly dull for months, and then everything happens at once.  OK, so there hasn't really been a dull moment for the last couple of years.  Will I be able to deal with it when things settle down?

       I am suffering from a serious lack of enthusiasm considering it's Friday.  Serious lack of creativity, too.  Maybe I'll take a crack at Biskette's taxes so I can get rid of any logical tendencies from my brain.  She's got foreign income this year, so I jumped all over that.  I think she thinks that I have a screw loose somewhere, or that I'm just teasing her when I excitedly offer to do her taxes.  I dunno, I'm just weird that way.  I love the satisfaction I get from making numbers line up  just so , and having it all mean something.  I hope her sister hasn't done hers yet, either. =)  She didn't want them done on the computer, which is more than fine by me, I just have to get in touch with Biskette again to let her know I'm all for it.  Enh, a girl's gotta get her kicks from somewhere, n'est pas?

        Dilemmas and Excitement      Well, let's start with the excitement, shall we?  We took another drive by the house last night, since progress is so rapid these days.  They had the first floor walls up, and they were just about to put up the second floor.  Went in to the office to sign a sheet acknowledging that the city now knew where all the utilities were going to be (luckily not in our backyard!) . . . sheesh, there's a sheet to sign for everything!    Anyways, we got chatting with the sales rep and he was telling us that things were really moving along on our house.  Another 3-4 weeks max and they'd be ready for the framing walk-through, at which point they give us a possession date.  And the possession date is often 45-60 days in advance.  Holy cow!  I couldn't believe this was all actually happening.  We'd resigned ourselves to a late-Aug/early-Sept possession, and now it's looking like late July.  When I say "July", it sounds far away, but put into terms of months - 3 to 3 1/2 - it's soooo close!  OK *deep breath*  I will try and calm down now.  After that, we went and visited with a guy my bf knows from work and his wife.  They live just around the corner from our house, which only made me more excited.  They're cool people, and they'll be just around the corner!  We'll have neighbours we like! *L*  On to the dilemma part.  Things have slowed down considerably at work, and while I still have a few things to catch up on, I'm not in any huge hurry these days.  And so I'm browsing the net a little more.  I have a habit of passively checking job postings at other oil & gas companies when I'm bored.  And horror of all horrors, I come across what seems like the perfect job - the one I was hunting for when I got laid off last summer.    Go for it, you say?  I would absolutely love to.  But here comes the dilemma part.  The company is one we've worked for in the not-so-distant past.  And with the house possession coming up, I'm not sure how switching jobs will affect our mortgage status.  In the last few years, the almost 9 months I've been at this job has been my longest stint at any one job.  I really wanted to be able to stay at one job for a while, but I knew within a few months of starting here that I was going to be itching for more very quickly.  Every job has it's ups and downs, it's pros and cons, and this one is no exception.  I don't delude myself that another job would be any different, but advancement and learning opportunities are very high on my list of important things for job satisfaction.  This one ranks very low on those points.  Well, I have until May 3 to make up my mind.  This might be a good thing to discuss with the bf, as it would have an impact on him, too.  Oh - and did I mention there'd be a salary increase, too? =)  Oh my, just too much on my mind today!  Guess the best thing to do is distract myself with work until it's time to go home!

         Some Well-Wishing       It seems that someone I consider an internet friend is going through some rough times.   urlLink "kelly" , whose blog I've been visiting for a few months now, hasn't been having a very good time lately.  She hasn't posted in a couple of weeks, and though I'm reluctant to put much credence in a comment left by a random (to me) person, it's obvious she could use with some well-wishing.  So, for those that are religious - I'm sure she could use with your prayers.  For the rest of us who aren't into that (ever or anymore) - send your best wishes on your strongest telepathic lines!    Kelly, I wish I could offer you more than just words, but whatever you're going through, I hope you have lots of loving and supportive people around you to help out!

       Oh - and another thing that sucks about being sick.  I'm missing a friend's birthday party bash.  At Yuk-Yuks.  That makes me very sad.  But I bucked up enough to take the short drive past the house.  I could be on my death bed, and I'd still crawl into the car to go see the house! =)  Especially now . . . on the weekend, we noticed piles and piles of lumber with our job number on it . . . today, half the framing was up!  The bf chatted briefly with the crew (I stayed in the car), and they expect it'll be all up by tomorrow.  Holy jeepers!  Less than 3 days to frame an entire house!  Well, here's a toast to the birthday girl, even though I couldn't make it -       Happy Birthday, Shari!

        I Hate Being Sick      I'm such a baby when I'm not feeling good.  Thank goodness I have a boyfriend who's totally sweet when I'm sick. =)  Ohhh, ohhhh, maybe it's SARS?!!  Sheesh, those people drive me up the wall.  There's been how many? - 8? - deaths in Canada . . .  Canada  . . . out of how many people?  25 million?  And people are going nuts, acting like it's an epidemic.  If my memory serves me, these people all had low immune systems for one reason or another.  For other immune-suppressed people, sure, take whatever precautions you think are necessary.  For the rest of us - take a chill pill.  As for me, I'm pretty sure it's just my usual "sickness".  For lack of a better term.  It knocks me out enough to not be able to go to work for a day or so, so to me that's stronger than a cold.  But I'm rarely attached to the porcelain throne, so it's not really a flu, either.  I'm just miserable, often with a sore throat, and complete void of any energy.  And a little nauseous.  About 50% of the time it ends up being strep throat.  But seeing as my GP is out of town and I don't like any of the other doctors at the clinic, I'll tough it out this time.  OK, now that you all know my medical history . . . *L*  I'm going back to the couch and the TV to veg and be miserable . . .

        The Lottery      I think everyone and their dog has a Super 7 ticket or two by now.  And now I can proudly proclaim that I am not an exception.  I don't normally buy lottery tickets on a regular basis, but seeing as it was the theme of last nights' Friends episode, and it was scrolling across the bottom of the screen . . . well, I figured I'd be an idiot to not get a ticket.  And I'm sure everyone has some little feeling that they're gonna win.  I'm sure you're all great people, but I'll break it to you gently - I picked the winning numbers today.  We pooled at work today (as I'm sure most people have done), and I bought a couple extra for myself (is that cheating?).  It was kind of funny - I got sent out to buy them, but I'd never played the Super 7 before.  My first stop was at a little family-run convenience store, and the oriental lady behind the counter was very hard to understand.  I messed up and didn't quite get what I'd expected, so I made another stop after picking up cash, and got one more for the group and a couple for myself.  Isn't it fun to imagine what you'd do with that kind of money?  Even $25M split 6 ways is still just over $4M - more than I'd know what to do with!  And it would be even sweeter because it's just us women at work that pooled . . . can you imagine the chaos that would be created in a small business where basically all the office staff quit at once? =)  That's the best part of the imaginings . . .   Well, I guess only tonight's draw will tell . . .

        Birthday Season      Gotta love the Catholic philosophy on family planning.  Thanks to it, 5 out of 6 birthdays in my family fall within 3 months of each other (and all us kids are exactly 2 years apart, give or take a month - except for the youngest, but that requires too much explanation for parentheses).  This sucks when you're broke! *L*  March 10 kicks it off with my oldest (younger) bro's b-day . . . Leah's on March 26 . . . April 23, the middle bro . . . April 26, mum . . . May 9, my dad (non-issue) and another good friend's . . . May 14 - Mine! =)  Then I have one in June, one in July for friends, and my baby bro's isn't until Nov 1.  There is only one thing I want this year, so I figure I'll spread the word -    Gift certificates for Swizzle Sticks!     The last few years, us kids have gotten my mum gc's for that place (Mother's Day, b-day, Christmas), and I've listened to her rave about how great it is.  I want it to be my turn this year. =)  I've only ever had one facial, and it was in Indonesia, and it felt like they were trying to scrape the skin off my face.  Had they succeeded and replaced it with better skin, I would have been happy.  But no, I left with my own skin, only it was red and very irritated.  Of course, if friends are reading this, don't feel obligated - I'm always tickled pink and grateful for whatever I get.  It's just one thing I really want this year, and I figured I'd increase my chances of getting it if I tell everyone the same thing. =)  The bf's already been drilled about this. *L*  Speaking of which - I've been taking far too long deciding what I'm going to get Leah!  I'm chronically late with b-day gifts the last few years, it seems.  Oh well - my excuse is I'm trying to extend the birthday pleasure! =)  I've always enjoyed getting a couple birthday presents late - just when you've forgotten, it's a nice surprise, and it's like it's your birthday all over again!

        Catch Up      Well, I just don't seem to have much to say this week.  So I guess I'll catch up my workouts, cuz it's 2 weeks behind now.  Friday (4th): gym (I'm psychic about these things)  Thursday (3rd): gym  Wednesday (2nd): no swimming (very sad, but I've got my excuses)  Tuesday (1st): gym  Monday (31st): no swimming  Saturday/Sunday: nothing, as usual, but guilt-free  Friday (28th): gym  Thursday (27th): no gym - too excited about seeing the house progress  Wednesday (26th): no swimming =(  Tuesday (25th): gym  Monday (24th): no swimming =(  So, a trend is beginning to appear - I'm having a hard time getting my butt in gear to go swimming on Monday and Wednesday nights.  I have to figure out a way to fix this, because I really like swimming once I actually get there.  But the bf hasn't been up to going to the gym (my initial motivation), and it sucks to drive all that way by myself in the middle of the evening.  Oh well, I'll figure out something.  But the gym is almost an addiction.  So long as I'm able to break free from work by 4:15 or 4:30 at the very latest, I don't even think twice about going.  Beyond 4:30, traffic is a nightmare and the gym is so busy I can rarely do a full workout.  Plus, I like to be home by 6:30.  So at least the gym seems to be working out (pardon the pun).  Unfortunately, the only visible progress so far is an increase in flexibility.  I hate being sweaty when I change back into my clothes, so I've gotten in the habit of taking 10 mins or so to do stretching at the end of my workout.  I can actually see an improvement!  Since the scale isn't changing, I'm glad I have  something  to keep me motivated. =)

        Did I Do The Right Thing?     Instead of contemplating the situation, I should really be preparing, but I need to expunge my thoughts.  I got a new job.  I thought I'd agreed with my outgoing boss that I'd keep working parttime in the evenings until it picked up.  I was sick on Tuesday, and came back on Wednesday to pandemonium.  A job ad had been placed without my knowledge or input (I had actually volunteered to do just that the day before), and resumes had already been submitted.  It turns out he changed his mind and wanted someone in  tout suite  so I could train them before I left.  So I started looking over them, but didn't see any that really jumped out at me.  There were 12 in total:  8 were grossly overqualified people with engineering degrees from foreign countries, 3 were supposedly recent or about to be recent grads from the same program as me, and one wanted a change of pace from his current career in telecommunications or something.  So later that day, I ended up going out for coffee with a friend.  I knew she was desperate for a new job.  Even though I knew my boss wanted someone technically knowledgeable, I did the math:    friend who needs job  +  boss who won't leave me alone until I have replacement  =  me not having to read resumes, interview strangers, and then train one of said strangers.  So I suggested it to my boss this morning.  Said if you're really that desperate to have someone in here right away, I have a friend who can be here tomorrow morning.  I said - very truthfully - that I could teach her all she needs to know, but that she wouldn't be able to do as much technical stuff as I do right now.  It seemed like a win-win situation at the time - friend gets job she thinks is just the bomb, boss gets replacement on short notice.  But it leaves me feeling slightly guilty.  I know the company would probably do better with someone who had the background knowledge to eventually do more with the position (like I had intended to do), but I also feel like I wasn't left with many choices.  I could have taken another 3 weeks or so to see if any really good candidates applied, and then could spend half the time training them.  I'm not saying my friend isn't capable - just that she's not familiar with the industry, and there's a lot more I'll need to explain to her so she can do a good job.  But no, everything's got to be a huge panic.  I know my boss well enough that I should have anticipated this, but I guess I was worrying about other things at the time.  So now I'm filled with self-doubt.  Despite his assurance that he doesn't, is he going to hold this against me?  I don't want to lose another potential reference.  Is my friend going to be overwhelmed by what there is to learn?  Am I going to make her feel dumb trying to teach her this stuff?  Is she going to hold me responsible if this job isn't all she thought it was going to be?  Is my boss going to hold me responsible if she decides it's not her thing in 6 months?  Am I going to be able to teach her everything in the little time I have?  Am I going to make it sound too complicated?  Basically, if things don't work out, is either party going to hold me responsible?  I think it's a little much that this was all put on me to begin with.  Although it was said half-jokingly (my grandpa says all joking is at least 50% true feelings), I was basically told that since I was inconveniencing the company by quitting, the least I could do was find and train my replacement  yesterday .  I don't know many companies who put this much responsibility on their employees.  Heck, I even offered to continue working for a while.  But I don't want to be responsible for this indefinitely.  I'd like to add that I gave them 2 weeks' notice.  Yesterday, one of the field techs up and quit with  no  notice.  Maybe in hindsight I should have done the same.    Even though I've given up on church and religion over the last several years, you may find me praying for help to get through the next few weeks gracefully.  Because not only am I still going to be stressing over a job I've technically quit, I'm going to be learning new rules and a new job description.  And the new company uses the old company for work on occasion, so grace is going to be of utmost importance.  I think I need a beer. =)

        Conspiracy Theory du Jour     I cannot claim credit for this, as my bf is the conspiracy theorist in the house.  Has anyone else noticed this "coincidence"??  The Canadian dollar was making unusual (and encouraging) gains about a month ago.  Up to nearly $0.75 to the USD after only a couple of weeks, compared to the $0. 65 or less it had been for ages.  And then comes along a sole case of MadCow disease in Alberta.  And the dollar starts to slide back down.  If it hadn't been for that incidence, the Canadian dollar might still be holding strong, if not still making gains.  And who was the first to close their borders to Canadian beef imports?  Coincidence, I ask?  I'll let you think about it.

      Well, I suppose I should post.  I just haven't felt like it lately.  It's going to be a busy two weeks for me, depending on what gets decided.  I hand in my notice this morning, and I've already given my suggestions to my supervisor.  I told him that, at the rate work has been coming in lately, I would have no problems continuing to do work for them in the evenings.  And when it started to pick up, I could train someone new in the evenings.  Of course, I still have to run this by my new employer, because if they have a problem with it, I'm not going to jeopardize the new job for the sake of the old.  In which case I'll need to figure out my job description and run a few ads.  5 weeks plus 5 days til the new house . . . why oh why did I have to get ambitious right now?  It's my own fault - but it would have been nice to stay here until just after I'd moved in.  Oh well,  c'est la vie.   I'm excited, but I'm not.  I'll be going from doing next to nothing all day, to possibly doing more than a full days' work.  But that's OK - it's only short-term, and it'll mean more income at a crucial time.  Well, I'd better finish my letter and call up the new company.

        Don't Give Me That Look     Thanks to the great example of a fellow blogger,  urlLink Desiree , the impending "swimsuit season", and a host of other reasons, I want to get serious about losing a little weight.  Some people I know give me a disgusted look when I say this, so I avoid the subject around them.  These same people can recite the WW point-value of almost every single food out there, and it drives me nuts.  Other friends understand that it's all relative.  Just because someone else may desire to lose 50lbs, or 70lbs, or 100lbs - or perhaps even aspires to the figure I have - doesn't mean I should be looked down on because I would feel better with a leaner frame.  I want to do something about it before I wake up one morning and realize I've got 50lbs to lose instead of 20.   If only stupid things didn't keep coming up just as I make this resolution . . . *L*  That's my biggest problem, it seems.  I make a mental resolution to establish some sort of routine, and then something comes along to shake things up.  I can make a list as long as my arm of excuses I've used just in the past year.  I honestly have the best intentions, I'm just very easily influenced into changing my priorities.  What's the saying?  "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" . . .   It's hard to choose going to the gym over seeing the new house - the gym will still be there in another 2 months, but the house changes every day.  I was doing fairly well at going to the gym after work - I'd leave around 4pm, and get there early enough to beat the after-work rush.  But now, I'm driving the bf to and from school (so we don't have to pay for parking, and so I can still do bank runs for work), and that's thrown things off as well.  And now with the sunburn . . . it's always something.  I have personally banned the word "diet" from my vocabulary . . . I admit that I could eat better, and I do try, but I refuse to resort to counting food points or calories.  There's paying attention to what goes in your mouth, and then there's obsession.  (No offense meant to anyone who abides by Weight-Watchers successfully - it's just my personal opinion.)  So the only reliable method of weight-loss (or maintenance) for me is through exercise.  So - next week, it's back to the gym for me.  The plan is to get my butt off the couch just after dinner, and aim to be at the gym around 7pm.  By then, it's died down enough so that I'm not spending half my time waiting for equipment to become available.  I can still get home in time to watch my favorite shows, which don't tend to be on until 9 or 10pm.  4 days a week is the goal.  I guess we'll see if I can stick to it . . .   And kudos to Desiree, who seems to be making excellent progress with her own resolution.  Also to  urlLink Leah , who goes swimming all the time now (perhaps motivated by the recent appearance of hotties in the pool? *L*), and my other friend Daisy, who's going to yoga classes.  You guys rock!

        Random Thoughts for a Thursday      The Weekend    The weekend was good.  Saturday was spent at C&T's place - they just bought a house.  The guys did their thing - the back steps needed fixing, as did the furnace.  I think I carted the dog there and back about 3 times.  It's only a 2-3 minute drive, but I still can't wait until he's old enough that we can take him more places and not worry about him being a puppy (getting up to no good).  Sunday was extremely lazy.  Visited with some friends who will be our neighbours when we move.  I like them lots.  Sat around, watched their big-screen-satellite-TV, drank a beer or two . . . an excellent way to spend a Sunday. =)  And Monday we went mini-golfing with S&J, which is where I got sunburned.  For once, I wasn't competitive, which meant it was a very pleasant game.  Then, we went back to their place and played Super Mario Party, which they'd borrowed from C&T.  It was lots of fun, because we were pretty much equal in skill level.  It kinda sucks to play with C&T, because none of us stand a chance of winning, and it's not really fun.  Anyone else find that games aren't as much fun when you know who's gonna win from the start?    Countdown    Tomorrow will be 6 weeks to move-in day . . . we're gonna need to start packing soon.  No more of this 'just thinking about it' . . .     The Interview    The interview went OK on Tuesday.  I felt pretty relaxed, thought I did a decent job of answering their questions, got a few of my own answered.  But they did a 'behavioural' interview - I'm not a big fan of those.  There were three guys interviewing me . . . one did a monotone presentation about the company and read his questions straight from his booklet, another only contributed here and there, and the third guy was the best.  Whenever I seemed stumped by one of the questions, he'd clarify what they were really looking for.  He seemed to have a much better idea of the true purpose of the interview, and did a very good job of making me feel more at ease.  The worst question of the interview?  "Have you ever encountered conflict in the workplace?  How did you deal with it?"  I should have had some stock answer prepared in advance, but I'm too honest sometimes, and it's always getting me into trouble.  I opened my mouth before thinking, and then looked like an idiot while I paused trying to figure out how to get out of this one gracefully.  There's no such thing with me.  See, I've been fired from two jobs in a row now.  Not something I'm proud of, and it caused me incredible grief and consternation for some time.  The first one was a summer position.  At the end, they got to do a review on me, which would be made available to HR.  The last two questions - Would you (the supervisors) hire this person back again? and Would you recommend any other department hire them? - and I got a resounding "NO" for both.  It didn't come as a huge surprise - we didn't get along from the start, and I've since found out (a good friend still works there) that my supervisor's opinion is definitely the minority.  Whatever.  And the second time, I admit that my attitude at work stunk, but I was stressed about school, and once that was over, I made a conscious decision to improve.  Despite this - and despite my boss admitting that I'd improved - he stated reason after invalid reason that I was a terrible employee that he had to let go.  I got the feeling that he was being pressured to fire me by another employee who didn't like me.  Guess I'll never know.  Anyways, stupid me volunteered "yes" to the question in the interview.  Gave very bare and sugar-coated details of the first job.  Tried to recover by saying that we got off to a bad start and it never recovered from there, but that I'd learned a valuable lesson from it, and it hadn't happened again.  Unfortunately, there seemed to be a few more questions throughout the interview about interpersonal conflict and its resolution . . . I mean, really.  How honest do you think someone's going to be in an interview?    "How would you deal with someone who was being difficult?"  Well, depending on how important that working relationship is, and how closely you work together, and how difficult they're being . . . there's an infinite number of responses.  Overall, I think I did pretty well, but you never really know until you get that last phone call.  Either they thought you were the best candidate, or they feel someone else is.  I'll find out next week.    More Job Possibilities    In the meantime, a friend/mentor with a really big oil & gas company alerted me to another opportunity.  Now I'm torn.  I gave her my resume and she's going to recommend me for the position (as it was only advertised internally) . . . but the competition doesn't close until June 6.  I'm trying not to think about it until it's actually an issue.  Although I have been trying to weigh the pros and cons.   Current job:   - Very flexible work hours.  This weighs very heavily at the moment . . . I like the freedom of being able to come and go when there's nothing to do, and not having to worry about someone getting on my back about it.  The emphasis is on getting a job done, not on clocking X hours a day - Very close to home - No opportunity for advancement - what I'm doing now is all I'll ever be doing - Very relaxed dress code, I can wear jeans and a T-shirt every day if I want - Blatantly corrupt environment, with lots of disgruntled employees and lots of grumbling that goes on when the boss is away (very often).  I don't want to be sucked in by that   First job opportunity:  - New position in a small company - I would be creating my own job description, to an extent - Lots of opportunity to learn from people, room for advancement for at least a good few years - More of a career than a job, current position is more of a job - Downtown - I miss the atmosphere, and going for lunch with friends who work in the area - Possibly a 'clock-punching' mentality - I didn't get a good enough read from the interview to determine if this is the case or not - More strict dress code, but that doesn't bother me too much - Evil word - commute.  It will probably involve public transit in some capacity, and definitely an earlier rise in the morning   Second job opportunity:  - Not even really an opportunity at this point - haven't even been selected for an interview - Big company - many more future opportunities for lateral or upward advancement - Big company - tendency to 'get lost in the crowd' and become anonymous (this is good and bad depending on the situation) - Big company - potential for bigger salary??  not sure about this one yet - Downtown again - same pros and cons as above  There's a lot to think about, but as I said, it may not even be an issue if Opportunity #1 offers the job to someone else.

      Everything annoys me today.  This morning, the bf was hyper for some reason.  I'm not a morning person - I can't handle hyper people in the morning.  It made me feel bad cuz I was grouchy with him.  The dog was annoying me.  Every time he pressed his wet nose against my bare skin, I wanted to scream.  Once or twice, I think I actually growled at him.  That made me feel bad too - he's just a puppy, it's what he does.  The cats didn't annoy me, because they're usually pretty scarse in the morning.  I like that about them . . . especially Stupid.  When she wants attention, she's very clear about it.  She'll jump up on my lap, head-butt my hand or chin, and sit quietly until she's had her fill.  I think all I needed this morning is a hug.  But sometimes I don't realize that until I'm already at work. =(  Suck it up, princess.

       Word of the day:    SUNBURN   I'm in pain.  Everyone's asking me how the heck I got sunburned yesterday, because there wasn't any sun.  Believe me people, I don't just turn painfully red spontaneously.  And not by choice.  More like by stupidity.  First sunny day of the summer, I always get sunburned.  I seem to forget over the winter just how powerful the sun is on fair, red-headed skin.

      OK, I'll try this again.  My day went from ho-hum and dreary to hopeful and exciting with one solitary phone call.  Remember my ongoing quest for a new job?  Well, a career is more accurate.  And remember how I applied for one specific position a couple of weeks back?  Well, it had been a week since I faxed in my marks, so I figured it was fair enough for me to call in to inquire about the status of the position.  Has it been filled?  Great - I can keep looking.  Still deciding?  Great - I know to keep waiting.  I called up, and the HR director exclaimed, "Ohhh, Angela!  I'm so glad to hear from you.  I was actually going to call you later today to see if you could come in for an interview."  Right on!  This makes me very hopeful.  In the past, every interview I've had (with the exception of one) resulted in a job offer.  I'm not saying that's how it will go this time, I'm just saying that's how it's been for me in the past.  I got first pick of interview slots - there were 6.  So I picked first thing on the first morning.  Tuesday at 8am (the choices were 8am or 10am, Tues/Wed/Thurs).  However, should it go well, I'm not looking forward to the ugly task of handing in my notice.  I don't want to leave them hanging here, but ideally they would want 6 weeks or so of notice.  Not very practical, but I intend to do all I can to help them out if I leave.  Ideally, for both parties, the woman I replaced (who went on mat. leave) wants to come back, and things stay slow enough that I can handle just doing contract work until she comes back (probably the fall).  Very little training involved (just updating her on changes/improvements I made) and it would mean extra cash for me.  As I said - ideally.  I'm getting way ahead of myself.  But sometimes it's fun imagine how things could be.  Well, I'm off for lunch now!

      Menh, words elude me today.  Think I'll stick with just reading everyone else's blog for today. =)  And revamping my car posters.  I really want to be rid of it before we move.  BTW - if anyone in Calgary might be wanting an '87 Daytona Shelby in pretty good condition (no major problems, just needs a tune-up) with new tires, cylinder, and a couple other doodads for $2000, let me know! =)  I can hook you up . . .

       Trust is Important   It's kind of funny . . . I look around at some of the relationships I see on a regular basis, and I'm often left shaking my head and thinking to myself, "Thank goodness we're/I'm/he's not like that."  I had another example this weekend.  I'll share it, since I'm pretty sure none of you personally know the people involved and won't make the situation worse. =)  I went to my bf's mom's place for dinner.  It felt weird that  she  was making dinner for  us , but the bf assured me it was what she wanted.  So we picked up some wine and a card and headed over.  The bf's brother was going to be there, too, with his wife (they just got married in January).  We were kept pretty busy making sure Rascal wasn't trampling his mom's 3 very tiny dogs/puppies, so I wasn't very aware of what was going on until a little later.  But shortly after his brother arrived with his wife, I noticed that his mom came out into the backyard and was brushing away tears.  It didn't take me long to figure out that there was news of a baby on the way.  But the wife seemed rather reluctant to talk about it.  I would have thought a newly-married couple (especially the wife) announcing a pregnancy would be all giddy.  Turns out it wasn't confirmed by a doctor yet, and the husband had spilled the beans before she'd wanted to.  She wasn't planning on telling her own mother until she'd been to the doctor's.  I felt kinda bad for her.  I also felt the smallest twinge of jealousy, but we'll gloss over that, because it's doesn't relate to my point. =)  When we got home later, I comment to the bf, "I'm so glad I know you would never do something like that."  I just couldn't marry someone that I didn't trust to keep my secrets, or at least respect my wishes to keep certain news quiet until it was appropriate.  I'm still not ready for marriage, but every day, it occurs to me that my current bf has a lot of the qualities I would want from a husband.  He's a wonderful man - albeit with the requisite annoyances, but ones I can live with - and sometimes I feel guilty for not always telling him so.  Then again, that's another thing I love about him - he's not mushy.  Neither am I, so I don't feel pressured to be mushy.  It works for us.  But it's still nice to find ways to tell each other how much we appreciate the other.  Hmmm, I wonder if all these musings have something to do with an anniversary (2 years! *s*) coming up . . .

       Requisite 'Survivor' Commentary   Is it just me, or were there too many good shows on last night?  With Survivor taking up 3 hours from 9pm onward, there was much channel-flipping going on at my place . . .   There was the Simpsons, Survivor, and Law & Order: CI all at 9pm.  Then the Sopranos and Survivor at 10pm.  It's amazing I still managed to know what was going on . . .   How on earth did Jenna - as Jeff put it himself, the 'whiney, 21-year-old swimsuit model' - manage to win the $1M??  And I was getting a little queasy watching her hang off Matt when they did the show from NYC.  What was up with that?  Anyone hear any rumours about them hooking up or something?  When they were headed back to camp on the last night, I blurted out "Come on - have sex!  It's the last night and there's just the two of you . . . "  But did they listen to me??  Noooooo, of course not.  That would have been entertaining . . . I'm always rooting for people to have sex on those reality TV shows . . . =)  What can I say?  I think we all have a bit of a voyeur in us . . .   Grrrr.  Whiney, lazy, self-centered Jenna won.  Going by the game's motto - Outwit, Outlast, Outplay - Rob was the one who deserved that.  But, seeing as he didn't make it to the final 2, it should have been Matt.  He was honest . . . he said so himself, how he was naive in the beginning, and did lie to a few people along the way, but he was a strong player when it came to challenges.  He contributed lots to the upkeep of the camp.  That fire sure was a nice twist, wasn't it?  I didn't feel too bad for them when that happened . . . I just couldn't believe it hadn't happened sooner.  Why the heck would you leave a fire burning - under a wooden 'fire hut' no less! - unattended for a good couple of hours??  Why??  And then to have Jenna snivel over all the irreplaceable items she lost . . . why the heck would you bring those out to the wilderness in the first place?  Serves you right . . .   Boy, I'm just so compassionate, aren't I? =)  OK - and now a rambling commentary on the appearance of some of the survivors.  Heidi was scary when she filed out for her first jury session.  Boy, oh boy.  Tone down the lipstick, hun!  I swear she looked like she was wearing a Halloween mask . . .   Matt looked much better during Survivor than post-Survivor.  I liked the goatee and sunken cheeks and protruding eyes . . . I quite enjoyed that slightly-off-kilter-sharpening-my-machete look of his . . . =)  His full cheeks and clean-shaven look post-Amazon just didn't do it for me.  By contrast, Rob looked much better in the aftermath.  If it weren't for his whiney "poor-ugly-geeky-me-who-the-girls-never-want-to-date" attitude, he'd probably have no need for that attitude.  I imagine he's had quite a few post-show groupies to raise his . . . errr . . . self-esteem.  OK, this is going back a bit, but did anyone notice that Christy was the only one with a boyfriend who showed up for the 'loved-ones' reward?  I thought that was hilarious . . . here are these young girls, always going on about how they're so much better and prettier and sexier than everyone else, and they don't even have boyfriends who'll fly to the Amazon to see them?  I was pleased to notice the slightly smug (and definitely elated) look on Christy's face that day . . .   OK, I think I'm done for now.  Feel free to comment and leave your own two cents.

        Ang, your career personality type is ESFP   That means that based on the standard measure of personality traits, you are well-balanced and place equal importance on work as on your personal life. You are dedicated to maintaining a level of culture in your life and therefore won't sacrifice interesting work for high pay.   With your high energy and chameleon-like adaptabilities, you seek work that is fast-paced and ever-changing. Working directly with people provides you with that outlet. On top of it, you have an uncanny ability to keep peace and maintain a level of serenity and happiness in your environment. If emotions flare up in the room, people look to you to pull out a story or joke that deflates the tension.   You prefer to live in the moment and appreciate what life and work offer now. The future is unknowable and does not draw you in like the present. Part of your easy-going outlook toward the future has to do with knowing that you can adapt to whatever comes your way.  The reason employers and recruiters might be on the lookout for you is that only about 8% of the U.S. population shares the unique characteristics of your personality type. Research shows that businesses succeed when employers create a good balance of personality types in the office. And since only 8% of the U.S. population shares your type, that means employers are looking for you.

        Ang, you're likely to find fame and fortune in the Natural World   You're an outdoors kind of person who has a special connection with the natural world around you. In fact, you'd probably rather be outside right now. And that's cool - because that's where your future is. For you, there's no better playground or place to feel at home than when you're out amidst rivers, canyons, mountains, or jungles. The truth is, nature never disappoints, and it always seems to energize and relax you.  So draw on that innate connection you've got to the great outdoors. Whether you're reflecting on a flaming sunset, the pounding of waves on a beach, or the majesty of a mountain peak, let yourself be inspired. Fame and fortune await! So if you're wondering how you can contribute to the greater appreciation of the natural world, just remember: The planet's rainforests need protecting, someone has to save the orangutans, and hey, maybe there really is something to be learned from inner tubing down Mount Everest. So get out there and heed that call of the wild! It's waiting for you.

        Ang, your values help make you a Gentle Protector   You're one of those rare people who'll typically go out of your way to protect the vulnerable from harm. You also appear to be more personally concerned about situations that violate innocents' rights than many people are. This kind of empathy, coupled with your ordinarily giving nature, can make you a real crusader for the underdog. Interestingly enough, it seems your care for other living things goes beyond your fellow humans. As a result, it's likely that you count yourself as a friend and protector of the earth around you, as well.    If you're bored, go check out  urlLink Emode .  They've got tonnes of cool tests you can take to find out useless things like this. =)

      My friend Shannon makes me happy.  Well, all my friends make me happy, but her especially today.  She's such a spunky girl.  And she's always so much fun to talk to.  I worked with her 2 summers ago, and we became instant friends.  After that job ended for me, we didn't see much of each other, but still managed lunch every now and then because I still worked downtown and school was just a short train ride to downtown.  But since she went back to school this past year, we've barely seen each other at all - just the odd email to remind each other that we're still alive. =)  But she's able to come out for my birthday tomorrow, and that makes me happy.  And if I get a job downtown before the summer is over, we can go for lunch again like we used to.

      On a slightly more positive note, I got called about that job I really wanted that I thought had been filled.  Turns out they had 150+ applicants, and the poor engineer had to sort through all of them.  They narrowed it down to 23, and were asking for transcripts to narrow it further.  I'm anxiously waiting for another phone call, because I got pretty darn good marks.  Despite one seriously slacker semester, I made the President's List all 5 semesters, and pulled off an overall GPA of 3.83 (out of 4.00).  Not that I'm tooting my own horn or anything. =)  It would probably make me very happy to just get an interview . . . I'm tired of jobs, and I want a career at this point.  I'm tired of feeling stalled career-wise because I keep choosing my jobs because I'm desperate, and not because I think they're a good fit for me.  I want to change that, and finally start a career.  Then, when I get bored of that, I'll have kids. *LOL*  Just kidding.

      Something's bugging me, and I just don't know what.  Despite all the great things going on in my life, I've been in a funk the last week or so, and I don't know how to shake it because I don't know what's causing it.  I used to be hyper-analytical about anything and everything going on in my life, but it made me a constant emotional wreck, so I learned to stop.  Maybe I went too far the other way.  I'm sure the boredom isn't helping.  But that can't be the only reason, can it?  When I was in my post-secondary days, I got this ailment I dubbed "the 2-month itch."  It never failed that, 2 months into a new semester, or a summer of working, I would get this incredible sense of restlessness, like I was going to crawl out of my skin and needed to completely overhaul my life.  I would usually manage to create some kind of drama or crisis, and if I was in school, it would mess up my entire semester.  My marks would take a nose-dive, I would start skipping classes all the time, and often missing homework deadlines.  If it was the summer (or in my year off), I started slacking off at work and got a really bad attitude.  I think it's under control now, but I definitely get it from my mother.  Not that I would ever tell her to her face, because she's my mother after all and I love her, but she can be one heck of a drama queen.  There's always something traumatic going on in her mind - be it problems with co-workers, problems with divorce settlement issues (sadly, still), behaviour problems with my youngest brother, or some sort of illness.  Still - could this be my problem?  A x-month itch?  I feel disconnected . . . like I'm aware of all these things going on, and I know I should be happy and excited and grateful, but I just don't  feel  anything.  Except maybe guilt.  I feel guilt a lot because I've been rather fed up with the dog lately.  I know, in my head, that lots of the things he does is just part of him being a puppy.  But the whining gets to me, having to wash my sole pair of jeans every other day because he's always jumping up with muddy paws gets to me, the constant no-rascals, down-rascals, off-rascals get to me.  And I feel guilty.  Although I never enjoyed being alone much, maybe I miss having the option of retreating to my own apartment every once and a while.  But I don't feel stifled or anything.  Maybe I'm jealous of my friends who still don't have to worry about rent, or utilities, or paying back student loans that cost as much as a new car, and who can plan impromtu weekend trips and still have the energy and motivation to party at a moments' notice.  But that was never really me in the first place, so I don't think that's right, either.  Or maybe I'm just a girl who's prone to mood swings for no reason every now and then.  Yeah, I think I can live with that.  It doesn't require any work on my part. *L*

       Gah!!   I'm a horrible pet-mom.  Here I've been, going on and on about the dog, and making all these efforts to put up pictures of him, and I don't even have any of my adored cats!  The bf would bug me for including his cat in this, but I love her just as much as my own.  As much as she's  his  cat, I feel I have a special bond with her, too.  So - the next round of pictures will include Tigger and Stupid!  (She's definitely  his  cat when it comes to explaining her name, though!)  Don't worry - in real life, they still get a lot of attention from me.  They're still my preferred company, much as I love the puppy.

       I have far too much time to think these days.   I just wrote a post, hesitated, deleted part of it, hesitated some more, and then erased the whole thing.  Why do I do that?  It had to do with journals and blogs and exes and growing up.  But I got mental constipation and didn't like how it was all coming out.  I don't like talking about my only real ex.  There's no emotional attachment to any memories from that time, and I think that's why it feels kinda wrong.  I talk/write about things that are on my mind, or that are concerning me, and since I've pretty much excised those thoughts from my mind, it feels like a waste of space to even bring it up.  It's kinda like going to a therapist and paying good money to rehash something you've dealt with and put away.  Maybe it's because  urlLink Moxie  is rather introspective lately, and it's reminding me of similar times.  She's a very interesting woman with a lot of good stuff to say.  Do you ever feel some of your memories aren't really your own?  That's how I feel about certain times in my life.  I remember things, and I know I lived through them, but they're so detached emotionally that it feels like they were just put there.  So that I had something by which to entertain myself when I got bored.  Like a movie.  It's very weird.

       A Rant on Student Loans   I think the government should run programs to help out the 90% of us (OK, I don't know the exact number) that graduate with ridiculous student loans.  Like a 25% reduction/bursary if you graduate with an Honours distinction.  Chaching - knock $3100.00 off for me.  And how about another 10% for those who worked on a regular basis during the school year? - deduct another $1550.00.  And just for kicks, how about free schooling for 5 years post-grad for those who get incredibly bored like me? *L*  I don't believe in free rides or anything, but at least reward the people who obviously got something out of going to school.  And who are likely to become valuable contributors to the economy.  As  urlLink zak  would say "whine, whine, bitch, moan."

      GodamIeverbored.  Pleaseshootme.  Or give me $500 so I can take a distance education course. *L*  My boss/supervisor came in today and volunteered - "If you have any personal stuff to take care of, now's a good time to do it.  If you need any time off for anything, feel free to take it."  Translation:  "I realize there's been nothing to do, and I don't really care if you're here or not at the moment."  Cool.  Except I don't really need the time off right now.  It doesn't really matter - I could sit at home, going stir crazy, or I can sit here, and at least have a few people to socialize with.  In another month or so, the circus of packing will begin, but more likely than not, it'll be at least another 6 weeks.  I got bummed yesterday.  I called up the company I applied to, to find out the status of the position.  In a rather uppity/curt voice, the receptionist informed me that they had 'made their final selections.'  Translation: "If you haven't heard anything yet, you're a loser and we don't want you, so don't bother me."  I thought I was wearing my very polite and sugary voice for that phone call.  Guess not.  I got somewhat un-bummed this morning.  Despite there being very few new job postings lately, there was one that was written like it was just for me.  "Are you a recent graduate in Petroleum Engineering Technology looking for an opportunity to work for a high profile Oil & Gas company?"  How did you know??  "We may have an opportunity for you."  Great!!  Tell me more . . . "Excellent starting wage, benefit options and a brand new career will be just a few of the perks."  So what's the catch?  Sign me up!  "Candidates must have a working knowledge of MS Word and Excel."  Uh oh, sounds a little like a receptionist/admin assistant position, but what the heck?  Turns out it's being advertised with a staffing agency that I have a history with.  So I'm hoping my phone call gets returned soon and I can find out more.  Wanna know some useless facts?  For my designation of T.T. (technologist in training) in the province of Alberta, 48 people in my field filled out a salary survey in 2002:  Lowest basic salary: $24,000.00 Highest basic salary: $85,000.00 Range in experience: 1 to 8 years Average yrs of experience: 2.00 Avg basic salary: $44,345.00 Avg bonus earnings: $6,801.11 Avg total income: $50,670.90  Wow, I hope by this time next year I've jumped the $8,345.00 to meet the average basic salary.  "Be happy with what you have" - pshaw, then they shouldn't publish things like this.

        Restless in Calgary    I wish I wasn't so restless at work lately.  If I don't get a new job, or if things don't pick up soon, I'm liable to do something crazy like sign up for a distance education course.  Crazy, huh?  It's always been in the back of my mind to have an accounting-related career:  I love numbers, I love math, and I love money.  =)  But I've chosen my career at the moment, so going back to school fulltime for a university degree is just not something I'm up for.  And I quite like the industry I'm in, I just want to specialize a little more.  It's becoming damn near impossible with all the dead-end jobs I keep choosing.  So I figured I'd check out the local "distance education" university -  urlLink Athabasca University.   They have some basic financial accounting courses, and the fees are pretty reasonable - about $500/course.  It's just a matter of coming up with the $$ . . . but tuition credits sure are nice when tax season rolls around.  And it doesn't help that my bf is at school for the next two months.  Every day, I drop him off and pick him up at the same school I went to, and I realize how much I miss it.  I'm  almost  but not quite jealous when he has to do homework.   Almost .  But not quite.  It won't be long before I really AM jealous.

      What IS it about Mondays that inspires me to simply ramble on about unimportant things?  I just don't know, but it seems to happen every Monday.  I don't really have anything useful, or insightful, or witty to say . . . just a lot of babble. =)  I like all the suggestions for names for my car.  I've never been much for naming things, especially inanimate objects, but I'm enjoying this.  I'll give it some more thought and announce a winner tomorrow, how's that? =)  No monetary prizes, or claim to fame, but there will be a link in the post.  Ohhhh, the suspense now . . . *L*  Well, I took ___________ (currently unnamed vehicle) in for it's first oil change today.  Honda is very elite in that they have "Type x" for different maintenance appointments.  For example, with my car being so new, after 8000km, it only requires a Type 1 Maintenance, meaning basically an oil change, fluid top-up, and brief visual inspection of various parts.  At a cost of $38.88, it is rather competitive, so I see no reason to take it anywhere else.  However, Type 2 (next at 16000km) is a little more comprehensive.  However, when I bought this vehicle, one thing the salesman tried to push as a selling feature was Honda's dedication to customer service - namely their courtesy shuttle, downtown express, and loaner vehicles available to anyone booked in for a service appointment.  Since an oil change doesn't quite warrant the use of a loaner vehicle, I asked for a ride to and from work.  I was asked for the address and told this would be no problem.  I arrived a half-hour early for my appointment, handed over my keys, and sat down to wait for the courtesy driver.  He came in, and asked the few of us sitting in the waiting area where we were headed.  The two other people needing rides were heading west (my work is a short drive east from the dealership), so he said the next driver would get me.  The next driver came a few minutes later, and by then two more people had joined the "needing rides" group.  They were both headed to the outskirts of downtown, and once more I was left behind.  In the end, by the time the first driver returned, my car was ready to go.  It wasn't a huge deal, as work is really slow and nobody minded that I showed up at 10am.  At least for next time, I know that it'll be easier just to wait for the car.  So that was my (un-)eventful morning. =)  The weekend was busy - little errands that, when stacked up, just ate up the whole weekend.  I'm eagerly waiting for  urlLink Leah's  account of her Skybar experience.  I live vicariously through my friends these days. =)  For lil ol' me, my weekend went something like this:  Saturday - sleeping in!  Yay!  Take Rascal for an outing to the pet store, as we're out of puppy food and rawhide bones.  That was an event, because ARF was having their Adoptation, meaning the store was packed with people and dogs.  We probably would never have seen Rascal again if he hadn't been on a leash!  He loves saying Hi to people and dogs alike.  We attempted to check out the new house (again!) with him still in tow, but that proved somewhat challenging, as he was pretty tired from the pet store.  So there were no protests when we dropped him off at home - he went to sleep right away.  Then I headed out again to show my mum the new house, and by the time I drove her home and got home myself, I was pooped.  I passed out on the couch for about an hour before we headed over to a friends to watch a movie and just hang out.  Sunday - more sleeping in!  Yay!  I like sleeping in . . . but the neighbours (upstairs) got a head-start on their laundry, and we ended up just sitting around all afternoon waiting for the washer to stop so we could take showers.  Did some housework (darn muddy puppy paw prints everywhere!), met a friend for coffee, a little more housework, and finally the washer stopped.  Then some vegging while watching Law & Order: CI/Simpsons, then Sopranos/Family Guy.  It's insane - my boyfriend is simply incapable of watching just one show at a time.  We always end up missing little snippets of various shows because he's constantly switching between at least two. =)~  See??  Nothing momentus, and yet I can ramble on . . . and on . . . and on . . .   I'm hoping I have the energy to make it to swimming tonight, since my gym schedule is kind of on hold while we have to carpool, and I'm missing regular physical activity (and dog walks just don't cut it, since he's still too young to make it very far).

      Something has occurred to me lately, and if I still have any readers left, I'd like to know what you think, too.  It seems that a lot of people I know have this common opinion - that things in life that are commonly considered "good" should never involve negative emotions.  Let me give you an example . . . I was sharing with some people a story - in the short week-and-a-bit that our upstairs neighbours have been home, I've spoken with each at least once.  You know, "How's it going with the new baby?"  Both their reactions have been a big sigh, and then something along the lines of "there have been a few rough nights" usually followed by "but when it's good, it's good."  Their reaction didn't surprise me, but the people I was relaying the story to seemed almost shocked.  It was like they thought that people shouldn't have negative emotions or things to say about something as wonderful as a new baby.  They figured the sigh must have had more to do with my question (and the fact that they probably get asked it all the time) than an actual response.  And another example - my new job.  I've shared with some people the fact that I'm not overjoyed by it, even though I was looking forward to it so much.  But I always add that I knew that I would miss certain things about my old job.  I knew I had to trade certain things for other things I wanted more.  But it seemed like they were trying to tell me that I shouldn't be having (or at least expressing) these negative things because it was something I was looking forward to.  I just don't agree.  Even the good things in life are going to have ups and downs, and shouldn't we feel free to express  both  sides with our friends?  I thought nothing of it when our neighbours openly expressed their exhaustion (with the new baby).  And I hardly even know them.  Maybe the whole matter boils down to learning which people you only deliver the sugar-coated and superficial good news to, and which people you can talk with frankly and openly to.  In case you couldn't tell, I'm lacking the "frank and open" types lately. =)

      So life seems a little cheerier these days.  I've been a little depressed over the realization that I don't really have any good friends.  And then someone reminded me that it's better to have one good friend than a dozen fairweather ones.  So I was happy again, cuz I was hanging out with that good friend at the time.  Don't get me wrong - I consider my bf to be my best friend, but a girl (and guy) gotta have their own friends to hang out with every now and then, otherwise things get stale.  And it makes me even happier to see my friend so happy these days.  She deserves goodness in her life, and she deserves to feel like things are worth smiling about.  She deserves to feel like life can be exciting and have infinite possibilities.

        No Pain, No Gain    Only problem is, I don't know what I'm trying to gain.  Folks, I've managed to do it again.  We went out today to a buddy's farm (absolutely gorgeous weather for it, too - 31oC was the forecast).  I just bought tanning lotion yesterday, and figured it would be a good way to get started on my tan.  Of course, I brought along sunscreen as well - I'm not stupid.  But apparently I am.  Even though I didn't think I'd started to burn by the time I put the sunscreen on, it stung, and I knew that was a bad sign.  I decided to sit in the shade for the rest of the afternoon (as the men went off gopher hunting - I never got one unfortunately) . . . and I started getting so red and stiff.  Now, I'm in pain once again.  I am one hot momma right now.  And I just downed the last Tylenol 3 in the house - it's going to be a looooonnnnggg night.

        It's Everywhere, I Tell You    Egad, I'm starting to regret having offered continuing support for my old job.  Last night was the first night I had to go in, and I only stopped between jobs long enough to eat some dinner.  And I didn't get home until 9:30pm.  And boy was I grouchy . . . oh well, I don't think I'll have to do it too many times.  But that's not really the point of this whole post.  Babies are everywhere all of a sudden.  We share the house with another couple who lives upstairs (separate suites, of course), and the wife/girlfriend has been pregnant since they moved in in November.  We found out this month that she was due June 22, and yesterday afternoon they'd left for the hospital.  We finally saw their car pull up late last night.  I spent half the night in a light sleep, woken up at the slightest sound.  And of course, I would then strain to find out if it was a baby crying (as we couldn't tell if it was just the husband/bf that came home, or the whole little family).  And I spent the other half of the night dreaming about how clueless I would be if I got sent home from the hospital with a baby to care for.  I have this intense curiosity when it comes to babies lately.  I haven't really been around babies since my youngest brother was born, and I was 6 at the time.  So now I'm seeing babies and pregnant women everywhere I go.  I told you I'd be prone to this baby-fever thing.  I still maintain that I'm not going to have one of my own yet.

        Big Changes    I was going to post about this earlier, but then didn't want to be guilty of spilling the beans too early.  On Friday, the bf went out golfing with a couple of his friends.  He came home with a big announcement - a good friend of his was going to be a daddy.  This came as shocking news, even though I should have expected it.  They've been married 4 years now (even though they're only 24), and they're perfect potential parents in that they're not big partiers and don't mind staying at home lots.  We have another couple who are very similar to them, and I'm willing to bet that they make the same announcement within 6 months.  That's just the way these two couples are - a  tad  on the competitive side.  (Just as an example, the last time us three couples got together, the youngest guy of the bunch - 2 years younger than the other two - proceeded to talk down to and give advice to my bf regarding owning a house, seeing as we'll be the last to take possession of ours.  He preached about how we didn't realize just how many things would need to be done in the first few months, and how we were going to need more money than we thought.  Etc.  Etc.  Read:  I'm older and wiser about this stuff because we're 6 months ahead of you.  He even proceeded to brag that by the end of the year, he and his wife would have made more money than us.  Needless to say, this didn't go over very well.)  So I'm very glad that we've started to make non-baby-planning couple friends.  I have nothing against people who want families - it's just not where we're at (heck, we're not even married, so I would hope so!).  And as much as everyone says "It's your choice to do what you want" . . . if you're spending most of your free time with people who talk about babies and nothing else, you start to wonder if you're missing out on something.  And I could see myself starting to get baby fever even though I know it's not what I want right now.  You know? =)  I'm still digesting the news . . . this is the first time I've been close friends with someone who got pregnant (and especially, deliberately).  I always knew it would come, and should have expected it, since the wife just recently finished her schooling.  But it's still big news to me, and I'm having a hard time imagining how things are going to change over the next year.  I certainly don't plan to stop hanging out with them completely, because they're still good friends.  But I don't want to catch baby fever, either.   House Countdown:  2 weeks and 4 days!    Baby Due Date:  January 28, 2004

        Day Four    I don't think I've ever made such a big deal about a job change before.  Dunno why this one is different.  Anyways, I think I'm beginning to see the seeds of settling in.  Yesterday, I just about broke down in tears at work, I was so frustrated.  I was still running around in circles, and it seemed like everytime I would try to ask someone for clarification, they were either busy or not in their office.  Finally, shortly after lunch, one guy did pop by and I made him sit down and explain things some more.  I seem to work that way - I need things explained once (preferably the 'big picture' first, then the smaller details of what I'm actually supposed to do), then go away and let me see if I've got it.  I often need two or three rounds of explanation/let-me-do-it-myself cycles before something clicks, and then I'm off and running.  I think yesterday afternoon was the clicking point.  Now all my questions are just about the smaller details, and I'm sure I'll have those for weeks to come.  Now all I need to do is personalize my office a little more, and perhaps things won't seem so bad.  Plus, I'm trying to figure out how I can fit the word "active" into my lifestyle now.  By the time I get home, it's often 6pm or later (depending on what errands we have to run), and then there's dinner, and little household things, and a little vegetating, and a shower, and before you know it, it's past 10pm and I'm ready for bed.  So, after a few days of being turned down by someone I thought would be a regular lunching buddy, I've decided that maybe lunchtime would be a good time to do something.  Maybe I'll become one of those "lunchtime park bunnies" - one of those women who head out to Prince's Island and the Bow River pathway for a run at lunch.    And I intend to hold Biskette to her word . . . she said that shortly after she started getting paycheques from her new job, she'd buy a bunch of passes to the City pools, and I would have to make sure she used them.  No arguments there.  I would love to go swimming once or twice a week, but motivation is lacking lately.  Having someone to go with would definitely help.  And has anyone else discovered that when they make a personal resolution to eat better, all the "forbidden" or "bad" foods start to smell twice as appealing?  After discovering that it's fruit season, and almost everything is on sale and finally affordable, I stocked up last night.  The idea being that I would start taking lots of fruit to work with me and try to avoid all the tempting treats and dining options, if only for lunchtime.  I had visited Jugo Juice yesterday, and decided I would go back today.  I'd heard that their smoothies were basically meal equivalents, and that a 1oz shot of their "wheatgrass juice" was the same as taking in 2.5lbs of leafy green vegetables.  I figured, heck, if I can get that many veggies in a 1oz shot, it was worth a try.  It's actually not all that bad.  A little bitter and grassy (obviously), a little sweet, and all over in one small gulp.  The jury's still out on the smoothie and it's staying power.  I'll get back to you on that.  But the whole point of that way to say that, on my way to Jugo Juice today, I had to pass a chinese buffet restaurant.  And oh man, did the smells wafting out to the sidewalk ever tempt me.  So yeah, the world's not quite so dark and weepy today.

        I Feel Like Crying     But crying isn't something I really do very often, so I'll write instead.  I'm very sad tonight.  Well, I started getting sad on Friday, but it's been getting worse.  I'm starting to wonder if I made the right decision in leaving my old job when I did.  On Friday, we (meaning all my co-workers, plus Biskette) went out for lunch at noon.  We never made it back to work.  By the time I got home just after 7pm, I was completely plastered, and had a rather rough night ahead of me.  But you know how drunk people get - they say too much.  Two of the guys are Russian, one older and one younger, and the younger one was drinking up a storm.  He started gesturing wildly as he talked just as animatedly - I think he might have had a little crush on me.  Poor Biskette - he put her through the wringer!  She was the only one not drinking, so even though nobody else was taking him seriously, she was.  I kept trying to convince her not to pay him any attention.  Anyways.  I really enjoyed myself.  And even then, I started missing them, and wondering if I was doing the right thing at the right time.  It had  seemed  right when I applied for the job . . . it still seemed right when they wanted me for an interview . . . but when the job offer came, I hesitated.  Of course, I eventually accepted, but I wonder if there wasn't something in my gut that told me the timing just wasn't right.  I know in my head that I'm just upset because it's a new job, and it'll take time to get used to.  I know there are lots of good things, and things I've been wanting for a long time, in this new job, and that it will open lots of doors for me.  But for now, I'm just missing what I had.  My old co-workers will be spending most of this week at the Oil & Gas Show, meeting tonnes of people, not having to do stressful work, and probably drinking.  I had that ultimate position of actually understanding what my job was about, of having insight into what would make it more efficient, and by the time I left, almost felt like an expert in what I did.  Of course, I knew there was plenty I could learn, but for my job, I was in a very comfortable position.  And it was the first job that I never felt a sense of dread about going to work.  I had enormous personal freedom, and knew exactly how far I could bend that freedom.  With it being summer now, and with moving in just over 3 weeks, it would have been very nice to have had that freedom for the whole summer.  *sigh*  And I don't think it's been helping that sleep is hard to come by.  Sunday night, of course, was pre-first-day-of-work jitters.  Didn't sleep very well.  Last night, it was the dog being sick.  He was quite for the first couple of hours, but then he started whining, and the whining got more insistent, until the bf decided maybe he really needed to pee.  So he took him out.  Came back in, but the whining continued for another while.  We figured that maybe he was just playing a game and tried to ignore it.  And then it stopped abruptly, and a horrible stench filled the room.  The bf urgently told me to turn on my bedside lamp, but we both knew what had happened - Rascal had pooped in his kennel.  My mind told me, "He wouldn't poop in his own kennel just for the heck of it.  There's gotta be something wrong."  But the rest of me was pretty darn pissed off that this had to happen at 2am.  There was no avoiding it - we were both gagging, the stench was so bad.  The dog got put outside while we cleaned it out and tried to air the place out.  About half an hour later, it's clean, and we decide maybe the kennel shouldn't be in the room, since it was doubtful that he would be quiet again.  After about an hour of trying a few things (bf thought maybe he was really hungry, or something), we finally decided to ignore the whining, and managed another hour of fitful sleep.  I think he must have quieted down at some point, but again around 5am, it suddenly started up again, and had a rather urgent tone to it.  Resigned, we both got up to find he'd done it again - and extremely runny this time.  By now I was pretty concerned (though pissed off with sleep deprivation), and started worrying about what we were going to do with him.  Was I going to have to call in sick on my second day on the job to take him to the vet?  Bf assured me that it wasn't that serious yet, but we still had to figure out what to do with him during the day.  Obviously he didn't have complete control of his body, and the earliest someone could be home was 3:30pm.  So we rigged somewhat of a doghouse using the shed and left him in the backyard.  He seems OK now, but we haven't fed him yet tonight and don't plan to.  I guess - just like with humans - there's a wide variety of reasons a dog might get diarrhea, so unless it's persistent, or he seems lethargic and in pain, there's really not much for us to do.  I think I read today that we could give him immodium or pepto, but I only use that on myself in the direst of circumstances.  Is this all just part-n-parcel of having a puppy?  Anyways, I think I want a shower and an early night.  In the hopes that maybe tomorrow I won't feel like crying again.

        Update on Conspiracy Theory    I offer one more piece of evidence to back up this theory -    urlLink More than 1500 head of cattle have been destroyed . . . To date, all test results have been negative."    And they'll continue to slaughter more, but they'll never discover the origin of this lone diseased animal.  Why?   Because you can't find the origin of an animal that's been planted!!   Duh, people.

        The Lighter Side of Things    On the brighter side . . . we signed our mortgage papers yesterday evening.  Some scary numbers, I tell ya.  We only have a 3 year term, and yet we'll be paying about $32K into it, but nearly $22K of that is strictly interest.  Our principal will only go down by about $10K.  Then again, over 3 years, we'd probably end up paying over $30K in rent, and NONE of that would be equity.  And we'll be in the house for nearly 2 months before we have to make a mortgage payment.  So I'm happy. =)  4 weeks and one day til we move now.  Not long at all.  And Monday marks the start of my career as I would have liked it to start a year ago.  Better late than never, I believe. =)  I'm getting excited about it now.  I'm looking forward to hopefully challenging my brain a little more.  And perfect timing, too - summer has got to be the best time of year to be downtown.  Lunchtime walks, people everywhere, and so many shops . . . I can't wait!  Rascal gave us a bit of a scare today.  We came back from looking at the house to find our upstairs neighbour outside with our puppy wrapped in a blanket.  It turns out she'd heard a horrible sound from the yard like he was being tortured.  She raced out to find her dog on one end of the pen (it's a good 15m long, if not 20m), and Rascal on the other.  They've played together on numerous occasions without incident.  And Rascal was bleeding profusely from his nose.  But like a nosebleed, not like he'd been bitten or anything.  He had a lump on the side of his nose, but no punctures.  He seems OK now, and the bump has gone down somewhat.  But I guess we'll never know what happened.  We think maybe he got bitten by a bug, and in his surprise, perhaps hit is nose hard on the fence or side of the house.  Or maybe in tousling, he whacked it.  I hope it was nothing serious.  It's very scary to come home to find blood all over the back yard and your upstairs neighbour!  I'm so very grateful that she was around.

      Wow, the response to that post was better than I thought.  It's just something I've been thinking about lately.  I've been thinking a lot about relationships - not necessarily romantic ones, but in general.  Perhaps the majority of my problems lie in my naivete - it makes me awfully vulnerable to disappointment.  I won't divulge the specific one that's been nagging at me lately, but I actually had another example of it today.  I thought I was on pretty friendly terms with most of the women I work with.  OK, at least one doesn't fit into that category, but the rest seemed pretty OK with me.  I talked with them about my pet woes when the puppy first arrived, my excitement over the new house, and most recently my new job.  I've written about the stress I felt over leaving my current position, and how I felt I did the best I could given the circumstances.  By the way, Biskette is doing awesome, and I think she'll do just fine.  But apparently there's been some unrest among the 'harem' at work.  She still hasn't been given a firm 'yes, this position is yours', and I've gotten uneasy vibes from my supervisor.  It turns out a few of the women have complained to the general manager over how much she's getting paid and the fact that she doesn't have a technical diploma.  And the fact that they feel she 'got in through the back door'.  For one, almost the entire parent company is comprised of people who are related to the owners/managers, or know someone related to them.  And maybe half of them are actually capable of the jobs they've been given.  Second, my friend doesn't even have an offer of employment yet, much less an established salary.  The woman before me had no related education, or even post-secondary education to speak of, and she was making more than even I am now.  The position was advertised at $1000/mo less than this, and I had just assumed that's what they might give her.  I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that things could get that petty - half-jokingly, we (as in, us women) were constantly griping about ineptitude around the office and complaining about others behind their backs.  Disappointment is what I felt when I heard this.  It makes me wonder what was/is probably being said about me when I'm not around.  I think I need to learn to shut my mouth a little more often, and not get so friendly with the people I work with.  How many times have I learned this lesson, and it never sticks??  I hope I can remember it this time around with the new job.  I made an actual good friend at one job, and they fire me over it.  I only  think  I have friends at another job, and it still gets me in trouble.  I keep to myself, try to keep things professional instead of personal, and I'm perceived as a snob - cold, too good to associate with my co-workers.  There doesn't seem to be a middle ground.  Anyways.

        Your Turn     Instead of posting something personal today, I thought I might poll the few people who might still read here.  I wonder:  What is it exactly that makes you consider someone a friend?  And what distinguishes "just" a friend from a "best" friend?

There just doesn't seem to be time for both.  I just wanted to let you all know I'm still alive . . . and now I must tend to the warm kitty on my lap who has rather ungraciously demanded attention twice now.  Oh, and the warm man on the couch that I've hardly talked to yet today, much less cuddled with . . . =)~

I don't think I'm particularly hard-done-by, I just want to complain in some form so I can get it out of my system and put it in perspective and move on.  And it works, for me at least. =)  And DaGoddess, if you stop by, I really hope you get some good news about your son!

        Third Time?  Time To Give Up!     Ever the optimist . . .   It's time to give up on the idea of having a new washer and dryer set, at least for another year.  Yes, I thought I'd decided that we were going to take the less stressful road of buying a used set, but then we had to fill some time last night while the clothes were drying at the laundromat, and we still hadn't made any progress in the used direction, so I figured we'd make one last attempt at the "new" route.  First stop - The Brick.  Slightly overpriced, so we left pretty quickly.  Next stop - Leon's.  We found the same model $100 cheaper than the Brick, so figured 'what the heck, might as well see if we can qualify'.  Filled out the application, and the guy even came back and started asking us which payment plan we wanted, when we wanted delivery . . . so I thought that meant it was in the bag.  I was so relieved and excited . . . and then, as he was looking up delivery availability, he got paged, and the news wasn't good.  Same story as before - it's not that you have bad credit, it's that you have too much, and even if you don't owe anything, credit companies still see a $1000 or $3000 card as being $1000 or $3000 of debt, because you can still use it, blahblahblahblahblah . . .   We left extremely disappointed and resigned that this was just not meant to be.  So, it looks like I'm in for at least another week or two of laundromat trips.  It's really not all that bad, except for feeling guilty about having to leave the dog alone for yet another 2 hours.

        "Hindsight is 20/20"     I've had a lot of this lately.  Looking back on things - some that are reversible (to an extent) and other that aren't - and realizing that there was a better path.  For one, getting a puppy . . . at the time, I thought it would be best to wait until we were in the house, and settled into that change.  But I got caught up in the excitement, and it drown out my rational self.  Unfortunately, this is one of the somewhat reversible things.  Two, changing jobs before we moved.  This was just one of those 'deal with it' things, and it's just how things worked out, but it probably would have been a lot less stressful if I'd stuck with my old job for a little longer.  Three, buying a house as soon as we did.  My bf and I were actually talking about this just last night.  It's rather uncanny how we often have the same thoughts, but don't realize it until one of us voices it.  But he mentioned that we might be better off right now if we'd simply rented a bigger place for 6 mos-1 year and paid off all our debt, and  then  gone for the house.  It was uncanny, because I'd been thinking the same thing earlier in the day.  But that's just one of those things you chalk up to a learning experience, and deal with it.  Four, holding out for $3300 for my stupid car when a guy was willing to pay me $3000 for it.  I have to not think of this one much, because it's one of those things that makes me want to kick my own ass for being so optimistic (really, greedy might be a better word).  If only I'd known what I was in for . . .   OK, so now this is degrading into a list of regrets, which wasn't the purpose when I started.  Because those first three, I don't regret.  It's just that things might be different (easier?) right now if I'd/we'd chosen differently.  But things happen the way they happen for a reason, and I've always maintained that they happen for an ultimate good.  I'm having trouble applying that one to the puppy situation, but sometimes it takes a while for the good to become apparent.

        Sad Days     I wasn't even sure I wanted to post about this, because people I know in the flesh read my blog and I'm not sure I want to feel judged.  But people would find out eventually, anyways.  We've had to make a tough decision.  Things aren't improving with Rascal, and it's getting to the point that we're worried he'll grow into a disobedient dog if we keep him much longer.  He's not a bad dog, but he definitely needs more attention and more training than we can offer him.  And the situation isn't likely to change anytime in the near future.  I don't believe that Rascal is happy, and I don't think we are, either.  So today I have to make the awful phone call to the rescue agency we got him from, and admit that we failed.  We made a decision that we ultimately couldn't commit to, and it feels awful.  The part I'm dreading most?  The looks and comments we're likely to get from our friends when they find out.  My bf thinks that they'll be too pre-occupied with their pregnancies, and that one couple will have to get rid of their own dog, but I'm not so sure.  I've been on the receiving end of one or two cutting remarks before, after I gave one of my cats back to my ex . . . as in "you shouldn't be allowed to get a kitten, because you already gave up one of your cats" . . . And I'm worried that we'll be black-listed for years at the agency.  *sigh*  Guess we'll be cat people for at least the next couple of years.

        That Evil Green-Eyed Monster     What is it, exactly, that causes us to be irrationally jealous?  Even when our logical selves tell us there shouldn't be any reason for it?  I don't  think  I'm a jealous person for the most part.  I may get mildly insecure in some situations, but nothing severe enough that I'd call it jealousy.  But there's one person who causes this irrational jealous in me, and it bothers me.  It's the younger sister (not quite 18 yet) of a girl my bf dated 'way-back-when'.  Now, I've met and hung out with this ex (and he's got lots of them from his younger years, but not serious exes), and I quite like her.  She's a nice girl, easy to get along with, and I have no beef with her.  I mean really - if I got insecure at every ex he's had, this relationship wouldn't have lasted more than a couple of weeks.  But her sister is a different story.  The first time I met her, she was just barely 16, and it was a backyard BBQ that my bf was hosting.  She rubbed me the wrong way from the moment she arrived.  She was a whiney attention-seeker, and spent the night playing games with my bf and another guy who was there.  Plus, she was drinking, which I'm sure only made it worse.  She'd disappear into the house (while everyone else was outside around the fire), my bf and J would go off in search of her, and she'd put up this dramatic scene/adolescent tantrum as they carried her back up to 'join the party.'  Now, in my bf's defense, he'd promised her older sister that he'd watch out for her and make sure she had a good time.  And he'd been drinking - deep down he's a sweet and caring man, but he puts on a tough macho act most of the time, but when he's been drinking, this softer side sometimes comes out.  So he thought he was just trying to make sure she had a good time.  Those of us who were a little more sober and detached from the situation saw differently.  She thought it was a game.  Well, fine, whatever - I felt neglected by him, mentioned it, and he said to be more forward if I was feeling left out, and to walk over and tell him so.  Unfortunately, that's not exactly my style, so I stewed most of the night.  As the night wore on, the party split up between the upstairs (this was when we had close friends living upstairs) and downstairs . . . I went upstairs to visit for a while, as I wasn't interested in the movie being watched downstairs.  When I finally did go down, what I saw wasn't entirely suspicious, but I lost it.  They were sharing the love seat, she had her feet on his lap, and they were both under a sleeping bag.  My logical self said "Hey, she's like a little sister or something, there's nothing to get riled about here."  But I still lost it.  This was about a year and a half ago.  More recently, she was one of the few people who showed up the day after we moved in to the house.  At first, it just never dawned on me . . . I knew who the older sister was, I knew she'd brought her younger sister with her, but my mind never connected it to the previous incident.  Lucky for both of us, I guess.  Even so, the moment I saw her, I got this irritated feeling that I couldn't pinpoint.  But I forced myself to be sociable, and we all went out to a pub for a couple of drinks, and she only irritated me more.  I just chalked it down to her age (not yet 18) and mentality (high school).  It wasn't until about the last half hour that we were hanging out that I clued in . . .   And then the other night, we were just about to go to bed, so I was standing beside the computer chair as my bf sent an email.  I wasn't even focussing on the screen, really, because I don't feel a need to be nosy or anything.  But then he somewhat awkwardly says, "That's so-and-so." (the younger sister)  "Huh?"  So I look at the email address - "superhotsexychick" or some such thing - and I can understand why he might have felt compelled to tell me who it was.  And I was hit by that jealousy again.  And once again, it bothered me.  Because I can't think of any good reason that this should bother me.  It hasn't crossed my mind that he's cheating on me, because I know he's not.  Especially not with someone so young.  But I think I'm bothered because I have no idea what her intentions are.  And she irritates the hell out of me, and she has a way of commanding his attention when she's around, and I feel belittled by it.  I've tried to put myself in his shoes, or liken it to a reversed situation, but it's not working.  All I can think is, "Thank God we don't see much of her."  Has anyone else who's normally not a jealous person had one person in particular who inspires an irrational bout of jealousy in them?

        It's Gone!!!  It's Gone!!!!     This has been a most excellent weekend, for several reasons, but one very ginormous one -    THE DODGE HAS BEEN SOLD!   That frickin' malignant tumour that has been plaguing me for nearly 9 months now, is finally gone.  I hope it was the auction house owner that bought it.  I got a bid 4 weeks ago (first weekend it was there) for $200.  He tried to convince me that the most I could expect for it was $300-$400.  I said I'd stick with my reserve at the time ($1500), figuring at the very least, I could sell it for parts for more than $200.  Then, last week I finally dropped the reserve to $1000, and got a call this Saturday, saying there was a bid of $700 on it.  I was ecstatic, but asked if they'd take $800 - I had decided that was the lowest I wanted to go - but gave him strict instructions to call me back (I wouldn't lose a sale over $100).  Not 5 mins later, he called back and said they'd take it.  I hung up and screamed.  Scared my bf, since he was driving at the time.  That is one huge, enormous weight lifted from the back of my mind.  It's a significant amount of money that can help pay down a credit card or two, and it's no longer my problem.  And another good little bit of news - about an hour after selling my Dodge, my bf got a call about his.  Of course, he's selling a Dodge/Chrylser Daytona Shelby, which is actually a good little sports car, and the only reason he's selling it is so he can get a new engine for his '79 GMC truck, which he sorely misses.  The guy seems pretty interested, and hopefully he calls back today (he came out to see it last night).  Some other good things about this weekend - we checked out pricing for a deck, and it's less than we'd thought; we decided to go with a used washer/dryer, and be done with it; we got our CMB (community mail box) finally; Rascal got bathed and doesn't smell bad anymore; we got to go shopping for a tent for this coming weekend; we went for ice cream at My Favorite Ice Cream Shop on Sunday afternoon . . . you can't beat a double-scoop ice cream cone on a hot summer afternoon.  Now I've just gotta get through the week, and we get to go camping!  I'm excited about that!

        "The FatBoy, The FatBoy!!!"     I'm so disappointed . . .   One of our local radio station (THE only good one! *L*), CJay 92, has this Rock Rewards program whereby you listen to the radio and they'll announce special passwords 4 times a day.  You enter them on their website, and they collect, like Air Miles.  And you can cash them for a variety of prizes - one being an entry into a "showcases" draw.  They'll offer these "showcases" for a couple of months, and then draw a winner.  The winner gets to choose one prize out of 6.  They did a draw this morning, and the prizes were as follows -   - His and hers fully loaded Cavaliers - $30,000 free rent from Boardwalk (obviously you have to live at one of their properties) - a golf package, including an equity membership at a course and a shopping spree - two mountain bikes and a mountain-biking vacation package - a $30,000 downpayment on a Beattie home -  A 2003 100th ANNIVERSARY HARLEY DAVIDSON FATBOY!   Can you believe the lady who won took the cars over the Harley?  (Oops - ammendment here - I guess she chose the Beattie home prize later).  My bf is going to be so disappointed when I tell him he didn't win, and even more disappointed when I told him the winner didn't even take the Fat Boy. *sigh*

        West Nile Hype     You can't go a day now without hearing some reference to the West Nile virus on the radio, or TV.  I'll admit - due to ignorance, I had begun to believe that this was a serious issue.  We ran out and bought a big can of Deep Woods Off (which we needed anyhow), all the time looking for the highest DEET concentration.  Then I was in Co-op yesterday, and read a few little tidbits about the virus.  Even where the West Nile virus is present, only approx. 1% of the mosquito population actual carries the disease.  And out of the people who are actually bitten by those mosquitoes, only 1% develop serious symptoms.  The other 99% might develop very mild ones (similar to a cold/flu, I believe) and then recover without even knowing they'd been infected.  There's good reason to cover up and use bug spray - mosquitoes are damn annoying, and a mosquito bite is even more annoying.  But I'm not going to get paranoid over getting bitten more so than any other summer.

        A Lesson In Bathroom Etiquette (for Men)    I don't claim to be an expert in this area, but I'll share with you what I've learned from observing my boyfriend (mainly) and various other men.  1.  Flushing is optional.  If you made an especially impressive deposit, feel free to leave it for the next occupant to admire.  2.  A quick wipe on the pants/shorts/shirt is sufficient - why waste water?  3.  Anyone within earshot is dying for a status report - ie. "Phew, I think I'm 5lbs lighter!" or "Wow, I think that was a triple-coiler!" (see #1.)  4.  Warnings are for wimps - dry your eyes and stifle your gagging as best as possible when you leave so as not to raise suspicion on the next victim until it's too late.  4a.  If caught, passing the blame is also for wimps - a real man takes pride in his bodily functions!  5.  More than 2 shakes and you're playing with yourself.  6.  A half-bathroom right next to the front door is perfect after eating a super-sized MacDonald's meal right before you expect company to show up.  7.  Closing the door is optional if you're standing up.  Guys - did I miss any?

        A Lesson In Bathroom Etiquette     Maybe I'm imagining things, but there seems to be an unspoken etiquette among women when it comes to communal washrooms.  Especially in the workplace, where you see the same people on a regular basis, but may not be particularly close to.  So for the few who may be ignorant of these rules, I thought I'd write them out.  1.  ALWAYS FLUSH.  There is nothing worse than a chance encounter with a yellow bowl full of floaters.  1a.  ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS.  I think this should go without saying.  2.  If there is a wall between you, do not start a conversation.   Of course, if you're close friends, and the convo started before you reached the loo, that's OK.  But don't initiate a conversation from either side of the stall, and especially not between stalls (the exception being if you're out of paper).  3.  If you walk in to a small multiple-stall washroom, and one is occupied by someone being incredibly quiet, do your business and leave as quickly as possible.   Most women I know prefer to do anything potentially noxious or noisy in complete privacy.  If someone is being oddly quiet, chances are they are waiting for some privacy to resume their business.  And if it so happens that you have gone in for that very reason, hold it if you can and return in about 15 mins.  The first person there has priority.  Of course, if you're so inclined, you can always initiate a competition to see who will wait the longest. =)  4.  In a 3-stall row, where all the stalls are empty, DO NOT choose the middle one.  Unless of course someone has forgotten #1 in both end stalls.   This is just plain ignorance - it's like sitting in the middle of a 3-seat row at the doctor's office.  It's common courtesy.  5.  Coughing is an acceptable means of attempting to disguise a much-needed fart (or telltale wrapper crinkle, if you're the painfully self-conscious sort).  We all know what you're trying to do, but we appreciate the effort nonetheless.  6.  Closing the door is never an option.  These rules are essential in order to reinforce the stereotype that ladies are clean and attractive beings who never make rude noises or bad smells.  And hey, if you know of any others, feel free to share them!

        Don't Worry, Be Happy, Mon     Like I've discovered so many times before - it's amazing what a day, and a better nights' sleep can do to my mood.  I've decided that so long as the bills get paid, and we can buy groceries, and still enjoy the odd little luxury or night out, things will take care of themselves.  They always have.  We're both fairly new at both our jobs - promotions and raises will eventually happen, and things will get better.  There will  never  be enough money for all the things we want, and that is just life.  And part of that is learning to decide what is worth splurging on, and what really doesn't matter.  And another part of that is resigning myself to another year or so of our current lifestyle - sacrificing toys and trips for the sake of paying down debt and getting some savings started.  I think the catch phrase is "living within ones' means".  There's just no point stressing out about it, and becoming a crabby-stingey-miserable-selfish person over it, because it won't change anything.  I firmly believe that all things happen for a reason, and for an ultimate good.  Perhaps our most recent experiences were meant to drive home the reality that we can't keep spending money and getting credit without paying it back at some point.  So that we  can  eventually enjoy our income as we please instead of constantly wasting it on interest accrued for things enjoyed 5 years ago.  "It's all Zen, man . . . " (OK, don't ask where that came from)  And now, time for some more sun, cool drinks, and trashy lunchtime Cosmo reads. =)

        I Need To Complain    I figured I might as well be upfront - the sole purpose of this post is so I can complain.  This new house has held a few more surprises than I had counted on.  But then again, if I had planned for something, it's not exactly a surprise, is it? =)  The biggest thing right now is laundry . . . we had been told by friends - months ago - not to bother buying a washer and dryer because they'd be replacing their set.  The practical and sceptical side of me told the bf that things would be much simpler if we simply bought a washer and dryer along with the rest of the appliances.  Then, they'd be included with the price of the house, and thus included in the mortgage.  Then, if said friends later decided they couldn't afford a new set, or some such thing, we weren't left in a lurch.  But the bf talked me out of it - 'why pay for something we can get for free?'    Yet another occasion where I should have listened to that inner voice.  Now, nearly 3 weeks after moving in, we have had to resort to doing laundry at the laundromat.  Silly me - I had been leaving it up to the bf to ask his friend about it.  Guys just aren't much for remembering these kinds of things.  So I was out with the female half of the couple two weeks ago, and I decided to ask her once and for all.  Turns out she had been prodding her husband for weeks to mention to my bf that the dryer was on the fritz and they didn't want to give us a broken dryer.  And of course, like my bf, he had simply forgotten.  At the time, I figured 'no big deal' - Sleep Country had eagerly offered us an interest-free financing option, surely we'd qualify for the same at an appliance store?  And failing that, surely the bank would let us open a line of credit?  Ha - just goes to show how naive I still am.  I'm convinced it was botched somehow (the salesguy left my bf's name on the app when he put my info through), but we were turned down for a Sears Card.  And  apparently  lines of credit are very hard to get.  Even though the guy who took our application was very optimistic.  He ended up submitting an incomplete application (of course, I don't find this out until AFTER), which they construed as deliberate lying on my part.  Of course, they always give several reasons when you get declined.  I was rather angry when I found this out - I intend to call back today and give them a piece of my mind.  So - we're back at square one.  Now we have to figure out which of 3 options is going to be least stressful.  We could keep going to the laundromat indefinitely, but that's a huge inconvenience.  We could look around for a used set, but I'm paranoid about anything that is mechanic and used (especially after the car).  Plus, we'd have to come up with the cash right away, and a used set would probably add a fair amount to our utility bills.  Or, we could use an alternate funding source to get the new set we'd planned on, which wouldn't add as much to the bills, but would probably take a year to pay off.  Or, I suppose we could come up with some sort of combination of the above.  I'm tired of making so many 'responsible' decisions.  I miss feeling young and (relatively) carefree.  Maybe we weren't ready for the house after all.  So now I'm eagerly volunteering for extra work at my old job, in the hopes that I can earn enough to pay straight up for a new set.  I don't know if that will happen, though.  I   hate   worrying about money.  It makes me a crabby, stingey, miserable and selfish person.

        To Blog . . . or to Jog    Well, OK, if I wasn't blogging, I wouldn't exactly be jogging.  More like moseying around.  But still.  I'm aiming for a little of both.  I feel very guilty lately.  As I've mentioned before, we got a puppy a little while ago.  My bf is a dog person, and this has only confirmed that I am definitely not.  Even so, I'm feeling very guilty lately.  Between moving, working extra for my old job, longer hours at the new job, and my bf having longer summer hours, Rascal has been sadly neglected.  Given his age and breed mix, he definitely needs more attention and exercise than we've been able to give him in past weeks.  Sadly, this causes a chain reaction - he has all this pent-up energy, and starts misbehaving.  Then, I get frustrated with him, and either make my bf deal with him, or I'll just get very mad at him.  So I feel guilty for two reasons - the dog is alone and in his kennel far too much, and he probably thinks I'm a miserable bitch.  Hmm, some days, that's not far from the truth. =)  We'd talked about possibly giving him back, but even being a non-dog person, I've had a really hard time making any decisions in that direction.  I talk to some people (mainly, other dog owners), and they're often encouraging . . . he'll be less active as an adult, and things will get better.  That we shouldn't be too hard on ourselves, we're human.  Basically that our situation is temporary.  And others feel that if I'm/we're stressed out by it, by all means, eliminate the stress.  Coincidentally, these have been the non-dog owners.  After thinking about it for nearly 2 weeks now, and having had things settle down somewhat, I think things would have to get really bad before we'd be able to decide to give him up.  I mean he'd have to destroy things around the house (which he thankfully hasn't shown any tendency towards), and be completely unmanageable.  I think we just need to give it a few more weeks for things to settle down, and register him again for training classes (we had to cancel out - there just wasn't enough time).  Sheesh - all my friends are having babies, and we can barely manage a dog! *L*

        By Golly Gee Whiz . . .      Guess who's pregnant now?  Yuppers - the other couple we tend to hang out with.  Not even 6 weeks along, and she's eagerly announcing her news.    Hmmmm, less than 2 months apart . . . who called that one?  Personally, this one disturbs me somewhat - they're only 21/22, bought a house, aren't married, yet were trying their darndest (OK, I think SHE was trying her darndest) for this.  That picture just isn't right to me.  If I ever get pregnant, I'll probably be the one who doesn't even suspect something until 2 months have gone by, and even then, I probably won't bother telling anyone (except maybe respective mothers) until I started to show.

        My Get-Rich Scheme     I came up with a get-rich-quick scheme last night - I'm going to find the switch that stops time.  But I know for a fact it has a timer on it, so nobody can switch time off indefinitely.  Which is good - no one wants to be suspended forever.  But not like they'd know or anything . . .   You know what I'd do if I found that switch?  I'd turn time off for a few days, so I could get all sorts of stuff done, and then one day extra so I could do nothing.  Yes, this is a common theme in my life lately - there just aren't enough hours in a day for my liking.  I need more hours for getting stuff done, and I need more hours for sleep.  *sigh*  Good thing Friday is just around the corner.

       Moving    So it all began on Friday morning.  The bf went off to work, and I headed to the north side of the city to pick up our keys.  It took all of 10 minutes, so I was on my way again sooner than I'd thought.  "Awesome, maybe things'll go a lot smoother than I'd hoped today!"  Haha.  So after picking up the one set, I still needed to get a second set from the contractor foreman at the new house.  So, despite my tummy rumblings by now, I headed back south to pick up the second set.  Unfortunately, I got to the house, went in, waited a little, and still no Neil.  Darn.  Well, I wasn't going to wait around all day - I figured I'd be making a few trips back with small carloads of stuff, and would probably run into him at some point throughout the day.  (As a note, we STILL don't have that second set of keys!)  Despite having a full day planned, I thought it would be time well spent if I got a hearty breakfast as opposed to something quick. Mmmm, Denny's.  Nothing beats eggs, sausages, toast and hash browns when you need a long days' worth of energy. =)  Even after breakfast, I was surprised by how slowly time was going by.  "This is great!"  Next up was a little shopping.  I had planned to get a few small things - bathroom items and a bed set, mainly.  So we wouldn't be scrambling at the last minute, or have to run out the next day when we needed to be unpacking.  Spent only about 2 hours at the mall and in various stores, but came out surprisingly empty-handed.  No luck on the bed set - I'm just too darn picky.  Around this time, I'm trying to arrange for some last-minute help so I can start moving stuff before my bf arrived home from work.  There was still a fair amount left to be packed, and I figured a little help might not hurt.  Meanwhile, I get a phone call from the bf saying he was on his way to pick up the truck and trailer!  I hadn't expected to hear from him for at least another 4 hours.  So change in plans - head home and start packing the last of the stuff so we can start loading.  We were on our own for a good hour and a half, and it was slow going with only 2 people.  Around 3:30, my brothers and mum finally showed up, and by the time 5:30 rolled around and everyone else was finally off work, we had the trailer fully packed and ready to go.  Since my mum had already left, and one brother needed to be home too, I figured I'd drive him home and pick up food on my way back.  It was just after 6:30pm.  We took a swing by the new house (he was stopping by later to pick up the other brother), and I drove him home.  By the time I headed back, ordered pizza for everyone, picked up a sandwich for myself (I was feeling ill at this point, and the thought of pizza only made it worse), went back and waited far too long for the pizza, and finally arrived back at the new house, it was 9pm.  I couldn't believe how late it was.  I was dead dog tired, achy from working hard and then sitting in a car for 2.5 hours, and feeling ill from hunger and exhaustion to boot.  A sandwich and couple of beers later, I was feeling a little perkier, only to have the bulk of our friends leave.  No big deal, I guess - they'd be back for the house warming the next day.  I was a little disappointed though - I'd spend the entire evening driving around, and hadn't been able to help unpack or set things up.  I felt a little left out.  The next day, I woke up exhausted.  Not a good thing.  Construction started across the street around 7:30, there were no blinds, and it was a restless night.  We had to be up fairly early - Shaw was scheduled to come between 10-12 to hook up the internet, and Sleep Country was coming between 11-2pm to deliver the bed.  While the bf stayed behind again, I went out for some breakfast and to fetch all our shower stuff from the old place (we were both depressed from feeling so dirty).  It took me 2 hours to run such piddly errands.  Frustration.  I get back, and we eat, and luckily Shaw and Sleep Country come within about an hour of each other.  So we're free to go out and get a few more things for the house, fetch more stuff from the old place, and start unpacking some more.  By the time 6pm rolled around - when the house warming was supposed to unofficially begin - I was NOT in the mood for company.  Now, we'd invited hoards of people.  Or so we thought.  Our "closest" friends (I say that with a touch of bitterness and sarcasm) claimed we'd never told them about it, and the one driver was already drunk, so . . . . they never showed up.  Fine, whatever.  One good friend showed up, and a few people I hardly knew.  A little later, our friends from down the street came by.  I was so frazzled from the hectic day that I completely forgot that I told at least one person that I'd call her and let her know when to come.  And later, it turns out that most of the people my bf works with had heard about the party, but hadn't been told personally, so they weren't sure they were invited.  Sheesh. =)  So, I guess we'll be having an official house warming a little later on.  That's fine with me.  It gives us a chance to fix up the house how we like it, get rid of all the boxes, and maybe even start some of the finishing touches (bench for the porch, a dog pen, maybe even a deck).  And officially invite people instead of giving out verbal blanket invitations. =)  Egads, it's 1:15pm already . . . I'll have to continue this later.  Well, Sunday was finally a bit of rest and more unpacking and a little shopping, so that's not exactly interesting.

        STOP!     Wait for me!  I need to catch up!  That's what I want to do this week.  I've commented at least a few times that, had I taken a whole week off after moving, I wouldn't have been bored for one minute.  Even without having any TV hookup.  And now that I'm back at work, I realize I probably could have taken the whole week off without much incidence - with it being Stampede, hardly anybody is working anyways.  Oh well.  C'est la vie.  You know, initially, I thought this move would be much like any other - it's a change, but eventually things fall into the same rhythm as before.  I don't think that's going to be the case this time.  There's just something different about moving into a home, and being a homeowner.  It changes you.  I have a new level of pride in where I live.  I want everything to have its place, and I want things set up to reflect us.  I don't want it to be overwhelmingly "his" or "hers".  And I've seen both.  As much as I didn't think this change would be a big impact on our relationship, it's becoming obvious that it will.  But I don't think it will be a bad thing, and I think we'll be fine.  It has been stressful with the dog, though.  We don't want him soiling the brand new carpet, but he has to be closely supervised outside.  We don't have a penned area for him to roam, and his whining echoes throughout the neighbourhood because the houses are still sparse.  Oh well, I know we'll all eventually adjust.

        One More Sleep . . .      And plenty of work left!  Here I am, on my day off, cramming in a couple of minutes of down time.  It's been crazy.  The lawyer's office finally got a hold of me this morning, and told me both of us had to go in, and it had to be this afternoon.  I was not impressed - my bf was already at work and I didn't know if he'd be able to get time off.  But we made it all the same.  All the i's have been dotted and the t's crossed . . . as far as financing and legal matters, we're all set for tomorrow.  In other matters, we're far from ready!  Today has breezed by, and it feels like I haven't done anything productive yet.  But I have, in a way.  I decided that a day off was a perfect time to finally get some routine bloodwork done.  The darn sheet from the doctor's office has been sitting in my car since February!  But I tried to go on a Saturday once, and the lab is just insanely busy on a Saturday.  And there's really no other good time, when you have to fast for at least 10 hours, no more than 16.  So I went this morning.  Icky needles . . . but at least the nurse was really good - she had to change tubes 3 times, and the needle didn't jiggle once.  So after that, I headed back home, picked up the post-it with our final amount owing, and headed to the bank to get a certified cheque.  Picked up some breakfast from good ol' Timmy's after (by then it was after 11pm and I hadn't eaten), and took one last boo at the house, since I was in the area.  All told, I got home just after noon, and had to leave again at 12:30 to make it downtown for our lawyer's appointment.  And now I'm finally back home, and just waiting a little while for my mum to get here.  She's gonna follow me up to the auction place so I can drop off my Dodge.  Yes, I still have that frickin thing.  This is my second-to-last resort.  Final resort is selling it for it's value in scrap metal, and maybe the tires.  I'm really hoping it sells this weekend - they're having a Stampede breakfast, which always brings crowds.  And then when I finally get back, hopefully I can start the last of the packing.  Even though there are boxes everywhere, it still seems like there's lots left to do.  And the place is a mess.  I have to try to block that out (a messy house stresses me out), because there's no point cleaning it until we've moved out.  I can't wait until we're moved and unpacked.  Tomorrow's going to be my shopping day (assuming everything else gets done today).  I pick up the keys at 8:30, and then I'll open up the house, take one last set of pictures before we move in, and go buy a few things.  I'm so excited.  And then on Saturday, we'll be having our housewarming party.  It'll be insane if everyone we've invited shows up!  I'm kinda hoping they do, but in shifts . . . like one set of people shows up late afternoon, another early evening, and another a little later.  Guess we'll see what happens . . .   I'm   so   excited.  And Sunday we'll probably be recouperating.  I'm not going to want to go to work on Monday . . . I'll just want to sit around the house and soak it all in!  Oh well, can't pay for the house if we're not working! =)  So that's about all that's on my mind right now.  Well, that and the fact that Rascal has turned into a very hyper and challenging adolescent.  And unfortunately, we haven't been able to walk him as much as we'd like lately with all the moving hullaballoo.  But we've got ourselves signed up for basic training classes that start soon, so I'm hoping that helps somewhat.  We need to learn some new ways to remind him of his place in the household, and also constructive ways for him to use all his energy!  That said, I'm off for now . . .

       I don't think I'll ever have a need for a dream interpreter.   The few dreams that I remember upon waking are often so transparent, it's like a teacher who over-enunciates to her kindergarten students.  I woke up from one this morning that almost had me in tears.  I had to hit snooze one extra time in an attempt to dull it's effect on me before starting my day.  My mum had organized a birthday party for me, complete with a rather large group of guests.  I got dropped off by a friend of my bf's, but once I got out of the vehicle, I was either inappropriately dressed or nearly naked (I can't remember which).  Whichever it was, it gave me this overwhelming feeling that I had to go home and shower and change before I could face all those people in my mum's house, especially since they were all there for me.  My house (in the dream) was not all that far away, but just far enough that walking would take a good deal of time.  And seeing as I got dropped off, my car wasn't handy to just drive myself there and back.  I was hiding out around the side of the house as I watched the guests arrive.  I was quite annoyed when I noticed that my bf had arrived with the same friend who had dropped me off earlier - I had figured he would drive my car, and then I could race home and change and race back.  As I was debating what to do next, I could hear them all starting to celebrate inside the house, as if they couldn't be bothered to wait for me any longer - or worse, that the party wasn't for me in the first place (even though it was my birthday, in the dream).  I finally just started walking home, feeling angry, invisible and worthless.  I hadn't heard anybody ask once "Where's Ang?"  And once I got home, do you know who I found there?  My boyfriend, all concerned and asking where on earth I'd been, how come I wasn't at the party.  He was the only one who cared enough to go looking for me.  Some of the elements are pretty mundane - I get very frustrated when I don't have a vehicle at my disposal, because I hate being dependent on other people, especially for getting places.  And tomorrow, my car is booked in for a servicing that's supposed to take 2 hours, and the only hair appointment I could get overlaps it.  I've been passively mulling all week on how I'm going to get there.  But the other is definitely an echo of feelings I've been trying to gloss over lately.  I've been bitter whenever I'm reminded that most of my 'old' friends have nothing to do with me anymore.  I try to convince myself that I shouldn't be, that people change, and circumstances change, and so will friendships.  That those starting families have new priorities, and those who are single want to be spontaneous and party.  But I'm still bitter.  The one good part? - I don't question whether my boyfriend cares or not, because I know he does.  Yeah, no trouble interpreting  that  dream.

        He's Such A Card!    I love my youngest brother.  He has such a sense of humour.  You know how most people make their nicknames on messenger programs something cute or descriptive, like "sexyhotmama" or "The Duke"?  Well, my brother comes up with these wacky quips, and changes them every couple of days.  To give you an example, today's nickname is:    "John's Hopkins hospital purchases 150 Laz-Y-Boys for their operating rooms.  In related news, fatality rate has since risen 50%."    Although warped and sometimes dark, I love his sense of humour.  Actually, maybe that's WHY I like it.  I love my little brother. =)

        Yay!  Cable's Finally Back!    Grrrr . . . I'm getting fed up with the whole new neighbourhood thing.  Our cable - TV and internet - just up and disappeared last Friday.  They promised someone would be by in 48 hours or less to check all the externals, and then made an appointment for a week later for someone to look inside.  Well, they called last weekend and said everything had been fixed, but when I checked, we still had no cable.  So we waited patiently for our appointment this weekend, only to be told that it was external!  A small outage only affecting a few houses.  The bf was talking with our new next-door neighbours today, and found out from them that someone driving a heavy-equipment truck had actually flattened the outside box, but luckily everything is up and running today - obviously.  We're thinking of checking out satellite options.  And then just today, we were out running some errands and visiting people.  We came back to find my bf's Daytona about a car-length further down the street and the rear-end all smashed up.  Thank goodness the guy was upstanding enough to leave a note in the windshield.  My bf was more than willing to take a cash settlement, since he's selling it anyways, but within one phone call, the guy said he'd already informed his insurance company, so there's really no going back.  We FINALLY got the pop machine moved, so hopefully they finish filling in the backyard this week.  I'd sure like to be building a deck next weekend.  The park across the street is starting to take shape . . .   And the inquiries about marriage and kids just doesn't end . . . *sigh*  Oh well, guess I'll get used to it.  It has sparked a few more conversations between us on the subject though . . . =)

        When Life Hands You A Bunch Of Sour Grapes . . .        Betcha I have ya thinkin' I've got more griping to do, huh? =)  Not so!  You know, I was thinking earlier today that most of the time, it seems like I only write when I need to purge negative feelings or reactions.  More often than not, the happy moments just kind of slip by, enjoyed at the moment but never hashed to death during a ranting.  Actually, I think I heard it summed up best by a band's motto - "You don't need an outlet when you're happy."  Needless to say, their music is very anst-ridden, though great to listen to.  So this girl though she'd write for once about how happy she is.  And I am.  When I think back to all the times I said (or felt like saying) "you know, I'm really happy right now" . . . there have been an awful lot of them this year.  I recall telling someone earlier this year (at the risk of jinxing myself, even) that I was convinced this would be   my   year.  So yeah - I'm happy.  Life seems to be settling down at home - and in a very good way.  I'm starting to find room for fitness in my week, the house is starting to take shape, and I love going home to my boyfriend.  It's actually kinda funny (or I think so) . . . he could be gone just for a regular work day, and if I can see his work van parked outside the house on my way home, I get excited.  And if it isn't, I'm a little disappointed.  And when he does come home, and I hear the door open, I get excited.  Not little-kid-wild excited, but like a little internal "yay! he's home!"  Is that what love is like for everyone?  I love the little moments we have . . . just vegging on the porch with a beer, talking up a storm about the things we want to do next month, next year, in the next few years.  I think that's how - before there's marriage talk - you know that your man sees things in the long term.  Oui?  Non?  There are two basic types of questions I get asked these days - "So when are you guys getting married?" and "So, do you think you guys will end up married?" - and I take great offense to the first, and don't mind answering the second.  I was somewhat amused, but also put off, when my boyfriend's dad approached me when I was alone at the company BBQ last weekend.  He asked me 'where my husband was.'  This didn't phase me, as most of the people I associate with casually refer to any significant other - married or not - as a husband or wife.  I said that I had no clue and waved vaguely off in the field, knowing he was playing on the quads.  So his dad pauses, gets this half-soft-half-joking look on his face, and then starts tapping his watch, saying "So when are we going to do this, huh?  You know, I can always use with another daughter-in-law."  I laughed and said I had no clue, which is the honest truth.  At this point, it's not something I'm eager for, but should I get asked, of course my answer would be yes.  And I think my boyfriend knows this.  It's not something I want to pressure him into (or, inadvertently, away from).  Boy, I guess this is what I end up with when I start writing with no particular purpose in mind. =)  So, to encourage comments, I'd love to know about those of you who are or have been married - what was the proposal like, and were you expecting it?  And do you still get that "yay! he's home!" feeling? =)

        Don't You Just Love Strange Phone Calls?     It leaves you with something to gossip about for days! =)  I got one on Monday night.  A little background for you - I have 3 younger brothers; the 2 youngest (17 & 20) live with my mum, and the oldest (22) flits in and out of our lives as he pleases.  It's very rare that any one of us will know where he lives, where he's working, or what he's up to at any given moment.  In fact, it's very common for all of us to be pretty clueless.  Yes, it's sad, but it's how our family works.  So on Monday evening, I get a call from him.  It went something like this:   HIM:  Hi. (no mention of who he is - although I recognized his voice after a few seconds)  ME:  uhh, hi  HIM:  How are you?  ME:  uhhh, fine  *long pause*   HIM:  What's wrong?  ME:  uhhh, nothing (I was completely baffled at the possible reason for this call)  HIM:  I guess you're wondering why I'm calling you.  ME:  Well, yeah.  HIM:  I moved.  ME:  OK.  HIM:  To 14th Street.  ME:  OK.  HIM:  To a 2-bedroom.  ME:  OK. (still baffled)  HIM:  (getting sniffley) Dad suggested that I call you.  ME:  Oh really! (dripping with sarcasm)  And why did he say that?  *at this point, I'm extremely curious as to where this is going*   HIM:  Well . . . (getting quieter) . . . cuz I'm kinda strapped for cash for the next week and a half.  ME:  Well, sorry C, but you called the wrong person.  I just moved into a house.  HIM:  Oh . . . uh . . .(trailing off) well . . . *hang up*  Now, family members have bailed my oldest brother out in the past.  And I'm not opposed to helping out family members - goodness knows I've gotten my share in the past little while.  But he is notorious for being out of cash, and never learning from his mistakes, and never paying people back.  Even if I had a little extra to spare at the moment (which I obviously don't), I would pretty much have to consider it a donation, and not a loan.  I have yet to get in touch with my mum to see if she knows the story behind this, or if he's called her as well.  The intriguing part is that  my dad  told him to call me.  My dad and I have a non-existent relationship at the moment.  And he's obviously doing well for himself - I found out last night that he has a toll-free (1-800) number for himself.  Can't be that badly off.  Anyways . . . gotta love strange phone calls, especially from family members!

        My First Medical Condition!     I was excited to find out yesterday that I have my first medical condition - a  urlLink ganglion cyst .  At first, it was pretty disturbing . . . I just looked at my hand one day, and there's this bump on my wrist.  No idea where it came from or what it could be.  My very first thought was "broken bone", but I wasn't in any pain, so that was quickly dismissed.  Cancer didn't even really enter my mind, because it appeared so suddenly.  So I made a doctor's appointment.  At that point, I'd never even heard of the term "ganglion".  I was telling a friend about it, and she said her sister had had the same thing, and she called it a ganglia.  I wasn't sure how much of her story to believe - she said her doctor told her she could either bash it back in herself, or get surgery.  So yesterday, I did some research online before my doctor's appointment.  A ganglion fit the description to a tee.  It's actually kind of cool - for now, because it's not causing me any pain or restriction in motion.  I can gross some people out with it, too. =)  But there are basically 4 treatments - a) do nothing, b) as mentioned, bash it back in myself, c) have the doctor aspire it (meaning needle - yikes!), or d) surgery, if it ever gets bad enough.  They can come and go, and generally don't cause any problems.  So yeah, I have my first medical condition!  I thought I was past the stage of "firsts" for a while . . . =)

        Living With Your Decisions     It's only been a few days, but I find myself missing the things I used to consider hassles.  Walking in the door and hearing the "thudthudthudthud" of someone who was excited to see me.  Well, excited to see  somebody  at least.  And the same "thudthudthudthud" when one of us would finally come down the stairs in the morning.  Having the company when the bf works late, even if it meant I couldn't always do what I wanted.  I don't know that we made the right decision, but it's the decision we made and there's no turning back now.  It was even harder than I'd thought . . . several times during the afternoon, as I was driving about town and running errands, my eyes would well up as I thought about how things would be different.  When we were finally heading out of town, it didn't even faze me that he was drooling terribly - in fact, I was impressed that he didn't get carsick.  And then we got to Kim's house - the same lady we picked him up from 4 months earlier.  She was all sweet and wonderful to Rascal, but obviously pissed off at us.  This is what got to me most . . . there were so many times in that 5 minutes we were there that I just wanted to grab him away and say "Forget it, we'll find some other way" . . . I was trying not to get emotional, and she only made it worse.  I realize that I probably complained a lot about the dog . . . I still won't claim to be a dog person.  But Rascal had started to grow on me.  I know there would have been more problems down the road if we'd kept him, but damn I miss him now.  This isn't at all like when I had to give up one of my cats.  I knew he was unhappy where he was, and that he would be much happier with fewer cats and more people around, and I felt comfortable that that's what he got.  I never doubted my decision once after it was made.  But this is different.  I feel like we should have tried harder, done more, I feel like we gave up too easily.  I wish we'd taken him camping with us, had one more weekend together instead of feeling like we were dumping him on our way to more important things.  But then we definitely would have been more attached, and only made the decision harder to carry through.  But maybe that's what we should have done anyways.  Maybe if we'd seen what he could be like with a little more attention and company, we'd have decided differently.  *sigh*  I gotta stop this.  What's done is done and that's that.  I gotta live with my decisions and move on.  There's no saying that there won't ever be another dog.  And next time, we'll be good and ready for one, and we'll be able to give him/her the life they deserve.  Rascal, I'm going to get updates every couple of days to make sure that you really do end up somewhere better.  I hope you get lots of attention, and walks, and treats, and petting.  I hope you maybe even have a brother or sister to keep you company when your people leave.  And I hope you forget your time with us easily.  I hope your next family keeps you for your lifetime.  Yeah, I'm a suck sometimes. =*)

      Today is painful, folks . . . I have been counting down the minutes since 1:30pm . . . it's now 3pm and I still have 2 more hours of counting minutes before I can go home.  I was just over at  urlLink madpony , reading about college narcolepsy and sleepwriting . . . and unfortunately, it's not cured when you graduate.  Ahhhh, I remember those days . . . the last two months, when I was working 8 hours before going to school at 7am, were especially fun.  Luckily my professors knew and (strangely enough) liked me by then, and cut me A LOT of slack.  But I would be sitting there at my desk, genuinely interested in what was going on, and the next thing I knew, my eyes would be snapping open.  I'd fall asleep sitting up and not even know it.  And the harder I tried to stay awake, the sleepier I'd get.  It even happened at work.  The absolute worst was when I was asked to cover reception for a little while in the afternoon.  The boss's office was right next door, and I was just sitting there doing my work (or so I thought) when he comes around the corner and I'm woken up by a sarcastic comment from him.  That was horrifying.  I got fired from that job eventually. =)  I sure hope I don't get fired from this one.  Instead of doing work (which there really isn't any left to do at the moment, only adding to my problems), I figured I would blog about being sleepy, in the hopes that I at least  looked  like I was being productive.  I tried reading the Daily Oil Bulletin, seeing as I have about 5 days' worth to read, but today that has the same effect on me as a textbook.  And I can't even drink coffee, cuz my tummy's already upset from the 3 sips I had this morning.  Being bored and tired at work really REALLY sucks.

      There is just so much to say about this past weekend.  But where to start?  At the beginning, I suppose.  As you know, Friday was the funeral of a dear friend.  I cannot claim a 'close' friend, but I think 'dear' covers it.  I really wish I had known what exactly a prayer service is - there was one on Thursday evening.  I opted out, thinking it would be more religious than personal.  Unfortunately for me, it was just the opposite . . . if there was only one thing in this world I could change, I'd want to have gone to that Prayer Service.  Well, time being what it is, it's in the past now.  The funeral was more emotional (for myself) than I had expected.  The last funeral I went to was my grandma's when I was 12 years old.  I didn't even think to take kleenex with me.  It was really touching to see so many people show up.  But I think it speaks volumes to the type of girl she was.  It was made even more emotional by the fact that the deacon presiding is the father of one of her best friends.  There were many times he had to stop in mid-sentence to clear his throat, and we could all hear the tears in his voice.  I think the hardest part was the very end, just before they led her casket out of the church - her mother walked up to her picture to collect a few flowers, and her heartbreaking sobs were felt throughout the entire church.  There were many consoling hugs shared in the lobby afterwards.  I think (personally) the best part was when the song "Sherry" came on, by the Four Seasons.  It was turned up loud enough to hear outside, and some people starting singing along and dancing.  Shari probably giggled from her vantage point when she saw that.  After most of the people had drifted elsewhere, a group of us gathered at a friends' house.  Perhaps there's a bit of Irish in most of us, but we felt it was a time to get together, drink and share stories.  One thing that made it rather uncomfortable was the presence of BF's ex-girlfriend.  They had a tumultuous on-again-off-again relationship that ended very badly, and through a mere one degree of separation she has always been in the background.  I wasn't sure how I felt about this - it was already an emotional day, what good could possibly come of this?  I could understand her presence at the funeral, but was rather surprised when she showed up for the gathering afterwards.  Well, can you blame a girl for feeling a little insecure when you know your current beau thought he was going to marry this ex?  Surprisingly enough, they talked and BF came away feeling a lot lighter, having been able to put a lot of bad stuff under the bridge, so to speak.  It was eery - the atmosphere was such that I think a lot of us were expecting Shari to walk through the door at any point.  But I think there was a lot of comfort to be had for a lot of us in getting together that night.  There were lots of discussions going on, and a lot of closeness.  It made me resolve that, no matter what stage each of us were in our lives, I would try harder to stay in touch.  With two of our friends having babies soon, it's been awkward - we feel neglected and left behind, and I'm sure they half-expected us to follow suit.  I heard something very nice that night.  At one point, I was outside chatting with the two 'husbands', and of course children had come up.  I blurted out that they both had to have well-behaved babies for my sake.  They asked why, and then one piped up "cuz you want one yourself, don't you?"  I said no, but that I hoped to one day, and I knew BF still wasn't keen on the idea.  And joked that if they had well-behaved kids, he might change his mind.  The one husband (BF's best friend of a long time) said quietly "Wellll . . . . I've heard enough from him to know that he's not against them [having kids] . . . I think he's just afraid of you getting gung-ho about the idea."  And given some of the stories I've heard about his exes, I'm not surprised.  So, anyways, trust me to turn a weekend about my friends into one about me. =)  All in all, I don't know how else to describe it, except as a "Helluvaday".  Especially when we got home, and BF uttered a few words that I'd forgotten I'd been waiting to hear.  There's a bit of history behind this, but the short version is that we discovered quite early on that we have very different associations with the words "I love you."  Around 4 months into our relationship, I just  felt  it, like a cartoon Cupid's arrow suddenly striking me . . . I waited a week to test the waters, and didn't get the response I expected.  Over the next few months, it turned into a big deal, until we finally talked about it, and I found out that to him, "I love you" is about 2 shades away from "Marry me."  So I let it go.  I didn't feel it was worth ending a good relationship over.  And in the last week or so, I've heard the phrase twice.  As silly or distorted as it sounds, I'm almost afraid to break the spell by saying it back, even though I've been feeling it for so long.  It rolls around in my head daily, wanting to spill out, but held back for fear of making him anxious.  Part of me worries that if I voice it again, he might get freaked out . . . and the other part begs me to say it soon, lest he think my feelings have changed.  So yeah . . .   There were so many dimensions to this weekend.  Maybe I shouldn't have mooshed them all into one run-on post, but that's just how it came out.  Saturday was spent nursing a hangover, and Sunday was more visiting again.  Same friends from Friday (just two of them), and then friends from down the block, who just got a new puppy.  Although I wanted to write about all of this when it was still emotionally fresh and raw in my memory, I wouldn't trade the way I spent the weekend for anything in the world.

       A quick update on the accident   I only hear this stuff third-hand these days, because I'm only an acquaintance of the injured girl, and never met either of the guys.  So I almost feel like it's not my news to share.  But I think it's OK to let you know that one of the guys is out of the hospital today (he had a wound on his leg and is using a wheelchair for now), the one girl is in a body brace for a while, and the driver is still suffering from internal organ injuries.  But I think they're all hoping to be able to go to the funeral tomorrow.  I guess he (the driver) spends a lot of time trying to figure out what happened that night.  The only update in the papers is a plea for a witness to come forward (as they could describe a vehicle that probably witnessed it).  I feel pretty badly for these 3 people - they have a long hard road ahead of them, and not necessarily in a physical sense.  I can't imagine having to deal with that kind of a situation.  I think I have one more post to purge some of these "death" thoughts from my head, but after that, I'll try and keep that topic to a minimum.  I don't want to depress the few readers I have!

       For any Calgarian friends who may want to know . . .    There is a very touching tribute to Shari in the obituary section of today's paper.  It was there yesterday, and I'm sure it will probably run all week.  The online version is  urlLink here , and it's actually better than the one in the paper, being in colour and all.  It captures her so well, I can just imagine her giggling just after it was taken.

       Yet another update   This one is a little more personal and trustworthy - the best friend who has been doing her best to keep friends updated as she becomes more informed.  This is a mix of news and info from the other passengers:    "Shari was a passenger in her boyfriend's car on the way home from a friend's birthday at around 3am.  Her boyfriend was driving too fast for the corner to go from southbound McLeod Tr to eastbound Anderson Rd.  The car went over the cement guard rails and hit a light pole. Shari and Teri were not wearing seatbelts at the time and were ejected from the car. Shari died at the scene and the other 3 passengers (Teri, and their boyfriends) were airlifted to Foothills hospital.  They all have very serious injuries.  Luckily Colin passed the breathalizer exam contrary to initial reports that alcohol was a factor, it is now believed that the speed the car was going was the cause of the accident."    All I can say is, thank goodness alcohol wasn't involved.  Even though the speed still makes it an avoidable accident.  I have to go for now - I can't be thinking about this while I'm at work.

       More accident updates    urlLink Here's the most detailed news story on the accident.   I went over to a friend's house earlier tonight, and at 11pm, they stopped the movie they were watching to scan the news channels.  It was pretty gruesome.  The picture in the article is nothing compared to the video footage we saw tonight.  A mass of metal barely recognizable as a car was resting on it's roof, on the wrong side of a cement barrier, with a power pole where the engine might have been.  Hard to believe that 3 of the 4 people in that car are in the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.  And it hurts to see that anonymous "24-year-old woman" description . . . but I guess they can't release names until they're sure the family has been notified.  So what on earth am I doing on a Sunday morning at 1am scouring the internet for gruesome news stories?  BF is in so much trouble.  I dropped him off at 2pm - nearly 12 hours ago!! - for a bachelor party that he was sure wouldn't last very long.  The plan was to do some go-karting, and then the rest was up in the air.  I heard from him around 8pm saying they were on their way to something else, for me to go ahead and do whatever, he had no idea how long he'd be out.  That he'd call me later if he needed a ride.  And now I can stop the horrible images from flooding my brain.  I know the only person he would likely get a ride from is his brother.  I've been around his brother enough to know that he never turns down an opportunity to drink, and he thinks nothing of hopping in his car at the end of the night.  And I'm terrified because I have no idea if he's crashed (as in, passed out) at someone else's place, or if he's still out, or if he got a ride from his brother and . . . .   There's no way I can sleep until he's home, or at least until I've heard from him.  I'm so morbid.

         Ain't he just adorable?  Do you just wanna eat him up?  I do.  That's my baby.  Yes, this non-dog person's fondness has grown exponentially for pooches since having to give up her own.  I keep in touch with the agency every week or so, and last weekend, they happened to be at my usual pet store - and Rascal was there!  I wasn't prepared for the reaction I would have - I got all choked up, I was so emotional.  I had to dart down an isle to compose myself, because I didn't want to look like an idiot in front of all the people milling around.  They had him there to advertise (with some other dogs, as well) . . . and I was just so happy to see him.  When I'd finally pulled myself together somewhat, I went looking for him.  I wasn't sure if he recognized me, but his eyes and his manners seemed to say that he knew I was familiar, but perhaps wasn't sure why.  Which is OK.  He's been at the agency over a month now, and he seems so much happier.  But there haven't been any good candidates to adopt him.  Which is good and bad - good in the sense that I can still check up on him, and even see him from time to time.  Bad in that he deserves a permanent home.  It would be nice if things were different now, and we could take him back.  Not that they'd probably let us, but we can dream.  Sadly, things aren't really much different, so there wouldn't be much point.  I'd love to have him back, but I know things would just go back to the way they were and that wouldn't be good.  So I'll settle for looking at pictures, and the odd chance visit.

        You Will Be Remembered Fondly, Shari     It's just not right.  I still don't fully believe it.  I was woken up this morning to awful news . . . BF came in the room, said our friend Shari had been in a car accident last night, and had passed on.  She had a friend with her in the car, and as of right now, neither of us knows whether she's alive, in the hospital, or suffered the same fate.  People my age just aren't supposed to die.  Especially not people I know.  It's one thing if it's someone I'm complete removed from - I can feel horror at the tragedy, sorrow for the surviving family, but it's not  personal .  This is.  While she wasn't a best friend of mine, she was always someone whose company I enjoyed.  We didn't see each other terribly often, as she was best friends of another friend . . . but everyone was thrilled when she'd stop by, and would always give her a hard time if she left early for another engagement elsewhere.  She was a lively, bubbly little blonde girl, who always seemed to have a giggle bubbling just under the surface.  Yes - I've even said such things when she was still around.  She was always lamenting her single status, as most of her friends were paired off with long-term partners.  Until a few months ago, when she finally divulged to her best friend - after a month! - that she had someone special.  We were all eagerly waiting to hear from her again so we could meet this guy and see if he was worthy of her or not.  What do you say to her parents, her best friend, our other friends who were closer to her?    "I'm sorry" is just so over-used, so shallow, so inadequate for something like this.     Shari, know that you had endeared yourself to every person you met, and that the absence of your sunny presence will be deeply felt by all of us.      (6:00 PM - an update)  A few more details have trickled in, and it only makes matters worse.  I don't know if it's from a paper, or the verbal grapevine (ie trusted source), but this is what I heard a few hours ago -   Shari's boyfriend was driving, and there were two other passengers besides her - her friend and her friend's boyfriend, we are left to assume for now.  Alcohol is believed to be a factor, and it was a single-car collision.  Her boyfriend was driving down the road, lost control, jumped on the median and hit a light standard.  While the boyfriend is in the hospital (no word on his condition), the other two walked away with pressumably minor injuries.  Again, as I get all my information third hand, I have no idea what the source is.  But if this is all true, it's only going to make things harder for her family and those grieving with them.  I'm not one to pray, usually, but I think I will make a special case tonight.  I never ever imagined that drunk driving would hit so close to home.  But then again, who does?

       Tap, tap, tap . . . Anyone still around?    OK,  urlLink Joe , you can wipe that smirk off your face.  Yes, obviously I'm not completely done with my blog.  I think I miss having an outlet.  Still pretty busy, though, between a second job, a house to keep clean, and a body that needs regular trips to the gym or pool before it will shed any weight.  But I think I'll still try and post when time allows.  Like lazy lunchtimes when everyone else is working, or otherwise engaged, so there's nobody to visit with, and my little garden salad with chicken doesn't take very long to eat.  And I think that'll be it for today, because I want to savour the rice krispy square.  Mmmm, one of my few self-allowed vices (for a few weeks, anyways).

Not like I get much traffic (guess I'd know more if I installed a site meter, huh?) - but it makes me curious.  And you can play some fun games with that!  Like sidetracking someone looking for nubian goddesses available in mail-order bride format for kinky sexual experimentation?  Wow - I have no idea where that came from. =)  Must be almost time to go home.

        Walking (or rather, Slipping and Sliding) in a Winter Wonderland     True to form, it has finally snowed in Calgary.  It  always  snows either just before or on Halloween.  Were you really hoping that good weather would hold out,  urlLink Leah?   And youve been living here how long? =)  Just giving you a hard time, of course.  But it doesnt always come with such vehemence.  Evening rain that gradually turns to snow overnight?  Can we say disaster waiting to happen?  Most news stations this morning were advising that people who could should just stay home.  Man, was I tempted.  But having called in sick two days in a row, I figured Id better at least feign a good employee attitude and attempt to make it in.  But I left about 2 hours late in the hopes of avoiding the worst of traffic.  And since getting here, Ive heard rumours running around that someones going to call Dallas (our head office) to see if we can close down the office at noon to let everyone get home before darkness and another storm front.  Oh well  Ive made my presence, so no one can say I didnt try.  BF was like a little kid this morning.  Despite turning around and coming back home for an hour or so first thing (thanks to traffic hang-ups), he was jumping up and down, he was so excited.  He loves the snow, and he loves winter.  Dont ask me why  he doesnt even ski (thanks to a bum knee).  That boy is crazy . . . but I love him all the same. =)  And now Im going to have the impossible task of finding a snow brush.  Its about as easy as finding winter tires after the first big snowfall.  I dont remember if I wrote about it, but I got into an argument with my fancy-schmancy snow brush a month or so ago, and neither of us won.  The brush part flew off, so I was left with just the scraper end.  Not much good when theres 10cm of snow on your windshield.  And I have to find some gloves, too.  Ha  Im wishing  myself  good luck. =)  *giggle*  Speaking of fancy-schmancy . . . has anyone seen that new A&W commercial?  BF and I just kill ourselves laughing everytime we see it . . . probably cuz we could both see him pulling something like that! =)

      While I suppose that posting something on the internet makes it public in a very real way, I think there should be some sort of law that prevents very old ex's from reading and leaving comments on one's blog.  It's like the lowest form of stalking.  And it's creepy.  So don't do it.  Now I know how  urlLink Moxie  feels.

        Its All Good     Except for the fact that people keep bringing treats to work and leaving them in the kitchen for all of us weak-willed people to indulge in.  But it could be worse.  I could get all sentimental and philosophical, but Im not in the mood today.  I wrote up a post like that, then read it over and gagged. =)  Its all good.  Ive passed the critical 3-week point as far as working out goes.  In fact, I think it was the third week when I finally started working out 4-5 times a week instead of 2.  So I restarted my counting.  Im at week two, and I know Ill be sticking with it, at least for a few months.  I signed up with a friend for a class called Pilates on the Ball.  Yikes, I wish someone had warned me what pilates was like!  It looks like such a slacker class  you spend nearly all your time lying on the floor.  But boy oh boy, every move you make is deliberate and you have to hold it for so long!  I was sore for most of the weekend after my first class.  I think I want to try yoga after this class is done.  Whether the aerobic or meditative type, Im not sure yet, but Ive got a couple of months to decide.  Halloween is coming, and I think were going to decorate the house a little.  Its very easy to feel like the house is just another apartment, but now theres a holiday and we have this big area to decorate that other people will actually see.  Ive started having these little momentary thoughts of holy, am I really this grown up already?  I cant wait for Christmas! =)

        I'm Usually The World's Biggest Skeptic . . .      but I think I've found something pretty cool.  As I've mentioned before, I've been making a half-assed effort at losing weight (who isn't)?  My goal is only about 20lbs, but I'd rather lose it now than let it get out of control, and need to lose 60lbs in a few years.  And my efforts really have been half-assed, for the most part.  Only recently have I (once again) renewed my resolution, making a concrete goal to lose 15lbs by BF's Christmas party (8 weeks away).  There's only so far I'm willing to go with a diet - yes, I will do my best to eat more fruit.  Yes, I won't eat at MacDonald's once a week.  Yes, I will try and choose more health-conscious snacks for those mid-afternoon munchies.  But I won't completely revamp my eating habits, or completely cut out carbs, or start eating nothing but steaks and bacon, or anything radical like that.  Because chances are very good that it won't last more than a week (at most).  No sense doing something that isn't going to stick.  Which means it's all in the exercise for me.  And my biggest obstacle?  Having enough energy to workout after dinner.  So after 3 weeks of only being able to drag my butt out to the gym (or swimming) 2 out of 7 days, I decided I might need a little help.  WalMart has this huge mid-aisle display of something called  urlLink Xenadrine EFX  . . . I noticed it very plainly stated "Ephedra-free", which was a good start.  Normally, I'm a huge skeptic when it comes to weightloss aids, feeling that willpower was the only reliable way to go.  But since it was more directed at increasing your energy levels, I figured it was worth a try.  If it didn't work, no big loss.  If it did, great.  It's only been 5 days, but I notice a huge difference already.  Not in weight loss, but in energy level and focus.  I took my first dose on a Friday, so I didn't notice much difference at work.  But that evening, I was hyper.  This worried me a little, but figured my body probably just needed to adjust to the chemicals and vitamins.  So I persisted.  Monday rolled around, and amazingly enough I was alert -  all morning long.   And it was no trouble at all having the energy to go to the gym after dinner.  And my friend even joined me at the gym last night, which was awesome.  While I don't mind working out alone, it sure makes the time pass more pleasantly when you have company.  So we'll see if it helps me lose weight.  Even if it doesn't, I've got more energy, and I'm not exhausted when I get home from work.  My mood is even better (but that's harder to attribute to any one thing), and I just generally feel good.  The only concern . . . and maybe  urlLink Desiree , being a former nurse, might be able to shed some light . . . is that it might change the effectiveness of the pill.  I've searched around, but the only articles I can find are ads and clinical studies.  So, with that, I'm off for a lunchtime jog today . . . !!!

        The Dreaded Family Gatherings     This weekend was filled with activity.  Friday night was spent with a few friends around a fire in our backyard.  I'm hoping we can have a few more of those before it gets too cold.  Sunday we took part in the Breast Cancer run/walk.  And Saturday was a wedding.  In BF's family, of course.  I have such a small family of my own that weddings are few and far between.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the next one won't be until I get married myself.  BF has a huge family.  I mean HUGE.  His dad is the youngest of 12 kids, his granny is still around, and many of his aunts and uncles have children and grandchildren of their own.  For the most part, I don't mind his family.  But lately, every large family gathering is turning into a trial.  I think all you unmarried or married-without-children couples out there will know what I'm talking about . . . the first thing out of everyone's mouth is "So . . . when are you two getting married?"  And with a family as big as his, it gets old . . . FAST.  People I hadn't even met before were asking me when it was going to be our turn.  Some asked him first, and then would turn to me as if to say "Well, what's wrong with you that you haven't made him ask you yet?"  Others would skip him (knowing him better) and ask in a more conspiratorial tone, "So, when are you guys going to do this?", nodding towards the newlyweds.  I think we spent most of the 45-minute drive home coming up with things to say at the next occasion.  We already know that another cousin of his is getting married in June next year.  His brother got married this past January, and they're expecting their first baby this coming January.  All eyes are on him now, with almost every other relative (over 20) being married and/or having kids.  And I don't doubt that when we do eventually get married, the interrogation won't stop.  Then it will be, "So when are you guys going to have a baby/give me grandkids/etc."  *sigh*  I guess it's all part of the package.  I think BF is getting off incredibly easy - I don't see a whole lot of my own family, and when we do, I don't think I've ever been asked when we plan on getting married.  Of course, my mum knows the deal, and I've talked to her.  The last time I went over to visit, she admitted as I was leaving that she thought I'd come over to say I was engaged.  And then proceeded to tell me if I DID get engaged anytime soon, I couldn't get married within a year cuz she just wasn't ready.  I love my mum.  And she's never bugged me about grandkids, either.  I still haven't figured out if she meant she wasn't ready from an emotional point of view, or financial.  Don't get me wrong - BF and I have pretty much agreed that it's mostly a matter of being able to afford it completely on our own.  But I know my mum, and I know she would feel a lot better if she could offer to help out.  Especially knowing that BF's father is very well-off.  But apart from all the questions, it was a good time.  BF was very happy to see his granny (as she lives in Ontario and probably doesn't have many years left), and as much as he may complain about his family himself, he enjoys being able to visit with them.  I think the highlight of the evening was a twist on the wishing well . . . "I'm Too Sexy" came on, and several of the bridesmaids cornered the groom on the dancefloor and proceeded to strip him.  He got right into it . . . after the jacket, vest and tie had been shed, the shirt came unbuttoned and he leaped up on to one of the tables.  There were several older women sitting there, and they cheered him on and started tucking bills into his pants!!  I've never seen that at a wedding . . . it'll be something to remember, that's for sure.  As much as I complain, and as much as they can be overbearing, BF's family sure knows how to have a good time.  I think I'm looking forward to the next wedding.

        Score 1 for Angela after 14592 for Telus     Finally . . . I get somewhere.  And lucky for them (and me, I guess) it was enough so that I have lost the motivation to look elsewhere for telephone services.  Maybe 3 really is the magic number . . . this was the third customer service rep I dealt with on this issue.  #1 made vast promises, but they never materialized.  #2 was just plain stubborn and refused to budge an inch.  But #3 knew what customer service is about.  I have been trying to get acknowledgement from Telus in the form of a credit, because it took so friggin long for them to get our phone service hooked up at the new house.  And it was made even worse when I got that $45 moving charge.  And today, they finally reversed it.  I didn't have to lose my temper, or be a bitch, or anything.  I told her very reasonably that I understood they needed to charge a moving fee, but that I just wanted some sort of a credit for the inconvenience of having to wait 6 weeks, and thus generating horrendous cell phone bills.  I probably would have been fine with $20, but she said, "OK, your account has been credited the $45, and it'll show up on your next bill."  And now I'm happy once again.  I feel just a little less taken-advantage-of, and that's a good feeling.

        I hate fighting.     Especially with someone I come home to every day.  Especially when it's still unresolved when we leave for work.  I've always been a pleaser.  Since I was a kid, I never wanted to disappoint, meaning I was a helluvan easy child to discipline.  All my dad had to do was give me that 'look', and I immediately felt bad.  Over the years I've mellowed a bit, realizing that I can't please everyone all the time, and that often some things just aren't worth making myself miserable for the sake of someone else.  BF is quite the opposite.  He'll do what is right by him, regardless of how it affects others.  Well, OK, he's not callous, but it makes for some interesting dynamics between us.  It can be such a demanding job sometimes, striking that balance between independence and being considerate of one another.  I think it's the biggest challenge a couple faces when they live together (whether married or not).  Last night was one of those nights that things are out of balance.  I'm pretty sure BF thought there wasn't a problem, and I take part of the blame in that I should have said something last night.  Unfortunately, I learned far too much from my dad, and sometimes I will resort to old habits by pretending things are OK, and then make a snide comment when the opportunity arises.  I waited until he was almost out the door this morning to say anything.  And we have this routine.  BF knows when he's done something I'm not thrilled with, and he'll ask, "Are you mad that I . . . [insert whatever]?"  And after 2.5 years, I've learned that this has two translations: 1)  "Do I have some sucking up to do before I can get laid tonight?"  and 2)  "You'd better not be mad cuz I had every right to do what I did."  Usually I can tell by his tone which one it is.  Last night was a #2, and this irked me because  I  thought I had every right to be upset.  It was something pretty non-major - he wasn't home when I got there (no big deal - a commone occurrence) so I called to see when he thought he would be.  So I'd know whether to go ahead and eat or wait for him.  He said he was over at a recently-ex-coworkers' having a few beers.  But now, I don't remember if he said "A beer" or "a few beers", because in our house, it's a huge distinction.  "A beer" means "I'll be home soon" and he often specifically says so (that he'll be home soon).  "A few beers" means "I've already had a couple, and maybe I'll have a few more, who knows?"  He didn't say if he'd be home soon or not.  I knew that he missed the 'farewell' pub night for this particular guy, so it was rather ambiguous.  As a side note - have any of you noticed how the longer you're with someone, the more translations you learn, and the more assumptions get made when you're talking to each other?  Anyways, Thursday is the night with all the good TV shows, and this causes me much consternation, as it's usually an exercise night.  So I'd planned on going to the gym early in order to still be able to watch them, which meant I needed to eat early.  Which meant that I felt malicious as I cooked enough for two, not knowing whether he'd be home before it got cold and getting more and more irked the more time went by.  And I was too stubborn to simply call and find out when he'd be home.  I mean, I fight hard against that whole "nagging girlfriend" stereotype.  And on top of it, I was somewhat jealous - he's always got someone to go out for a beer with after work, while I never have that opportunity.  So I ate alone, and left for the gym rather steamed (he still wasn't home).  So I was pretty mad by the time I finally got home.  And thus began the routine . . . "Are you mad that I went for a beer after work?" . . . to which I replied "No, but I'm upset that you didn't say when you'd be home" and left it at that.  But I was still mad, and waited until this morning to say "So am I going to hear from you if you're not going to be home tonight?"  (yes, I can see some of the cringes out there).  There was a somewhat shocked pause, and a mumbled but unmistakeably pissed "yeah sure".  So yeah, we left for work this morning mad at each other, and I needed to vent about it.  By tonight, I'll probably have calmed down enough to say all this to him, and he'll say he's sorry (but he won't say that it won't happen again, cuz we both know it eventually will), and all will be fine again.  Assuming he isn't so pissed off that he goes out for 'a few beers' right after work tonight.  But I really hope not.  Who knows?  Maybe we subconsciously play these little fights out just for the makeup sex . . . =)  But I still hate fighting . . . especially with a person I love.

        Office Pranks on a Grand Scale      Ever remember hearing a story when you were younger about a garden gnome that went missing from his yard?  And how the owner would periodically get "Wish you were here . . . " postcards from around the world, prominently featuring the missing gnome?  Well, we seem to have our own little version going on at the office.  Only instead of a garden gnome, it's a coffee mug with sentimental value.  At all started when my office-neighbour started campaigning around the office - "Have you seen my mug?  Someone's got my mug!  You know, the one with 'Pepperdine University Dad' on it?  Is it you?"  He just happens to be the office prankster, so many of us got a good chuckle, hoping that perhaps he'd met his match.  And thus started the adventure.  Within a day, emails were being delivered to the distressed mug-dad along with incriminating photos.  To our delight, we're being kept updated via the office kitchen.  It appears that the coffee mug just wasn't feeling appreciated.  That it needed some space, some time, and wanted to explore new things.  There were a few photos of it on a dashboard, obviously headed out of town.  The emails became taunting . . . a photo of the delinquent mug proudly perched on the hood of his dad's truck.  The written messages morphed into sassy poems - "Roses are Red, Violets are Blue, I'm Sitting Right Here on Your Truck - Where The Heck are You???"  And this afternoon is the best yet . . . during a staff meeting, our president announces that a suspicious package arrived today.  That after the bomb squad gave it the 'OK' (joking, of course), they found a tape inside.  What we watched next was a taping of the A-Channel Big Breakfast Show . . . which featured Dave Kelly pointedly displaying his mug every chance he got, and even nodding to the camera once or twice while doing so, as if toasting someone out in the audience . . . and yes, it was Larry's mug.  Seems this mug is really out to make a point.  Apparently he needs celebrity lips in order to feel appreciated these days.  I wonder where he'll turn up next?  Maybe he'll come home for Christmas . . . ???

        Is It Just Me?     What is it about this time of year that makes women start  urlLink looking around?   Or is it just me?  Seeing all the designs online makes me want to go and browse the store now . . .   To be perfectly honest, I probably wouldn't know what to do with myself if I actually got one . . . I just like looking. =)  Hmmm . . . kinda like my intense curiosity about pregnancy and babies . . .

        Shouldn't We At Least Get a Kiss Out of The Deal?     I'm absolutely livid this morning.  I got my car insurance renewal notice last week.  I was angry then, but had to wait a week to deal with it since I was on course.  My history?  Never a claim, never a ticket (other than parking, which doesn't count), never a break in coverage, absolutely clean since I got my license when I was 17.  And when other people have been at fault?  Nothing but headaches and hassles and fighting just to get my car fixed properly.  While I heard of friends and acquaintances getting thousands for almost non-existent injuries, I've NEVER gotten anything above and beyond the cost of fixing my car.  Despite this, I'm being told that my premiums have gone up by nearly $240 for the next year.  My initial reaction - "What about this rate freeze we've been hearing about?  Aren't you breaking a law or something?"  Their response - "Well, the government hasn't told us how we're supposed to deal with that yet.  We have thousands of clients, and nowhere near the manpower to review every account and credit them."  My reply - "But this was drawn up  after  October 30."  I didn't get a satisfactory answer to that one.  So I said I'd be shopping around.  She was polite enough, saying she wished she could do something but her hands were tied.  So I called around.  I knew that my ASET membership entitled me to group benefits at Meloche, but they quoted me an even higher rate than the one I'd been bumped to by TD.  So I hopped on Kanetix, but to no avail.  Even with them, their lowest quoted rate was barely $20/yr less than what I'm currently supposed to be paying.  What made it even worse was that my premiums got withdrawn today.  $20 more than I've been paying the past few months, and $20 more than I'd budgetted for.  Of course, $20 on its own is not hard to come up with, but it's the principle.  So I called TD back.  Said that if I had no choice but to pay these new rates (making it VERY clear how angry I was about it, but trying to be diplomatic), I wanted to add my BF to my policy since he'd sold his car and would be cancelling his policy.  I think I really would have lost it if they'd told me this would increase my premiums even more.  Luckily, it didn't.  I'll admit, given that they're probably getting a helluva lot of these calls lately, she was very patient with me.  Told me the only course of action I had at this point was to call the government myself, and even went so far as to give me the number.  I intend to call.  That doesn't make me any less angry at the insurance company - they're profitting off me, for cryin' out loud.  Anybody else going through this at the moment?  This came out of left field to me, because up until this month, they were offering me discounts all over the place - for having a multi-vehicle household, for having property insurance as well, etc.  My monthly premiums had dropped about $9 from what I'd originally been paying when I signed up last December.  And in my brief search, I found the  urlLink CAC Auto Insurance Rates Review .  Turns out Calgarians are paying among the highest rates, and have also experienced one of the highest increases as well.  Being the control freak that I am, this is probably the highest level of frustration for me - knowing there's basically nothing I can do about it.  I mean, shouldn't we at least be getting a kiss before they f*^@ us over like that?

        Random Brain Farts     - I got my ears pierced on Friday.  Neither one hurt at all until the left one started giving me trouble last night.  Now it just sucks. =(   - I also got a free makeover by the Lancome girls at The Bay on Friday.  I looked damn fine.  Everyone kept looking at me, whereas I'm usually a pretty non-attention-demanding girl.  BF said I looked like a clown.  I'd like to say he didn't get any that night for that comment, but  knowing you look good has a way of making a girl randy. =)~   - Up until about a year ago, alcohol had this really weird effect on me.  Somehow, the combination of 3 or more drinks made me think that the night would be more interesting if I lost my shirt (or more).  Oddly enough, this made BF rather proud.  And many random men pretty happy.  And me pretty giddy.  What can I say?  I like making people happy. =)   - My BF's dad actually said to him once, before the last company BBQ (yes, his dad is his boss, too) - "And make sure Ang  wears  something this time."  I don't think HE particularly minded, but apparently his wife gave him heck after last years' BBQ.  I thought my sundress was entirely appropriate.  I think she was just jealous that she couldn't wear something like that.  A couple of the older men seemed pretty happy that day.  Like I said - I like making people happy.   - I actually applied for a job at the French Maid Speakeasy last summer.  As a waitress, not a dancer, I'll add.  I never got a call.  Boo on them - I think that would have been a fun summer job. =)   - This post is entirely too nakedness/sex obsessed.  Hmmm, I think I know what I'm doing when I get home tonight.

        *groan* It's Monday again?     Ya, Monday seems like as good a day as any to complain.  I'm really  REALLY  glad I have the chance to get away this weekend.  I have Friday off, we're heading to Banff, I get to dress up, and it'll be a big drunkfest.  Only thing that sucks is going to be driving home hungover on Sunday. =)  I'm stressed out.  I don't care who thinks I'm being a crybaby, or who thinks I should "suck it up" . . . goodness knows I've told myself that enough times.  I'm stressed out and I feel like complaining.  I think I need to re-arrange my work hours.  This just isn't working for me anymore.  I'm addicted to going to the gym, so now I start to feel gross if I'm not able to go for a few days in a row.  And between the snow, public transportation, and not being done work til 5pm, I feel like I'm racing through one thing just to get to the next and race through it, too.  I get home from work, often running an errand or two along the way, decide on the fly whether or not to make dinner right away or eat later (usually based on the presence of BF or lack thereof), try to do some minor cleaning up because a messy house makes me even more irritable, race off to the gym, come back 2 hours later, hurry to make something to eat and somehow fit a shower in there, too, and then hope I can relax for half an hour before going to bed.  But often the relaxing isn't really relaxing . . . either I'm trying to get a load of laundry done, clean up something that's been really bugging me, or one of a hundred other inane things that seem to come as part'n'parcel of having a house and two cats.  Where's BF in all of this?  Well, I just recently found out - being annoyed that my schedule is throwing off his eating habits cuz he claims he's 'constantly waiting for me'.  So that just stresses me out more.  Occasionally he cleans up while I'm gone - I don't want to make him out to be a pig - but not nearly enough.  And then, at least one weeknight, I sacrifice all of the above to work at the old job.  The money's great, and impossible to say no to, and I still have a sense of responsibility to the job, but a lot of weeks lately, I would rather spend that night off getting some cleaning done and just relaxing.  And Saturdays are rarely much better, since I work again at the old job . . . the only concession being that I get to sleep in.  And by Sunday, so many chores and errands and laundry have piled up that I just try to pretend that pausing a movie every 1/2-hour is relaxing.  And the whole time, I'm getting flak from BF . . . dramatic sighs when I ask to pause the movie, little comments when I get home later than expected . . . he thinks and says he's just joking, but that's not how it's received.  *sigh*  OK, I think I'm done for now.

        A Good Ol' Shakeup     For the most part, I'm really enjoying this week.  I'd pretty much established a routine - I'm pretty big on routines.  Mind you, I also love a little shakeup every now and then that forces me into a new routine.  I'm on course this week.  So it feels really weird to come downtown still, but I get to come here later (although traffic on the road and trains is much worse), and I'm not in the office.  I feel kinda disconnected from everything at work, which is even more disorientating because I was just getting really involved at the end of last week.  I'd forgotten how mentally exhausting a course can be, though!  Even though I'm only there from 8:30-12:00 and 1:00-4:30, whereas I would normally work 7:15-4:45, I find it more draining to be at the course.  But it's a good feeling at the end of the day, because it reminds me that my brain hasn't atrophied since leaving school. =)  And it makes me crave even more learning.  Funny how that is, huh?  Somethings, when you're overwhelmed by then, make you want to avoid them for the rest of your life.  And others just make you crave even more of it.  And I can't wait to get back to work to hopefully apply some of the stuff I'm learning.  But for now - it's back to learning!

        Tragedy Chez Ang     My beloved Civic has not been doing so well lately.  I guess it's not brand new anymore, but still.  We have a new street by my house, and it gets me home from the main street faster than the old route.  And there's a bonus - with all the snow, and a lack of houses on that street, it's perfect for practicing e-brake turns.  Only problem is, I must have done something wrong last Friday.  Underestimating just how slick it was around the first corner, instead of doing just a neat ass-end whip around, I started heading straight for the curb.  It was inevitable.  Luckily (or unluckily), the curb was well-padded with a pile of snow.  So I jumped a snow bank instead of a curb.  But I got stuck.  Between Shari and my grandma, they're sure keeping on top of me up there, cuz our neighbour came by just seconds later (it's not a heavy-traffic road or anything), and went home to get his 4x4 Toyota and a tow rope.  I was on my way again in less than 10 minutes.  But the story doesn't end there.  As I went on my merry way to a double-session of Pilates, the car started vibrating something horrible.  Panick-stricken, I pulled over to see if anything was visibly wrong - perhaps a flat tire, a big chunk of ice, or a bad alignment from the snow-bank-hopping.  I couldn't see anything, so just kept driving, albeit a little more carefully.  It never happened again, so I chalked it up to a chunk of snow or ice being caught underneath the car.  Until we went to wash it this weekend.  Between BF and I, we're diligent car-washers - always paying close attention to the wheel wells, as that's where rust often starts.  And that's when BF noticed that the front passenger side wheel was missing the plastic piece that isolates the wheel well from the engine compartment.  Darn, darn, darn.  I was almost hysterical, until BF said it was just a plastic part and he could replace it himself if I got the part from Honda.  And last night, I got my first rock chip on the windshield.  That one makes me mad, because I have no control over that.  But I suppose it's about time - there have been several occasions when I've been driving along and something very loud hits the windshield, and there's not a single mark.  Last night scared the shit out of me, it was that loud.  Poor, poor, car.  I'm sorry you got stuck with me - apparently it's not just my luck, it must be my driving.  And I promise I'll replace your bumper just as soon as someone rear-ends me . . .

        I Heart Nyquil     I felt a little evil last night.  There was only one dose of Nyquil left, but I didn't realize this until I started pouring.  BF has had a chest cold for the last few days (meaning a rather nasty cough) and I've just been stuffed up.  But I ended up having the last dose.  But man did I sleep well.  I think I had a dream about puppies, and I was trying to choose a new dog for us.  And BF tells me he woke up a few times to me pushing him over.  He has this habit of following me across the bed, until I'm practically falling off.  But I had a good sleep all the same.  And I didn't want to get up this morning.  If only today were Saturday, I would heart Nyquil even more. =)

        This Morning's Train Of Thought Had Wonderful Consequences . . .      Wanna follow the train?  Hop on . . .   While reading  urlLink Sepi's  latest this morning, she happened to mention googling . . . hmmm, never googled anyone, but what could my name pop up? . . . googled myself with only one result . . . suddenly decided to see what other family members might come up . . . found an uncle! . . . could it be him? . . . maybe there were lots of Peter Kitchins on that side of the world . . . kept looking . . . 'Becky Kitchin' . . . again, referred to the same Peter Kitchin site . . . had to be them . . .   My dad had always said that artistic talent ran strong, especially in that particular branch of his family.  I'm really hoping it runs somewhere in me, and maybe shows up in somewhere in my children . . .   Go check them out!   urlLink My Uncle Peter's art site    urlLink My Cousin Becky's art site   Really makes me wish I'd kept some of the sketches in the letters our parents made us send each other as children.  I thought they were cool even back then.  Wonder if they'd think I was weird if I sent them an email now . . .

       urlLink Turns out I had it right all along.   I have never been a fan of diets.  I've always maintained that it does nothing for me.  That exercise was the key, and that once I'm able to maintain a decent level of exercise, it really doesn't matter what I eat (within reason, of course).  And now studies prove me right.  I like it when I'm right.

        A Touchy Subject     It's not very often that I mull over controversial issues on here.  Mostly I just ramble on and on about things that are only relevant or important or interesting to me and nobody else.  But for reasons I'd rather not disclose, I've been thinking a little about the topic of abortion lately.  For those of my 'in-the-flesh' friends reading this: No, it's not because I've had one.  Mind you, I doubt I would admit to it even if I had.  And hey - it's been in the news, too.  The Americans have decided to revisit this volatile debate in regards to partial-birth abortions.  It makes me wonder - how would I feel about an unexpected pregnancy?  At this point in my life, it would likely be undesired in addition to unexpected.  But which option would be harder to live with: the knowledge that I terminated the pregnancy and thus deprived a baby of its life, or the changes and accomodations I would have to make for parenthood?  Because really - if I wasn't emotionally attached to or felt responsible for that thing inside me,  would  it really be that traumatic to terminate it?  I really couldn't say without actually being in that position, and I hope to God that I never am.  The fact in itself that I  don't  know what I would do in this situation causes me some unease.  I grew up in a Catholic family.  My beloved grandma, when she was alive, was a very active and vocal member of a pro-life organization.  I grew up with the assumed belief that abortion was inherently wrong.  No self-respecting or life-respecting person would do such a thing.  But as I grew older, I realized that this was a very personal issue.  I changed my stance - though rather quietly - to one of pro-choice.  Even so, I always maintained that for me, personally, abortion could never be an option.  And now I'm at a rather precarious point in my life.  I have friends making the choice to get pregnant and start families.  I'm old enough and reasonably financially stable enough to potentially care for a child.  And with a long-term boyfriend and all that entails, there's always that miniscule possibility.  It's not as if I'm still a child myself, still in school or working minimum wages jobs, or single.  On the one hand, it seems like it would be very hard to justify an abortion to myself, given my lack of reasonable excuses.  I don't think I could ever admit to anyone if I went through with one.  The only excuse I have is that I'm not ready.  But is that a reasonable excuse?  OK, excuse is really the wrong word to use here.  What I mean is, is not being ready a good enough reason to live with whatever guilt (or maybe not?) might ensue?  Then again, is it fair to impose such a responsibility on myself, my boyfriend, and the baby that will eventually come?  Through all of this contemplation, I've come to a conclusion:  I'm going to stop thinking about it unless I have to.  I'm pro-choice -  end of story.   Even if such a choice might cause me great pain and agony one day.  I will just cross my fingers (and take my pills!) and hope I never have to make such a decision.

        It's not  what  you know, it's  who  you know!     Well, OK, obviously you eventually need to know something.  But it's amazing what talking to the right people can do for you.  I'd been procrastinating about talking to my boss about my lack of work.  I wanted to make sure I exhausted all other options and little tasks before demanding some of his precious time.  I finally talked to him today, and I finally feel better about things.  It turns out he has a whole list of things he keeps wanting to pass off to me, but without any nagging from me, it was easy for him to just let it slip.  But now that I've brought it up, he's given me a few more responsibilities with the promise of more.  And promised to talk to the other engineers about assigning me some more responsibility.  Because the one thing I can't stand above all others is going to a job where I feel useless and unproductive.  Job satisfaction ranks #1 on my list of employment priorities.  Of course, adequate pay comes in a pretty close #2, but I can ignore that longer than a pointless job.  So I'm finally happier about work.  Which is good, because I'm at a point in my life where I need to settle down career-wise if I want to make any progress.  And since I don't plan on having kids anytime soon, what the heck else is there for me to do with my days? =)

      Well - here's something that makes me happy.  The  urlLink Talisman Centre  has set up their own Masters Swim Program.  The last two years, I've passively wanted to sign up for the  urlLink Calgary Masters Swim Club  but the waiting list is about 170 people long.  Even with prior competitive swimming experience, it only gets me about halfway up this long list.  So I was pretty excited to learn this.  It's a little pricey ($250 for a 4-month session, 3 days a week vs. $440 for the year for up to 5 days a week with the Club), but worth it if I can get in.  I miss swimming a lot.  And aquacize only entertains me for so long.  Because what I truly miss is the structured/coached practices where I can watch my strokes, speed, and endurance improve.  I have to wait until a week Monday to register, and then wait until the end of January for the program to start.  But it's something to look forward to after Christmas is over and done with.

        A Rant About How Much It SUCKS To Work Downtown     I  HATE  riding the C-train. I  HATE  all the stupid people who are already on the train before me. I  ESPECIALLY HATE  the stupid people who can't move a little bit further into the aisle so that people at the train station don't have to wait for yet another train.  ESPECIALLY  when it's -19C outside. Because you can do the friggin chicken dance if you're in the aisle, there's that much room, but anyone in the doorways are crammed in like sardines. I  HATE  traffic. I  HATE  the stupid people who drive 80km/h on the freeway when it's plenty safe enough for the 100km/h speed limit. I  HATE  the stupid people in SUVs and big trucks who tailgate me when 40 is the fastest I can safely go on the icy side streets. Then again, keep it up - I wouldn't mind a new bumper at your expense. I  HATE  leaving home at 6:30am and getting to work at 7:30am.  I miss having a stress-free 5-minute drive to work. I  HATE  arriving at work and leaving again with all the other lemmings. I  HATE  working downtown.  On that same token . . .     A Rant About How Much My New Job Still SUCKS      WHY?   WHY  did I have to leave my old job?  SURE , they were all chauvinistic pigs there.  BUT , they were less so around me cuz they knew I knew stuff they didn't, and joked back with them. I  HATE  how I still don't know a whole lot at my new job. I  HATE  how everyone else has a purpose, work to keep them busy all day long. I  HATE  how I'm the only one who doesn't seem to know what their job is. I  HATE  how I have to bug other people for work when I get bored. Which is all the time lately. Because they're all busy. And have to stop what they're doing to give me something to do. I  HATE  how I seem like the stupidest person here. Because I'm not. At least, I'm not a stupid person. Because I used to be one of the smartest people at my old job. And that felt good. And this doesn't. I'm constantly paranoid that one day, my boss is going to come in and say "Come see me in my office" and I'll go and he'll give me a talking to for wasting time on the internet, when really, I've been around to so many people asking "Is there anything I can help you with?" and they say "No" or "I'll see" and then they never get back to me cuz they're all busy.  IT SUCKS.  I  WISH  I'd never left my old job. But then I wouldn't have an RRSP plan, or a real benefit plan, that ends up covering most of BF's dental surgery cuz his plan sucks. And then my friend wouldn't have a regular job that she seems to like. And I would probably be getting paid less. But I wouldn't  HATE  traffic as much. I wouldn't have to  HATE  taking the train, because I wouldn't have to take it. I wouldn't have to feel guilty about wasting time on the internet, because I'd know what to do to keep myself busy. Or it just wouldn't matter. I  HATE  how the hours are so rigid here.  "7:30am to 5pm" , no flexibility. Gotta leave early for a doctor's appointment? Better make it up to the minute by working lunch hours!  Or staying late! Old job said - is your working getting done?  Is there anything urgent that needs attention?  No?  Then don't worry about it!  We're not keeping track! Here, nobody likes someone who wants to bend the rules to suit them. There, nobody cares, so long as the work gets done.  THIS SUCKS.

      Hmmmm . . . methinks I need to go shopping.   urlLink Lookie here!    urlLink And here!   Now if only one could look like that just by buying the items . . .   UPDATE:  Sorry to be a tease.  Not sure why the links don't work, but now I can't find them again anyways.  Just some lingerie from LaSenza that I want to buy. =)

        Promises, promises     Even though this year was kinda boring, next year I think I definitely want to do the pub crawl.  And I've pretty much decided I'm going to go as a wench.  Cuz I love costumes where I get to show off cleavage.  I'd post pictures of last years' (or was it two years ago now???) costume for the pub crawl, but then I might be toeing the porno line.   =)

        Winter Blues     I sure hope I dont suffer from  urlLink  SAD  . . . otherwise itll be a miserable winter.  But I just havent felt like myself lately, and because I cant find a reasonable explanation for it, it bothers me even more.  Great sarcastic thanks go out to my mum and my friends sister . . . youve made me paranoid until next week!  Earlier this week, I was telling my mum how I hadnt been feeling 100% the last 2 weeks, but not outright sick.  Just a little queasy some of the time, and generally exhausted for the rest of the time.   Mum: Well, is it  that time of the month ? (sadly, yes, thats how we talk in my family).   Me: No, not until next week (thinking she was trying to draw a PMS conclusion).   Mum: Well, I guess if it doesnt come, then you know youre in trouble or something to that effect.  Yeah, thanks mum.  And then, just to reinforce my paranoia, we were over at my good friends lovely new  own  digs on the weekend, when her sister blurted out something very similar (though quite out of the blue, if I remember right).  Of course, I dont either of them are right, but that small kernel of doubt has been planted nonetheless . . . because no matter what you do, theres always that small chance.  But 90% of the time, the thought doesnt even cross my mind.  But now with all the pregnant women around me, Im starting to wonder if it really  is  something I can catch. =O  And just to add to my winter blues, two weeks of absenteeism (thanks to not feeling great) and an abundance of Halloween candy have undone the good results Id gotten from 4 weeks of hard work at the gym. =(  Boohoo.  Now I have to work even harder and ignore not feeling well if I want to reach my month-end goal.  Speaking of Halloween, I think it was the quietest ever.  I was kind of excited about having a house that kids might actually come up to.  I didnt expect many, being in a new development still under construction, but I was hoping for a few.  Despite my initial Ba-humbug attitude, I got excited and was hurriedly putting up decorations and tracking down ice melt at 5pm on Friday.  I carved my very first pumpkin, too!  I thought it looked pretty good.  I get such pitying looks from people when I tell them I carved my very first pumpkin this year. =)  All for 2 trick-or-treaters.  And one looked like he might have been stoned, if he hadnt been so young and perched on Dads hip. =)  I dont think he had a clue what was going on.  The other totally made up for the first ones lack of enthusiasm . . . we could hear him screaming Trick or Treat!! from the sidewalk!  And he couldnt have been more than 2 or 3 feet tall . . . that was cute.  So, around 8:30pm, we decided wed seen all the trick-or-treaters we were going to see, shut off the porch light, and headed over to a friends house.  Theyd had about 30 kids, they figured, but they were done for the night, too.  We watched a little TV, chatted for a bit, and then played a couple games of Labyrinth.  Its hardly the exciting pub-crawl night of some, and even though it made me feel kind of old and boring (even though we were both feeling a little under the weather), I wouldnt trade in the quality time with friends for anything.  Saturday saw a good friend of mine moving into her first apartment!  I felt a little bad  Id told her Id help, but then realized I might not be of much use since I didnt have a truck.  I didnt feel as bad when she told me a couple of male co-workers (one with a truck) showed up, but still . . . I  did  say Id help.  But BF and I went over later in the evening to check it out and keep her company for a while.  Her sister and sisters boyfriend showed up, and her best friend was already there.  Its a pretty good place, especially as first apartments go, and its got a lot of space!  Plus, its right in the area of the city shes always wanted to live in.  Im so happy for her, even though its lonely right now.  Having felt a burning need to just  go out , BF and I headed to the peelers after that.  It used to be a little more fun . . . until about 6 months ago, youd never see a woman at a strip club, unless she was there to dance.  Which meant I was special and got a lot of looks from the other patrons, and sometimes from the dancers, too.  I guess Im an attention whore at heart, just like my friend  urlLink Leah .  Now, at the  urlLink Speakeasy  in particular, you often see groups of women right up in pervert row.  Which I see nothing wrong with, but suddenly Im not so special for going. =)  A lot of my friends think Im weird for going, but I see nothing wrong with it.  But you definitely have to be in the right frame of mind for it.  We were only there a short while, but I can home pleasantly buzzed and in a good mood  much to BFs delight. *wink*  Wow  Im terribly longwinded today!  Pretty unusual . . . =)  And finally, yesterday was spent being a loving and caring girlfriend. =)  BF had his dental surgery.  When he came out, the nurse motioned to me that he needed a lot of TLC.  Going in, his biggest worry was that the anesthetic would wear out, despite stressing to his periodontist that his body metabolized it unusually fast.  It turns out they had to re-freeze his mouth 3 times, and he still felt way too much of what was going on.  Apparently, what they gave him should have easily lasted 16 hours, and he was only in there for just over an hour!  If theres one thing on this earth that I really cant stand, its seeing a loved on in pain.  So I spent last night fussing over him.  And Im sure none of this is interesting to anyone but myself, but I dont care.  Its been a while since I posted, and I felt like writing a novel about my boring life.  Maybe Ill come up with something interesting to write next time.  Maybe not.  =)  Oh well.

        Wow    Is about all I can come up with.  I keep trying to imagine what it would be like if it was me bringing home a brand new baby.  And all I can imagine is being overwhelmed.  It's kind of scary to hold him.  He's so tiny, he can't do anything for himself.  If someone sets him in my arms, and my arms start to get tired, I'm afraid to move him in case he breaks.  What if I'm not holding him right?   Terrified  is what I'd be if it was me having to look after this little thing.  Terrified.  Dad is so funny.  We still can't believe he's a father.  We laugh at him everytime he jumps when the baby makes a sound.  The way he rushes into the room when the baby starts crying.  Mom seems amazingly calm and accepting of everything that's going on.  Whether it's just the face she puts on for company, or whether that's how she just is, I'm not sure.  But Grandma's opinion is that she's doing a wonderful job.  I love BF's mom.  I told him the other day that it's bad that he has such a good mom, cuz it makes me look like a horrible daughter.  Because I probably see more of her than my own mum.  I love how BF is so protective of me when it comes to my father.  He gets angry whenever the subject of him comes up.  We've talked vaguely about possible situations - like when lots of weddings were going on, we talked about things that might happen with our families.  I said I really didn't know what I would do about my father.  I don't think I'd want him there, but I don't know how easy it would be to just ignore the subject.  Sure, he doesn't talk to me anymore, but who's to say he wouldn't come out of the woodwork when he found out about an impending marriage?  Or even grandchildren?  BF says he wouldn't let my dad near me until he'd had it out with him.  And if my dad wouldn't have anything to do with him, then that would be it.  And it makes me smile to think he's protective of me.  And more recently, with the issue of grandparents and who's technically a grandparent, and who has the right to call themselves a grandparent.  Because this baby's grandma is grandpa's first wife.  He's on his third right now.  So does Wife #3 have a right to consider herself grandma?  Do Mom and Dad have a right to say, 'no, he's not going to call you grandma'?  Is it worth it to make it an issue?  Because now my dad has another wife.  I was talking with friends about this, and they asked me 'Would you consider Connie a grandma if you had kids?' and my immediate reaction was 'No."  She's had nothing to do with me, along with my dad.  And we were talking about this the other night, BF and I.  Because I said I was merely curious if a major event in my life - marriage, a baby, etc - would cause my father to come out of the woodwork.  And if he did, it would almost certainly be as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place.  If that were to happen, BF would be just as angry as me.  As he put it, 'He (my father) wasn't there for you - why on earth should he expect to be a part of a grandkid's life?'  Harsh words, some might think.  Life is short, don't hold a grudge, blahblahfreakinblah.  Exactly.  Well, obviously none of these things are about to happen anytime soon, so the point is moot.  For now.  So no use wondering what the future holds.  But it still makes me warm to see that display of protectiveness.  It makes me even more sure that he's someone I want to spend a long time with.

        It's A Boy!!      BF officially become an uncle yesterday, sometime in the morning . . . Lucas Ryan, a good solid name for a boy. =)  He was 7lb 3oz and 20-odd inches . . .   We still haven't seen him, figuring we'd give baby, mom and dad some time to themselves before we invaded their space!  We'll go visit them tonight.  What a lucky girl tho - only 3 hours of labour for her first baby!  Dad ended up missing his 4th-year (journeyman) final exam - talk about timing.  Wonder if it's an indication of times to come . . . =)  Wow . . . I know it's just a baby, and it's been coming for 9 months now, but I'm still in awe over it . . . I can't wait to see him later today.  Congratulations to the new parents!

Sure you do! =)  "Six White Boomers" (duh)  "lap dance speakeasy calgary" (sorry, buddy, I'm sure you were disappointed)  "calgary freak girl" (to each their own opinion, I guess)  "peter kitchin" (wow - I wonder who was looking for my uncle?)  "people overspend during christmas, bad or good?" (wow, whoever actually looks up full sentences like that needs to see their shrink a little more often)  OK, so nothing terribly interesting.  But I felt like sharing.  Feel more enlightened for it?

        Christmas Progress      Is everyone pretty much ready for Christmas at this point?  I don't think I ever am until Christmas Eve . . . and even then, some years it's a pinch.  We still don't have the tree up.  This makes me sad, but unfortunately it's pretty much my fault.  BF and Sunnyboy got the couch moved downstairs on Monday, but I had to work Monday night.  Last night, we still hadn't watched Bad Boys II that we'd rented on Sunday, and it wasn't over until just after 10pm.  And tonight, I have to work again.  Maybe tomorrow?  I sure hope so, because I have about 3-4 bags full of presents I want to put under there!  On the gift front, I was excited the other night to think that I only had 3 more people to take care of.  Then I get home to boast to BF, and he reminds me that there's still another 6 people I'd forgotten about.  All his family.  Oops.  My bad.  The credit card is running up towards the max, but I'm not going to stress a whole lot about it.  Hopefully next year I won't be so busy, so I can actually sit down and figure out how much we can/should be spending on people.  This year, it's pretty haphazard.  Enh, money comes and goes . . . just so long as I make sure it gets paid off in a coupla months and don't keep spending.  My second job should yield another impressive paycheque at the end of the month, so that helps, too.  You know, people rebel against the 'commercialism' of Christmas, and I agree to an extent.  But it'll happen throughout the year that I'll come across something that just begs to be bought as a gift for a friend/family member/SO.  So it's kinda like Christmas is a legit excuse to actually buy these things.  But then again, I do get somewhat miffed at the concept that we're expect to exchange gifts with certain people.  My biggest beef this year is BF's four half- and step-brothers.  They're all teenaged boys who are pretty much spoiled by their parents (remember his dad owns the refrigeration business?  yeah, they're his/his wife's kids).  Maybe because they're not my brothers, but my feeling is - they'll get pretty much everything or anything they want, so anything we get them it'll be like "Gee, thanks".  Is that bad of me?  But in the end, BF liked my suggestion of getting them the same thing I'm getting for my brothers.  Which is fine - it's only once a year.  And last year, he gave them IOUs for taking them to the shooting range but the year just kinda slipped by without ever following through on it.  So I suggested that if he's going to get them something this year, he should actually get something instead of promising something. =)  And now, just because it's never far from my mind . . . kittykittykittykittykittykitty . . . =)~

        The Decision's been made - now I can rest a little easier      After a brief period of consternation yesterday, I made up my mind.  I'll see if I can take a few extra holidays after Christmas (before New Years') so I can do some extra work, and I'll wait until the new year to give my notice.  This was all preceeded by speculation that  IF  we were getting a bonus, perhaps they were waiting until the Christmas party this Saturday to give them out.  And that makes a lot of sense.  But another factor was also the complication of the holidays.  I like a lot of the people I work with and wanted to be able to enjoy at least part of the Christmas party with them.  If I resigned before Christmas, there wouldn't be much chance of that.  I'm only obligated to give a weeks' notice, so I could just come back on Jan 5 and work my last week.  So what about taxes and whathaveyou . . . BF had a good point that, as a manager/president/etc, it would probably somewhat ruin the holidays to get someone's resignation just before Christmas.  Best to follow his example and wait til the new year.  So I feel much better having made this decision.  It's one less thing that needs to be taking up space in my brain.  Now, if only I could hear back from FRFA . . . I think I'm going to call them this morning.

       I seem to be on a tear these days.  Did I tell you I went to Spence Diamonds on Friday?  I finally told BF, just in case someone else told him and he got the wrong impression.  I just had an urge to look at all the sparkly rings.  I dragged my friend along so that she could have a good idea of my taste, you know,  just in case.   But really - I neither expect, nor really even want, one at the moment.  Maybe in a year.  Or when the time is right.  According to  urlLink this , it already  could  be the right time.  On a slightly different note, I ran into some good friends of ours when I was making my daily pit-stop at the petstore after work.  I found it rather amusing how the male half of the duo is just clueless when it comes to knowing us.  We exchanged the usual "Oh, hey!  What are you doing here?"  I said that I stopped by every night on my way home in the hopes that they might have some kittens for adoption.  Mr. B half-jokingly asked how many animals I thought BF would let me have in the house.  Which is kinda funny - Mr. B and BF are friends from before my time.  You'd think he'd know his friend.  BF had lots of pets around the house growing up.  In my defense, I stated that BF was all onboard for a kitten.  That he'd so much as been looking around without me in tow.  And Mrs. B chimed in that BF has become quite the cat person lately.  Mr. B's reply to that was along the lines of, "He's probably hoping that a kitten will distract you from wanting a baby."  From me: "I don't think BF is worried about me wanting a baby," as Mrs. B is shaking her head in agreement.  "Naw," she added, "Ang doesn't want a baby at the moment.  And when she gets the urge, she can steal ours or Sunny's."  Funny how a lot of women are much more in tune with people than men. =)

        Crossing the t's and Dotting the i's      Not like I really thought it was any different, but now it's just a matter of negotiation - agreeing what I'll be paid and any other little details.  I talked to my old supervisor last night, and the GM even popped in while I was there to assure me/us that he'd be willing to have 3 people in that position for the sake of getting things back on track.  Upon further discussion, it sounds a lot more reasonable - they'll keep the new guy on for another little while to see how it goes, and then determine if he fits or not.  I think they just don't want anyone threatened by my return, and possibly any lawsuits - completely understandable given the company's history with trouble from ex-employees.    But it sounds like they have the same impression as me - in a nutshell, that the new guy just doesn't have the common sense and attention to detail required for the job.  So yeah, all I really need to worry about is when to give my notice, and what on earth I'm going to say.  I read over the company's resignation policy, and I'm only required to give a weeks' notice if I've been here less than 2 years.  So I think I'll wait until Friday, that way maybe the impact is softened by the time I have to come in for work on Monday.  I'll work my 2 1/2 days left before Christmas, get paid out for my outstanding holidays, and if they want to refuse to pay me for the Christmas break (I've resigned myself to no pay for New Years'), I suppose that's their right.  I'm going to do my best not to burn any bridges.  Because I don't need that this early on in my career.  I'm going to be so nervous for the rest of the week - I hope it goes by fast.  But seeing as I'm seriously lacking in work to do again, it'll probably drag by.  Oh well.  I'll see if I can find any short-term projects to do in the meantime.  And on BF's employment front . . . I can't believe what he's putting up with at work for the sake of getting through the holidays and leaving in the best manner possible.  Maybe his boss/dad can sense that something is coming, I don't know.  But he's definitely crossing the lines of professionalism these days.  On Friday evening, it was a friend's birthday party.  BF used to work with the girl's husband until he quite a few months ago, and they also live down the street.  We're all pretty good friends and still hang out every coupla weeks.  So of course we would attend her surprise birthday party.  Apparently BF got his butt chewed out yesterday for this!  Apparently, because said friend's husband is an ex-employee, that he shouldn't be socializing with him.  That he has his priorities screwed up or something to that effect.  BF's attitude when he was telling me about this was "I just need to make it through the Christmas season."  Wow, he's strong.  I can't imagine what on earth is going through his dad's head to be saying these things, especially on the job.  As a boss - and even as a dad, for that matter - how on earth is it his business what an employee (or his son) does on his personal time, or who he associates with?    It isn't!    My only comment just before we fell asleep was - "Well, hopefully we'll both be much happier after Christmas."  And hopefully a cute little ball of fur to come home to will help relieve stress in the meantime. =)  Except that we still haven't heard a peep from  urlLink FRFA .  Maybe by the weekend.  I know most of them are volunteers who have day jobs, so I've got to be patient.  It never rains but pours, huh? =)

        Mixed News      Sadly, nothing about my job situation has been figured out for sure yet.  And it makes me nervous, because 2-weeks' notice for the end of the year is Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  And I'm stressing about what I'm going to say to the people here, and how it's going to be received.  But I did get some rather exciting news this morning . . . I'm not supposed to know, but apparently the GM at the old job has instructed my old supervisor to "pay her whatever it takes" to get me back.  That's more like it.  I feel kinda spoiled, actually.  I don't want to get cocky, because I know what happens to people when they get that kind of attitude.  I don't want to be greedy, but it needs to be worth my while to be leaving a pretty good job after only 7 months.  The mixed news?  There's talk of keeping the new guy as well.  First of all, that poses all sorts of problems - #1, there's a serious lack of office space as it is (with only 1 extra person, let alone 2).  #2, they'd have to buy another computer, as well as licenses for the software, which is NOT cheap.  #3, neither me nor my friend currently in the position can stand him.  That sounds really bad, but he's very frustrating to work with.  I just don't see how it makes any business sense to keep him around when he's only adding to the workload, and it's already been a month or so since he started.  My friend was already working alone after only a week of training.  And on another note, I don't see why he's doing this kind of work when he's technically qualified to do an engineer's job.  I just think it would be better for all if he was doing work he'd be good at, instead of struggling (and causing much frustration) with something he isn't.  Is that wrong of me?  I just don't think I'd be anywhere near as excited about this change if it means he's still going to be around.   Especially  given the nature of the work - sure, it's busy right now, but when I left 7 months ago, we'd all literally been sitting around for 3 weeks.  And for most of the time I was there, the work was just enough to keep one person steadily busy.  OK, I'll let go of that one for now before I start a rant. =)  So - I'm hoping this finally happens this afternoon!  I've had to lie and say I have a doctor's appointment, so I'm leaving work at 3:30pm.  I hate lying.  It always seems to catch up with me somehow.  And now a co-worker (and friend) is possibly leaving as well.  I didn't really feel guilty about handing in my notice, because I don't feel like I really contribute much in the first place.  But now that she's possibly leaving as well . . . man, THAT gap would certainly be felt.  Guilty, guilty, guilty.  Must be the Catholic upbringing. =)  And I am   SO   unreasonably curious to find out what on earth this much-gossiped about bonus is going to be.  Supposedly this afternoon.  Hope I don't miss it by leaving early.  Wow, I really hate waiting.

        Obsessions    For the next couple of weeks, my mind will be completely occupied by 3 things, and probably never all 3 at once (I'm not much good at that multi-tasking thing):  - if changing jobs is going to happen (and what I'm going to say if I leave this one) - a kitten - Christmas  The first one will be sorted out, change or not, probably by later today.  The second one, who knows?  There are certain requirements - like a kitten who is around 8 weeks old, female, and likes BF.  I could just come home with one, but cats either love or hate BF.  I wouldn't want to adopt one only to get her home and find out she hates BF.  And the last one, well, if you don't know when that one will be over, you need help.  I've still got a fair amount of Christmas shopping to do, and I've already spent too much money.  Not too much in the sense that we'll be going hungry or anything, or that bills won't get paid, just that I may not be able to pay the whole amount off on January 1.  Enh, these things happen.  Hopefully it's the last year.  And you never know - even though I've heard the word 'small' in the same sentence referring to our bonus, I could get a pleasant surprise.  If not, the world won't stop turning.  Speaking of Christmas shopping . . . it's amazing how two peoples' ideas of what makes a good gift can differ so greatly.  At Walmart, I saw this really cute children's Pooh chair and table.  We have 3 friends/family having babies in the next few months, so I figured surely they'd be a good gift for one of them?  I mention it to BF, and he makes this funny 'what-are-YOU-on?' face.  Apparently he thinks it's very  gauche  (obviously my word, not his) to give gifts for a baby when it's not born yet.  I never would have thought of that.  So he's been told he has to be with me when we get gifts for his family, or at least have input.  My brothers were easy to shop for - I cheated and did theirs online this year.  Less than 3 minutes for 3 brothers, baby.  BF was, of course, easy to shop for.  The hard part is remembering what I've gotten so I don't overspend.  Single friends are done, coupled friends I still need to check if they had planned on a no-gift-exchange Christmas.  Mum is hard for once.  It seems like several years in a row, I've gotten her spa gift certificates or something she's specifically asked for.  I don't to be monotonous, but she hasn't mentioned anything yet this year.  And BF's family I'm leaving up to him.  Gotta love the holidays.

       I want a kitten.  I think I've become obsessed.  I'll probably stop at the petstore again on my way home tonight.  Pictures like these   don't help my cause.  People say to me, "Kittens become cats eventually, you know."  Duh.  Like I don't know that.  I've adopted one cat as almost full grown, and two as 8-week-old kittens.  I don't mind that it'll eventually be a cat - I love cats.  I just want to have that kitten phase again.  And I'd willingly go through the puppy thing again, too.  But only if I knew there was no chance of having to give him up again.  Maybe I'm weird.  Maybe my 'biological clock' is ticking in a weird way such that pets will satisfy me for now.  Who knows.  Or maybe I just feel like my life needs more animals in it.  We're going to need a bigger house soon.  But I like this one for now.  It's plenty big enough for another cat, and perhaps a dog a little later on.  I want to make it our own before we think of parting with it.  It still needs a lot of work.  I want to be able to have my 'me' time (read: gym/swimming/etc) but not feel like it's taking away from 'us' time and 'home' time.  Yes, the old job would allow me that.  Don'tcha just love my segue?  So, tomorrow I'll talk with my old boss, and we'll see what happens from there.

        An Update      I was waffling yesterday after going out to the field yet again . . . wondering if 'moving backwards' was such a good idea.  But now I'm back in the office again, and it makes the decision easier.  Still the guilt is going to take a while to get over.  And another sucky thing - I would need to hand in my notice a week from tomorrow, since the end of the year seems as good a time as any.  But the company Christmas party is on the 20th (2 days later) . . . hmmm, somehow I don't think I'll be going . . .

        Addicted to Chaos?      I'm starting to wonder.  I'll be brief for now, since CSI: Miami is on in about 5 minutes, and it's like an institution in my house. =)  It seems I'm not destined for a stable life.  Just when I think things might finally be settling down for a while, something comes along.  Thank goodness it wasn't one of those 'oopsy-daisy' things . . .   One of my old co-workers has successfully made me think seriously about returning to my old job.  I made it very clear to him that I didn't think the GM would pay me what I would ask for, and listed a few other things that would be really hard to part with from my new job, but he said that he was pretty sure they'd do basically anything to have me back.  It's nice to feel wanted.  It's nice to have leverage, too. =)  But I'm not evil.  I'll work out what the RRSP-matching, pension plan, and better benefit plan would work out to in dollars, give them a high number, and negotiate from there.  But I truly think I'd be much less stressed out and probably a lot happier at my old job.  And I'd get to work with my friend!  Some would say that's not a good thing, but having already developed a work-environment relationship with her, I think it would be all good.  So long as we still make sure we go out as friends occasionally instead of always being co-workers!  *sigh*  We could get a puppy and actually keep him sometime in late spring!  It wouldn't be as much of a struggle to find time to work out.  It would be so much better.  So I think I'll zip off an email to my old boss and get the ball rolling . . .     Completely unrelated - I think I'm wearing BF down on the idea of a kitten.  I actually got him to go to the pet store with me on Sunday, but sadly the kittens had gone back to their foster homes. =(  On that same topic, I think it would be really funny to get some cheesy Christmas cards, and if we got a new kitten, to say something like, "Introducing the newest member of our family . . . " and have a picture of the kitten inside.  I know a lot of people who would freak out over that, thinking it's a baby . . . =)~  Anyways, I've just been informed that CSI: Miami is officially on . . . til next time!

        Road Rules of Etiquette    Especially applicable for Calgary drivers!!    After a few too many frustrating drives lately, I thought I would take it upon myself to provide some rules of etiquette when it comes to driving.  Maybe I'll submit them to the AMA to include as part of their driving courses.  1.  There's a reason for the term 'Sunday Drivers.'  You have no place being on the road at 7am on a Tuesday morning.  2.  Just because you pay your share of taxes DOES NOT give you the right to go 60km/h in the lefthand lane down Glenmore Trail when the speed limit is 80km/h.  It does, however, give me the right to honk at you and gesture as I please.  3.  Same goes for doing 90km/h in the fast lane on the Deerfoot.  It's called the fast lane for a reason.  4.  Another one for Glenmore drivers . . . everyone knows that the 2 righthand lanes back up for the Deerfoot turnoff.  Don't be a jerk and sail down the lefthand lane only to stop dead and hold up traffic cuz you can't get into the turnoff lane at the last second.  5.  Yes, semis are a pain in the butt.  Especially at 6:45am.  But if you're going to pull out from behind one, into traffic that is going the speed limit, DO THE SPEED LIMIT.  6.  Every single car comes equipped with turning signals.  USE THEM.  And shut them off once you're done.  7.  Construction crews give you plenty of warning if a lane is being pinched out.  In case you have trouble interpreting these signs, they mean 'GET OUT OF THIS LANE AS SOON AS YOU CAN' not 'Be an ass and drive right up to the last possible second so that some poor sap has to slam on his brakes to let you in.'  Cuz if that poor sap is me, you can be sure I will let you scrape my car before I make space for you.  8.  Don't tailgate someone who is already speeding.  If I'm going 90km/h in an 80 zone, and you come roaring up behind me, I'll slow down to 80 just to piss you off.  70 - or the speed of the car beside me - if I'm already in a bad mood.  9.  You're not going to get home any faster by pulling up right behind the car that's only barely through the intersection.  I could go on and on and on and on . . . instead, go check out what  urlLink Katie  did that I wish I had the guts to do more often.  Cuz all these rules go double for anyone in one of those ridiculously huge SUVs.  In fact, you should have to get a special license to drive those things.

       The hot tub arrives tonight.  I'm suddenly dreading this.  We're going to have to clear the backyard - I'm worried the guy's gonna have a problem and say our backyard isn't level enough, or the path is no good or something.  We're gonna need some kind of carpetting so people can get from the house to the hottub in bare feet.  BF's invited a whole bunch of people - everyone from his work, some of our neighbours, and our close friends.  Neither of us has any idea how many people are actually gonna show up on Saturday night.  And as far as I know, we haven't told anyone what time to start coming over.  I think it would be nice to go for dinner first, since it  is  for a birthday - but if he doesn't know what time people are going to be over, BF won't want to leave the house at all.  He's just like that.  And really - how entertaining is it going to be to jump in and out of a hottub every 20-30 mins or so?  There's gonna be wet people in swimsuits in the house - how comfortable is THAT going to be?  I don't know if I want to be wandering around in a swimsuit, much less a wet one . . . what are the non-hottubing people gonna do?  We have 2 pregnant friends who won't be getting wet - they're gonna be bored.  I'm just not much of a hostess.  BF and I are so opposite in many ways, and this is just one of them.  He loves having people over, loves play the host . . . I couldn't hate it more.  Just one more thing for me to stress out about.  And I was all for this just a week ago - in fact, I think it was my idea to begin with!  I don't think it would be so bad if we had an actual backyard with a fence, maybe a deck, and a house better-equipped for guests.  *sigh*  Such goes the coupled life.  Or maybe it's just me cuz I can be so fickle.  Ohhh, I just had an idea.  I should swing by my mum's . . . my youngest brother said I could have their N64, and then I could rent Mario Party 4 . . . I love that game.  At least then, up to 4 people can be playing that.  There's an idea.  Anybody out there been to a hot tub party before?  What on earth did you do besides drink and jump in and out of the tub?  I've never been to one before, so I have no idea . . .

      I wonder - should my font be bigger?  I mean, women usually obsess over whether or not things should be smaller, or at the very least, they obsess over  how  to make them smaller.  No, I'm worried it should be bigger.  Any feedback?  ( . . . . . echo . . . . . )  ( . . . . . echo . . . . . )  ( . . . . . echo . . . . . )  Well, that would explain a lot.

             you are lightcyan  #E0FFFF         Your dominant hues are green and blue. You're smart and you know it, and want to use your power to help people and relate to others. Even though you tend to battle with yourself, you solve other people's conflicts well.  Your saturation level is very low - you have better things to do than jump headfirst into every little project. You make sure your actions are going to really accomplish something before you start because you hate wasting energy making everyone else think you're working.  Your outlook on life is very bright. You are sunny and optimistic about life and others find it very encouraging, but remember to tone it down if you sense irritation.        urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz         Hmm . . . very interesting.  That 'tend to battle with yourself' is so bang on . . . did you know I'll have arguments with myself when I'm driving?

        My Favorite Christmas Song     My absolute favorite Christmas song has got to be 'Six White Boomers'.  Actually, I think the feeling comes partly from the sheer delight that crosses my mum's face when the song comes on.  But it's just so different from everything else out there . . .   So, just because it's my blog and I feel like it, I'm swiping the lyrics and putting them here.  Then I can come back anytime I want and sing it in my head . . . =)   Six White Boomers   Early on one Christmas Day a Joey kangaroo, Was far from home and lost in a great big zoo. 'Mummy, where's my mummy?  They've taken her away!' 'We'll help you find your mummy, son.  Hop up on the sleigh.'  Up beside the bag of toys little Joey hopped, But they hadn't gone far when Santa stopped. Unharnessed all the reindeer and Joey wondered why, Then he heard a faroff booming in the sky.   Six white boomers, snow white boomers, Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun, Six white boomers, snow white boomers, On his Australian run.   Pretty soon old Santa began to feel the heat, Took his fur-lined boots off to cool his feet, Into one popped Joey, feeling quite okay, While those old man Kangaroos kept pulling on the sleigh.   Six white boomers, snow white boomers, Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun, Six white boomers, snow white boomers, On his Australian run.   Joey said to Santa, 'Santa, what about the toys? Aren't you giving some to these girls and boys?' 'They've got all their presents, son, we were here last night, this trip is an extra trip - Joey's special flight.'   Six white boomers, snow white boomers, Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun, Six white boomers, snow white boomers, On his Australian run.   Soon the sleigh was flashing past right over Marble Bar, 'Slow down there,' cried Santa, 'it can't be far. Come up on my lap here, son, and have a look around.' 'There she is, that's mummy, bounding up and down.'   Six white boomers, snow white boomers, Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun, Six white boomers, snow white boomers, On his Australian run.   Well that's the bestest Christmas treat that Joey ever had, Curled up in his mother's pouch feeling snug and glad. The last they saw was Santa heading northward from the sun, The only year the boomers worked a double run.   Six white boomers, snow white boomers, Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun, Six white boomers, snow white boomers, On his Australian run.

        The Dreaded Christmas Parties are Upon Us     Ahhh, the lovely Christmas season.  Too much shopping, too many parties, too much drinking, too much being fake, too much to do, and no where  near  enough time for it all.  I think the worst part is the Christmas parties.  Especially the company ones.  Some are great  BFs company one was this past weekend.  A fancy dinner, with dancing and booze and a hotel room in Banff are all paid for.  And for a few, a special rate on an extra night at the hotel.  We went up to Banff on Friday this year, wanting to take advantage of the opportunity and hopefully not be as stressed out as last year.  All was good on Friday.  We got up to Banff, and the weather was perfect  only about minus 2C with plenty of big white flakes falling.  BF did his Starbucks inspection in less than half the time expected, we checked in leisurely, and had a leisurely dinner at the Old Spaghetti Factory.  Service in a small town is just so much better than in the big city.  We joined up with some other early-arrivers for drinks and had a fun night, but not letting loose completely in anticipation of the real party on Saturday night.  I had these big plans to make use of the Banff Centre facilities and either workout or go for a swim sometime on Saturday.  I mean, the dinner wasnt until 6pm, that should be plenty of time, right?  We got up leisurely, had another leisurely meal, and then remembered about the requisite socializing at the RosenCrown at 1pm.  For some stupid reason, I was still stuck on this whole idea with working out, and left the pub after a half-hour.  By the time I got back to the Banff Centre, found my swimsuit, and hemmed and hawed over whether to swim or workout, it was 2:30pm . . . and then I wandered all over trying to find the entrance to the swimming pool that was taunting me just up the hill from the sidewalk.  When all was said and done, I returned to the room in a huff and took a bath . . . I could have simply stayed at the pub, relaxed and socialized for another hour.  Uh oh.  Bad start.  Thats what I hate the most about these parties  the feeling of needing to look your absolute best.  Which usually involves at least a couple of hours of frustration, fussing and sometimes a few tears.  Well, for me anyways.  And then, youre rarely comfortable during the party itself, because dresses have this sneaky way of looking oh-so-good in the change room, and then mysteriously tightening  justthismuch  on the night of the party.  Or youre blissfully unaware of that glaring bulge or roll in the change room, only to have it screaming for attention in the bathroom mirror once its too late to change your mind.  Last year, my car broke down, I forgot my shoes and camera, my hair wouldnt work right, and my dress was uncomfortably snug.  In addition, I left my chapstick behind in the hotel room which made me miserable all night long.  So I thought I would be smarter this year.  We went up a day early, I was pretty sure Id thought of everything I could possibly need, the dress was a stretchy-cottony type of material, and I had my shoes.  I was going to forego fussing with my hair, because I get compliments even when its just curled and left loose, and I like it that way.  What could possibly go wrong?  The fabulous dress strikes again.  It was a style definitely meant for smaller/skinnier/less-endowed girls.  I thought it looked great in the change room, but I was still wearing a bra then, and duct tape definitely had no hiding place.  Plus, I felt naked.  Plus, once the party started rolling, the alcohol was doing nothing for me.  Ever had that?  Where you're anticipating a party thats going to involve drinking, and its almost like just because you  expect  that youre going to get drunk, you cant?  Thats how it was . . . I didnt have lots to drink, but I wasnt even getting a buzz, and my stomach started protesting after only 3-4 drinks.  Lovely.  Meanwhile, BF is having a grand old time, drinking and socializing away, leaving me alone at the table for much of the night.  He never means to leave me alone  Im a big girl, I can take care of myself and know most of the people there, and hes just a social kinda guy.  But between that and not being able to get drunk I was kinda miserable.  Then we got kicked out of the hall, and tradition states that the real partiers congregate in the bosss room to continue drinking.  I missed out last year, and BF stayed behind with me.  This year, I was miserable again, not seeing the point in pretending to drink with other drunk people.  But I wasnt going to make BF stay behind too.  I was asleep sometime around 2am, and found out the next morning that BF didn't crawl into bed until after 4am.  You can be pretty oblivious in a king-sized bed.  Now, had this just been an impromptu gathering of friends, with me in comfortable clothes and drinking just cuz it tasted good, I probably would have had a blast and gone home plastered and happy (and had spectacular drunken sex, too, but shhhhh, I didnt say that).  Im very tempted to claim a family commitment to get out of MY company party.  I dont need another reason to be miserable for the sake of posterity, especially when there are so many other reasons to be stressed out at this time of year.

        Swimming Rocks, Baby!      And I'd forgotten how much until Monday night.  Gotta love that  satisfying  burn and sheer exhaustion that comes after a hard workout.  The gym just can't do it for me - only swimming can.  Except for being severely out of shape, being in the water that night was like I'd never stopped going to practice.  We'll see if I'm singing the same song after practice tonight (given the fact that my muscles are still aching from Monday) . . . but I think I'm going to love this program.  And I'm going to be incredibly sad when it's over.  In other news - I was right about my co-worker's baby being a girl!  That made me feel kinda proud . . . maybe I'll be right about the next one being a boy?  Boy or girl, he/she sure is taking their sweet time in making their appearance.  Hopefully he comes on his own within the next week . . . I'm sure future mom and dad are getting anxious for it to be over with!  I know for me that waiting is the hardest part of anything . . .   Well, busy busy these days, not much time to write.  Now I'm off to swim practice #2!  Wish me luck in not drowning tonight . . . =)

        In The Air Tonight?      It's coming soon.  Two of our good friends are going to be parents any day now.  And at the same time, a friend from the old job is expecting an arrival any day now, too.  I went over to visit the first friend yesterday.  I had business nearby, and knew she was going out of her mind with boredom since being on mat leave.  And a small part of me wondered if I might be needed in some capacity.  Luckily, no, I wasn't needed, but the company was sure appreciated.  I got to see the baby's room all set up, and there are so many cute things in there.  There's a fairly strong theme of blue, and I think it's great because I'm convinced it's going to be a boy.  No good reason, just a conviction of mine.  And blue is just a great colour in general.  Of course, knowing Murphy's law, now that the room is mostly blue, it'll be a girl. =)  I think they're going to make excellent parents, and I'm looking forward to watching this little one grow up.  And of course, I would never forget about Lukas!  So many little ones . . .

        What Goes Around, Comes Around      So all I can think of is that I must have been Hitler or something in a past life.  Cuz I don't know what I've done to deserve this.  Yes, I need to rant, and rant something horrible.  But I'm at work, so this is about the best I can do.  Two weeks ago, on my last day of work at the old job, the painter was FINALLY supposed to show up to do touchups around the house - after standing me up before Christmas.  I was not a happy camper to begin with.  He was sitting in his truck in front of my house when I pulled up.  As I approached, he pulled forward - so, of course, I pulled in behind him to park in front of my house.  I was just parking when his reverse lights went on and he plowed straight into my car.  Pretty darn cut and dried - he hit my car.  I was stationary.  He got out, and said "Sorry about your car.  You must have snuck up on me there."  I didn't say a word.  I was livid.  I checked out my car, and it wasn't too bad, but the bra was cracked, as well as the front bumper and grill.  He was driving an '84 GMC pickup - there wasn't even any paint transfer.  I still hadn't said anything by the time we got in the house, and it only made me madder that he reeked of smoke and he was making the house smell bad.  I said I'd get his insurance information after he'd done with the painting, and showed him all the spots around the house.  After going out to his truck for his tools, he said I might as well take it down while he was working to save time.  Of course, first thing I do when he's out of earshot is frantically call BF.  I'm absolutely horrible at dealing with situations like this, and after nearly being screwed one too many times, I wanted to make sure I didn't get shafted because I was too nice.  My car was the only one with any damage, and it wasn't even my fault, so I was the only one with something to lose.  BF said to make sure I got his insurance info (duh - but sometimes my brain goes numb), to go file a police report as soon as he was gone, and to even go down to the builder's showhomes down the street just to make sure they knew about it.  I got his insurance info, and called them as soon as he was gone.  I called the police to find out which district I was in, but they don't like to have reports filed for less than $1000 damage.  So I just talked to a constable about who would likely be found at fault.  She was really nice to me, but gave me the truth - if he was reversing, he was at fault.  But because there were no witnesses, it was his word against mine as far as insurance was concerned, and if he decided to lie and say he wasn't moving, it might end up being a 50-50 case.  I got pictures of my car and couldn't do much else, seeing as it was the weekend.  On Monday, my car was booked in for an oil change anyways, so I had them do an estimate at the same time.  $922 worth of damage, and it's barely visible.  But not quite $1000, so I didn't think I'd get a warm reception if I tried to file a police report, just so my version was down on paper.  I called my insurance company just to make a record of it, and she gave me a more positive outlook - well, he's at fault because he was backing up at the time.  So I felt a little better.  Let it go a week without hearing anything before I started to get concerned and called his insurance rep back.  She said that he hadn't given them a statement yet, but the version he gave to his broker suggested he didn't think he was at fault.  That I could call my insurance company and have them deal with it, or wait until he gave them a statement.  Then yesterday, I got home to find a message from this same lady.  He claims it wasn't his fault, so there wasn't anything more she could do.  Call my own insurance rep and have them deal with it.  I called her back today, absolutely livid, to find out exactly what he was saying.  He is now claiming that   I   ran into   his   car!!  That I just pulled up in too much of a hurry and hit the back of his truck.  I was dumbfounded.  She said again that there was nothing more she could do, and to have my insurance company deal with it.  Well, why should I have to file a claim and take a hit on my insurance just because he's a fuckin dumbass and a liar to boot?  I don't think so.  So I called his work.  I wasn't really sure what I was going to say, but figured I'd at least get his phone number.  I had to try really hard not to be bitchy, because I'd dealt with the receptionist/dispatcher before, and I knew this wasn't her problem nor did it involve her.  I asked to have his number because I didn't get any contact information when the accident happened.  She was apologetic, but said she'd been specifically instructed not to give out any information.  I couldn't let it go at that.  I let her know that I was extremely upset, because he was now lying about the accident and I wanted to be able to speak with him directly.  I asked if I could speak to his boss instead, and now I'm just waiting for a phone call.  Do I have an invisible sign on my car that says "Hit me, then take advantage of the situation"??  Cuz I'm sure starting to wonder.  When it was the Dodge, I figured maybe it was just that particular car.  But now I'm having the same luck with a brand new car, so I can only wonder if it's something to do with me.  I want to beat up that fat, dumbass old man of a painter for being a liar and making my life difficult.  I suppose it could be worse . . . someone could have smashed up my car while I wasn't around, and I wouldn't even have anyone to blame.  But it still burns my noodle that there are such dishonest people out there.  Don't mess with me, mean people, because I'm quickly learning from BF how to cause a stink when you've done me wrong.

        Wow, there are so many obsticales when you try and blog drunk.  Even mostly drunk but almost recovering.  Holy shit, I dont' know if i even make sense.  Who carex.  i don't think i've made sense all night long - why start now?  I fainlly got a long-deserved girls' night out.  i alsmot didn't go - and i'm really sorry to robyn cuz i never called you back.  we didn't leave the keg until nearly 12:30am, and i figured you were long past going out then.  big huge apologies to you, and i will definitely make it up to you sometime.  yay, girls' night out rocks.  you get drunk - and might i add a very happyu drunk, except that now bf is so far passed out on the couch and i have no idea if he's made at me or just tired or what, but there's no hjaving my way with him on the couch so i had my way with myself.  i think i know why people regret drunken bloggin now.  it's not a good idea.  but hey, i've done a few things tonight that weren't such a good idea, and i had fun, so hey, whjy not?  damn tho . . . i've really lost it..  girl's night out, especially among mostly-married girls is supposed to be a reaffirmation of 'having it.'  you know what i mean.  you wanna know that you've still got it - that other men are still attracted to you.  tnoight was not exactly successfull.  i swear i musta been the 'fat uigly friend' tonight.  that sucks.  anyways, maybe i should get some sleep before the full realization of tonight hits me - with a headache and a desire to visit the porcelain throne.  let's hope not.  here's to drunken blogging - something i dont' think i've done yet - and an extra one on me for anyone not having a good night out there.  life is good.

        Jumping on the Bandwagon      'Oh ho, the Wells Fargo wagon is a-comin' down the street Oh please let it be for me . . .'  Don't ask.  OK, ask.  I was part of The Music Man in high school.  There.  But it has nothing to do with my post.  "Bandwagon" just makes me think of that song.  How can you tell it's a boring day?  I've been catching up on reading blogs since coming back to the boring job, and I realized something - it's a new year.  Sure, I went to the party and everything, but I never really thought about the implications.  So - since I have nothing better to do for now, I figured I'd jump on the whole reflection/resolution bandwagon.  Don't worry, I'll refrain from quoting The Music Man again . . .   I was looking back on entries from December and January of last year, and I'm reminded of the drama I felt at the time.  I was having endless crises involving my car, my living situation was in upheaval, and life in general felt like a big soap opera.  It might seem like this year has started out in a similar fashion, but unlike last year - where the drama had no definite end in sight - this year I know it has an end, and that makes it much easier to handle.  I know that, once the job transition is over, things will settle down once again.  Last year, at this time, I was in awe of all the changes 2002 had brought for me.  All the firsts, all the dramas, all the achievements, all the good and the bad.  2003 hasn't been much different.  I've been nothing but tickled pink with the new car, officially moved in with the BF, soon after bought our first house together, adopted a dog only to give him up a few months later, changed jobs (only to realize the first job was a better fit), and had some close friends and family start families of their own.  As much as these events have been mostly good, I really hope 2004 is a year of stability for me.  I don't want my career situation to change for at least another couple of years.  I don't want to move.  I just want to make my house more homey, maybe add some more pets to our little unofficial family, and generally have life settle down.  Not  settle down  settle down, in the common negative sense, just settle down as in a lack of upheaval.  Cuz I'm a much better girlfriend, cat-mom, and friend when I'm not distracted by stress.  I need to mention that I hate resolutions.  I think they're retarded (for lack of motivation to find a more sophisticated word).  And that seems to be a common thing among the people I talk to and those whose blogs I frequent.    And I   HATE   those bloody New-Years'-Resolutioners at the gym.  This year, my resolution just happens to coincide with the new year.  But it's the same resolution I've had since the fall - I just got sidetracked due to having a second job and whatnot.  Now I won't have two jobs, and I'll have plenty of time to go to the gym.  But my initial efforts will likely be hampered by a crowded gym where my favorite machines are constantly in use by people who probably won't last past Valentine's Day.  At the very least, I'll have my swimming program.  I'm getting pretty excited about that.  January 26 will see me half-drowning after dinner, but by mark my words - by Valentine's Day, I'll be a regular fish again.  So, these are my hopes/goals (NOT resolutions!) for 2004: - a fitter, healthier, slimmer (and happier!) me - no changes in job - no new home - an improved current home - with a garage, a deck, a fenced yard with grass, and a more organized basement - more financial stability, in the form of no credit card debt  And that's the end of my bandwagon-jumping for now.

        Pep Talk To Myself      I need to reassure myself that I've made the right decision.  I've just come out of my exit interview, and I almost feel like crying.  I need to remind myself of the reasons I made this decision in the first place, because now I'm doubting myself.  I know it's just an emotional response, and logically I know I've given it a lot of thought so therefore I must have made the right decision.  But when you get told outright that someone's very disappointed that you're leaving, because they've been happy with your work and found you to be bright . . . well, it's hard not to have an emotional response to that.  I know I've made the right decision.  It bothers me endlessly to come into work not knowing if people are going to have time to give me things to do, and it makes me feel guilty and useless to spend my days playing games and blogging and surfing the internet.  But oh man, I'm sure with the drilling program underway that they would have found more things for me to do.  No matter . . . a month later I would probably be in the same position of being bored again.  The hours here aren't flexible, and I dislike feeling like a child because I have to get approval for everything.  I don't like taking the train, and to boot, I've been sick far more often since working downtown.  I get migraines fairly often, and I get stressed out - neither of which was really a problem at the old job.  So why don't I feel any better yet?  What if I get restless again?  Will I be able to deal with it better than last time, when I quit and got this job?  I'm tired of changing jobs all the time, and this one has been particularly stressful to me.  Think of the summer . . . when the days get longer, and warmer, and instead of being stuck downtown from 7:30 to 5pm, you can be out.  The work will likely ease up, and you can take courses, and likely work shorter hours.  You'll have time to work out, which will definitely make you feel better.  You'll have time to visit with the new little people in your life.  You'll be less stressed out when you come home at night.  OK, I think that's helped.

        Funny That, Huh?     Funny how I go through my cycles with blogging.  Seems that when I'm more social, I don't feel as much a need to write.  And why would I?  I've got plenty of people to talk to.  Between working at the second job while on holidays for the first, and going to parties, and visiting with people, there's just barely enough time to hang out with BF and veg to feel normal.  And besides that, I feel like any news I've had I've told to about a dozen people in a dozen different versions, so it loses something by the time I get here.  Sorry to the few of you that still read. =)  I'm excited about changing jobs.  Absolutely dreading Monday, when I have to give notice at the current job, but I've been so busy working at the 'old' job this past week it's been easy to forget.  And it feels really good to be with my old co-workers this past week.  Christmas was hectic.  Family here, family there.  Gotta make sure everyone gets a visit.  Christmas Eve was torture - little Lukas was there the whole night at both stops, but because it was mostly family that won't get to see him on a regular basis, I couldn't really ask to hold him.  And by the end of the night,  Mom had that protective 'leave us alone now' look.  It wasn't that hard to interpret. =)  And Christmas Day dinner was spent indoctrinating BF into the little dramas that make up my family. =)  Sadly, my little bro - the person I most looked forward to seeing - made his excuses for not going.  It was still great seeing my two aunts and uncles, along with my papa, mum and middle bro.  New Years' Eve was fun, too.  A little less eventful than last year, but good times nonetheless.  Once or twice I heard "I miss Shari", but that's completely understandable.  I hope our little tradition of gathering at the snewton household doesn't end with the beginning of families.  I'm so excited about the next two babies to come.  Well, not much else to tell.  I'm addicted to playing Showdown Solitaire when I have someone to play with, Pogo games when I don't, and listening to my new Evanescence CD.  So that's what I'm off to do.

        More Random Thoughts       The lingering effects of Valentine's Day.   I love my boyfriend.  But lately, I seem to get bitter from time to time.  I don't know if it's justified, or if I just have unrealistic expectations.  But I still get bitter.  I hate Valentine's Day.  Hate the commercialism, anyways.  Don't care to make reservations to eat in an overcrowded restaurant just to say I had a date on Valentine's Day.  Don't care to be made to feel like I have to buy a gift, or a cheesy card, or make some contrived gesture of affection.  Those things are better left for spur-of-the-moment when a genuine emotion strikes.  And I'd like to think I do that.  Get up early one day to make breakfast before work.  Take a few extra moments another day to make him lunch before work.  Go out of my way after work to pick up some Pepsi, cuz I know how much he enjoys it and I also know that we've been out for a few days.  Volunteer the idea of a hot tub party cuz he's had some shitty birthday parties in the past.  You know, little things to show I'm thinking about him.  That he's important to me, that I want him to be happy.  Maybe I'm blind.  Maybe he does things and I just don't see them for what they are.  But every now and then, when I start to get bitter, I think pretty hard, look pretty closely.  I don't see a lot.  He'll plan for months to save up for a gun, a tattoo, a toy.  Any trips or special occasions are planned and instigated by me.  And see - I get bitter.  I hate being bitter, because I like being happy.  I like how people like being around me when I'm happy.  Anyways.   Babies.   Babies, babies, babies.  What more can I say?  For 18 years, they were strange, foreign beings to me, and all of a sudden, even three aren't enough to keep me happy.  I can't get enough of them.  Two in particular are special to me, and I've been strictly informed that I am NEVER to have a favorite.  No problemo.  They're all my favorites. =)  People ask me all the time, "So when are you going to have one, then?"  Are you kidding?  I have things perfectly right now:  I get to be happy and excited to see them, maybe some day they'll think I'm cool (cuz I'm not Mom), and I get to go home by myself and still be excited to see them the next time.  I can afford to buy all the cool toys and cute outfits for no reason.  And - because, of course, I plan on having some ONE DAY - I get to learn!  Even better than Mom's advice is to actually see a friend go through it, see what works and what doesn't, see the little things nobody thinks to tell you until after it happens.  I'd like to pay off a few more debts, afford a bigger house with a real yard, and have the option to say, "Honey, I think I'd like to stay home after this year is up."  And I'd like to be married first, and not worry that the father-to-be isn't as thrilled as I am.  I'm too selfish right now, but give me a coupla years.  You know, my mum was married shortly at 26, first child (me!) at 27.  It startled me the other day to realize that I'm now almost 25 myself . . . and that, if things keep heading down this path, I may follow a similar timeline.  But there's always the "who knows?" clause.  And that's what keeps things interesting.  I won't always be bitter.  Just until BF catches on that something's wrong, coaxes me into talking, and asks what he can do to make it better.  Cuz if things really  were  bad, you know I wouldn't still be here.  Obviously something keeps me around, I just forget that sometimes.   Friends.   They're constantly shifting.  I enjoy seeing more of people I didn't a year ago, and not simply because of the baby incentive (even tho they tease me to the contrary).  People I swore I'd make regular time for have almost fallen off the charts.  Not out of malice, not on purpose, things just change.  Well, it's Friday night, and it's time for some much-needed socializing.  Hope you all have a great weekend!  All . . . two? . . . of you?  I think I'm optimistic . . . =)

        It's a Baby Bonanza, Folks!!      I got a rather shocking (to me, at least - BF claims to have expected it) phone call last night.  There's another baby in the world!  The next little one - who wasn't due for another 4 to 5 weeks - made his appearance yesterday evening.  Despite being early, it sounds like he's a fairly healthy 5lbs 3 oz, and most importantly, breathing on his own.  I guess they decided that his mom's blood pressure was getting too high to risk it any longer.  I don't know much at this point except mom is probably pretty rough, and the as-yet-nameless baby is doing OK.  BF's happy that he has another boy to corrupt.  As he put it, "I'm glad at least C has a boy.  Girls aren't really my specialty."  And with two boys, his secret ambition of eventually being known as "Uncle Pixie-Sticks" stands a better chance of coming true.  I just have to sigh at that.  I will have my hands full doing damage control for their poor parents. =)  I'm just excited that there's yet another baby around.  Boy or girl, they're all new and equally special to me.  And no, it doesn't make me want them just yet.  The more time goes by, the more sure I am that I want a family  eventually , but just not quite yet.  There's a few little things for now - being too selfish, not being financially stable enough, not being married, and not having BF on board quite yet.  He still has a tendency to maintain that he doesn't want kids, but it slips more and more into casual conversations that he sees himself having them  one day.   And he's always been that way . . . he makes it seem like he's totally against something, especially when "everyone's doing it" (ie serious relationships, moving in together, getting married, etc), until all the fuss has died down and he decides he's good and ready.  And I like that.  I wouldn't feel right being with someone where I'd constantly be worrying whether they're doing things because they feel pressured to, and not because it's right for them.  I've never had to worry about that with BF, and I like it.  So - that should be it for babies for now.  3 little ones in just over a month . . . I'm not even participating and I'm exhausted! =)

       I really can't think of a good title for this post, since it's just going to be ramblings, so onward we go . . .    Friday was so unreal.  Although I thought the new parents might want their space, I couldn't resist the urge to go and visit them in the hospital.  Besides, I rationalized, New Daddy wouldn't have left me a message with their room number if he didn't really want visitors, right?  We made it there barely a half-hour before visiting hours were over.  Baby Shari was feeding when we got there, so Dad came out and gave us all the details and stories of the past day and a half.  They certainly weren't afforded the much simpler-sounding experience that BF's sister-in-law went through.  But all in all, Mom looked really good when I saw her (briefly), though it was apparent both she and her husband were seriously lacking in rest.  So, I employed more willpower on Saturday, having been told that I'd get a phone call when they arrived home.  Went to swimming in the morning, and that helped to keep me patient.  But with BF on call and away working all day, by 6pm I was getting restless.  So I ventured a call to their house.  It turns out they'd been home a few hours, and our other friends were already over there.  I did my best to gloss over the slightly hurt feelings, because it's perfectly understandable that they would have plenty more important things on their mind than making sure they called everyone.  I asked if they'd eaten, and when the answer was no, I offered to pick up food on my way over, so at least I didn't feel completely useless. =)  I was so excited - despite visiting them at the hospital the previous night, I still hadn't met Shari because she was under a blanket, feeding at the time.  Dad looked a little haggard, but surprisingly enough, Mom looked pretty darn normal.  She was just like her normal self, albeit probably still very tired.  And Shari is so incredibly perfect.  She's not even my baby, but I think she's perfect.  The best part was, after we'd finished eating, Shari's daddy got up and placed her in my arms without a word.  I've never had people trust me like that before.  It's always been "Do you want to hold him/her?" because I'll never ask.  I know that part of it was the fact that the other 5 people were heading out for a smoke, and being the only non-smoker, I'd be the only one staying inside.  But still - he didn't say "Wanna take her while we go out?" or he could have even placed her in her crib or something . . . it just felt really good to be treated like that.  And another thing I quite enjoyed (tho you'll all think I'm crazy for it).  Every time I've had a baby in my arms (OK, the whole 3 or 4 times), as soon as they start crying in the slightest, someone (Mom, Grandma, a closer relative) will come rushing up and take the baby away.  And this has only served to re-inforce my anxiety when a baby cries.  But Shari started wailing on more than one occasion, and while Mom and Dad kept an eye on her, nobody seemed to think that it meant I shouldn't be holding her anymore, or that she needed to be snatched away.  I'm so excited about this new little family.  I hope we continue to be a regular part of their lives for years and years to come.  My parents never really had close family friends that visited often . . . so it would be nice to  be  those close family friends this time.  And who knows?  Maybe by the time they're thinking about baby #2, I'll be ready to join them?

        Today's Lesson    Happy blogs don't make for interesting reading.  Angst is rivetting.  Misery fascinates.  Even more so when the writer has talent.  Happiness is mundane.  Goodness is boring.  In reading, mind you - not always so in live conversations.  I love hearing about the cute things my friends' babies are doing, and love it even more when I'm there to witness them.  I don't enjoy it quite as much when I can hear them screaming in the background.  Am I alone in this observation?

         urlLink The Kabalarian Philosophy    Try it out.  Only a few names really didn't suit the people I know - most were dead on.  Mine was one of the latter (dead on) . . .   "The name of  Angela  creates a very quiet, practical nature and a clever and inventive mind. Being analytical and naturally studious, you are interested in a factual understanding of the mysteries of life. Your methodical nature requires that you like to finish what you start without interruptions and also to have everything in its place and properly organized. An ability to concentrate could take you into computer programming or accountancy or any work requiring concentration and attention to detail. You have, also, a flair for creative expression with your hands. You take life seriously and can be easily and deeply hurt and go into moods which can be quite extreme at times, causing much turmoil and unhappiness."  Shall we see what might be in store for the three new little people in my world? . . .   "Your name  Shari  has given you tenacity of purpose and has made you extremely independent. Whatever you undertake, you approach from your own point of view, and others either have to conform to your ideas or go their own way and leave you to work things out for yourself. You are so narrowly focused in your pursuits that you frequently overlook the little personal considerations and attentions that create a bond of understanding and sense of companionship. Thus it is difficult for you to merge your efforts harmoniously with others."  Uh oh - let's hope they're wrong about her . . . I'd like to think she'll take after her name-sake . . .   "Your name of  Kalen  creates a quick, clever mind capable of grasping and assimilating new ideas. You are rather studious, mentally challenging each new idea before accepting it. Because you learn so quickly you have little patience with those whose mental processes are somewhat slower, and you could become supercilious or somewhat "know it all" in your attitude. This characteristic could make you rather unpopular with your associates. Although you are very knowledgeable and intelligent, you often find spontaneous verbal expression difficult. You crave friendship, understanding, love, and affection although your reserved manner appears forbidding to others."  Awww, a little Mr. Know-It-All . . . =)  "The name of  Lukas  indicates you are a diligent and persevering worker who enjoys a routine occupation where you can do a job well and finish what you start. You like to work at your own speed, without pressure, as you prefer to take your time to work step by step in your own way. You could become frustrated and thwarted in your efforts if too many changes or disruptions occur. Also, you do not appreciate people enforcing new methods or ideas on you, as you like to examine all the details before making changes."  Very interesting . . . I guess only time will tell . . .

        Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the Right . . . Here I am, Stuck in the middle with you    Well, it's not the most appropriate title, but the song comes to mind when I think of what I want to write.  It really feels like BF and I are stuck in the middle - he may disagree, but that's how I feel.  "Clowns to the left of me . . . "  So they're really not clowns, but I have one group of friends that is predominantly single and/or still living at home (read: basically responsibility-free).  I don't see much, if anything, of these friends anymore, as I'm sure I've eluded to several times before.  I hear/read about all these exciting things they get up to, and I feel a little left out.  But the bar scene doesn't hold much attraction for me anymore.  And while I'd like to think I'm open to trying new things, our tastes in music/movies/food tends to differ greatly, and I'm a little cheap when it comes to spending money on things I'm not sure I'll like.  If I was single, it might be different - there'd be some motivation in trying new things, mainly to meet new people and possibly make some connections.  But since I have someone at home that I'd like to share fun times with once the weekend comes, there really isn't much motivation.  Also not helping is that these are friends I had before BF, and while it's not that they don't get along, BF is a man's man and doesn't find much attraction in being the only guy in a gaggle of girls.  "Jokers to the right . . . "  Again, they're not jokers, but then there's my other distinct group of friends.  And they've all got even more responsibility than me - a house to look after, as well as babies.  I hang out with these friends the most.  But again, I feel a little left out.  The two women can (and probably do) talk for hours about their babies, the troubles their having, and little tricks they're finding out.  Sure, I can ask questions and listen, but it's not really relevant to me yet.  And of course they're not about to go out and party.  "Here I am, stuck in the middle with you . . . "  And that about sums it up.  Going out just the two of us is only so much fun for so long.  Eventually you need a few more people to make it more lively and interactive.  Cuz we've heard each others' stories throughout the week.  And the few couples we've met in the last little while have some little quirk or other that prevents us from becoming good friends, or hanging out more often.  One of them makes us really uncomfortable, because they are just not a good couple.  She bashes him, he just takes it, and it's really awful to watch.  Another one does the long distance thing, so we only hang out once in a long while when she's in town (and not otherwise pre-occupied).  Don't get me wrong - I wouldn't change my life right now for anything.  It's just hard being stuck between two very different sets of friends and feeling a little left out with both.  I think we should start saving up for that trip to Jamaica . . . =)

        Blogging Drought    Blame it on the weather, or actually having a job that keeps me busy, but there's been a serious blogging drought around here.  Just in case you hadn't noticed. =)  Then again, maybe it's just cuz there's really nothing interesting going on in my life lately.  You've all heard about the babies.  Nothing new there.  We see the nephew probably once a month or so, and the other two at least once a week.  And they grow like weeds.  It's really pretty amazing.  Still got the same job, believe it or not.  Mind you, it's only been 3 months.  Still got the same car, same house, same boyfriend, same pets.  Who are, by the way, very hurt that no one wanted to say Hi back to them.  I tried to explain that it was my fault, but you know how cats are . . .   Can't think of any better definition of the saying, "Same ol', same ol'"  Describes me to a T these days.  Not that I'm really complaining.  I'm very impatient though.  I hate our new neighbours to the south of us.  Moved in about a month ago, and have been nothing but trouble ever since.  We're pretty sure they're the ones who called the by-law officer about our Pepsi machine in the backyard, and the broken fire pit.  He (the officer) came out because he had to, but didn't see any problem with our back lot.  The bricks were frozen to the ground, the Pepsi machine locked and legal.  (Apparently it's against city by-law to have an unlocked, unattended fridge lying around, because little kids or stupid adults could crawl in and hurt themselves or something.  I say that's Darwinism at work.)  I want to get our garage started so we can get a fence and the rest of our yard done.  We still don't have a number for a guy who'll do the concrete pad for us.  But that's BF's territory, so I'm trying to back off and be patient.  Patience is definitely not a virtue of mine.  Because once the garage is mostly done, we can get started on the rest of the yard.  Meaning a fence, some grass, a deck, and probably a dog run.  Which then means we can look at getting a puppy again.  Eyes wide open this time, of course.  We'd make sure we had a comfortable dog run with a dog house for the daytime when we're at work.  I can come home at lunch to let him out, play a bit.  Maybe go for a walk.  Plan for puppy classes right at the start, not after problems start arising.  Make sure we do the kennel training properly so he doesn't learn to hate his kennel.  So yeah, I'm a little impatient.  And then there's summer.  Still to come, and so many things planned.  In addition to all the yard work, and possibly puppy work, I want to do more camping this year.  Go white water rafting.  Do some go karting (never tried it).  And just generally get up to all sorts of trouble.  It's a good year to turn 25.  I'm ready for it.  Just before I go, a little bit of "awwwwwww" for you . . . meet Shari and Kalen.

        That's OK  urlLink boys  - I understand that you're still human and won't win them all.  It's not your fault if the refs decide to ignore some pretty blatant penalties against the Sharks, while calling some unfair ones on you.  We'll still be rooting for you boys on Sunday!

       Hmmmm, guess I should call people soon if I expect them to show up for my birthday bash . . . guess I should also figure out the details before I call them.  And a great big thanks to  urlLink Desiree  for the early birthday card. =)  I DO intend to thank you personally by email, I'm just a little lazy these days!  Been sick lately - it sucks.  Missed work, missed lotsa swimming, slept lots.  But at least it happened before my birthday and long weekend camping and all that summer fun.  Calgary's gonna become known for it's exhibitionist women . . . seems all it takes for girls to start baring their breasts is a dynamite hockey team . . . guys, start planning your trips up here for Stampede this summer! =)  BF got me a kick-ass birthday gift, and I got it early.  Maybe there's hope for him yet.  Damn  urlLink LaSenza  . . . of course, they have to come out with a cute new bra but stop short of making it in my size.  Almost every other style comes in my size, except for the cute new ones.  Damn LaSenza.  I need new underthings.  Where am I gonna get a hoodie for camping at this time of year?  Everyone's already putting their spring fashions on clearance . . .   Hmmm, can't tell I'm thinking of way too many innane things today, huh?  And the last random thought of the day . . . it kinda sucks to be somebody's boss.

         Blahhhhhhhhh     Just before I begin, I'd like to add . . .     GO FLAMES GO!!    It's just incredible, and yes, maybe a little crazy, the way this big/small city has rallied around it's hockey team.  And you're giving us plenty to rally around, Iggy and Conroy and Commodore and Gelinas and Kipprusoff and all the rest that I'm ashamed to say that I can't name off the top of my head.  Hey, don't blame me - I'm openly a bandwagon fan.  But it's a helluva bandwagon to join.  Besides Stanley Cup fever, I'm bored out of my mind these days.  Literally.  I'm mentally bored and it's making me restless at work.   Already.   I was hoping I'd get a few more months along before it hit, but apparently not.  A few weeks ago, I got  two  calls from a lady wanting to talk to me about a job that she thought  really suited  my skills and experience.  She felt so strongly that she called again a week later (I never got the original message).  It was so tempting, but in the end, I knew it would be best if I didn't even know what the job was.  So I left her a message saying I already had a job. *sigh*  So since changing jobs is just not an option, I'm really pushing for my employer to help me out with a course.  Figure if I'm gonna be at this job for a while yet, I might as well start working toward SAIT's Bachelor of Applied Petroleum Engineering.  Unfortunately, it's not a designated degree, but hey, it'll keep me occupied for a while.  Then maybe once I've exhausted that option, BF will be exploring transfers or other diversions.  But since the head honcho is outta town for a while, I gotta sit tight.  And meanwhile, BF is going to school for his second semester of his apprenticeship.  Making me   veeeeerrrryyyy   green with envy.  I wish I was in school.  Then again, I like my paycheques.  I wish I'd gotten paid to go to school.  He doesn't get much sympathy from me when he starts ranting about the government cutting back on their subsidy of the trades.  The government didn't give me any help when I went to school, except to make sure I owed them plenty of money when I was done.  And I didn't get to collect EI, either.   I also wish I could distract myself with imaginings of how our backyard will look.  Unfortunately, I'm giving up hope and am starting to think that it's not going to look any different come September.  No mid-summer BBQs with friends, no lazy weekday nights on the deck with a beer, no backyard fires.  It's BF's territory to get the garage going, and I'm sick of nagging.  And until the garage is done, all our money is tied up with a lawyer.  And as time ticks on, I draw closer to following in  urlLink Leah's  footsteps.  In 10 days, I will have lived for a quarter of a century.    A friend (and co-worker) keeps bugging me about being old.  But it doesn't bother me.  Sure, I feel old when I talk to my youngest brother - who's 18 - and reminisce about being that age again.  But more than anything, it just makes me eager . . . hey, it's time to start living my life!  No more of this, 'Yeah, that sounds cool, but . . . ' and more of 'OK, let's figure out how we can do this!'  I've got a little practice under my belt - I never thought I'd have a house at this age, and I finally got back into swimming (and I'm sticking to it!).  Now to keep the momentum going . . .   Because I look around at my friends who have children now, and it hits home that if there are things I want to do, I have to do them now (if I plan on having a family one day) or be willing to wait until I'm almost retirement age.  I know having kids doesn't mean your life ends, but many things become a lot more difficult, complicated and  expensive  to do.    So, does all this rambling have a point?  No, not really.  Just letting you know I'm still alive somewhere out there. =)

        I've Become One Of  THOSE  people!!    Please, quick, someone kick my ass for me!  Oh well, it was a voluntary decision.  I always thought getting fit and losing weight went hand in hand.  But my progress since starting swimming has been meager at best.  So lately, I've been toying with the idea of dietary supplements to help things along.  I've always been a big advocate of simple common sense - exercise and eat healthier foods, and you'll lose weight.  It's that simple.  But I've been swimming regularly for 5 months now, and I can tell I'm definitely more fit, but I'm having trouble shaking the bit of chub I'm always trying to get rid of.  I've tried Xenadrine EFX (the Canada-friendly version) off and on, with the only effect being that it gives me the same energy boost I'd probably get from a few cups of coffee.  I tried TrimLife (ephedrine-free, of course) for a few days (their 'free 7-day sample', which, if taken at the recommended dosage really only lasts 3 days), but it wasn't really any different than the Xenadrine.  And I couldn't find it in any stores up here, and that made me nervous.  So I paid a visit to a local  urlLink GNC  store.  I figured if I was going to break my own rule, I'd better damn well do it right.  And getting advice from a real live person seemed more reliable to me than written accolades on the internet.  Turns out they have a reasonably new product that seems to be immensely popular.  She said that they were having a hard time keeping it on the shelves.  (I won't mention the name since I'm starting to feel like a walking advertisement for weight loss products.)  I glossed over that part (can we say "so buy it now!"?), since she had something good things to say that had nothing to do with selling me a product.  Comes with a 30-day guarantee, so if it reacts badly with me, or does nothing, I can get my money back.  That makes me feel a little better.  Plus, I know that a simple supplement isn't going to work wonders and 90% of the effort still has to come from me.  Maybe since I just finished a 5-month course of  urlLink Accutane , it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to take some different ones to help me lose a little weight.  But I sure hope the trend doesn't continue.  I definitely don't want to be one of  those  people who has tried 15 different types of supplements for weight loss - and is STILL fat. *L*  Today marks Day #1 of my month-long effort . . .

        Just a bit of randomness . . .     Keep your fingers crossed for me tomorrow morning . . . my favorite local radio station is finally offering a prize worth 'buying', but they're only releasing one, which means I have to be the first to grab it.  You listen for passwords throughout the day, and get points when you enter them, and save them up to 'buy' various prizes (movie passes, event passes, posters, etc) or entries into raffles.  And now we/I have enough to get a free 2-night stay at a fairly posh hotel in Canmore, complete with breakfast.  Me likes free weekend getaways. =)

        The Weekend Away    Just cuz I don't have much else to say these days . . . here's how the out-of-town wedding was . . .     Friday    Despite having the day off work, I was on the go from shortly after 7am.  BF's ride didn't show up, so I drove him to SAIT, then ran around for a few last minute things before getting my hair cut.  It's nice and short now, and I love it!  Anyways, we finally made it out of the city around 2pm, only to come across construction just outside of the city.  Friday at 2pm on the first nice weekend so far, and they weren't even doing any work - they just hadn't taken the cones down!  It took us just over an hour for a distance that would have normally taken 10 minutes.  Discovered a nail in one of the tires as we made a pit stop, had it repaired, and finally made it into Edmonton just after 6pm.  Only silly me hadn't paid too much attention to the map when I made the reservations.  I ended up taking us alllll the way past Edmonton into St. Albert before realizing where Kingsway was.  Headed back into Edmonton and finally found the hotel.  Kinda scuzzy, to be honest.  But we were only paying $69/night, so we figured we'd deal.  As we walked in, there was a cop trying to rouse a passed-out drunk in the lobby.  Got stopped by a guy on the way in - we both  swear  we heard him say 'Can you take a picture of me and my wife?' - who then walked over to this other very-well-built man.  After a second or so of contemplation, they lifted their shirts to display  very  ripped abs.  Turns out there was a body-building competition that weekend, in addition to an arm-wrestling competition, and several rugby teams were also staying at the hotel.  Dumped off our bags, and then headed back out again to visit West Ed.  The plan had initially been to enjoy the Waterpark, but due to all the delays, there just wasn't enough time.  So we just browsed - BF picked out his first shirt and tie in years - and had dinner at Hooters.  By the time we were heading back, we'd decided that the badly-sagging bed just wouldn't do, and that we'd ask if we could upgrade the room.  When we got back, it turned out there was only an executive suite - at $179/night - available.  BF piped in that all we really wanted was a room with a bed that didn't sag so badly.  After some more speedy typing, she said she could give us the executive suite for $89/night.  Sounded like a helluva deal to me.  It was in the nicer tower (as opposed to the mysteriously-odoured lowrise building), and huge.  King size bed with big TV, separate room with couch and  another  big TV, and all the little extras like an ironing board (complete with non-functioning iron), extra toiletries, and a hair dryer.  Like I said, it wasn't exactly a posh hotel, but this room was definitely better than the econojob we had before.  Quite pleased with ourselves, we indulged in a nightcap before heading to bed.  Tomorrow promised to be a long day.    Saturday    Buffet breakfast in the hotel was a tad disappointing.  Amazingly enough, I was ready in record time - probably thanks to the short hair and a surprisingly relaxed attitude (I'm usually a basket-case while getting ready for special occasions).  We left around 1pm to find the church, somewhere up near Ft. Saskatchewan.  Although they didn't provide any maps with the invitations, they did put signs up on the road as we approached the church, which was pretty thoughtful.  It was a quaint little countryside church, complete with that big tower bell.  The weather was absolutely gorgeous - even hot - and my favorite part was when they rang the bell after the ceremony.  The reception was surprisingly low-key, and by the time we left around 10:30pm or so, the place was already emptying out.  The food was really good, the groom got pretty drunk early in the evening, the bride was stunning, and I had to endure an awkward moment with BF's father.  My feet were killing me by the end of the evening (I have yet to find a pair of nice dress shoes/sandals that doesn't hurt after a full day of wear).  Despite a rather pleasant day, it ended on a rather sour note.  Since we were back so early, and only had his brother for company (his brother's wife stayed in her room with the baby), we were ready to sleep by midnight (geezers! *L*).  BF kicked his brother out, and we were soon fast asleep.  Only I got rudely woken up about an hour and a half later by this obnoxiously-loud knocking on the door.  It was his brother again, claiming he knew we were in there and wanted us to let him in.  The other younger brothers were with him.  BF didn't wake up, and I was nice and warm under the covers.  You'd think any normal person would give up after one or two knocks, especially at 1:30am.  But no, not BF's brother.  The knocking got louder, and he even took a couple of running starts at the door.  I don't know if a neighbour called security, or if one of the younger boys finally convinced him to give it up, but it finally stopped after about 5 minutes.  I was wide awake and   very   unimpressed, but BF was still fast asleep.  But not long after the door-pounding stopped, the phone started to ring.  Constantly.  Around 8 rings, BF was starting to wake up, and by 10 he had crossed the room to pick it up.  It was one of the younger boys asking if we could let them in so they could have some beer!  BF gave him a piece of his mind.  They even had the balls to call back after he hung up.  BF said he picked up again, ready to let loose, and heard someone in the background say to just forget it, we were sleeping.  I'd like to say I couldn't believe they did all that, but it really doesn't surprise me.  BF's older brother is just that obnoxious.    Sunday    Despite the rude awakening the night before, Sunday turned out quite nice.  Since the hotel restaurant was packed with Father's Day brunchers, we checked out and headed to the nearest Denny's.  This was the best part - checking out.  The girl behind the counter wasn't the one who'd given us the upgraded room.  So she printed out our receipt, looked at the one printed out when we checked in, and said "Oh!  This is supposed to be $69, not $89!  I'll just change that for you . . . "  It was so hard to keep from giggling, but I did until we were outside the hotel.  We got an executive suite for 2 nights for less than most people would have paid for one night!  Feeling  VERY  pleased with myself, it was a little easier to be patient when we got to Denny's and a 10-minute wait turned into 30 minutes.  Over breakfast, we decided that we were both feeling too lazy to bother with the Waterpark and would just head home.  And so we did.  And we just missed the rain, so we got an entire weekend of lovely sunshine.  And I was very glad to be back home, to our own bed, and our own comfy couch.

        Damn weather . . . damn banks, too . . .      I'm not enjoying this weather anymore.  I know rain is good for farmers and it makes everything green and it's been years since we've had decent rain in May & June . . . but I'm getting tired of it.  Last weekend, we finally made the leap and got everything arranged for the fence.  Got the materials delivered, friends invited to help, and the weather even seemed like it was going to cooperate.  It took the majority of the day to get the posts cemented and crossbars screwed in.  Around 4:30, it started raining, which was OK - a perfect time to pack it in before the game started.  All that was left to do was slap in the vertical boards.  Pretty easy work for me and BF to do on our own the next day.  Slight snag - it poured ALL DAY Sunday.  And I didn't mind at the time, since it seemed like a good day for a lazy rainy day.  I figured we'd get it done during the week or, at the latest, the next weekend.  Well, it rained all week.  That, or I didn't really want to give up swimming when we could wait til the weekend.  The weekend came and went, with more rain.  We made an attempt on Sunday afternoon, though the ground was still muddy.  Got a few sections up, but it was barely 1/4 done.  And this week hasn't been much better.  Yesterday we finally had a break from the rain in the evening, only to find that we couldn't do it anyways since the boards were wet and swollen.  BF doesn't really understand my frustration . . . but I look ahead, and it seems like the next 2-3 weeks are completely spoken for.  A wedding out of town this weekend, BF's exams next week, plans to visit a friend's farm next weekend, a likely-insane first week back at work for BF, and him being on-call the weekend after.  And I wonder - if it takes us this long to get a measly fence up, how many months is it going to take for a garage?  Which brings me to the next part of it - damn banks!  They lent us extra money when we got a mortgage so we could build a garage, but it's being held in trust by the real estate lawyer.  The condition being that the money would not be released until the building was complete and all permits issued.  No big deal if you're having someone build it for you - just set up a payment agreement.  Only problem is, we've since decided that the money we can save by doing it ourselves is well worth it.  But we'd still have to pay someone to do the concrete pad.  At one point, I swear I was told it wouldn't be a big deal to get the lawyer to pay a concrete company directly for that part of it.  Which would have been great.  But now they're saying that no-way-no-how are they letting us have a penny of OUR MONEY before everything's all done.  Because it was written in as part of the approval.  The kicker?  We're still paying interest on this extra money, and I'm pretty darn sure the law firm is MAKING interest on it while it sits in their hot little hands.  Fer cryin' out loud . . . they'll lend us over $160K for a house, but hang on FOR DEAR LIFE to another $11K to improve it - increase its value, even.  The more time that goes by, the more determined I am to switch banks either when the mortgage term is up, or when we sell the house, whichever comes first.  Damn laywers.  Damn banks.  I could get started on the government, but I'll restrain myself for today.  I think I've ranted enough for one day. =)

        If you don't see me for a while, it's probably 'cuz I've dropped dead of exhaustion . . .      So I'm stepping up the swimming thing.  I was swimming 3 days a week - Monday, Wednesday and Saturday - at 1.5 hours each time.  But the Masters Club allows people to sign up for June/July/August, and my current program doesn't end until July 3.  Which means that, until the end of June, I'll be swimming Monday thru Thursday, and Saturdays when I don't have other commitments (still all 1.5 hours each).  I figure if I'm not fit by the end of the month, there's just no hope for me.  Visual results from all this swimming have been slow in coming.  After supplementing swimming with 2 gym workouts a week (just cardio - I had absolutely no desire to do weights), the scale began to give a little.  Just a little, mind you.  After more than 4 months of swimming, I have yet to reach a 10-lb loss.  But my arms are starting to look nice and toned. =)  So I decided a few weeks ago that I would track measurements as well as weight.  This week was my first week of doubled-up swimming . . . Monday, I opted for the gym (so I could still watch the game!), Tuesday was Club practice, Wednesday was regular practice, and last night was another Club practice.  I'm so tired and sore.  And Saturday will be regular practice.  I hope I can make all 4 next week.  I can't believe that I used to swim as much as 9 times in 5 days - and then compete on the weekend! - back in my teens.  Man, am I getting old! =)  But it feels  so  good to be back in it.  And in July 2005, I intend to kick some butt at the World Masters' Games in Edmonton . . .

        If Only . . .    our beloved boys had shown up for the game at the start, instead of arriving for the last 10 minutes.  Donovan hadn't been injured.  Khabibulan hadn't made some absolutely fantastic saves in those last 10 minutes.   Ah well - that's how things go sometimes.  I won't say the Bolts didn't deserve it, because they definitely did.  They played hard, and smart, had a great goalie and just made it look like they wanted it just  thatmuchmore  than our Flames.  Good job to the Flames, and congrats to the Bolts.  I look forward to jumping on this bandwagon from the start next season . . .

        What's a person to do?    I have never been terribly sure how to act around mentally handicapped people.  I mean the obviously handicapped - Downs' syndrome is kinda different.  I had a rather disturbing experience on my lunch break today.  My friend and I were at the mall, and were taking a minute or two after eating to decide which direction we'd head in for some browsing.  We were still sitting at the table when this man sat down right next to me (we were 2 sitting at a table for 4).  Now, sometimes tables can be tough to find at lunchtime, but most people will politely ask before they sit down.  So I turned and noticed that this guy was handicapped - seemingly enough so that I figured he must be with a group or at least a supervisor or something.  Before I could say anything or get up to free the table, he turned to me, took my hand and began to pull my arm as if to pull me to him.  He asked me how I was doing.  Extremely uncomfortable and not sure how to react, I said with a nervous smile on my face "I'm fine, thanks" and quickly pulled away and got up.  I felt kinda bad because I wasn't sure he knew what he was doing - I figured he must have thought I was his 'helper' or something - and didn't want to make a big scene.  People nearby who witnessed it were giving me weird looks - in my confusion and awkwardness, I couldn't tell if they were sympathic or judgemental.  I feel bad because had that been a child (probably the same mental capacity), I probably would have reacted very differently.  I would have been gentle, amused, and looking around for a concerned Mom or Dad.  Instead, I felt kinda violated and a little indignant that there didn't seem to be someone keeping an eye on him to prevent or relieve this awkward situation.  When I got up, he did too, and seemed a little lost as my friend and I bee-lined for the washrooms.  Am I a horrible person for this, or do most people tend to react like that?

        'Talking It Over' can be highly over-rated . . .      Today, I made the monumental mistake of forgetting the cardinal rule of communication - never 'talk it out' when one or both parties are still angry.    &nbsp;  I've had it, and I don't care of certain 'parties' read this anymore, I deal with things in my own way and this is one of them.    &nbsp;  Issues have come up at work, because I work with a friend.&nbsp; It was bound to happen eventually.&nbsp; Things have been slacking on her end&nbsp;lately, mostly due to recent surgery, and rather than say something, I figured she knew she wasn't doing the best job and would do something about it.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I'm getting stressed out because there have been a bunch of changes and I'm still trying to figure them out.&nbsp; And still get all the work done in a reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; And thus got silent at work.    &nbsp;  My thinking was - Don't bother saying anything.&nbsp; It's your problem that it makes you angry, she's not an idiot, she'll shape up soon enough.    &nbsp;  Only apparently my silence was making HER angry, and when she sent me an email  at work &nbsp;instead of talking to me, it only made me&nbsp;angrier and blahblahblahblahblah whinewhinewhinewhine.&nbsp; Point being, we talked about it today.    &nbsp;  Good God!&nbsp; What kind of people think that telling someone you want to kill them is productive to solving a problem?!&nbsp; Or that you're so stressed out that going to work makes&nbsp;you want to kill yourself?!&nbsp; How helpful can it be, once you're finally talking to someone, to repeat five or six times that they're impossible to talk to?    &nbsp;  Attack me like that, and it's not talking things over, it's putting me on the defense.&nbsp; My brain will shut down and you won't get anything useful out of me.    &nbsp;  I tried  really  hard to stay logical and non-emotional, but in the end, I felt more hurt than anything.&nbsp; 'So tell her', you say?&nbsp; Yeah right, and have that happen all over again?&nbsp; Forget that idea.    &nbsp;  We talked about her quitting.&nbsp; She accused me of sending her mixed messages - hidden ones saying "I want you to quit" and direct ones saying "I never said I want you to quit."&nbsp; Don't freakin' look for hidden messages.&nbsp; Don't go to your mom or your sister to decipher an email I sent you - if you're not sure what I mean, ask me yourself fer cryin' out loud.    &nbsp;  "But you're impossible to talk to!"&nbsp; For the third time.    &nbsp;  Well, we're talking now, aren't we?    &nbsp;  I'm pretty sure she thinks things are all fine now, since we did talk about possible solutions for about 30 seconds.&nbsp; But they're not, at least not for me, and I hardly feel like bashing it out again, not after that.    &nbsp;  I'm left feeling like this was all my problem to begin with, that it's all my fault, and that because we work together, I made it her problem too.&nbsp; That I'm the reason she can't work, because she stresses out&nbsp;about work so much that she can't sleep.&nbsp; And on and on and on.    &nbsp;  So now I'm angry AND hurt.&nbsp; Because it's damn hard to separate the personal attacks from the constructive criticism.&nbsp; And there seemed to be plenty of the former, only a few of the latter.    &nbsp;  *sigh*&nbsp; 'Suck it up, princess', right?&nbsp; 'Be the bigger person and just forget about it.'&nbsp; Easier said than done.

        Happiness in the small things        &nbsp;   So I was pretty excited on Friday.&nbsp; Had to come down at some point.     &nbsp;   We finally decided a few things, BF and I.&nbsp; The biggest one that pretty much decided everything else - we'll start looking at selling the house next year.     &nbsp;   We're quickly running out of summer, and if we were to start a garage even in the next couple of weeks, it would mean a lot of sacrificed activites and a lot of hard work and probably a lot of worrying if the weather would cooperate long enough.&nbsp; So, with the promise of being able to look for a house with a garage already built, BF can live without one here.&nbsp; So we'll finish the yard, extend the fence to define a parking pad, and leave it at that.     &nbsp;   And that makes me feel a great deal better.&nbsp; I think it's going to be a nagging battle just to get the yard done, let alone a big project like a garage.&nbsp; There's just so many other things we'd hoped to be doing this summer.&nbsp; And I hate being a nag.&nbsp; But it needs to get done before it's too cold for sod to take, and sod will probably be the last thing we do.&nbsp; Meaning time is definitely not on our side.     &nbsp;   With that decision out of the way,&nbsp;a few others fell into place.&nbsp; I had figured that the money left over after the garage was built would be plenty for a second vehicle (or, more recently, a vacation).&nbsp; No garage = no extra chunk of&nbsp;money = creative thinking.     &nbsp;   I'll admit - I was pretty crushed when it sank in that a Hedonism vacation was&nbsp;unrealistic now.&nbsp; But this is one of the many things I love about BF - he wasn't fazed at all.&nbsp; When faced with new circumstances, he simply rolls with it.     &nbsp;   His brilliant suggestion was that we take a road trip - head out the door with some camping supplies and maybe a map, and not know exactly where we're going until we get there.&nbsp; This is another thing we talked about doing last summer.     &nbsp;   And you know what?&nbsp; That kind of a vacation makes me even more excited than some exotic beach destination.&nbsp; I love spontaneity, but it just isn't something that comes naturally to me.     &nbsp;   I'm still a little worried about getting the yard done before the summer's over, but perhaps with some creative thinking on my part I can avoid seeming like a nag.     &nbsp;   I'm slowly learning to find happiness in the small things - it certainly helps having BF around to remind me of everything we have when I get carried away worrying about what we don't.

        *groan*        &nbsp;   That's the last time I ditch swimming for that long without a good excuse.&nbsp; My strokes felt (and probably were) sloppy and I'm sore today.&nbsp; That'll teach me to be lazy!     &nbsp;   On a much brighter note . . . for the last few months, I've casually mentioned a few times to BF that we should take a real vacation sometime this year, perhaps September or October since that might be the best work lull for the both of us.&nbsp; At first, I suggested that we just book a week off and cruise last-minute specials.     &nbsp;   More recently, I got an email notice about some fanastic deals at SuperClubs all-inclusive resorts - 50% plus off their regular rates if you book by August 31 to travel between September and November.&nbsp; So I mentioned it to BF again, but didn't get much of an enthusiastic response, so naturally figured it wasn't a top priority for him.     &nbsp;   I can bide my time - I'd rather wait and go on a vacation we're both excited about than push for something&nbsp;just because *I* want it.     &nbsp;   But then, the other night, he came home and said, "So have you booked us a vacation yet?"     &nbsp;   I just about fell off the couch.&nbsp; I'd mentally dropped the idea of a vacation for the time being.     &nbsp;   See, waaaaaaay back about 2 or more years ago, we first got introduced to the idea of  urlLink Hedonism  resorts.&nbsp; It became one of those "we gotta do that someday" things.&nbsp;   Hedonism is a SuperClubs resort - and among the specials listed in the email.&nbsp; Someday pretty much translates into "before we have too much responsibility and/or we're too old."&nbsp; Someday could be now.     &nbsp;   So I've spent a good chunk of my morning investigating prices.&nbsp; Started off looking at some of the cheaper destinations, and then became obsessed with Hedonism.&nbsp; Looked into airfares, and package deals,&nbsp;basically trying to get a fairly accurate idea of what this might cost.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  It's not unreasonable, and&nbsp;all-inclusive, if we go sometime in mid-October for an entire week (Sat-Sat).     &nbsp;   Unfortunately, we've also been thinking seriously about a second vehicle.&nbsp; A vacation of this magnitude would mean putting that off until after Christmas.     &nbsp;   But we're not getting any younger, still have that childless freedom, what better excuse could we have for such a vacation?&nbsp; Now I just have to see if BF agrees with my way of thinking . . . =)

        Confessions      &nbsp;     I've missed 4 swim practices in a row - I'm officially a slacker.&nbsp; I kicked my own ass after missing last night, so I think that'll be the end of that streak.    I watch an awful lot of Baby Story these days - I discovered this morning that it's on from 7-7:30am . . . baaaaaaaad news! =)    Lots of things (including Baby Story and wedding shows) get me all choked up with emotion these days.    I kinda hate work&nbsp;lately.&nbsp; I'm too young and inexperienced to be the go-to person.    I  almost  adopted a kitten.&nbsp; I've given that up for now.    I love my friends' kids, including BF's nephew.&nbsp; They can do no wrong in my eyes.    I  finally  get to go to the spa with my mum next Friday - but if anyone from work asks, I'm leaving early because I have a doctor's appointment.    I worry sometimes that BF won't ever want to get married.    I also worry that BF won't ever want kids, and that someday I'll be forced to make an excruciating decision between him and having children.    I worry about a lot of things that aren't really under my control, or things that involve more than just myself.    I have a lot on my mind these days, but nobody to talk to without feeling like a burden (or a nag).

        Talk about timing!     This past week has seen quite a few temptations and requests to add another feline to my current family.  A frank discussion with BF a few weeks back revealed that, despite his 'maybe' answer when I'd ask about a kitten, two cats were more than enough as far as he was concerned.  But earlier this week, a co-worker came back from lunch claiming he and another co-worker were going home with kittens that day - a waitress at the local lounge had a box full of kittens that were going back to BC with her mother if they weren't taken.  I really really wanted to go and simply see these kittens, but I had a pretty strong feeling that if I went, the temptation would be too great.  So I decided to test the waters again and called BF to see if his opinion still stood.  It did.  Le sigh.  "A third cat is just going to make everything accumulate that much faster" (meaning clumps of fur and doodies).  But then, not 2 days later, a co-worker approaches me about a former pet of hers.  She'd given up a much-loved pet due to allergies, and the current owner could no longer keep it.  But she also explained that it would probably need to be alone, and since I already have 2, that one didn't go very far.  Later that day, I was told of another story - this one very sad.  This lady's daughter's boyfriend had also previously given up a much-loved cat due to allergies.  But this is where it got worse.  It turns out the friend he gave it to just dumped the poor thing -  declawed  - and the Edmonton SPCA eventually picked it up and traced it back to the boyfriend through a microchip implant.  Apparently the Edmonton SPCA doesn't put "older" cats up for adoption (this one's only 6 years old - how the hell is that old??), and it already had an appointment with the vet's table if nobody came to claim her.  I called BF once again and told him the story.  I guess I've asked too many times now, because his response was a sigh followed by 'If you want another cat that badly, it's up to you.'  But I couldn't do nothing, knowing that I would most certainly find out if this cat got put down.  My co-worker said she'd call her daughter and get her to find out if it was too late or not.  This morning I got an update - the daughter tried to call for an hour last night but couldn't get through.  As of yesterday, the cat only had a day to live.  She called again this morning, and apparently caught the vet just after he gave the first injection (I guess they give a sedative first, then the lethal injection).  What incrediblely fateful timing.  I think my co-worker was so shaken up by the incident that she decided she was going to take the cat herself after all.  (She'd previously decided her one cat was too old and cranky to introduce someone new.)  So now I'm off the hook.  Perhaps it's for the best - after talking to the vet, it turns out this cat will need a lot of work and attention because she's had such a rough life for the last little while.  She's incredibly fearful and withdrawn.  I doubt she would feel very secure with our two little playful monsters.  But now I've kind of prepared myself mentally for another addition to the family . . . Part of me thinks I should take advantage of BF's resignation and adopt a kitten.  And part of me thinks I should take this as a sign and keep things the way they are.  Maybe wait until we have a bigger house with more space.  What a close call for one  very  lucky kitty . . .

       Stupid regulatory boards . . .    As far as I'm concerned, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board is full of retards.  Remember?  I got fired from there - I'm convinced because I was too smart.  They're making everyone's lives a living hell in the oil & gas industry - they require that any and all testing be reported, and there are regulations about reporting the initial conditions when you drill a new well.  This is nothing new.  But it used to be all nice and simple - you could submit these tests electronically, and it was simple enough that a local company created nifty software that converts all the data into the proper format with all the required info, and will even prompt you if you're missing something.  But now they have to go and completely change it.  Nobody seems to fully understand what is required anymore, the updated software is FUBAR as far as I'm concerned, and nothing is working.  It's making my working life a living hell.  I'm so stressed out that apparently I'm waking BF up in the middle of the night to talk angry gibberish.  But the government board is being so vague about the new formats and guidelines.  And anytime I try and ask a question, I get a terse response that is rarely useful.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        (By the way . . . )    I'm a  little  proud of myself . . . the last 2 weeks have seen another 2lbs shed, finally making it an even 10lbs so far.  And I finally got up the guts to take my measurements again, and I'm seeing 1" - 1.5" less on my torso, 1/4" less on my limbs.  The ultimate goal?  Another 10 to 13lbs, and the biggest measurement I care about is waist - another 3.5" to 5".

        My Bad . . .     Sheesh - I managed to make that whole post about me.  I'd meant to briefly mention my friends' experience in comparison.  It turns out the psychic described the physical looks of the men they were going to meet and end up with.  I wish I'd known this before my session, as it would have been interesting to have been a little more coy and see if she'd describe my man.    For them, she focussed a lot on career, telling Daisy she should be a hairdresser (she's a teacher! and loving it!), and Biskette that  she  should be a teacher ('been there, done that, wasn't for me' were her words, I believe).  She didn't have much to say to me about work, except that I'd be happiest in anything with a humanitarian slant.  I think that whole area is pretty gray anyways - people do what they do mainly to pay the bills.  She said some things to Daisy that Biskette and I got downright indignant about.  According to Daisy, the psychic basically told her she had to be thin to have a relationship.  I argued that perhaps she simply picked up on Daisy's own insecurities, and that she meant she wouldn't feel confident and secure in a relationship until she was thin.  But the more we discussed it, the more furious we got (Biskette especially).  Apparently the psychic went so far as to discuss 'Curves' as a good gym to go to.  She also told Biskette that her current man was no good for her.  That he made her crazy and confused, and she needed to end it.  She knows this, she's asked me and knows I agree, but it's hard to be logical about these things, especially when they involve you.  Maybe meeting her gray-eyed, dark-haired man (at Stampede! - the psychic was very specific about this) will give her strength. =)  Overall, it was a very interesting experience.  I don't know if I'd spend the money to go again anytime soon . . . though immediately after, it seemed like an interesting idea to go see a different psychic and compare the readings.  But at a roughly $80 experience ($60 for the session, $20 or so for noshies and coffee), I think I'll wait.  Anybody else out there been to a psychic?

        The Psychic Experience . . .     Before my mind dumps it in favor of new info . . .   Seeing a psychic has always been one of those things I've been sporadically curious about, but never enough to seek one out on my own.  So when it became a good friend's birthday present, I jumped at the chance to join in.  I was told it was at Conversations Tea Room at 3:30pm, and that was about it.  We showed up, and none of us was sure what to expect.  It seemed like a little coffee shop tailored to old ladies (elevator music, doilies everywhere, and a tad hoity-toity looking).  Turns out the psychic just works out of the tea room - she takes a table at the back for the 'session'.  The 'birthday' friend went first.  Daisy and I ordered some hoity-toity tea-time noshies and settled in, attempting to gauge Biskette's reaction even though her back was to us.  When she got back, she insisted that I go next, so I didn't get to hear any details until after my session.  Daisy went last.  She started out by having me write out my name, address and birthday.  She appeared to be doing some math, and basically did a numerology reading (or so I'm guessing).  Talked a lot about '5' people and their characteristics.  This part of the reading didn't really impress on me.  She just talked about general traits and such.  Said that people live their lives in cycles of 9 years, and that I was in the 8th year of a cycle, meaning it would be a harvest year for me.  A good year, an easy year.  I liked the sounds of that, but she hadn't said anything spectacular yet.  Next came the tarot cards.  She had me shuffle and pick out 3 cards from 2 different decks.  This part still remains a little fuzzy for me, as she seemed to be going rather quickly and it was all so vague, so I wasn't paying close attention.  But I remember a '4 bowls' card, an 'Energy' card, 'Desire' and something about an arrow.  She was talking on and on, almost losing me, until she suddenly leaned forward and said rather enthusiastically, "You're competitive!"  This made me chuckle - it's very true.  Any of my friends could tell you this, but this was a complete stranger whom I'd only met 10 minutes ago.  But the suddenness of the statement was amusing.   Now  she had my attention, and it seemed that the longer she talked to/sat with me, the more accurate she got.  From there, she went on to describe more of my personality - that I liked being a leader, that I hated being told what to do (this was a recurring theme), as well as being competitive (also a recurring theme).  That a big thing I needed to watch out for was learning to cooperate with others, because nobody got to the top alone.  That teamwork was a skill I needed to work on.  And also that I live mostly in my head.  This is also very true.  I'm very analytical, very intelligent (her words, I'm not being a braggart), very logical.  But that sometimes I let my head rule so much that I miss out on feeling and truly experiencing life.  This struck a chord with me.  That I need to work on 'getting out of my head and into my heart' a little more often, to actually feel things instead of thinking them.  Again, all this coming from a complete stranger.  Good advice, at the very least.  After the cards, she moved on to palm reading.  This part seemed a little textbook and generic to me, but interesting nonetheless.  She stroked my palm and followed some of the lines, kinda muttered a little, said something about my love line meeting my life line, said I'd have a long life.  Folded my hand over and played a little with that pointy bit of skin by my pinky (go ahead, make a fist - you'll see what I'm talking about), said something about 2 kids.  I wasn't entirely sure if she said I  had  2 kids, or  would have .  Then she moved on to my fingers, and this is where things got very amusing.  She said I had very creative hands - but I've never considered myself terribly creative (if at all).  She stroked them a little, and asked what I did.  This stumped me - I said that I used to play piano, but nothing these days.  She looked a little confused and kept playing with my fingers.  She asked if I painted . . . no.  Maybe drawing?  Nope.  Again, looking a little confused as if someone's telling her differently, and tries again.  Pottery, maybe?  No.  At this point, I'm having trouble containing my amusement, just because she seems to be so confused and trying so hard.  Again - flower arranging?  Nope!  Finally, she gives up, saying 'Well, you'd definitely be good at those things.'  It gave me pause, just because she wouldn't give up on that tangent.  Maybe I'm missing out on something? =)  And finally, she moved on to the tea leaves.  Unfortunately, she hadn't specifically told me to drink some of the tea sitting in front of me, so she handed me back the cup to take a few sips.  It was good tea (cinnamon-flavoured), but quite strong.  After a few sips, she took it back and went to strain it.  I believe she had already broached the relationship subject at this point.  But I don't recall if she knew I had a man in my life, or asked me.  At any rate, she had been able to describe him (personality, not looks), saying that it was a good relationship with lots of love.  But on to the leaves.  She turned the teacup this way and that, looking very contemplative.  She seemed to find what she was looking for, and showed it to me.  Apparently it was the center theme of the tea leaves - it really did look like a little couple standing together with the man hugging the woman from behind.  Quite cute, really. =)  She said again that it was a close relationship and that there was a lot of love.  Then she mentioned an older couple that was somewhat close to us.  She asked about my parents . . . not likely.  My parents haven't existed as a couple since long before I was 16 and they physically split.  His parents?  Doubtful.  Once again, I seemed to have stumped her.  She went on to describe the couple - they were older, and somewhat close to us.  For all outward appearances, they were very close, doing everything together.  But there was a gap between them (in the leaves), which meant there was a growing rift.  I chuckled and said 'That could be his dad, but it's not his mom - he's on his third wife these days.'  She laughed and said 'Well, maybe he'll be on his fourth before long.'  Then she went on to describe another character - another male in my life, but related.  Perhaps a sibling.  I volunteered that I had 3 brothers.  She said that could be it - that I was definitely closer to one than the rest.  Which is somewhat true - I've been talking (messaging) pretty frequently with my youngest brother these days.  She said he was protective of me, and when I seemed doubtful (he's younger, 18, and doesn't live with me - I didn't see him being protective), she went so far as to show me who he was in the tea leaves.  'See?  He's right over top of you, watching over you!'  That one baffled me.  She went on to talk a little more, without the tea leaves.  She had said back in the beginning that this would be a good year for sealing relationships.  Now she went back to that, asking how long we'd been together (3 years) and if I had a ring yet.  I said no.  She said she saw me being married (or at least engaged) by my next birthday.  This made me smile a little - hopeful, but also thinking that she didn't get a terribly good reading of my boyfriend.  She asked if we'd talked about marriage, and I said only in that neither of us is in a big hurry.  A little later, she said she sensed I was a little more ready than I let on.  I laughed.  When I related this to a different friend later, she said ' I  could have told you that!'  Yes, but again, this is someone who doesn't know me.  She said she sensed that the man in my life had thought about marriage, but was a little intimidated by the responsibility and enormity of such a step.  This could be true - I know it's not something he'd tell me.  He's very proud, and wouldn't say anything until he was sure he was ready.  She also said she sensed I was a little insecure about his feelings for me, but assured me that he wouldn't still be around if he didn't love me.  This caught me off-guard - just the night before, I'd had a frank discussion with BF and discovered that he felt really pestered about certain things.  This left me wondering what else bugged him about me, and how deep it went.  Indeed, I was very insecure.  She re-iterated that he put up with a lot from me (which elicited a bit of a guilty giggle), but he wouldn't have stuck around if he didn't care.  She talked a little bit about motherhood . . . said she saw a baby for me sometime in my 27th year . . . that I would enjoy motherhood, but that I would always need a life of my own.  This is something I've often thought about, and realized to be true about myself.  She said that I'd always need something of my own, to keep improving myself, and that this wasn't a bad thing because children eventually grow up and leave us.  I wondered if there was a hint of wistfulness in her voice at this point, or if it was just my imagination.  While I don't think I'll ever stop being hopeful about those events - married with a baby within the next 2 years or so - I've been trying to take everything she said with a grain of salt.  She was  way  off about some things, but she also had some good advice about my personality.  Part of me hopes that, now the weddings should be over for a while (BF is the last in his family to get married now), maybe BF will allow himself to think about it.  If there's one thing I've learned about him over the last 3 years, is that he refuses to be pushed into anything.  If he even  thinks  he's being pushed or forced or manipulated into something, he will do his damndest to go the other way.  But when he decides he wants something, he goes full steam ahead.  It happened with moving in together - I vaguely mentioned it, simply asking if he'd thought about it.  He quite honestly said no, and I dropped the subject.  A few months later, he asked me out of the blue if I wanted to move in with him.  Less than two months later, we were signing papers to buy a house together.  To be honest, I kind of like the fact that I don't know  for sure  what my life holds for me.  I can honestly say I love my life, and I don't mind waiting to see what happens.

         I DID IT!!     Holy chickydoodles, folks.  I got it!!!!  I sat diligently at my computer hitting 'refresh', and it paid off.  I got the free weekend stay in Canmore!  And I keep wanting to post about my (and my friends', if they don't mind) experience with a psychic last weekend, I just haven't found the time yet (cuz I don't want to rush the story!).  Hopefully that comes soon . . .

        That sure sucks.    $100 for a ticket, oodles of prizes, lots of people winning more than once . . .  You'd think we coulda won  something .  Anything.  Nope.  That'll teach me to impulse-buy lottery tickets for a cause I'm not really all that concerned about.  Had it been the Children's Hospital Home Lotto, I don't think I'd've minded if I didn't win anything.  Hawc2?  Ya, I'm a little bitter.  But it's my own fault - I didn't have to buy into it.  And I don't even get a tax receipt . . .
