       urlLink     Colleagues at undisclosed Workplace   Meet the pissed-off programmer. If you've picked up a newspaper in the last six months, watched CNN, or even glanced at Slashdot, you've already heard his anguished cry.He's the guy - and, yeah, he's usually a guy - launching Web sites like yourjobisgoingtoindia.com and nojobsforindia.com. He's the guy telling tales - many of them true, a few of them urban legends - about American programmers being forced to train their Indian replacements. Because of him, India's commerce and industry minister flew to Washington in June to assure the Bush administration that Indian coders were not bent on destroying American livelihoods. And for the past year, he's the guy who's been picketing corporate outsourcing conferences, holding placards that read WILL CODE FOR FOOD will code for food and chanting, "Shame, shame, shame!"Now meet the cause of all this fear and loathing: Aparna Jairam of Mumbai. She's 33 years old. Her long black hair is clasped with a barrette. Her dark eyes are deep-set and unusually calm. She has the air of the smartest girl in class - not the one always raising her hand and shouting out answers, but the one who sits in back, taking it all in and responding only when called upon, yet delivering answers that make the whole class turn around and listen.In 1992, Jairam graduated from India's University of Pune with a degree in engineering. She has since worked in a variety of jobs in the software industry and is now a project manager at Hexaware Technologies in Mumbai, the city formerly known as Bombay. Jairam specializes in embedded systems software for handheld devices. She leaves her two children with a babysitter each morning, commutes an hour to the office, and spends her days attending meetings, perfecting her team's code, and emailing her main client, a utility company in the western US. Jairam's annual salary is about $11,000 - more than 22 times the per capita annual income in India.Aparna Jairam isn't trying to steal your job. That's what she tells me, and I believe her. But if Jairam does end up taking it - and, let's face facts, she could do your $70,000-a-year job for the wages of a Taco Bell counter jockey - she won't lose any sleep over your plight. When I ask what her advice is for a beleaguered American programmer afraid of being pulled under by the global tide that she represents, Jairam takes the high road, neither dismissing the concern nor offering soothing happy talk. Instead, she recites a portion of the 2,000-year-old epic poem and Hindu holy book the Bhagavad Gita: "Do what you're supposed to do. And don't worry about the fruits. They'll come on their own." This is a story about the global economy. It's about two countries and one profession - and how weirdly upside down the future has begun to look from opposite sides of the globe. It's about code and the people who write it. But it's also about free markets, new politics, and ancient wisdom - which means it's ultimately about faith.Our story begins beside the murky waters of the Arabian Sea. I've come to Mumbai to see what software programmers in India make of the anti-outsourcing hubbub in the US. Mumbai may not have as many coders per square foot as glossier tech havens like Bangalore and Hyderabad, but there's a lot more real life here. Mumbai is India's largest city - with an official population of 18 million and an actual population incalculably higher. It's a sweltering, magnificent, teeming megalopolis in which every human triumph and affliction shouts at the top of its lungs 24 hours a day. Jairam's firm, Hexaware, is located in the exurbs of Mumbai in a district fittingly called Navi Mumbai, or New Mumbai. To get there, you fight traffic thicker and more chaotic than rush hour in hell as you pass a staggering stretch of shantytowns. But once inside the Millennium Business Park, which houses Hexaware and several other high tech companies, you've tumbled through a wormhole and landed in northern Virginia or Silicon Valley. The streets are immaculate. The buildings fairly gleam. The lawns are fit for putting. And in the center is an outdoor café bustling with twentysomethings so picture-perfect I look around to see if a film crew is shooting a commercial.Hexaware's headquarters, the workplace of some 500 programmers (another 800 work at a development center in the southern city of Chennai, and 200 more are in Bangalore), is a silvery four-story glass building chock-full of blond-wood cubicles and black Dell computers. In one area, 30 new recruits sit through programming boot camp; down the hall, 25 even newer hires are filling out HR forms. Meanwhile, other young people - the average age here is 27 - tap keyboards and skitter in and out of conference rooms outfitted with whiteboards and enclosed in frosted glass. If you pulled the shades and ignored the accents, you could be in Santa Clara. But it's the talent - coupled with the ridiculously low salaries, of course - that's luring big clients from Europe and North America. The coders here work for the likes of Citibank, Deutsche Leasing, Alliance Capital, Air Canada, HSBC, BP, Princeton University, and several other institutions that won't permit Hexaware to reveal their names. Jairam works in a first-floor cubicle that's unadorned except for a company policy statement, a charcoal sketch, and a small statue of Ganesh, the elephant-headed Hindu god of knowledge and obstacle removal. Like most employees, Jairam rides to work aboard a private bus, one in a fleet the company dispatches throughout Mumbai to shuttle its workers to the office. Many days she eats lunch in the firm's colorful fourth-floor canteen. While Hexaware's culinary offerings don't measure up to Google's celebrity chef and gourmet fare, the food's not bad - chana saag, aloo gobi, rice, chapatis - and the price is right. A meal costs 22 rupees, about 50 cents.After lunch one Tuesday, I meet in a conference room with Jairam and five colleagues to hear their reactions to the complaints of the Pissed-Off Programmer. I cite the usual statistics: 1 in 10 US technology jobs will go overseas by the end of 2004, according to the research firm Gartner. In the next 15 years, more than 3 million US white-collar jobs, representing $136 billion in wages, will depart to places like India, with the IT industry leading the migration, according to Forrester Research. I relate stories of American programmers collecting unemployment, declaring bankruptcy, even contemplating suicide - because they can't compete with people willing to work for one-sixth of their wages.The six Hexawarians are sympathetic but unmoved. They disagree with the very premise that cheap labor is hurting the US. And they think it's somewhat laughable that, because things aren't going exactly our way, ordinarily change-infatuated Americans are suddenly decrying change. "Back in the US, it's all about cheap, cheap, cheap. It's not only about India being cheap. It's quality services," says Jairam's colleague Kavita Samudra, who works on applications for the airline industry. "The fact that they're getting a quality product is why people are coming to us." Ritesh Maniar reminds me that Hexaware has scored a Level 5 rating from Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute, the highest international standard a software company can achieve. The others are quick to note that, of the 70 or so companies in the world that have earned this designation, half are from India. Over several days, here and at other companies, I hear this factoid repeated like a campaign talking point.Translation: We're not just cheaper, we're better. And that, they say, is good for everyone. Maniar, a senior technical architect, describes one American client: "We helped them become process-oriented, which they were not before. They were spending again and again on the same thing. We explained the process that we follow, because we would like to bring them up to our standards." "Don't you think we're helping the US economy by doing the work here?" asks an exasperated Lalit Suryawanshi. It frees up Americans to do other things so the economy can grow, adds Jairam.What begins to seep through their well-tiled arguments about quality, efficiency, and optimization is a view that Americans, who have long celebrated the sweetness of dynamic capitalism, must get used to the concept that it works for non-Americans, too. Programming jobs have delivered a nice upper-middle-class lifestyle to the people in this room. They own apartments. They drive new cars. They surf the Internet and watch American television and sip cappuccinos. Isn't the emergence of a vibrant middle class in an otherwise poor country a spectacular achievement, the very confirmation of the wonders of globalization - not to mention a new market for American goods and services? And if this transition pinches a little, aren't Americans being a tad hypocritical by whining about it? After all, where is it written that IT jobs somehow belong to Americans - and that any non-American who does such work is stealing the job from its rightful owner?Maybe these US programmers should simply adjust. That's what Indian textile workers did when their country's government opened its quasi-socialistic economy in 1991, says Jairam. Some people lost jobs. They complained, but they found something else to do. Maniar uncorks an aphorism that he doesn't realize I've heard 8,000 times before (in part because American white-collar workers have long said it to their blue-collar compadres) - and that I don't realize I'll hear several times again during my stay: "There's nothing permanent except change."Back in the US, you can feel the rage. Application developer Mike Emmons of Longwood, Florida, for example, is running for Congress on a platform that calls for the end of outsourcing. Emmons also wants to curtail temporary work visas for immigrant programmers, such as the always controversial H1-B and its stealthier counterpart, the L-1, which he says have cost him and other American programmers their jobs. "These cats will lie through their teeth," Emmons says, referring to incumbent members of Congress like the one he's trying to oust. "They're using immigration to reduce the wages of Americans." Other programmers, once resolutely go-it-alone apolitical types, have formed advocacy groups with righteous names like the Rescue American Jobs Foundation, the Coalition for National Sovereignty and Economic Patriotism, and the Organization for the Rights of American Workers. One such group has adopted a friendlier title, the Information Technology Professional Association of America. But its founder, 37-year-old Scott Kirwin, voices the same indignation. "I'm very pissed off," he tells me over lunch in Wilmington, Delaware, where he lives. "I want to make people aware of what's going on with outsourcing."Kirwin was a latecomer to the IT world. After college, he lived in Japan for five years, then returned to the States hoping to join the US Foreign Service. He didn't get in. In 1997, he and his wife moved to Wilmington, her hometown, and he took a job at a tech support company outside Philadelphia, where he learned Visual Basic. Kirwin discovered that he loved programming and did it well. By 2000, he was working at J.P. Morgan in Newark, Delaware, providing back-office database services for the firm's bankers around the world. But after Morgan merged with Chase, and the bloom left the boom, the combined firm decided to outsource the responsibilities of Kirwin's department to an Indian company. For nine months, he worked alongside three Indian programmers, all on temporary visas, teaching them his job but expecting to stick around as a manager when the work moved to India. Last March, Kirwin got his pink slip.The experience did more than capsize his work life. It battered his belief system. He's long espoused the virtues of free trade. He says that he supported Nafta and that for 12 years he's subscribed to The Economist, a hymnal in the free trade church. But now he's questioning core beliefs. "These are theories that have really not been tested and proven," he says. "We're using people's lives to do this experiment - to find out what happens.""I'm not religious," he tells me. "But I believe that everyone has to have faith in one thing. And my faith has been in the American system." That conviction is weakening. "Politicians are not aware of the problem that information workers are facing here. And it's not just the IT people. It's going to be anybody. That really worries me. Where does it stop?"Seventy miles up the Northeast Corridor is a politician who is asking that very question - and who, in the process, has become something of a folk hero to programmers like Kirwin. Shirley Turner represents the 15th District in the New Jersey State Senate. In 2002, Turner learned that eFunds, the company that administers electronic benefits cards for the state's welfare recipients, had moved its customer service jobs from the US to a call center in Mumbai. She was stunned that the jobs were going overseas - and that taxpayer dollars were funding the migration. So Turner introduced legislation to ban the outsourcing of any state contracts to foreign countries. Word of Turner's actions rippled across the Internet. Over the last year, she says, she's received more than 2,000 letters and emails from around the country - mostly from programmers. "I had no idea what these people were going through with outsourcing in the private sector," Turner told me at her district office in Ewing, New Jersey, just outside Trenton. Turner's bill passed the state senate by a 40-to-0 vote. But it got bottled up in the assembly, thanks to the efforts of Indian IT firms and their powerhouse Washington, DC, lobbying firm, Hill & Knowlton. However, eFunds, chastened by the bad publicity and eager for more state contracts, moved its call center from Mumbai to Camden, New Jersey. And this former small-time civil servant found herself articulating what might be the political philosophy of the Pissed-Off Programmer. Turner's office is decorated in early politico. Framed pieces of legislation hang on the wall. Large New Jersey and US flags stand behind her imposing desk. Her credenzas are crammed with photos of herself rubbing shoulders with various dignitaries, including three shots of her clasping hands with Bill Clinton. She's good at what she does - so smart and likable that she can make what many would consider retrograde views sound eminently reasonable. After talking to her for 10 minutes, I think, if Ross Perot had picked her as his running mate, he might have had a shot."We can't stop globalization," Turner says. But outsourcing, especially now, amounts to "contributing to our own demise." When jobs go overseas, governments lose income tax revenue - and that makes it even harder to assist those who need a hand. Losing IT jobs has particularly frightful consequences. In a jittery world, "it's really foolish for us to become so dependent on any foreign country for those kinds of jobs," she says. What's more, she continues, it imperils the US middle class. "If we keep going in this direction, we'll have just two classes in our society - the very, very rich and the very, very poor. We're going to look like some of the countries we're outsourcing to."Her solution is simple: America first. Support American firms. Put Americans back to work. And only then, after we reach full employment, will outsourcing be an acceptable option. "If we can't take care of our own first, we shouldn't be looking to take care of other people around the world," she says. "If you're a parent, you don't take care of everybody on the block before you make sure your own children have their basic needs met."It all sounds so 20 years ago - when the threat to economic prosperity and national sovereignty was not Indian coders but Japanese autoworkers. Back then, the predictions were equally alarmist - the "hollowing out" of America, people called it. And the prescriptions were equally blunt - trade sanctions and "Buy America" campaigns. So I toss a slur across her desk. I call her a protectionist."Oh, and I'm proud of it," she responds. "I wear that badge with honor. I am a protectionist. I want to protect America. I want to protect jobs for Americans.""But isn't part of this country's vitality its ability to make these kinds of changes?" I counter. "We've done it before - going from farm to factory, from factory to knowledge work, and from knowledge work to whatever's next."She looks at me. Then she says, "I'd like to know where you go from knowledge." Another day, another global menace. Today I'm at Patni, the software company where Aparna Jairam worked for two years in the late '90s. Patni's headquarters sits in another section of Mumbai - and as at Hexaware, the contrast between inside and outside is stark. Its interior is Silicon Valley circa 1999 - curvy door handles, funky chairs, a rooftop patio, and a pool table. But when I glance out an office window, just beyond the sidewalk I see a family living in a makeshift dwelling of plywood and tattered plastic. Patni differs from Hexaware in a few important ways. For starters, it's bigger. Patni is India's sixth-largest software and services exporter; Hexaware ranks 18th. Patni employs about 6,500 people in offices all over the world and has a long-standing relationship with GE and a $100 million investment from the venture capital firm General Atlantic Partners. It also has a more secretive atmosphere. I'm not allowed to ask certain questions (including how much money the workers earn). When I set up my tape recorder for interviews, my ever present Patni minder pulls out his own tape recorder. Although security cameras abound, I'm not allowed on certain floors unless Patni's director of security accompanies me. Yet for all this muscle-flexing, Patni remains a relative pipsqueak. Its 2002 revenue was about $188 million. That same year, the American IT firm EDS hauled in revenue of $21.5 billion. There's something adolescent about Patni - indeed, about many Indian IT firms. They're growing quickly, but they still don't quite seem like full-fledged adults. From an Indian perspective, though, this moment is understandably invigorating. The country now has the second-fastest-growing economy in the world. Within four years, IT outsourcing will be a $57 billion annual industry - responsible for 7 percent of India's GDP and employing some 4 million people. But from an American perspective, the threat this poses seems pretty meager. A $57 billion market represents about 0.5 percent of US GDP. And for added perspective, it's important to continue looking out those windows. India has a long way to go. Nearly a quarter of the country lives in poverty. The telecommunications infrastructure is subpar. And modernity stands just steps away from ancient animosities. The week I was in Mumbai, global business guru and former MIT dean Lester Thurow was in town trumpeting the possibilities of "Brand India" - as militants planted bombs in taxis and killed 53 people.Nonetheless, as with all adolescents, through the gangliness and overconfidence you can glimpse the contours of the future. Patni's hallways are filled with the air of inevitability. Project manager Aditya Deshmukh worked in Baltimore and New Jersey for three years but has no desire to return to the States; India's where the action is. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies are already outsourcing work to India. One reason: Nearly every educated person here speaks English. For India - especially in its competition with China, where few have mastered Western languages - English is the killer app. This company and this industry will undoubtedly grow bigger, stronger, and smarter. That represents a threat to the status quo in the US. But such threats are an established pattern in our history. As Deshmukh reminds me before I have a chance to cover my ears and flee, "Change is the only constant." A century ago, 40 percent of Americans worked on farms. Today, the farm sector employs about 3 percent of our workforce. But our agriculture economy still outproduces all but two countries. Fifty years ago, most of the US labor force worked in factories. Today, only about 14 percent is in manufacturing. But we've still got the largest manufacturing economy in the world - worth about $1.9 trillion in 2002. We've seen this movie before - and it's always had a happy ending. The only difference this time is that the protagonists are forging pixels instead of steel. And accountants, financial analysts, and other number crunchers, prepare for your close-up. Your jobs are next. After all, to export sneakers or sweatshirts, companies need an intercontinental supply chain. To export software or spreadsheets, somebody just needs to hit Return.What makes this latest upheaval so disorienting for Americans is its speed. Agriculture jobs provided decent livelihoods for at least 80 years before the rules changed and working in the factory became the norm. Those industrial jobs endured for some 40 years before the twin pressures of cheap competition overseas and labor-saving automation at home rewrote the rules again. IT jobs - the kind of high-skill knowledge work that was supposed to be our future - are facing the same sort of realignment after only 20 years or so. The upheaval is occurring not across generations, but within individual careers. The rules are being rewritten while people are still playing the game. And that seems unjust.Couple those changed rules with the ham-fisted public relations of the American companies doing the outsourcing and it's understandable why programmers are so pissed. It makes sense that they're lashing out at the H1-B and L-1 visas. US immigration policies are a proxy for forces that are harder to identify and combat. It's easier to attack visible laws than it is to restrain the invisible hand. To be sure, many of these policies, especially the L-1, have been abused. American programmers have done an effective job of highlighting these abuses - and during an election year, Congress will likely enact some reforms. But even if these visa programs were eliminated altogether, not much would change in the long run.Patni's head of human resources, Miland Jadhav, compares the Pissed-Off Programmers' efforts to the protests that greeted Pizza Hut's arrival in India. When the chain opened, some people "went around smashing windows and doing all kinds of things," but their cause ultimately did not prevail. Why? Demand. "You cannot tell Indian people to stop eating at Pizza Hut," he says. "It won't happen." Likewise, if some kinds of work can be done just as well for a lot cheaper somewhere other than the US, that's where US companies will send the work. The reason: demand. And if we don't like it, then it's time to return our iPods (assembled in Taiwan), our cell phones (manufactured in Korea), and our J. Crew shirts (sewn in Indonesia). We can't have it both ways.Still, if you're 61 years old, it makes sense to borrow a page from Charlie Chaplin and try to throw a wrench into the machine. John Bauman is 61 years old. More than a year ago, Northeast Utilities fired Bauman and 200 other IT consultants. From his home in Meriden, Connecticut, he created the Organization for the Rights of American Workers. The mission: to protest H1-B and L-1 visas. He feels that if he can slow things down, he stands a chance. When I speak to him by phone one afternoon, I offer the standard defense of globalization and free trade - that they disrupt in the short term but enrich over time. But it's hard to make this argument with much gusto to a man who, faced with his unemployment benefits running out, had to take a temporary job delivering boxes for FedEx. The invisible hand is giving him the finger. A compassionate society must somehow help its John Baumans. But the rest of us, like it or not, will have to adjust. The hints about how to make this adjustment are evident at Patni. As I meet programmers and executives, I hear lots of talk about quality and focus and ISO and CMM certifications and getting the details right. But never - not once - does anybody mention innovation, creativity, or changing the world. Again, it reminds me of Japan in the '80s - dedicated to continuous improvement but often at the expense of bolder leaps of possibility. And therein lies the opportunity for Americans. It's inevitable that certain things - fabrication, maintenance, testing, upgrades, and other routine knowledge work - will be done overseas. But that leaves plenty for us to do. After all, before these Indian programmers have something to fabricate, maintain, test, or upgrade, that something first must be imagined and invented. And these creations must be explained to customers and marketed to suppliers and entered into the swirl of commerce in a fashion that people notice, all of which require aptitudes that are more difficult to outsource - imagination, empathy, and the ability to forge relationships. After a week in India, it seems clear that the white-collar jobs with any lasting potential in the US won't be classically high tech. Instead, they'll be high concept and high touch.Indeed, Kirwin, the programmer in Delaware, partly confirms my suspicion. After he lost his job at J.P. Morgan, he collected unemployment for three months before he found a new job at a financial services company he prefers not to name. He's now an IT designer, not a programmer. The job is more complex than merely cranking code. He must understand the broader imperatives of the business and relate to a range of people. "It's more of a synthesis of skills," he says, rather than a commodity that can be replicated in India. Kirwin still believes the job is "offshorable," though I'm less certain. And he's earning less than he did at J.P. Morgan, though the downturn is much to blame for that, as it is for at least part of the broader anxiety that programmers are feeling.But Kirwin does begin to address Senator Turner's question. Back in New Jersey, she introduced what appeared to be an unanswerable riddle: What comes after knowledge? The answer, perhaps, is an update of the slogan that appears in giant steel-and-neon letters on the Trenton Bridge, just a few miles from Turner's office. That slogan, affixed to the bridge in 1935 to proclaim the region's manufacturing strength, reads TRENTON MAKES - THE WORLD TAKES. Now that the rest of the world is acquiring knowledge, and we're moving to work that is high concept and high touch, where innovation is essential but the path from breakthrough to commodity is swift, the more appropriate slogan - of both admonition and possibility - might be this: AMERICA DISCOVERS. THE WORLD DELIVERS.It's a soggy, breezy Saturday afternoon - and I'm hanging out with Aparna Jairam and her husband, Janish, in their comfortable sixth-floor flat in suburban Mumbai. Janish, who also works in the IT industry, is a genial fellow whose laid-back friendliness nicely complements his wife's quiet intensity. We're drinking tea, eating vadas, and discussing the future."Someday," Janish says, "another nation will take business from India." Perhaps China or the Philippines, which are already competing for IT work."When that happens, how will you respond?" I ask."I think you must have read Who Moved My Cheese?" Aparna says to my surprise. Janish gets up from the couch, and to my still greater surprise, pulls a copy from the bookshelf. Who Moved My Cheese? is, of course, one of the best-selling books of the past decade. It's a simpleminded - and, yes, cheesy - parable about the inevitability of change. The book (booklet is more like it - the $20 hardcover is roughly the length of this article) is a fable about two mouselike critters, Hem and Haw, who live in a maze and love cheese. After years of finding their cheese in the same place every day, they arrive one morning to discover that it's gone. Hem, feeling victimized, wants to wait until somebody puts the cheese back. Haw, anxious but realistic, wants to find new cheese. The moral: Be like Haw. Janish gave Aparna a copy of the book for their wedding anniversary last year. (He inscribed it, "I am one cheese which won't move.") She read it on a Hexaware commuter bus one morning and calls it "superb." The lesson for Aparna was clear: The good times for Indian IT workers won't last forever. And when those darker days arrive, "We should just keep moving with the times and not be cocooned in our little world. That's the way life is." Or as Haw more chirpily explains to his partner, "Sometimes, Hem, things change and they are never the same. This looks like one of those times. That's life! Life moves on. And so should we."If you're among the pissed off, such advice - especially coming from talking rodents chasing cheddar around a maze - may sound annoying. But it's not entirely wrong. So if Hem and Haw make you hurl, return to where Aparna began when I met her that first day - the sacred text of Hinduism, the Bhagavad Gita, whose 700 verses many Indians know by heart. The Gita opens with two armies facing each other across a field of battle. One of the warriors is Prince Arjuna, who discovers that his charioteer is the Hindu god Krishna. The book relates the dialog between the god and the warrior - about how to survive and, more important, how to live. One stanza seems apt in this moment of fear and discontent. "Your very nature will drive you to fight," Lord Krishna tells Arjuna. "The only choice is what to fight against."   Source: Daniel H. Pink,wired.com, 02/01/04

       Statistics   urlLink     urlLink   urlLink    Among the grand gothic columns of Bangalore's colonial-era urban administration office, a couple dozen village dwellers neatly dressed in cotton shirts, sarongs, and turbans wait their turn at what looks like an automatic teller machine. But this machine isn't dispensing cash. Instead, farmers from nearby villages can use the terminal to see computerized copies of the deeds to the tiny patches of wheat, rice, and vegetables they till for a living. Once they've checked their information, they can get a printed copy of their records at a neighboring window for just 30 cents.That's a big change. Until the records were computerized, the deeds were controlled by powerful village accountants. These men routinely charged poor farmers anywhere from $2 to $22 for a copy -- which they typically need two or three times a year when they ask banks for loans to pay for fertilizer, seeds, and crop insurance. Worse, some accountants would even collude with upper-caste landlords to steal the land by writing over the original names and then tricking illiterate, lower-caste farmers into signing away their property by putting their thumbprints on the deeds.Five years ago, the Karnataka state government launched a program to computerize the land records of 6.7 million farmers in 30,000 villages. Two years later, all 20 million deeds had been digitized and filed along with information such as the land's productive capacity and any loans that use the property as collateral. Today, the information is available in Kannada, the local language, through 200 government-owned computer kiosks in administrative offices across the state. Muniratnama, a cheerful 45-year-old farmer, traveled 15 kilometers from her village to Bangalore for a copy of her land record so she could get a loan to replant her 1.6 hectares. The new system, she says, is far better than the old way. "The village accountant was corrupt," she says with disgust. "He'd delay making any changes, and he made mistakes, too."Computerizing land records may not seem like much of an achievement; most developed countries did it years ago. But in rural India, where the majority of people are semi-literate and live in remote communities unconnected by road or phone, it's almost a revolution. "With equal access to information, a lower-caste person now has the same privileges as an upper-caste person," says Rajiv Chawla, who oversaw the $3.7 million program, called Bhoomi -- which means "land" in both Hindi and Kannada. In Karnataka alone, for instance, deed fraud once cost poor farmers $20 million a year; today, the problem has been virtually wiped out, according to the World Bank. With all the information digitized, land reform -- which had slowed because limited access to records made it hard to prove ownership -- could now be restarted. And the data can be mined for commercial information: A tractor maker, aiming to better target its marketing efforts, recently asked for the names of communities where most farms are larger than four hectares. Soon, says Chawla, the government will begin charging for that sort of information. Even now, though, the Bhoomi program earns $2.6 million a year from the 30 cents fees.Such initiatives add up to a digital turning point for India.     For the past decade, the country's high-tech sector has boomed, with outsourcing companies and software shops popping up like mushrooms in tech capitals such as Bangalore and Hyderabad. But that growth has largely left India's 700 million impoverished villagers, slum dwellers, and tenant farmers just as poor as their forefathers were for centuries. Jobs are scarce, cash is scarcer, and simply getting water is an immense daily challenge. This huge gulf between India's thriving elite and its vast hinterland is one reason the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lost the general election this spring. The victorious Congress Party has pledged to deliver prosperity to the masses -- a stupendously difficult task in India. Although the BJP planned to shell out $3 billion over the next three years to computerize government services across the nation, it will now fall to Congress to implement the plan and see that it improves the lives of ordinary Indians. "The government's challenge is to leverage India's technological and manpower potential to solve our problems of poverty and actually deliver services to the masses," says R. Chandrashekar, who oversees e-governance programs at India's Information Technology Ministry.In the fight against poverty, the policymakers of Congress may find natural allies among the more altruistic of India's digital generation. Even before the BJP lost the election, many of the educated elite responsible for the success of India's tech and software houses -- or who have helped U.S. multinationals prosper -- decided to turn their energies to helping India's poor. Nasscom, the trade group for India's software houses, estimates that there are hundreds of such programs across India, many of them private initiatives, connected by a common theme: to find cheap, digital solutions to the problems pressing on the poor. They range from a "smart chip" payment card for the working poor to a diagnostic kit for isolated health clinics to a successful e-commerce initiative that lets farmers buy supplies and get market information online. "it can act as a bridge between the rapidly growing new India and the lagging old India," says Nasscom President Kiran Karnik. "We have to figure a way to take these sparks and turn them into a prairie fire."For a decade, such efforts were merely experiments -- small-scale, splintered acts of charity and attempts at business creation. And many have been hindered by government inertia or regulation. But some have become successful and are starting to look like valid business opportunities. Now, the entrepreneurs are starting to discover one another: India has this year been host to three conferences on the use of technology for development in rural societies. So far, most of these ventures have been funded with entrepreneurs' savings because venture capitalists see few prospects of early returns. With the number of success stories growing, though, Nasscom and the World Bank are planning a fund of up to $1 billion to support promising ideas. And other developing nations such as South Africa, Brazil, and Sri Lanka are closely watching India's progress to see whether the projects can be successfully replicated. "India could lead the world in creating the grassroots social experiments that could teach both India and other nations how to use technology for the common good," says Kenneth Keniston, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who follows such experiments globally.Stretching ResourcesMany of these efforts are driven by the urge to profit: If a fraction of India's poor logged in or dialed up just once a day -- and paid a minuscule fee to a service provider for the privilege -- then the sheer mass could create a viable business. "If you can conceptualize the world's 4 billion poor as a market, rather than as a burden, they must be considered the biggest source of growth left in the world," says C.K. Prahalad, a leading management theorist who studies developing markets. Other pioneers are purely altruistic -- they want to break India's millennia-long curse of poverty.It's an awesome curse, and at first look, it's hard to see how digital technology cooked up by some entrepreneurial do-gooders can relieve hunger or thirst or guarantee a better crop. No laptop, however cheap or durable, can compensate for India's lack of a nationwide power grid, or a comprehensive network of highways. But digital technology can deliver information -- information the rural poor desperately need -- about crop conditions, fertilizer prices, health care, and more. Reliable information can help India's poor stretch their resources -- to plant the right crops, deal with bureaucrats more effectively, operate on a level playing field with customers and merchants. The digital revolution in India is largely an information revolution.Computer kiosks are at the center of all this. These are typically in the front room of an entrepreneur's home, with one or two pcs linked to the Internet via a satellite, phone, or wireless link. The country already has some 7,000 such kiosks, and more than 100 new ones pop up each week. By 2007 there could be as many as 300,000, estimates Nasscom. The giant Indian Tobacco Co. has taken the lead in this movement: The company has funded more than 4,000 kiosks so far, giving them to farmers in a bid to boost sales of everything from seeds to soap via its Web site, e-Choupal. But new players are emerging, offering eager entrepreneurs a chance to open kiosks as a business. N-Logue Communications, for instance, has adopted something of a franchise model. The company arranges a low-interest loan of $1,000 to buy a computer and install a wireless link to the Internet. Then it teaches the kiosk owner its possibilities: Net-based education, computer training for local children, videoconferencing, photo work, and more.These kiosks often become the hub of village activity. Take the one operated by Mahesh Patel, a soybean and cotton farmer from Korgala, a speck of a village in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. Although the only place Patel had ever seen a computer was in Bollywood blockbusters screened at the cinema in a nearby town, he jumped at the chance when Indian Tobacco offered him the Korgala kiosk three years ago. Since he gets a small cut of every sale ITC makes via his computer, Patel's monthly income has jumped to $380 from $220 before he got the kiosk. His three-room home is now often crowded with villagers: Early in the morning, Patel and fellow farmers gather to check soy oil prices in Kuala Lumpur and Chicago via the machine's satellite Internet connection before looking into the going rate on local markets. In the afternoon, village children hone their computer skills on the machine. And since the e-Choupal site offers all kinds of goods for sale, Patel's house has become a virtual village store. "I'm just a farmer, but I get a lot of respect in my village now," he says.Today, entrepreneurs in India are looking to capitalize on the kiosk boom. Many are working on projects that could make kiosks more useful to villagers, or extend their reach to more isolated locales. "India is no longer just a laboratory for these experiments," says Allen Hammond, vice-president for innovation at the World Resources Institute in Washington. "It's out of the pilot stage and ready to scale up."Some believe kiosks can help ordinary Indians get better access to health care. Already, a handful of rural clinics have satellite video and data links to city hospitals. But Sameer Sawarkar believes the kiosks can serve as part-time clinics as well. The 31-year-old engineering grad from the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore remembered the lack of medical care in his home village. So in 2002 the former Motorola Inc. (MOT ) researcher joined some friends to develop a portable $200 diagnostic kit the size of a boombox that can check blood pressure, temperature, and pulse, take an electrocardiogram, and work as an electronic stethoscope. The machine can be plugged into kiosk computers to transfer diagnostic information to a city hospital. Sawarkar now has a deal with N-Logue to install them in some of its locations.Handhelds and Wi-FiOthers believe that handheld computers offer a way to extend the benefits of technology beyond the reach of typical desktops, or even laptops. Microsoft, for instance, is exploring the possibility of a $150 handheld device for the Bhoomi land records program, and the government of Andhra Pradesh has bought palmtops from Casio for school officials to keep attendance records. A high-profile Indian initiative is the Simputer, a simple, robust handheld computer that even illiterate farmers can use to pay bills, send e-mail, and keep records of their business using symbols or any of the 17 official Indian languages. It even has education programs in five languages and can turn text into speech. The device was developed under a public license not unlike the Linux operating system it uses. The professors at Bangalore's Indian Institute of Science who came up with the idea have posted the machine's plans on the Internet for anyone to use, and charge only $25,000 for a manufacturing license in India. One company, Bangalore-based Pico Peta, is selling the machines for $200 to $450. Simputers haven't exactly been jumping off the shelves. Since 2002, the Karnataka government has given Simputers to 200 village accountants and farmers to maintain its Bhoomi land record program. About 25 governments around the world have shown interest in the machines, and inside India Pico Peta has sold 200 more since March. But the promoters are optimistic, keeping their eye on a potential order for 9,000 more handhelds from the Karnataka government, as well as the possibility of sales to other Indian states, which must have their land records computerized by 2006. "When we developed the Simputer, our aim was to bridge the digital divide," says Vinay Deshpande, a co-creator of the device. "Other [Western] companies did it for commercial purposes."Anurag Gupta, meanwhile, has developed a payment card that can plug into either a handheld or a kiosk -- and make it easier for the poor to establish a credit history. Today, it can be tough for many Indians to get loans because they use cash to buy virtually everything, and few have bank accounts. Under Gupta's plan, poor Indians could establish a bank account linked to the card, which contains a smart chip with personal information. Gupta hopes to install card readers in public phone booths and distribute the readers to kiosk owners, who would accept the card as a form of payment for computer time. Cardholders could also use it to pay bills or buy goods online. Banks could then monitor the user's spending patterns and decide whether he or she is a good credit risk. Gupta, a slight, intense man who studied architecture, has been working on the idea for four years. It will finally launch commercially under the name "Zero" on July 7 in Andhra Pradesh with the backing of ICICI Bank. Says Gupta: "It's been a long slog, but we've finally got the support that'll bring success."At the same time, Praveen Bhagwat wants to extend the reach of kiosks with Wi-Fi. Bhagwat, a former wireless researcher for IBM and Bell Laboratories in the U.S., returned to his native India to adapt the wireless standard for rural use. By rewriting some software and redesigning antennae, he made a system that could send signals some 23 kilometers rather than the 100 meters typical for standard Wi-Fi -- meaning that it could provide Internet and phone service to several adjoining villages or a large town. "It's just not economic for large companies to do this. They wouldn't make any money on it," says 35-year-old Bhagwat. "We have to do it for ourselves."Unfortunately, innovators often spend more time struggling against India's bureaucracy than they do coming up with products. Bhagwat, for instance, needed just a month to create his first Wi-Fi system. But then it took nine months to get permission to build six 12-meter towers between the city of Kanpur and neighboring Lucknow, and he still hasn't gotten a permit to extend the system. And P.G. Ponappa, N-Logue's chief executive, says getting permission to put government services such as income and birth certificates online routinely takes a year. The government's "intentions are good, but they're just too slow," he says.Can these projects transform India? Not by themselves. But if, bit by bit, they can make India's poor a little healthier, a little richer, and a little more literate, the cumulative effect on the country's fortunes could be enormous. The poor are eager for a wave of digital change. Young people across the country -- even in many villages -- are familiar with computers and keen to learn how to use them. These days, education and computers are primary items in every rural family's budget. In the poor, dusty village of Shahpur in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, impoverished farmers save their rupees to send their children to school in the neighboring town of Barabanki. There they can study English and computers, which are considered key to prosperity. Among India's poor, there's no shortage of ambition to learn them both. And no shortage of ideas on how to harness technology to give the poor a fighting chance to improve themselves.    Source:Manjeet Kripalani, Business Week, June 28, 2004

        Game designers in India during a discussion    urlLink       Sachin Garud, a 28-year-old computer animator, spends a good part of his day staring at a screen while trying to get a cartoon bull named Ferny to talk. Although the operation is entirely digital, the work is nonetheless laborious. Garud, who is employed by a Bombay studio called Crest Communication, has to manipulate Ferny's lip movements to match the words the character speaks in Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks, an Emmy Award-nominated cartoon serial on America's PBS network. While Garud handles Ferny's lip-synching, a colleague is in charge of the movements of other taurine body parts; another is making one of Ferny's friends, a sheep named Wiley, come to life. The work might be time consuming and repetitive, but Garud insists that it has its little pleasures. "It's a lot of fun getting Ferny to sing," he says. Animators like Garud typically earn salaries ranging from $3,500 to $30,000 a year, much less than the $40,000 to $100,000 they'd pocket if they worked in the U.S. But no one at Crest is complaining. India's animators have never had it so good. In what could be the country's next outsourcing boom, a growing number of American companies are looking to India as a place where they can get high-quality computer-generated animation done on the cheap. Orders for cartoon serials, computer games, direct-to-home DVDs and demonstration videos are pouring into India; at least nine cartoon serials aimed at the American and European markets are in production. "The amount of work coming into India is phenomenal," says Rajiv Sangari, director of the animation unit at Padmalaya Telefilms, which recently signed a $14 million deal with Mondo TV, an Italian company, to produce more than a hundred episodes of an animated TV series. Although India's tech companies and call centers could sell $12 billion worth of software and services to foreigners this year, insiders estimate that the animation industry makes only about $150 million in annual revenues. But executives expect sales to at least double this year and to keep growing exponentially. Animation studios are sprouting throughout India—there are at least 70 already in operation—and companies are on a hiring spree. Sangari, for example, says Padmalaya Telefilms currently has 160 animators but aims to increase staff to 400 within a month. Even that won't be enough, so he's planning to fly in 25 animators from the Philippines to help out. American TV and film companies have been outsourcing animation work to South Korea and the Philippines for more than a decade, but India has managed to muscle into the business, thanks to technological advances and shifting American tastes. Although many animated films and TV programs still use traditional animation, which begins with hand-sketched images on paper, the success of movies such as Shrek and Toy Story has meant that films and TV serials are increasingly being digitally animated, produced entirely on computers using 3-D graphics. That's a boon for India, with its expertise in software and computer skills. While creative control is retained in the U.S.—a team of American master animators comes up with the look of each character, and scriptwriters determine the plots and dialogue—the task of creating each episode is outsourced to Indian animators, allowing the American company to lower its costs by up to 50%. A typical half-hour 3-D cartoon episode can cost $70,000 to $100,000 to produce in India compared with $170,000 to $250,000 in the U.S. The economics are compelling, but it's still been difficult for India's animators to gain the acceptance of clients who don't think of India as an animation center. A.K. Madhavan, Crest's CEO, recalls fruitless sales trips he made to the U.S. in 1999 and 2000. "Had we known how tough it would be to get a breakthrough," Madhavan admits in retrospect, "we might not have kept going." Persistence and a little good fortune helped Madhavan get his big break. While in Texas in 2001, he met with an independent animation producer named Mike Young, who happens to share Madhavan's passion for cricket. The two bonded and Young agreed to watch a test animation clip done by Crest. He liked what he saw—and gave Crest the order for the Jakers! show. Currently, the studio has contracts to animate three serials destined for American TV. It helps that the stigma once associated with "made-in-India" goods and services is evaporating, thanks to the success of software outsourcing giants such as Infosys and Wipro. "Earlier, you had to spend most of your time selling India and a little time selling your company," says Biren Ghose, CEO of Bombay-based Animation Bridge. "Now, I don't have to sell India. I can start selling my company straight away." Because of globalization, cultural differences that affect production values—the look and feel of programs—are rapidly disappearing, too. "Ten years ago, when Bugs Bunny said, 'What's the hubbub, bub?,' most Indians would not have got it," says Nilesh Sardesai, creative director at Crest. "But today, they do," because Indian society has opened to foreign influences. The animation boom is cascading throughout India's entertainment industry. One offshoot has been the rise of computer-game outsourcing. In the Bangalore offices of Dhruva Interactive, a group of twentysomethings sit with comic books and programming manuals while their computer screens flash with images of G.I.s carrying machine guns, teenagers shooting pool in smoky halls, ogres and medieval labyrinths. They're developing games that will be sold to Dhruva clients such as Microsoft. While some Indian animation companies are looking to expand into computer games, others, emboldened by the success of Crest, are dreaming of the big money: digitally animated films. Rajesh Turakhia, CEO of Maya Entertainment, a Bombay-based studio, says that Indian companies will next target smaller Hollywood 3-D animation films with budgets of $10 million to $20 million. India's ambitions could be thwarted by a shortage of skilled animators. Experts estimate that India has only about 4,000 animators who can handle complex projects—which is woefully inadequate for all the work coming in. "We need at least another 2,000 to 3,000 animators this year, but I'm not seeing that many new people in this business," says Animation Bridge's Ghose. One problem, complains Rajesh Rao, the CEO of Dhruva Interactive, is that few of India's art schools and engineering colleges offer computer animation courses. Another barrier facing the industry is cultural. "The Indian mentality is that if I have to put my child into a science or engineering school, I am happy. But we don't want our children to go into art or culture as a profession," says Padmalaya's Sangari. The shortage of talent has raised concern that some clients could grow disillusioned with the quality of work they receive from Indian animators. "Many in the industry do not know how they will execute all these orders," says Sangari. India may not have much time to adapt. China, Russia and the Ukraine are rapidly emerging as rivals. One Indian executive laments that he just lost out on a contract unexpectedly after offering to do the job at the standard Indian rate of $4,000 per month for each animator; a Russian competitor undercut him, agreeing to do it for just $1,800 per person. India's schools will have to start churning out thousands of qualified animators each year—before a new generation of Russian and Chinese animators figures out the fine art of making cartoon bulls talk.

      Here comes the spiderman with Dhoti   urlLink     Even superheroes aren't safe from job outsourcing anymore. Next month Marvel Comics will launch "Spider-Man India," the first ethnic adaptation of the popular comic-book series. Peter Parker of New York City becomes Pavitr Prabhakar of Mumbai, Mary Jane becomes Meera Jain and the villainous Norman Osbourne (a.k.a. the Green Goblin) turns into Nalin Oberoi. But the reinvention goes further: Spider-Man has been transformed from an allegorical figure representing the dangers of scientific experimentation into a hero trying to navigate a modern India steeped in Hindu mysticism. The hero gets his powers from a yogi who performs a ritual on him to access the "web of life," and the villain is a demon from the Hindu pantheon of gods. Prabhakar wears a dhoti, a loincloth favored by Hindu-temple devotees. "I was trying to capture the essence of India," says Jeevan Kang, the 26-year-old former architect hired to draw the series. "I looked at a lot of artwork on mythological characters and tried to intertwine that with the characters here." It's a blending of cultures that Marvel Comics sees as natural—and profitable. "India is very rich in graphical mythology, and that plays well to the superhero ethos," says Marvel Comics president Gui Karyo. At the same time, India—with a population of 1 billion—has a rapidly growing middle class and a burgeoning interest in Western culture. In 2002, 32-year-old Sharad Devarajan launched Bangalore-based Gotham Entertainment to publish Marvel, DC, Dark Horse and Warner Brothers comic books on the Indian Subcontinent. Since then, the company has ramped up circulation to about half a million copies each month of such titles as "Superman," "Batman" and, of course, "Spider-Man." Gotham and Marvel have distributed some U.S. comics, including "Scooby-Doo" and "Wonder Woman." But by Indianizing "Spider-Man," they hope to win over a larger audience and demonstrate their sensitivity to India's rich culture. "We are a business that manages intellectual property, so there were definitely concerns [about tinkering with the character]," says Karyo. "But there was also acknowledgment that you can have the same character interpreted differently." Kang was an obvious choice for the reinterpretation. Before being drafted by Marvel for "Spider-Man India," he had been working on a comic-book version of the Ramayana, a Hindu epic in which the hero battles the demon-king Ravana. For "Spider-Man India," Kang turned the Green Goblin into a modern-day reinvention of Ravana, who gets his powers by performing a forbidden fire ritual. But diehard fans, rest assured: Spider-Man remains a force to be reckoned with, loincloth or no.   Source: Newsweek

      Indian star  urlLink      urlLink     It was the most dramatic scene the Indian Parliament had ever witnessed. On the night of May 14, some 150 of the newly elected members of the Indian National Congress and allied parties took the podium one by one and begged Sonia Gandhi to accept the position of Prime Minister. Gandhi -- the Congress Party President -- watched the drama unfold for four hours. But nothing would change her mind. "I have listened to my inner voice," she quietly told her supporters. She would continue as party leader and would work for the millions of Indians who voted for Congress in the May national election -- dealing a surprise defeat to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led government. But the new government would not be run by her. Instead, she named as prime minister her trusted adviser, former Finance Minister Manmohan Singh.Gandhi was clearly the architect of the Congress victory. The Italian-born widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1991 (and the daughter-in-law of the previously assassinated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi), Sonia Gandhi appeared before huge crowds at more than 160 rallies during the three-month election campaign. Dressed in a cotton sari and often joined by her son, Rahul, 33, and daughter, Priyanka, 31, she traveled to India's villages, listening to the troubles of the poor. Her campaigning persuaded voters to reject the BJP's promises of a "shining India" and back Congress' social and rural agenda.By turning down the top office, Gandhi sets a new tone for public life in India. For much of its 55 years of independence, India has been mired in political corruption. Now ordinary Indians hope that Gandhi, who has never held high office and has a clean reputation, will tackle corruption and speed up India's development. Says Sanjay Kumar, a fellow at New Delhi's Center for the Study of Developing Societies: "Sonia Gandhi will try and ensure the image of the government as one that cares for the common man."With Congress barely six weeks in power, Gandhi is already signaling the role she intends to play. She is leaving policy decisions to Singh and his team of liberal economists, although she will have some say behind the scenes. Gandhi will focus on the politics of managing her resurgent party and a fragile coalition of 18 partners. Her first test comes in July, when she embarks on a month-long journey across rural India, to reestablish Congress' position in densely populated but poor states such as Uttar Pradesh. She'll confer with village leaders, who will soon benefit from the new government's huge development budget. "Her priorities are clear: Keep the Congress and its allies stable, and support social welfare programs without dragging our feet on economic reform," says Salman Khursheed, her aide.India's most powerful woman rarely speaks to the media. Intensely shy, she retreated into private life after her husband's death. But Congress could not find a leader capable of uniting the party. So party elders begged her to enter politics. In 1998, she relented, becoming party chief and later opposition leader in Parliament. She worked 16-hour days and familiarized herself with key issues. She developed into a passionate speaker, increasingly comfortable in Hindi. And she revamped the party, requiring key state ministers to submit performance reviews and insisting that contributions to party coffers be scrupulously accounted for -- a move that improved Congress' image.Gandhi, who has only a high school education, makes no claim to be an intellectual. Her great strength is her commitment to fair play and decency. If she keeps that focus, she will make her mark.   Source: Business Week-Asia Edition,July 12,2004

       Meet the pissed-off programmer. If you've picked up a newspaper in the last six months, watched CNN, or even glanced at Slashdot, you've already heard his anguished cry.   He's the guy - and, yeah, he's usually a guy - launching Web sites like yourjobisgoingtoindia.com and nojobsforindia.com. He's the guy telling tales - many of them true, a few of them urban legends - about American programmers being forced to train their Indian replacements. Because of him, India's commerce and industry minister flew to Washington in June to assure the Bush administration that Indian coders were not bent on destroying American livelihoods. And for the past year, he's the guy who's been picketing corporate outsourcing conferences, holding placards that read WILL CODE FOR FOOD will code for food and chanting, "Shame, shame, shame!" Now meet the cause of all this fear and loathing: Aparna Jairam of Mumbai. She's 33 years old. Her long black hair is clasped with a barrette. Her dark eyes are deep-set and unusually calm. She has the air of the smartest girl in class - not the one always raising her hand and shouting out answers, but the one who sits in back, taking it all in and responding only when called upon, yet delivering answers that make the whole class turn around and listen. In 1992, Jairam graduated from India's University of Pune with a degree in engineering. She has since worked in a variety of jobs in the software industry and is now a project manager at Hexaware Technologies in Mumbai, the city formerly known as Bombay. Jairam specializes in embedded systems software for handheld devices. She leaves her two children with a babysitter each morning, commutes an hour to the office, and spends her days attending meetings, perfecting her team's code, and emailing her main client, a utility company in the western US. Jairam's annual salary is about $11,000 - more than 22 times the per capita annual income in India. Aparna Jairam isn't trying to steal your job. That's what she tells me, and I believe her. But if Jairam does end up taking it - and, let's face facts, she could do your $70,000-a-year job for the wages of a Taco Bell counter jockey - she won't lose any sleep over your plight. When I ask what her advice is for a beleaguered American programmer afraid of being pulled under by the global tide that she represents, Jairam takes the high road, neither dismissing the concern nor offering soothing happy talk. Instead, she recites a portion of the 2,000-year-old epic poem and Hindu holy book the Bhagavad Gita: "Do what you're supposed to do. And don't worry about the fruits. They'll come on their own."  This is a story about the global economy. It's about two countries and one profession - and how weirdly upside down the future has begun to look from opposite sides of the globe. It's about code and the people who write it. But it's also about free markets, new politics, and ancient wisdom - which means it's ultimately about faith. Our story begins beside the murky waters of the Arabian Sea. I've come to Mumbai to see what software programmers in India make of the anti-outsourcing hubbub in the US. Mumbai may not have as many coders per square foot as glossier tech havens like Bangalore and Hyderabad, but there's a lot more real life here. Mumbai is India's largest city - with an official population of 18 million and an actual population incalculably higher. It's a sweltering, magnificent, teeming megalopolis in which every human triumph and affliction shouts at the top of its lungs 24 hours a day.  Jairam's firm, Hexaware, is located in the exurbs of Mumbai in a district fittingly called Navi Mumbai, or New Mumbai. To get there, you fight traffic thicker and more chaotic than rush hour in hell as you pass a staggering stretch of shantytowns. But once inside the Millennium Business Park, which houses Hexaware and several other high tech companies, you've tumbled through a wormhole and landed in northern Virginia or Silicon Valley. The streets are immaculate. The buildings fairly gleam. The lawns are fit for putting. And in the center is an outdoor café bustling with twentysomethings so picture-perfect I look around to see if a film crew is shooting a commercial. Hexaware's headquarters, the workplace of some 500 programmers (another 800 work at a development center in the southern city of Chennai, and 200 more are in Bangalore), is a silvery four-story glass building chock-full of blond-wood cubicles and black Dell computers. In one area, 30 new recruits sit through programming boot camp; down the hall, 25 even newer hires are filling out HR forms. Meanwhile, other young people - the average age here is 27 - tap keyboards and skitter in and out of conference rooms outfitted with whiteboards and enclosed in frosted glass. If you pulled the shades and ignored the accents, you could be in Santa Clara. But it's the talent - coupled with the ridiculously low salaries, of course - that's luring big clients from Europe and North America. The coders here work for the likes of Citibank, Deutsche Leasing, Alliance Capital, Air Canada, HSBC, BP, Princeton University, and several other institutions that won't permit Hexaware to reveal their names.  Jairam works in a first-floor cubicle that's unadorned except for a company policy statement, a charcoal sketch, and a small statue of Ganesh, the elephant-headed Hindu god of knowledge and obstacle removal. Like most employees, Jairam rides to work aboard a private bus, one in a fleet the company dispatches throughout Mumbai to shuttle its workers to the office. Many days she eats lunch in the firm's colorful fourth-floor canteen. While Hexaware's culinary offerings don't measure up to Google's celebrity chef and gourmet fare, the food's not bad - chana saag, aloo gobi, rice, chapatis - and the price is right. A meal costs 22 rupees, about 50 cents. After lunch one Tuesday, I meet in a conference room with Jairam and five colleagues to hear their reactions to the complaints of the Pissed-Off Programmer. I cite the usual statistics: 1 in 10 US technology jobs will go overseas by the end of 2004, according to the research firm Gartner. In the next 15 years, more than 3 million US white-collar jobs, representing $136 billion in wages, will depart to places like India, with the IT industry leading the migration, according to Forrester Research. I relate stories of American programmers collecting unemployment, declaring bankruptcy, even contemplating suicide - because they can't compete with people willing to work for one-sixth of their wages.   The six Hexawarians are sympathetic but unmoved. They disagree with the very premise that cheap labor is hurting the US. And they think it's somewhat laughable that, because things aren't going exactly our way, ordinarily change-infatuated Americans are suddenly decrying change. "Back in the US, it's all about cheap, cheap, cheap. It's not only about India being cheap. It's quality services," says Jairam's colleague Kavita Samudra, who works on applications for the airline industry. "The fact that they're getting a quality product is why people are coming to us."    Ritesh Maniar reminds me that Hexaware has scored a Level 5 rating from Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute, the highest international standard a software company can achieve. The others are quick to note that, of the 70 or so companies in the world that have earned this designation, half are from India. Over several days, here and at other companies, I hear this factoid repeated like a campaign talking point. Translation: We're not just cheaper, we're better.  And that, they say, is good for everyone. Maniar, a senior technical architect, describes one American client: "We helped them become process-oriented, which they were not before. They were spending again and again on the same thing. We explained the process that we follow, because we would like to bring them up to our standards."  "Don't you think we're helping the US economy by doing the work here?" asks an exasperated Lalit Suryawanshi. It frees up Americans to do other things so the economy can grow, adds Jairam. What begins to seep through their well-tiled arguments about quality, efficiency, and optimization is a view that Americans, who have long celebrated the sweetness of dynamic capitalism, must get used to the concept that it works for non-Americans, too. Programming jobs have delivered a nice upper-middle-class lifestyle to the people in this room. They own apartments. They drive new cars. They surf the Internet and watch American television and sip cappuccinos. Isn't the emergence of a vibrant middle class in an otherwise poor country a spectacular achievement, the very confirmation of the wonders of globalization - not to mention a new market for American goods and services? And if this transition pinches a little, aren't Americans being a tad hypocritical by whining about it? After all, where is it written that IT jobs somehow belong to Americans - and that any non-American who does such work is stealing the job from its rightful owner? Maybe these US programmers should simply adjust. That's what Indian textile workers did when their country's government opened its quasi-socialistic economy in 1991, says Jairam. Some people lost jobs. They complained, but they found something else to do. Maniar uncorks an aphorism that he doesn't realize I've heard 8,000 times before (in part because American white-collar workers have long said it to their blue-collar compadres) - and that I don't realize I'll hear several times again during my stay: "There's nothing permanent except change." Back in the US, you can feel the rage. Application developer Mike Emmons of Longwood, Florida, for example, is running for Congress on a platform that calls for the end of outsourcing. Emmons also wants to curtail temporary work visas for immigrant programmers, such as the always controversial H1-B and its stealthier counterpart, the L-1, which he says have cost him and other American programmers their jobs. "These cats will lie through their teeth," Emmons says, referring to incumbent members of Congress like the one he's trying to oust. "They're using immigration to reduce the wages of Americans." Other programmers, once resolutely go-it-alone apolitical types, have formed advocacy groups with righteous names like the Rescue American Jobs Foundation, the Coalition for National Sovereignty and Economic Patriotism, and the Organization for the Rights of American Workers.  One such group has adopted a friendlier title, the Information Technology Professional Association of America. But its founder, 37-year-old Scott Kirwin, voices the same indignation. "I'm very pissed off," he tells me over lunch in Wilmington, Delaware, where he lives. "I want to make people aware of what's going on with outsourcing." Kirwin was a latecomer to the IT world. After college, he lived in Japan for five years, then returned to the States hoping to join the US Foreign Service. He didn't get in. In 1997, he and his wife moved to Wilmington, her hometown, and he took a job at a tech support company outside Philadelphia, where he learned Visual Basic. Kirwin discovered that he loved programming and did it well. By 2000, he was working at J.P. Morgan in Newark, Delaware, providing back-office database services for the firm's bankers around the world. But after Morgan merged with Chase, and the bloom left the boom, the combined firm decided to outsource the responsibilities of Kirwin's department to an Indian company. For nine months, he worked alongside three Indian programmers, all on temporary visas, teaching them his job but expecting to stick around as a manager when the work moved to India. Last March, Kirwin got his pink slip. The experience did more than capsize his work life. It battered his belief system. He's long espoused the virtues of free trade. He says that he supported Nafta and that for 12 years he's subscribed to The Economist, a hymnal in the free trade church. But now he's questioning core beliefs. "These are theories that have really not been tested and proven," he says. "We're using people's lives to do this experiment - to find out what happens." "I'm not religious," he tells me. "But I believe that everyone has to have faith in one thing. And my faith has been in the American system." That conviction is weakening. "Politicians are not aware of the problem that information workers are facing here. And it's not just the IT people. It's going to be anybody. That really worries me. Where does it stop?" Seventy miles up the Northeast Corridor is a politician who is asking that very question - and who, in the process, has become something of a folk hero to programmers like Kirwin. Shirley Turner represents the 15th District in the New Jersey State Senate. In 2002, Turner learned that eFunds, the company that administers electronic benefits cards for the state's welfare recipients, had moved its customer service jobs from the US to a call center in Mumbai. She was stunned that the jobs were going overseas - and that taxpayer dollars were funding the migration. So Turner introduced legislation to ban the outsourcing of any state contracts to foreign countries.    Word of Turner's actions rippled across the Internet. Over the last year, she says, she's received more than 2,000 letters and emails from around the country - mostly from programmers. "I had no idea what these people were going through with outsourcing in the private sector," Turner told me at her district office in Ewing, New Jersey, just outside Trenton.  Turner's bill passed the state senate by a 40-to-0 vote. But it got bottled up in the assembly, thanks to the efforts of Indian IT firms and their powerhouse Washington, DC, lobbying firm, Hill & Knowlton. However, eFunds, chastened by the bad publicity and eager for more state contracts, moved its call center from Mumbai to Camden, New Jersey. And this former small-time civil servant found herself articulating what might be the political philosophy of the Pissed-Off Programmer.  Turner's office is decorated in early politico. Framed pieces of legislation hang on the wall. Large New Jersey and US flags stand behind her imposing desk. Her credenzas are crammed with photos of herself rubbing shoulders with various dignitaries, including three shots of her clasping hands with Bill Clinton. She's good at what she does - so smart and likable that she can make what many would consider retrograde views sound eminently reasonable. After talking to her for 10 minutes, I think, if Ross Perot had picked her as his running mate, he might have had a shot. "We can't stop globalization," Turner says. But outsourcing, especially now, amounts to "contributing to our own demise." When jobs go overseas, governments lose income tax revenue - and that makes it even harder to assist those who need a hand. Losing IT jobs has particularly frightful consequences. In a jittery world, "it's really foolish for us to become so dependent on any foreign country for those kinds of jobs," she says. What's more, she continues, it imperils the US middle class. "If we keep going in this direction, we'll have just two classes in our society - the very, very rich and the very, very poor. We're going to look like some of the countries we're outsourcing to." Her solution is simple: America first. Support American firms. Put Americans back to work. And only then, after we reach full employment, will outsourcing be an acceptable option. "If we can't take care of our own first, we shouldn't be looking to take care of other people around the world," she says. "If you're a parent, you don't take care of everybody on the block before you make sure your own children have their basic needs met." It all sounds so 20 years ago - when the threat to economic prosperity and national sovereignty was not Indian coders but Japanese autoworkers. Back then, the predictions were equally alarmist - the "hollowing out" of America, people called it. And the prescriptions were equally blunt - trade sanctions and "Buy America" campaigns.  So I toss a slur across her desk. I call her a protectionist. "Oh, and I'm proud of it," she responds. "I wear that badge with honor. I am a protectionist. I want to protect America. I want to protect jobs for Americans." "But isn't part of this country's vitality its ability to make these kinds of changes?" I counter. "We've done it before - going from farm to factory, from factory to knowledge work, and from knowledge work to whatever's next." She looks at me. Then she says, "I'd like to know where you go from knowledge."  Another day, another global menace. Today I'm at Patni, the software company where Aparna Jairam worked for two years in the late '90s. Patni's headquarters sits in another section of Mumbai - and as at Hexaware, the contrast between inside and outside is stark. Its interior is Silicon Valley circa 1999 - curvy door handles, funky chairs, a rooftop patio, and a pool table. But when I glance out an office window, just beyond the sidewalk I see a family living in a makeshift dwelling of plywood and tattered plastic.  Patni differs from Hexaware in a few important ways. For starters, it's bigger. Patni is India's sixth-largest software and services exporter; Hexaware ranks 18th. Patni employs about 6,500 people in offices all over the world and has a long-standing relationship with GE and a $100 million investment from the venture capital firm General Atlantic Partners. It also has a more secretive atmosphere. I'm not allowed to ask certain questions (including how much money the workers earn). When I set up my tape recorder for interviews, my ever present Patni minder pulls out his own tape recorder. Although security cameras abound, I'm not allowed on certain floors unless Patni's director of security accompanies me.  Yet for all this muscle-flexing, Patni remains a relative pipsqueak. Its 2002 revenue was about $188 million. That same year, the American IT firm EDS hauled in revenue of $21.5 billion. There's something adolescent about Patni - indeed, about many Indian IT firms. They're growing quickly, but they still don't quite seem like full-fledged adults. From an Indian perspective, though, this moment is understandably invigorating. The country now has the second-fastest-growing economy in the world. Within four years, IT outsourcing will be a $57 billion annual industry - responsible for 7 percent of India's GDP and employing some 4 million people.  But from an American perspective, the threat this poses seems pretty meager. A $57 billion market represents about 0.5 percent of US GDP. And for added perspective, it's important to continue looking out those windows. India has a long way to go. Nearly a quarter of the country lives in poverty. The telecommunications infrastructure is subpar. And modernity stands just steps away from ancient animosities. The week I was in Mumbai, global business guru and former MIT dean Lester Thurow was in town trumpeting the possibilities of "Brand India" - as militants planted bombs in taxis and killed 53 people. Nonetheless, as with all adolescents, through the gangliness and overconfidence you can glimpse the contours of the future. Patni's hallways are filled with the air of inevitability. Project manager Aditya Deshmukh worked in Baltimore and New Jersey for three years but has no desire to return to the States; India's where the action is. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies are already outsourcing work to India. One reason: Nearly every educated person here speaks English. For India - especially in its competition with China, where few have mastered Western languages - English is the killer app. This company and this industry will undoubtedly grow bigger, stronger, and smarter. That represents a threat to the status quo in the US. But such threats are an established pattern in our history. As Deshmukh reminds me before I have a chance to cover my ears and flee, "Change is the only constant."    A century ago, 40 percent of Americans worked on farms. Today, the farm sector employs about 3 percent of our workforce. But our agriculture economy still outproduces all but two countries. Fifty years ago, most of the US labor force worked in factories. Today, only about 14 percent is in manufacturing. But we've still got the largest manufacturing economy in the world - worth about $1.9 trillion in 2002. We've seen this movie before - and it's always had a happy ending. The only difference this time is that the protagonists are forging pixels instead of steel. And accountants, financial analysts, and other number crunchers, prepare for your close-up. Your jobs are next. After all, to export sneakers or sweatshirts, companies need an intercontinental supply chain. To export software or spreadsheets, somebody just needs to hit Return. What makes this latest upheaval so disorienting for Americans is its speed. Agriculture jobs provided decent livelihoods for at least 80 years before the rules changed and working in the factory became the norm. Those industrial jobs endured for some 40 years before the twin pressures of cheap competition overseas and labor-saving automation at home rewrote the rules again. IT jobs - the kind of high-skill knowledge work that was supposed to be our future - are facing the same sort of realignment after only 20 years or so. The upheaval is occurring not across generations, but within individual careers. The rules are being rewritten while people are still playing the game. And that seems unjust. Couple those changed rules with the ham-fisted public relations of the American companies doing the outsourcing and it's understandable why programmers are so pissed. It makes sense that they're lashing out at the H1-B and L-1 visas. US immigration policies are a proxy for forces that are harder to identify and combat. It's easier to attack visible laws than it is to restrain the invisible hand. To be sure, many of these policies, especially the L-1, have been abused. American programmers have done an effective job of highlighting these abuses - and during an election year, Congress will likely enact some reforms. But even if these visa programs were eliminated altogether, not much would change in the long run. Patni's head of human resources, Miland Jadhav, compares the Pissed-Off Programmers' efforts to the protests that greeted Pizza Hut's arrival in India. When the chain opened, some people "went around smashing windows and doing all kinds of things," but their cause ultimately did not prevail. Why? Demand. "You cannot tell Indian people to stop eating at Pizza Hut," he says. "It won't happen." Likewise, if some kinds of work can be done just as well for a lot cheaper somewhere other than the US, that's where US companies will send the work. The reason: demand. And if we don't like it, then it's time to return our iPods (assembled in Taiwan), our cell phones (manufactured in Korea), and our J. Crew shirts (sewn in Indonesia). We can't have it both ways. Still, if you're 61 years old, it makes sense to borrow a page from Charlie Chaplin and try to throw a wrench into the machine. John Bauman is 61 years old. More than a year ago, Northeast Utilities fired Bauman and 200 other IT consultants. From his home in Meriden, Connecticut, he created the Organization for the Rights of American Workers. The mission: to protest H1-B and L-1 visas. He feels that if he can slow things down, he stands a chance. When I speak to him by phone one afternoon, I offer the standard defense of globalization and free trade - that they disrupt in the short term but enrich over time. But it's hard to make this argument with much gusto to a man who, faced with his unemployment benefits running out, had to take a temporary job delivering boxes for FedEx. The invisible hand is giving him the finger. A compassionate society must somehow help its John Baumans.  But the rest of us, like it or not, will have to adjust. The hints about how to make this adjustment are evident at Patni. As I meet programmers and executives, I hear lots of talk about quality and focus and ISO and CMM certifications and getting the details right. But never - not once - does anybody mention innovation, creativity, or changing the world. Again, it reminds me of Japan in the '80s - dedicated to continuous improvement but often at the expense of bolder leaps of possibility.  And therein lies the opportunity for Americans. It's inevitable that certain things - fabrication, maintenance, testing, upgrades, and other routine knowledge work - will be done overseas. But that leaves plenty for us to do. After all, before these Indian programmers have something to fabricate, maintain, test, or upgrade, that something first must be imagined and invented. And these creations must be explained to customers and marketed to suppliers and entered into the swirl of commerce in a fashion that people notice, all of which require aptitudes that are more difficult to outsource - imagination, empathy, and the ability to forge relationships. After a week in India, it seems clear that the white-collar jobs with any lasting potential in the US won't be classically high tech. Instead, they'll be high concept and high touch. Indeed, Kirwin, the programmer in Delaware, partly confirms my suspicion. After he lost his job at J.P. Morgan, he collected unemployment for three months before he found a new job at a financial services company he prefers not to name. He's now an IT designer, not a programmer. The job is more complex than merely cranking code. He must understand the broader imperatives of the business and relate to a range of people. "It's more of a synthesis of skills," he says, rather than a commodity that can be replicated in India.  Kirwin still believes the job is "offshorable," though I'm less certain. And he's earning less than he did at J.P. Morgan, though the downturn is much to blame for that, as it is for at least part of the broader anxiety that programmers are feeling.   But Kirwin does begin to address Senator Turner's question. Back in New Jersey, she introduced what appeared to be an unanswerable riddle: What comes after knowledge? The answer, perhaps, is an update of the slogan that appears in giant steel-and-neon letters on the Trenton Bridge, just a few miles from Turner's office. That slogan, affixed to the bridge in 1935 to proclaim the region's manufacturing strength, reads TRENTON MAKES - THE WORLD TAKES. Now that the rest of the world is acquiring knowledge, and we're moving to work that is high concept and high touch, where innovation is essential but the path from breakthrough to commodity is swift, the more appropriate slogan - of both admonition and possibility - might be this: AMERICA DISCOVERS. THE WORLD DELIVERS. It's a soggy, breezy Saturday afternoon - and I'm hanging out with Aparna Jairam and her husband, Janish, in their comfortable sixth-floor flat in suburban Mumbai. Janish, who also works in the IT industry, is a genial fellow whose laid-back friendliness nicely complements his wife's quiet intensity. We're drinking tea, eating vadas, and discussing the future. "Someday," Janish says, "another nation will take business from India." Perhaps China or the Philippines, which are already competing for IT work. "When that happens, how will you respond?" I ask. "I think you must have read Who Moved My Cheese?" Aparna says to my surprise.  Janish gets up from the couch, and to my still greater surprise, pulls a copy from the bookshelf.  Who Moved My Cheese? is, of course, one of the best-selling books of the past decade. It's a simpleminded - and, yes, cheesy - parable about the inevitability of change. The book (booklet is more like it - the $20 hardcover is roughly the length of this article) is a fable about two mouselike critters, Hem and Haw, who live in a maze and love cheese. After years of finding their cheese in the same place every day, they arrive one morning to discover that it's gone. Hem, feeling victimized, wants to wait until somebody puts the cheese back. Haw, anxious but realistic, wants to find new cheese. The moral: Be like Haw.  Janish gave Aparna a copy of the book for their wedding anniversary last year. (He inscribed it, "I am one cheese which won't move.") She read it on a Hexaware commuter bus one morning and calls it "superb."  The lesson for Aparna was clear: The good times for Indian IT workers won't last forever. And when those darker days arrive, "We should just keep moving with the times and not be cocooned in our little world. That's the way life is." Or as Haw more chirpily explains to his partner, "Sometimes, Hem, things change and they are never the same. This looks like one of those times. That's life! Life moves on. And so should we." If you're among the pissed off, such advice - especially coming from talking rodents chasing cheddar around a maze - may sound annoying. But it's not entirely wrong. So if Hem and Haw make you hurl, return to where Aparna began when I met her that first day - the sacred text of Hinduism, the Bhagavad Gita, whose 700 verses many Indians know by heart.  The Gita opens with two armies facing each other across a field of battle. One of the warriors is Prince Arjuna, who discovers that his charioteer is the Hindu god Krishna. The book relates the dialog between the god and the warrior - about how to survive and, more important, how to live. One stanza seems apt in this moment of fear and discontent. "Your very nature will drive you to fight," Lord Krishna tells Arjuna. "The only choice is what to fight against."     Source: Daniel H. Pink,wired.com, 02/01/04

       Kiran mazumdar-Shaw, CEO of the Indian biotech firm Biocon, starts her day with a quiet prayer. On an April morning this year, her appeals for grace and good fortune were apparently answered: Biocon's initial public offering was a smashing success. The company's stock opened on the Indian bourse at a price of $7.32 a share—and three days later was trading at $16. That made the Bangalore-based Biocon, a leader in making statins (cholesterol-reducing agents), a billion-dollar company. The IPO also made Mazumdar-Shaw the richest woman in India, with company stock worth $450 million. Sixty percent of the shares were offered to, and quickly snatched up by, foreign institutional investors. "I knew we were doing very well," says Mazumdar-Shaw. "But we're a little surprised by the enthusiasm of investors."   She shouldn't be. Foreign fund managers have been gaga over India for quite some time, actually. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, or CalPERS—the $165 billion U.S. pension fund that puts a premium on corporate-governance practices—decided in April to start investing in Indian companies. Where CalPERS goes, other international investors tend to follow. Last year alone, more than $7.5 billion was pumped in, the highest in any year since the country opened to foreign capital in 1993. According to a United Nations Conference on Trade and Development study, major foreign direct investment is expected over the next few years in the country's industrial sector—automobile manufacturing, machinery, chemicals and, to a lesser extent, electronics.  The bullish attitude can be traced mostly to India's booming economy. GDP growth this year is forecast to reach 7 percent, rivaling China's. "India has really turned a corner and emerged as one of the most attractive investment destinations globally for foreign investors," says Vikas Bali, a principal at the global management-consulting firm A.T. Kearney in New Delhi.  India's economic reforms are far from complete—not every Indian state has gotten religion on the virtues of unfettered capitalism—but the concept has been widely accepted by the country's political and economic elite. New Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is a reformist. His government's first budget will raise social spending, but also raises the foreign-ownership limits in several business sectors. "This is a budget with an eye on the big picture," says Sunil Munjal, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry. "It presents a vision for growth and development."  Although China still attracts far more foreign investment annually, India's governing institutions are much more mature. Besides being the world's largest democracy, the country has a transparent legislature and an independent—if grindingly slow—judiciary. But where India really has an edge over China is its large pool of English-speaking and relatively inexpensive technological manpower. That talent base has helped persuade global industry leaders like General Electric, Microsoft and Intel to set up their own RD facilities on the Subcontinent. "India offers more long-term advantages than any other huge emerging market today," says a Western diplomat in New Delhi. That's a happy thought for prospectors.    Source:Newsweek
