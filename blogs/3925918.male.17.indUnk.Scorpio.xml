Dear reminded me that it was the 1st day of ahEm festival... arrgh!! okok... lets not talk abt it anymore.. anyway... yea.. where was i... erm... so we walked back the other way... and decided to sit on a bench. there we talked a little.. den i sang my medley for my Dearest that i prepared ... haha.. den i gave her some pressie... chub chub and the fruity jelly chocs.. those that me n Dear used to eat and share a common craving for. haha. den she gave me her pressies for me...

Look at the sky Tell me what do you see Just close your eyes And describe it to me The heavens are sparkling With starlight tonight That's what I see Through your eyes  Here in the night I see the sun Here in the dark Our two hearts are one It's out of our hands We can't stop what we have begun And love just took me by surprise Looking through your eyes  Lovin you  Dear ... for many more Years to come...

      Fly away on my Zephyr I feel it more then ever And in this perfect weather We'll find a place together Fly on my wing Riddlin on liberator Find a way to be a skater Rev it up to levitator Super mainly aviator Take a look its on display - for you Coming down no not today Fly away on my Zephyr I feel it more then ever And in this perfect weather We'll find a place together In the water where the scent of my emotion All the world will pass me by Fly away on my Zephyr We'll find a place together  Heys Mr Blog.. haven been writing to you for such a long time... hmmm.. so much have been happening recently.. haiz..  how can i spill my heart out when i don't even know how to face it and deal with my problems.. haiz... well... hope i can handle them.. well when i really cannot take it anymore i still can go jogging ya... hope i'll be able to handle my problems better...  hMmmm.. have been kinda down lately.. made my Dear down too... so so sorry Dear.. haiz... i haven solved the problem yet mr. BLog... i still keep making Dear sad.. very sad.. i feel sad too. i really feel so much even though sometimes its just a small matter. haiz... its cuz my Dear really means so much to me.. everything she does i can feel it so much more strongly... sometimes its good.. but sometimes i channel this energy negatively, thus causing her to be hurt..  really don't wish to let her go, never want to make her sad... she means more than everything to me... she is my life, my best friend, and most importantly, someone i love so much... i can tell her all my problems, all my unhappiness abt anything in life.. i can talk to her about almost any crap under the sun... haha.. really very fun when joking with her.. she can really make me laugh like mad sometimes.. i would just forget everything and it almost seems like i'm lost in time with her, where im so so happy that i can completely forget abt everything else thats around me and just look into her eyes... seeing her laugh... just makes me so happy when i can see her smile, tickle her so much she can't stop laughing and blames me for it...  however the prob is i still make my Dear unhappy at times.. i really will try not expecting so much, asking less, i love you who you really are Darling... i just don't know how to describe my feelings... never ever want to leave you....  I never imagined a dream so clear Until the day that you came in You open my eyes, brightened all of my days You’ve changed my life in so many ways Without you in my life everything's just blue But now that you are at my side I know this one thing's true  I'll never let go of the one who loves me so I'll never let go of the one who believes in me I'll stay by your side until the end of time And I'll never let you, let you go  I never thought that I’d find love just like this So many feelings all wrapped up in a kiss Showing me sunsets in such heavenly skies With your precious smile and one look in your eyes These feelings that I have inside I'll never let them show But now that you are in my life I want the world to know  I'll never let go of the one who loves me so I'll never let go of the one who believes in me I'll stay by your side until the end of time And I'll never let you, let you go  I'll never mistreat you, never cause you any pain I'll always protect you, be your shelter from the rain You don't have to worry, no you don't have to fear Cause I'll be with you right by your side Yes I'll always be near Yes I'll always be near  I'll never let go of the one who loves me so I'll never let go of the one who believes in me I'll stay by your side until the end of time Girl you should know that I love you so much baby And I'll never let you, let you go
