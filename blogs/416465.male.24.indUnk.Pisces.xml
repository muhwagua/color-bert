       Chicago's Best Burger?   So tonight for Easter dinner,  urlLink John  and I (and others) were at a restaurant debating the menu.  "CHICAGO'S BEST BURGER" the menu proclaimed. Well, well, well. We had nothing of that. Best burger? If this is true, tell me:  - How can you put a price tag on the ONE hamburger that is the best in Chicago? If the one I am eating is the best, does that mean the one the guy next to me is eating is not quite as good? Or is it better? I want to know! The name is misleading. It should be the "best hamburger s  in Chicago." Fix it.  - The only way a burger can be deemed "the best" is if it has been eaten. If it's not eaten, then what was it, the best-looking burger? best smelling? And don't tell me they could eat half of the burger and tell. What if the second half is grossly undercooked, or has a large squirming tapeworm in it? Human finger? Didn't anyone else see that episode of Buffy? Therefore you cannot base the quality of an individual burger. The name should now be " Chicago's best burger recipe(or preparation). "  - I live in Minneapolis. How am I eating Chicago's best burger if I'm not in Chicago? This is not Chicago's best burger. It may be the best burger FROM Chicago; and since it's not the burger that is the best, but the recipe, it is in actuality the " Best burger recipe(or preparation) FROM Chicago. "  - But wait! Who is to say it's the best? It is not mathematical, it was voted. Not only was it voted, but it was voted by an uneven representation of demographics! Therefore it is in actuality " Voted the best burger recipe (or preparation) FROM Chicago, as decided subjectively by a panel of individuals, having no basis in fact. Choose for yourself. "  I am all about Political Correctness, and THIS my friends is not PC.

It was hella funny.  SPEAKING of funny things. Does anyone remember that episode of the Simpsons where Homer has that lobster that he raises and he becomes buddies with it and he loves it, but then he ends up eating it? The whole time he's bawling his eyes out saying "oh you taste so good," loving how it tastes... but still crying? That was pretty funny. Ironic too.

      SOMETHING I AM WONDERING ABOUT:  On the bus today there was this couple. Kinda ugly, both of them, nothing to write home about, but they were being very affectionate and I thought it was kinda adorable, but then I realized a few things:  1: It was one-sided. He had his hand on her neck and back, rubbing her, squeezing her and such. Every once in a while she giggled, but I have seen the behavior before, it's something of a "you're mine" pet. The kind you do when you run your fingers through your retriever's hair. It disturbed me.  2: He didn't look at her. Granted, he might suffer neck strain if he did, but the entire time he looked around the bus. I was listening to music and trying to ignore the scene, but I caught him staring right at me out of the corner of my eye a few times. Now what is that? Is that the "See this? She's mine!" stare? Like 1, I have seen this before too. You look around to make sure nobody's looking at your girl. If you see someone looking at your girl, you check to make sure there is no eye contact. She was not looking at anyone, I could tell. She made it a point to look above and between people.  I'm probably paranoid, but the look in his eyes and the behavior I saw I've seen before and I didn't like it one bit. Was I wrong to want to punch him just for my assumptions? o_O

      My complaint for tonight lies solely on the shoulders of the menace that is AVANT GARDE CINEMA!  *crowd boo's and hisses*  First movie we watched tonight was some hillbilly's home movies, including a woman giving birth. They showed it, close up, beginning to end... all the blood and placenta and umbelical cords and everything. And... wow. Yeah. That didn't exactly turn me on.  Now... something else we saw was about a gay man's infatuation with sailors, and the one sailor who stayed behind after the other sailors beat the gay guy up. Then the gay sailor picked up the gay man (who was now naked) and carried him home, and they slept together, and it was so romantic.  The guy who did the second movie's name is Kenneth Anger, and I read a review about him that labeled his films as personal masturbatory material. It makes sense. "Scorpio Rising" is just people straight from the Blue Oyster Bar. Scary. Someone hold me?  Please?

           Concerned Observer:  As Christians know, aureoles (or halos) are fluffy ring-shaped clouds that hover above  the heads of Jesus, Mary, and all the saints. In every day life, the spiritual observer sees halos above the heads of righteous people, and sees devil horns  above the heads of sinners. The secular observer sees no difference.   The Devil cannot stand goodness! To mock the Lord, he has created  counterfeit halos in nuclear explosions, and rubber prophylactics. They are equally destructive.   Atomic warfare has gone out of fashion, so Satan has no choice but to promote condoms.  If they looked satanic, people wouldn't sin and use them. But fornication seems  almost righteous when any Tom, Dick, or Harry can claim that  little halo, if only for a moment.   The Bible clearly states that no Christian would use one!   Praise the Word!

      Dude. I have really not been in the mood for school work, yet school starts back up Monday and I have midterms week. What the hell is that, do you expect people to read and study and do papers over spring break? Granted, I had no reason not to since I didn't go anywhere, but the point is... the fact that I didn't go anywhere made me feel all the more reluctant to do any work, so I haven't and don't want to. Screw them.  I'm going to bed.

      My thoughts of the day:  Maury Povich: Now, it's no secret that Maury likes having little girls on his show whom he can hug and kiss and fondle to his wee heart's content. That's all fine and good, he also has freaks of nature on whom he does the same thing to. a 3' midget burn victim... *shudders* I guess you gotta take the crookeds with the straights if you want to fondle little girls. Anyway.  Yesterday as I wasted another Spring Break day I turned it to Maury, and he had the special "voyeur" show, where different people were videotaped doing "naughty" things. All well and good, right? Yeah, you know where I'm going with this, right? There was a girl of 14 who was videotaped at a mall, changing for a photoshoot... she had been caught naked, and in various states of undress.  How horrible!  Well Maury, the loving host had the girl (like 9 years later) on the show, and on the screen was -- you guessed it -- the video tape of the 14 year old girl in various states of undress! They blurred the topless scenes... but... what the hell is that? o_O  All right, I have more to bitch about, including Ricki Lake and Shipmates, but my white trash TV rant is finished for tonight!

I just have a question, for the female types... what the hell is up with those long long sweaters? They look like dresses, so when you wear pants with them, it just looks... freaky. Ghetto for sure. I'm thinking 80's when I see thick pants under a skirt, because I'm thinking leggings.   I seriously have to throw whatever those sweater things into my burning oil drum along with capri pants and peacoats. Death to all three of them!

       urlLink Libby  asked the question "How do you just... stop... doing something that has become a habit?" and that reminds me of something I've been wondering for quite a while...  I've always prided myself on self-diagnosis; on being able to fix whatever it is that is wrong with me, but that just isn't so recently. As I grow older, I grow more wary. It is to the point where I cannot even believe myself. So how the hell do I trick myself? I can't outsmart myself to unlearn a behavior, or learn a new one. I'm wise to my own tricks, and thus am stuck how I am with no chance of conscious change.  There is such a fine line between being normal and being too smart for your own good. Balancing on that line is the ability to do anything you want, mentally... the ability to teach the old dog new tricks. But for me, that ability is gone. Perhaps this dog is too old to learn new tricks, and where I was when I stumbled across that line is where I'm left to sit for the rest of my life.  Holy crap, I'm beginning to see how it's so easy to get melodramatic on a blogger. You don't mean to, but it just starts coming out as "woe is me," and again, here I am sounding like a head case. woo?

      I'll tell you what is fun: Looking at a stripper so she comes towards you, thinking you will give her money, then you look away and ignore her. She is hurt, dejected; not because of the feigned attention, but because she was not paid.  Why is that fun? Because all a strip club is is girls who pretend like you're something special with the sole intent of taking your money. You give them the money, they perform prostitutesque moves on you when nobody is looking, get up, take your cash, and leave you wanting more. This is what causes men to pay even more money for the crack-addicted trashy cousin of the stripper: the prostitute. Not only does the prostitute want your money, she also wants to give YOU a nice little gift in return in the form of an STD.  "But that's not fair!" She exclaims as she hits you over the head with the motel bible. She calls her pimp to come up and cut out your kidney, and they steal your wallet, leaving you in a bath tub full of ice cubes which have numbed your genitals so you can't yet sense the package the whore left you.  And I'm talkin DOWNTOWN!  And that, friends, is why you should never let your friends borrow your solid-fill love doll.

       New Heat Update!   I was told earlier this evening that the heat was probably well over 100 degrees in here, possibly upwards of 200 degrees. I doubt it was 200, since you know, I'd be dead and all, but it was maybe around 150. The thermostat hit 300 but the furnace couldn't quite hit that I don't think. Either way... wow, I'm alive.  Now shut up.  I need a drink!

       Immense Heat Update:   Last night, well, this morning when I lay down to sleep, my bed was hot. Unseasonably warm, and it felt like it was plugged in. Everything in this house is hot to the touch. What the shit is this?  I woke up way, way too early this morning, because it's too hot to sleep, and it's so COLD outside, and nothing can be done about it. Wah.   urlLink John  left and slept elsewhere, while I was stuck in this icky icky hot place, with only a fan... a fan in front of the radiator... blowing hot air... what the damn?  So now I embark on a journey of actually doing school work, if I can. We shall see. Highly doubt it, but I shall try!  I just remembered a dream I had last night... it was a mix of Black Knight (the Martin Lawrence "movie"), Scorpion King (mainly, just the commercial, where he's using the bow and arrow), and my own sick and twisted mind creating a magical world where a magical arrow can bring you back to life... or something gay like that. o_O  That is why unnatural heat is a bitch: It makes Bean crazy.

      WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Hi kids!  Today's words to be thrown in the trash are Loyalty and Sincerity. If anybody knows somebody who actually could use one of these words, let them know so maybe they can come get them from the trash can; but don't mind the banana peels.  So right now, the temperature outside is maybe 40 degrees if that, and the temperature inside is probably 96. The thermostat is fucked, so I'm either going to freeze or melt. WOOOOOOOOnderful.  In other news, I put horizontal lines on the right, but that's about it for site updates. I'm sorry, I wanted to post something, and I can't think of anything funny today! :(

And sports. I don't have as many excuses to sit on my ass 24 hours a day online.  When I mentioned Summer clothes, I started hearing "Paint it Black" in my mind. And now I'm creeped out. That song is twisted as hell.  I guess that's why it's the theme song for Twisted Metal Black? [/ramble]  Oh yeah, and yesterday was my first day back to school after a 5-day weekend.

      So I didn't go to class yesterday due to a migraine. I couldn't think straight and was in a shitload of pain when I went to bed so I emailed my teachers and put them in the outbox to be sent in the morning. When I got up to send them, I checked and saw they were already sent and replied to!  Well, the one wasn't replied to until later when the teacher told me he hopes my hangover gets better. I laughed at that, then thought to myself... DAMN IT! I wasn't drinking, and even if I was, I don't get hangovers, so that's just wrong. Perhaps I should reply to his e-mail and set him straight. o_O  Yes, yes you're right. It's been three days since I've posted and I needed something to mention and I couldn't think of anything.  Well, me and  urlLink John  played basketball today cause it's nice out. That was my day.  How was yours? :|

      So instead of doing homework all day, I've been playing Madden, going out to lunch with my brothers and then a thought came to me while I was in the library, doing a crossword puzzle: What kind of crossworder are you? Do you like to wait until you've got them all figured out before filling them in, or do you like to write over, or erase anything you have wrong? Me, I go as far as I can without editing and if I get one wrong and I get stuck, I quit. I rule like that.   Anyway, all night I've been trying to find a crossword puzzle maker, and FINALLY I found one and it rules bigtime. So, I've made a crossword puzzle about things found on my site. All five of my readers, let's see how well you do:  urlLink click here  to do my crossword.

      In the last half hour of the day I thought I would give you all a thrilling recap of my Friday, April 5th, nineteen ninety twelve.  Around midnight, I passed out from being sick and exhausted from a harrrd week of, well, classes. Okay so it wasn't hard, but it still tired me out cause I'm sick.  I get up at quarter to eight and hop on here for a while, then go downstairs for some banana bread and to finish my game of Madden.  Then, it's off to my brother's for a long day of driving in his peacup, and napping while he ran in places. Then I bought a DVD; then we made more stops (one to the liquor store) and eventually came home. Left around noon and came back around six.   So, he bought his DirecTV and it got set up. Played some Virtua Fighter 2 with him (and drank) and Pokemon Stadium 2 with his daughter, and then we watched about 600 channels of tv (whilst drinking). After the kids went to bed, Skinemax came on and we watched some Emmanuelle something or other, a softcore porn about a hot blonde with mind control devices and pierced nipples. I give it four stars.  Then I came home. And now I want to pass out again. I'm tired.  First, I gotta go pick on a certain drunk girl some more... ;)

      What's my problem?  I sit on my ass for half a semester and then midterms come around, I'm stressed out (for reasons other than midterms) in fact, I can't even study for midterms... but I take them, expect to get a C or worse, and end up getting 102%. That's kool.   Another Tale From the Bus   I love Minnesota Metro Transit. The bus drivers must all be subjected to psychological tests, because after driving around in the worst traffic ever, in the bitter cold, they're still good people.  I often hear about places not having any busing at all, much less a high-quality system like here.  My question to you:  What's the public transportation like there? o_O

Does anybody find this look hip or attractive in the least? I think it's horrible, but maybe I'm missing something. Kixx, what's your opinion?

       I just realized something.   I'm all alone.  I looked out my window tonight on the way home and saw a sorority house: "Technical Women Students."  Why don't I get that? Every minority gets their own group, their own club, somewhere to fit in. The only group for fat people and heavy drinkers end in "Anonymous," and the sole purpose is to STRIP YOU of those traits. Society just wants me to be a normal, boring, young adult middle class white male with no known distinguishing characteristics.  I'm not a frat boy. I'm not stupid and slutty or average looking enough. Plus, I hate beer, and I suck at frisbee. My parents aren't rich, and I don't like the concept of pledging. I don't embarass myself for acceptance. I just sit on my ass and ask for it while doing nothing.  I'm an English major. What do I do? I could be in an artsy book club, but I don't read. I'm not a pseudo-intellectual I'm an actual fucking intellectual. I'm smart but only as smart as I am. I do not act any smarter. I do not use lots of big words and I don't quote people. I do not fit in with my own group. I have no group. As "up myself" as I am, I'm nowhere near where I should be and that is sad.  I need some horn rimmed glasses and a black turtle neck and start writing poetry because this whole "being unique" bullshit is not all it's cracked up to be.

       Slackers   Wow. This movie rocked. John will agree with me when I say...this movie rocked.  In a sea of unoriginal comedy, this little fishy had many complex characters, and by complex I mean really fucked up and unpredictable and Laura Prepon rules. Usually I like it when the straight man is as zany as the comic relief, and this was no different... Devon Sawa... eh. Allow me to be shallow here: He needs braces. In a world that ridicules Jewel to no end about her teeth, Devon Sawa needs some fucking braces.  Anyway, Slackers almost made me hate it with the evilness of Jason Schwartzmann, but still... certain parts of the film were funny. I won't ruin the jokes, because joke ruiners are stupid.  But I will ruin this commercial I've seen, don't know if any of yall have seen it:  These two kids are standing in a field on a farm, they are saying something about the Burger King Big Kids meal, when they ponder "how will we get there?" at which point they turn to the family horse and they have an epiphany.  The next scene shows the two kids sitting in the cab of a pickup truck, with the horse behind the wheel, driving. I don't know if this commercial is intentionally hilarious, but I cracked up watching it, and John laughed just hearing aboot it. Funny.  Also: In my recent brainwashing at the hands of MTV 2 I have fallen in love with Norah Jones. Is that wrong? I know that MTV 2 are just MTV in disguise... but I can't help it. I'm a sucker for a pretty voice. And so impressionable...

      BATS!@!@#@%@$^%&*U%^%$$#@  All right so my house is special, yall. You know how lots of houses have little doggie doors? Well not so much because of skinny burglars, but in the movies all houses have doggie doors. Anyway, my house has a special bat door. Every summer is bat season; every winter, mouse season. Like clockwork, there's another bat in my basement. There will be about five in all this year, as in every other year. They are pretty good about staying in the basement, but sometimes they don't.  DATELINE CIRCA 1985 CE, my brothers and I are playing on the hide-a-bed in the den (I think), when a great big black thing comes up from the basement. I, being the brave little five-year-old I am, dive under the hide-a-bed and, well, hide. This was my earliest bat memory.  DATELINE LIKE A FEW YEARS AGO, I was washing my face down in the basement, as there is no working sink above the basement, when I see something moving in the washer to my left. My glasses were off so it was just black and furry and moving, so I slammed the cover, assuming it was a bat or something bat-like. Lo and behold, one cold-rinse cycle later, the shivering, unconscious bat was removed from the washer and released into the wild, alive. Good stuff.  DATELINE I FORGOT, MAYBE TWO YEARS BEFORE THE LAST ONE, I was sitting on my computer chit chatting with people when a bat came up. Me, being the brave upper-teen teenager I was, hit the deck and came upstairs, signing online up here. I am sure some of the people I knew back then may recall this. It was quite funny, oh it was indeed.   Later on, as I gathered the courage, I hunted this damned bat. It was no floozie bat, it did not go home the next morning. I grabbed my AWESOME blow gun and shot its wing with a blow dart. Eventually it flew away so I can't prove that I have good aim, but I thought I got him (sorry Kelly). I am pretty sure he/she/it was ok though. However, I got a blow dart stuck in my ceiling. Kinda sucked. Got it out though, but I believe Josh and/or Sam broke the mouthpiece of the gun as it was on my floor, since I am a messy bastard. Anywho, I can't shoot anymore bats, b'gorrah, and I was fin ta, too, to have lunch for tomorrow....  TTFN.

      Vanilla Sky  So I saw this movie tonight. I didn't really want to see it, as I have honed the ability to tell a shitty movie from its commercials, and this movie had some of the worst. It's a damned shame that the advertising was so horrible, because I really really liked it.  Now, I'm still as skeptical as ever, and fully realized this was just another head trip of a movie witholding vital information in an attempt to throw you off making you think you've been fooled, but the ways Vanilla Sky worked were very new and, erm, for lack of a better term, kicked ass.  One reviewer for the film had said there were too many twists and turns, so many that they lost their effectiveness. Listening to him I thought "Wow! That really sucks!" After seeing it, however, I cannot believe how thoroughly he missed the point. For those keeping score, he was some Minneapolis News reviewer, I think. Anyway, one thing I noticed about Vanilla Sky was that every time something happened that I wanted to talk about, I had no chance to say so. The plot just moved too quickly. I couldn't avert my eyes for a second without missing something -- and not everything missed was all that important, either. That doesn't matter; what matters is that I was on my heels for most of the movie and wasn't given time to fully think about what was happening.  To my credit, though, I almost figured it out. As I said, certain things were omitted to make you feel like you weren't smart enough to get it. To avoid spoiling the movie, I will avoid spoiling the movie, but anyway...  Part two of this funky rhyme, G(Something of a spoiler, indeed):  I caught the eeriest feeling when Aames finally found Sophia, up until he woke up the next morning. What feeling? Well, the feeling that I could relate to his life as it existed at that moment. The way she treated him, his reaction... it was soopa powerful for me because I know what that feels like.  All right, now, to lighten the mood (for me, not for you, asshead), here's a dancing skeleton:

      Two un-touched-upon points:  1: A cowboy movie with Kelso from That 70's Show, Usher and Dawson from Dawson's Creek? OH MY GOD that's going to kill Spiderman at the box office! o_O Seriously though... just... what the hell? My brain just exploded all over the friggin place. That's the worst trio of stars any movie could ever fathom! Argh! And not even Rachael Leigh Cook can save it, unless she gets all nekkid... and shows up in my room... but you know the chances of that happening are like, 2:1.  2: So now MTV is going to be sued for some fucking IDIOT teenager who set himself on fire in his back yard as his parents were busy ignoring him, and making sure he couldn't read the disclaimer about not doing stuff they do on "Jackass" at home. I personally saw the episode where they set themselves on fire, and the instructor was pretty explicit that you can easily die if you do it... so could this boy not comprehend English? Was he watching and saying "fiiiiiiiire coooooooool?" If you're stupid enough to ignore the warnings, and you know, have a COMPLETE wont of common sense, you have larger problems than media influence, you've gotta see a shrink, and a tutor, and possibly Kevorkian, because if you're over five years old and you can't figure out that it's bad to set yourself on fire, there is little to no hope for you.   Just let those kinds of people out on their own; a speeding bus will eventually end their suffering when they wander into traffic.

       The Origins of AlphaBean: Part 1  (It's in reverse order, remember?)  Q: "Why do you prefer Bean over Scott?"  A: It's a many-faceted explanation, which is undoubtedly too complex for your simple minds. Just kidding. First of all, I like it as a nickname. It suits me, it's silly... and it's not "Scottie." I hate hate hate being called "Scottie" and you may ask 'well then why did you go by Scottie when you first came around?' and I will answer you that it was the only thing I could come up with that in the tiniest bit described who I was. I have found the moniker to do so in AlphaBean.  Also, in the past year, I have grown ashamed of the name Scott. It has come to signify things I can't comprehend and that disgust me. If I do not see myself as Scott, I cannot fall into that same hole. At least I fucking hope that's true ;)  I have another reason, one more personal... but I'm not going to be a Drama Bean here and type it out. All you need to know is that I prefer to be called Bean than Scott. At least online. For some reason, having anyone call me one thing after calling me another for as long as they've known me, just doesn't sit well. I'm not a big fan of change.  That is all.

       What's an AlphaBean?   Okay so Dana (link to the right) questioned a couple of things tonight: 1) Why do I prefer being called Bean over Scott, and 2) What the fuck is an AlphaBean?  Well let's go in reverse order:  32 years ago on the streets of Manila, there lived a little pauper boy named Scott. That was me. Except it wasn't Manila, it was Minnesota. And it wasn't the street... it was my couch. And it wasn't 32 years ago... it was, like, three. Oh, and I was never a pauper. I am a PRINCE. You hear me? PRINCE!!!!  Anyway, I had just bought a laptop (which has long since been destroyed), and also bought the game Worms 2. I was the daddy at that game, and my squad, whose names I've forgotten, were led by one Alpha Bean. Basically, he was the leader, and his name was Bean. He fucking ruled. He was usually the only worm I had left on the more tricky, difficult levels. ANYWAY.  I had been known on the internet as Scottie, ScottieW, ScoTTieX, and then Spifferz. Spifferz was so gay, but I was told it was close enough to ScoTTieX that it was ok. Well I made a drastic change and adopted the name of my favorite worm, AlphaBean. Now, I am world-famous and so is my name. In fact, even javascript fuckers have stolen my name to use on their code. That is irrelevant. Basically, I'm now me, and you all have been graced by my glorious humility and character.  I'm so special that I think I'll wait until tomorrow for part 1, so that this doesn't end up being too long of a post.

      Knee Brace!  I've found what I've been missing all these years. I have been in dire need of a knee brace. Later on I think I'll post the story about my broken leg and the ensuing problems, but right now I'll just say that when I was 11 my femur was broken, and ever since I've had a pretty weak quad and the way I walked from it resulted in a permanent, I don't know what it's called, but my feet are bent inward and my kneecaps go outward and it's a bitch, and is resulting in arthritic symptoms.  Anyway, I got the brace, and I can actually run, and bend my knee, and it doesn't hurt, and my leg goes straight up. It's funny that for some reason I hadn't gotten one before... you know, in 11 years. o_O  So this isn't an entertaining post or funny or anything... I'm sorry. I think all my funny evaporated with the alcohol from last night. I still haven't told yall about that yet, and I won't... yet. Not tonight.  Also, Samantha's site is almost done. I just have to get bored enough to open Dreamweaver up on my P2 333 with 64 megs ram again. :P  OH MY GOD I have chronic boringness today. I'm gonna stop the bleeding and end this post quickly.

For the uninformed, Heather = blonde, usually falsely tanned, "like, omigod" young woman, of which there are thirty BILLION in Minnesota.  They're generally pretty cute, though with makeup and tanning, you can never be sure if you're really just attracted to a robot in disguise. Or, you know... an exact replica of yourself.  SO. I've heard quite a few great stories tonight. I'm way too drunk to tell them right now, so I will wait until tomorrow or such.  I'm really ashamed that I don't go drinking more.  Anyway... On a scale of 1-10 I just told a friend I was about 7.5 which is pretty damned drunk, so I'm going to go pass out, since my work here... is done. What work, you ask?  DIE.

      Woo.  I still have lots of polishing to do, but at least now my blog is being advertised and the redesign is done, so I can rest easily. I believe I am supposed to take the opportunity to make a shout out to blogsnob... not like they need to be advertised, but... o_O  Oh, and I'm not gay if you were wondering. :)  I've posted two measly excerpts from conversations on the Convos section, still waiting for people to start putting stuff up. I've invited BurnZy so hopefully he will get it going sufficiently.  Future projects for me include making a section for Sammi Jo, who is Josh's big sister, so you can see some pictures of her on Josh's page. I'm also going to work on my family tree, and I'll be uploading it -- I dunno if I'm going to make it public though. I suppose it's for the best so I know if I'm related to any of you before you try scoring with me. o_O   That was a joke.

      All right so I gave in.  I am so desperate for attention and for my little counter to go up, that I'm joining webrings. What this means is I want people visiting, and I want people clicking that little "comment" link under my posts. Do you hear me?  As I've said to Joanna (no link for her, but she comments from time to time), we should begin a life of crime. This whole nothing-to-blog existence is getting to me, it really is. What can I say? I don't do much. It's summer now, and work is such a bitch that I am easily spent, so I sit around playing videogames.  So hi kids, I rented NBA2k2 last week and played it. I'm not very good. I don't really play enough video games anymore, because there aren't any good multiplayer games outside of sports.  I'm thinking about adding a TV rant section to my site so I can discuss what happened on the few shows I watch: WWE Wrestling, Smallville, Dark Angel(rip) and all the trashy hookups shows like Elimidate, and Shipmates. Everyone needs a forum to discuss Elimidate!  And now, as people are checking out my site for reviews and such, they see just what a pathetic loser I am, and I will forever be labeled as such. :(  So this is a long rant, perhaps I should work on my template and shrink the font some more so it looks like I didn't type so much.  I wish I could post more funny shit on here, but I think for that I need to start drinking more religiously. I haven't been to a liquor store in a few weeks, so I have nothing to aide me to that end. So until that day...  Battle on, Xena! [thumbs up]

      You know what sucks ass?  Asian chicks don't dig the big guys. That's a damn shame, because I like the Asian chicks.    You know what else sucks? Drinking so much you embarass yourself, but you don't drink enough that you can't remember embarassing yourself. God damn it, I'd prefer to wake up tied to a tree with my head shaved and my pants around my ankles and not know what the hell happened, than to wake up the next morning and be ashamed.  On the plus side... once again, no hangover. I'm such a hangoverless pimp.  On the negative side... I was mumbling incoherently in my sleep, and since I had passed out in John's chair, he got to hear it all and laugh at me.  In my defense: I brought a bottle of Cuervo Margarita to the party to share, but nobody would share, so I just kept taking cups of it until it was gone. Also, I hadn't been to sleep because of final papers. So, there I was falling asleep in the computer lab at school waiting for a ride to go to the party, then I get there and get shitfaced. O_o And when I drink, I can't sleep... so that just sucked.  And needless to say, I asked a guy at the party to drop me off somewhere along a certain street but forgot to tell him where on the street. So I was drunk, lost, but somehow made it to the bus stop. I rule! o_O  OK no I don't.  God, I keep getting flashbacks.

Dark Angel is directed by James Cameron tonight, 90 minutes of greatness co-starring Lita from the WWF.

       Mr Deeds   FUCK THAT. Not worth a Beanie Review. It was a remake, but all they did was threw some jokes on top of it instead of actually doing anything. It seemed more like a home video of Sandler and his friends than an actual movie. I wasted a lot of money on the movie and I WANT IT BACK. :(   Lilo and Stitch   I loved this movie. It was actually funnier than 'Deeds' because it used wit and intelligence instead of "HOLY SHIT THAT'S WICKED FUCKED UP MAN" humor. It was intelligent and pretty mature, with more cohesion despite the twist-ful finish than 'Deeds."   I totally love the mischievous little alien and see myself slightly in that role, except I'm big, human, not a cartoon, and not infinitely intelligent.  Anyway, the best part of the film was when Stitch uses his powers to be constructive at the request of Lilo. I'm not spoiling anything, but look out for it, and you'll see what I mean.  I went to see the movie in Thunder Bay at some big theater with huge screens, and it was all kids (not many though), and John and I laughed our asses off when the kids didn't and it was awkward.   I want you all to watch three movies: Lilo and Stitch, The Bourne Identity, and The Shipping News. Yup.

      And now I'm back... from outer space... you just walked in to....etc...  All right well I just returned from Canada and upper Minnesota on vacation, and I had written out a list of interesting things I noticed about Canada, but I don't know where the list is right now so I will post that later. I just want to say hi, and talk about casinos.  We stopped at two casinos, one to and one from our destination. Both times I couldn't help but get depressed, as though I was in a hospital surrounded by unhappy, sick and dying people. I couldn't even handle it without alcohol, which is why I got quite depressed sober the second time around.  First of all there are the slots. This is where Social Security checks are wasted. In Canada, the elderly Americans take buses to buy their prescriptions cheaper, and on the way back they sit at the slots for HOURS and HOURS just throwing their money away. Outside of the occasional new 18 year old hanging out with friends, I haven't seen one person smile at the slots. NOT EVEN THE WINNERS! Jackpots are won, hundreds and hundreds of dollars... yet these people just stare X_X it's depressing. These people need friends worse than I do.  That leads me to my next casino area: The tables. This is where the most serious of the serious stay. Blackjack is what got people killed in the Old West, and if concealed weapons were legal today I am sure there would be many gambling-related deaths. If you take a hit when you're not supposed to or stand on a low number you gain a handful of enemies for life, because it's not just a game. The heads of the casino march in and out of the table room with armed guards watching over your every move. You can't talk or you might distract somebody. Your actions must be crisp and mathematical and you must obey strict rules. It's a game!   Holy Jesus I think I took my last trip to the casino yesterday. I don't usually care about what other people do with their lives, but I have to make an exception here. Casinos are exploitative trash and I'm not setting foot in another one again.   GRR! Anyway... hiya!

       The Shipping News   I loved this movie. I think maybe I was tricked by the quirkiness of it all... of all the characters and all the situations... Judi Dench did things I'd never expect from someone who was knighted... and many times I looked at the screen thinking... "what the fuck?"  I've been a big big huge fan of Julianne Moore as long as I can remember. She's just ungodly beautiful even at 40+ and she's a better actress than most of the trash out there (Julia Roberts). I've been a huge fan of Kevin Spacey since Outbreak, but lately I've gotten tired of him. Especially K-Pax. That was the worst movie ever. However, in Shipping News, he's solid. Granted, he was overshadowed by his supporting cast, but not buy much. The character he portrayed was complex enough that just saying he was this way or that way wouldn't suffice... so he did well.  Again... wonderful supporting cast. This movie felt very real and if it wasn't for Moore's statuesque larger-than-life beauty, I would never have thought about it being a movie.   The Shipping News was a bit slow to start, and it never really speeds up too much, but it plays like a home movie you don't want to rush, if you can put your mind in the right place. If you're looking for profundity or mindless action look elsewhere. The shame with The Shipping News is, while it's not an action movie, I am sure it would have been so much better in the theater. The 55" TV and surround sound stereo just couldn't capture it like a theater would.  You know, I went to see The Royal Tenenbaums last week and never reviewed it... I suppose I will eventually.  Also... I know I review videos and I think "The Bourne Identity" was the only new release I actually have discussed... but then I'm not all that into seeing new movies, or videos for that matter. My family rents maybe five videos a week and I only watch at most one of them. So... whatever. It's something to post when you have nothing else to post.  I do have a question, though... I have been trying to figure out a system to post stories and allow people to critique them online... does anyone have any suggestions on how to do that?

      All right so I watch a lot of TV and a lot of movies, and I see people with whom, personality-wise, I can relate. They mean well, but they put foot in mouth often, have major flaws, but in the end, while this gets them in trouble... they always end up all right, no harm done.   In the real world, I see everyone trying to be cooler than everybody else. People don't want to say what they're thinking, or say what they feel, they don't want to deal with the consequences, and they don't want to "take any risks." Tactless people with heart-on-sleeve are often looked down upon, usually because the majority of them are viewed to be substance abusers of some sort, or clinically insane.   Anyway...   I'm noticing more and more that I can deal with glaring lapses of personality, and even with stupidity to a point, and generally only dislike people for what they do -- not who they are. I have grown accustomed to tuning out tactless comments, and can converse quite well with some of the more serious cases.   Still, though... I think life needs to more imitate art... to accomodate the intellectually clumsy instead of forcing more and more people to conform and close off. I'm a fuckup but I'm not a bad person, at least I don't think I am, and I'd really like to have a place in this world. Do I need to start a support group for fuckups?   As some of you know, one of the things I believe in is laying the cards on the table... to let people see inside without having to dig, beg, or guess. What I say is what comes to mind at that exact moment. Sometimes I mean it, sometimes I don't... it gets me in trouble often, but how I am in real life is the exact opposite: I say nothing for fear of how it will affect me. With close friends and family I will say what I want to say and sometimes that gets me in huge big trouble as it does on here or anywhere else... but if I didn't speak my mind, I wouldn't speak at all. I just try convincing myself that some of the good I say makes up for some of the bad I say. I want to see some more people talk out their ass so I wouldn't have to feel so alone.

      Two review-type thingies.   The Bourne Identity : Matt Damon an action star? It's true. He pulled it off as well as anyone else could, and gave the character the right amount of, what, innocence? I don't know if I could like him in many action movies -- especially since I am not a big Damon fan, but I loved this movie. It was not overacted or CGI-laden, just a good solid action movie with a bit of thinking involved.  Now, I will have to see TBI again since midway through the film I was afflicted with too-much-mello-yello syndrome and I will spare the gory details, just rest assured the film seemed to run another four hours. Jurassic Park II was forever ruined for me for that reason, though it was a shitty movie to start with, but I still enjoyed TBI as much as possible.   HOWEVER! When the movie was over I was like "FINALLY!" but the line... well it didn't move. It took another 10 minutes to get out of the theater, and when I got out of the theater I took advantage of my size and maneuverability, and made a mad dash through all the small women. I felt kinda bad... but then, I also didn't care. It happens.  OBSERVATION: That movie had lots of old people, most on dates, but quite a few on their own. I was surprised... but then I also noticed there were many young kids there; leaving the theater I heard a group of Jr. High age girls saying "But... what happened here, and who was that?" and I had a chuckle.      Blackhawk Down : Wasn't such a bad movie, but interestingly enough that movie has made me think more than any other movie I've seen this year. Seriously... there were maybe 40 characters, all with bald heads and white whom you had to keep track of, so John and his girlfriend asked quite a bit "who is that?" or something similar... and I had the same problem at times.  ANYWAY. Pretty long, and the "funny" things seemed a bit out of place. I always feel pretty shitty after seeing a "based on true story" movies because I question the validity of certain "holes in the plot" or other such things. Such as... at the end,  the people who were fighting the entire time were forced to run alongside the convoy, while the fresh military men were sitting in there saying "sorry no room!"? Did that really happen? That one guy was wounded and he had to run all the way out of town.  I mean really. I think... that's SHITTY if it's true, and if it's not... then what was the point?  When they show all the casings hitting the ground towards the end... what was the point in that? Nothing, really. Things like that scream "RUSHED" to me.  Also a few minor gripes about Josh Hartnett: He looks 17 in this film. His voice is cracking so much you'd think he just started puberty. He's leading them, yet he is taking orders from everyone else. He's looking to others for advice. He is weak and useless until the end. Most of the movie is him preaching. This movie did too much verbal preaching. I think certain moments where the sound stopped and the camera went to slo-mo you can see the point of the film.... but they kept on preaching. That was not necessary. Oh my god this mosquito bite is killing me.     Other things to say: Okay I already mentioned the mosquito bite so that's out of the way...  Sobe Nirvana is good stuff.  I like songs by Sheila Nicholls.  There is nothing cooler than seeing a girl's thong through her skirt.  HOWEVER, there is nothing that ruins that moment worse than seeing her dad staring at the same thing you are. That's creepy and now it's no longer a fantasy, it's a sad/funny anecdote. Bah.  I'm sad. Someone clean my mind of icky thoughts and replace them with nice dirty thoughts!

      Okay I have a dilemma. Okay it's a... trilemma.  I'm trying to figure out which nickname for Libby I like best.  In my old archives I saw that I called her spongehead, so  1) Spongehead.  2) Rainbow Brite  3) Leebee  Those are the names I've given her. There are other possibilities but since I've given her these three nicknames I want to know which of the three suits her best. While her "name" is Leebee, she is a spongehead, and it's bright red like Rainbow Brite, so the answer could easily be any of the three, really.  Your thoughts?

What I Would Do For Fun If I Was Filthy Rich   All right, first off what good is being rich without war games with your buddies... right? So I will buy dune buggies (or ATV's) for me and all my peeps for a nice all-terrain game of paintball (or laser tag... or something).   I would also buy my own small town next to my Emu ranch, and have an annual "running of the emu" in my small town. You're all invited.  Also, I would buy everything on  urlLink Gadget Masters  and  urlLink Gadget Central  etc. WoOoooOoOOo.  Hmm...   I think I would also buy my block and create an elaborate mansion underneath all the humble little houses. That'd be kewl. People would be like   "Where's Bean's house?"   "Right there"  "You mean that tan/brown one?"  "Um... I guess... and the white/blue one... and like, the rest of the block."  "No no no that's more than one house."  "No... it's not"  Oh yeah. *dx*

      Like all of my big posts, this is extremely unpolished and probably makes no sense at all at times, but it's something that's been on my mind I want to talk about.  All right now I know this is old hat for most people... to think yeah yeah the media controls the nation... but when you think about it, WE only think about how the media controls us in a major way, such as leftist propoganda, gender roles, etc.  More and more lately I've been seeing what media is doing on a micro level -- as in, not just advertising products, but altering society to center around a certain product.  What I have in mind in this case is rap music. I mean beer is beer; alcohol is alcohol and if you're going to get drunk, get drunk. But in the 1980s not only were impressional urban youths being told to consume something, they were being told that if they didn't, they did not belong.   I was talking to residue last night about this (well, something marginally different, but we touched on this) that certain things are considered "black" or "white" or "asian" or "latino;" eg. hot sauce. I mentioned liking it and he said "I thought that was a black thing!" and I said "Oh, I just thought it was a fat thing..."  Now that's just a tangent and not my point particularly, the point being that certain things are social "things," BUT WHY? How the hell is there a universal beverage for your race, or hat for your social circle?  Why do people look at Zima and say "homo drink!" or Malt Liquor and say "AHAHA black drink!"?  More importantly... why do all college students drink beer?  Was it as common before Animal House? Yeeeah probably, but I do know that Animal House was the start of people thinking they HAD to do certain things in college: Join frat, drink lots of beer, dress in togas, and be promiscuous. It was no longer what benefitted you the most or was the most fun, it was the universal code.  "Back then you didn't smoke weed because it was the thing to do, you smoked it because it got you high"  --Willie Nelson in "Half Baked."  Then the late 80s and early 90's roll around and rap stars talk about walking around with a joint or a blunt hanging out of their mouth. No longer was it a pasttime, it was a lifestyle. I go drinking on the weekends because I would prefer to handle the week sober, is that so wrong?  Even in the black and white era of movies, there were two constants: 1, when you came home from a hard day's work, you poured yourself a glass of a nondescript alcohol, or, later, had yourself a beer. You know what I like to do after a hard day's work? Shower, drink something that quenches my thirst, and relax. What does alcohol do? It forces you to relax. If you are not relaxed after working hard, then maybe you should go do something else, because you're not exhausted and there's no reason to "wind down." :wtf:  The other constant is cigarettes: When you're a guy and you smoke, you're cool. You're hip. You're aloof. When you're a woman and you smoke you're seductive, exotic and mysterious. Why is that? Because you have bad breath? Brown teeth? You wheeze like a pig? Your car stinks and has a bunch of burn holes on the driver's seat, and when your convertible is opened up the ashes fly out and get in people's eyes?   I know you're probably thinking "Yeah yeah Bean, we know that already," but I was just giving the two classic examples of how the media forms a lifestyle.  Perhaps later on I'll post something about gender roles (I've learned that there's a whole lot more to it than people think.), and perhaps later another topic.

I just realized that dana and Mike both call me Scott and I haven't known them for TOO long, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I suppose there has to be a certain level of trust and/or friendship to be called by my real name, as though I knew them in real life.  On a less serious note, I need to spruce up the page so I don't have to beg for people to visit and/or reply. I need some sort of weekly section or something. Short fiction?

       Undercover Brother   Saw it tonight... was a funny film. Three movie reviews in one week. I don't think I watched three movies over the last year and here I have three in one week. So anyway, I'd have to watch it again and pay attention to detail if I was to give it an Ebertine dissection, but basically it was damn funny, especially since Dave Chapelle is GOD. Half Baked = best movie ever. Anyway... I did think maybe he was overplayed, but... that's not even a bad thing, since he was the funniest person in the movie. And Doogie Hauser...  Tomorrow is pit day. A day in the searing heat bent over picking up rocks for hours and hours... doesn't it sound sexy? OH YEAH YOU KNOW IT!  So I got my grades back... A A- B+ EH For having three classes only they sucked, but for my first semester back after 10 months it... eh... not so bad. These were upper division courses (cept for the fiction writing I got an A in) so I'm pretty proud. Um... yeah. That's about it.  Nobody's replying to my blog anymore. I'm starting to get all sad. :( see? That's me frowning. Heartless people.

       As the Buzz Fades...   So now... I'm left bored. My two major haunts, Haligh and Libby have stopped posting because of a pair of losers who need to be thrown down the UP escalator at their local mall, and because of this... I am just uninspired for blogging.  People ask, "Bean, why haven't you updated?" and it's not like I can give them the same reason. Nobody likes me enough to stalk me... if a girl stalked me, I would appreciate it, and probably freak her out because I'm so clingy. I'd be like "Awwww you weren't outside my window today... where were you?!?! DID YOU FIND ANOTHER GUY TO STALK? DO YOU HATE ME NOW?" And she'd file a restraining order. Because I am that cool.  You know what I need? A nice cool 8-) smilie from AIM. I'm addicted to it lately. Cool smilie all over the place. 8-) (H) :cool: depending on where I talk to you, you name it, I have finally learned how to type it on a keyboard so that's what I am. KOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.  My days... well my days are getting shorter. My nights... longer. I'm having less and less to blog about as the Summer wanes, but fear not loyal (or slutty) readers, I plan on beginning a crime spree right before school starts... and then they can't catch me, as I'll be blending in to the campus crowd!  Now... it has come to my attention that Libby thinks her sole purpose for existing is NOT to entertain me, yet I am trying to figure out a way to convince her otherwise... any suggestions?  I HAVE DECIDED that since nobody will submit to  urlLink Open Mic Night , that I need a new gimmick... a new method of getting people to give a shit... so I got an idea... let me know what you think:  Lately I've been finding myself more and more hard-pressed to recall things from my childhood, and this FREAKS ME OUT man. Distressing as hell. I have decided that if I start writing out memories from my childhood, not only will I remember more, but I'll have them recorded for when I get older and forget everything... and I'd like you all to participate with me.  I'm taking down the "critiques" from the site, as critiquing shouldn't happen on memoirs ;) but I would like you all to write to me describing, IN DETAIL, your earliest memory. Doesn't have to be pretty, doesn't have to be any specific length... just email it to me and I'll tell the world ASAP.  PLEASE participate? Pretty please? *puppy dog eyes*

       Kung POW!   I just got done watching this movie and I laughed a whooooooooooole lot. It was just a whole movie of o_O O_o moments, and definitely worth it to go see. If you haven't seen it... see it. That is, if you like stupid humor. This has lots of it. The second scene of the movie was so fucked up... oi. Go rent it and tell me what you think about the second scene, right before the credits ;)  Also, I wanted to discuss Amelie because I finally rented that last week. I really liked it, and wish it could be remade in English so some of the more ADD-riddled people can watch and enjoy it. Definitely an interesting film, with an adorable star. Yeh.

If you haven't played it or seen anything about it, you're playing God in an environment like Age of Empires, and you are basically apprenticing a newborn baby creature, either a cow, orangutan or a tiger.

      PIMPEST SHIT EVER.  All right peeps, check it.  I'm really drunk right now... really drunk... and so is John. We each got like 10 shots extra tonight because....  JOHN WON $250.00!!!!!  That's right. It was like, Hawaiian night or somthing tonight, and whomever got the most lais, male and female, would share  500 350  250 dollars. They would also get a chance to win a jet ski. Well here's the dilly:  The girl who won had 73 lais. John had 16. He got these from a) 5 from our party, b) 3-4 from our party, who got them from guys, but the rest were ALL HIM. He totally whored himself out to the girlz at the bar, a waitress, a beer girl, all for lais. No other guy had ANY lais, so John just straight up won 250 bucks. He gave 20 each to the girls in our party, we bought maybe 20 bucks worth of booze and are splitting the rest. Question for my peeps: What should we buy? I want either a new video game console, or a new weight bench. Beings as I'm a big fatty, I should probably get the wieght bench. What do you, my peeps, suggest?  *edit*The guy who SHOULD have won had like 50 lais but he was ONE FUCKING MINUTE late and John won. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA so we feared getting beaten because the guy was tres pissed that he was too late and John won. We laughed at him. It was great. OH YEAH.  Oh man, we were screaming and celebrating so much tonight. The girlz were all over John for being a stud. It was really great.  Background: It's Janet, my sister in law, Jay's wife's birthday on Sunday... we went out for mexican, embarassed Jay, a lot, had three margaritas, went to the bar, had a double j&c, four j&c's, a jello shot, smirnoff ice, and nine shooters (kamikaze etc). JOHN had: Two margaritas, four long beach iced teas(aka long island with cranberry instead of coke) two jello shots and 10 shots. The Mall of America is brutal on the checkbook, but omg WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO John can I get a WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO?  Also, at the bar the bartender and a waitress were in Bikinis. That broke my heart. :(  All right so um, I can't remember what else. i'll post more kool stuff.  PS: I'm on a pimp new computer now.woo?

       urlLink Education Minnesota   I've decided I have a cause I want to fight for. I have shown hints of this, and of that in the past, but nothing (except being pro-life, which isn't worth all the arguing), pisses me off CONSISTENTLY like Jesse "the pigfucker" Ventura's treatment of Minnesota education.  My favorite anecdote on the situation: The University of Minnesota, MY University of Minnesota, is in the top five schools in the nation for medical schools... and their payroll is not even in the top TWENTY!  Pigfucker's argument? "Why would any professor make more than the Governer of Minnesota?" And with that, he demanded salary cuts.  I hate Ventura. I really really do, and I want to beat his ass, too. Actually, I want to beat his son Ray-Ray's ass, because I'm sure Ventura could still rip my heart out. I would beat Ashtray's ass and then maybe in 30 years I will pay a visit to old pigfucker in the 'home.  Feh.     In Canada I was drinking with a few Canucks and we talked about a bunch of stuff -- did I post about this? Doesn't matter -- One thing that came up was that the young woman I was talking to was going to school for... was it sociology? And she was going to be a teacher. When she heard I was in Liberal Arts she didn't wince like Americans do. Why not? Because in Canada, there is GOOD MONEY in teaching. Apparently the teachers union up there owns a large food... manufacturer, or some sort of food chain. Maple Leaf Foods I think it was... anyway, this equals BIG power for teachers, as they don't get pushed around like our teachers do. This equals BIG money for teachers. I think if reform doesn't come soon I will move to Canada, where I can teach and make good money, and any kids I have can have good teachers.

      I came up with an idea yesterday, when I saw a well-paid city worker standing around holding a "SLOW" sign.  Why are they paid $15.00 an hour to stand around holding a sign, instead of actually working?  My idea is this: Find beggars to take their place. clean them up, put on an orange vest, and give them a sign. Instead of saying "Will work for food," it will say "SLOW."   They will be paid good money, and they will be working, so it's a win-win situation for all parties! What do you think?

       Pit day!   Ugh... so people who know me know I accidentally stayed up until 1:00 AM CST, for my 7:00 AM CST wakeup call, and ended up working till 7:00 PM CST. Okay so I wasn't exactly working the entire time... I'm still a bit shaky loading rocks into a dump truck, though I'm perfectly okay digging and sorting with the skid loader (aka bobcat, tiny front-end loader...?) So anyway, eventually I will be able to load myself... it's not about ability, I can do it fine and have in the past, but one time loading for my dad the ground was too bumpy and I tipped and scraped the back of his truck and ever since then I've been kind of afraid. ANYWAY not like you care.     While out there I worked on my tan (gave my bald head some sun for the first time since I was a baby), and did some walking -- barefoot. Then while wading through the mud, I remembered that there are organisms that like to burrow through the bottom of your feet, and thought to myself... omg so like, am I gonna die from some microorganism now? That would TOTALLY suck.  But I am not really worried since I don't care.  Anyway, while walking I had a little bird nest pointed out to me in the middle of the rocks, and the eggs looked like rocks, and it was just in a little hole in the mud, and there was this baby bird there that appeared to be dead... but it wasn't... it was just playing dead because people were near. Its mother was about 10 yards away ruffling her feathers and screeching bloody murder to take our attention away from her nest. I thought that was sweet -- and very cool how nature works out like that.  Anyway, after eating one of the eggs (just kidding), I went for my walk, and found an egg shell maybe 30 yards away from the nest, in some fresh mud. Iiiiinteresting.  I also saw a pretty good-sized frog, with which I had a long staring contest.... but then I had to get back to work and scared it away :(  If anyone's traveling through Minnesota let me know and I'll try setting up a day at the pit... it's perfectly quiet and beautiful. Especially today, as it was 85 degrees, no clouds, a light breeze and NO HUMIDITY finally. Today was the most perfectest day ever.  That's why I'm in a good mood despite not sleeping much, and you know, having to work. O_o

Eerie.  Oh yeah, John was the one to cut it. God, I've never seen him as happy as he was to shave my head. o_O  Also, I learned that the little birthmark on the side of my head really isn't small at all, rather basically my head is purple except for a few patches of normal skin. That was an exaggeration. Basically, I've got a big birthmark on my head. O_o  Geeze, the girlz won't be attracted to me anymore.  AHAHAHAHAHAHA woooo hiya.

       Pit Duty   It was too hot today, thank God, because I had been picked up to work the pit, and I was on fire. The ramp to the tractor trailer dug into the blacktop because it was really soft. But it's after 3, and if I went to the pit I'd need to go in... under 4 hours. Hmmmm. I wonder if I can survive. It's not very long... but seriously, ever since I got heat stroke out there I've been SCAAAAARED.

       Speak and Spell   John pulled out his old Speak & Spell today and put batteries in it. I believe it's as old as I am, and still works fine. Did anyone else have one? These were definitely the coolest inventions ever. Especially back then; the technology was extremely advanced to have something so fun and interactive. Everyone should have one.   Shallow Hal   Eh, it was kinda funny, but I liked the message. I don't really want to talk about it because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but as far as the movie is concerned, it's... eh. All right. I don't exactly have any detailed critique of the movie, but Farrelly bros. films don't usually elicit much of a response from me.   Happy Fourth   I just dug out my old fireworks. Since Jesse "The Pig Fucker" Ventura legalized ground fireworks, I'm going to have some fun tomorrow. BBQ, then pyromania. It will be great. I have my 500 black cat string ready for the grand finale. That's gonna be one annoying motherfucking piece of work right there ;)

        xXx   Here is something I posted on a message board, first regarding Vin Diesel as an actor, and second regarding the movie xXx itself.     First of all what's this whole "HE IS NOT THAT HOT AND CAN'T ACT" bullshit?  Arnold  Sylvester  :wtf:  Which those two won an oscar, or a "sexiest man alive" award?  Exactly! They had bodies. They could act like badasses. They're Vin Diesel. However, Vin imho looks better, is more "realistic" body-wise, has a cool voice AND a cool name, unlike his predecessors. Therefore, Vin superior, Arnold and Sly inferior.  As for the movie... I liked it. It was just an underachieving yet promising first attempt at an American James Bond (Wedge told me this wasn't the first, but I stated that the plot and a lot of the movie were direct ripoffs of Bond, making it more of a direct replica, not just an answer to Bond).  My problems with the film were first and very, very foremost the music. Cheesy and campy at times (if you felt the movie got a bit corny at times you were probably sucked into the music), and that was the score. The soundtrack -- the non-score songs -- were all misplaced. I could not feel any of the music in the film. They even had the corny "Bond-esque" music playing in real tense suspenseful moments, probably to create more levity, so that the crowd could have a "good time."  I think a good huge chunk of the stunts were far too over-the-top, such as the motorcycle(motorbike?) scenes, where he basically jumped off the ramp of a building and was what, 5 stories up in the air, with the fire right on his back without damaging him or even knocking him off course, and he landed seemlessly and kept driving. I started feeling like someone turned the no-grav cheat on in a video game.   Other than that, THIS WAS AN ACTION MOVIE! so you know, things like the convenience of a heat-seaking missile really weren't that ridiculous, considering how James Bond is a really shitty spy, since he always ALWAYS gets caught, and instead of escaping, most of the time people either let him live, or save him. Things like that remind me why action/spy movies are not supposed to be subjected to such rigorous scrutiny that people tend to use lately -- not just with these movies, but all movies. Every single movie is expected to make you think, yet it's the movies which try too hard to make you think and fail that are given the most applause. Pfffft.

While I will not slip into denial about me being a grade-a major loser, I'm deleting my whining posts from the last few days because, well, why the hell did I post them in the first place?

      The time... 9:00 AM  The breakfast... a dry toasted onion bagel.  All I have to say now, is this morning strikes me as painfully hard to swallow. O_o  I already finished my milk unfortunately, and now I am wasting time away until my bus comes in an hour and change.  I haven't had anything really to say the past while, which I'm sure has broken the hearts of one person: my imaginary internet stalker. That's right, I still want a stalker, so if you're interested in stalking me please drop me a line. Chances are you'll have a better chance of being chosen as my stalker if you're female, because I wouldn't be as flattered/scared if a guy did it.   Anywho my classes are annoying and so long that when I come back I am usually feeling noncreative, so...  Look at this, even now I wanted to post just to say something and it's totally just me mumbling, or scribbling, or whatever you want to call it.  Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo...  -Vikings suck -Blade II was good, but a bit too cartoony in places. -Charmed is a wonderful show. Too much clothing involved -I'm serious about the stalker thing. I'm lonely... so running away screaming from a nice girl would really brighten up my day. -Art scholars are PRETENTIOUS and I hate them. -So are most writers. Shall I become the first writer who isn't a chain smoker/alcoholic? -Geoffry Chaucer should have written in modern English, or at least in complete French so people would TRANSLATE HIM god damn it -Vikings suck -Cept Chris Hovan who will continue to rawk until he's in the Pro Bowl. -Oh and Moe Williams, who is way underutilized in the Vikings' "tire out the other team's offense by continually giving them the ball" scheme.  PS: What is with the phrase "out like a fat kid in dodge ball?" I am offended... I was a fat kid and I often won dodgeball. It's not about being fat, it's about being fat, slow and uncoordinated. I dodged as well as the skinny kids, and caught balls better than them.  Anyway, consider that me signing out... bye bye boyzzzzz and girlzzzzz

      Mye 1st dai of skoll  by Alfa BeEn  Awright so in the wee hours of the morning I finally found the route and times for my bus and was able to go to bed. I also just read my schedule last night o_O I know, I'm stupid, but I like the element of surprise.  Anyway so I can't think of much to say... at least nothing that isn't completely shallow pertaining to the members of the female body. I won't say any of that because I'm a sensitive guy and I don't think about petty shit like that!!!!  Anyway, what I did notice is that the J'Lo look is taking over. It's J'Lo's top and glasses and tight jeans with feathered hair. GRR. I love J'Lo but I hate the look... I mean it doesn't look bad, but the fact that it's thousands of girls dressed the same... leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  ALSO the number of Andre the Giant one-strap shirts is increasing. I HATE that.  Coming from the bathroom earlier on, this nerdy kid was about to open the bathroom door, and since I have a germ phobia I was watching him waiting to get out before the door closed and I had to use my hands. ANYWAY, the door FLIES open and busts this kid in his head, the poor guy... he puts his hand to his head and is like "OW OW ow oh..." and falls down.The guy comes in and laughs and says "You all right man?" And the kid says "y yeah... I I'm fine..." and he woozily makes it out and goes on his way. That was one hell of a thud.  Anyway, I've got my work cut out for me this semester o_O  More observations later!

       While we're talking about childhood...   I just wanted to ask yall if you have paid attention to the freshness of the minds of children? In fiction, we are being taught to make strange all of the everyday things we face, to treat the world as though it is an entirely new entity, much like a child upon witnessing the world for the first time.  When Josh first started becoming aware, and able to make sounds (not quite talking), he and I would sit outside on the steps with him on my lap or on my shoulder, and he would look up at the sky and point (as he did in the video with his grandma). That is one of my favorite memories ever... me and Josh walking around, him pointing at things and me telling him what they were. Things we take for granted, like sidewalks, like bugs, like cars driving by on the street.   A professor once said something about walking down a city street with a kid, and if you pay attention, the child will point out some of the strangest things we are trained to ignore. Things we are taught to be insignificant to our minds and imaginations.   Libby posted on her site about teaching her cousin things, and oh my god nothing is greater  than knowing you've taught a child new information (as I have just signed up to tutor Samantha), but I think the one thing greater than teaching a child, is learning from a child.  As I said in my last "serious" post, Josh has taught me the importance of life. He as also taught me how to expand my world to include others -- when we go out, my eyes are always on him, and when they're not, he's never out of the corner of my eye. When I make decisions, I plan ahead to make sure he will be ok, and always prepare myself to handle Josh. Where are the exits? More importantly, WHERE ARE THE BATHROOMS?  Because Josh is in my life, I am now losing weight. I want to be healthy. I want to be fit enough to play sports with him. I want to live long enough to see him blossom into a man, and see if my impression on him was strong enough to make him a good man. I don't want him to remember me as the fat uncle who never did anything, or the uncle he knew as a kid, but the uncle whose funeral he attended when he was 16, or the uncle who just isn't around anymore.  I have told Josh, time and time and time again, "talk to me. Ask me anything you want to know." Now he asks. Oh, does he ever ask! And I answer. And when he asks, it forces me to rethink things. Things I take for granted. Why do I do this? Why do I do anything? There are explanations for everything, and if there is no explanation, then I have no reason to do something.   He keeps me on my toes. He will challenge my ideas merely by asking "why?" and "why not?" and always presents me with an alternative. Why don't I choose the alternate route? Why do I do what I do, and not something else? And I laugh. I laugh because he's so smart, and because I'm so stupid, and because when he challenges me it makes me realize all the more why I love him.  EVERYONE should have a Josh.

       Jackass   This isn't really a review. You really can't review this movie. This movie isn't really a movie. Jackass the movie is just a bunch of skits/segments/vignettes/outtakes/clips/whatever from the show Jackass; generally things they can't show on MTV, and in generally so so so much worse.  In fact, if I was a prude or squeamish, I would definitely boycott this film. But as it stands, I really did enjoy it. It's every young white trash male's dream to do some of the things they do, as they make asses of themselves in public, hurt each other and themselves, get in lots of trouble and get really, really wasted.   Don't let them fool you: When Johnny Knoxville gets really hurt doing... something, you see he is sitting on the ground drinking some mysterious brown liquid from a brown-tinted clear jar. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Curiouser and curiouser.  Anyway... it's definitely a movie you can't see alone, and one you have to own on video to play when you and friends are getting very drunk or otherwise fucked up. If you want to go see it again, I'll come with. I've forgotten a lot of the bits in it, but they were good.  I really can't rate this film, even if I rated films ;) but Jackass is in a league of its own. It has no plot, no acting, per se, but you won't stop laughing for more than 30 seconds throughout the whole thing. That is what makes it special.     Sorry no long serious posts today or yesterday or maybe tomorrow etc., I really can't think of anything to post, eh.  Anyway, the 2nd is Josh's birthday. He's turning FIVE. I promised to buy him a cool fast sled for his birthday, so that he shall get. And as of today (Sunday) happy birthday Robyn :P

       Hobbled and hallucinating!   Argh, it hurts me to try making headlines for my posts. Not that it's hard, I just find it so... presumptuous and pretentious as though my posts are some sort of gold that need a title in case someone cites me in a research paper or something. Ah hell, I'm too tired to dwell on that right now anyway.  The paper I had to get done? Yeah, I started that at 1 am and finished at 5:15, before getting up at 8:15. Needless to say, my body didn't get a sufficient opportunity to heal itself from the stress I put it through during the day. To lose weight I have been walking instead of busing around campus, and up stairs instead of elevators, which has had a profound effect on me, but has also stressed me out pretty bad too.  You see... when I had surgery in 91, they took out what, like 60% of the muscle of my knee area. This means I have no strength in my left quad, and all the stress goes on the joint, surrounding muscles, ligaments and cartilege.  Nobody cares so I'll go on.  I'm extra super loopy and I was just thinking of stuff I could discuss with yall, but I realized my focus is shrinking and I can't come up with anything on my own.   My Lit Prof was discussing the Apocalypse today, and gave us a writing exercise: If the world was going to end in five minutes, what do you think those five minutes would be like?  I said that (in my humblest of opinions) the first minute there would be silence. People would be letting it sink in. On the second minute, anyone who is prone to cry will start crying, and on the third and fourth minutes, anyone who can't cry will otherwise lash out. There will be suicides and random violence for two minutes, before, for the fifth and final minute, we would all watch and wait. This was me on three hours sleep at 9:45 AM mind you. If I was better rested, I would have said something about aliens for sure. What do you all think would happen if we had five minutes before the end of the world?  Well my point is, my Lit professor is a morbid son of a bitch. He tells us stories of people dying all the time, and makes references to the DC Sniper and other such goodies to get his points across.  Part of me thinks that's cool, that he's so open with his dark side, but there is a part of me that really can't stand it.  This is a silent part of me that rears its ugly head every so often when confronted with the morbid or depressing.  I used to have no fears and was as callous as you could be, but the night I stood in the hospital room as my grandpa died, something in me snapped. First of all, I became less superficially sensitive... less apt to feel bad about what people say about me... but on the other hand, I gained a respect for, and a hatred of death.  A couple months later I came across a picture of a man... well, let's just say it was a morbid death picture. It made me feel nauseus -- but not in the stomach, but all over... just like every part of me was sick and wanted to throw up.  Until recently, it kind of went away... but now I can't watch any tragedies on TV without getting that feeling -- even in my fiction class, when we read a Raymond Carver story about a couple pulling their child until it (allegedly) breaks, or is pulled apart. I couldn't bring myself to face the story. We had to write what we thought happened at the end, and I really, really didn't want to.  I don't really like being sensitive about such things. I wish I could make it go away and be a cold bastard like I was meant to be, but I can't. The year before my grandpa died, Josh was born. In that short time, I finally had reason to respect life and death.  I won't get into exactly why I'm at odds with my sensitive self lately. I was reintroduced to it recently by someone, but in the end I regretted it. Just leave it at that.  Now I want to go club a baby seal. I couldn't do it, by any means, but damn do I ever want to.

       When last we met...   ...I was discussing the importance of nature, the expansive and unknown in my creative life. As time wore on, my grandpa's farm was shut down to me and my family. As a little kid, my great aunt had a huge farm in North Dakota and it was wonderful, because it had a little woods, and it had horses, and it had endless fields of flatness (as North Dakota does.) Grandpa's farm was full of hills, while this... was endless. Looking back, that's what I want.  So I repeat: As time wore on, and I lost access to the farms, I took refuge on the water. When I can, I make a trip to Lake Superior during the summertime, and if I am allowed (most people find this boring), I will sit on the shore for as long as I possibly can and stare out at the water, and listen to the waves crashing, drowning out my thoughts.  I've only been to the ocean once, christmastime 2000 in Florida. I never got to fully enjoy it because I feared the jellyfish, but it was most definitely refreshing to watch. Not yet since those bygone days on the farms have I had the chance to get lost in nature. The longer I go without, the more I feel myself be irreversibly emotionally drained.  That being said, when I think of myself as a country or a city person, I am first, foremost and undeniably city. I couldn't survive a day in the country. I was born and raised in the city, and it's all I know. However, I really... I can't be comfortable here (I wrote a poem about this, it's in my writings section, amongst my retchedly horrible poetry, entitled I Wanna Go Home).  Here comes the sentimental, fruity part.  Sometimes I feel like a domesticated animal. I was not born free, but I have it in my blood. I have seen the wild and I want to be there, but I know I can't. All I know is my cage and captivity. I know being taken care of, security and no responsibilities. I'm completely dependent.  This, of course, holds true for me in general, as I have yet to move out on my own, but basically it holds true for Nature. Nature is where I want to be, but I do not think it's where I belong. I don't know how to mediate between the two, and I don't know if I am ready to try.  I think I'm starting to feel like the (Literary) Romantics who went on their pastorals or excursions into the woods to escape from the monotony of everyday city life. That somehow the rustic, simple existence justified and validated them. I'm a spoiled college student who knows only traffic congestion and graffiti and skyscrapers. Maybe a bit of the old rustic lifestyle would do me well. I am getting so fucking tired of worrying about tomorrow. I spend so much time dwelling on yesterday, that with the future, I've really got no time to dwell on anything new.  I need a vacation. Not a vacation, an escape. I do not want to worry about things, I don't want to make decisions. I don't want "where shall we stay?" or "where shall we eat?" I want the most simple, unplanned escape where I don't have to make any decisions or worry.  In short... I do not want to seek out, I want to discover. I want reactive instead of proactive. I want, if just for a few short hours, to regain that piece of my childhood where my imagination and my creativity were at their peak.  And Jake, I don't want to be a kid again, I just want that one thing. I could verymuch do without wetting the bed, thank you very much.  I think that's what I had to say. There is probably more, but I'll just leave it at that.

       While I put off writing...   Careful... this is going to be slightly fruity and sentimental, but well, it's something that I thought and may or may not believe -- with me, you can never be sure, right? But my art teacher said something about the environment which first inspired your creativity... the place where you can associate your creative self. Obviously she was talking about artists, but my being a writer(ha), can still relate.  Growing up, the greatest places I could ever be were farms. Endless, expansive,  new  territory, at least to the younger me. I remember walking for what to me felt like hours and hours at my Grandpa's farm, through corn fields up hills, to the murky, frightening swamp. I would wear my shoes after a rain and get them caked with mud, and try to crack as much of the dried sheets of clay as I could; and when it was dry I would take my shoes off and wiggle my toes in the superfine sand on the roads.  But most of all I loved the exploring. The coolest thing to a little kid back then was walking through a corn field and finding a burrow -- a flattening of some stocks of corn right in the middle of the field. We never knew what the hell it was. Every flattening or bunching of grass was a nest and every hole was a den, and there could be an animal nearby!  As a kid, I wanted so badly to be an archaeologist, mainly because I love the dirt, I love to dig and I love finding things. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as I've never seen it before, I love it. Or I did back then.  I've slowly been losing my creativity the last several years -- my grandpa had a stroke I believe in 1992, and he died almost exactly five years later. After his stroke, his son -- my uncle -- forbade anyone from going to the farm. Basically, it was gutted out and turned into a gravel pit, while more and more of the heart of my Grandpa's farm was ripped out and hauled somewhere. It's been over 10 years since I've had the chance to explore it. I know this isn't the reason for my creative lapse, but I know that it was definitely the disconnection of me from the place that inspired my creativity.   I will cut it off here, in case you actually decided to read this post, I will say more later, because I have a bit more to rant about if you care.  Until then, I've got a paper to (not) write.   Later!  PS: I am officially 38 lbs lighter than I was last time I was weighed. In celebration, I subsequently ate 10 pizzae.    O_o

I think Josh got me sick, or I got him sick, cause he's got a cold now too.  Thank God for NyQuil though... I've been sleeping lots this weekend.  However, next week I have two midterms and a paper to do. :( Argh.   So today I bought two tickets for Dec. 9th Tom Petty and Jackson Browne. Woo?  Other than that, bye.

       Vikings 31, Lions 24    WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO oh man that was great. If the Vikes hadn't won today I would have been really heartbroken over the Twins losing (You'll never get the fiver off me, Wendi, neverrrrrrrrrrrrrr!) :(  *sigh*  So back to the game... I sat in the corner of the end zone in the nosebleed section. That was great. Lots of old people and babies without ear plugs... what the hell? It is so unbelievably loud in there, I mean wow... o_O John and I were the only two people screaming in our section. A lady a couple rows up (no seats filled in front of us) looked at me and smiled because I'm such a loud bastard. Now my throat hurts. Bugger.  So I have two comments on the national anthem:  1) Firehouse performed it. Oh man that ruled. FIREHOUSE! OH YEAH!  2) Why don't women take their hats off during the national anthem? What the hell is that? What kind of double standard allows women to disrespect the flag while the men have to take their hats off? I didn't see one woman take her hat off, and I saw one old man leave his hat on. What the hell is  that ?  Old men ALWAYS take their hats off. That's just crazy. What a bastard. I should have said something to him.  Anyway, what sucks about nosebleed section is that all the hot girls are on the lower level, and that just costs too much money, so forget that!  Oh, one more thing... I HATE peeing in a trough. Why aren't women forced to piss together in a trough? It's only fair. EQUAL BATHROOMS FOR EQUAL SEXES! That's what I always say.  *sigh*  Twins...

      CHER!   o_O  I really have not much to say, except that today while doing my work (I know! What the fuck?) at school, I looked up and saw two ugly, ugly women walk by. One happened to be like 6'5 and looked like Cher.  Five minutes later, aforementioned, ahem, "girl" walked by again, with a guy holding a ghetto blaster and playing some Cher song while "she" lip synched. Erm.  I wonder what that was all aboot, but I must tell you it was very interesting; better than being harassed by the bees all the fucking time. It's Minnesota and cold as hell, why are there still bees and mosquitoes out?  John and I got to do some hard labor tonight and the painting was great due to the buggage. By the by, John came back last night from Florida and the Bahamas. I won't say more, because this isn't AlphaBeansGayBrother.net.  Oh no.  Now tell me, dear, how does that make you feel?

You sorry whores are GOING DOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWN.  Jarod Washburn? Pfffft Washburn is a shitty high school (my alma mater) and is a shitty pitcher. I mean what are you gonna do, have him pitch 4 out of 7 games and hope he wins all 4? Can you handle Radke Reed Milton and Mays? Naw didn't think so!  The Twins took Bud Selig's attempt to kill them personally, and they're taking it out on the world! Wooooooooooo  It's the real life Indians from "Major League"!  Finally a Minnesota team I can be semi-proud of! AJ Pierzynski and Doug Mientkewicz are my favorite baseball players, and they have the hardest names to spell, too ;)  So Wendi, what?

      Go Twinkies!  I have to admit, I was impressed with the strategy of the game today. I have had debates over whether baseball is anything special or not, and I have to admit that when you play smart, it really is a joy to watch.  However, when it's like, the NY Yankees or the Atlanta Braves, it's just like clockwork. HR, HR, HR, K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K, HR. But finally, FINALLY somebody used intelligence to surpass the brute force of the Yankees. I like it.  Now if only the Twins can win and upset those upstart bastard Angels! o_O     Ooh I wanted to show you guys my Halloween decorations. They're not really Halloween decorations, rather just decorations that Josh picked out for me that are littered around my room. I'll take those pictures now and upload in a few minutes then I'm going to bed. Night!                                   The Eye of the Storm I won when I was like 10, and the skulls were left to me when Josh's dad moved out of the house. Everything else Josh saw at the store and said I had to have it, so somebody bought for me the mummy lamp (with a candle in its head, unlit), the Abominable Snowman, the hanging spider, the heavy stone gargoyle, the grim reaper (he's huge, look next to him, that's my 19" TV he's dwarfing.) and that ghost standup thingie as well. I forgot to take a picture of the Chuckie (Child's Play fame) doll he picked out for me as well.  Josh rules and you all suck because you don't have your own Josh. :)

      :(  I'm in such a bad mood guys. I got workshopped for my story today, and everyone had major issues with it. The teacher spent a good several minutes telling me why it sucked without saying one good thing, and I don't write to be criticized, I do it for encouragement. I know that critique is an important part of writing, but what the hell?  I can take constructive criticism well, I just can't handle what I got today.   It reminds me of my dad.  I got the notion that I might just stop writing, but that was a gay thought, however I don't know how passionate I can be about writing in this class when the teacher doesn't make it something I enjoy doing. So I need comforting for my wounded ego. Who's got some for me?

Does someone else want to make a new template for me? That'd be ssssssssssssuper.  Anyway, I signed up for this when I wanted people to visit my site though they'll probably look and say "BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" and hurt my feelings :( but I'm all right with that. Honest... I am... honest...  I have so many issues posting. I need to turn this into a commenting only blog so that Nicole can see my comments! That's where I'm a viking!!! Oh yeah.  And an about page... grr.... I don't want to do that ;) I suppose it wouldn't hurt though... N E WAYZ  Vote me a 5!     Yeah I know huh, so I was on the bus today and there were two guys with wicked mullets and one of them looked exactly like this guy   and he was reading a "CONVERSACIO(with an accent)N EN INGLES" book. The other was this normal freaky white dude with a mullet. I really like mullets.  Also, at school, we have lots of midgets, and there's one short guy -- I don't think he's a midget, but he has long hair and a beard/mustache, and in the winter he wears this red wool cap so he looks like a tree gnome! It's so cool. Not to mention all the Jesus lookalikes, as well....  It's a shame most of what I have to say about my day revolves around the bus. The most interesting people in the world are on the bus, because the non-interesting people drive their fancy cars.     Why did I just add another horizontal line? I'm leaving.  GO HOME! GO HOME!

      OH MY GOD.  If I pass all of my current classes,  I am 13 credits away from graduating, with 9 of them being upper division courses! WOOOOOOOOOO! :)  *dances*  Now, I didn't know this, so I can't graduate yet, but if all goes well, I think I could get a good senior paper set up for the Summer or Fall, and graduate then. Also, I need an internship, which is a bitch since I gotta put in for it, like, a year ahead of time (oops :()  Does anyone work somewhere that could hook up an English major with an internship? *bats eyelashes*  I have to keep  focused here, because it would be so easy to just take the easy Senior paper, get it all done and get out of there, but then I have no future at all.  ACH. This means I have to look to the future. Shit shit shit. What do I do? I don't know if I have the confidence to be a teacher. I do, however, have the ego to want to change the world. That may make a difference in whether I become a teacher. But I don't know. Once I graduate an English major, there goes any aspiration of Advertising I may have had.  I've said it before I'll say it again: I took waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long to care. I didn't care about a goddamn thing before this year and now I'm left picking up the pieces. *shakes head*  SOMEONE HELP ME. SOMEONE MAKE DECISIONS FOR ME. I CAN'T BE AN ADULT :(

      Since nobody has commented on any of my posts I take it nobody is reading, or those who are reading don't care. Well let me tell you something, sister. I don't care either!  I've had major attitude the last few days so maybe it's best I haven't blogged, but then what do I care? It's fun shaking things up. Not that I plan on doing that. Whatever.  Yesterday I had a big ole presentation to do for an art class, and I rocked at it. The rest of my group sucked because they didn't want to coordinate, and one of the guys didn't even do fuckall for it, but I helped everyone do better and hopefully that will reflect better on me. I got lots of "good job!"s from my teammates and teacher(+TAs), which was cool except I realized that I'm 22, in a class with a bunch of 18/19 year olds and I probably did much, much worse than I should be able to do at this level. He he he oh well. It was a blast. I spoke in front of a crowd and didn't faint. How's that for progress?  Another thing I'd like to discuss is that today I was talking to a girl from my fiction class and we were gossipping about the teacher. She mentioned that whenever she talks about him he appears behind her and it freaks her out. We got on the bus and were still talking about him, though we were no longer talking shit, just saying what he did/said to us in conferences, and then after a few minutes I leaned down (as I was standing) and told her I hoped I wasn't too loud. She looked confused, so I pointed up at our teacher and said "Bob's right there." She freaked out.   The man is like the villian in a horror movie. Not that he's a psycho killer, but he pops up randomly. The debate is, did he hear us? I don't know if he did, as we were pretty far back, but depending on how loud someone is, they resonate quite a bit and COULD be heard. I do not remember how loud we were, so I do not know if he heard us or not, as I only saw the back of his head.  My question to you guys: How can I know if he heard? I feel really bad, because I was saying things we talked about in conference -- I didn't talk shit, per se, but I did pretty much engage in gossip and said some things I shouldn't have said, though they were mainly things I would say to his face if I had to. He's a pretty tough teacher, as I stated in an earlier post about him being a dick. He's not so much a dick, just very strict and rigorous which I can't fault him for, as that makes for better students. Anyway, I thought we were getting along all righttt, but if he heard me I have no idea what he may say or think.  oOoOOoOh suspense. On a similar note, I have until the end of the month to write my next draft of my story. That's a lot of time, but I haven't started because I suck majorly. You kids take care now. And feel free not to reply, too.

       Brain On Overdrive   Okay I am going to ramble these things and they're going to make little sense, but lately my mind has just been working overdrive with all kinds of cool shit from school, from friends and from Minnesota politics, etc.  First of all, I have a presentation due on Monday, and it's on Icons. The thing is, it's on four different aspects of the icon, and a half hour, and honestly I could talk for an hour on my article alone. There are four articles:   The Image (wherein text and ideas give way to icons, and become obsolete);   Icons (wherein we lose the significance of something unattainable and religions via icons, i.e. everything Christ embodies has been summed up in a cross, or a fish, and the emotion of love is iconified by a heart-shaped box, or a bouquet of roses);   Place and its relation to Icons (Where we are from shapes how we view others, and how others view us: Basically a discussion of stereotyping and how it has simplified interpersional relations: We no longer see individuals, but types. We no longer have to deliberate the humanity of a person, because we know what kind of person they are because of the stereotype the media gives us. This idea is pretty old hat, though);   Flags, and their relation: (Basically, the American flag is supposed to be an Icon. For those who burn the American flag, it is a symbol for everything that is wrong with America. For those who oppose flag burning, it is an icon for everything right. In my opinion, this fits in with all the other arguments because it is cheapening everything America stands for -- by turning it into a $.99 piece of nylon sold by the bushel at roadside stands after 9/11... it's just so cheapened that we can take a piece of cloth, use it as the icon for a stereotype of a group of individuals, and use the burning of a flag as a way to injure the stereotype. I think that if we were to realize that what people burn isn't us individually, but of the view of all Americans they have been granted because of a) where they live and b) where we live, then the burnings wouldn't be so offensive. And if we were not so uptight about flag burning, then it wouldn't be done so often, as it's only an attention ploy.    It's late and I don't have time to keep going right now, so I'll talk about this or something else at a later time.  I am the Icon of all things Beany. Oh yeah.

       Josh turns FIVE   Hi. How do?  I haven't been in a posting mood lately, but that's not to say I'm in a bad mood lately. I've been alternating -- on Friday, I was in a great mood, but had my mood destroyed by some wonderful news, but I won't get into that. Long story short, my mood has been infinitely better this year than it was last year. I had assumed that I had seasonal affect or something, as cold weather always made me depressed but... I'm no more depressed than I ever am, so that's a plus. Thanks or no thanks to other people, I'm doing ok :)  Anywho, I spent the day at Chuck E Cheese's with Josh and a dozen or so of his best young friends, and, well, I am exhausted. I didn't exactly do all that much, right, but with all those kids, how is it possible not to be exhausted? Geesh.  So anyway, nothing much to note except Josh did the strength test, with a mallet and lights that light up telling you how strong you are. You start out by saying boy/girl and age (4 and under) (5-8) (8+) and Josh, in his first day as a five year old, hit 5-8 and BAM! First shot he lit up all the lights. Yeah he's buff!  For his birthday I got him a SnowSkate, a skateboard without wheels you use in the snow (whenever it snows), and it rocks.  I've been in kind of a minifunk though which I have to work out of, I just have to not let shit get to me, because shit doesn't usually get to me because I rule.  Anyway, just thought I'd force a post. Talk later.

Homegirl has worms and loves biting, and when she's not biting, she's shitting on the carpet, so I put her outside where she's afraid of the neighbor dog, and it's too cold for her, so she sits outside the door and shivers and I feel horrible.  It's just... argh. Tuesday she's going to the vet.

      Well kids, it seems finals studying has been put on hold today. Yep that's right, I've found yet another reason not to study. Here she is:   urlLink My new puppy!   So here's my problem: I don't know what to name her!  I figured that since I've got her and won't be getting any studying done, I can name her "F." Or, more appropriately, since my family met the woman who owns her while they were dumpster diving (woooooooo how ghetto!) Okay so it's not so bad. WalMart had a fire and they threw out all their christmas stuff... so my family got a whole lot of ribbons and bows and ornaments, and some teddy bears, a couple christmas trees... and two puppies! Josh and Sam get one too; a boy. Mine's a girl... Anyway, since we got her while Dumpster Diving (I didn't participate, was studying), and I'll be getting D's in my classes... DeeDee? I hate the names, they're meant as jokes. Anyway...  I like the name Holly, a little. Christmas and all, but I think I'd get bored of it. Since she's such a girl, I could name her Spike.I love Greek myth, so I might name her something from there, or maybe a comic book character. Whatever it is, it's gotta be unique.  Bah, I gotta think of a name fast >:o  Anyway...  She's 8 weeks old, a german shepherd/lab/pitt bull mix (and more I think), and she's got the most adorable blue eyes. She's twitching in a basket next to me, is that normal? O_o  Um, yeah. So I gotta get shots, gotta name her, gotta buy her some food and stuff. Aw man.  I actually had my eye on the one who looked like a german shepherd, but this one came up to me and started licking my face, so I decided that she chose me, and I didn't choose her. And to top it all off, on the ride home she peed on me, so I guess that means she likes me! :P  Argh, I have so much work to do... and awwwwwwwwwwww she's so cute.  So give me ideas for a name, and tell me how great she is.

      I got my story workshopped so on Wednesday I'll have a new version up. The biggest problems were not deep enough descriptions or back story, and too many ambiguities surrounding JR. Overall, they liked it better, but in the reply, my teacher said...  "you're a (positive adjective) student of writing, with (positive adjective) instincts."  I forget what it was for sure, but when he says that, does it mean I'm the kind of person who would be a good writing teacher, but not a good writer? :P  Anyway, I got a B- on my last one, and a B++ on this one. Sigh.  I have an entire semester worth of reading to do by Tuesday. I have my art final on Monday which shouldn't be so hard, and then the Lit final Tuesday, my story finished on Wednesday, and then I THINK Friday I have another paper due. If it's not Friday... then I'm fucked. God, I hope it's Friday. Anyway, just popping in. Going to bed now. It'll be the last full sleep I get for a week.  But then, wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

       Karma kicks Bean in the balls for his previous post!!!!!!!    It's official. There is no justice in the world. Yesterday, I was seething to the brim with anger at my sister in law for her ineptitude as a parent, and BOY was I regretting her being anyone's mother. Well it came back to bite me in the ass.  Here's what I told Libby:   AlphaBean: MOTHER AlphaBean: FUCKING AlphaBean: SHIT AlphaBean: AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SolVioleta: umm hi. AlphaBean: hi. AlphaBean: :-( SolVioleta: whats wrong AlphaBean: Guess SolVioleta: uhh. SolVioleta: umm SolVioleta: i dunnoo SolVioleta: your fam saw your post AlphaBean: It has to do with what I've been whining about lately SolVioleta: heh AlphaBean: no AlphaBean: worse SolVioleta: what? AlphaBean: Well... AlphaBean: What is the big picture problem? SolVioleta: sam.. AlphaBean: Like... whom am I mad at, for doing what? SolVioleta: her mother SolVioleta: for doing nothing? AlphaBean: Okay AlphaBean: So what does that make her mother? SolVioleta: would you TELL ME SolVioleta: =P AlphaBean: :-D SolVioleta: a bad mother? AlphaBean: It's more fun to play the guessing game AlphaBean: Okay, and what is the worst possible thing she could do? SolVioleta: for YOU SolVioleta: tell you to piss off AlphaBean: No no AlphaBean: What's the worst thing a bad mother can do? AlphaBean: Big picture SolVioleta: worst thing SolVioleta: i dunno there are a lot of bad things AlphaBean: well I mean AlphaBean: What's the most unhealthy for society AlphaBean: :-P AlphaBean: It's quite simple, and head-shakingly depressing SolVioleta: TELL ME! AlphaBean: You suck dude AlphaBean: She's pregnant SolVioleta: oh god.     Yep. My sentiments exactly.  So what do I do? I can't even PRETEND to be happy. I am not one to pretend. This is just bad. What do I do? I am asking that a lot. Will someone please tell me?     On a positive note, the MN Timberwolves just beat the LA Lakers for the first time in LA in like 8 years. OMG OMG So now I'm pissed and excited at the same time!  And on an unrelated note, I've spent the good part of the day working on my art project. I'll take pics of it later and show yall. It's hard to explain, so I'll have to do the pic thing.  Later.

       urlLink Josh and Sam (and John) Two Days After Thanksgiving    WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!  So I have a digital camera now, and you can expect lots of pictures to be uploaded (but none of me :P). These were the first pictures I took, really, and my cam only takes pictures of people! I'm still learning the ropes of it, but I'll figure it out eventually.  Why do I have a digital camera? Well, a couple years ago my super awesome camera was in a plastic baggie in a cooler on the Apple River in Wisconsin with assorted alcoholic beverages, food, and melting ice. I saw that the camera had gotten wet so I asked if anyone had a baggie I could use (the camera still worked), and someone offered their baggie.   By the way, I was extremely, extremely drunk, as the sun always heightens the buzz, but I couldn't really do anything for myself, so I let someone else put my camera in a baggie. Later on that day I looked and saw my camera in the water, inside an open sandwitch bag, and ARGH I was so pissed. I mean, I knew I should have been but I was a bit too drunk to really care, but I have been hurting ever since.   Anyway, recently a camera repair person looked at it, and after hearing what was wrong with it she suggested that the circuitry was fried and it would cost $200.00 to fix it. Yeah. Not gonna happen. So my favoritest camera of all time is fucked. Does anyone out there know anyone who can fix cameras? :(  Anyway, so this digi cam, when I got it, it was a pre-used version, and it was really shitty, and missing a bunch of stuff. So it was taken back, and when I opened the new box, there was no camera! Yeah, it was a display model, so it took three trips to the store to finally get it right, but I'm pretty happy.  I would have been happier if I'd gone to Best Buy and picked up the super discounted ones on Friday. ARGH I was so torn apart by the after Thanksgiving sales, but I knew I'd end up paying more than I wanted to... and I knew the "mail-in rebates" would NEVER come, because the people in charge of that are bastards. :(  So I've got a lot of homework to do, and I didn't do any all weekend. I've been too busy, after all. I didn't do anything that I couldn't have stopped to do my work, but I mean come on, if something comes up, I'll choose that over homework any day!

      You know what really sucks? When everyone -- and I mean everyone -- around you are uptight, irritable, depressed or unhappy. I'm not very good at being the source of my own happiness. I need help from outside, and I'm just surrounded by people moping.   I can't handle it. I've been depressed for like 15 years and I'm just now seeing the light at the end of the tunnel... I'm just now pulling myself out of depression, but now I know how everyone felt around me -- except times 20957024975. Now everyone's pulling me down with them, and that fucking sucks. It ain't worth it. I'm going to start blocking out, beginning now.

       Bean's memory    I did this for my first literary non-fiction assignment. I messed up bigtime, as it was supposed to be dwelling on a specific moment, and I didn't do that. I didn't even name it. It's just a great big failure, but I had way too much work to do, I was like 3529607205493 pages of reading behind last night so I had to do this earlier today... so...   Sporadic Sundays growing up were spent in the great wilderness. My grandparents lived in the rural city of Lakeville; my grandpa and a great number of his neighbors were farmers. Across the street stood an endless field of corn, which now would have an end. Growing up in the cornless city of Minneapolis, I could only explore uncharted territory on these Sundays of my youth.  During the daytime, we would play the country-folk games, because we were visitors  my cousins lived out there. I can remember best the efficient production of authentic country Mud Pies. Take some dirt clods, and mix with water, then add your own personal touch  to taste. Sometimes, when the lawn was justmowed, it would make an excellent vegetarian Mud Pie. For those of us who needed meat in our Mud Pies, we had to hunt for grasshopper. Across the street in the cornfield, we found a jungle of corny foliage, five times the size of us! It was filled with all kinds of wild beasts  ladybugs, caterpillars, moths, but none so elusive as the wily grasshopper.  Nobody would ever eat our pies, except for little Bob, who is maybe six years younger than me, and I am one of the youngest of the family. He would put anything in his mouth, and I dont think he has changed his ways as I am writing this, fifteen-plus years later. Maybe I fell for it once, and I blocked it out. Nobody wants to admit to eating mud, but everyone has done it. Its a rite of passage, and I would expect the older kids wouldnt let me play with them until I did.  Now that I think about it, grass probably doesnt taste so bad, and dirt  hey, its on the non-hydroponics vegetables we eat  but a grasshopper? I doubt anyone would tell me the truth if I asked today, Of course you ate a grasshopper, Scott! Dont you remember? Who would? Back then (I was under five at the time), all memories are happy. If not, it couldnt be classified as childhood, rather everything after. (Self-pity didnt exist for me until a short while later.) We took our craft seriously, we prankster chefs for the five-star restaurant in our heads. There were no toys, no balls, and no other fun to be had outside, so we would play as long as we had daylight, stopping only when the pirates came out after sunset.  The Pirates.  Up, up in the sky above the corn, three spooky ghost pirate ships set sail. Never fearing the moon, stars or clouds, they just passed through the sky, looking for kids who were out too late. We would run and hide as they made their way from one end of space to the other, and the older kids would tell the younger kids, The pirates are going to get you! I dont remember who told me the searchlights were pirate ships, or even if I believed them. I just know that back then, the truth was irrelevant, because the fantasy was fun.  Maybe once every month or so, my brothers and I would go with my mom to her parents house. We were forced to eat dinner in the basement, accompanied by the boxelder bugs, and we fought an awful lot. The adults fought just as much, or more, depending on how many Tom and Jerrys or Brandy-7s they drank. At the end of the day, we would drive silently home for a half hour, listening to Dr. Demento on the radio, and generally passing out two thirds of the way there. Anything bad was forgotten because life went on, and we were too busy to dwell, until much, much later.

      Dude what the hell. Like, blogsville is dead. Is it a January thing? Nobody is blogging, nobody is replying, I just don't know.  A few random points:  Early Mornings suck.  The Bucs are trash.  And here's the post I wanted to make but wouldn't. I'm gonna write it and go to bed, screw homework.   Self-Conscious   All my life I've heard the term "self-conscious" being used to describe a woman whose hips are getting too big, or someone with a pimple on their nose. Somehow, to the world around me and ultimately to me, the term "self-conscious" was a shameful adjective.  Growing up I was the biggest range of adjectives. So big, in fact, that I could never put my finger on it. Was I self conscious but with a high self esteem? No... I had a low self esteem, that must have meant I wasn't self conscious... it wasn't until recently that I finally gained a grasp of who I am, emotionally.  I am self conscious. That means I am self aware. That means I know what everyone else sees, and I think about how my actions affect others. I am conscientious(sp?), and considerate... when I do something that I wouldn't like if someone else did it, I stop. My life doesn't end at my own pleasure or convenience... ever. Is that not what it means to be self conscious?   I have always told people "Yeah, I'm fat and ugly." And people say "awww don't be so hard on yourself!" and I say... am I complaining? You freaking asked me and I answered. Nobody ever tried lying to me and saying I looked good, and I do not run and hide at the thought of being me. Being morbidly obese, I still spent four years at college before I started losing weight. I knew, but I also knew that if I let my appearance get me down, I'd just get worse and end up nothing. It was realism, not self pity.  BUT! Along with my self consciousness, came a low self-esteem. Esteem... sort of like respect. Can be taken to mean, regard, respect, value, whatever. My self worth was never very high. I put others' needs above my own -- my own happiness revolves around everyone else's happiness.  I don't like anything I ever do, and don't trust myself, not in the least. I don't think I'm the best anything, unfortunately -- however I do believe I am the best  something .  Best something. That is my ego talking. I have a fragile ego based on years as the youngest child, being told I can do anything, be anything. I've always been told how I am the most artistic and the smartest in the family. High expectations? Not really. I stopped listening to criticism when I realized how often it would come from my Dad. Criticism doesn't work on me. Guilt trips don't work on me. Logic works on me, and I am anal about many things, like logic, language, manners, and other matters of taste. I can be downright rude if you don't meet my standards. My standards aren't so high, they're just particular. I am a snob, despite my best efforts.  Unfortunately, I am easily shaken, if you know which buttons to push, and despite my best attempts to fill the gaps in my armor, my ego can still take significant blows. That's what happens when it's so big -- more surface area. Easier to damage. It's like a puffer fish. It's big for show, but it's just full of hot air. :( Or salt water, whatever you want to believe...  But this is all rambling besides the idea of self-consciousness. Why is that considered a bad thing? Everyone, it seems, around me at all times will sooner step on your toes than look down. They will pile yard upon yard of shit on top of something you're looking for. They will associate the first quarter of your story to the full length of theirs -- in excruciating detail. They will answer their cell phone in a study lab, or cut you off in traffic, or jay walk, or walk on red. They go to dinner knowing full well they can't afford it, so they let the waitress pay the difference, and leave her tipless. They are the reason I have to carry Josh in busy stores and streets. They are the reason the shy will never have their opinion heard -- there is no world outside of these people. They are not self conscious. They are self-contained. To be self conscious, is to see yourself and what you are doing. To be self contained means your head is up your own ass, and you can only smell roses.

       Not Bad...   I was just thinking about my life, and how for so long my life was horrible, and I was very unhappy, and horrible to be around. Nothing anybody did could change how I felt, and I was at rock bottom for years.  After I finally pulled myself out, after my hell was over, my life still was no good... I was still alone, still lonely, still hurting and sad. I was complacent with my place in life, because it could be worse. I was no longer on rock bottom, so I somehow thought it was okay to be justabout there.  Now here I am today. My life is better. I'm living healthier, my self image is better, I'm no longer constantly depressed, but I'm still alone, and I'm still lonely. I'm sitting here typing on the computer instead of going out and finding friends. I want friends I can show my website, so I can hide all my internet friends from them out of shame. (cough)  The sad thing is, that I always look outside myself first, and looking at other people I see things about myself in them, which makes me more aware of my own problems. I know too many people who will tell me, about their place in life (specifically relationships), "well it's better than it used to be," or "it could be worse." I know people who say "I can't do any better," as though they know. They, like me, are getting older, and losing their opportunities to live life to its full potential.   The sad thing is, most people are in this boat. If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with. Where is the happiness in that? Why won't we strive to be happy, for fear that we cannot reach it? For most, being alone is so unfathomable... so painful... that they will marry the first person to show interest in them.   I want to take this opportunity to threaten to kill Hollywood Romance movie makers, i.e. Nora Ephron, for their campy, fruity, unrealistic, idealistic movies that tell people how love happens, how true love finds a way, and how everyone is destined to find their soulmate whether they look or not. I've given up looking. I don't believe in soulmates or love at first sight. I can't believe in love at first sight, because nobody would fall in love with me at first sight; so if it exists, then I'm doomed! I think soulmates are just people with whom you're compatible. If you're normal, you have millions of soulmates. If you're odd, the closest thing you can find is someone with a similar heart. Heart and mind aren't soul. Did you just say I'm rambling?  All I want out of life is to see the people I love be happy. When that doesn't happen, I hurt inside because I want to change that. I want to make them happy. However, there's nothing I can do to help anyone who isn't happy, when it comes to love. People who are settling are too busy trying to convince themselves it's the right thing to do that anything you say will be taken as hostility. People who don't know anything better, well, they have to save themselves or they'll never be saved.  But I want to save them...  But I can't.  Is a heavy heart the reward you get for wanting everyone to be happy?   Do I close myself off, and become self-centered, to make myself happy? I am so worried about other people doing whatever it takes, maybe it's time I took my own advice. I don't see any alternatives. I've got a similar post I'll post later. One much less.......... specific.

       Pipe Dreams...   My brother, Jay, father of Josh and Sam, has always been a dreamer. His dreams are many: He wanted to be a skateboarder, of course; but most importantly he's always wanted to be an entrepreneur. He's suggested a strip club, and many different mechanic/service-related businesses. Recently, however, he told me his dream since he was a kid was to buy, maintain and live on a marina.  Well this came up at an opportune time, since in the next sentence he says to me "There's a marina for sale on the Saint Croix River. Dad says I should go for it. We could get it and all live there." I like the idea. The marina would mean, we would have a dock to stow boats (and make a good profit from that), and there would be food and lodging as well. If we played our cards right, the rednecks would come for the major warm-weather holidays and the money would roll in!  Problems lie, however, in the cost, and, well, the lack of an entreprenurial history for my family. It's a great dream, but we would need a lot of help starting it up. First of all, it's either one, or one point five million dollars to purchase, not including the money it would cost to get it ready to reopen, and to stock etc. We could stand to lose a lot of money like with all businesses, but if we were to stay afloat, that is easy living for all of us. It would be easy for many reasons: First of all, with whatever loan we take out, we could pay a good chunk of it back with my mom's house and Jay's house, and with some of Jay's equipment that he would sell, so he could only haul boulders for a big firm (for big money). Also, the family will be coming into a sum of money I won't discuss here because it's secret, but I think we could be OKAY in that department, depending on how long the plan is to last.  Anyway, there is a moral dilemma: Do I work to get this dream of Jay's fulfilled, thus leading me and mine to a life of general ease and security? If we go through with this, that leaves my brother John, who just graduated and is looking for a job, and me, working for family for life. That's a bad thing, right? I mean, we will never learn independence or "how to make it in the real world," if we get a job because of our relation... and don't have to worry about losing it, unless we lose the marina. Anyway, that's a problem.  But...  It would be so so so cool to be associated with this marina, it would be potential for many story-worthy experiences, and it would be so much easier than having to go out in the career world, if it was to work. I just need some confidence that it will work, and I need to pass that on to Jay, because while he has always been a lofty dreamer, reality always stares him in the face and keeps him from realizing any of his dreams. I would like to think this would make him happy finally, to live his dream... but none of us have stuck our necks out this far, so it is a lot to ask for all of us to do it... what do you think?

       Crutches   Originally posted five minutes ago on a message board by me.  I was just humming an old song to myself tonight, a song that I once called my "theme song," the song I used as the theme for my life at a certain point, and I listened to it often as a reminder of how my life was, and what happened that was so significant. All the decisions I made were to counteract my theme song, and led to a new theme song.  This got me to thinking: I don't have a theme song anymore! I have none! After all this time, music has just not been there for me; I haven't needed it. My theme songs in the past were all there for me to look to the past, to relive my past mistakes and dwell on them and never make any progress. Now, without a theme song, I am happier than I've ever been, and I am dropping my crutches like Forrest Gump when he started running.  My first crutch, as you all know, was food. I'd run and hide when my parents fought and would drink lots of milk, and much on slices of bologna or cheese. Yeah, real healthy. Anyway, I've always blamed food, always gone to food to cheer me up -- when my adrenaline pumps I always have an instinctive reaction to just grab some food... when I'm excited, or scared... I guess it stems back to the fights. Anyway, recently, I've had so many excuses about my appearance, and why it is as bad as it is. My excuses just made me more confident in my depressive state, and in a constant state of despair with regard to my weight. I mean jesus christ, I was over 300 lbs. How can you fix that? But then the due man saved the day. Told me, if I cared about how I looked, I'd change it. No ifs ands or buts, I'd change it and that's that. I stopped looking at food and started looking at me: At where I wanted to be, and how I wanted to get there. For once I looked forward. No theme song, no excuses.  Another major crutch I've been leaning on was this desire to fill the hole that is inside of me... my depression made me feel as though I needed someone else to complete me, to make me whole. I tried, and I tried, and I was always looking like a big fruitcake at school, just looking at the girls who were nice to me and wondering... why? Yeah. Real mature, right? So I didn't even consciously stop looking, it just happened. This has all happened at once. I snapped, in a way. All my crutches were thrown down and I can look forward, and all my depression problems, and what I thought was "seasonal affect" just aren't here. I am happy now, in the winter. Finals didn't stress me out.... much.... I have my puppy who is all the woman I need (shut UP you know I don't mean it like that), and as of last week, the scale said I'd lost at least 60 lbs. I'm not buying that it's 60 lbs just yet because it wasn't the Dr's office scale, but I am slimmer than I've been since I was like, 12, and feelin pretty good. The dog pissed in my shoes with the insoles in them, so my knees have been a little wonky, but other than that, I'm extremely happy. Life with no excuses truly is great. Okay, I admit life isn't so great, but if you could only get a glimpse of where I was 10 years ago, and 5 years ago, and then last April...  It was pathetic. The worst part was, I didn't handle it well. I'm handling life well now.  It's 4 am and I am really, really incoherent so what was supposed to be an intelligent post may just come out as a bunch of jumbled words, but I hope I get my point across. If your life isn't so great, or you're not so happy, and you have an excuse for it... stop. Excuses are crutches. Anything to make you look to the past is unhealthy. Pick a future and stay focused there. Every day you are closer to reaching your goal, is like Christmas. I do so love the new Bean.

       Trying AGAIN   Libby's punk ass sent me a link and when I clicked on it, my half-written (okay not quite half) blogger window disappeared, in place of an IMDB window. Bastard AIM needs to open links in a new window.  Anyway, I took Tara to the Vet Tuesday. She has worms and is medicating, I just have to really clean up after her. It cost 75 bucks for the basic, so now I can keep going, or I can do the 100 bucks and 20 a month for full doggy coverage, but then I need a job. That, plus food, is harshness.  Anyway, I still love her, thought I might have had to give her away but nooooooooooooooooooooooo... after the vet's I got her some squeek toys and a hard chew toy, the vet told me to get her one cause she's still teething, and also to yip when she bites? O_o Well, I also got her a new collar and a tag. It reads "TARA: (myphone#underneath)" It cost 8 bucks for the gold one, at a vending machine in petsmart, and I put it on her black leather collar with studs and spikes. Yeah, she's an S&M bitch now. Yeah boy.      Let's see.   Aside from Tara, I was at the doctor's the other day, and since I went there in October, I've lost another 20 pounds, bringing the total to 60 pounds I've lost. However, I had a bad new years, and will have my work cut out for me to keep losing.  Last night we picked up some famous dave's BBQ for dinner, and my brother and cousin cleaned out the liquor cabinet finding things for me to drink. I've been dry since late July, so my tolerance isn't what it used to be. I had a drink at the Tom Petty/Jackson Browne concert, and a few christmas eve (I needed them...), but that's it. Yup. Oh, and one drink two months ago :P  So now I feel kinda icky from all the mixed drinks and all the food, and I think because my body isn't used to all that sick shit anymore. *shakes head* I think it's a good sign that I feel really bad that I had all that. A sign I'm a new Bean :)  Speaking of which, I'm still looking into that whole new experiences thing, since when I graduate I will want to start seeing the world a little better, to get a grasp of the interesting shit I can find. My brother has suggested he might buy a marina on a riverfront which would be an experience, with all the drunk rednecks and such, it would definitely be great to see, if it ever happened.  Speaking of pipe dreams, my brother who wants the marina, also asked me to find info on free parenting classes, and free help for mothers who just... aren't very good at it. Does anybody out there have any websites or pointers for that? It would be greatly appreciated. My sister in law needs all the help she can get.  Other than that, how are you all doing? I still have to find Kate's box and... I mean the box Kate's care package came in, and send out the super late christmas card to her ;) I also owe Wendi lots of stuff when I get around to it. I don't owe anybody else anything at all though because nobody ever asks anything of me :(  Bye...

Tell me, can anyone figure out what's going on in today's journal entry? It seems the crazy lady has a Doctor... and she always looks at Doctors as potential husbands... and she talks about the Doctor himself, and the Doctor's voice... is it possible to have schizophrenia and have one of the voices in your head be a real person? I have no idea how it works, but uh... yeah. I don't know, it's getting sad.

      LET THE JOURNAL OF JULIANNA BEGIN.  Title page (with all the statistics and miscellaneous information).  Top:  God bless U.S. Naval Intelligence.  Side: Julianna (middle name) Willis (insert SSN here)  1  Sept. 2, 1992 - Wednesday  It's 3:23 p.m. I dont know where Gail is, Mrs. Gail Kove(?). Ive been sitting here at Peters Grill ever since a few minutes to 3:00 p.m., when she and I were supposed to meet here. I recall wondering if I should phone and remind her of our get-together before I saw my psychiatrist this morning. I decided not to, and I see it was a mistake. I dont have time to waste, and Im sure she doesnt either. I wonder what the problem is. Its expensive here, but Id better order something and spend a good long time waiting for her. Im hungry anyway. Its 3:25 p.m. I suppose Ill leave around 4:00 p.m. if my waitress hasnt asked me what I want to order, or should I wait until 4:30 p.m.? Its 3:40 p.m. Ive ordered. Ill stay as long as seems appropriate.  2  Mrs. Kuves voice sounds like shes my worst enemy, or his disciple. I consider Mark Forester my worst enemy and my daughters worst enemy. I see Mark as a worse enemy to democracy than any other person I know. He seems to do what he does because he has a grudge against me, but there may be deeper reasons why he does what he does. I wouldnt trust him with a nuclear push button. I dont consider Byron as dangerous to democracy as Mark, but then I havent seen Byron as someone in law enforcement might see him.

Lemme know if you want them.      God says I maybe shouldnt go to All Saints next Sunday or settle there. Ill write a note to the priest and explain in safe terms, so shell know I cant make it. (God says it wasnt He who said this. I wonder who advises this.)  (the following is bracketed with one of these: { )  1)Live a godly week. 2) Have a godly Sabbath. 3) Try fasting at 5 meal-times, 3F, 1, 2, &3 Sat, 1 Sun. 4) Do exercises Sun. (Today) through Fri.  (this was also bracketed)  5)Walk when you can face it maybe walk 2 hours with your HHA if weather permits.  (left of #6 says Work on this. ?)  6) If God says you may and it creates no risk for others who use a pool, go swimming with your HHA, Alternative is treadmill for walking.  (back of paper)  If you dont go all the time to All Saints, excuse yourself properly and take an interest in Indian people in general, going now and then to the Mpls. Am. Indian Center.

      Yeah, yeah, I'm almost 23... what was I doing sledding yesterday?  It's so obvious, I don't have to tell you why I went, or with whom. I'll just cut right to the chase.  Last week we went. Sam wanted to go in her sled with me... surprising, that I even fit in a sled at all, but with a kid in there as well, well... that's always nice.  I had my dress pants on. I hadn't entirely planned on going sledding. They are a thin material and very baggy -- most baggy at the bottom, where my ankles are almost bony. Anyway, my legs, as long as they are, had to hang off the end of the small child's sled, and as we went down, the wind blew up and inflated my pant legs, filling them with ice-cold air and snow. It was amazing.  Don't get me wrong, I HATE sledding. I can't stand anything that raises my blood pressure. I feel... exhilirated and disgusted at the same time. It's just hard on me. So I rarely sled. I went once the first time, once the second time. Whenever I go to Valleyfair (like a ghetto Six Flags), I will ride the flume once, and only once, and that will be it, FOR THE YEAR. I'm a pussy.  The kids were lined up at the only remaining patch of clean snow. The rest of the hill had been stripped clean of all the weekend snow by the early-morning kids of that morning, and the morning before. A bunch of older kids, 11ish, some not wearing coats (what the hell?) were racing... roughly. They would fight, knock each other down, pile up on sleds... very dangerous. It wasn't good to see, with Josh and Sam there. But the kids got their sledding in, but since they don't really get out much, they didn't have the endurance to walk up the hill as much as they wanted, so we were cut kind of short. New to the sledding scene, both would start walking up the track and we would have to yell "JOSH! SAM! GET OUT OF THE WAY! GO OVER HERE!" and it took them FOREVER. It was quite scary, but no harm done.  There was a scary moment, however... Sam was going down, and she plowed right into Josh, knocking him over. She clipped his shin. My heart stopped. However, his grandma just bought him new boots, and he's a tough little bugger, so he got up and was AOK. Whew.  Along with the sled and the snow tube, we brought Josh's snow skate, that I bought him for his birthday in November. It's basically a snowboard without footholds... or a skateboard without wheels. Anyway, there was a shallow hill before the walkway before the steep hill, and I offered to take Josh boarding down that hill. Well, Josh is five. Josh can't exactly snowboard, so he gave me one of his hands and I had to run down behind him, holding him up while he boarded down the hill. Oh, did he ever love that. Yeah, apparently my legs didnt. From the trips up the hills we made, and from running down the hill, and all this in my NON-supportive boots, and without a knee brace... well my legs are screaming at me today. And this was my big walking day, with my full backpack. Torture, man.  My brother John made it down the hill on the snowskate... said it freaked him out; too fast. My turn came, and I went about a foot and stopped. Uh uh. No fucking way, man. That's not me. I don't want to die on a snowy hill, okay?  I'll leave the fun to the kids. I caught some video of it... so with any luck, I'll be able to convert it to computer video... but that may not be for a while.  Yall take care. Do you like the letters from the crazy lady? I know I'm going to hell for posting them... but what good would they be if I couldn't share with the world? I got offered money for everything tonight... it's amazing. Some pictures, some poetry, a couple book reports, letters to a psychologist, letters to her daughter, love letters to her obsession, an envelope containing evidence that the government was plotting against her... a newsletter to all her "people" about how her life is going... and most wonderful of all, one full notebook full of journal entries, and a few other notebooks with about a week's worth of journal entries. You guys better keep up, AlphaBean.net won't be boring for quite some time...

      The following things were photocopied and stapled together, I dont know why.  Page 1:  Dear Marion,  	Because of the many good things you do for your little family, good things I have observed, may you have a happy Mothers Day. Being a mother is at the same a humble calling and one of the most significant things a woman can do. It is a worthy calling. Love, Julie  Page 2:  (at the top) If you are innocent, you owe it to me to make it clear. 	(address included here) 	May 9, 1997  Dear Martin, 	My hallucinations indicate you have a desire to kill 3 people who are dear to me. They claim you believe I support your breaking Gods commandment: Thous shalt not kill. But this is untrue. I pray (arrow points to the right margine) In Jesus Name, I pray, for both you and Marion, who has threatened to kill Mother, (return to body of letter) that you will righteously follow, with immaculate obedience, not only the Ten Commandments of Exodus and the desires of God expressed in Leviticus, where he forbids many things including incest, but(?) Jesus Two Great Commandments From the New Testament. It may not be necessary that I ask you to follow these statutes and commandments of God, you perhaps would see it as unthinkable to violate any of them, but in my hallucinations, you insist on raping me, you envy what I am and what I have and whom I hold dear, and your voice threatens to kill my dear ones.  Love, and admonition,   Julie  (On the left margin)  P.S. It isnt some of you (added: or others) to believe I would support your doing anything ungodly or breaking any commandment of Gods.  (On the right margin, at the bottom)  I will photocopy this and share it with my home health aide and maybe with Mother or a minister.

      Confessions Of A Crazy Lady: Part 1  The names have been changed to protect the innocent(me). Irene is the daughter, and from here on, I will be naming the mother "Julianna."   -1-  Over the last 18 years, I have been hospitalized 10 times, ostensibly for paranoid schizophrenia. That it hasnt been more often may be hopeful. I tend to feel my problem is chemical because I know I wouldnt bring it on myself.  My last hospitalization began October 17, 1982, and ended January 6, 1983, so its been 14 months since I was discharged, and 13 months since Irene came home. I am now taking 10 milligrams proleyxien(?) and 2 milligrams cogertin(?). I like the proleyxin(?). It has helped tremendously. And although I dream of being off medication, staying on even just a low dosage may be the real way to make my Dreams for my life come true.  -2-  My problem began when I was in my junior year of college. I was at Princeton University that year. Maybe it was more than I could handle. My parents had worried that it would be, and they didnt want to see me hurt. I started hearing voices my second semester at Princeton. When finals came, I was unprepared. I went to the infirmary instead of to my exams. My grades were estimated after one class was dropped, and on arriving home I was evaluated to be acutely schizophrenic. Since then the schizophrenia has become a chronic problem and has been diagnosed as paranoid type.  -3-  Irene had some trouble adjusting to 4th grade at Wilder (?) Elementary, and I believe it was that she picked up some of my depression. Her teacher prodded her and I helped her with her work, and by now her teacher has lots of good things to say about Irene, including a compliment for all the reading Irene does outside her schoolwork.  Now whenever Irene brings work home I help her with it. Now she brings it home instead of letting it pile up at school. I have always gotten compliments on Irene and for the way Ive raised her.  -4-  My mother has said, since my last hospital trip, that perhaps now Im well enough that I wont have to go back.  My high school French teacher, who lit prayer candles for me whenever I was in the hospital, said we all have to suffer some it seems. She said maybe I had had my share of suffering by now, and that maybe I wouldnt have to suffer anymore. Maybe I wouldnt have to go back to the hospital any more.  Howie Williams, a friend of 28 years, says Im sounding better now than I ever did.   -5-  I have a fine young physician whom I see every two weeks for about 15 minutes. He is intelligent, (?), and has an easygoing optimism. He knows how very much I love Irene, and that I dont ever want to be parted from her unless it be a normal thing concurrent with her growth.  Most of my sharing with Irene is spontaneous. Shell say lets do thus and so, and if I can work it out, we do it. I enjoy pleasing her, but I wonder if we shouldnt have a weekly schedule so shed know what to expect.

        COMING SOON!    My brother found a dumpster full of old journals and letters of a crazy woman who went to school at Princeton. He saved quite a few journals and a pile of letters for me. My plan is to post the contents of those letters online under assumed names (to avoid legal trouble), and let you guys (if anyone still reads) follow the trials and tribulations of a real live crazy woman over the past 30 years.  Does it sound too evil of me? Will anyone read if I do it? Will you hate me forever and call the cops? Whatever the case, if one person is interested, I will do it. Gawrsh, I'm evil. :)

      Hi.  Birthday's over. I'm kinda sleepy. I need some Gatorade.... _  So the good: I finally got to go out last night at about 10, to the local VFW with all the drunken redneck veterans. I made an astute drunken observation that the VFW must be government subsidized with how fucking strong their drinks are. I mean... they pour, right, and the nozzles all leak, so every mixed drink you get is pretty much, well, not mixed very well... :X but that rules indeed. I was quite well after like 5 drinks.  As for the night before, I had three long islands at  urlLink BW3 , and then I had three jack and cokes, a three wise men and two undercurrents at the next two bars. I was rather unruly and making an ass of myself by the end of the night, then everyone wanted to leave and I was all sad. PS: Chambord is an awesome, awesome drink.  I got no play though :( Even though I looked sexy in my new leather jacket!!! I also got a DVD stereo system from John and an Optimus Prime toy from Josh, and then some money and stuff.  So anyway, you know how you haven't had a good time unless you get hurt, right? I was running away from someone who was going to throw a snowball at me, and when I took a sharp turn, my low-top boot which was untied :( rolled and my ankle went with it, so I went down... right knee, left elbow, fell and got right back up because I rule. But it hurts. It hurt even worse when I put a bandaid on it (because scrapes against pants = horrible). Because when I removed the bandaid, it reminded me that I have hairy knees. Yup.  So last night I went out with my dad, and I got to see him dance with his girlfriend. Ha! And the night before I got the Otis Redding/Jimi Hendrix at Monterey festival record which is awesome.  Ummmmmmmmmmm There's more. Maybe I'll edit later.  Until then, chow. It's so nice out there is basketball to be played. And since it's Sunday, maybe I'll challenge Jesus to a game of HORSE.     Yeah, I didn't get that either.

      My shitty semester thus far.  One of my classes, well, the professor has been teaching for about 50 years, and he's grown senile. He rambles on endless tangents about how things in his life relate to a story, but nothing he says is on the tests or quizzes or in papers. However, when people stopped coming, he got pissed and threw a pop quiz. Well, it's in the morning so I'm tired, I can't think fast enough so I don't turn the quiz in, because he snaps through them. I'm not very good at thinking on the spot. That brings me to my next class... but I gotta finish with this one, first.  My TA doesn't speak very good English. She knows English well, for she's a Literature TA. However, she speaks slowly and methodically, and she only knows the letter of the language, therefore is entirely rigid in her criticism. She grades everything with a checklist and is very strict and anal, with no leeway at all.   Not only that, but she's... well, she's not very aware. For one, she had two papers assigned on the same day. For two, on Monday I got to class way late because of traffic, so I I left my paper in her mailbox since i didn't want to go into class with 5 minutes left... so she sent an email TODAY saying that the paper was due THURSDAY, because on MONDAY we had classmates look at it, but she didn't say anything! I left a note on my draft and left it at that, thinking that she would contact me if there was anything I should know -- my excuse was on the paper, the paper was turned in, what more was there? But there was more, but she said nothing of the sort, and now I'm potentially fucked.  I really don't like that class, not at all. Nor do I like my other class...  My Brit Lit class, first of all, the readings are so horribly dense my attention span won't allow me to finish any of them. They're these horrible Victorian British essays about random shit and they make my eyes bleed --they're all one paragraph! But that's not the worst part.  One worst part: The professor saw me with my feet up, as the desktops in the auditorium are set up for righhanders and I'm a lefty, I have to sit awkwardly which is shit on my bad back, so I sit in the middle and put my feet up. He didn't appreciate it and called on me in the big class twice in one class. I can't handle being put on the spot, as I said before, and I froze up. Embarassed myself completely. Twice. It was horrible. Bean = not very confident in public social situations. :p   Speaking of social situations, another social situation problem. I don't know ANYTHING about college ettiquette(sp). A girl I had a class with last semester, at the beginning of this class, waved me over to sit by her. We sat and talked until class started, but then gradually a guy who was in the class with us but who never liked me starts talking to the girl more and more, and since he's forceful and rude, and I am not... I get left holding my [expletive] in my hand, while he interrupts me. So I was gone one day with a bad back (I took a muscle relaxer, slept all day), and when I came back he was sitting where I had been sitting... and they're talking the whole time. After about 5-10 minutes, she says hi, asks what's up, and then he interrupts me and they start talking again... so...  Today I hear em talking, he had interrupted me again, only this time interrupted me to talk to the girl about a study group for the class. They were talking about it, then invited a girl next to the guy to the study group... and I'm just sitting there like... o_O? Is this a hint? Am I being snubbed here?  Yall are college age or above, on average, what would you say? I got dissed like this all through grade school, jr. high and high school. I've had like... zero social experiences in college thus far, and then there's this. What do I do? I could confront her, which would seem lame, as it's always a case of me "blowing something out of proportion," or I could just blow her off completely, or I could make an excuse not to sit by her... but those two seem petty on my part... or I could just sit there and take it, which aint' my style. I would love to know what I did, or if maybe the problem is on my end, if I'm coming across as a dick or whatever, but I hate being here. I'm always here.  Why can't the Bean catch a break? :(  Spring Break won't be much of a break... like 4 tests/papers the day after. Zuh? This is like, by far the worst semester I've ever had.

      Drama!  A couple weeks ago I was in a car accident, and I was like "ach, my neck is tense, I must have jarred it."  Last night I felt on my neck and realized I had a bulge on my spine.  Tomorrow I'm gonna go make an appointment to see a doctor about it. Does someone have experience with this shit? Can someone give me some encouraging words?   Also, I got an email saying I completely fucked up my application to get into a fiction writing workshop. I was embarassed as hell, because I thought I followed the directions but apparently the directions were for a graduate student level course... though I could have sworn I was OK. There was nothing online about the class so I just pieced together what I could find and that wasn't good enough.  That hurt.  I had a paper due this morning so I was up all night working on it, and I dod horribly because I was so stressed over the application. Not about my neck... I am still waiting to find out what is wrong before I start letting that upset me.  Anyway, there's a house on the market my dad's been pushing John and I to buy. Recently, our brother Jay was put into the mix, and Jay told me why it's a bad idea, so I told him whatever he felt was the right decision I would listen to. Then my dad called yesterday and asked what I thought. I said I wasn't sure what to think because I hear so many different things, and because it would cost so much money I didn't know if I could handle it or not. He said to make a decision and that he would call back tomorrow (today).  I got back from school today around 4 and I hear he's gone ahead and signed for the house. He's going to make Jay move in and John and I are not involved at all. Now, that's fine. We probably aren't responsible enough to handle it anyway... but Dad hasn't talked to me at all today. I'm finding this shit out from Jay and our mom. I don't understand what the deal with him being such a pussy is. If he actually could hurt me I would be hurt, but instead I am just pissed.  And when I'm pissed, I'm not fun to be around. I sure hope he doesn't try talking to me for a long, long time.  Maybe I'll just give him a copy of my story. Aw yeah. (see: Mysterious Ways, I posted it a few weeks back...)  So let's see... any more drama? Well there is more drama but I can't discuss that here.  That's fine, I'm not down or anything, I just find it an interesting chain of events, you know? I'm being tested. And since I believe in nothing, I'm being tested at random and that's pretty lame, dude.

      So last night... rather this morning I posted my first in a while. I suppose that makes it obvious that I've not been too interested. Other people weren't interested and my interest waned. It grew increasingly harder to comment and even read some blogs so I just gave up for a bit.   That's okay though, I've had lots of school shit to take care of, and a puppy to love (we just got back, she took me for a walk.), so while I would consider my recent spell "apathy," maybe it was just apathy for certain things. As my mental state increases, my patience decreases. I've gone allow on AIM and stopped blogging because there was too much getting me down and you know, I used to say "happiness at all costs," but it wasn't until recently I started living it.  I thank youse for sticking with me, and eventually I will come to terms with my apathy... it's a new feeling, I need to regulate it. Everything about me is changing and it's tough. I went through a time where my posture changed and my back was cramping and spasming and it was a son of a bitch. Then I got more mobility in my hips and neck and shoulders, so that all hurts now too. I can hold my head up high again. That's cool.  I dunno, I'm still not too interested in blogging but a couple of my oldschool homies commented so I figured I would give a shout out. This is no drama, this is just me trying to learn how to deal with drama. I'll be back soon. Maybe I'll just get bored this summer :)

It's Tuesday night, and I'm about to go to bed.  But first, I have to do my rehab, but first. I'm gonna say hi.  Finals are done. I half-assed all of them because I was depressed because of my shoulder. Six weeks with no basketball. I have to do all kinds of stretches and exercises every day multiple times a day, ice it and take 800 mg of ibuprofen.  What they say is I have impingement tendonitis. It's from basketball (and over the years), just overexerting and not having enough muscle in the rotator cuff. So... there you go. No basketball. That's killing me, you have no idea.   So I have been taking Tara for long walks, but it's been raining and cold lately, I could hardly move... plus the whole pain thing.  So hi, how are you? My name is great big whiner.   I missed Buffy's finale, but it's taped so I watch it tomorrow.  MSN/Qwest screwed up the DSL so John can't get on. Getting fixed tomorrow.  I'm down to 215 lbs, now, technically, according to my ID, that's 105 lbs, but I THINK I was around 335+ at one point, which would mean 120+... eh, I wish I weighed myself more back then.  Going back to the Dr. Thursday...  Need to take Tara for training...  Gotta get my license (no, I don't have it nor do I want one. MN Drivers are horrid. I don't want to die).  Any other news? Nope.  Peace out.

       Swallowed: Cheating.   It was never my intention to write anything that would come across as some sort of dieting self help book. I didnt want to say this is what I did and it will work for you, too! However some things in our lives happen that we must share. There are some secrets that just cannot remain hidden. If you have been on a diet before, I am sure you have heard the term cheat day being used. That is to say, once a month or once a week, or once a whenever, you are allowed to eat whatever you want, as long as you stick to your diet. If you maintain this schedule, and maintain it well, I guarantee you will see results. But enough about you, lets talk about me.  	Without a cheat day, I wouldnt have lost twenty pounds, tops. I would have been the same ball of fat I always was, because honestly, I couldnt eat what I was supposed to eat. Sandwiches without mayo? Anything without cheese? Please. Life looked bleak when I decided to change my life (I almost said when I started my diet, but I keep reminding myself, this is no diet). The first day I started eating right was when I went to the Minnesota state fair. If youve ever been to a state fair (yes, you will spend a lot of time in my shoes in this chapter), you would know that you cant exactly diet there. I always wanted to try a deep fried pickle and deep fried macaroni and cheese on a stick and deep fried alligator. But I had made the decision and I would stick to it. I spent an entire day walking in circles, and all I had to eat was an ear of corn. I drank a little iced tea, but it happened to be sour or rotten, so I was left with my ear of corn. Some people were impressed, others were afraid. I didnt eat anything? That cant be healthy; but I was gung-ho.  	The first week I did a lot of starving myself. I felt that to keep under my allotted 1500 calories, I couldnt eat much of anything. I would do some work, and this was August were talking, but the heat was too much and I would get woozy. I would have to eat something, and gain my strength. It took me a while to learn moderation. Even after I learned it, I only practiced it loosely. I only ate the bare minimum as my way of saving up for the proverbial pie in the sky. You know, if you live right on earth you get to achieve eternal bliss in heaven? The cheat day is kind of like that. You eat your high fiber cereal in the morning followed by lots of vegetables and fish, turkey and chicken later on, you deserve a reward. Friday comes, and its like youve been being good all winter, and Christmas happens once a week: You get to indulge in your weakness.  	For me it was Mexican food. I cannot live without burritos. Unfortunately, tortillas are extremely high calorie and are made with lard. They are usually filled with cheese, sour cream and guacamole, in addition to the meat filling. Burritos are bad, hence the cheat day. Chipotle burritos. If you have ever had a Chipotle, you understand the addiction. If you missed it, that was the third time I did that. Anyway, as long as I ate bad, bad food throughout the day, I rewarded myself with a nice big burrito on Friday. I didnt exactly get what I used to get, mind you; I needed enough to satisfy me, not to gorge me. Gorging is a thing of the past. I am, and was, above it.  	No sour cream, no cheese, no meat. At first, only the tortilla, black beans, rice, veggies and guacamole. Later on, I replaced the tortilla with meat. When you do the math, the calorie trade-off is pretty similar. The important thing was the flavor. Two servings of hot salsa instead of one, that was key. Without hot sauce, the current me would not exist. Hot sauce: zero calories, and can make even the blandest steamed veggies palatable. Somebody should bottle it and sell it, they could make a fortune.  	To have a cheat day, it is a reward for a long week of eating well. Ive already alluded to that. However, thats not the only benefit of the cheat day. When I was at my biggest, I used to just wait for the next meal. I basically lived for the next meal. At night, I anticipated breakfast; at breakfast I anticipated lunch, and so on. From day to day, I anticipated when I could have the next burrito, or fried chicken with pepper jack, mayo, bacon, fried bred melt sandwich! The world is full of so many flavors, and we dont have long to live. We have to live for the moment. We need to appreciate each meal as it comes, or we could miss out!  	However, my meals seemed to coincide quite a bit. What that means is, I didnt exactly get a lot of variety. When you eat the same heart-clogging thing three or more times a week, the days seem to all melt into one. Every single day I went without my beloved spicy pork burrito seemed like an eternity. To lose 140 pounds or more would take far too long I counted in days. Before I decided to change my life, I always counted in days. Where would I be tomorrow? Shit, where would I be in a few hours when it was lunchtime? But then I started living for the cheat day. Friday became the focal point of my life. Where would I be on Friday? Where would I go to eat? Friday would be my special day to eat whatever I want. Friday would be great. When I started living for Fridays, the weeks started to float by like days. Four weeks in a month turned into four days in a month. Four Fridays. It is that simple. When you live for your next meal, if you only eat  I mean truly eat four times in a month, you are set. I was set. Before I knew it, here I am. The time flew by. As smart as I like to think I am, it wasnt hard at all to trick myself. The part of me that loves food is not rational like the rest of me; it is easy to trick.  	The worst thing about eating the same thing several times a week, is that it all blends together. What that means is, if someone came up to me and asked when was the last time you had a burrito? I wouldnt be completely sure. After all, I had eaten the exact same thing several times in a week. How could I possibly differentiate? Its difficult to remember your meals from one day to the next; that is why you are supposed to keep a journal when you diet. I dont do journals, so I thought, fuck that. Instead, I employed the trusty cheat day. How hard is it to remember one day a week? Not just any day, but the one day you spent six days waiting for! Imagine having one cheat day a year, if you could afford it. The significance would be greater. However, I, nor anyone else for that matter could live off one cheat day a year; thats insane. One week it was one glorious week of eating whatever the hell I wanted (in moderation) followed by six more days of healthy living.  	It was towards the end of last August that it all began. The great big coup. The existence-defining moment. I used to merely exist. I was an afterthought. I would be the one who would tag along with my mom, or my dad, or one of my brothers to an event. Nobody ever came to see me, because they had seen me, and once is enough with a three hundred and forty pounder. When anyone asked about me, it was just yeah thats Scott. Uh yeah. Sometimes they said I wanted to be a writer, or that I was funny. I spent a lot of time on the computer, so I was pretty good with computers. I was at the University of Minnesota. That was who I was. That was everything anyone needed to know about me. I did not have an identity defining moment until the state fair. It became who I was. It was the unattainable goal I set for myself that everyone wanted to see me reach. Each time I lost a significant amount of weight, it became an even bigger deal. Everyone I knew was at a loss for words to use to describe me  to compliment me. They were not the only ones at a loss for words.  	Here I am, a month away from the one year anniversary. Maybe I will lose another 20 pounds this month, or maybe Ill stay where I am. At the end of the day, I lost over 10 pounds a month over the past year, maybe more. Of course, at my biggest, I feared the scale; now I embrace it. The little weight hovering over the 150 is now my identity. Before I went all the way to the end. Now I am under 200 pounds. It has been 11 months and they have flown by so fast you would not believe. When I had lost 40 pounds, it was a landmark. When I had lost 60 pounds it was amazing. At 80 it was unbelievable, and at 90, people talked as though I had reached my goal. One hundred pounds was my goal. 100 Is such a nice number, isnt it? But it was never really where I wanted to be. 20 pounds, 200 pounds, the numbers never mattered to me. All the numbers represent is a defining characteristic. I am the guy who lost over 135 pounds. I am that guy. Im not the guy who lost a ton of weight, who is that guy? Im the guy who lost an entire person. I am the guy who used to be really really really really really really big. I am the guy nobody recognizes. Im the guy people mistake for my brother. Im the guy who is just one of the guys. I am the guy who can be called skinny, despite my considerable belly and love handles. I am the guy people whisper about in a good way. The used to whisper to spare my feelings. Now they whisper because they are proud, and I like to pretend like I am humble.

      Well yall, http://www.alphabean.net/diet/ was updated like a week ago, and I've lost since then. I'm officially around 200 pounds. That is, if you're keeping score, 135 pounds at least I have lost. I rulz.  Went to the doctor for a while today, going for more therapy next Friday on my shoulder. I should be better in a few YEARS. :(  Tara's been in class and she's doing okay. A little slow, but she's ahead of her classmates. She's also calmed down a lot, and is awesome and the best dog ever. She saw a german shepherd/husky mix last night, freaky as hell. The dog's owner was like OMG she has blue eyes too! And we had a special bonding moment. Non-huskies with blue eyes kick ass.  School for 3 hours a day, and I totally played playstation instead of going to my first class. My bad.  Anyway, gotta get ready for class n shit, nice talking to ya. Reply if you feel so inclined.  *taps the microphone*  Is anyone still out there?

      Swallowed  Caught Slipping. By Scott Wenker  I put on a brave face and a smile. I aim to be happy and dont let anything get me down. I am a rock for others, and I try my best to keep a smile on my face. I like to keep busy, playing a video game, or going out and doing things to keep my mind occupied. It sounds great, doesnt it? When I come home, I head straight to the fridge. I might just make a stop or two along the way. Maybe there is some fruit left in the fruit basket. If not, there is bread on the counter. If nothing else, there is a jar of peanut butter that keeps getting emptier and emptier.  The hunger has returned, and I cant stop it. I make excuses, of course. The scale last week said I weighed 194, which is four pounds shy of me having lost 150 for the year. I went to the state fair on the anniversary, and I ate what I wanted because I was rewarding myself. It was a reward! Well, if its there I might as well eat it I mean, one more thing cant hurt. I can snack, its okay. Im not obese anymore, so I dont have to be so careful.  It has been almost a week since my dog ran away. Somebody left her outside early in the morning. When I came down later, she had dug her way under the fence and ran away. I stood there in the doorway with her tag in my hand and cursed. I cursed at the person who left her outside, and I cursed at myself for not being up to watch her. I also laughed at my luck: The night before, my dog, Tara and I fought long and hard. I wanted to put the tag on her, but she attacked me fiercely. She clawed and she bit, and she did everything in her power to keep me from putting that tag on. I gave up for the night and would put it off until the morning. The chance never came.  Three weeks before, Tara returned to me. She had escaped four days earlier, and was found almost immediately by a woman who gave Tara to her sister. The lady who now possessed Tara filed a report with the Pound, letting them know she had my dog. I finally got ahold of her and I got Tara back. She was back for a few weeks and things were good. I was treating her better, taking her for walks, and trying to make up for not being there for her.   The entire time Tara was gone that first time, I was unbearable to be around. I had never experienced a feeling like what I felt then. I wanted to blame everyone but myself, because I knew I was at fault. I was the last one through the gate, and while I could have sworn I locked the gate, it was wide open when I returned home. Everyone wanted to punch me those three days she was gone. It was nearly impossible for me to be civil. I had no patience for anyone. Finding Tara was the priority. As such, my relationships suffered. People started to hate me. My frustrations were not appreciated. I may have lost my dog, but that did not give me the right to be short with others. After plenty of introspection, I decided that it was in my best interest to let things slide. Just put up a front, and be optimistic for Taras sake.  That brings me to the past week. I was infinitely more bearable this time around, despite my beloved dog having run away again. Perhaps I was used to having lost her, which explains the increase in mood. However, it does not explain the increase in consumption. So last night I was preparing for bed when I started thinking about how bad I had been eating recently, and how, at dinner, my brother pointed out that I was being a lot nicer this time. I wondered why, and remembered my original essay, in which I had discussed my childhood rage, and how when it hurt others I swallowed it. Swallowing that rage caused me to feel so empty that I had to fill that hole. I had slipped back into the hole  again.  Only this time it was different. This time, it was acceptable. My family was actually relieved that I was eating worse. Over the past year, I have become quite strict in what I eat, and what I let others eat. This behavior was unwelcome by all, though they understood why I had to do it. I had to go all-out for the weight loss to work, and it did. But whenever I slip, my family is okay with it, and they say nothing to me. They say nothing, because I have reached a point where I am still chubby, yet I am not immobile, or painfully obese. Maybe they dont want me to be completely fit, or just think I am good enough. Compared to twelve months ago, Im Olympian.  Now, more than ever I need help. I conquered the depression that had plagued me most of my life, but that doesnt mean I cant be depressed. I miss my girl, but I am too sad to go after her. I dont even know where to start. I am helpless and desperate. I go out to the kitchen because thats where she used to stay. I open the back door, call out to her, hoping she will be sitting on the steps at my feet. Hoping she would come in and lick my ankles. I close the door in defeat, and open the refrigerator door thats next to the back door. While Im out here, I say to myself, Might as well  I dont know if Tara will ever return. I dont know what I will do if she doesnt. Im not sure what I will do if she does, either. The first time I knew it was a fluke, and I would have to be extra careful to stop her from leaving  The second time proved that her leaving was more than a fluke. I do not know how to stop her. Shes smart. If she wants to leave, she will. I get ahead of myself, my head swimming in guilt. Its my fault she got away. Im not worthy to own a dog. I have these thoughts whenever I think about her. They will subside in time, sure, but how long will I have to wait? What if I finally move on and she comes back? And then leaves again?   And what can I do about all of the things that I am feeling? I want to lash out. I want to find someone to blame other than myself. I want my dog back. I want it to be easy. I dont want to hurt anybody. I want to sleep, shrink away from the world and eat in privacy. Two burritos, a pizza, a nice, big Scooby Doo sandwich maybe a box of something or a bag of something. It wont be so bad if its just snack food. Or maybe lots of fruit. Just leave me alone with my food and my pain.  I dont want to get out of the hole this time. I have reached a crossroads: I can lash out, or I can be nice and eat. But there is the third option. The light in the distance. The place Ive never been to before. The place where I can be sad without taking it out on other people, and I dont have to bottle things up. The pain is there and it will not go away if I ignore it, and it will not go away if I drag someone else into it. It will go away in time, and in that time it is up to me to be strong. Its something Ive never done before. Newsflash  I am surprised too  The last year had nothing to do with strength.  All my life I was in pain and I embraced it. I swallowed it and when I wasnt lashing out, I was eating. When I let everything go  when I stopped lashing out and I stopped eating like I had been eating, it was me letting go of the pain. I did not deal with it. I did not face my demons. I merely ran away. I hid. I wrote a bunch of essays and told everyone how I had conquered the beast. Everyone believed me, the fools. I merely hid and grew stronger. I gathered my forces. I prepared for the worst in secret. I knew I had not seen pain in my life as others have seen pain. I knew there would come a time when I would feel real pain and not want it to go away, and that would be the true test of my strength  that strength I have worked so hard to garner all this time. Tara is gone, and this is the time when I need to be strong. I time will come when I will hurt even worse. Tragedy will strike, and how will I handle it? Will I balloon again? Will I shut everyone out? Will I hurt somebody? Will I hurt myself?  The battle is raging inside of me right now. The food is still downstairs, and I am very hungry. My dog is still missing. I see no end in sight. My final semester of college begins in two days. I am not ready. I am still waiting for Tara to return. I want to stay at home and eat and not go to school, but I cant. I have to live my life. I have to face my demon alone. I need to reach that light in the distance. I need to find a way to hurt without hurting,  and without swallowing all my pain. I can no longer run away.  This is it. Wish me luck.

       Help me fix Tara?   Hi.  As you all know, recently Tara ran away from home. She was found by a lady who took Tara to her sister's house, because she knew her sister liked dogs. Tara had torn her tags off so nobody knew anything about her.  I was very sad, and wanted my dog. She ran away on a Saturday, and the pound didn't open until Monday, so I went in on Monday and they said someone said they found a dog fitting Tara's description. Anyway, they called the wrong person, gave me the wrong phone number, so I couldn't get ahold of the lady. I went back in Wednesday early and they called her again, and this time got ahold of her. When I got there I was all :hyper: that I got my dog back... but it's not that simple.  The lady said she did not respond to "Tara." I find out later, it's because she named her Lidsey, or Linsey, or something like that. I found out she expected to keep Tara, because she "thought she had been abandoned." She had fallen in love with my dog, and was sad to see her go. So her husband followed us home to see where Tara lives, and the next day she shows up with her dog wanting to see Linsey " -- I mean Tara." She comes around and does a bit of criticizing, telling me to do this and do that, and that everything I learned about training her was wrong. I assume she's right since this is my first dog, and Tara was very calm when she returned.  However, I feld bad. The lady said that to train a dog you must establish your dominance over it. You must show the dog that you're bigger and stronger, which means kneeing the dog when it jumps, and throwing a dog on its back. I said I was afraid to, because I just couldn't bring myself to hurting Tara. She said I had to... it's the only way to train her... it's the ONLY WAY she'll learn!  But I didn't do it. The lady came back, and she'd do it whenever Tara did something she didn't like, she'd basically scream and yell and force her to the ground. She started saying how she was like Tara's mommy, and how her dog was like Tara's mommy... and all this creepy stuff. She always second guessed me, but like, she had me bring Tara back to her place and let her run around. I wasn't comfortable. I didn't want Tara thinking she was moving back or whatever. Anyway, I just got really really weird vibes from the lady, and was tired anyway, so I pretty much said I didn't like the mixed signals Tara was getting, and wanted to be Tara's owner, since she was getting confused with this lady coming around acting like the dominant female. She got the hint and said she doesn't have to come around anymore, I said she could give me a week or two to get back to normal with Tara, she said okay.  Now I'm not so sure. Now I think "never again" seems like long enough.  See, Tara and the lady's dog would fight for dominance, as would the lady and Tara, and Tara and another dog living at the duplex in which they live. So basically, Tara does what she's told to do by those bigger and stronger than her. She is submissive.  But this lady doesn't have children around. : Today, Tara was in the kitchen and my niece went out there to play with her... but Tara wanted to go for a walk.My niece tried to get out of the kitchen, but Tara would jump up on the gate between the kitchen and the rest of the house and block her way. When my niece tried to get past, Tara would nip. She chased the girl into a corner and would nip at her, and bit her a couple times. She doesn't bite real hard, of course... but she bit.  She established dominance over a 9 year old girl.  I was taught to train Tara with love and reward, to build a trusting relationship between pet and owner. The lady who found my dog told me that was all wrong. Now Tara is confused. She may be completely torn now. Hopefully, when the lady told me to put Tara on her back, Tara has forgiven me. I have no interest in teaching a dog that I'm its master. I want a friendly dog, not a broken one.  How can I undo this?  PS: This was less a question, more of a rant.

      SHE IS BACK!  The pound fucked up, right. They gave us the wrong number so this lady hasn't returned any calls because she didn't get any! Ah! The lady we've been calling probably has been away on vacation. ANYWAY. We go back there today and ask, and they call the lady again, who is home and says it looks like her but doesn't respond to the name "Tara." Of course, it's been what, 5 days and she hasn't been called Tara since then? I'm sure she's gotten used to being called "Girl" or "Puppy" or whatever. So...   We go and visit and she's out front with Tara... omg I had a heart attack... we got out and I called Tara and she came to me but was a bit hesitant... like she wasn't sure who I was... but after a few minutes she warmed up to me. I wanted to squeeze the life out of her but it's just kinda hard with the big beast.  Anyway... the lady wasn't too happy... she said we did things wrong, first of all letting her go and not having tags on her... :p and then said the collar was too tight, but nobody said anything before! She has a gentle leader, though, and THAT isn't too tight... the lady put the collar on with a leash and that choked Tara, but we don't use the collar to put on a leash, so you know...   Anyway, the lady says when she's offered money for her trouble, "oh no, you don't have enough money to cover what she's done..." apparently Tara chewed the arm of a 2100 dollar antique chair and then another one, a big leather recliner which has to be at least what, 600 dollars I'd think. But a lot, nonetheless. So yeah, I felt bad but also thought, "yep, that's my girl." I knew when she disappeared that if someone picked her up that their woodwork was in trouble.  Anyway, the lady felt bad, and didn't want to part with Tara... apparently, she worked real hard with her and her other dog got along great with Tara and Tara is a sweetie. I do feel bad, and you know, part of me wanted to let her keep Tara but heh, FUCK YOU that's MY dog. I may not be the best owner... and I may fuck up a lot since she's my first dog... but she's mine! Damn it! It's my girl. I let her maul me when we got home, and we walked around a bit, but I came online to tell some people who have been worried that I got her... by the way, thanks for your concern all yall, and I apologize for being so on edge. I really have not been sleeping well at all, because whenever I sleep I'm having dreams/nightmares about her. But I'm okay now... and I gotta go spend more time with her.  Ta ta. :):):)

      Tara Update:  So a lady told the pound she found a golden dog with pointy ears and blue eyes. (HMMMMMMMMMM) and left her number. The pound called who they thought was her -- was it? Maybe.  But fact of the matter is, whoever it was hasn't returned any calls and will not answer her fucking phone. Ever. So... no Tara, still. I don't even know if this is Tara.  I WANT TARA BACK.  WHY AM I BEING DICKED AROUND.  AGH  I am so intolerable right now. I hate everyone. My patience is way beyond worn thin. I can't handle this. My girl is missing and I'm not getting answers... I am going insane.  :(

      Oh, hi.  I haven't really been posting much, per se, only uploading stuff I do, like pictures of the family and my girl :( as well as my essays.  Well Liv made mention in a comment down VVV there about Tara so I figured I'd let you all know that she ran away yesterday while I was working. She's still gone, and the idea is that if she's still alive, she was either taken by someone (How often do you find such a gorgeous dog with blue eyes?) or animal control was called.  The latter has a good chance of having happened, because without tags (she removed them herself), and being such a big dog, people would be afraid of her and call animal control. Remember, she loves people, especially little kids, so if she tried playing with a kid, the kid would have gotten hurt and Tara would be in trouble.  God, I want her back. I miss her a lot and now all I can do is think about how I should have been a better owner :(  *sigh* anyway... feel free to comment on my essays if you read them... I don't really need encouragement or anything like that, these are creative pieces... so feel free to critique or whatever.  Just let me know you're alive.

        Swallowed  Eulogy    I need to set the record straight. I once wrote about my former self, that I killed him, as though he was an insect, or an unsavory character. That is not true, not at all. The old me, while gone, is not forgotten, and most definitely not hated. On two levels, I love who I used to be. Part of me misses it  the anonymity, the personal space, the unaccountability. All of that was great, but Im happier without it. I will discuss this further in the future. Right now I aim to reconcile myself to Scott Wenker, circa 2001 AD. I want to give his eulogy.  I saw my Auntie for the first time in months recently, and she had to reintroduce me to her son, whom I had not seen, I think, since a year ago. What that means is he had not met the new me, he met the old me. My aunt said, This is your cousin Scott. He used to be really big. Really, really, really, really, REALLY big, give or take a few reallys. The point is, I was reallyreallyreallyreallyreallyreally big. My brother, John was with me at the time, and later commented that it was in poor taste. He felt offended for me, because what she said was an attack. I really didnt have the words to come out and correct him; after all, I appreciate that he cares.  Thats the thing, though. My family and friends, the people who know me and knew me then, these people know how to handle the old me. They are still getting used to the new me. They know how sensitive I was, and they were careful to steer everyone clear of mentioning (my weight). They spoke in whispers, (Scott broke a chair today). In a way, just like I grew to appreciate who I was, so did they. Families who have to deal with a handicapped child are a lot better at learning patience and tolerance. My family learned how to deal with obesity. Everyone who knew me, knew all the ins and outs of fat people. Perhaps thats one of the few good things to come out of it all  it was a learning experience. Yeah, I can keep telling myself that.  The point of it all is that we had all grown attached to who I was  defensive. Holy shit, my mom was and is the master of excuses. Why was I fat? Well I broke my leg 12 years ago. She literally absolved me from all responsibility for anything wrong with me  anything that Ive ever done or said. Shes good. I hate it now, of course. I desperately wish I had accountability back then, but I cant change the past. I am no longer bitter towards my mom for who I was. After all, she helped out a lot when I lost the weight. She only wanted me to get what I wanted. I guess that before I was ready what I wanted was to stay fat. The fat bubble is a safe place to hide.  But the protectiveness of my family for the bigger, fatter Scott, while very touching, is kind of saddening. I assume they are just getting used to the new me, or they just cant quite wrap their heads around the fact that I am not him anymore. I do not want to think that they are attached, that they want the old me back. Its possible  I was a lot easier to please; as I have said in the past, just give me a burrito or two and I would crawl back in my hole and you wouldnt hear from me for days. Regardless, Im here and I sure as hell hope its to stay. It is up to my loved ones to deal with that.   My nephew Josh and my niece Sam dealt with it amazingly. Of course, Im still fat, thats true. Josh pointed that out to me one day, and I was shocked! Comparatively, Im a fucking waif! But this is child logic, and I appreciate it. I would definitely not want to have to reintroduce myself. Of course, Josh was there with me during the weight loss, and he did acknowledge it  he knew I had changed, just never made a big deal of it. God bless him. As for his sister, she hasnt really said anything to me about it. She is getting to the point in her life where her mind is working on a higher level than Joshs, so she knows that my weight is a touchy subject. She doesnt know what to say, or if she can even say anything. I appreciate that as well. I take comfort in people treating me normally. While I enjoy the attention I get, it gets overwhelming and I feel the freak show. Samantha and Josh provide that break.  As I wander further and further from my point, I feel the need to wrap it up quickly. My family is defensive of me because who I used to be. They are still defensive of the old me as though he is still a part of the family. Maybe I did kill him, and my family is mourning the loss. But while I have moments when I wish I was fat again, just to have all that extra padding to float through existence, I am very glad that me is gone. I am glad he is gone, and I am not offended when somebody says I used to be really, really, really, really, really, really, really big. Why would I be? I used to shit my pants and was breastfed. I wet the bed and was afraid of the dark. I had imaginary friends and I sounded like a girl. This is all in the past. This is who I used to be. Why should I be ashamed of who I was in another life?

      Here is a piece I did for my advanced non-fiction class. I had to relate to a piece of art at a museum.  Swallowed  Disembodied. By Scott Wenker.  Oh, once-proud behemoth, what has become of you? Your body is gone, your air returning it to the earth that bore you. Once fearsome and imposing, once standing tall, once frightening evil away. You once cast a formidable shadow underneath the burning sun. Now you are haloed by it. Look at you. You spent an eternity standing guard, and now you are a work of art.  In that place you spent your youth and most of your life, you were left alone. Some would stand before you in reverence or awe, while others cowered in fear. You never looked upon them, however. You looked always forward, never meeting their gaze. You did not want to see the reverence, the awe, the fear. Only to stand there. Alone. Forever.  But through some blunt force trauma or the wearing on of years, your body deteriorated into nothing. The once-imposing statue was now just a head. The guardian was no more. When Lord Elgin sacked the Parthenon, it was a proud, imposing building. He removed the marble friezes and put them on display. What once was architecture became art. The monstrous became small  You are smaller now than you once were, and all the passers-by look upon you through a new lens. Once upon a time they looked on you in horror and awe. That monster, that beast, towering over them capable of crushing them at any moment. You never moved, not for an instant. But you knew that if you had to, if it was important enough, you would move. Gods help them all when you did. You were the monster. You were the giant.  Oh, you once-proud and self-reliant giant. You stood your ground for so long and nobody could budge you. The weight of your body held you down. You kept the greedy little hands at bay. But your body wore down. Youve become small, youve become weak. Those hands that feared you now lift you up like a baby. You are helpless and prone. Your life is no longer your own.  They put you on display in a shiny glass box. They invent your history, they tell you what you are and what has become of you. They look at you and think, wow, look at what he is, and they look at all of your flaws. They discuss your face and ponder every crack. Like your sister the Sphinx, you have lived a long, embattled existence. Her broken nose is considered beautiful. You wonder what they would say to your face if you were still the same size. You recall that your flaws, then, were insignificant in your shadow. You think, if she had lost her head as I have lost mine, what would they think of the Sphinx?   You can remember when you were a younger statue, how alone you felt. You saw people, but they refused to come near. They stood off in the distance, because you were too big to see up close. Now that you are smaller, you are passed over, crowded, overwhelmed, ignored or scrutinized by a whirlwind of people. You tell them where you came from and what happened to you, but you are separated from them. They cannot hear your voice. These people, they do not fear you anymore. You are no longer regarded as a colossus. In fact, you are hardly regarded at all. Face it. You are just a face. Your body has blown away. You are on display, and its better that way.

      Just wanted to let you all know that I am in fact NOT dead, rather Vy thew me in a shallow grave until I would give birth to Miguel's baby, at which time he would take the baby from me, kill me, and pass the baby off as his own.  Have faith, gentile readers. I mean gentle... or do I?  I am still surviving... but I'd be a lot better with my dog back.

Now I try not to think about it, so that I'm not unbearable to be around... and thus am not working to get her back. And it eats at me more and more.  I'm not doing so well at handling this.

       Alphabean,   I hope you can take what I say seriously (sometimes it's easy to assume that people aren't being serious or are speaking tongue-in-cheek), but I just wanted to say that I respect you.  I respect you for the fact that you made your "who I am" thread a longways back, and I also respect you for the fact that you've lost a lot of weight.   Believe it or not, I too started trying to lose weight when I heard about what you did. I've lost 15 pounds in the last 3 months.   Anyways - just wanted to let you know that.    take care.   Oh man. Shit like this makes life worth living.

      GOBBLE GOBBLE.  Since Thanksgiving is about THANKS and GIVING... well maybe it's not... but since we're in the Holiday season, with the spirit of giving upon us, I have to wonder...  Why is it that most bloggers blog all the time and almost never comment on other blogs, and even more rarely reply to their own comments? This has always been a big issue with me. Comments are what makes a blog. All of my posts suck until people comment. Then it makes the posts real.  Comment, suckas, don't make me get violent.

I'm just posting it as though I think it's a finished piece... so... anyone who comes here and reads one of my unfinished pieces is going to be like *sticks nose up* "Oh that stinks, his structure is all wrong... and his form is atrocious!"

      Come on, read my essay! :(  Anyway, updates: All that's left to do for me is my presentation, final portfolio and final draft of my senior paper. That's going really well, my Prof. really likes it, so I'm pretty sure I'll be at least passing that, then it's off to graduation on the 12th... or is it 14th?  Anyway, like 3 weeks left before graduation oh man.  Also, I got some good news last week... well, uh, kind of good news? My surgery has been bumped up from January to December 29th, so I'll be popping pills for New Years rather than drinking. No partying for me :(  So you know what rules? TURKEY BURGERS. WHO'S WITH ME, HUH?  Mmmmmm...  Speaking of which, I had fat free tortillas today. Which is insane since the main ingredient in tortillas is, well, fat. But they were GOOD. Really chewy, yes, but GOOD! I like my tortillas chewy. If I want doughy tortillas, I'd just flatten my slices of bread.  OH! And to add to my week being a GOOD week, I got information that I will be able to extend my family tree on all sides wayyyyyyyy back now. On my dad's side there is info dating back to the Revolutionary War, and on my mom's side I found a woman who has a huge line up her grandpa's side... but then a cousin has info about my mom's dad's side... kicks ass. Confusing? Yes. Disregard.  The other good(great) news is that I've been published! My essay "Swallowed," the 3rd draft of it, has been OKed to go into the University of Minnesota Literary/Art journal for this year.   I wish it was going to be in paper form as it has been in years past, but with the budget cuts, no such luck. Online publication for me.  Ah well, it's the first time I've ever sent anything in to be published, so I'm happy. :)

      Hey, kids.  I have less than one month remaining before I retire! I mean graduate! Man, time flies way too fast...  Thursday I have my third essay due, then all that's left is to do my final portfolio for my non-fiction class, the final draft of my Senior Paper and the presentation for my senior paper! Then it will be graduation... then Christmas... then New Years then I will try to vacation before surgery.  ANYONE WANT TO GIVE ME GRADUATION PRESENTS? :)  I got in touch with a friend last week and am having lunch tomorrow... but I saw her today at the bus stop and leaned against the glass right in front of her, because I'm a funny guy. It feels good to know somebody from school. Like, I've been there five years (I know, I know...) and I haven't made any friends. Granted, I've kind of been afraid of people most of those years, but lately I've had NO EXCUSE!  Actually I have plenty of excuse, since you know, I've been hanging out with a girl after class every single day, adore her immensely but I'm never going to be able to tell her this. Why? Because I'm a great big loser. Everyone tells me the same thing: "Derr, ask her out!" HA! This is the Bean. That is not in my vocabulary. I respect people too much to ask them out :p  I'm pretty sure she won't see this though, thankfully. It would take a lot of work on her part to find it... so if she finds it, it means she's interested, and in that case, I'm glad. :) And if I happen to show her AlphaBean.net in the future, it will mean I grew balls and etc...  I'm rambling. My mind has been mush the last few whatevers. I have way too much shit going on in my head, while just a few short years ago it was like... "Wake up... shower... school... sleep."  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS?

      Change of plans!   My doctor, the high-priced superstar surgeon, who makes like a billion dollars an hour, sliced his hand open badly over the weekend, forcing him to cancel all of his appointments for today! So I got my physical, took three showers last night and this morning, got two hours of sleep, went to the damn place and then the lady was like "Oh... nobody told you!? Oops! He canceled all of his surgeries for today!"  So I stood there and didn't talk while the nurse tried explaining what's up, then was like "Yeah whatever," and she said it would be like three weeks... but since my insurance is out, I wasn't happy. But today they rescheduled. Surgery on the fifth!  So anyway, I was looking for something for Sarah but I couldn't find it :( So I'm just going to get ready and go visit her.  *runs*  If I don't see you... happy new year!

      ARGH!  So Christmas is coming soon, and I haven't done but a smidge of shopping for everyone. I've been busy, and not really interested.   But now I am...  ...and it's almost too late. :(  See, it's funny. I finished my final final. I finished my portfolio. I graduated. I'm done. I sat through the loooooooong commencement which was made enjoyable by the company I kept, then I went to the University president's mansion -- the one he lives in rent-free along with the 360k yearly income -- for being the president. Doesn't even have to teach, the freak. Anyway, I ate a few pounds of dessert bars and several glasses of Strawberry punch before going out for Mexican to the greatest place in the world, ironically named La Cucaracha. I got a margarita the size of my head and when I was done with all that, the night was still young, so I hung out with a fellow graduate and it was an awesome night.  Okay, enough about graduation.  Now on to the bitching: I did my pre-op physical today, and I'm cleared. The Dr. didn't feel anything abnormal when he rubbed my testicles, except my knee in his groin. I will be OK to get surgeried next Monday! Then, no more typing for meeeeee!  This is problematic. It's like, I was not worried at all about my finals or commencement, for one reason or another, but here I am, graduated (potentially), with my whole life ahead of me, but my surgery has me so down. What the hell?   I'm being all whiney and gay and weak. It will pass once I get the surgery over with, but until then I need some strength. Any Capricorns out there willing to be my stabilizing force?

      So I pride myself on being honest, right? Like, I don't hide anything... everyone knows my baggage, you all know me. I never pretended I wasn't obese or a loser or anything. Yeah, I'm insecure; yeah, I have a big ego and I use the internet to validate that. I don't pull punches and I don't fake things.  But then, I get accused a lot of being dishonest, or a liar, or full of shit. And why? Because there are things I just don't know, but I think I know. There are things I feel, believe, think, whatever, at the time, but it changes. My opinion on a subject changes. I explain something one way and realize maybe that's not the way it goes. I am erratic. I cannot hold on to one definition of anything, to one absolute. As far as explanations go, reasoning, feelings, thoughts, it is all dynamic. My thoughts change with the wind.  If you are at odds with yourself, does that make you dishonest? If you honestly believe something, but believe something entirely different 30 seconds later, what do you classify that as? How do you deal with it? How do you overcome it? Is it something that can be accepted and lived with?  I'm erratic, but I can't lie. The fact that I can't stick to one excuse should be a testament to that. If I was a better liar, when I make an excuse I would stick to it just to keep everyone happy. That would be a lie, rather than utter confusion and fickleness.  I never stop thinking, so how can I possibly not change my mind?

      Oh man. I hate this. Every time I make a new blog entry, it ends up on another one of my blogs. Blah...guh. I hate it. So here is my last entry, which I posted yesterday.  I need a job!  All right, so, as you will all notice by my previous post, I had gone a little insane from my shoulder. Other factors factored into it, but basically my shoulder made me feel completely useless, helpless, vulnerable. Which makes me needy. Which makes me whiney.  Thankfully, the people who matter were understanding of my predicament, and hopefully in the coming days, as I adjust to the way things are and my shoulder gets better, I, too, will get better. However, last night and today I didn't do my shoulder any favors, taxing it quite a bit more than I should; I'm still supposed to be in a sling for a week or two. But my arm starts feeling good, and then... :( I'm a stupidhead.  So... tomorrow is Amanda's baptism; John, my bro is the godfather, Nicole, my cousin, the Godmother. She gets to be Godmother of Josh and Amanda, because the pickins are slim in the chick department in my family I guess. That's okay, though. Josh is all I need.  Speaking of Josh, I noticed that the last few days, all I do when talking about kids is gush about Josh. Just how awesome and sweet and smart and hilarious he is, and how it's ALL THANKS TO ME. Not all thanks to me, but I take credit for a lot of it. But yeah, I gush. A lot. It got me thinking, if I ever have a kid, could that kid ever mean more to me than Josh does? I mean, the logical answer is, OF COURSE, it's your kid, it's inevitable!  But then, it's scary. Because Josh means everything to me. I miss him... he's not been around very much, and he's been real sad. I need to start driving so I can pick him up and take him places.  Yeah.

      All right... so it's what, Wednesday? No, it's Thursday. I don't know. I can't keep track. Wednesday I took the bandages off. I took the painkiller catheter out, because it bothered me. I should have left it in.  I'm taking Vicodin, and it is making me slow. It is making me stupid. And moody. Maybe it's not the Vicodin... no it's not the Vicodin. It's everything. I'm so weak and dependent right now... I need people to do things for me, but I don't want to hassle them. I know I hassle them, too, so I'm just keeping my mouth shut.  I can't open my fucking pill bottles!  I am feeling very useless, very weak and very isolated. And to top it off, it feels like I'm not getting sympathy... like it's my fault that I'm depressed. Like I need to change. Yay, that makes it worse. So I want to just close myself off, but I can't do anything by myself.  Sarah suggested I see someone, perhaps get medicated. I suppose I should... but then, I don't see the dr. again until the 15th, so that's an entire week until then.  So now I'm going to be unbearable, and people will take it personally and hold it against me, and I can't stop it.   God damn.  All this whining, and all that's wrong with me is a bad shoulder. I guess it just goes to show me that I couldn't handle anything serious. Yay.

       The day of reckoning is upon us!   Dearest friends,  I am currently fighting off the heartburn from some leftover pasta, and buffalo wings from lunch, not willing to lie down as it would make it worse. However, lying down would mean sleeping, and since I have to be up at like 5 for my rescheduled appointment...  ...apparently, he was scheduling them in order of their importance, and mine is the first he is doing. I think I'm kind of scared, as far as that's concerned. I mean, granted his other surgeries might be something real minor, but still, I've never even thought of my situation as more or less major than anything else. But now...?  Anyway, it will be good. I'll get to come home and have soup and take a nap, and then Sarah will come visit me and I will be the happiest guy ever. And I don't just mean from the drugs. :P  Anyway I'm gonna go to bed soon, and just take the two antiseptic soap showers in the morning beforehand... Argh, typing will be so very gay, so I unlikely will be doing any typing at all.  Am I scared? No. I just know I'm going to be miserable, and that will be an inconvenience.  OK lish me wuck.

      Okay yeah I haven't been around, but then I have an excuse. You saw how all my previous posts have been! I hadn't previously gotten better, but I am, I am. I feel pretty good today. I had an all right weekend, hey. I get the feeling all of my weekends from here on out are going to get increasingly better. My birthday weekend is after Jay's birthday weekend, and for Jay's we're going up north for snowmobiling... which I won't be doing, mind you, but it will be fun to be there. Drinking and hanging out or something. Hot tub and all that.  Anyway...  I am almost at the halfway point in my rehab. ONLY TWO MONTHS LEFT before I'm CLEARED to do ANYTHING I WANT. It will be justabout one year to the day that it took for me to overcome this fucking gay ass stupid argh, shoulder injury. It shouldn't have taken so long, and maybe I'll sue the University of Minnesota for it!  Because it seriously hampered my style, but then I'm not exactly going to knock anything that has happened to me recently... since any one of the things happening to me that I hated, could have changed and altered my life for what I would have thought as the better, but then, it might have prevented one of the awesome things that have happened to me... like Sarah.   Do I believe in fate or cause and effect? Probably not. But I won't rule it out. I just know a good thing, which negates the bad things.  I'm very sleepy right now, but I figured I'd pop something up in case anyone reads this thing anymore.  u take care now ok

       My birthday is in five days! Anyone still read this thing? Send your cards soonly!    So it snowed a lot last Friday, and Friday was when my family went to Lake Superior for a mini-vacation for my brother's 31st birthday. Since John finally got a job, he couldn't shovel, so me, the dummy that I am, shoveled, and am still trying to get my shoulder back into shape. I could hardly move it all weekend. Man, this sucks ass. But May 5th is the scheduled clearance date... hopefully I will survive until then... cause the weather will be great and basketball season will commence!  So in sadder news, Tara's brother, Joe was finally given up for adoption. Jay's wife wanted Joe, but refused to ever walk him or train him or anything, so he was a great big wild puppy who had hardly any human interaction. And as such, the lady who adopted him got bit twice in the face, and gave him up. My dad has him now, and chances are, since my dad already has an old dog living with him, Joe is going to be put down. Of course, Dad likes him, so maybe he'll keep him, but...  Anyway, I don't really like Joe all that much, but he's Tara's twin brother, so I could look at him and see his sister. Sometimes I see dogs I think are her, and when I really think it's her, I just look away. What do I do if I see her? Demand her back? She doesn't remember me anymore. She'd run away to  them . Like I've said before, it's best just to believe she's dead... because whether she's alive or not, the Tara I knew is dead, as she wouldn't respond to that name anymore. :( I'm okay though. I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshiiiiiiiiiiine after the raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaii aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii aiiiiiiiii aiiiii aiiiiiiiiiii a aaaaaaaaaiiiiiiin...  Woo woo woo my birthday is coming up! I need to do something with my life... post-grad life is booooooooring, and my shoulder shouldn't be an excuse not to be working. Anyone have a job for me? Plz?

      Okay I'm going to just work with a basic template for right now, until I can get going again.  I just hated the way my old blog looked. I hate a lot of things lately.  I think I need to get going doing some writings, but I'm afraid they'll be slathered in broken-hearted pining and whining, so I have to be careful.  I dunno when I'm going to put everything back on my blog, I might just wait until I redo the layout before I bother inserting links and all that other shit.   I keep thinking of things I want to write about but I later forget. I did it again.  Herm.  I hate mosquitoes. They might just be the worst thing in the history of the world. I have a big swollen bite on my arm that looked like someone shot me with a potato gun or something. I wonder if I caught the West Nile virus.  So how are the two of you reading this?
