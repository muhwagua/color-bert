      When i was seventeen my boyfriend had  A Harley Davidson. That summer i loved    To ride with him across the Golden Gate.  As we rumbled along the highway, six lanes  Became two, while the ends of my hair flew And prickled my shoulders.  i'd squeeze him as we leaned Into the curves. My shirt would snap and buzz  Behind us like a flag, and the wind tore at  My back and my arms and bare ankles. The sun  Would burn through my jeans to the tops of my thighs.  We'd stop inside an ancient whitewashed diner (Complete with screen door and a ceiling fan) To eat our cheeseburgers, drink our cherry cokes, And giggle and kiss on red vinyl and chrome.   Then lazing away on the bench outside the door,  We'd smoke our cigarettes, with RayBans on, Swishing flies in the shade, and looking up. The eucalyptus leaves shimmered over our heads.  We watched the purple shadows stretch away From us across the silvery pavement  As the silent, sleepy afternoon went by.  Thus fortified, we'd swing our denim legs  Over our seat again and back onto The roaring bike we headed to the City. i kept my fingers curled under his belt,  My cheek was pressed against his sweating back, And on my lips i wore  A smile, a smile, a smile.

      Pete Tells me he loves me.  i've not heard that one before.  He waits for my reply. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pete tells me i'm pretty;  Words that are kisses to me. Peter knows why i'm here. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pete is alone tonight; Alone with thoughts of me. Jealousy begets jealousy. &nbsp; &nbsp; Ten is the number of Pete. A solid number, and proud. A standard to judge others by. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pete says little Johnnie  Misses my moistening lips; My silvery dancing stud. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pete is a whispering breeze.  He embraces me all at once.  Covers me with gentle strokes.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Pete is a tiger cub. He's cute and cuddly and strong; Ferocious when he's grown. &nbsp; &nbsp; Pete far away is a cipher. He's different because he's in love. i speak to hide his silence. &nbsp; &nbsp; Hold my hand dearest Peter. Take me and pull me to you. Take me, i'll be leaving soon. &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me Pete, say it. i don't want to say it to you. Goodbye, i'll see you soon.

      is it right that i wear your wingtips? and should you wear my sandals? where is my freedom; who are we? is this how i was found?  i give you escape from this, your cage  of cars, offices, wood paneled rooms you stole from a spider to make me grow from a dream you gave me birth and life   i breathe, i play, and flirt for you i love for you, but my self-destruction threatens  if i burn too hot or if i'm found out  will you put me back in my box? am i your hindrance?  do i put you in prison? were you already there? do i subtract from you?  as Jekyll did, you rush home each day to lock your door and hide and yes, i know how you long to set me free to mix and drink the poison called me  we hurry through each seven days for each Saturday we wait  in hopeful dread; the happy week complete  you give me a new face to play in  i write poems for you because you cannot i dance, i drink, i laugh for you even fuck for you i want to live, you don't, i cannot  the bad girls of your youth taught you my smile, and you loved me then we walked together before i was born you knew i was, and wanted me  because i'm within you i will not leave  i am the naked swimmer who floats  in the white lagoon of your mind: my home is blue-eyed, sun-tanned, tattooed, warm  and i choose the lovers: the boys and girls  we dance in the sand barefoot for you they press their hands upon my hips intently you watch under torch-lit sky   you sit alone beside a bar and i stare at you, my cheek against  another shoulder, strong or thin as each young dancer holds me tighter  but tonight i am chaste, and when i return  you go to smoke your cigarette and i to smoke my pipe and in the dark i take your hand   then in your room you touch yourself  lovingly, while i kiss your lips and place myself back into your box to watch you suffer until tomorrow  you created me but you cannot make me real or else we could love each other as you always wanted to   but if you want  i will wear your wingtips tomorrow and you can wear my sandals

      Upon what foul passions plotted; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What gods kiss silken lips, And with bitter trancendence taste &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immortal dreams of fate?

      Aloha! and the Royal Hawaiian where it all began. The Outrigger Waikiki Surf  and Steinhardt's, leaving.  Walk, don't walk. Denny's, and the karaoke. A girl says to her friends:  "that guy by the newspapers said..."  Hawaiian rock, people bored on lounge chairs watching... as bored as me? They don't know what to do.  Not here for the music either: Righteous Brothers and the 50's muzak for the gray fat older man, dancing  aloha shirt and lei. Lot of first nighters admire a buffet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Vegasization &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	of Hawaii.  Overheard near a phone on Kuhio. Two guys meet two Japanese girls. "How long you here?" asks one.  "We only got two days."  To buddy aside: "She's a nurse."  (Fake falling down) "She'll take good care of me." (and pause) To girls he says: "So anyways  where you girls going tonight?" They giggle (a giggle that betrays none of what they're thinking).  Found the place! No jazz! Nothing but a hostess in  her white blouse and smile; she's apologetic, intoxicating. She looks like she's  from Spain.  Her black skirt her brown legs...  The district of Kuhio. Towels, t-shirts, Ray Bans three for twelve or twenty-five to forty-five off. Multi-colored pants and luggage.  Taps, Converse and Armani  inside there's Karaoke  White lady in a Muu Muu  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	perhaps the ugliest  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	piece of women's  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	clothing ever  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	devised.  Prostitute on phone: "No sir." Three guys, two young girls.  Lotsa guys in jeeps. Three stunning black men with two prostitutes. Their satin waists  wrinkled, tightening as they balance and twist  on floral spike heels.  Thick legged ladies, and Japanese couples, pink-faced from the sun, holding hands. Newlyweds, second honeymooners. (As if holding hands will help.)  The young males come in two main types:  militaries - punks. Just the same as  all white boys and out for sex or trouble. The black boys like to yell and swear  their blackness as a badge.   Interesting vignette. From a car that honked, yelling obscenities  at a group of other punks.  Why so loud? They look for any confrontation.  Then down the street comes one, a tower of quiet strength, alone with pacific expression  He reminds them to behave.  Bored, i could go  back home. ((No jazz.) (Other bored people have others to be bored with too.) (Another Jeep-full of guys screaming.)) back to Waipahu.  Instead i go to the beach.  ---  Old lady swings a fancy metal detector Black lace black shirt black bra black hair black striped  Sarong and a thing on her head that looked like a showercap A pastel multi-colored lei around Her head probably silk and pink and blue Yellow expensive looking metal detector Small black fish net and bag to put her loot. Amber street lights just came on. The khaki Row of the olive trees announce the park (Kapiolani?). Amber lights and red Taillights. Distant sound of crowds like roller- Coasters. Momentary scream of girls.   The metal detector lady has stopped to talk To guitar player and his wife on a towel.   ---  All people in this world can be divided into two types:  those who think it's cute when parents let their toddlers run around naked  on the beach, and those who think &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               it's shameful.   ---  The Royal Hawaiian is on my right.  (1927)  A truly great hotel on par with the Coronado.  Torches line the patio and  pink half-buried trash cans face the roped-off beach.  Reminders not to mess  the public view of the guests.  A cop rides by on an ATV.   Sitting on a sea wall, waiting, nothing yet.  Some people looking up.  A few small fireworks shot from boats.  Ship lights blinking on.  i count them. Over thirty.   A drunk local plays with a braid  of his own hair. A friend calls to him.  Kids carry their wrapped surf boards back to the rental counter.  "Dad! Dad! Dad! You know I saw some lizard in the bushes!"   On my right:  a little man with a bag and white cap,  his aloha shirt unbuttoned low,  tucked into his Bermuda shorts.  He cruised by twice already.  He looks at me, then he looks at the latin man with a mustache, who's standing  alone in a striped open-collar dress shirt.  His feet haven't moved since i been here,  he keeps his flip-flops in hand.  Then just as they sensed me watching,  they're gone off along the strand.   On my left:  an older gent with his wife sit down. Well bred, not too old, wears his tan well.  Still handsome, with a touch of bald in back.  He lights a cig and while we wait,  two lovers play in the surf.  In unison they fall forward into the water  they butterfly a few strokes, then spin onto their backs and stand up.   Arriving on a catamaran, someone blows a conch shell. A flash of red falls to the water. (This is it, i think.) No, it came from the boat.  "Es'cuze do you know miss, is any firework tonight?" (The older gent is French.) i gesture sadly to my left,  over to Diamond Head, toward the flashes near the park. "i think we're in the wrong place."   Tradewinds pick up a bamboo mat it blows across the sand.  It belongs to the lovers from the sea,  The pretty blonde and her husband.  She chases after their little mat huraches in her hand.   A little girl catches the bamboo mat And now it starts to rain. She hands it to the laughing blonde. who bends to give her a kiss. The little girl runs back to her mommy who wraps her in a towel.   Someone shoots off  a flare from a boat.  It's our only firework tonight. The flare is the kind that floats on a parachute, and as it drifts down i hear:  "Mommy that's my guardian angel."  "I'm sure it is, my dear." While the ocean fairly glows with light from a spotlight atop the Royal Hawaiian.

      A homeless dude pushes his shopping cart. He scrapes along, panhandling for a buck. His doglike face displays his rotten luck. By looks and taunts he'll 'vance his filthy art. My eyes ahead i'm trying to pretend i cannot see; i haven't what he wants. And walking on, and feigning nonchalance, From out his grasp my path i hope to wend. We're more alike, the dirty thief and i, Than either me or he are like to say. For while his street's a toilet, mine's an ashtray And neither will lift a finger to get him by.  Except the Lord commands to each a task, A simple one: to give to all who ask.

       What was that funky smell I smell’t? that ruined my Saturday morning wafted up from somewhere I didn’t know and couldn’t find.   Is it in my hair? it’s a mystery I check my sweatshirt is it my socks is it my seat is it my pants is it my pits my t-shirt, my bra,  my crotch, my car? none of these things.   Stink that came and went on an unfelt breeze furtively, like a baby skunk was it dead?   Am I dead? Did I die and nobody told me does anybody notice can’t you smell it what is it damn smell where are you  what are you?  I wanted to sit and read by the Palace, in the park  I wanted to enjoy my coffee my Ginsberg my William Carlos Williams these nasty squirrels twittering turning over acorns fighting and scattering around my feet is it you?  This funk followed me, not you it was there in the morning while I brushed my hair with the creeping sunrise when I flossed my teeth I checked under the bed.   Damn funk you tormented me hid in the dark poking out like a squirrel scratching your claws around the tree trunk in your spiral ascent when my back was turned you disappeared when I jumped and spoke my expletive.   In the shower scrubbing a mad woman draped in soap bubbles, whipped white zesty froth like churned cum, dripping down from last night’s fog down sloping hills, valleys down forests, smooth limbs through toes and swirling into the gulping grated drain.   Soap of love wash away my funk, this stench.

      O nameless, faceless, one:  My soul is park'd before thee, blood red, torn open to thine eyes.  Of thee, pray, from my love, my lives, oh gather from these bursting buds, sweetest fancy of my cries, be they forlorn or heaven bent, lest i wilt, lest they be spent.  As thou art a honeybee, let me be flower to thee!

      Somebody stole the Annika car! Now this is quite a shock I searched around the corner I looked all round the block  The Annika car’s been stolen! I loved that car so much A thief now knows her splendors A crook enjoys her clutch  It was a fancy Jetta Volkswagen made, its true I treated her like a sister And kept her looking new  We'd tear around the Avenues And climb up steeply hills The way she handled Lombard Street Would bring Andretti chills  Her seats were oh so comfy They firmly gave support I wish they'd find that criminal I’d testify in court!  I miss my shiny black car Who handled like a dream I miss her glove box where I left A little bag of green  If you ever see the Annika car While taking a little trip Please don’t tell me, no no no I’ll cry if it were stripped  I’d like to find a seer Who's crystal globe would say “It’s there, you are mistaken  Look it’s still parked on Clay!”  Alas, but that can't happen The Annika car is gone It's all my fault, ‘tis I who parked  And left her all alone  So when my Allstate man calls And sends my little check I’ll get a car with a cd changer Instead of an old tape deck  But I’ll still pine for Sweetie My lovely former ride The Annika car I cherished First car I ever buyed  Somebody stole the Annika car Oh mournful, mournful day I wish they hadn’t done it  But sometimes life’s that way  The Annika car’s been stolen It doesn’t seem for real She’s gone but not forgotten The Annika-mobile!

      Behold! For a Giant yet walks the earth. With shoulders of rock, striding forth he wields Thirty-two ounce, thirty-four inches girth Maple Excalibur, from which he deals Four hundred foot jacks, right side of the plate Six hundred home runs, five hundred base steals; Never swings early, nor ever swings late, Inside the box hit, outside the box wait. He cares not for me, and cares not for you Cares not a whit for the bat when he’s through, And straightening up, and seeing the view Watches the ball fly until it’s a dot, And then, only then, begins he his trot Don’t say to him “bring it” – it will be brought.

      scented candles i’ve lit encircle our bodies on the floor and clothes, our mantles, lost balled up against the door  do it slow, so it will last my angel, my devil, my love my eyes, my soul, my hands, they tell what i’m thinking of  a salty drop suspended from your nose, my lips to taste my hand on the nape of your neck wet thighs caress your waist  you slide within me, growing feel it, how you make me shake since that night when i touched your hand i've needed to quench this one ache  my eyes follow yours, unblinking i trace the curve of your calf with my toe and you find the spot you were seeking while this room spins around me so  slowly the pleasure, our rhythm it’s feeding your hunger, my lust sweat covers my belly, my breasts and my hips as I mirror your thrust  sweet muffled cry, twin groans a gasp, and then, i shriek my sighs, my tears, my lips soft breath, too short to speak  your milkiness warm in my body we kiss gently, i whisper, you smile and this room that was spinning so madly returns to the earth for a while  my senses numb, i’m still tingling embracing your strength and your weight and shifting my body just slightly we go again on this night, so so late

      At the edge of a deep Verdant crevasse The hissing ocean so far below Barely seen this morning Through the fog  Cool gentle breeze, and  Green strands among blue waves Of the pacific, sea of forgetfulness Calming spirit and mind As you sit waiting  Pale rays of gold The sun from your left Warms your arm and lights This contented respite On your journey south  Sailing through the mist Wings teetering, acute dihedrals Vultures float like seraphim Two hundred feet beneath Your outdoor table, where  You eat your nine dollar hamburger And quaff o’ quaff this diet coke

      Hunger and the steep hills trumped fear of the shits and so, stepping through the door of a crowded  tiny mercado de fruta I waited, fingering two bright hard nectarines Euro in hand and searching  my best Portuguese for “bom dia” and “obrigado.”  The sticky juices and nowhere to wipe my hands.

      I used to temp in a large law office While there I noticed that A lot of time was spent And wasted by employees Walking around the office From desk to copier Coffee maker to supply room Water cooler to bathroom or Soda machine or faxer So I invented a device So that such time could be made useful Consisting of a tin strap Worn as a headband and two Sturdy metal alligator clamps Attached by hinged arms Designed to hold a paperback Or sheaf of papers suspended In front of one's eyes and read While walking to and fro Around the office I tested the contraption And aside from a few mishaps  Wherein I walked into walls Or knocked over an object or two Or three, It worked perfectly However, to my surprise, No one wanted to buy my invention And so I continued to work there Until subsequently, I was let go For reasons unrelated to my ingenuity And instead of becoming a rich entrepreneur I ended up in grad school.

      Oh Sevilla, Within your arms I dreamt, While a thousand stars lay above me  And your night's air, Hot and sultry as a sin, Intoned your feverish call  Like so many piercing needles. I dreamt of lying with him  On this balcony under your stars On a morning just like this, Naked before your pinkening sky, Beyond the walls of la Giralda. And  Then in my dream the stony quiet Of your night became a stage, on which His love for me was born anew.  And with each gentle sigh we floated As if we were two feathers blown Along your streets of ochre. White  And blue azulejos drifted by us. The washerwomen with their baskets Lowered their eyes and smiled. Oh Sevilla, your red rose petals,  soft as fallen tears, and a solitary guitar-song, were all you left for me when I awoke Alone, Sevilla, where I dreamt of him.

      And can we trust the words of healing yet?  You at your couch's end and i on mine.  Earnest spoken, hand in hand and time, Who's vision i once held but never met.   Apologies for strident burning words.  Phone calls that ended. Dying. Strangers. Hate.  And shall a trust befriend a gift of fate.  The half-lit rainbow beckons timid birds.  i put away my weeping, my black eyes No longer the mascara daily smears. i put away the weeping and the tears  Of daily lonely sufferings and sighs.   And shall this box be opened yet again?  A heart that's once laid barren is estopped. A love that once lay open is a knot That words of healing pry fore'er in vain.

      In Sevilla there is a little square hidden in the maze of streets around a dark statue of Don Juan known as la plaza de Santa Cruz. If you go there find the show at Los Gallos: four beautiful men and four beautiful women dancing flamenco and singing with multicolored dress and  black silk. Drink sangria, close your eyes, and listen to the sharp stomp of boots and the staccato clapping of  bearded men. Watch the hands of the se&#241;orita, the one who will not meet your gaze, and the swagger of the tall man with long hair, color of the raven, who will.

      Gandhi lives on at La Guardia even If only in the traveler's feet.  A golden car blocks the path Of taxis anxious to complete  The circuits of a changeless pattern: Brooklyn, Midtown, BQE.  The cab driver rolls his window down Jawing, he lets the horns bleat   Behind him, speaking truth to power. A modern day  satyagrahi .  Gandhi might have driven on, Sagacious, in his driver's seat.

      O green striped rod so warm in my hand, ringed by gold,  and black capped, screwed on or off. Plunge you, i do, into your azure bath of darkest liquor,  wherefor to quench your thirsty tip. Then lovingly i wipe  clean the leaky dew from your gleaming  golden head. May i hold you to my parting lips as i ponder  a newer note? My pelikan, my love, what pleasure you bring! i will stroke you lightly and only across  the cleanest, whitest sheets.

      O Arby's drive-thru guy you are the best, Not like those slackers at Taco Bell or Jack's. And we who grace your window know we're blessed: You'll get our orders right, we can relax. When speaking through the intercom i hear Your friendly smile that lets me know you care; If not for me, a nameless customer, Then for my sandwich, a Coke and fries to share. You wear your short-sleeved Arby's shirt with pride Because you clearly speak, not grunt nor mumble (When reading back my order 'ere i ride), And 'cause the food is good you nee'n't be humble. Ah, would that all life's joys one could rely On so steadfastly as you, O Arby's guy.
