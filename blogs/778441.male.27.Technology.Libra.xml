      I went home really late yesterday i.e. Thursday. Well, actually, I wanted to leave early... but this freaking (grrrr!!) Linux problem kept me here till pretty late. So, when I left for home, I decided to call up mom & dad at home and tell them I was gonna be really late. I got into the bus and dialed home on my cell. The phone could ring only two times and then my cellphone went on the blink! ... batteries drained out, u see!  :-| So, there I was... stuck in that stupid 411 (thats the bus I was taking for going home) in a traffic jam at 9:30 in the evening. I finally reached home at 10:30 PM. Mom and dad (and sis too!) were worried. I usually never go home late without informing them... so thats why! Anyways, since I got home late, I ate my dinner late and so I slept late. Then it was obvious that I would get up late today morning. And I did indeed get up pretty late. Well, late by my standards... I got up at 6:00 AM  *LOL* Today was again a frustrating day at the office. The damned Linux problem doesn't seem to go away. I fought with it for the entire day. But no luck :-| More about it later... thats it for now!! :-) cheers!

      watta day!! ... absolutely frustrating! Been tryin' to set up a network card on a linux box and like a stubborn mule, the machine refuses to accept that card. I dunno where time fled during the day... I was just so involved in this thing! Ahh! ... this is getting too technical... not a very good thing, is it?! ;-) Umm... lets see what else happened...   Ahhh yes! ... it was a great day for India at the  urlLink Commonwealth Games  yesterday. Not so much in the amount of golds/silvers that we got... but the kind of wins that we achieved yesterday were phenomenal. Aparna Popat's win over top-seed Permana of Australia, Indian boxers' domination of their opponents, few more golds in weightlifting. But yesterday's greatest win was the one that the women's hockey team achieved over the South Africans. The South Africans were leading 3-0 at half-time. Then early in the 2nd half, India scored, but were 2 goals behind for the major part of the half. In the last 10 mins, the Indians launched a blitzkreig and scored two quick goals that broke South Africans' backs. The match went into extra time which has the Golden goal rule. In the dying moments of trhe first half of extra time, an innocuous looking push by a South African on a comparatively diminutive Indian girl led to a penalty corner. With the clock having ticked over into half time, the Indians slammed in the penalty corner to complete a remarkable game. I rate this win on par with India's historic win over England in the Natwest trophy finals on 13th July 2002 at Lords. Hats off to the Indian women's hockey team!! Oops!! ... too much blabbering!! I HAVE to get this Linux box set up correctly. So, I'll take your leave for the moment and get back to work.... but darn!! ... AC's stopped working... and its become much too stuffy for my liking... :-( Anyways... ciao! ;-)

      sheesh!! ... just came back from a loooong meeting. It was a presentation  -  thoroughly technical. I had some difficulty keeping myself from drifting away into slumberland. Now I'm gonna go to the gym and get down to some serious working out. I've been away from the gym for nearly a month now and I'm sure my arms will be like jelly after about 30 minutes in the gym. But then, as they say... no gain without pain!! Or is it the other way round?... I never know! hahaha There's a tiny devil sitting on my left shoulder who is telling me to forget about going to the gym, but the little fella in white and with a halo over his head sitting on my right shoulder says that working out is good for me!! ...rats!! ... choices!! oh well!!... the good fell won! ... I'm going to the gym. bbye :-)

      Hello world!! Greetings from the new kid on the blog! ;-) This is my first ever blog and I hope to post new blogs pretty regularly. Now how regular is "pretty regularly" is pretty much a debatable thing. But I do hope that it will really be "pretty regular"!! Confused?!! ... Great!... that WAS my intention. ;-) ha ha ha!! ... so I hope you people will visit this place "regularly" (groan... not again!!!) and have an inside view of my mind ... which can be quite chaotic at times! :-) so long folks! ... be seein' you! take care. cheers! - Sam

      I'm trying to change the layout a bit... nothing fancy.. just a slight change :-) Hope to have it ready soon!! Oh yes... the second cricket Test between India and England starts today at Trentbridge. I hope Indians perform well in this test match. Thats because my moods move with the fortunes of the Indian team. Which is why you'll find me sullen and grumpy most of the time!! ;-)  (blame the Indian cricket team for that! *LOL*). So, if there's anyone in the world who wants me to be happy, then pray that the Indian team does well ... hahahaha!! :-P ok ... so more later in the day! cheers!! :-)

      I had just been to the canteen downstairs. And it started raining quite a lot. The canteen has a transparent roof (translucent atually! ... for the people who like to do nitpicking on semantics). So, the rain splashing merrily on the roof was a great sight (and made a not-too-bad sound too!! *LOL*).  All this rain has certainly brought down the temperatures in Mumbai (Bombay, for those who don't know that they are one and the same!). So, it was wonderful to sit in the canteen with the heavy downpour outside, a chill in the air and eating steaming stuff! :-) So there... having eaten, I'm now ready to face another gruelling travel back home. But you people just pray that I reach home fast. Spending four hours travelling back from work isn't how I like to spend my evenings!! ... (even for a self-confessed geek that I am!!) ;-) So long... I gotta move my butt out of this place before it starts to pour again... bye!

      Man!!... I had a great time reaching home yesterday. With all the rain that we've had in Mumbai yesterday, it took me 4 hrs from door to door... that is definitely a new record! But I don't wanna create such records... noooo wayyy!! I left the office at 7 PM and reached Andheri station at arnd 10:20 PM... a distance usually covered in just abt 30 mins. It was reaaaallllly frustrating at first sitting in the company bus, stuck in the traffic. But then the alternatives weren't very attractive either. Walking (or rather... wading) thru knee deep water isn't my cup of tea... especially given the state of Mumbai roads (you never know when you might step into an open gutter!). Well, so I slept for the first hour... and then didn't know what to do. All I could do was to look outside the bus and pity the souls who had to walk since their cars, cabs, autorickshaws simply could not continue through the flooded streets (you see it was so flooded that the cars were sunk in that water upto their bonnets!!) There were a couple of funny scenes though! At one signal, two cars (both Marutis... one an 800, the other a Zen) had conked off right in the middle of the traffic jammed road. Mechanics were working furiously under the bonnets trying to get them going. There was a huuuge truck stuck right behind these cars. The truck driver was honking and abusing away to glory! *LOL* Another scene involved a Sumo, an Indica and an autorickshaw. The Indica was stuck between the Sumo and the auto. Suddenly the Sumo lurched forward and struck the Indica's rear bumper. The Indica propelled forward by the impact crashed into the autorickshaw's behind. What followed was a royal abusing match beween all the three drivers and the occupants! ... The loudest of them was an elderly lady from the Indica. She was shouting the choicest and the most unheard of profanities in a loud and shrill voice. It was too funny! Finally... reached Andheri station at arnd 10:20 PM. The bus driver was kind enuf to drop us at Andheri West so that we coudl just jump into the station without having to walk on the flooded road on the eastside. The, got the fast local almost immediately and finally reached home at arnd 11 PM. Mom was waiting for me... she had not eaten dinner yet (very very sweet of her!!). So, I got to end the day with a nice hot, steaming dinner!! ... ummmm! yay!! Oh yes, Ashwini reached Bangalore right on time. Sunanda (her friend) picked her up from the station. It seems they went to see Bend it like Beckham in the evening. Thats one great movie. I definitely recommend it strongly!! ... even if you like soccer or don't! ;-) Well... I guess thats it for now! Cheers! :-)

      Yesterday, I had talked about how bad Saturday was and claimed that Sunday was even more awful. Well now, you judge for yourself! *LOL* Since I couldn't make it on time on Saturday, I couldn't go shopping with Ashwini. So, it got carried over to Sunday. As it happened, the rain gods decided to have 'mercy' on us 'Mumbaikars' and opened the taps to their fullest. It really rained cats and dogs (... and pigs and cows and horses ...). There wasn't a full minute all morning when the rain had halted completely. So, when it slowed down somewhat, we left home for shopping. The roads were waterlogged at places and it made driving difficult. About halfway to the shop, I felt something was not right with the clutch pedal... there was wayyy too much play in it. As usual, my spidey sense tingled *LOL* but I promptly chose to ignore it. Just a little further down the road, when I was waiting at a red-light, I realized that the clutch was sadly no more! I tried to put the car into gear, but without the assistance of the clutch, the gear stick remained stuck in the neutral position and I found myself stuck in the middle of the road. As, I furiously tried to bring the car into first gear, cars, buses, trucks started honking behind me!! In the confusion, I dunno how the gear slipped into the 'reverse' position and then refused to budge from there. I got out of the car and tried to push the car to the side of the road. Consider for a moment, the situation I was in... stuck in the middle of the main road with a stalled car, trying to push it while at the same time trying to be oblivious to the cacophony of horns and abuses from the drivers stuck behind my car. To this add a heavy downpour... and that should make my misery very clear to you!! ;-)

      I wanted to write something on saturday itself, but my laziness did not allow me to do that! anyways... they say that its better late than never! ;-) well, I just had the most amazing wekend! I just couldn't put a foot right for the last three days. I had become somewhat of a reverse Midas... I mean everything I touched, flopped!! This Linux problem that I've been talking about in my last few blogs has almost succeeded in driving me insane. As I told a friend, the only thing that remained to be done was to climb on the desk and tear out my hair in disgust and frustration!! *LOL* Saturday was ruined due to this problem. I had to go shopping with Ashwini (my sis!) in the evening. But the rains and the (in)famous Mumbai roads ganged up and it took me more time to reach my home from the office, than it takes for me to drive all the way to Pune!! well... if saturday was a bitch! ... Sunday was the mother of all bitches in the world! ... but more about it in some time... ;-) cheers!

      Heyyy! ... its India's 55th Independence Day today! ... Long live India! I am really proud to be an Indian and I'm sure so are the millions of Indians across the world!  So, I had a holiday today. Spent it at home... relaxing completely! I did nothing... nothing at all, the entire day... slept... listened to radio  (these new FM channels are great!)  ... ate home-cooked meals  (something I miss when I'm at the workplace) ... and slept some more! *LOL*   Well, finally in the evening I went to this new supermarket which has opened recently at Phoenix Mills compound. Its called Big Bazaar. And boy!... is it BIG!!! ... just too damn big and today being a holiday... it was just too damn crowded! Checked out a few things there... a new Nokia model  (a cell-phone model, I must specify!)  caught my eye. It was loaded with features and was good looking too! ... but I wasn't loaded with cash and so I deferred buying it. But I liked it a lot! :-)  The I went to Planet M which is just next door to this Big Bazaar. It was supposed to be Planet M's 3rd anniversary. I picked up a few casettes n CDs...  (bought a casette of Bombay Dreams... Rehman has supposedly outdone himself in this album... will have to check it out!) . I also bought a computer game... its been a long time since I bought one! :-)  So, all in all... not a bad day!... and just one day to go for the weekend to arrive!! :-))  Ok... so I guess thats it for now!  cheers!!   ... and oh yes! ... if you want to check out some of my scribblings  (my pseudo 'literary' efforts!!) , then you will find them on the links on the control panel to the right of the page! ;-)

      I was happy yesterday. Ashwini returned from Bangalore and was very happy to have spent a week with her friend. It was great to have her back. Makes the home complete! :-)   Indians played some great cricket on the last day at Trentbridge in Nottinghamshire (correct me if I'm wrong here! ... I mean the location of TrentBridge). The big three, Sachin, Saurav and Dravid fired when the chips were down and ensured that India stays in the hunt in the series by drawing the Test match. Great work guys! ... Keep it up!! ... Added to it was the fact that the other players...  i.e. the famous Indian tail , played dogged cricket which was dour at times but always effective! Agarkar is improving by leaps and bounds as a batsamn and thats good news! The kid in the team (17 yr old Parthiv Patel) showed guts to stick it out till the end.   What else?! ... nothing much from the personal front! ... apart from that... ummmm... oh yes! ... India got a brand new Vice-President yesterday. Bhairon Singh Shekhawat of BJP is the new VP.   Well, I joined the Proud 2 B Indian clique. Its homepage is at  urlLink http://www.freewebs.com/proudindian . Seems like a nice idea! And with India's Independence Day approaching fast  (15th August) , it seemed very timely too!! :-)   Anyways, thats it for now. cheers!

      Last friday's blog said something about a presentation. Well, it went off smoothly... smoother than I expected it to! But the scary thing was I kept on seeing some slides for the first time when they are projected on the big screen, and then I had to make up some explanation for that slide. It was quite hilarious actually! Thank god, I managed to make it through te presentation unscathed!!   *LOL*   The weekend was quite relaxed. In fact much too relaxed! I spent the evenings over the weekend trying to put together this layout. Otherwise it was absolutely laidback. I watched the cricket match on TV and the Indians disappointed (like they usually do!) :-(   Today was quite a nice day actually, considering the fact that it is Monday! ;-) ... I managed to get the new layout up and running. I managed to crack that Linux problem that was bugging me like hell for the last few days. I managed to get through the day without having anybody burst out laffing seeing my new haircut (I look pretty funny with the hair as they r 2de!). I also managed to stay awake through the entire day  (something that I'm not known to be able achieve!)  ;-)   Plus Indians are playing extremely well on the last day and are well on their way to save the Test match. They may or may not be able to do that... but it sure makes me feel good that they are at least fighting it out! Hope they save the match! ...  Amen   By the way... its way past the time I usually leave for home. But today, I've to go to the airport to pick up Ashwini (my sis, if you've forgotten already!), whose coming back from Bangalore. The plane's scheduled to arrive at 22:20 IST. But given the great Indian tradition of never being on time... I'm not so sure about the arrival time. So... thats it for the day. This is Sameer signing off from Mumbai for  urlLink http://supersam5.blogspot.com . See you again tomorrow... bye!!  cheers!! ;-)

       New Layout's here!  ...  *LOL*  So, I finally managed to get some time over the weekend to change my layout. And here is the result!! ...  *drumrolls and claps*  ha ha ha!! I picked up this layout (Eric Costello's design) from  urlLink http://glish.com/css . So thanx mate! Anyways, I made a few changes in the layout by integrating all the supporting files into one big  html  file bcos like blogger does not allow webspace to upload any extra files. :D  I really need to get my weblog hosted! ;) Anyways, did you notice that this layout changes colours dynamically!! ... and whats more everytime you reload it... it loads with a different colour scheme. And, it also gives you an option to customize the page to your liking, by giving you some cutomization options  (look in the control panel on the right of the page to find those customization options)  Sooo... that it for now! ... will be back later with today's blog! cheers!

       Not more than a few words...  Ok, so after a couple of days of really huge blogs, I'm gonna say just a few words today!  (mainly bcos I don't have much to say!!)   Indians played some great cricket yesterday on the first day and managed to lose just two wickets. Though the score wasn't too great at the end of the day, we still have Rahul Dravid  (batting well past the hundred run mark) and Sachin Tendulkar at the crease and that is just great! I hope they continue the good work on the second day.  Well, in the morning today, I came across a news report on  urlLink Rediff  which broke the news that a key witness to the Godhra train carnage in Gujarat had testified. His testimony was a sensational one which gave a blow-by-blow account of what transpired at the Godhra railway station that led to the burning of coach S6 of the Sabarmati Express. It was this gruesome incident that sparked off the communal riots in Gujarat that killed hundreds of people and rendered thousands homeless, earlier this year. You can read the news of this chilling testimony by clicking  urlLink here .   Anyways, nothing much happened for the rest of the day... I visited  urlLink Mae 's website and quite liked it. Her website is so interactive... I mean, nearly all the pages have feedback facility. Plus, I liked her views on various subjects she has chosen to comment on.  Ummm... what else!!?... ahhh I just can't think of anything to write about!!. Do I detect the onset of another bout of  urlLink writer's block ?!!... I hope not!...  *LOL*   And ohh!... I'll be travelling to Pune early tomorrow morning. Most probably, I would be spending the weekend at our new house in Pune. I am crazy about driving on the Mumbai-Pune expressway  (after all, where else can you get a road so beautiful in India) . So, I'm looking forward to the drive to and back from Pune. But I won't be able to access the Net while in Pune... so no blogging during the weekend!  Ha ha!! ... this didn't turn out to be the mini-blog that I thought it would be!!  Ok... so good bye folks! ... have a great weekend!!  Cheers!

       Controversies, festivals and the mean streak running through me...  The Indian cricket team starts the third cricket test match against England at Headingly today. In fact, the match has just started off ... i.e. at 10:00 AM GMT (thats exactly 1530 hrs IST). England are boosted by the return of two of their better bowlers, Caddick and Tudor  (though Gough hasn't recovered from injury) . Indians, on the other hand have been having problems with their seamers and had to drop Ashish Nehra  (very talented but careless bowler) . I am surprised that SS Das wasn't included in the side especially after he hit a double century in the practice game last week.Strange!... Anyways, I wouldn't blame the team. They've had a nightmarish time in the last few days.   Its all bcos of this controversy involving the International Cricket Council ( urlLink ICC ) and their sponsorship deals. It seems the ICC signed a contract with their sponsors for some major cricket tournaments like the Champions Trophy  (in September '02)  and the World Cup  (next year) . Well, the contract had a clause which said that none of the players from any teams will not be able to endorse any brands other than those of the tournament sponsors. Now, this isn't an evil clause per se. But, you see, a lot of cricketers have personal contracts for endorsing various brands. So, the clause in the ICC contract clashes with the personal contracts of the players. Even this isn't much of a problem on its own. But the real point is that ICC signed this contract in 2000 and the players have been made aware of this clause only less than a month before the Champions Trophy starts. Thats why the players revolted and said that they will not sign the contract which will enable them to be available for selection for the team that plays the Champions Trophy tournament early next month. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on its part is desperately trying to find some middle ground in this dispute and ensure that all the star players appear in the Champions Trophy matches.  The point is... with all these  off-the-field  activities, its difficult to expect the players to be able to focus on the job they know best, i.e. play cricket. Well, anyways, lets see what happens as this Test match unfolds!  I think I have bored you enough with all this cricket talk. But, I can't help it... I just love the game!...  *LOL*   By the way, today's  Raksha Bandhan  as I mentioned in my blog yesterday. So, early morning... we had this little ceremony at home in the morning. Ashwini tied this really cute  Rakhi  on my wrist and I gave her sweets and a little present. Then, we had lots of those sweets...  lots!! . Anyways, this rakhi is great!... its got a very tiny peacock feather  (I suspect its not a real feather... so all you PETA oriented people can relax!) . The point is... its so good that I kept my sleeves rolled up the whole day just to show off the Rakhi...  LOL   And then, today morning, I played a prank on  urlLink Richa . It was all done in good humour. And I bet she had a great time calling me a   big meanie  ... ha ha ha!! ... but I couldn't help it... I'm an idiot!!  (well, not a complete idiot yet, there're still some parts missing!)  :-))   By the way, I just came across a great anti-smoking sign  (I got it by email from one of my friends) ... It says...    "Thank you for Not Smoking -- Cigarette smoking is the residue of your pleasure. It contaminates the air, pollutes my hair and clothes, not  to mention my lungs. This takes place without my consent. I have a pleasure, too. I like a beer now and then. The residue of my pleasure is urine. Would you be annoyed if I stood on a chair and pissed on your head and your clothes without your consent?"    Good one, isn't it?!!  well, that brings to an end another one of my huge blogs... I think I'm getting too verbose!! ... What do you ppl think?! ... Just let me know through the comments. Thank God,  urlLink enetation.co.uk  has started working now  (it gave me lot of grief in the last few days) . Ok, so... thats it for now, I guess... unless I sneak off like yesterday and do some karting/bowling or stuff like that... *LOL*.  cheers!

      I just did something absolutely wicked!  he he he!!   We're currently lightly loaded as far as work goes... so few of us here in the office decided to sneak out and enjoy a go-karting session. So, we did just that! ... We ran off to this go-karting circuit at Hiranandani in Powai and did a few laps of the circuit there. Enjoyed it tremendously!! It was a great relief from the monotony of work. Added to it was the fact that I managed the best timings yet again!...  *grinning widely*   And then... there was this movie being shot near the karting circuit. They were shooting a fight sequence with lots of overturned and trashed cars and stuff like that. Anil Kapoor was the hero... and he was sitting under an umbrella wearing a yellow jersey which had seen better days. A makeup-man was putting touches of fake blood on his clothes and face. Suddenly, Anil Kapoor got up and simply walked around the set checking out the lighting and stuff. There was a roar from the crowd gathered to see the shooting... they all started cheering him, u see! ...  LOL .  Well, just bcos of this shooting, we had to take a detour to reach the circuit. So, when we took the detour and passed this movie set from the rear side, we could see lots of dummies lying strewn on the road. It must be a pretty violent scene that they were shooting... with dummies flying out of crashing cars and all! ... ha ha ha ... that's Bollywood for you!!  Okay... so thats it for now! :-)... cheers!

       Musical delights and a short trip down the memory lane...  I wanted to do some blogging yesterday, but there was some international carrier failure on our ISP's links and so Net access was on and off  (OFF for most part!) , so no I just couldn't blog. Finally, frustrated, i gave up trying to connect and so passed Tuesday without any blog from me! ...  There! ... I got that off my chest!!  ;-)  By the way, I'm currently listening to this CD...  Party At The Palace . It is the live recording of the Queen's Golden Jubilee concerts at the Buckingham Palace on 3rd June 2002. It has some absolutely fab tracks  (well actually, all the tracks are top class) . I just finished hearing Shirley Bassey belt out  Goldfinger . Wow! this lady has an amazing voice even now. Ohh... currently I am hearing Tom Jones mischievously crooning  You can leave your hat on .  just grrrrreat!!   Today, its been exactly 4 years since I started working.  Four years?!! ... I just can't imagine how time fled. I still remember my first day at work like it was just a couple of weeks back. Fresh out of college, sluggish after a long vacation, eager to do well, and without any friends or acquaintences in the company, I joined a batch of trainees just like me. I also remember the lectures/talks that the company's top honchos came down to give to us. After delivering an induction speech, the CEO paused to take questions. There was a few moments of silence in which all of us looked at each other not knowing what to ask or say...  (after all he was the damn CEO of the company... and well, we were just a bunch of geeky greenhorns) . So, finally after an uneasy period of silence, a frail, timid sort of a fellow raised his hand, stood up and asked the CEO, "Excuse me sir, but could you please direct me to the men's room?" ... We just about burst out laughing!! ... well what else could we do!  ... well right now its Joe Crocker singing  With a little help from my friends  ... ummm... great song!  Ok, so today morning I sent emails to all my batchmates congratulating them all on completing 4 years. I'm in touch with few of them. The others have drifted away due to work pressures and other such compulsions. And, I've got a great deluge of replies from all of them. I feel just great hearing from them after a long long time!  But apart from hearing from friends, I don't really have any emotional feelings about having completed 4 years. In fact I feel  Comfortably Numb , to quote Pink Floyd. ;-)  Anyways, tomorrow is  Raksha Bandhan , a hindu festival which occurs on the first Full Moon day in the Hindu month of Shravana. If you want some historical significance of this festival, you can get it by clicking  urlLink here . Ok, so I should remember to take some sweets while going home today, bcos tomorrow morning Ashwini will tie the Rakhi on my wrist and I'll have to give her sweets in return ...  (actually, I'll give more than just sweets... but sweets are important. I can't afford to forget buying them today!) . :-)  ... arrite!! ... last song on the CD now...  Hey Jude  by Paul McCartney. The crowd at the Buckingham palace, I can hear on the CD,  just went wild during the song!! :-)  Okay! ... so thats it for now, folks! ... I'll be back tomorrow with something more to blog about. Hope I didn't bore you! :-)  Cheers!

       Monday Blues and musings on the weekend...  So today's Monday ... and a start of another week so to speak!!  Traditionally, the world over, Mondays are regarded as an unnecessary evil. Something that somehow has to end the blissful joy of a wonderful thing known as a 'weekend'. What a pity that Mondays come once every week! ... but on the other hand what good fortune that Mondays don't come along more than once a week.  What am I speaking about?! ... I'm sure most of you would infer from these statements that I've taken leave of my senses and I am just blabbering to fill up the space and to hog some bandwidth. In a way you would be right. Mondays do that to me!! After a relaxed couple of days, when I get up on a Monday morning, I find that many of my faculties are yet to wake up from the slumber... and so they stay in a dormant state throughout the day. Only the ability to get irritated is up and kicking. So, if you catch me on a Monday, don't worry, I'm quite a likeable guy on other days of the week.  To add some insult to injury, I found that  urlLink tag-board.com  messed up their act during the weekend and swallowed up few of the messages from my tagboard. Plus,  urlLink enetation.co.uk  was also offline for most of the weekend and so that meant no one who came to this site were able to comment. In short, the feedback mechanism on my blog site was f****d up over the weekend.  By the way, the weekend went off pretty well. Saturday was pretty relaxed for most of the part. In the evening though, my sis, Ashwini dragged me along to this place in Bandra called Globus. There was some sale going on over there.  (It really is a mystery to me how the word 'Sale' attracts females. And I'm sure this is a global phenomenon. I definitely need somebody to explain to me why this is so.) . After a tortuous couple of hours, Ashwini could not find anything to her liking and I ended up buying everything from undies to shirts and everything in between! God bless my sister! ... she bought me a pair of trousers! Anyways, I strongly suspect that the reason that I bought so many things for myself was the pretty assistant in the store who cheerfully helped me in my shopping! I'm glad that her friends called her for a coffee break otherwise I would have run up a lot more credit on my card! ;-)  They were showing  Dil Chahta Hai  on Star Plus on Saturday and I must say, I never get tired of seeing that movie. Its just too damn funny and touching at the same time. Great debut film by Farhan Akhtar. He's surely destined for greater things!  Sunday was one more wasted day. Wasted, if you consider good old dozing off as wasting the day! ;-)  Nothing much happened in the evening either. The Hungarian F1 GP was being shown live on TV and I didn't have the enthusiasm to watch it. Normally I am a huge F1 and follow each race religiously. But this year, somehow, I get bored watching Ferrari win race after race without any competition from either BMW or McLaren. So, out of sheer boredom I surfed the net. While surfing I realized that I have an account on tripod and therefore I can put up my site there. So, I sat down to do just that. I'll probably have that site up and running in a few days time.  And oh yes! ... English Premier League kicked off this weekend and so now the evenings on weekends will have some purpose! ;-) Last year I rooted for Arsenal and it won. This year I have yet to decide my favourite team. But Arsenal looked awesome in their first outing against Birmingham. On the other hand Man U and Liverpool just about managed to get past their opponents.  Wow... this must be the longest blog ever from me!! ... I guess I have to wind up now. So, bye then... till next time!  Cheers!

       The joke's on me!  Ok... here's something about myself that I  re -discovered today. I realized  (while joggin on the treadmill and looking aimlessly into the wall-2-wall mirror)  that I get dimples on both my cheeks when I smile in a particular way.  *LOL*  As I've mentioned... it was just a re-discovery. But all the same, I filed away this discovery in my brain for use later in situations that might demand showing off my dimpled cheeks  (the cheeks of my face... to be precise!)  ;-)   Then, there's this conversation that I had today with one of my colleagues. We were talking about people who make sad jokes or groaners  (or  PJ s, as they are called in India) . I argued that it takes a special ability to crack a groaner. I mean, what is a groaner or a real sad joke anyways?! ... It is... seeing the most obvious aspect of any situation or a word and turning it around to make it humorous. Since, this humour is often based on the most trivial aspects of any situation, people fail to appreciatethe humour and either the humour falls flat or the listener cracks up with laughter and curses the person, who cracked the joke, for being so trivial.   Quite often, such sad jokes are pun based. Now, it is a known fact that punning is almost an art form. Most of our literary giants could pun at will. So, did these guys have such a low sense of humour?!!  I'm reminded of one  Issac Asimov  story in which he told about a person called, Sloane. Now, Sloane had a pet rock  (remember this is a Science Fiction story... so anything goes! ... even pet rocks who can move!!) . This pet rock was called Teddy. And since it was quite common to have pet rocks, their owners often entered them into racing competitions  (just like they have greyhound racing or rabbit racing, etc.) . So, once in a race Sloane entered his rock. Now, once the race started, all the other rocks started moving towards the finish line. Only, Teddy did not budge. Sloane begged, pleaded and cajoled Teddy to move... but to no avail. Finally, Sloane offered Teddy something to eat... but only if he moved. Now, Teddy was a special rock... he could move very fast  (almost lightening fast) . So, when the other rocks were close to the finish line... Teddy made his move and dashed across the finish line before any other rock could! It was amazing... everybody cheered and clapped and congratulated Sloane and his rock. The headline in the local newspaper read the next day...  "Sloane's Teddy wins the race"    A classic punny story that was!  Anyways, you people put in your thoughts on this in the comments.  Aaahhhhh! ... I'm in this weird situation here! My head isn't aching... but it has grown sooo heavy that it feels as though it might just slump to the side if I tilt it even a little bit! I'm sure I'm gonna get up with a splitting headache and a choked nose tomorrow morning. Ugghhh! ... I hate that!  Well... okay... what else's new?! ... Ahh yes! ...  urlLink Amrita  has got a new domain and she's moved all her sites to the new domain. Thats really really grrr8 news, Amrita!! ... See what happens when you dedicate blogs to me! ;-)   *LOL*   Thats it for now from my side... I guess!... Ciao folks!  cheers!

       Happy days are here again!  I've had absolutely no time to blog today!! ... been busy most of the day and then I had to attend this seminar in the afternoon. Absolutely bullshit... it was! ...dunno why I even attended it  (I had a sneaking suspicion that it was gonna be a crappy session!) . Then I went to the gym... and just returned from there!  While on the topic of working out... It seems I just overdid a few exercises a wee bit yesterday. It being my first visit to the gym after a gap of 2 months, my whole body started aching in the night. And I woke up this morning like an egyptian mummy... totally stiff in all the joints!!  *LOL*   You know... I couldn't even raise my hand to my mouth to brush my teeth ... I had to raise my arm halfway and then lowered my head a little so that my teeth and the brush met midway... and my teeth got cleaned.  But things improved during the day... and by the evening, I could dare to go back to the gym and have another session of workout! ;-)  Well, as I said yesterday, its been a great day for me... with  urlLink Tristorm.org  elevating me to  Star Site  and even  urlLink Amrita  dedicating her blog to me. I'm getting to be quite the popular guy.  *LMAO*   By the way... Congrats to Amrita for passing her driving test. Now, Mumbai has one more qualified driver! ... ;-)   Anyways, I got my look-alike  (well, at least to some extent, he looks like me... but some people might not agree!)  done at  urlLink stor.co.uk . You can see it to the right   ======>    Ok... I guess thats it for now... bye!  cheers!

       I'm the Fat Cat  Quite an uneventful day, today!  I casually happened to look into a full-length mirror and believe me I am not joking, I nearly let out a gasp. Instead of seeing a lean, mean, muscular torso  (*LOL*... I wish!!) , all I saw was the onset of a tyre developing around my waist. *eeeeeks* .  Its funny how a honest look in the mirror provides an unbeatable incentive to resume the daily workouts in the gym. It was just a glance in the mirror in the morning that did what a lot of coaxing and cajoling from friends could not do. So, here I am... resolute in my resolve to start going to the gym from today  *LOL* . I only hope this doesn't turn out to be like those new-year resolutions  (well, to be honest, I haven't broken the only resolution that I made at the start of this year. So, I'm not too bad at sticking to the decisions I make... or so I like to think!) . But, the freeloader that I am, I'm just gonna use the company gym rather than pay up an astronomical amount to some gym (some time back, I used to think that paying huge fees to gyms would prove to be incentive enough for me to refrain from slacking off w.r.t. the workouts in the gym)   Oh well... with workouts come diets and I hate going on diets as you all already must have realized from one of my articles  (link's available in the control panel, to the right) .  And, mom had made an absolutely delightful  sabzi  made from mushrooms n spring onions. mmmm... the tangy taste of that excellent preparation is still lingering on my tongue  (don't worry, I did rinse my mouth after the lunch!)  ;-)  Ummm... what else happened today?!...  *sheeeesh*  ... nothing happens around here! ... I'm such a boring guy!  *LOL*   Well, yours truly got a  Star Site  rating at  urlLink Tristorm.org .  (I have this broad smile on my face right now!) . Thanks a ton Abe!! :-)  Hey, now I really got to run off to the gym! As someone has said...  Procrastination killed the enthusiasm ... well, to be frank, nobody said that... it was just me! ;-) So, the point is... I should haul my butt to the gym and resume my love-affair with the treadmill and the dumbbells. ;-)  Okay... thats it for now... see you all again tomorrow!   cheers!

       Robbery in the Oxford of the East and other Corny Tales  Greetings to y'all! ... I hope you had a wonderful weekend and are having a great Monday! ;-)   I had an absolutely action-packed weekend. It was much more than I had bargained for...  *LOL*   As I had said in my previos blog, I was supposed to spend the weekend at Pune. So, I left early morning on Saturday with mom, dad and sis. The drive to Pune was amazing and we did the distance in just over two hours  (thanks in large part to the absolutely wonderful Mumbai-Pune expressway. I just can't stress enough, the joy of driving on that highway) . The entire route was flanked on both sides by a verdant heaven. Rains have spun a little bit of magic along the route. There are waterfalls, streams and brooks bubbling merrily along the way, the trees are dense with bright green leaves and the ground is covered in a thick carpet of grass and wildflowers. Absolutely enchanting! ... makes you wanna stop and enjoy a few moments in the company of nature at its very best!  Once we reached Pune, however, we were in for somewhat of a rude shock!  We found that our house was broken into and some stuff stolen!! Now, that was one hell of a nasty surprise! And what a list of things the thieves stole! ... some rice, some cooking oil, some spices  (rather, all the spices that they could find in the house) , some sugar, some tea-powder, a pillow  (they left behind one from the set of two!) , a pillow-case  (just the case, they left the pillow behind) , dishwashing liquid, toilet cleaning liquid and some other weird stuff like this.  Looking at this list of items that were stolen I did not know if I should laugh at the stupidity of the thief or to curse him for the sheer nuisance he made of himself.  Well, you see, the work on the building is still going on and so the painting contractor's workers had been busy painting the outer walls of the building. Our apartment is on the sixth floor and so they had to use harnesses to lower someone to paint outside our flat. So, it seems one of the painters got in through the window and decamped with all this loot.  *LOL*   This incident apart, the weekend went along pretty well. One of the best parts about it was the dinner on Saturday evening. We went to this place called 'Corn Club' and hogged on more dishes made from corn than you can imagine! ... sweet corn soup, corn patties, mexican cheese corn pizza  (I dunno what was it that made it Mexican... but neverthless!) , baby corn fingers, corn  bhel  and a couple of other exotic  corny  treats! ;-)   Sunday was pretty relaxed. The weather in Pune is awesome and I really enjoyed the day doing nothing but sitting in the balcony and feeling the nice, chilly breeze that came from the mountains, not far off!  It was really hard to leave from Pune and come back to Mumbai and face the prospect of another week starting almost immediately. But the prospect of driving on the expressway was also quite good! And did I drive fast!! ... Covered the distance from Pune to Panvel  (thats just outside Mumbai)  in just 90 minutes!! Its an altogether different matter that the freakin' traffic meant that the rest of the distance took another 90 minutes!  *LOL*   'nuff said about the weekend!  Well, today, I got to eat a lot of sweets!... Couple of my colleagues returned from vacations and got back with them some really delicious sweets. I couldn't help but dig into those delicacies  (absolutely disregarding the effect it'll have on my bottomline!!) . As it is, I've had some nice times going on  urlLink diets !  *LOL*   And ohh, today, the Indian cricket team completed a comprehensive win over the English sideby beating them by a huge margin of an innings and 46 runs!!!  (wooo hooo!! ... way to go fellas!!) . So, I'm quite happy about it!  Well, well, well... another Monday is drawing to a close and I can only hope it gets over quickly. I hate Mondays!!  Thats it for now...  cheers!

       A Toothy Tale  This toothache that I have is absolutely driving me nuts. It was just a gentle pain a couple of days back... but now it has grown into an intense throbbing that will just not go away!   Mummmmeeee!!  ... I hate this pain!! ... coz it feels like a sledgehammer slamming on my tooth and the worst part about it is that the pain ripples through to the ear as well...  aaahhhhhh!!  I guess I'll have to start singing ...  Pain Pain go away! ... not-so-little Sammy wants to play!  ;-)  I must... really must  see the dentist... and that too... SOON!! But first... I guess I'll have to search a good dentist near my home. Any suggestions?! ...well,  urlLink Anya  did suggest one... a Dr. Mayekar. But I dunno anything about him except his name. :-)  And I'm sure when I go to the dentist, he or she  as the case may be!  will suggest something drastic like Root Canal or something! ... But considering the size and depth of my cavities, I'm sure the dentist will have to take permission from the National Irrigation Bureau before the work begins on digging the Root  Canal  under my teeth!  *LOL*   Anyways, I guess the visit to the dentist is possible only sometime next week!  Well, I nearly had to go to Pune tomorrow. I mean I was supposed to go... but it got cancelled. I mean my dad will still have to go, but not me! I'll be putting my feet up and spending the weekend lazing about in the house, doing nothing other than growing a heavy stubble and looking like a bum  that, incidently, I am! . With the prospect of being able to watch the Indian batting  (and especially the maestro, Sachin Tendulkar, in his 100th Test match) , I'm pretty excited and sure do hope that the Indians do not let me down. The Englishmen have done exceedingly well on the first day by clobbering the Indian bowlers to all parts of the park. Now it is upto the Indian batsmen to repay the Englishmen in the same coin.   urlLink Richa  has a new layout and I fell in love with it. Aerosmith rawwks!! ...  yeah! ... Grrrrrr8 work Richa!!   urlLink Mae  also got herself a new layout and that too just 2 days after she had put up her old  (well, it can't be called old if it has been up for just 2 days!) ... And I like her layout too... simple and sweet!!  :-)   urlLink Nirav  just set up his blog site and seemed pretty excited about it!... My advice to him would be to stay away from table based layouts. Tables are so unwieldy and messy! ... Nirav, use CSS! :-)  ... lots of stuff to blog about! But no time!! ... been busy! ... I just hope I get to blog during the weekend! But you people leave your comments, views, praises, curses, insults, etc. in the comments box or on the tagboard. All kinds of feedback is welcome!! ... but  psssst  I prefer positive feedback!! ;-)  *LMAO*   Ok people... have to end my monologue now. You all have a great weekend!!   cheers!

      This morning, after logging onto the Net, the first thing I read was  urlLink Abe's  blog. She wrote, at length, about Buddhism and the practice of chanting to have good Karma. I thought it was a great thing to read in the morning...  well, actually a great read at any time of the day! . And it was a nice big blog from her after a really long time. Keep it up, Abe! :-)  Taking a cue from there, I begin today's blog  (ok, so its already begun... so what?!)   Lots of religions in the world have strange rituals and customs. Well, most of them at least seem strange at first while others seem as though they serve no practical purpose. But, from what I have realized, most of these customs have a deep scientific basis. And, come to think of it, we would be amazed at the level of understanding of science shown by our ancestors while starting off these customs. But a disclaimer to this view is that not all customs are scientifically based. Lots of them are purely blind-faith and serve no practical purpose other than to further the cause of that particular religion.  Since, we're on the topic of Buddhism and more specifically chanting, lets take this as the first example. Ok, so what is chanting? It is repeated utterance of a particular word or phrase in a rythmic manner. Now appreciation of music or rythm is the job of the right hemisphere of the brain  (yeah, Abe, if you're reading this, you already know this!) . The left hemisphere controls the day to day binary activities. So, if you lead a hectic, stressful life, the left hemisphere of the brain is overworked. Now, chanting in a rythmic manner stimulates the right hemispere and there is a 'switch-over' from the  work-horse  left part to the  creative  right half of the brain. When this happens, it provides a stimulus for creative/positive thinking and causes a relaxing effect on our mind and body. With a lot of positive thinking and relaxed mind, karmic bliss is not a distant goal anymore. So there... I enlightened you people!! ... isn't that a noble thing?! ;-)  Ok, lets consider another example... Hindus usually observe a month of vegetarian diet during the month of  Shravana (this is according to the Hindu calendar) . Now, people who normally enjoy a hearty non-vegetarian meal, go without eating a morsel of meat or eggs or fish during this month. Fisherfolk do not even go fishing during this month. Now, why is that?! ...  Shravan (which is currently going on, by the way)  falls during the rainy season. During this period, the fish are supposed to reproduce. So, the wise old men of Hindu religion decided that they should let the fish mate and reproduce without disturbing the natural scheme of things. And so, Hindus are discouraged from eating fish during this month. A similar argument  (though not one relating to reproduction)  goes for other sources of meat. So, even those food products are not touched. Plus it also helps that many Hindu festivals also fall within thes one-month period  (and no non-veg during festivals!) . And therefore we have a period of one month when no non-vegetarian food is partaken in many Hindu homes.  Believe it or call it just a convenient explanation. This is what I believe... primarily because I refuse to follow by blind-faith. I allow myself to follow a custom only if I find that it has a logical explanation. So, there!  Anyways, this isn't a religious discourse. Far from it,  au contraire !! ;-)   Well, I'm not going to bore you further on this! ... And I'll blog about other stuff after some time... i.e. after I take a night's sleep!! ...  I need sleep!!!   bye for now... cheers!

       Virtual Reality  I got a lot of feedback for the statement I made in yesterday's blog, about my facial features resembling those of  Milind Soman . Now, I would like to clarify that those were not my views. Hell!... I feel I look like a complete dork. Looking like some successful model is miles away!! So, I guess that settles the matter...  wot say?!  ;-)  If you really want to know how I look like... well... then look at my stortrooper  *LOL* . And if even that does not satisfy your curiousity, then just click on the stortrooper. What you would see is the closest representation of  moi  that can be achieved without actually photographing me.  (or without a good artist painting my portrait!) . That is a virtual 3D model of me, which I created at  urlLink this  site. Cool, ain't it?! ;-)   Now... does virtual Sameer look even remotely similar to Milind Soman?... I say no!!  Apart from creating the virtual model, I got a lot of work done today here at the workplace. So, I'm quite glad with the way my day passed. After all, its not often that your programs compile at the first shot without any errors! :-)  I also got my team registered for  urlLink SuperSelector , the fantasy cricket competition run by ESPN-Star Sports. Its being revived after a gap of 4 months and with the ICC Champions Trophy just round the corner, it promises to be an exciting time with lots of cricket to watch on TV and lots of SuperSelector action on the Net. But, I guess without the presence of players like Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, the tournament would not be the same! Unless some miracle occurs and they sign the ICC contract, I can't see them playing in the tournament. But then, thats ok!  Among other things...  urlLink Sindhu  got a new layout and  urlLink Amrita  linked me at her site and I returned the favour in the same token. :-)  Lastly, my tooth is killing me... and I can't stand the pain! I guess I should visit the dentist soon. But the prospect of a drill entering my mouth isn't so enticing... in fact it is downright scary!! :-(  Well, anyways... thats all from me for the day!  cheers!

       Coincidences?  Two things that happened in the last week apart from the movie  Signs , got me thinking if indeed there is a greater force that guides our lives. This has got nothing to do with religion or God  (after all, according to me, God is nothing more than the manifestation of all the good qualities that we expect in a human being, plus a couple of miracles thrown in for good measure!) . I'm not an atheist nor am I a hardcore theist. Oh well... I digress!  So, both the things that happened to me last and that I'm referring to now, happened in BEST buses (for the uninitiated, BEST stands for Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport. The excellent public bus service run by BEST is one of the lifelines of Mumbai alongwith the local trains. I'm sure Mumbaiites would concur with the view that BEST is indeed the best!) . So, I was travelling home from office last Thursday and I took a different route home than usual. I was sitting in a window seat listening to my walkman, when from the corner of my eye I saw something flying towards me. Before I had anytime to react, a stone struck the gap between two windows  (right next to where I was sitting)  and the sound of the impact had my ears ringing. Some dirt/soil from the stone hit me on my face. I realized from the sound that it was a biggish stone and had it not been for that gap between the windows, I could have had my face split open!!  The other incident occurred the next day, i.e Friday. Situation was pretty similar to the earlier day's incident. I was sitting in a BEST bus  (this time I was taking my normal route home) , listening to my walkman... again in a window seat! Now, during the rainy season, the Mumbai roads are an unholy mess... riddled with more potholes than there are craters on the moon's entire surface. So, at a traffic signal, the bus eased to a halt. As it slowly came to a standstill, one of the rear tyres of the bus hit a pothole and the bus tilted slightly sideways and hit the broadside of a truck standing very close by. The tarpaulin covered metal frame of the truck hit the gap between the windows which were right next to me. Once again, I was saved by the slightest of margins... literally missed by a whisker.  Well, two incidents on two consecutive days that could have resulted in a badly bruised face... optimistically speaking! And to top it all, I went and saw  Signs , the next day i.e. Saturday. And Signs speaks about the very same thing... all that happens, has a meaning... you just have to see the signs and interprete them!   *LOL* ... this is not about religion or faith! Just a series of strange coincidences that occured to me last week. Nothing more to it! But... what do you people think?!   Anyways... today while I was having lunch, a colleague looked at me and remarked that I bear resemblance to  Milind Soman . I dunno whatever gave him the idea!!! ...  *LMAO*  ... as far as I can tell, I can see no similarity. But another colleague agreed with him and I didn't know whether they were serious or the joke was on me!  ha ha ha! ... But the strange thing is that the only other person who has ever said that my facial features are similar to Milind Soman's, is my mom. Now... I can't go upto any person and ask him if I remind him of  Milind Soman ...  *ROTFL* . I'm sure to be laughed at if I do that! ;-)  But on the other hand... if I keep a couple of days' stubble and flex my muscles a bit, then perhaps...  (there I go...!!! *LOL*)   Anyways, enuf said about me... actually more than enuf said about me!!  Ok... among other news... the Indian cricketers got an ally in the form of the South African cricket team. The South Africans too decided to refrain from signing the controversial ICC contract. The Indians had been isolated in their opposition to the ambush marketing clause in the contract and now that they've got support from SA., they might renew their protest. Good!! ... the greedy ICC needs to be taught a lesson.  Hey...  urlLink Amrita  is going places as far as her new domain is concerned. She set up a blog site on her domain, today... and it is a fantastic site. Great work, Amrita!! Keep it up!  So I come to the end of yet another day's blog! Hope I did not bore you too much!  cheers!

      Ahh!... the blog continues!! ;-)  So... where was I?! ... ummmm... ohh yes! ... I finished describing  Signs . Well, after Signs, we had a wonderful time at  Ovenfresh   (at Shivaji Park... which is just a hop-skip-and-jump away from Starcity, the place where we saw Signs) . We ordered pizza  (actually Radhika ordered the pizza) ) with all the possible vegetarian toppings, then we ordered a sizzler  (I think, Faiz ordered that)  and we really dug into some delicious, heavenly pastries at the end of it!! A wonderful repast!!  *LOL   Then while returning home, I went to this arts & handicrafts store near our house called  Nirmitee . They have this  Lord Ganesha  handicrafts mela going on  (which was inaugurated by Bejan Daruwala, the lovable Parsi bloke who writes weekly forecast column in the Sunday Times of India) . They had such amazing variety of artefacts on Lord Ganesha... tiny idols to huge ones, paintings, earthern  diyas , lanterns, stone carvings, crystal pieces, etc. I bought a small idol to place on top of my PC. It is small and really well carved and looks kinda cute!   Ok... so Saturday turned into Sunday without any further notable incident. Sunday was again, like usual, a relaxed day. I have a policy that since I have two days off in a week, I keep Sunday aside for total relaxation and so, I throw a tantrum if I am made to work on a Sunday. Saturday is okay... I allow myself to work a little on Saturday, but Sunday is a complete holiday.! :-)  There wasn't much that happened on Sunday. Michael Schumacher won... yet again! If this continues, then I don't think I'll stay an F1 fan for long!! Among other things, India and Germany clashed in a  Champion's Trophy  hockey match. Indians played well and kept up the pressure on the Germans right throughout the match, but a defensive mistake in the last few minutes saw India concede a penalty corner which the Germans converted and won the match 3-2. Tough luck for the Indians!  Ok... nothing much to report. But, I've been saving the best for the last!!! ...  urlLink Abe  sent me my first ever fansign!!! ... ain't that grand!!??  Well, here it is!!...       That was just too damn sweet of you, Abe!! :-)) Three cheers for you!!!   Well, I guess, thats it for now. Meet you all again tomorrow... same place... and possibly the same time!  *LOL*   cheers!

       Can you see the Signs?!  Its funny how I have all the time in the world on weekends but never quite manage to find some time to blog. I do download stuff, update my anti-virus   (this is important!! ... do you update your anti-virus definitions regularly? If not, please do!! ... you wouldn't want your PC to come down with a bug it caught while roaming around freely on the web, do you?!)  . I also chat with friends, but blogging is something I never quite get around to doing in weekends. I wonder why!!  Well then, I had a pretty good weekend. The  pooja  on account of Krishna Janmashtami on Friday went off very smoothly and I feasted on loads of sweets till I felt like an alligator after a hearty meal ... very sluggish!! ;-)  They were showing Aks on one channel and though I liked the beginning, it went on to become too gloomy and boring as the movie progressed past the halfway point. Good thing, I did not venture out to see it in a theatre when it was released a few months back.  Come Saturday, and the entire city wore a festive look with gangs of boisterous youths, called   Govinda  s, roamed the city streets looking for   dahi-handi  s to break. Well, for those who don't know what I'm talking about, here's a piece of mythology. Janmashtami is the birth anniversary  (according to the Hindu calendar)  of  Lord Krishna . And, Lord Krishna was one mischevious soul during his childhood. He used to gather his friends and sneak off to some house and steal curds/cream just for fun.  (well, its strange to see that the Gods themselves were expert thieves, but thats the way it is!) . Anyways, to discourage this theft, people used to hang their pots of curds and cream higher-up, near the ceiling. So, Krishna, the brat that he was, got his friends to form a human pyramid and used to climb on top of it and steal the cream. So, this traditional  theft  of curds/cream is played out every year after Janmashtami. People tie a pot of curd high up in the streets and this Govinda gangs emulate Lord Krishna by forming a human pyramid to reach the pot and claim the coveted booty of curds. Well, if you wanna see how it is like then... here it is...       Looks dangerous, doesn't it?! ... Well, it IS somewhat dangerous! But it doesn't deter these guys from doing it. It isn't a religious ritual. Nor, is it compulsory. But the sheer enthusiasm of the people participating in it, is something to be seen to be believed. Thousands of tourists can be seen on the Mumbai streets on this day with their handycams and SLRs, trying to snap up pictures of this unique performance.  Well, as it turned out, there was a Sale at  Shopper's Stop  and my sis couldn't resist it. So, I had to tag along and help her select her dresses. This time she wanted something formal for her job interviews  (you see, she's just become a Chartered Accountant and she's been getting some interview calls) . After spending a couple of hours shuttling between the four floors of Shopper's Stop, I managed to be free.  I was supposed to go to see  Signs  with my friends and with the traffic on the road due to the Govinda processions, I was afraid that I might not make it to the theatre in time. But, I did reach there well in time.. Faizan and Jayesh wre already there. Rochelle, Scubo and Radhika made a late appearance. Even then, we managed to miss the opening few seconds of the movie. Anushka and Mahua, members of  urlLink VIVA   (the all-girl band which was formed with the help of  urlLink Channel [V] )  were also there to watch the movie. Well, about the movie, I can say that it was good without being great. Mel Gibson is good, but Joaquim Phoenix is better and the kids, Rory and Abigail are even better. Though the plot is contrived and almost predictable  (heh heh!... I'm not going to give away the ending, for the benefit of those who haven't seen it!) , it does make you sit through the movie with a sense of expectation and foreboding. The best thing about it, though, is that it doens't rely on mayhem, special effects or green, gooey alien drool to create that feeling of danger. It plays on the human psychology and the basic human fear of the unknown. M. Night Shyamalan gets top marks, from my side, for handling a not-so-new subject with sensitivity and panache. Go see it if you haven't already!  I think... thats it for now... even though I have more to blog about, I'll stop this blog right here since it is becoming a huuuuuge blog. So, I'll back with the concluding part of this blog, later in the day! :-)  cheers!

       Of Ganpati-hopping and Paraskevidekatriaphobes  no time to blog today!!... have to go visit my relatives.  And tomorrow, I'll be going to Pune to spend the weekend there and see all the famous Ganpatis in Pune  (Pune is really famous for its Ganeshotsav celebrations) . So, in effect, I'll be  Ganpati-hopping , as  urlLink Amrita  puts it!  *LOL*   I'll be checking out the  Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati  and the  Kasba Peth Ganpati , both of which are very famous. I'll take a few snaps and get them scanned after I'm back to Mumbai  Ok, its Friday the 13th today and since I'm not a  friggatriskaidekaphobe , I'm not afraid of it!! In fact,  13  is my lucky number. Most of the good things that have happened to me, have happened either on the 13th or 26th.  heh heh!!   So, who among you all is a  friggatriskaidekaphobe ? ... or a  paraskevidekatriaphobe  for that matter?  *LOL*   Well then, good bye folks... have a fab weekend! ... au revoir!!   cheers!

       I'm a hazard to myself ...  and others too!!   Why do I feel as if I've lived this life before?! ... I keep on getting this strong sense of  dja vu  time and again. Its almost as if there's some glitch in the  Matrix !!  *LOL*   ... and this coffee that I'm having, sucks!! :-/  My mood during the day was really crappy. Well, not exactly foul... just crappy! I was chatting with Rochelle and she had to bear the full brunt of my mood!! ...  poor girl!!  I bored her to death with my pathetic attempts at humour.  Boy!!!  when I do that I really hit the rock bottom and start scratching to go even further below. I'm surprised that Rochelle didn't tear her hair out in frustration!!  *LMAO*   Actually, I was working on something here in the office and that something was working halfway. I mean, I couldn't say that it wasn't working at all, but at the same time, it did not run as per plan. I was certain that it was due to some very very minute bug in the code or some miniscule problem in the way I had configured the system. And it was driving me nuts... not being able to find the exact cause of the glitch!!.   Finally, in the evening, without warning, and after about sixty seven zillion attempts at configuring the system correctly... the damned thing started working. That too without a warning and when I was least expecting it. I was tempted to jump up and run around yelling  Eureka, Eureka!! . But then I realized that I was fully clothed and the prime requirement for shouting those words was that you have to be naked   la  Archimedes!! So, I just smiled and let out a sigh!! ;-)   To make the long story short... I'm in a better mood now than I was during the entire day. :-)  Anyways... tomorrow, I'm supposed to accompany my parents to my aunt's place. They don't get  Ganapati  at their home, but they do have  Gauri ... and we'll be going there for the  darshan . I'm not too excited at the idea of going, mainly because all my aunts will keep on fussing over me and pestering me with such silly questions as  "When are you planning to get married?" . Aaaaaahhhh!! ... I hate such questions!! ... Why don't they just let me be!!?  But on the brighter side, I get to meet my cousins... and thats the only redeeming aspect of tomorrow's visit! More importantly, I get to meet my niece who's just a year old. Well, she's damn cute!! ... and I feel happy when I can make her smile!!! :-)  Well ohh-kay! ... thats about it for now! ... I guess!  cheers!   P.S. :  (if ever there is such a thing as a Post Script to a blog!)  ... Ok ppl, please do not be miserly when commenting.

       A small big blog  I'm feeling unusually bored today and I cannot point a finger to the reason why I'[m feeling that way today. Well, actually, I've had a pretty good day so far. Most of the things I had planned on doing today at work have been completed successfully. But there is still a niggling sense of boredom at the back of my mind. (Nope! ... it doesn't have anything to do with today being 9/11) .  Darn!!  ... I hate this!!  I don't feel like blogging today... but I want to blog. Sounds crazy, doesn't it?!... It does... to me!!  So, I'm just gonna publish something I've written a long time back. Maybe you've already read it, because I did include link for it in the control panel, to the right.  You all will have to bear with me through this self-indulgent rant that follows. Ok, so here goes...    My Dieting Blues     "You won't be required to learn swimming now!" my sister opened a conversation one day with this cryptic remark. Cryptic because there was no mention of 'swimming' in the recent past as far as my recollection of the event goes.  I guess she must have seen the question mark on my face because she went on to explain, "You see, fat people are supposed to float naturally on water!" I was speechless for a few moments in which my mind reeled under this caustic barb.  'Fat' was certainly not how I liked to describe myself. 'Big-boned', 'healthy', etc. were the euphemistic terms that I reckoned fit me better. But then the damage was done. I couldn't get the word 'fat' out of my head from then on. At every possible opportunity I managed to sneak glances at myself in the mirror (trying to be as nonchalant as possible while doing so, because I certainly did not want to be branded as 'vain'). Slowly the realisation dawned (and not a moment too soon) that I had indeed put on some amount of weight that I could easily have done without.  So now what could be done? Yes, a diet would certainly fit the bill here, I thought. So that moment saw me vehemently promising to go on a diet aiming at a fitter and slimmer me. But then I knew nothing about going on a diet. Sure, I had heard a lot of things. But how in the name of God does one start off? Ignorance was certainly not bliss in this case. I started reading health magazines and websites by the dozen. I consulted family members, friends, their family members, their friends and so on and so forth till I met so many people that I felt I had proved the theory of 'six degrees of separation'. I got gorgeously different advice from each of them.  A category of people gave advice on food. One said, "Stop eating potatoes". Another said, "Stop eating rice". Still another quipped, "Stop eating anything for dinner". And another threw in "Stop eating.". Another group of people attacked my lifestyle. "Start exercising!", "Stop late nights", "Stop smoking" (I don't know why I was given this advice. I never smoke), "Stop drinking alcohol", "Change your job. Try a field job", "Shift out of the city to a village". An elderly gentleman even asked me to go find inner peace by throwing myself at the feet of God (I wonder how that helps!).  My mind was a vortex of ideas and suggestions, all spinning around rapidly and causing even more confusion than I had started out with. Finally I decided to start the actual diet with a plan of my own. The first thing I did, was to get myself weighed on a weighing scale at a railway station. I stood on the scale, inserted a coin in the slot and waited as the machinery inside the colourful scale began whirring. Before long, a card, much like a railway ticket, popped out which in turn had me eyes popping out reading the registered weight. I definitely needed to diet.And diet hard!   So I did just that!Or at least I started!!... The chocolates stopped. So did the sweets. I rationed the amount of tea/coffee that I consumed during the day. I started eating lesser amount of virtually everything I ate. Someone told me to have lots of water during the day. I complied and it helped too. I burnt a fair amount of calories just making the frequent (and urgent!) trips to the loo!   My mom suggested that I have lemon juice mixed with honey in lukewarm water in the mornings on an empty stomach. Who can refuse a mom? So I did that too. Other than starting the day with the sour taste of lemons in my mouth it did nothing for my weight. On the contrary I started having something sweet just to remove that confounded taste from my mouth.  By the start of the second week, I could make out no difference in my figure as I gazed at myself in the mirror looking for signs of success. Disappointed but not disheartened, I vowed to continue the diet. But it was difficult. Returning home from the office, everyday I could smell the wonderful aroma of food being cooked. This used to send the crows in my tummy into frenzy, caw-cawing raucously. But then the word 'Fat' used to dance in front of my mind's eyes, and I could do nothing other than let the crows shout till they dropped dead inside my stomach. I would then proceed to bury them under salads of various kinds.  It was worse when I saw my friends eating ice creams and sweets. I barely managed to stop myself from drooling in public. At the end of the second week I decided to stop this madness from driving me round the bend. This was it, I decided. I have to check up on my progress and decide the further course of action. The weighing scale at the railway station beckoned again. And I went to it. As I climbed on to it, I could hear my heart beating out aloud. Then I inserted a coin in the slot and waited. The machinery inside the scale once again started its cheerful dance. As the disc rotated around in circles, I found myself praying to god. There was a clicking sound and the disc stopped. Another set of clicks and a card popped its head out of a slot. I removed the card with my eyes closed and held it in front of my face. And slowly opened my eyes.   This time thankfully, the eyes did not pop out of the sockets. How could they?!  It was the same figure that had filled my consciousness for the past two weeks. I was accustomed to it.  My eyes didn't pop out .  Among other things... I had been to my uncle's place in New Bombay, yesterday. They have Ganapati at their house and so I'd gone there with my mom, dad and sis. The drive going there was pretty smooth. But, the drive back was a headache since there was some checking going on at Sion where the police had set up a  naka-bandi . This had resulted in a bumper-to-bumper traffic right from Sion upto Chembur. And the cars moved only inches at a time. By the time we reached home, I had a headache measuring 8.7 on the Richter scale!!  *LOL*   That's all folks!  (tell me... who has made this line famous... I mean, "That's all folks!" ? ... This is your homework for the day! *LOL*)   cheers!

       A totally  filmi  blog  I did all that I had said I would do during the weekend... put my feet up and relaxed... grew a stubble... looked like a bum. So, should I classify this weekend as a success because I did everything I thought I would do. Or do I consider it as a failure since I did nothing productive and wasted two days ... i.e. 48 hours  of my life?!  *LOL*   Friday evening, I saw  Chocolat , the delightful movie about a little French town that is transformed when a woman and her daughter set up a chocolate shop there and promise to ignite the passions of the townspeople with their sinfully delicious chocolate concoctions. It is a simple movie with a heart-warming storyline... which was why I liked it. Hollywood should produce more movies like this rather than the trash it serves out under the guise of entertainment.  While on the subject of movies, I don't think it is possible, these last few days, to have been in India and not to have heard about the controversy that erupted over   Ek Chotisi Love Story  . First and foremost, the movie itself isn't an original piece of work. It is a verbatim copy from a Polish art film   A Short Story About Love  . Apart from the storyline that has been copied, even individual scenes have been plagiarized frame-to-frame  (even the love-making scenes, right down to the positions that the lovers use while making love, are same!) . To top this, the director, Shashilal Nair proudly claims that he thought that the Polish film was so perfectly picturized that he did not feel the need to tamper with the scenes...  yeah, right!!  :-|  Secondly, Manisha Koirala, the lead actress in the film, claims that her modesty was outraged because the director exposed more of her skin than was agreed upon. Fair enough complaint to make! ... But the basic flaw in this argument is that it is Manisha who has exposed herself on-screen. It was her body double, Jessica Choksi, a struggling model, who did the semi-nude scenes!! So... Manisha, why all the noise?!  A few days back I read an article in a newspaper which stated that, Manisha Koirala, the grand-daughter of a former prime minister of Nepal, has political ambitions and would like to enter politics in her home country of Nepal. If this indeed is true then, I guess, it explains why she is so hung up over the exposure that she hasn't actually done.  *LOL* . So, what does she do next?... She goes to Bal Thackeray and asks him to ensure that the film is not screened. Thackeray and his Shiv Sena are only too eager to help Miss Koirala in her venture. They are experts at disrupting screenings of films or plays. And, I guess  urlLink Amrita  was witness to such a disruption. Must've been plenty exciting!! ;-)  Now, snce the screening of the movie was stopped, Shashilal Nair started shouting himself hoarse claiming that this was an attack on democracy and an attempt to stifle his creativity. PLEASE!!! ... where in this whole episode, does creativity figure, Mr. Nair?!... oh well!! ... thieves usually consider their handiwork as a work of art... maybe thats where the creativity comes in!!  *LOL* ... And the height of all things absurd was reached when Shashilal Nair announced that he would go on a hunger strike until his film was screened!!  Basically, the film itself is based on an infatuation that a 15 year old boy develops for a 26 year old lady who stays in a nearby appartment. The boy fantasizes about having a relationship with the female, voyeuristically spies on his object of infatuation through a pair of binocs and slashes his wrists to show his undying love for her. Pretty controversial theme as far as Indian movies are concerned. But then, since I haven't seen the movie  (and I don't intend to!) , I would not know how well or how badly the subject has been handled.  Well... well... while the main act was being played out in the press between Manisha and Nair, an interesting sidelight was added to the whole episode when, Manisha's double in the movie, Jessica, announced that Nair had extracted more exposure from her than was initially agreed upon  (a fact that I am sure would have never seen the light of the day had this controversy about the film not erupted so publicly) . And Jessica went on to say that she did the semi-nude scenes in the movie because she wanted money to support her ailing mother. As far as I am concerned, this was a classic  filmi  excuse for showing skin on-screen... nothing more... nothing less!  Whew!! ... such a complicated muddle!... I never read film magazines and I hate film gossip. But this entire drama has been played out on the first page of all the national dailies  (and on headlines of all news channels)  over the past few days and it was not possible to ignore it. Anyways, it has managed to make a mediocre film into a major attraction for the masses. And I believe, Shashilal Nair will go laffing all the way to the bank in the end...  pathetic... really pathetic!!   Sheeesh! ... I don't believe I wrote so much about this foolish thing!!  Anyways, the final cricket Test between India and England provided some good entertainment over the weekend. The Indian team,  (like they've done on numerous occaisons through this summer)  confounded expectations and played extremely well to match England's 515 with 508. Rahul Dravid  a.k.a Jammy , played a fantastic inning of 217 and helped India out of trouble. It was Dravid's third century in a row on the tour!! ... Well done Jammy!!  Hey... Abe's got a fantastic new layout. Go, check it our at  urlLink Tristorm.org ! ... I just love the classy graphic she has done at the top of her blog page. Keep it up Abe... may you continue doing great layouts!!   urlLink Nirav  blogged about hs magic/tragic moments from Indian cricket. I loved that idea. Maybe I'll do that some time in my blogs. :-)  One of AMrita's friends, it seems, lost her cell phone recently, when it was stolen from her purse. Now, it seems such incidents are on the rise in Mumbai. And it also looks as though the mobile phone operators put up their hands when such a case is brought to their notice. I dug up in my inbox and found an old mail that was related to this topic. I dunno how authentic it is... but you might as well give it a try.  (and don't blame me if it doesn't help!!)  :-) ... Read the following instructions...   To check your Mobile phone's serial number, key in the following digits on your phone: * # 0 6 #  A 15 digit code will appear on the screen. This number is unique to your handset.(not related to your service provider). Write it down and keep it somewhere safe.  Should your phone get stolen, you can phone your service provider and give them this code. They will then be able to block your handset so even if the thief changes the Sim card your phone will be totally useless to the thief  You probably won't get your phone back, but at least you know that whoever stole it can't use/sell it other. If everybody did this, there would be no point in stealing mobile phones.   As I said... I dunno how authentic this is!!  Yeaaahhh!!! ... tomorrow's a holidayyyyy!!! ... Its   Ganesh Chaturth i  tomorrow and all of India  (especially Mumbai and Pune)  will welcome its darling deity,  Ganapati  into their homes tomorrow. But more about Ganesh festival will follow in the blogs this week. So, thats it for now... I'll leave you all with the punch-line from  AMUL 's latest ad. The ad refers to  Ek Chotisi Love Story  and has a cartoon showing Manisha, Nair and a movie projector... and calls for the film to be named  Ek Motisi Love Story !!...  ... and those who've seen Manisha lately will immediately agree with this assessment!!  *ROTFL*   cheers!

       A Local encounter  If I was busy yesterday, I've been busier today!... busy with a capital  B !!! ... and that too, busy doing a really boring and pointless thing  (remember the "unmentionable" thing I blogged about yesterday!)  *LOL*  Right now, I'm bleary eyed, cotton-mouthed and can feel the onset of acidity growing from the base of my stomach and rising up to my chest like a poisonous mist...  *LMAO* ... gosh! I'm so melodramatic and full of shit!! . But all this is courtesy of the freaking  unmentionable  thing.  *grrrrr*    *LOL* ... anyways, since I don't have much time to do any serious blogging... I'll do what I normally do! ... Put up some piece of scribbling that barely passes the muster!  Actually I wasn't going to do even that much today, but I read  urlLink Suku 's blog today morning. It was about this nice little incident that took place while she was travelling in a local train. It reminded me of one of my own encounters while commuting by a Mumbai Local. I had written about it and it got published in our office's online mag. So, I thought... why not put up this articlethat I had once written, instead of posting nothing! ;-) ... (you would say,... "what a shameless way to advertise his own sad stuff!!"... *LOL*)   Well, the shameless brute that I am... I would anyway publish my article... so here goes! ;-)   some of the expressions used in this piece are in Hindi... so if you don't understand that... please feel free to contact me!    A short journey in a Mumbai Local  The train stands still, ready to ferry tired souls to their cubbyholes in the suburbs. I strain my eyes to read the tiny illuminated letters on the indicator suspended high up in the soaring roof of "the station formerly known as VT". I manage to decipher the word 'Dadar' on it. My mind accustomed to seeing "will not halt at" list of stations on the indicator, registers a silent surprise. But the surprise lasts only as long as it takes my eyes to travel to the top of the display, which rebelliously proclaims "will halt at". They say the Indian Railways are undergoing a change. I certainly didn't expect it to be a change of wording on the indicators. Long live India! I climb into a second class compartment.  I am suddenly engulfed by a monotonic murmur only interrupted by a loud guffaw or two from a Gujarati stockbroker for whom this is probably the only time in the day to relax and unwind. My watch shows 8:40 PM. Two minutes past the scheduled departure time. The train is still standing, taking in many more tired souls. At 8:44 PM there's a tooting of the horn and with a sudden lurch the local begins its journey.  A motley bunch of people unleashes a loud religious shout and with a tinkle of tiny cymbals, starts singing an obscure bhajan with gusto. This is the famous 'bhanjan mandli' of the Mumbai Local scene. The train has gathered a fair speed now and the rhythmic beat of the wheels on the uneven rail sleepers is imparting a certain 'avant garde' feel to the bhajan tragicomically reducing it from the sublime to the ridiculous. So much for God.   "Dadar kahan aayega?"  I ask a pair of 'seasoned' travellers standing beside me.   "Yeh side mein" , comes the reply from the older of the two.  Heeding the advice I gravitate towards the door on the indicated side. There is a moment of silence followed by an excited titter behind me. The younger of the two 'seasoned' travellers calls out to me and informs me that his older friend was wrong and in fact Dadar will come on the other side. I make a show of thanking him for the help and change ends.  I stand uncomfortably, shifting weight from one leg to the other carrying the bag containing books, which now feels heavier than it actually is!   "Yeh boot kaunsa hai?"  a short man standing next to me asks innocently.    "Adidas" , I reply mentally smiling at a groaner (about Adidas) which springs to mind.   "Bahut achcha hain. Mehenga rahega na?"  innocently once more!   "Woh to hain!. Lekin achcha chalega."  I defend my choice of  expensive  footwear.   "Main bhi aisa joota pehenta tha."  he responds almost in an admission of guilt,  "Lekin ab shirt pant ke saath sports shoes achcha nahi dikhta office mein" . I just nod.  Silence. And then some more silence! I think I have discouraged the man.   "Niche ka dikhayenge, please?"  I shrink back at this scandalous sounding request, till a clarification comes as an afterthought,  "Sole!"   I transfer the bag into my right hand, catch the overhead handle with the left and bring my upturned foot up for closer inspection by the short guy. I cannot help but chuckle inwardly about my pose  standing one legged in a train crammed with people, showing off the sole of my shoe to a complete stranger.  Thankfully, the train slows down enough for me to realize that Dadar has arrived. As the local chugs to a halt I jump off the footboard and onto the platform before hordes of 'tired souls' rush into the compartment already packed to much more than its capacity. I pause for a moment on the platform to see people transform briefly into angry cats, snarling to get a foothold on the train.  The local lurches once again and resumes its journey. I wait till the train leaves the station. Then I start climbing the steps of the footbridge, pitying the next man who would start a conversation with the short guy on the train!   Ok ppl... I promise to come back tomorrow with a genuine blog! :-)  cheers!

       Busy  I'm currently busy in an unmentionable activity!! Wayyy too busy!! ... Don't you worry people! ... this particular activity is decent enough to be mentioned in print  (or on national television!) , but I'll not mention it just yet... maybe later! ;-)  Really... no time to blog! ... So. I'll resort to the tactics they use on TV ...  re-runs !!!  I had written the following piece for our office's online magazine. And I guess, most of you must have already read about it... given the fact that a link is ever present on this page! ... Anyways, if you haven't already read it... please do! ...  *LOL*    How I survived a writer's block and lived to tell about it    The other day, I got myself a cup of steaming coffee and turning on my PC, sat down in front of it, intending to do some writing (uh huh! 'Typing' would be more appropriate). As the ubiquitous MS-Word splash-screen flashed on the monitor followed by the cursor blinking on a blank document, I started trying to think of a topic to pen my thoughts on. And suddenly my mind seemed completely blank. It was a weird feeling - nothing seemed to pop up in my mind.  I sat there facing the screen, rooted to the chair, as if struck by some immobility charm. The cursor blinked on impatiently, waiting for me to make the first move. And somehow, I did not know what I was supposed to do in order to get my 'creative' juices flowing.  I then tried to force my mind into getting started. My fingers, hesitantly typed cliched lines like, "It was a dark and stormy night." just to jumpstart the creative thinking that my mind suddenly seemed to have forgotten about. But, my mind, like an old jalopy, stubbornly refused to rev up and start.   When you are trying to type something on a word-processor or a PC, you miss out on the experience of tearing the paper off the stationery pad or the typewriter, crumpling it into a ball and tossing it into the waste-paper basket with the finesse of a NBA star player. In the pre-PC days, the waste-paper basket used to bear testimony to the frustrations of a writer. Often, depending on the writer's level of frustration, there used to be more crumpled paper balls in the basket than there are golf balls at the bottom of a water hazard on a golf course. But, you can only delete the characters off the monitor in case of a PC to leave the slate clean and with no marks of the failed attempts at writing.  I got up from the chair and downed the remaining coffee in a gulp and splashed my face with some ice-cold water in an attempt to jerk my mind out of its stupor. Then I did a bit of spot jogging and a few push-ups. This, I had once seen in an English movie. It however had not helped the writer in the movie and since, they say, life imitates art (or is it the other way round. I can never tell), it did not help me either. If anything, I was out of breath at the end of it.  Then, I opened the window, looked up at the starlit sky, took a few deep breaths of the cool night air, rolled up my sleeves and once again sat down in front of the monitor. The cursor was by now, I am sure, mocking at me. With renewed gusto, I attacked the keyboard once more. After 15 minutes of furious activity that involved, typing, deleting, banging my fist on the desk and cursing under the breath, I stopped to see my handiwork on the screen. "It was dark and stormy night and the dogs were howling in the distance." was all that could be seen on the screen. My mind, stubborn than the proverbial mule, was refusing to budge!   The next few minutes were spent clutching my head in my hands while my elbows rested on the desk. What would it take for me to be able to conjure up some topic and write again!! I could think of no answer to even this question. Then it suddenly struck me. I was suffering from a case of 'writer's block'!   This was the first time that I had contracted this affliction. It was supposed to be a prerogative of real writers and authors. And here I was, the amateur scribbler that I am, being tormented by the writer's block. A hint of a smile touched the corners of my mouth and spread across till I was grinning from ear to ear. My very own writer's Block!! Wow! I must be a real writer, I thought! This called for a celebration and so, I opened the drawer of the desk and treated myself to a candy bar.   The next couple of days I could not help but brag about my writer's block to my friends and to almost everybody that I had a chance to talk to. I made it out to be a big deal and felt good about it. It must have shown on my face, though. Because, someone whom I had not told about it looked at me and asked in hushed tones, "Is it love?"   Then, I felt as though I had to document this piece of personal history. And since I am not affluent enough to afford golden letters to write about it, I had to make do with the same old MS-Word. So, I sat down to write about the 'writer's block', and immediately rattled off a few paragraphs describing my condition and how I came to realize that it was indeed a 'writer's block'. As, the thoughts were flowing from my mind to the keyboard and then onto the screen, I suddenly stopped typing.   It was gone! The 'writer's block' was gone! I could feel it. It was as if my mind was bursting with ideas and my hands were not fast enough to keep pace with them. I cursed my luck for providing me with such a short-lived writer's block. Then, I continued typing, and result of that effort is something that you've just finished reading!    Oh well... the unmentionable task beckons again!! ... take care, folks!  cheers!

       Reporter Sam  I thought I'll just do a round up of some current news and some interesting news stories that I've come across in the last couple of days.  First of all, the big news as far as India is concerned... 23 constituencies of the state of Jammu and Kashmir went to polls yesterday, i.e. 16th of September 2002, in what was the first round of elections in the state troubled by terrorism. The overall average voter turnout was a modest 44 percent, but that should be put into perspective while passing judgement. The votes were cast under the shadow of guns as the terrorists desperately tried to stall the progress of the polls. As a result, 44 percent assumes bigger significance when one also considers that sometimes lower voter turnout than 44% is recorded in some elections in other peaceful parts of the country. So, hats off to the spirit of the Kashmiri people! Well done!! A more complete coverage of the J&K polls is available  urlLink here .  On to sports now... The ICC Champions Trophy got underway in Sri Lanka last week and matches are being played almost everyday. Yesterday, the hosts Sri Lanka played Holland  (an absolute novice side as far as cricket is concerned) . The result was a foregone conclusion... Sri Lanka, playing in their usual blue outfits, walloped the Dutch, playing in almost obscenely bright orange clothes, by a huuuuuge margin. It was a mismatch really... which leads me to wonder why did they invite Holland to play in a tournament that is termed as the  Champions  Trophy?!! Anyways, today, West Indies took on Kenya and hoped to avoid the repeat of their shock defeat, years ago in Pune. Brian Lara scored 111 runs helping West Indies to reach a total of 261. Kenya could not quite match up to the task of overhauling the target and fell short by some 29 runs. But the news of the day was that Brian Lara was rushed to the hospital after his batting since he was feeling fatigued and uneasy. The preliminary reports indicated that Lara might be suffering from  Hepatitis . Thats a bad news! hope he recovers soon!!! Read about this story  urlLink here .   Shekhar Kapur , India's most prominent star on the firmament of world cinema, is ready with his next film. The film, titled,  urlLink The Four Feathers , based on AE W Mason's novel is supposed to be a a lavish mounted gripping tale of a young English soldier who quits the army on the eve of a crucial war and is branded a coward by his friends and fiance. The soldier, played by Heath Ledger, returns to the battlefield few months later to save the lives of the very same friends who had denounced him not too long ago. Many critics and reviewers have already predicted that this might be a strong Oscar contender. Well, I hope Shekhar Kapur does manage to win Oscars this time around. Anyways consider for a moment, the list of hits that this talented director has produced over the years...  Masoom ,  Mr. India ,  The Bandit Queen  and  Elizabeth . What a list to adorn his CV!!  Now, just a set of links to some interesting news...  They had a little time after picking peaches and before swimming, so Marie and Tom Burrows decided to take their grandson Zack to America's newest tourist attraction: an enormous pile of radioactive waste. Confused?!! ... read about  urlLink the nuclear dump for the whole family .  What happens when national television reports, on prime time, an incident that never took place?! ... Embarassment... feet in the mouth... and red faces. All this must have happened when Pakistan Television (PTV) announced the rigging of polls in one of the constituencies in the J&K elections. Investigative reporting at its best you would say... fair enough! But what if election never took place there at all! Read about this terrible faux pas  urlLink here .   Skippy  goes clubbing in Milan. Anybody would! ... in this trendy and  chic  Italian city. But Skippy is five-and-a-half feet tall kangaroo!! Read about  urlLink Skippy, the pub-hopping kangaroo .  *LOL* ... I think I bored you enough with news. But before I take your leave, here's a last bit of tidbit...   This one is from the irrepressible Navjyot Singh Sidhu... In the last test match between India and England recently, there was an incident when a streaker ran across the ground in his birthday suit. Speaking about the incident during the luncheon break, Sidhu exclaimed that   "Streakers are the people who want to show they're nuts!"  ... *LMAO*... Go figure!  cheers!

       Weekend treats  I'm getting really sick of saying every Monday that I've had a good weekend. This has become more of a  given  statement than a variable one. It prompts me to consider re-evaluating the parameters on which I base my assessment of the quality of the weekend that I've just spent. Maybe I'm setting my sights too low... maybe I'm satisfied  (or even overjoyed!)  over little pleasures... maybe I don't do much on weekends which really precludes the qualitative assessment of things I did during the weekend!  I strongly suspect that the last line of reasoning holds good in my case!  But the bottomline is that I really did have a great weekend!  (that turns the previous few lines into nothing more than a meaningless rant!)   Early morning drive to Pune on Saturday was, as usual, wonderful. The only thing that interrupted the incessant music and chatter on the FM radio on the car stereo, was my mother's occasional shriek when I did some high speed cornering in the  ghat  section of the expressway. Honestly, I took some of the curves on the road at some pretty hellish speeds!!  *LOL*   This time, however, on reaching Pune, we did not have to relive the excitement of discovering a robbed apartment.  How boring!!  In fact, we found that the builder had, very politely, bought for us, the items that we had lost to the burglars last time around. He said that it was his duty  (sic!)  to compensate us for our loss! My mother was having none of it as she refused to touch those items and had them sent back to the builder's office, immediately!  After a lunch that consisted of  mutter paneer  (that I helped my mom prepare!), I dozed off... grateful to catch up on the sleep that I had lost when I had to wake up early in the morning to leave for Pune. Later, we left the house to go do some serious  Ganpati hopping  throughout the city. It was as if the entire Pune had taken to the streets to get the  darshan  of their favourite elephant-headed deity. All the roads were packed with throngs of people, out with their families and friends literally Ganpati-hopping all over the city. The streets and the narrow by-lanes of Pune wore a festive look... a welcome change from the dark, medieval look that descends on the city streets once it is past 8:00 PM  (well, I'm speaking about Pune in general... the hip, up-market areas of Pune party late into the night, nowadays... much like Mumbai does!) .  Well, anyways, we saw lots many Ganpatis, including the famed  Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati . But it was too crowded to even walk, let alone drive... so we had to forego visiting some  Ganesh mandals . But some others that we saw were simply amazing. At one place, they had put up a dancing fountain. The colourfully lit water fountain danced to the beats of a man playing live music on a tabla. It was wonderfully creative!!  After dinner, I took everybody to  Portico  to have ice-cream  (they have some wonderful flavours there! . There was also an ulterior motive in taking everybody to Portico. They have a TV in the parlour, on which I wanted to see the final overs of the match between India and Zimbabwe. The ice-cream that we ate  (I had double scoop of Mocha Almond)  tasted doubly sweet because we had it while seeing India defeat Zimbabwe in a cliff-hanger of a match. Mohammad Kaif played wonderfully well  (yet again!)  and scored his first one-day century. Here's a bit of interesting coincidence... The last time we were in Pune on a Saturday, Indians played England in the Headingley Test Match. India won that Test Match with a historic margin of an innings and some runs. The time before that we were Pune on a Saturday, India played England in the NatWest Trophy one-day final, in which India scored another historic win by chasing 329 runs. Kaif had played the innings of his life with 87 not out. Kaif again played a fantastic innings of 111 not out this time on Saturday when we were in Pune! There's something about my being in Pune on a Saturday that inspires the Indian cricket team  (and especially, Kaif) !! ;-)  Well then, Sunday passed pretty well and I could be found sitting stretched out in the balcony of our 6th floor apartment in Pune, either looking at the vehicles speeding on the distant highway, or seeing the sunlight shimmering on the placid waters of Pashan lake, or watching the shepherd herd his flock of sheep across the undulating patch of grassy land that lay just across the street from where I stay. All the while, the stiff breeze blowing over the gently rolling hills beyond the highway played havoc with my unruly hair!  In short... I spent the Sunday in a wonderfully laid-back manner, recharging my batteries for the gruelling monotony  (oxymoron?!!)  of the weeks that lay ahead!  In the evening on Sunday, we drove back to Mumbai... again, driving at a pace that had my mom giving me a piece of her mind. I really should take it easy!! But I find the drive back to Mumbai more exciting that the one to Pune... even though the route is the same! I guess its because usually while returning to Mumbai, its evening and the sun is about to set. So, I feel like driving into the sun on a looong stretch of road... like those classic Hollywood movies!  *LOL*   All in all, a weekend well spent!  That's all for now, see you all again tomorrow... Take care!  cheers!

       ... but the castle's crumbled!!  Why does it happen sometimes, that we read signs and signals from certain situations and build up expectations and hopes. Every little thing then adds a bit to that mound of hope and this continues till the mound grows to form a hillock... then a hill and finally a mountain. All this while you are wallowing indulgently in a make-believe world.  And then... suddenly without any warning... something happens that blasts this mountain, that you've created, to smithereens!!  Jerked out of the dream that you've come to think of as reality, you grope around trying to find familiar people and objects, that never were! Thats when you realize the futility of it all!  Why does everything have to end so badly? ... you wonder!! But there are no answers... only questions!!   Then it all crashes down And you break your crown And you point your finger, but there's no one around Just want one thing Just to play the King But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name Where's your crown, King Nothing?   'nuf said!  have a nice weekend, folks!  cheers!  P.S. : with many thanx to Hetfield, Ulrich & co.! :-)

       I have gone crazy!  I've been having a nightmarish experience trying to write this blog. I've started this blog at least four times in the past one hour and four times it has run out of gas like a deflated balloon, after just about 4-5 lines into the venture. Am I hitting one of those road-blocks conveniently called  writers' blocks ? ... I hope not!! ... I've had enough troubles with them in the past and I would not like to repeat the history...  (Actually, History never repeats itself, as is erroneously believed... only Historians repeat themselves!) .   Uh-oh... now I've started to rant and rave about some incomprehensible inanities. I guess I'm just trying to thrash my way out of the hole that I've stumbled into. Speaking of holes, do you know that  Black Holes  are the most dense objects in the universe... so dense that even light that mistakenly stumbles into them, cannot escape out.  Shit!!  ...  STOP IT SAMEER!!!   Ok... peace! ... *shows a peace sign with the index and the middle fingers raised*  ... or is it just with the middle finger?? ... I forget!!  Well, did you all think, I was on the verge of becoming a nutcase!?? ... Well, you were wrong! ... 'coz I already am a screwball!! I have lost a screw or two from my head. So, if you come across me somewhere wandering and raving about  wanting a screw ... please don't mis-understand   this   screw for   that   screw!! ;-)  You know... these last few days have made it difficult for me to keep my sanity. The events have just been so... ummm... tumultuous!! No, I'm not talking about my personal life... I would be grateful to God if he can make my grant me a life less ordinary, for a few days  (the tedium of my life, both social as well as anti-social, has driven me past the outer extremes of boredom!) . I'm talking here about the events that have been taking place in India...  The storming of the temple and the despicable massacre of the devotees inside the temple premises is reason enough to make one lose one's sanity. It simply doesn't make sense!! ... they were just trying to pray!! What followed the event was a greater tragedy!! ... Media teams rushed in to capture the grim face of death, destruction and mayhem, to flash it across the screens of millions of viewers who were forced to digest scenes made up of mutilated bodies and blood soaked clothes, alongwith their dinner. The statutory warning,  some of the following scenes could be disturbing , doesn't atone the sin of making a circus out of a tragedy! Added to this was the over-enthusiasm of the on-site correspondents who thrust microphones and cameras into the faces of the relatives of those killed, just so that they could be the first ones to show to the world the grief that follows the death of a family member. Prime-time  reality  TV at its worst!!  Responsible Journalism ... is it too much to hope for... from our mediapersons?!... I guess so! :-(  Anyways... sorry for getting a bit carried away!! ... and  urlLink Suku , you are completely and absolutely excluded from the above diatribe against the journos!! :-)  Ummm... what else??!! ... yeah! ... yesterday was a holiday!! Indian people expressed their silent outrage at the temple massacre, by observing a  spontaneous bandh  yesterday. In some places, the spontaniety was even arranged to be captured on camera by the various journalists who roamed the empty streets and railway tracks looking for opportunities to snap up pictures of politicians, falling over themselves to stop buses and trains from plying, wearing their most  chic  khaadi outfits...  such patriotism!!   However, the event that almost made me insane with joy was the fantastic Indian victory over the perennial  chokers  of world cricket, South Africa! I returned home from office to find that the South Africans were cruising along with just one wicket down and just about 70 runs to get with about 13 overs to go. Any sane person would back South Africa from there. Any sane  cricket-crazy Indian  person would however hope against hope for an Indian victory. Well, I was one of these sane(??) cricket-crazy Indian persons!! My sister thought I was daft when I bravely predicted that India would romp home. And thats just when Yuvraj Singh lept to his right and plucked the ball out of the air just inches above the ground to send Jonty Rhodes back to the pavilion. From that moment on, the Indians never looked back and completed what can only be termed as one of the greatest comebacks by any team in the history of One-Day cricket. It was wonderful!! ... People went crazy in the stands... people went crazy in the streets of India... crackers burst and lit up the night sky... Ganguly walked back to the pavilion with the most surprised expression you will ever see on a cricketer's face.... and Sehwag spoke in his halting English while accepting the Man-of-the-Match award for the second time in succession. A wonderful day for Indian cricket!!  Well... thats about all that I can blog at this moment!... see you all later with more stuff!... take care!  cheers!   P.S.  : Suku... I just read your latest  urlLink article  on  urlLink Rediff . Liked it very much!...  Road  is probably the only Hindi movie among all the new films in the last few months that I wanna watch. Hope its nice!! :-)

       Boread and nothing to blog about!!  Just a few funny verses that I came across in recent times...    Little Miss Tuffet   Little Miss Muffet sat on her gluteal region, Eating components of soured milk. On at least one occasion, along came an arachnid and sat down beside her, Or at least in her vicinity, And caused her to feel an overwhelming, but not paralyzing, fear, Which motivated the patient to leave the area rather quickly.     Reflections on Ice-Breaking   Candy Is dandy But liquor Is quicker. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp-- Ogden Nash     Woe-song of a born geek   Here I sit, broken-hearted, All logged in, but work unstarted. First net.this and net.that, And a hot buttered bun for net.fat.  The boss comes by, and I play the game, Then I turn back to net.flame. Is there a cure (I need your views), For someone trapped in net.news?  I need your help, I say 'tween sobs, 'Cause I'll soon be listed in net.jobs.     Hmmm...   My darling wife was always glum. I drowned her in a cask of rum, And so made sure that she would stay In better spirits night and day.   Well, ok people... I didn't have anything to blog about today, which is why I posted these verses. So, till next time...  cheers!

       What will your message be?  What would you give to get a chance to communicate with your descendents. A chance akin to walking into the future and having a talk with the children of your children of your children of your children  ...  of your children!!  Do I sound like a crazy scientist who has just invented a Time Machine?? ...  Well, I hope not! ... because if all goes well, this seemingly outlandish idea is going to transform into a reality!!  ...(and I'm not talking about some Sci-Fi movie thats gonna be released soon!)     urlLink Project Keo   is going to turn the impossible into possible.  Keo  involves a space shuttle that is supposed to be launched from earth in late 2003. It would go deep into space and stay there for 50,000 years  (yup!! you heard me right!! ... fifty thousand years!)  and then return to the earth... intact! Sounds like an exciting adventure! ... But what purpose will a space shuttle from the past prove to our descendents? Well... before its launch, the space shuttle, Keo, will be loaded with our messages... our messages that we write today. It is this precious cargo that will come back to our descendents 50,000 years later, giving them a glimpse of their ancestors... a glimpse that, I'm sure, they'll be grateful for!  According to the project team of Keo, the purpose of this mission is,   To tell the people of tomorrow, more about the people of today And to reinvent our present world by sharing each other's dreams, aspirations, personal hopes so that we can address all of this to our faraway descendants .  Noble hopes indeed!  If you want to write your own message, you can go to  urlLink www.keo.org  and you'll find links to help you do that. By the way,  Project Keo  has been elected as the  Project of the 21st Century  by  UNESCO .    urlLink       Enuf said about Keo! ... lets get on to more worldly matters! ;-)  Couple of times last week, I referred to something  unmentionable  in my blogs and did not care to elaborate what that  unmentionable  thing was all about. Well, you see... it was just poor me filling up my yearly performance appraisal form! And it was such a boring and painful task that it took me two days of mind-numbing efforts trying to figure out things that I had done during the past year! Added to it was the fact that some fool in the HR department had bungled up and had missed out some important information that needed to go on my appraisal form. And it took something like  quintillion  phone calls and a  zillion  emails to my appraisal data updated with the required information, at the end of which I was pooped out! Why so much effort for an appraisal?! ...  Kya karen! ... Is paapi pet ke liye karna padta hai!!  *LMAO*  ;-)  Among other things... life has been going on pretty ok. I'm looking forward to the semi-final match tomorrow, between India and South Africa. I hope India can recreate even half the magic they displayed while batting against England on Sunday. Tomorrow, I'm supposed to give a small presentation to my project team... and I haven't the foggiest idea about what I'm going to blabber about. Absolutely no preparation! ... I'm just gonna shoot my mouth off!  *LOL*   Hmm, lets see whats new on the blogging scene...   urlLink Richa  got a new layout that looks really cool...  so does her new haircut! .  urlLink Amrita  is down with flu  (Get well soon!!!) .  urlLink Suku  has been changing her layouts nearly everyday...  (Suku, the pink one was not bad! ... but I prefer the current one!) . Hey  urlLink Sindhu , my fingers are crossed for your mom!  By the way, I was chatting with  Rochelle  today and she said that Librans tend to have dimples...  *LOL* , I dunno how valid this is!  What else?? ... ummm... nothing much! ... So see you all around later, folks! Take care!  cheers!

       A weekend in the life of a Libran  Have you ever seen a person walk into a room and everybody turns to look at him/her. He/she will probably be dressed to perfection, have a laugh that's sheer music to the ears and will dazzle you with his/her smile. And you might just be left wondering what just hit you now! He/she in all probability is a  Libran .    *LOL* ... thats what  urlLink MSN  says while giving brief overview of the characteristics that set the Librans apart. Furthermore, Librans, as easy-going people, they tend to procrastinate and take the easy route in doing things. Luxury is always a welcome addition to their life since they have a pronounced aversion to high-pressure situations!!  Hmmm... maybe that explains why I love weekends. And especially those relaxing and  lie-back-in-the-easy-chair  kind of weekends.  Friday, I went home early because the the roads were supposed to get blocked in the evenings due to the  Ganpati Visarjan  processions. So, the moment I reached home I flung myself on the bed and was dead to the world for something like three hours.  zzzzzzzzzzz!! . Then, saw some live telecast of  Ganesh Visarjan  on TV. Earlier, till as recent as couple of years back, I used to go out and watch the  Visarjan  processions at Dadar  Chowpatty . But the tasteless manner in which some fools in these processions dance has put me off. I prefer to stay at home and watch the live telecast from places like Pune, where the processions are much more disciplined and traditional.  aaahhh!! ... why do I sound like an old man?!!!  ;-)   They were showing  Good Will Hunting  on a movie channel on Friday night. Saw it! ... Its a good movie, with some very powerful dialogues and some very watchable  one-on-one  scenes between Matt Damon and Robin Williams. But frankly speaking, I've seen better movies...  heh heh heh! ... very diplomatic, n'est-ce pas! ... very Libraesque! ;-)   Saturday was kinda funny! ... I don't remember how it passed... as if it never happened... as if I slept on Friday night and woke up directly on Sunday morning!! ...  strange! ... strange indeed!!   One thing I remember about Saturday, though! I remember having gone to have my hair trimmed. But I must've fallen asleep in the chair as the barber went to work on my hair. I guess he must've used garden shears, because at the end of the ordeal, I was left with hair so short that they stand out from the scalp like pin-pricks... making me look like a complete idiot... a dork!!  *grrrrr* . Now, just to take the attention away from the massacre on the top, I've kept a little goatee. But, that doesn't suit me as well. My head and my chin, both having very little hair at the moment, are driving me nuts everytime I happen to glance in a mirror!!  Mirror, mirror... on the wall! ... Who's the dorkest of them all?! .... thats me!!!!   The first thing I remember about Sunday is rain... lots of it... at dawn!! The sheer racket that the heavy rain made, woke me up at dawn. Fortunately, I managed to drift back into sleep easily and woke up to a bright and sunny Sunday! ... Mumbai has moderate climate they say! ...  bah! . The only reminder of the heavy rain in the night was the slightly damp ground and dead phones!  Having nothing to do on a Sunday morning, I made my way to  Sunderbai Hall  at Churchgate. They had a book exhibition with 15 to 50 % discount on the books on display. I bought a few books including Khushwant Singh's  A Train to Pakistan  and Vikram Seth's  An Equal Music . Vikram Seth's book was an impulse buy... I really have no idea as to how it is. I think it would be good! But then, I realize that a Libran's admiration for aesthetics is legendary whether it is music, art or people. Because of their admiration for all things beautiful, they would be inclined to judge a book by its cover.  Sunday ended with a bang! ... Quite literally!! ... India was playing a crunch-time match against England in Colombo and the result was gonna decide the semi-finalist in the mini-world cup. And ohh my God!! ... Virender Sehwag just blasted the England bowlers to smithereens!... It was an absolute massacre as bowler after England bowler was tried out but each of them could only act as cannon fodder for Sehwag as he blazed away to a century off just 77 balls. Simply amazing!... South Africa... better watch out!! ;-)  Well, that about sums up my weekend. More later! ... But just before I take your leave, here's a parting thought!...  A Libran in love  can be a combination of some of the best characteristics in the zodiac: a sensuous Taurus, a romantic Pisces, and a melting Leo. oooh! ... I didn't know that! ... Ofkors... never had the opportunity to try it out! ...  *LOL*  .... well, now... any volunteers?!  cheers!

       Here's the new layout!  Ok, ppl... here's the new layout! ... a couple of credits are due here...  The original template is from  urlLink BlogSkins . I have done some tweaking to it to customize it to my needs. Actually quite some tweaking was needed and this isn't your average 3-minute  slam-bam-thank-you-maam  job of changing the layout with a readymade template! ;-)  Next credit goes to  urlLink Suku  because it was from her site that I was  inspired  to put up my kiddy pic!  *LOL*   So, then... browse around the new layout and please let me know of any views on that... and please don't hold back while expressing those views!! ;-)  Well, tomorrow  i.e. 5th October , is the day that I came into existence in this world exactly 26 years ago!  (yeah!!... you heard that right!... 26!!! ...an absolute oldie!!!) . And as the years are pssing, I'm getting more and more worried when my birthday arrives. And that is because, I'm afraid that the candles on my birthday cake would create so much smoke that the people from the  Pollution Control Board  might come knocking on my door!! If you don't know what I'm talking about... have a look at this!...        Ok, then ppl... gotta be going! ... see you all again pretty soon! :-)  cheers!

       Workaholics Anonymous ;-)  You know, sometimes we get stuck over problem and then simply can't breathe easy till that problem is solved. Thats what happened to me today. I had been trying to debug  (I guess, even the people who don't know even the T of Technology would know the word  debug )  an especially irritating problem. Irritating because everything seemed alright and there seemed to be no reason for it to  not work . But work, it did not!   Finally, today afternoon... seemingly out of nowhere, I got a weird feeling that if I tried it  this  way, it might just work! So I set about following my instincts and  voila! ... it worked! ... I mean, not completely... but I got the damned thing underway and on the road to successful completion! Funny!! ... how these things come to you when you're least expecting a breakthrough! :-)  So, the bottomline is... I've had a busy day! And I love such busy days when I'm totally involved in the work and forget about everything around me. Its just me and the PC... everything else is just a blur! If you think I'm exaggerating, you should ask some of my team-mates from my previous project team... umm... for example  Rochelle . These guys used to think I'm some sort of robot who never got up from his seat, even for lunch or even to visit the loo  *LOL* . Strange! ... because, my friends in school used to call me  Giant Robot  ... heh heh! ... anybody remembers that Japanese animatronic TV series,  Giant Robot , that they used to show on Doordarshan many many years back?!! ;-)  But a rider to this situation is that the work that I'm busy with, should be work that I really like to do. Unlike the situation a few days back when I was supposed to fill up my performance appraisal form. Now that was boring, mundane and mechanical work... something that I hate!    *LOL*  ... enuf boasting about my work habits and work ethic! Sorry ppl!... I sometimes do go on a loooong ego trip! ;-D  Hmm... why does today feel like a Monday?!! ... I was even tempted to fill up my weekly timesheet just because I thought today was Monday. Yesterday's mid-week holiday passed in a blur. The only thing that I managed to do yesterday was to go out birthday shopping  (yeeaah! ... two days to go for the D-Day... uhh... I mean the B-Day!) . I wanted to buy myself a  Kurta ... so I went to  Fabindia  at Bandra. But, it was closed...  darn!! . Since I did not want to waste the trip, I then went to  Globus  and picked up a Tee-shirt and pair of jeans. Now the only thing that remains to be bought is a Kurta... which means that another trip to Fabindia is in order! :-)  Today morning, I found that the  urlLink enetation  commenting system was down... and lots of comments that you wonderful people had left on my previous blog were nowhere to be seen. So, I went over to  urlLink HaloScan  and registered there for their commenting system and put it up on my page. So, from now on... whenever enetation is down I'll be switching over to HaloScan. Well... that just goes to show how much I value your comments!! :-)  As I had said in one of my previous blogs, I'll be changing the layout soon. So, in the next couple of days, if you access this page and find it hopefully out of shape, then don't worry... it's just me trying to juggle around with CSS, HTML, and other such stuff! ;-)  Well, then! ... thats it for now... see you all tomorrow!  cheers!   P.S. : For those who wanted my email id to send me b'day cards  (heh heh!... I like b'day cards!!) , it is super_sam5 at yahoo dot com. ;-)

       Feeling Hot Hot Hot!!  It hurts!! ... It hits you and then it hurts!!  I'm talking about the heat wave that is currently sweeping Mumbai... leaving in its wake, a trail of sweaty bodies!  After having my lunch today, I set off for a customary  after-lunch-walk  with my  lunch-mates . The moment I stepped outside, a blast of warm air hit me squarely in the face. I felt as though I had stepped into a furnace  (well, to be completely frank, I've never stepped inside a furnace... never had the oppportunity to do so!) *LOL* . The brilliant sunshine and the glare that it caused forced me to squint my eyes as I steeped out of the shade. If the heat in the shade was bad, it was like hell out into the open, under the sun. The heat enveloped the body and held a tight vice-like grip on it. My ears and the back of my neck burned under the scorching heat and almost in no time, sweat was pouring down in the form of tiny rivulets. Through my squinted eyes, I could see the hot air rising up from the ground, causing a shimmering pattern in the distance.  Damn! , I thought,  it was too hot to take a walk!! ... so I promptly turned back and headed straight to the cool, centrally air-conditioned environment of the office building. Its just the first day of October and the dreaded  October Heat  is already making its presence felt!!  But... I'm not complaining!! October is my favouritest month of the year and this week the favouritest week!!! ;-)  Well anyways, tomorrow's a holiday  (we'll be paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi's memory on his birth anniversary tomorrow, by taking a day off from work!) . And I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to spend the day tomorrow. It is too hot outside to even think about spending the day outdoors. And indoors, apart from fooling around on the PC, I can't foresee anything to do. There's nothing particularly good on TV... in fact, if at all, there are lots of reasons why I should not watch TV! One of the chief reasons is that nowadays, whenever you turn on the TV, there will invariably be some  f***-all  soap opera going on.What makes these soaps even worse is that they all look the same... same plot... same actors... same sets... same producers... even the names starting with the same letter of the alphabet  (and there are no prizes for guessing which letter that is!) . Fortunately, I haven't watched even a single episode of any of these soaps... otherwise there would have been utter  K aos in my mind. Apart from these boring soaps, the thing that bugs me the most on TV is this particular music video by a new group called the  Band of Boys , which seems to be on heavy rotation these days on the music channels. It simply grates on my nerves and I feel as if I might cause someone bodily harm if I cannot lay my hands on the remote, fast enough, to change the channels when this particular video comes on air. This  Band of Boys  is by no means a Band of Boys!! ... In fact, the group should be called  Band of 30-Plus-Men . I dunno how other people feel, but I have a suspicion that they would not  (and should not)  go beyond their first album. But thats besides the point! ... The point is that...there's nothing worthwhile to watch on TV ... except perhaps... the live telecast of the Busan Asian Games.  Forget TV... I think I might go shopping in the evening tomorrow! Plus, I have a treat coming up as well. One of my friends,  Faizan , is treating me to a dinner tomorrow, because he got a good score in the GMAT test that he recently gave. It'll probably be at the  Gypsy  restaurant at Shivaji Park. :-)  Yesterday evening was another disappointment as far as cricket is concerned. It rained heavily once again... just as the Indians had started their reply to the Sri Lankan challenge of 223. The rain prevented the match from being completed and so, the prize,  the mini world-cup , was shared by the two teams, India and Sri Lanka. :-((  Now... lets see what people are doing on the blogging scene.  urlLink Richa  and  urlLink Sindhu  are creating  cliques  by the dozens.  urlLink Amrita 's PC is still down while its being upgraded.  urlLink Suku  is as usual, posting some wonderfully written posts. All's well with the world!  So, there! ... thats all that I have time and inclination for today! Be back with something different next time around!... And hey, I guess I'm getting tired of this layout... so I'll probably change this layout before the week is out! ... so be on the lookout for a changed layout and when it happens, feel free to criticize it!  Over and out!!  cheers!   P.S. : Isn't it ironical that I managed to solve the JavaScript error from  urlLink Shuchita 's webpage... but then, found that my page has started giving a JavaScript error!! :-|  *LOL*

       I'm OK, You're OK ... ;-)  I have absolutely no idea what came over me when I posted my previous blog!! Now, when I read it... I feel a bit foolish  *smiling sheepishly*   Actually, nothing drastic happened to me... no disappointments... no rejections  (not now anyways!) ... no failures... no nothing! Its just that something just nudged my mood off-balance in the afternoon on Saturday and there I was... feeling a bit down and sullen. And as the afternoon morphed into evening... my mood didn't get much better. I'm not sure what was the cause. I'm not usually a moody person...  (goes with the zodiac sign, I guess!) , so it was a surprise that I actually posted what I posted on Saturday!! :-)  Well, anyways, once I reached home somnething happened that changed my mood right back!  A couple of months back, someone from our company had sent out an SOS via email appealing for AB+ blood for her relative  (a Mrs. Fernandes)  who was then being treated in the ICU of the Leelavati Hospital in Bandra. Now,  AB  is rare blood group and on top of it, there was a shortage of AB+ blood. Yours truly is AB+. So, I volunteered and donated blood. Saturday evening as I reached home I found that I had received a card from Mrs. Fernandes thanking me for donating the blood. First of all, I was glad that she was alright now and secondly, I thought this was a really sweet gesture  i.e. sending a card . This immediately perked up my mood and I was back to normal!! ... Strange how these things happen!! ... there I was in the afternoon feeling depressed due to some nebulous reasons... and then there I was in the evening, mood restored due to happiness coming in from unexpected quarters! ...  C'est la vie  ... Its nothing more than a journey in which you just have to keep an eye out for the small joys that come your way... when you see one... gently clasp it in your hands and marvel at the glow that it casts and the smile that it manages to bring to your face!! ... then move along... looking for another!!  Too senti... is it?!  *LOL*   Sunday dawned and I was dead to the world! ... for a person who wakes up at 5:30 AM every morning, sleeping till 9:00 AM is a luxury...  almost a sin!  Then, I put my feet up, picked up the newspaper and headed straight for the cartoons page! Reading the comics,  especially my favourite, Garfield , is the first thing I do every Sunday morning. Then, I took a late bath followed by an early lunch  (not quite brunch... but early all the same!) . After that I settled down to see the final match between India and Sri Lanka.  I was disappointed that Saurav Ganguly lost the toss and had to bowl first. I would have loved to see the Indians bat up front. But the Indian bowlers bowled well and restricted the Sri Lankans to 244 in 50 overs. And then, when it was the Indians' turn to bat, the rain gods who had relented during the past 15 days refused to do so any longer and the skies burst open soaking the ground. The play was called off and it was decided to replay the entire match today. Well, today almost the same things happened... Sri Lankans won the toss and wanted to bat first. Sanath Jayasuriya was bowled off the very first ball of the match and in the end Sri Lanka managed to get 222 off their quota of 50 overs. The Indians have come out to bat and as I write this blog, the score is 6 for the loss of 1 wicket. They've just lost the first wicket and I hope that they don't lose any more!!! :-)  Well, anyways... thats it for today I guess! ... Thanks to all those commented on yesterday's blog, asking if I was okay!! ... Thanks!!   cheers!

       A day at Wankhede...  The other day when  urlLink Amrita  said that she'd gone to Wankhede stadium to see the match, I sighed and wished that I could go too! But office beckoned and the prospect of leaving the house early in the morning to go and stand in the ticket-queue was simply not appealing enough! All I could manage was another sigh... and life continued!  So, as soon as I reached home, imagine my joy when my father thrust two passes, to the  Garware Pavilion  at the Wankhede stadium, in my face!! Well... what do you know?!!... a wish come true!!  (I thought... damn! I should've wished for something grander than this!!)  ;-)  So, thats how I found myself being frisked by the policeman at the Vinoo Mankad Gate of the stadium, the next day  i.e.  yesterday. The security was tight and I had to walk through a metal detector followed by a manual frisking. While being frisked, the constable's hands found the pack of  Alpenliebe  that I was carrying in my pocket. He immediately demanded to know what it was and so I handed over the pack to him for a closer examination.   "Chinggum nahi chalega sahab!"    "Arre yeh chewing-gum nahi hai" , I tried to explain,  "lekin, chewing gum kyu nahi cahlta?"    "Ab kya bolega sahab, public chinggum khaake seat per chipka deta hai" , he lamented.   "Ohhh, achcha!... aap yeh khaake dekho na, yeh chewing-gum nahi hai!!" , I offered him the caramel candy from the pack, which he promptly palmed and gestured me to proceed towards the stadium. I complied and made my way to the stands where I chose the best possible seat and made myself at home and settled down to watch the players practising on the ground just before the scheduled start of the day's proceedings!  The play started at its scheduled time and almost before people coming in had settled down, Sachin Tendulkar, in a moment of lost concentration cut a ball too close to his body and was caught behind. The boisterous crowd, eager to see pyrotechnics from the bat of the veteran of 101 tests, was stunned into silence. More silence followed a few minutes later as Saurav Ganguly got a contentious LBW decision and had to return back to the dressing room, leaving Rahul Dravid  a.k.a.  The Wall at the crease with VVS Laxman. The two then batted sensibly, trying to recover from a precarious position.  While the cricket continued on the ground at a snail's pace, the crowd tried to amuse themselves by jeering Dillon and Cuffy. Some common slogans and chants were...  "Dillon is a bastard!" ,  "Dillon sucks!" ,  "Dillon is a homo!" ,  "Sabse gora bachcha kaun... Cuffy - Cuffy!!" ,  "Inky Pinky Ponky... Cuffy is a donkey!" . It was quite juvenile and asinine on the part of the crowd to insult the visitors this way!! Dillon just added fuel to the fire by surreptitiously showing  the finger  to the spectators. Surreptitiously... because he didn't want the TV cameras catching him in the act!  As the action on the ground slowed down to a crawl, I busied myself with one of my favourite outdoor activity... people-watching! Well, some people watch birds... some watch wild animals... I watch  (or rather observe)  people! Don't get me wrong!... this isn't staring or ogling!... Its more like an academic observation. Oh well! ... I dunno if I can explain, what it is!... so forget it!  The man seating immediately in front of me was an immensely corpulent gentleman who was reading Irving Stone's biography of Michelangelo,  The Agony and the Ecstasy . He was also sipping on a glass of  Mirinda  as he toggled his attention  between reading the book and following the cricket. Suddenly, Javagal Srinath replied to Cuffy's stare, by hoisting a belligerent six over long-off. The man set his book and the soft-drink down on the seat and jumped up to clap and cheer Srinath. A fly that was hovering in the vicinity, saw its chance and landed on the rim of the glass. The lure of the brightly coloured Mirinda proved to be too much to resist as it started its descent into the glass by going around the inside surface like a motorcycle rider does inside the  Maut-ka-Kua  in a fair. It had almost reached the liquid, when the man had enough of cheering and sat down heavily on the seat... picked up the glass and downed the remaining Mirinda in a single gulp! ...  Poor fly!!   Among the vast multitude of people, my eyes were drawn towards someone who was arguably the cutest girl in the Garware Pavilion! She was gorgeous!!... and she sat about four rows directly in front of me. She was sitting with her boy-friend and a few other friends. Everytime she smiled, her entire face lit up and she looked even more cute!... if that was possible! ;-)  On second thoughts though, the cutest girl in the entire Garware Pavilion sat right next to me on her father's lap!! She must've been not more than 3 or 4 years old and she was listening wide-eyed to her father's explanation of the nuances of cricket.... bowling, batting, boundaries, wickets... etc! Everytime she saw something on the field that her father had just taught her... she would excitedly point it out to him with a cherubic smile on her face! ... :-))  Well, back to the action on the field... Dravid just about managed to complete his century  (can you believe it!!... his fourth on the trot!!) , before he cramped up and collapsed on the ground due to dehydration and exhaustion. He was carried off the field and had to be put on a  drip  so that he could be re-hydrated and could regain his lost strength. That marked an end to a typical Rahul Dravid innings... gritty, patient and invaluable!  In the evening, at close of play, West Indies found themselves in trouble having lost two wickets without many runs on the board. I returned home exhausted... in small part due to the extremely hot weather and largely due to the shouting and clapping I did during the day. After a bath, I slept till mom called for dinner. After the dinner, a quick check-up of the emails I had got during the day and then it was back to the bed as I could barely keep my eyes open!  All in all... a day well spent and a day definitely worth bunking the office! ;-)  Ok then... just before I sign off for the day... a  Get Well Soon  wish for  urlLink Suku  who is down with fever and exhaustion!!  cheers!

       I want...  Yesterday I had a dose of  gripe water  before I got down to write the blog. Thats why you saw a sneak preview of my hate list. I'll probably publish the list in its entirety some other time.  Today however I'm in a greedy mood... and so I present a very brief list of things that I want to possess ASAP... here goes!  * a new cell-phone! The ancient  (but trusty!)  Nokia 3210 that I have at present is much too bulky for my liking and it hardly possesses the features that everybody around me is so proud of boasting! And this 3210 causes a very conspicuous bulge when I carry it in my trouser pockets. I was mightily impressed by the brand new 6510 that my friend was brandishing today! * a new watch! I'm bored with my  very staid looking  Titan timepiece that has been adorning my wrist for quite some time now! A shiny new Swatch would be just the right replacement! * an upgrade to P-4 for my home PC. And with it a list of other accessories that my PC has been crying out for... a graphics card that lets me play RPGs without freezing up... a webcam/digicam... a cd-writer... a USB port to hook-up all these goodies and others that don't come to my mind right now! * a broadband Net connection at home. fast and always-on connectivity!! * a new frame for my glasses. Actually, no frame for my glasses!!... I mean I wanna have rimless glasses.  This is again... just a sample list... the actual list is much... much longer!! Only problem, now, is the moolah  (more so the lack of it!)  to help me finance my wants. Contribute generously to  Sam's Feed the Greed  fund!! ;-)  And ohhh... there are other things that I need that money can't buy!! ... u know... the usual suspects! Contributions are also welcome to assuage those needs of mine!  *LOL*   Well, enuf of this  Me, Myself and Sam  outlook that has taken over this blog!  The first test match between India and the touring West Indians began today in the absolutely hopeless heat of Mumbai  (added to this is the fact that Wankhede is a closed stadium, a fact that precludes the idea of a breeze blowing across the ground!) . The hapless West Indians were subjected to torture when the Indian openers put up a double century opening partnership with Virender Sehwag  (the latest wunderkind)  blazing his way to 147. They had to resort to as many as nine bowlers during the day!! It was so frustrating for the Windies bowlers that Mervyn Dillon showed  the finger  to the crowd on more than one occasion.  urlLink Amrita  was amongst the crowd, at Wankhede today, that sledged Dillon till he displayed the universal gesture of frustration! Well, tomorrow promises to be a run-feast with Dravid and Tendulkar on show from the first ball in the morning!!  Among other things, the Salman Khan episode took a turn for the comical when it was announced after investigation that the Land Cruiser that he plowed into those poor victims, was in fact a stolen vehicle!! Now, how much more illegal can you get!! ... A sozzled superstar with a history of misdemeanours, driving a stolen vehicle, without a driving license crashes into a street corner bakery killing a poor man sleeping there and injuring three others!! :-|  Ok... I should stop rambling on without any purpose and take your leave now!...  cheers!   P.S. : I got myself registered at  urlLink BlogHop . So, now you people can rate this site! ...  *LOL*  ... nothing worth rating!!... I know! But even so... rate me!! ;-) Just under the cliques you will find a list of smileys that you need to choose from, to rate this page. So... do it!! :-D

       Peeves, updates and an old lady  Since I'm in a mood to gripe... I will do just that!  * I hate the  Dandia  which is right now being played in the canteen of our office. Now who in their right mind would even think of having a Dandia session in an office!! ... and that too with a live orchestra and the works! * I hate the heat. Can you imagine that the temperature here in Mumbai went over 38 C (over 100 F) today!! Its awful and its evil!! * I hate myself for not having the enthusiasm and the inclination to go to the gym. I know I should... but I don't! * I hate when I am at loss for the right word at the right time. I just go blank sometimes when trying to recollect  that  perfect word to describe a particular thing. Afterwards though, that word comes to me at the weirdest of times...  e.g. while waking up from sleep at dawn... or in the middle of an unrelated conversation... or worse still... while I'm sitting on the toilet seat  (don't wrinkle your noses! ... that is one place where I get a lot of ideas!!)  * I hate reading news like  urlLink this ... especially when you know that turmeric has been used since centuries in India to cure many kinds of  malaises , including burns. Well, I have seen turmeric being used to fix a leaky fuel tank in a car!! * I hate this guy in our office who insists on chatting with me on IM on topics like the  racial inferiority of Indians  and  reasons why India as a 3rd world country is among the scum of the earth . I really hate it!!... especially since he is a colleague in the office and I can't ask him to  go take a hike . * I hate ...  Well... the list is long and I don't want to spread anymore hate in the world! ;-)  Among other things... a minor update to this page. Couple of things have been added today...  The first thing is a Mumbai weather indicator at the bottom of the page  (a totally inconsequential addition to the page!) . The second newly added item is a list of movies I have reviewed for our company's online magazine. Its there... just below  brainless rants  and just above  random site-ings ... to the left of the page. Finally, the third item that finds a place on this page is a small daily feature called  groaner's corner  situated just below  random site-ings . This will feature a PJ or a groaner daily ...  (well, you have to bear the frustration of reading some absolutely ugghh PJs!) .  Just before I take your leave for the day, here's an incident that I witnessed in the bus yesterday while coming to the office...  I was sitting in the bus trying to read a book. An elderly Gujarati  (I deduced this from the way she was wearing her saree)  lady sat in the seat directly in front of me. She was enjoying the sights of early morning Mumbai as they whizzed past while the bus sped along SV Road. Some time later, one guy came and sat next to her. He too was an elderly gentleman, though not as advanced in age as the lady he sat next to. And in no time, he started conversing with the old lady... well actually it was a one-sided conversation as the man talked and talked about trivial things like the price of bus tickets, the weather, the rude bus-conductors, etc. The lady listened with amazing attentiveness and nodded a few times as the man entered an especially animated part of his monologue. Finally... I guess the lady had to get down at her destination. So, she smiled at the man... reached into her purse... took out the ear-piece of her hearing-aid... put it on... and got off the bus!  I just threw back my head and silently laughed as hard as I could!! I still had the smile on my face asl I walked into the office... a very rare thing to see on a Monday morning!! ;-)  cheers!

      Something that I wrote some time back. Enjoy!!...    Disclaimer : I have nothing against Pune!! ... in fact I love the city! ;-)     While in Pune      . . . ... it's better to own a two-wheeler . If you don't, you could be looked down upon!   ... never drive a two-wheeler without a face mask . No, this isn't some sophisticated contraption to reduce pollution. It's just a scarf wound around the face in such a way that only the eyes are visible. This 'haute-couture' is practised by the female populace of Pune while riding two-wheelers (who needs all those sun-blocks with TPFs and anti-UV formulae when you have a scarf!!)   ... speak Marathi . If you don't then be ready to get blank stares...though some of the Pune population has, under the guise of cosmopolitizing (is that a word?!) started speaking other languages.... a blasphemous notion for the 'assal punekar'.   ... visit Vaishali . No, that isn't some lady don that you have to pay a visit to. It's the most popular hangout of Punekar youth on this side of the river. Well, it's basically a restaurant... but it's more of a place to meet than a place to eat.   ... order food items using abbreviations . The waiter will laugh at you on your face if you don't order Sev Potato Dahi Puri as SPDP or Masala Dosa as MD.   ... call the 'nallah' that flows through the city, a river . The river flowing right through the city can be called a river only during the rainy season. At other times it shrinks to a measly nallah. So much so, that they've built roads on the dry river bed so that people can drive/walk on them during non-rainy seasons.   ... embellish trivial things . Pune is a city of supermarkets! Well, don't get carried away. The street corner grocer in Mumbai becomes a supermarket in Pune. A smaller sized grocery shop becomes a mini-market.   ... make sure you enter shops well before their closing times . Even a chemist will refuse to sell you an emergency medicine because it is 5 seconds past the closing down time!  ... as a corollary to the above point,  make it a point to never try and go to a shop exactly at the time it is supposed to open . The shopkeeper's timepiece runs in a different time zone altogether. Its not uncommon to see a crowd gathered outside a shop in the morning waiting for the owner to come and open the shutters ("Customer is the king"...no way!... not here in Pune!!)   ... take a siesta in the afternoon . Afternoons are for naps. Working or doing business in the afternoon is an unheard of notion for our Punekars.    ... don't rely on public transport buses . Ask me! ... I've spent hours waiting for a bus which never comes because PMT believes that cancelling buses at the drop of a hat is their holy duty.   ... ensure that rickshaw drivers don't take you for a ride . Well, they just use your ignorance about the city to take you to your destination by weaving through the lanes. Also do make sure that you pay by a correct tariff card. Twice, I have nearly paid fantastic fares because the rickshaw driver tried to charge me using a Mumbai taxi tariff card!!   ... enjoy your stay . Whatever people say about Pune's transformation into a second Mumbai, it still is a quaint place to stay, with a reeeaaaally laidback lifestyle.     cheers!

       FUBAR and the cold within...  Have had hardly anytime today to think anything other than the work at hand. Occasionally when I took small breaks, I did manage to visit and comment on some of the fine blogs that I visit daily. But apart from that... absolutely no respite from the work. For the major part of the day, I was  FUBAR  to the max! Facing a deadline, I had not managed to achieve any breakthrough in correcting a freakish bug in the software. Finally... at 1700 hrs... a braincild was born!! A bulb in my head lit up brightly! ...  (so bright that you could almost see the rays coming out of my ears and nostrils!) ... And by 17:20, I had managed to squash the bug and got the code to work as it was supposed to!...  Whew!! ... just 10 minutes before the deadline... this was the closest that I ever got to a deadline without overrunning it!...  *looks upto the sky and thanks the guardian angel* ... Thanks buddy! :-)  And, I have to run home now... today's my dad's birthday!!!...  Happy Birthday Papa!!... you are the greatest!!   Before going... I'll post a poem that I got in e-mail today... its supposed to be by an anonymous poet...   The Cold Within  by: Author Unknown, Source Unknown    Six humans trapped by happenstance  In black and bitter cold.  Each one possessed a stick of wood,  Or so the story's told.   Their dying fire in need of logs,  The first woman held hers back  For on the faces around the fire,  She noticed one was black.   The next man looking cross the way  Saw one not of his church,  And couldn't bring himself to give  The fire his stick of birch.   The third man sat in tattered clothes;  He gave his coat a hitch.  Why should his log be put to use  To warm the idle rich?   The rich man just sat back and thought  Of the wealth he had in store.  And how to keep what he had earned  From the lazy poor.   The black man's face bespoke revenge  As the fire passed from his sight,  For all he saw in his stick of wood  Was a chance to spite the white.   And the last man of this forlorn group  Did naught except for gain.  Giving only to those who gave  Was how he played the game.   The logs held tight in death's still hands  Was proof of human sin.  They didn't die from the cold without,  They died from the cold within.    Think abt it!!  Have a fab weekend ppl!!... and Cheers!   P.S. : Hey ppl... go and congratulate  urlLink Amrita !!... she won a web-site designing contest today!! :-))

       Its raining birthdays!!...  Well... Blogger seems to be in fine shape today!... Yesterday, it was down and I could not publish my entry. So, it was only today morning that I managed to publish yesterday's entry!...hmmm... all's well that ends well...  or so it is alleged!   Yesterday evening, I managed to huff and puff my way into Shopper's Stop at Andheri(W), after the company bus dropped me off on the east side of the station. Its really hot and stuffy here in Mumbai, and I'm getting a bit out of shape, nowadays!. Plus, the shirt I was wearing yesterday did not lend itself well to sweat. As a result, I was almost embarassed to enter the store with my shirt soaking in sweat and showing it! Well, enter I did!... and made my way to the top floor which houses the cavernous premises of Planet M. I wanted to pick up a couple of VCDs for my sister on her birthday. Having searched high and low...  (literally!) , I enquired at the helpdesk, only to be informed that the VCD of  Shrek  was out of stock... and had been for quite some time!. Sheesh!!... now thats the third time I've been made to hear this line while trying to buy Shrek's VCD... I mean.. can't they stock up?!!... and Shrek was a majorly famous movie!!! ... But that was quite as apparent when I asked one of the salesmen there about where I could find Shrek. He asked me to repeat the name twice since he could not make out what I was asking. And then when he got the name of the movie... he stared at me with a dumbass look and asked... "Is it an English movie?!!" ... Well....:-\  So, I made my way to  Merwans ... to buy the cake! As usual, the tiny shop was filled to the brim and overflowing... its air-conditioning system struggling gallantly to keep its cool. I had to wait while the couple of guys before me were trying to decide what cake to buy... and were having a hard time deciding! Finally, when my turn arrived, I had no hesitation in selecting the Lemon Crackle cake.... its heavenly!! :-) ... and that too... juuust Rs. 180/- for 1 Kg... which is really peanuts if you've been accustomed to buying your cakes from the  much-hyped-up  Birdy's. And the thing that takes the cake at Birdy's is that those despicable little misers charge extra for getting the name written on the cake!!... well... what can I say!!? :-|  The bus ride back to home was painfully slow... partly due to the traffic jams along SV road and partly due to the mouth-watering aroma, wafting out of the box that I was carrying on my lap, which played tricks with my hungry stomach! ;-)  When I got off at my stop, I had to do one more thing before reaching home. I had to buy my sister a wind-chime...  well, you know... all that Feng-Shui and stuff! . So, then I went to this store called  Nirmitee  which is quite close to our house. They have some wonderful stuff if you want to buy some art stuff... handicrafts, antiques, idols, etc. There, I bought a lovely  ethnic chic  wind-chime... and had it gift-wrapped!  After reaching home, I found my sis and my parents, waiting for the cake. After the customary clapping and singing  Happy Birthday to youuuuu , my sis cut the cake and I had a grand time plastering her face with the soft lemon flavoured icing!! ;-)  The wind-chime immediately found itself hanging in the window of the living room. But, since the weather was stuffy and nearly completely wind-less... we could not enjoy the tinkling of the chimes! Normally, it would have made a racket... tinkling away to glory in the stiff breeze that carries into our sea-facing living room.  The next thing I knew was that I had a plate in my hands with generous quantity of  ragda patties  that my mom had made. And almost before I had finished that... came another helping. Following that... I was subjected to lots of sweets and ice-cream. At the end of it... I was practically immobilized with a full stomach and an inertia against motion that comes along with it! ;-)  Well, I didn't have anything more to do anyways... so I slept!... Strangely, it was a nice deep sleep... unlike the fitful slumber that usually ensues after an especially heavy meal. And, I was thankful for that!! :-)  Thats all about yesterday! I guess I blogged more about my sister's birthday than I had done about mine!... *LOL*   Today was a very busy day at the office!... and since the problem that I was solving today has remained insoluble tiil now, I can see that another busy day beckons tomorrow! But... I enjoy it when I'm busy with work!! :-)  Another thing that made yesterday special was that I got a call from my friend from Pune after  God-knows-how-many  months!! And it came totally out of the blue!! He's supposed to fly to Toronto this Saturday and would be in Mumbai to catch the flight. He said he was gonna spend the Saturday evening in a guest-house and wanted to meet me before he left. I almost shouted at him and told him that no way was he gonna spend time in the guest house and asked him to come to my place. So, I'm looking forward to Saturday!  Hmmm... for the moment though... thats all I have to blog about!... more tomorrow! :-)  cheers!

      This was supposed to be published about 15-16 hours back when it was still yesterday here!  *LOL* ... anyways...   To buy a cell...  Seems like Blogger is having some problems while posting. Or maybe... its just me!!  So... a short and simple blog 2de!  I finally went out and bought myself a new cell-phone! ... a  Nokia 6510 !! ... Its a beauty!!... I mean, looks-wise, its no big shakes, but its crammed with lotsa features and goodies! Its got a phone-book with space for 500 entries, each with the name, upto 3 phone nos, address, e-mail id and homepage. Then, it has space enough to store 150 SMS text messages. Its got calendar, a to-do list, voice-dialling, voice-commands, voice-recorder, stopwatch, alarm clock, GPRS mode, its WAP enabled, infra-red port, yadda... yadda!! ... Another great feature is that its got a FM radio!! :-))  My trousers are still smoking, though, after this 6510 burnt a small hole in my pockets!! ... It set me back by Rs. 15,500. But for the features it has, I guess thats a fair enough price to pay for it. Too bad, unlike some people, no one gifts me cell-phones!! ... (*LOL*... just kidding... just kidding!!)   For a long time in the shop, I was confused... since the saleswoman showed me lotsa phones of different brands. In the end, it came down to making a choice between Nokia 6510 and Motorola V60. I selected the Nokia model since I am not very comfortable with flip-top phones!  Well, anyways... I'm still getting used to the functions on 6510.  Today is my sister's birthday!!... Happy Birthday to her!!!... I have to leave early from office today, since I'll be picking up the cake from a cake-shop in Andheri and then I'm planning to visit Shopper's Stop to hunt for some gifts for her. Tell, me... has anyone tried the cakes from   Merwans   at Andheri??... They are absolutely yummy!!... way better than big names like, Birdy's and Monginis!!  So... thats it for now!! ... more later!... gotta go and select a nice cake! ;-)  cheers!

       Traditionally speaking, ofkors!  Writing a blog after a thoroughly boring weekend!... Usually I find something to keep myself occupied and entertained through the weekend. But this particular weekend was an exception to this as I could do nothing other than laze about the house doing absolutely nothing. My non-existant social life contributed handsomely to the sense of boredom. And I could only wait for the weekend to pass and for Monday to arrive  (I can't believe I actually was looking forward to Monday!!)   Actually this Monday was indeed something of a day to look forward to...  Tomorrow being  urlLink Dussehra  and a holiday, we had a  Traditional Day  in our office today. We were expected to turn up for work dressed up in traditional attire! As usual, the fickle mind of a Libran took over in the morning and I was unable to decide whether to go in for a traditional dress  (what exactly constitutes a traditional dress!!?)  or the everyday clothes! Finally, I settled for the conservative choice and came to the office dressed  normally . After reaching the office I saw that most of the ladies looking lovely in sarees and guys looking cool in their Kurtas and pyjamas. Suddenly I felt as though I should've worn the Kurta! But then, I reasoned that these people were not really wearing their tradtional dresses... just  ethnic  clothing!! Whats the difference?!... Plenty!  Traditional dressing connotes dressing up the way your ancestors have dressed up, historically speaking. Ethnic clothing has to do with dressing up in a way that has been established by a ethnic group over a period of time. It means, even though I am a Maharashtrian, I could dress up as a Kutchi peasant and claim that I'm dressed in ethnic clothing. But, if I'm asked to dress traditionally, I would need to dress up as my ancestors have done. Typically that would involve wearing a  dhoti , a  Kurta , a  pagdi   (a pagdi not like the way Sikhs wear it... but rather like the way you see Lokmanya Tilak wearing it in your history books!) . Traditional usually has a historical flavour to it, while ethnic could easily be contemporary!  I think I'm going into too many inconsequential details and this is taking the shape of a rambling rant!!... so I gather myself before I digress into oblivion and continue!...  Every year, we have a  sri satyanarayan mahapooja  in our office on the eve of Dussehra and there is a very festive atmosphere in the office on this day  (i.e. today!) . Boxes of sweets are also distributed to everybody and that makes it a doubly sweet occasion! ;-)  So, today was something to be looked forward to, inspite of being a Monday!   By the way... today is also  urlLink Suku 's birthday!! So, many happy returns of the day to her! :-)  Tomorrow, I take the first step towards addressing that list of items I want, that I published a few blogs ago! I will in all probability go and buy a new cell-phone for myself!... As of now, my choice has been narrowed down to Nokia 5210 and Nokia 6510. If I go by the features alone, 6510 wins hands down. But if looks are considered, 5210 scores over 6510. So, its gonna be a tough choice to make at the cell-phone shop tomorrow!  *LOL*   Couple of days to go for my sister's birthday as well  (its on the 16th) ... so I'll be buying something for her too! ... I still haven't made up my mind on that! ... any suggestions?! ;-)  Among other things, this weekend was a roller-coaster ride for Indian sports. The cricket team won the match against West Indies quite comfortably. But the hockey team lost to South Korea in the finals of the Asian Games. On the other hand the Indian athletics contingent proved to be a major surprise at the Busan Asian when they unexpectedly boosted the medals tally which looked quite impoverished due to the lack of medals in disciplines like shooting, boxing, weight-lifting, etc. But at the same time, an Indian runner who won a gold in the 1500 metres, Sunita Rani, was reported to have tested positive for a banned drug called Nandrolone. So, that sours the sweet taste of victory, just a little bit!  Anyways... I guess thats it for now!!...  Happy Dussehra to all of you!!  cheers!

       The case of a missing ogre and a visit to a beach  Busy days are here again!! As usual, I was the  early bird  today. Reached the office at 8:15 AM. And I have been  busy as a bee  right throughout the day. Though, i did manage to find some time for a few well-deserved breaks. And since my boss is going on a two-week holiday  (she'll be travelling to Sikkim!!) , she's ensured that we remain muchly occupied right through this two-week interlude that we hoped would be peaceful! ;-)  Well... enough of this birds and bees talk!! ... I guess you already know enuf abt birds and bees! ;-)  A couple of days ago, I surfed my way to  urlLink www.fabmart.com  and bought two items online. The first thing I selected was the VCD of  Shrek  and the second thing was a paperback edition of  Lord of the Rings . Yesterday, the delivery from Fabmart arrived with only one of the two items... only with the  LOTR  book. About the Shrek VCD they said  "We are having some difficulty in sourcing these items. We are attempting to procure the same from our sourcing partners in different locations. If we are unable to source these items within a week, we will cancel these items and initiate a refund to you for the same."   Darn!!!... what's with Shrek!!!?? I've searched for it in three Planet M stores, at two other shops selling VCDs... and now even at Fabmart!... It is not available anywhere!! The green ogre has vanished completely... in thin air!!   urlLink Suku ... does your offer of lending me the VCD still stand??! ;-)  Anyways... right now... I'm publishing one of the few travelogues I have attempted to write. Its about a visit to Dapoli/Murud beach in Konkan... a place that I visited with my friends in the office a few months back. It was an amazing experience... and as I just went through the travelogue one more time... I was tempted to put it up on the blog!! ... Check it out...   When someone suggested that we go to Dapoli instead of the much-debated options of Ganpatipule and Kihim beach, everybody was taken by surprise. Not many knew anything much about Dapoli. In fact most hadn't heard about the place at all. But then Dapoli, a small Konkan town situated about 700 to 800 feet above the sea level and yet so close to the coastline is considered to be the only hill station in the Konkan belt. And the salubrious climate prevalent here prompted the Britishers to set up a cantonment at this place, which is also referred to as the 'Mahabaleshwar' of Konkan. About 10 kms from Dapoli and on the Konkan coastline lies the small village of Murud. This isn't the Murud of the Murud-Janjira fort fame. Murud-Janjira too has an excellent beach and of course the famous fort. It is about 165 Kms from Mumbai. The Murud that we were planning to go is a small coastal village about 265 Kms from Mumbai. It is so small that had it not been for the heavenly beach present there, it would not have even figured on any of the national or state maps.  So, Dapoli it was! Upen took care of the accommodation right away, at the Murud , situated about 8 kms from Dapoli, on the coastline. Prajwal got us the best travel deal which we closed the following day. Meanwhile it was raining mails... mails to decide the games that we would play, mails to decide the itinerary, mails for this and mails for that. The wheels were set in motion and our minds rusted by city life were slowly beginning to open up to the idea of a fun filled weekend on the beach..  Finally the day of the trip dawned. Well, technically it didn't, because we beat the sun to it and set off in the predawn darkness towards Dapoli. As the towns started decreasing in size and the size between them started increasing, a wide array of foodstuff was introduced and consumed in double quick time. People say that if you have good company then the longest of routes seems like a walk in the park. This most certainly was evident as the minibus sped past tiny hamlets with cute little houses (a distinctive feature if you travel by road in the Konkan region). We passed acres and acres of paddy fields separated by swaying palm trees. The lone track of Konkan Railway kept us company for the better part of the journey. And in no time at all, we entered the small town of Dapoli, where we had lunch. Immediately after the lunch, we set off towards our destination, Murud Beach Resort.  Just a half an hour later we found ourselves walking through palm and supari (betel nut) plantations on the way the resort. Then suddenly, without warning, there lay the Arabian Sea directly in front of us. We had arrived at the Resort. With surprising alacrity, defying the seven hour long journey, we unloaded the luggage from the bus and set up our base stations in the cute little thatched huts of the resort. And in no time at all, we were running onto the beach, heeding the call of the sea. As the group frolicked in the water, I went on a photo-clicking spree. I clicked the beach, I clicked the gently swaying palms, I clicked the resort. I even clicked some crabs on the beach (but I spent the better part of 15 minutes trying to get a crab to pose for me!).  As the evening progressed and the sun set, we sat down on the soft, white sand and listened to the incessant roar of the waves. The twilight gave way to darkness and the sky pulled on a blanket studded with a billion brilliant diamonds. The pitch-black sky looked resplendent with the tiny pinpricks of brilliance that were the stars. Each an individual and at the same time part of a formation. One was blue another green and yet another was sparkling red. We didn't think anything could beat this scene. We were wrong though. Rochelle spotted a tiny speck of light zooming across the sky. It was a shooting star! I am sure everyone sitting there marvelling at this feat of nature wished for something or the other. Well, at least I did! It was as if a touch of magic was added to an already bewitched atmosphere.  When the dinner bell was sounded, none of us wanted to get up and let go of these enchanted moments. The dinner, though, was another treat. Fried Bangda (Mackerel) and prawn curry (both fresh from the sea) were amazing and had us saying, 'Yeh dil maange more!' Post dinner, we set up a campfire on the beach and sat around it telling horror tales and frightening the wits out of each other. It must have been an eerie sight too! Imagine a pitch-black sky, a beach about four-five miles long (all to ourselves), not a sound except the steady roar of the waves, the metronomic sweep of the beacon from a distant lighthouse... and a group of people sitting hunched around a crackling fire singing haunting melodies from Hindi horror classics. Makes your hair stand on its end, doesn't it?!  Morning dawned and brought with it a biting chill. I, alongwith another guy from the group, grabbed our cameras and set off for a walk on the beach to snap up a couple of shots of the beautiful beach at the start of the day. The beach looked absolutely flat and untouched. It was as if we hadn't set foot there the earlier day, leave aside the rowdy football games that we had played the evening before. The high tide in the night, like a caring mom, had tidied up the mess we had created in the sand. Even the remnants of the campfire had been covered under a thick layer of sand. The waves had left a sine wave pattern all along the length of the beach. A cold cross breeze was making my teeth chatter. The waves on one side, the palm tree plantations on the other and the flat beach with the wavy pattern. It looked straight out of a landscape painter's dream. I clicked away to glory. We captured the serenity of the surroundings in our cameras, while the sun rose to herald a brand new day.  Then in a few minutes we were back to where we belonged... in the water! All the guys dove into the water with bare torsos and had an absolute blast, crashing headlong into the waves and in general, having a whale of a time. Hours turned into minutes and quietly sped past and then it suddenly struck us that we had to leave soon.  After a final set of group snaps, we bade adieu to the wonderful resort where we spent just about a day (but a wonderful, wonderful day), and set off towards Dapoli, where we once again had lunch.  Then it was back to the minibus, which trundled along on the route towards Mumbai. There was surprisingly little traffic on the highway for a Sunday evening and in no time Mumbai had arrived. It was time for another set of farewells and handshakes. As I got off the bus, I suddenly realised that this was the end of the journey (almost sounds foolish, but cant seem to put it in better words!).  During the ride back to home in a cab, I couldn't help but think what a wonderful time I had with an absolute wonderful bunch of people. And in the end all I can say for those who didn't come, is that 'Forgive them God, for they know not what they missed!!'  An advice for the people wanting to visit Mauritius or Seychelles... You should consider visiting places like Dapoli/Murud (and countless others) which are in our own backyard!!  If you have reached here after reading through the entire travelogue, I salute your patience!!. If you have come here directly, please go back where you left off and read the entire thing, so that you can earn your salute!! :-))  cheers! ... have a fab weekend!

       An ode to Maharashtrian girls!  Came across this today while browsing through my bloated inbox, trying to delete some mails!!  Read... Sing... Enjoy!!!   Delhi girls are cultured, they'll show you a good time Malayali girls seems so innocent, but ya know what's on their mind Andhra girls are bashful, Bengalis are so cosy Kashmiri girls keep you warm at night with their cheeks so rosy  Punjabi girls are flirts, Oriya girls are charming And Tamil girls squeeze you so tight, they really are alarming But there's one place in this whole land where I'm never lonely 'Cause the cuttest girls in all the world are in Maharashtra only  I wish they all could be Maharashtra girls ! I wish they all could be Maharashtra girls !   *LMAO*  cheers!

       On a day like this!  Nothing has been right today! Its just one of those days!!  I woke up in the morning, only to discover that my dormant tooth-ache had decided to make its presence felt. The ache  (ache is probably too mild a word for what I was experiencing this morning!)  was causing the entire right-hand side of my face to throb rythmically with an occasional stab of lightning shooting out from my lower jaw running all the way up to my temple!  With gritted teeth, I bore all that pain till it took mercy on me and subsided. I resolved to visit the dentist as soon as possible. But since Diwali is just round the corner, I felt I should be able to eat all the Diwali goodies. So, I decided that I should schedule my visit the the dentist only after Diwali was over.  (I know that my decision was foolish... but inertia and lethargy scored over reason!)   Cut to the office... where, all of a sudden, a bad case of headache hit me! It was as if ten heavy metal bands were simultaneously playing some rip-roaring music right inside my head. And I'm not exaggerating!!  Very soon, I had burning eyes, itchy throat and heavy eyelids. I was also feeling slightly chilly. I detect the onset of a fever. Lets hope it stays away!!  Just then... the fluorescent tube situated right above my cubicle flickered for some time and then literally in a puff of smoke, blew out!! The acrid odour of an electrical fire hung heavy in the air as the smoke from the burnt out fuse drifted stealthily, clinging to the ceiling. To make matters worse, the smoke detector failed to detect the smoke that brazenly drifted past it!!  After lunch, I did not go for the customary  after-lunch  walk since it was too sunny. Instead I decided to pass some time by making some enhancements to this page. So, I registered for a free page-hit counter service and put up their code on this page. But as luck would have it... the page-hit counter refuses to work!! You can see for yourself that it shows 000000 even though I know for a fact that this page has been viewed number of times since that code was put up!  Today,  urlLink Onkar  wrote, on his blog, about an article which highlighted the sorry fact that our elected representatives do not know much about the national anthem. I commented on his blog by saying that it was disgusting to see our politicians so ignorant about our national anthem. All very acceptable... you might think! But somehow I mentioned that  Vande Mataram  was our national anthem. When  urlLink Sat  rightly pointed out my blunder, I felt absolutely embarassed!!... complete with blushing and the works!! I can't, for the life of me, imagine what possessed me to make such an elementary mistake!! I just wanted to bury my head in the ground like those ostriches!! ... In  Bambaiyya  lingo...  ekdum popat ho gaya!!  Onkar even pronounced a punishment for me to help atone my sins!!... He says, and I quote...  "haha...go write janaganamana is the national anthem 10 times..while you are standing on one leg, holding the chalk in your mouth!"   I guess I'll do just that!! :-)  So you see!!... its been one of those days!!... everything I touched, turned to stone! ... somewhat of a reverse-Midas touch!... In case you happen to bump into me today, run away as fast as possible!! ;-)  I just hope that today ends quickly as possible and that I don't carry today's luck into tomorrow!!  Cheers!

       The Perfume  This is one of the many  inspirational  stories that we all get from someone or the other via email. It stood out among the many recent ones that I received. So, I'm putting it up here.   As she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of  school, she told the children an untruth. Like most teachers, she looked at her students and said that she loved them all the same. But that was impossible, because there in the front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard.  Mrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he didn't play well with the other children, that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a bath. And Teddy could be unpleasant.  It got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight marking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X's and then putting a big "F" at the top of his papers. At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review each child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last. However, when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise.  Teddy's first grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh.  He does his work neatly and has good manners... he is a joy to be around."   His second grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is an excellent student, well liked by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle."  His third grade teacher wrote, "His mother's death has been hard on him. He tries to do his best, but his father doesn't show much interest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren't taken."  Teddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is withdrawn and doesn't show much interest in school. He doesn't have many friends and he sometimes sleeps in class."  By now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents , wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for Teddy's. His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper that he got from a grocery bag. Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing, and a bottle that was one-quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was, putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist.  Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long to say, "Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to."  After the children left she cried for at least an hour.  On that very day, she quit teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic. Instead, she began to teach children. Mrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Tedd! y. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and, despite her lie that she would love all the children the same, Teddy became one of her "teacher's pets."  A year later, she found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life.  Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then wrote that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life.  Four years after that, she got another letter, saying that while things had been tough at times, he'd stayed in school, had stuck with it, and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. He assured Mrs. Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he'd ever had in his whole life.  Then four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he explained that after he got his bachelor's degree, he decided to go a little further. The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little longer.... the letter was signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD.  The story doesn't end there. You see, there was yet another letter that spring. Teddy said he'd met this girl and was going to be married. He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit at the wedding in the place that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom.  Of course, Mrs. Thompson did. And guess what? She wore that bracelet, the one with several rhinestones missing. And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together. They hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson's ear, "Thank you Mrs. Thompson for believing in me. Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference".  Mrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back. She said, "Teddy, you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference. I didn't know how to teach until I met you."

Read on...   ROWAN TREE (Sensitivity)  - full of charm, cheerful, gifted without egoism, likes to draw attention, loves life, motion, unrest, and even complications, is both dependent and independent, good taste, artistic, passionate, emotional, good company, does not forgive.

       The disappearing page trick!  I just tried to access this page i.e.  urlLink http://supersam5.blogspot.com  and voila!... an arabic page loaded up!! This particular page was a BlogSpot page... with a blog written in Arabic!!   I was like... " What the heck!?!! "... someone has taken over my page!!... and with all the things happening in the world... it was hard not to be slightly paranoid!! ;)  But then I thought... " Why am I being paranoid?!! "... why would terrorists hijack my page!?. So... I reloaded/refreshed the page.  And still the arabic page loaded up instead of mine. In desperation... I hit the Refresh button on the browser a few more times... but to no avail!! The lifelog of some Arabian fellow confronted me instead of the usual rants of this Indian! The inability to decipher even an iota of the curly script visible on the screen compounded my vexation. And I did not know what to do!  So... I took a coffee break... and downed a cup of an especially strong and bitter brew. Coming back to my cubicle, I shut off Internet Explorer and restarted it. I tried to load my page... again! Lo and behold!... the familiar black layout loaded up and there it was... my page in all its glory!!  *LOL*... I really dunno what had happened! Must've been some glitch... somewhere!... I'm glad that its been resolved now!...  Aren't you too?! ;)  cheers!

       Weekend report and a riddle...  This weekend was one of those weekends which passed off quickly even though I was not very busy. Its just that time passed very fast. Before I knew it, I was facing the dreadful prospect of dragging myself out of the bed on a monday morning with absolutely nothing exciting to look forward to. But there were documents to be read and codes to be written... so I got up and came to the office.  Saturday was a great day. One of my best friends from college, Roopmay  (yeah.. thats a Bong name!) , was coming down from Pune to catch the flight to Toronto. I had insisted that he come to my place than put up in a dreary guest-house. He was supposed to arrive at my place by around 6:30 to 7:00 PM. But somehow due to traffic on the way, he reached at 8 o'clock. It was great to see him after just over a year. We were soon lost in the nostalgic world of our college days... aahhh! ... those were the days! ... *sighs*   We were actually gibbering like girls  (ladies... please excuse!) ... when my mom announced that it was dinner-time! Dinner gave some respite for our larynxes as we resumed chatting immediately after having the meal. And in almost no time, it was time for him to leave. I accompanied him to airport and bid goodbye.  It was really great meeting and talking with Roopmay after such a long time and for a few hours I felt as if I was back in my college days! :-) ... We had some great times then... and perhaps sometime I will blog about some of the craziest things I did in college! ...  *LOL*   The first half of Sunday passed off quite peacefully. I just lay back and watched India thrash West Indies in the second Test Match at Chennai. The afternoon was earmarked for the commencement of Diwali shopping. I was in no mood to go out shopping. But mom and sister managed to persuade me and so I had to go! I bought mom a saree... which my mom took an eternity to select! ... ugghh! ... I got bored in the saree shop. I can only pray that my better half  (this is future tense)  can select sarees faster than this or better still, likes to wear something else that is easier to select while buying!! ;-)  After the marathon session at  Nalli's   (the saree shop) ... we went to  Westside  where I selected a couple of tee-shirts in double quick time! Since I wasn't mentally ready to do shopping, I refused to consider buying trousers. Maybe sometime next week!... I really cannot plan when I'm gonna do the shopping... It just happens!  (though I'm not an impulse buyer!) .  Enough about shopping now... it makes this blog a bit  girly ... :-\  I'm an  X-phile . For those who don't know...  X-philes  are people who love X-Files! Like Mulder... I belive that  the truth is out there  and for a long time I used to think that Gillian Anderson was the cutest thing on earth! And I'm loving the episodes that are currently being aired on Star World. The suspense is nicely being kept up week after week!  Anyways... coming back to today... it was a horrible day today. The hectic schedule that kept me on the toes till friday last week has slackened a bit and I had to go back to reading awfully boring documents while barely managing to keep my eyelids open! I hope its better tomorrow!  Okay ppl... here's a riddle to end today's blog... try it!    This thing all things devours; Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays kings, ruins town; And beats high mountains down.    What am I talking about?!! ... This isn't an original riddle, though! People who've read a certain book would know the answer immediately  (or so I think!)  ;)  ok... I'm outta here!  cheers!

       Some interesting pieces of information!  Now, why would the news of two scientists shaking hands make it to the headlines of a national newspaper?!! Ordinarily, it wouldn't much of a news. But this is not ordinary. These scientists shook hands with each other even though they were located 3000 miles apart!! Whoa!... long hands!!!... you might exclaim! But this was not a news to announce a medical breakthrough in lengthening limbs. Instead it was a news item announcing that these scientists were able to actually shake hands over the internet. Sounds incredible, doesn't it?!! Its true! These people used the high bandwidth fibre-optic cables to send across small impulses at very high frequencies. These impulses re-created the sense of touch. You can read more about this breakthrough  urlLink here . So now... if you are chatting with someone on the Net and get an urge to get touchy-feely... you know what to do! ;)  One commodity that's quite abundant in the world is stupidity and daily we hear about someone or something that just adds to this ever-growing reservoir of stupidity. Take the case of  urlLink this  jobless burglar who stole about 10,000 Swiss Francs worth equipment and fled. His only mistake in this whole affair was that he left his CV behind at the scene of crime!! ... complete with name and address!! How much more can you expect a person to be!! :-|  You must've heard about the funniest joke in the world... the one about the hunters who went to the woods for hunting. This was selected as the best and the funniest joke from among a collection of 40,000 jokes collected from all over the world. The study was carried out by the  urlLink Laughlab  created by Dr. Richard Wiseman (University of Hertfordshire) in association with the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Well, anyways... here is the joke that lost out to the first placed joke in the final round... Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson go on a camping trip.  After a good dinner and a bottle of wine, they retire for the night, and go to sleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes up and nudges his faithful friend. "Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see." "I see millions and millions of stars, Holmes" replies Watson. "And what do you deduce from that?" Watson ponders for a minute. "Well, astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets.  Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo.  Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful, and that we are a small and insignificant part of the universe. What does it tell you, Holmes?" Holmes is silent for a moment.  "Watson, you idiot!" he says.  "Someone has stolen our tent!"  Well, here's something interesting! ... My friend  Rochelle  thinks I resemble a cat!! Now, when I asked her the reason for that she said it was because I appeared to be comfortable! ... or basically very untroubled at all times! ... *LOL* ... I told her she looks like a deer! ;-)  One of my friends sent me the following in a mail today. Its a repeat, but a good read anyways!...  (some knowledge of the programming language 'C' would help... but its not a must... you would understand it easily!) ...  struct female_professionals { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double styles; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short skirts; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long time_to_understand_problems; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float mind; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void knowledge; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char non_co-operative; };  struct married_females { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double weight; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short tempered; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long gossip; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float hopes; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void word; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char unstable; };  struct engaged_females { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double time_on_phone; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short attention_on_work; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long boast; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float on_cloud_nine; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void understanding; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char edgy; };  struct newly_married_females { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double dinner_invitation; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short time_at_work; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long lunch_break; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void bank_balance; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char hen_pecked; };  struct husband_wife_professionals { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double income; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short tempered; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long time_no_see_each_other; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void love_life; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char money_making; };  struct beautiful_city_girl { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double boyfriends; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short affairs; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long stories; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void greymatter; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char flirt; };  struct old_lady { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double chin ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short memory; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long sighs ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void attention_from_men; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char chatterbox; };  *LOL*... females explained!!  Anyways... today is a rare blip on my social-radar! My friend is treating me and a few other friends to dinner. Its been a long time since I ate out... bcos the past couple of months have seen me working from 8 to 8 in the office! So... its a welcome change! :)  Ok... with this I take your leave for the moment!  cheers!

       Mental inside!  I had an interesting day yesterday. Well...  (getting defensive)  it wasn't all that interesting. But its my life that we're talking about here! Anything remotely out of the ordinary can be construed as  interesting .   urlLink Intel  has a forum for software developers known as the  urlLink Intel Developer's Forum  and they have these frequent conferences all over the world. This year, the Indian leg of these conferences was held at Mumbai. And, last week on Friday, my boss asked me to go and attend it. Fine, I said... after all its not everyday that I get a chance to go to such conferences where latest technologies and software techniques are showcased. As it happened I was the only person from our Mumbai office to attend the conference. The other four people from the company were from the Pune office. So, they took care of the registration and other formalities...  (which means that they arranged for a free-pass for me!) .  So, yesterday... dressed in formal clothes, I set off towards the venue which incidentally was  The Taj Lands End  at Bandra... the hotel formerly known as The Regent...  (Prince has started a bad trend!) . I waited at the bus-stop for a bus which could take me to my destination. But as it always happens with me... all kinds of buses came and went... but the one I required  (no. 86)  refused to turn up! Glancing at my watch, I saw that I was going to be late. So, I jumped into a cab and asked the driver to hurry along since I did not want to be late. The maniac behind the wheel needed no further prompting as tried to do a Michael Schumacher! I sat in the back seat with one hand clutching the seat and the other hand clutching the cell-phone... my eyes wide open in terror, as the cab whizzed through the morning traffic without any regard to human life or property! Almost in no time... I was at Bandstand standing outside the imposing hulk of The Taj Lands End.  Here... I waited because I did not have the pass which could let me through to the ballroom where the conference was to be held. Actually, I was one of the first few to turn up at the venue. I was told that since I did not have the pass, I could wait for my colleagues, who had my pass, to arrive from Pune... or I could pay up a thousand bucks and eneter the ballroom then and there. Being the freeloader that I am, I waited. The bus from Pune was supposed to arrive at around 9:00 AM. So, all I could do was the loiter around in the lobby... which wasn't such a good option since the AC was at full blast and my teeth were actually beginning to chatter  (this is normally not a cause for concern... but nowadays, these teeth have given me sleepless night... literally!!... so I had to be careful) . The other option was to stand outside the main door... basking in the pleasantly warm morning sun. But even that option was spoiled by the large number smokers who were puffing away to glory... polluting the fresh air that was brought in by the cool sea breeze. So... I chose a chair in an obscure corner of the lobby which the central airconditioning had been kind enough to exempt from the stream of cold air it continuously spewed out. There I was... sitting in the corner... twiddling my thumbs... watching the stream of CEOs, CIOs, CTO, CFOs of various companies get off their chariots and dwaddle into the ballroom while barking orders into the hands-free kits of their mobile-phones. Occaisonally... a good looking face would breeze through the door like a whiff of fresh air! :-)  As the clock ticked by minutes turned to hour and there was still no sign of the bus from Pune. So I waited some more! Finally... at 11 o'clock... well after the Intel CTO had delivered his keynote speech  (without me in the audience, of course!)  the bus from Pune turned up. As the weary Puneites filed out of the bus, I desperately tried to locate my Pune colleagues. But... I could not find them. My spirits took a nose-dive as I turned to leave. But then, a pretty assistant saw my plight and informed me that there were supposed to be three buses scheduled to arrive from Pune. Once again, my hopes soared as I continued to wait for those elusive colleagues. Then at 11:30 AM... the remaining two buses arrived and with them... my free pass!! ;-)  After I handed over my pass... I was given a bag which contained a variety of brochures from Intel and the sponsors like Microsoft and TCS. The bag also contained an Intel T-shirt, a pen with a string to put it around the neck, a writing pad, etc. With this bag of goodies (??!), I made my way into the ballroom which was already full while the CTO of TCS was in the midst of an inspired  (and perhap... for some.. inspiring!)  speech. The next speech was by a Maharashtrian guy, Abhijit Talwalkar, who is a VP in Intel. This guy had a stronger American accent than even the couple of other American speakers who addressed the conference!!  Well, after this speech... we were treated to sumptuous lunch followed by some lip-smacking desserts. After lunch I roamed about in the lobby visiting the various stall put up by companies like Intel, Microsoft, TCS, RedHat, etc. At each stall... I collected some freebie or the other and at the end of my visit to the stalls... I had both my hand full of brochures, and goodies like... mouse pads, pens, badges, promotional offers... and even a stopwatch-cum-FM-radio!! ;-) ... as I said... I'm quite a freeloader!  The presentation sessions after lunch were boring... much like this blog which is now threatening to grow out of proportion  (it has already gone past the limits of dullness) . Anyways... so the point is that the afternoon session was so boring that I fell asleep right under the nose of a video camera which was capturing the action  (I guess my sleepy head, on camera, nodding slowly in my sleep would be a better feedback than the lengthy form that they made us fill out!) . Finally... at 5:00 PM... after a barrage of presentations and a comparatively productive session in one of the Technology Labs, I decided to return home!  Back home... I found my mom making  chivda  for Diwali. So, I helped her prepare the chivda with an ulterior motive of popping some in the mouth as it was being made!! In fact, I ate so much of it that I did not have any dinner yesterday evening! *LOL*  With some time on my hands and I decided to watch Shrek, since I had not been able to do so even though I had bought the VCD last weekend. Shrek came heavily recommended and I was afraid that it might not live upto the hype as is the case with so many movies I have been recommended. But no sirree, Bob!!... it was an amazing movie with a simple storyline and I had a smile on my lips from start to the end  (something that no movie has managed to do in the recent past!) . In short... it lived upto its rating and recommendations!... and how!!  Now then... if I continue rambling like this... I'm sure to lose readership... which is something that would never do!! So... I take your leave for the day!!  cheers!

In fact, I just got a mail with an attachment which had a Flash animation with this song being sung by a Smiley.    Here is a little song I wrote You might want to sing it note for note Don't worry be happy In every life we have some trouble When you worry you make it double Don't worry, be happy......   Ain't got no place to lay your head Somebody came and took your bed Don't worry, be happy The land lord say your rent is late He may have to litigate Don't worry, be happy Lood at me I am happy Don't worry, be happy Here I give you my phone number When you worry call me I make you happy Don't worry, be happy Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style Ain't got not girl to make you smile But don't worry be happy Cause when you worry Your face will frown And that will bring everybody down So don't worry, be happy (now).....    Great song by Bobby McFerrin and great performance by Robin Williams in the video!!  cheers!

       Shrek-mania  I seriously think that there is someone out there playing games with me. Out there, meaning really  out there ... *points to the sky*... !!! And they've chosen something as innocent as an animated movie called  Shrek  as the plaything!!  Consider this... Over the last month, I've searched high and low for a VCD of Shrek. As I've already mentioned in some of my previous blogs, I could not find a copy of Shrek in any of the stores that I visited. This includes the high-profile Planet M stores, a couple of video-shops near my home, a couple more not-so-near my home and even online at  urlLink Fabmart . At all these places I was, very courteously, told that no copies of the said VCD were in stock. I dunno why, but everytime I got a negative response at any shop, I became more obsessed with trying to hunt down a VCD for myself.  urlLink Suku  even offered to lend me her copy. That was extremely sweet of her!! Thanks a bunch for that offer, Suku!! :) Okay... so the bottomline is that I was getting desperate  (yeah! I know it sounds foolish!... and IT IS!!!)   So, this weekend, when I had been to  Crossroads   (for those who don't know... it's a shopping mall in Mumbai... and not the Britney Spears movie!!) ... I just casually sauntered into  Groove , the music shop. And there it was!! Displayed in all its glory... the VCD of Shrek! My eyes lit up and I grabbed it... before someone whisked it away from right under my nose!!  After I came home, feeling pleased with myself for getting the sought-after disc, I logged on to the Net to check up my mails. And what should I find there?!!!... A mail reminder from Fabmart informing me with great joy that they were, at long last and after much efforts, able to procure the VCD for me and had promptly shipped it to me!!  Its true what they say in Hindi...  Bhagwan deta hai to chhappar phad ke deta hai . Translated, it means, when God gives he gives by tearing the roof. Ummm... I think I messed up the translation... but what the heck!... two days back I was  Shrek-less . Today, I'm  over-Shreked !!  I think I've shrieked enough about Shrek  Other news is that I have managed to make one more dent in my  Feed-the-Greed  list I had blogged about a couple of weeks earlier. As I have already mentioned, I had been to Crossroads on Saturday. The main motive behind going there was to buy myself a watch. So,  veni... vidi... compravo!!  (that... I think, means I came, I saw, I bought!... though don't quote me on that!!) ;)  I bought a  Swatch Irony ! Its a chronograph with a dial of polished steel and a strap of dull polished metal. It looks a bit flashy... but what the heck!! ;)  Well, due to the Diwali promotion offers, I got two  D'signer  brand watches for free!... alongwith the Swatch!!... so I got three watches at the price of one! ;)  All throughout the weekend I was either shopping or doing some Diwali cleaning at home. In the time I managed to squeeze in between these activities, I started reading  Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring . I'm just a 100 pages into the book and I'm already in love with it! The flowing narrative sucks you in and makes you a co-conspirator in the adventures of Frodo, Sam and company! Its wonderful... and I just can't wait to sink my fangs deeper into this amazing adventure!! ;)  Yesterday, I wanted to go and see  The Road to Perdition  with my friends. But as luck would have it, it was being screened only a three theatres in Mumbai and two of those were less-than-decent. And even the decent enough theatre was screening it at an inconvenient time. So, we had to drop that plan and instead we went and saw  xXx   (Triple X) !! I intend to write a full-length review for that movie... but in brief  (in brief... not in briefs!)  I can only say that if you want to go and see  xXx ... heed this advice... 1> Suspend your disbelief 2> Unscrew your head and keep it in your lap 3> Stock up the pop-corn and cola 4> Enjoy the action!!  Okay folks... I guess before I ramble any further... I'll take your leave for the moment. But before I leave... here's a verse from LOTR-FOTR that I liked...    The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can, Pursuing it with weary feet, Until it joins some larger way, Where many paths and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say.    cheers!   P.S. : Tomorrow... I would be spending the day at The Taj Lands End (formerly The Regent), as I would be attending the Intel Developer Forum conference there. The keynote speakers for the event would include the CTO of Intel. So, I've got to be on my best behaviour with formal clothes and sober demeanour... especially since I would be representing my organization! ...*LOL* ... such responsibility!! ;)

       The Big Day... the inside scoop!  Ok... so here it is!! ... the story of the evening of  8th November 2002 ...  The time we decided to meet at her place was  8:00 PM . So, taking into consideration the traffic  (very very important, bcos I did not want a repeat of last Saturday!) , I set off from the office at  6:00 PM   (amidst surprised looks and calls of "Half-day??" from my colleagues who are accustomed to see me leave the office at around  8:30  or  9:00 PM , everyday) . I catch the first bus that comes along and get off at Saki Naka to catch the bus which goes directly to my destination. I wait... but the bus does not come. I leave two buses that go to where I want to go, but take a circuitous route in getting there. But the bus I want is nowhere to be seen. Finally, after a wait of over 40 mins I get into the next bus that I see, hoping just to get away from the confounded place. Wrong bus, it turns out to be... it takes a looong route to just reach Andheri station. I can do nothing but twiddle my thumbs and look in frustration at my watch.  7:15 PM ... and still in Andheri!! I panic... scared at the thought of missing yet another appointment, get out of the bus and wait for another one. At long last... one bus that goes somewhere close to where I intend to, comes along and I hop into it. 10 minutes into the journey, I realize that once again it is a wrong choice of bus as even this takes the longer route. But I decide to stick with it. At  7:45 PM , I'm still at Santacruz... still a long way away from Prabhadevi! I call up and inform that I might be 10 mins late. She is understanding... she says that its okay coz she knows that traffic can be a bitch! I relax a bit and hope for the best. At  8:05 PM , I'm at Shivaji Park wher I jump off the bus and into a cab for the final leg of the journey. My mind is in a whirl and it is just my luck to get a chatty cabbie. He is an elderly Muslim gentleman who talks to me about how difficult it is to drive after fasting the whole day. He adds that his cab has gone for re-registration at the RTO and he's been given a new car to drive, which has floor gears... something he isn't accustomed to. I listen patiently... my mind just a couple of miles away!  Finally... at  8:10 PM ... the cab pulls to the side of the road. I have arrived!!... I pay up and don't wait for the change. I'm running the last few yards, glancing at the watch. Then... I find myself at her doorstep!...  I knock and push open the door. There she is!! ... waiting for me!! ... I smile at her and say  "I'm so sorry I'm late!!" .  Dr. Sonali Rangnekar, B.D.S. (Mumbai),... my dentist, beckons me to lie back on the chair and asks me,  "What seems to be the problem with your tooth, Sameer?"    Hmmm... people say its November. But I dunno why it suddenly feels like the April today!!!?...  wot say, ppl!!?  ;)  Thanks for all the comments though!! ... It was sweet of you to send me all those wishes!!... They helped too!! ... I didn't feel any pain at all!! ;)  Thats about it for now...details about my dental treatment later! *ROTFL* ;)  cheers!!

       Finally taking the big plunge!  Its today!! ... Today is the big day!  I'm going to take that big step today. I've been trying to put it off... trying to delay the inevitable. But yesterday evening, I finally gathered enough courage and made a call and asked her when she would be free today evening, and decided to meet her at 8:00 PM today!  I'm feeling jittery all day and as the time approaches, I'm beginning to feel some butterflies fluttering about in my tummy! God! ... I thought I could keep my emotions in check! ... How wrong I was!!!  All those who know Sonali (that's her name!) have told me that she's good!  I know that if I don't take the plunge now, I'll regret it and it'll hurt. I just hope that I am doing the right thing and not rushing into this. But who knows... by the end of this evening, spent with her, I may have left a part of me with her.  So... wish me luck ppl!!! ... I promise to tell you all how it goes today evening!! :-)  cheers!

       A little bit of  moi !!  I'll do an extra-narcissistic turn today and post something about myself. Nothing monumental or sentimental... just plain mental  (sic!)   At an undisclosed time on Tuesday, 5th October 1976, a stork visited the Gharat household and delivered a bundle of joy  (*LOL*) . Thus came into existence a homo sapiens sapiens, who would be officially named  Sameer  a few days later  (btw, I just remembered a F*R*I*E*N*D*S joke... Joey once says... "Ross, if homo sapiens actually were HOMO sapiens, is that why theyre exctinct?")   Okay... so back on track... The Gharats were obviously overjoyed to have a baby... but they noticed a peculiar thing about young Sameer. His ears were pierced... both of them... at exactly the same position! Weird, they thought!... and referred his case to the motley bunch of old 'n wise ladies who had come to his naming ceremony. Amazed, the old ladies scrutinized the the ears till young Sameer let out a sudden, loud wail and scared the wits out of the geriatric bunch who had huddled together over the cradle. The leader of the pack, Sameer's grandma, declared in a sapient tone that this was no ordinary child!! ... This was royalty... blue blood... a King from previous birth, who had re-incarnated!! As a hush descended over the room, Sameer, unaware of this startling revelation, frolicked merrily in his cradle... dribbling baby saliva and examining the innocuous, whirling toy that was hung directly above him. And as the gathered people regarded this  King  in their midst, with awed admiration, the  King  responded with a stream of  royal  piss and a cherubic smile to go with that!  Thats about all you'll get to know about the  King  today! For more... stay tuned on this blog as the life of Sameer unfolds... with a dash of  masala  thrown in for good measure! ;)  Anyways, back to more mundane things! ... Yesterday, being  Bhaubeej/Bhaiduj , I had been to one of my  mausi 's house where all my other uncles and aunts and cousins had gathered. It was great fun! ... The traditional  aarti  took place first. I received gifts and I gave away gifts... something that I love about this day! I gave my each of my sisters, a set of four conical hand-painted mugs, that I liked so much when I first saw them when I had visited  Westside  to do my Diwali shopping. :-)  After the  aarti , a general party mood took over and my mom and aunts settled down to discuss important things like their new sarees and the Diwali  faraaL  that they had made. The uncles and my dad settled down to the serious business of sipping on their drinks. :-)  The best part about yesterday evening was the food. The  veg pulao , the  chicken masala , the  prawn biryani , etc. tasted heavenly and I dug into it with gusto! ... my aching molars notwithstanding! ;)  After an eternity, my plate emptied and I could sense that there was not a fraction of a inch of space left in my tummy to eat anything more!... I had lived upto my reputation of being an incorrigible foodie! ... but!! ... I was sooo wrong!  There was more to come!... in the form of desserts! And, whatta dessert I had!!! ... Three monstrously huge  Gulab Jamuns , two huuuge hunks of sinful, creamy pastries... and double scoops of home-made  sitaphal  ice-cream!! By the time I popped the last  gulab jamun  in my mouth, I was done for!...  There's no way I'm going to be able to get up from this sofa , I thought, feeling heavier than a ton or two!!  But somehow I managed to drag myself into the car...drove back home and was asleep before I hit the bed!  Thanks to that heavy, but delicious dinner yesterday, I skipped breakfast today and had an extremely light lunch consisting of just a sandwich!  I guess that's all I have to say at the moment! But before I go... a couple of mentions.  urlLink Sindhu  has a cute new layout and she's moved from  urlLink Blogger  to  urlLink Greymatter .  urlLink Radhika  has blogged about the engagement of her sister and this account of the engament is absolutely wonderful and sounds like those elaborate weddings/engagements from Hindi movies, complete with song-and-dance routines! :-)  Well then... thats it for now! ... see you ppl later!  cheers!

       English!!     Where can a man buy a cap for his knee,  Or the key to a lock of his hair?  Can his eyes be called an academy  Because there are pupils there?   Is the crown of your head where jewels are found?  Who travels the bridge of your nose?  If you wanted to shingle the roof of your mouth,  Would you use the nails on your toes?   Can you sit in the shade of the palm of your hand,  Or beat on the drum of your ear?  Can the calf in your leg eat the corn off your toe?  Then why not grow corn on the ear?   Can the crook in your elbow be sent to jail?  If so, just what did he do?  How can you sharpen your shoulder blades?  I'll be darned if I know - do you?    cheers!

       ...kuch baksheesh milega?... *SLAP*!!  Today's  urlLink A.Word.A.Day  word from  urlLink Wordsmith  is  baksheesh . Quite a relevant word considering that during Diwali, we are subjected to an endless stream of people lining up outside the door asking for  baksheesh  or tip. These people include the postal workers  (postal workers are comprised of those who deliver ordinary post, registered post, speed post, telegrams, etc.) , the security guards, the liftmen, the gas-cylinder-delivery boys, MTNL linesmen, a  plethora of Municipal employees. and a whole lot of others. Every year, a new species makes its way to the door to claim their ' rightful '  baksheesh . Most of the people who come for this purpose are downright belligerent and rude and expect us to dole out money out of some sense of obligation.  One Tight Slap  is the only  baksheesh  that I feel obliged to hand out to such creeps!  Yesterday... while returning home from office, while sitting in the bus, I was suddenly and inexplicably struck by a bout of blues. Quite abruptly, a feeling of loneliness and melancholy swept over me. It was unexpected because I didn't remember anything during the day that could have been the cause of this feeling. The bus was full of people, with quite a few Diwali revellers returning home after spending time with their relatives. So, the mood in the bus was cheerful enough. Even the mood out on the streets was festive... with people... kids and adults... bursting crackers on the pavements and in the building compounds adjoining the road. The atmosphere was colourful with bright, colourful lights everywhere. But... all of a sudden, my mind switched off from this festive environs and dropped down in the dumps. I spent the remainder of the journey staring straight ahead... at nothing in particular... with a vortex of emotions churning in my head. I dunno what caused this strange mood... but everything seemed gloomy and meaningless all of a sudden. I almost missed my bus-stop because my mind was a million miles away! The walkman was playing Bryan Adams' ballads and the words from  Back to You  seemd to linger around in my mind...    i've been down - i've been beat i've been so tired - that i could not speak i've bin so lost that i could not see i wanted things that were out of reach     I made my way home in some sort of a daze. After reaching home... almost as abruptly my mood had gone down, it came back up once again!! No longer was I feeling depressed or sad. Just being among people whom I loved and who loved me seemd to revitalize me!! ... I know it sounds too phony to be true! ... but thats what happened!!   Anyways, today being  Bhaubeej  or  Bhaiduj , I'll be going to my aunt's house where all my cousins will be gathering for the traditional ceremony that involves the sisters performing  aarti  of the brothers. So, I'm leaving right now and hopefully would spend a nice evening!! :-)  cheers!

       Diwali days are here again!!  Hello everybody!... I'm back after a wee break!!...  (funny!... I was Sameer before I took the break... now I'm back!)   I'll give a brief account of the things I did during the Diwali break. So, here goes!...  On Friday I returned home from work and saw  urlLink The Sixth Sense  which was shown on Star Movies. Its such a great movie. A movie with a message, with a wrapping of a horror story around it. Only when you peel away the outer wrapping, will you realize that this movie goes beyond the genre of horror movies. It is not meant to be a pure horror flick, which is why you can spot holes spread right across the fabric of the plot. The movie makes a point about communication or the lack of the same. Everybody uses some means or the other to communicate in order to obtain knowledge or love or peace... be it humans or spirits... br it in this life or the next!  The next day, i.e. Saturday saw me doing some serious last minute Diwali cleaning at home. At the end of it, I was feeling a bit pooped. But had a couple of things to take care of at the office. So, I made my way to the office... with the only consolation being that I took the car instead of travelling in the bus or the train. In the evening, I was supposed to meet-up with  urlLink Shuchita  and  urlLink Suku . The meeting was scheduled at 6:30 PM and the first stop was Shuchita's place at Juhu. Now, Chandivali  (the sidey locality where my office is situated)  to Juhu makes for a travelling time of 20-30 minutes under normal traffic conditions. So, I left at 6:00 PM from the office, hoping to reach just in time. But the keyword was  normal traffic conditions ! And the traffic was anything but normal that day. As I sat behind the wheel in the car surrounded by zillion other cars, stuck in a vicious traffic snarl about halfway to the destination... I could only wait and watch... drumming my fingers, in frustration, on the steering wheel!! Finally, after an hour and a quarter of driving at a snail's pace, I managed to break free from the traffic and reached Juhu. A call to Shuchita later, I realized that the meet-up had been called off because there wasn't any news from me!! It was almost completely my fault since I failed to call up and tell that I was caught up in the jam. Poor old Suku had to come all the way to Juhu before she had to return because the meeting was cancelled! Hate me!... I deserve it! Shuchita, no doubt, would have got one more reason to brand all Sameers as jerks!  I was supposed to wake up early morning on Sunday and leave for Pune. Wake up I did! But after I did so, my mom informed me that the plans had changed and only my dad would make the trip to Pune. So, I went back to sleep!... got up late and did nothing for the better part of the day. Actually I watched the Indian cricket team stave off a possible defeat at the hands of West Indies. Sachin Tendulkar came back to form with a cracking 176. He was ably supported by Laxman who hit yet another ton at Eden Gardens, Kolkata! In the evening I went out and bought couple of boxes of sparklers or  phul-jharis ... only in the name of tradition, since I've stopped bursting crackers which emit more noise than light and/or colour.  Monday was the big day... the D-Day  (Diwali day) . Following the tradition, I got up early, much before dawn... at 4:00 AM, to be precise! My mom applied the paste of scented  uttna  on my arms, legs, face and back... some coconut milk or  shira  on my head... and I then took a bath... in the pre-dawn darkness. This bath... known as the  abhyanga-snana  is a Diwali tradition and I don't recall having missed this... ever! After the bath... I felt like a million bucks and smelt even better!!  *LOL*   After everybody was finished bathing, mom brought out the  faraaL  which is the best thing about Diwali!! I spent some quality time feasting on all the  chaklis ,  chivda ,  laddoos ,  karanjis ... till my stomach groaned and my tooth ached!! ;-) ... But it seemed criminal to refuse the delicacies that were laid out in front of us. As the stuff vanished from the plates in front ot us... our neighbour knocked on the door with a plateful of  faraaL  ...  (its a tradition to exchange faraaL) . So, no sooner did she leave than I turned my attention towards the newly arrived stuff! And... as if on cue... just as this plate was being emptied, my aunt arrived bringing with her another plateful of goodies to eat! ... *LOL*... it was too much of a good thing as I suddenly felt very sleepy... no doubt due to the fact that I had had a king-sized breakfast and also due to the fact that I had just 4 hours of sleep, the night before. So, with a contented tummy, I stretched out and slept. I didn't even wake up to have my lunch. I slept right throughout the day... waking up only in the late afternoon.  In the evening, I visited my uncle's place where I was subjected to another round of  faraaL !! And then to my friend's house where again I was offered a plateful of  chaklis ,  laddoos  and the like!! I had to politely refuse the offer... but only after having a bite as a token gesture! ... *LOL*  Diwali nights are the best!! Almost every house is decorated with lights and  kandeels ... and of course the wonderful little earthern  diyas . Majority of the homes have intricately designed  rangolis  outside their doors, which just adds to the whole atmosphere! Fewer sights can beat the sheer beauty of an exquisite, colourful  rangoli  flanked by rows of tiny  diyas . It is a sight both alive and serene at the same time... something that makes me wanna stop and admire!! :-)  Another feature of the nights during Diwali is... crackers! It just makes this festival so unique! This year though, there has been a marked decrease in the number of noisy crackers... which is a welcome change indeed! Instead, people have been buying rockets, and other aerial crackers which are a treat to the eyes. Hopefuly, this trend will continue and we will hopefully have a true festival of lights instead of the festival of noise that Diwali had degenerated into during these last few years!  Today morning, I woke up early... had a bath... dressed up in new clothes and visited the temple! Siddhivinayak temple, which is right next to our building was abuzz with people, in all their finery, coming to seek the blessings of  Ganapati  on the first day of the New year... i.e. Samvat 2059.  So...  Happy New Year to all of you!! ... may this new year bring prosperity and success in your lives!!  Today happens to be the birthday of my best buddy, Saurabh. I've known him for the last 13 years and he's been my best friend for all those years!! Many many happy returns of the day to him!!! ...  Happy Birthday Saurabh!!   By the way... I'm wearing my new watch for the first time today and unless I'm mistaken... I've been getting second looks!! ...  admiring  second looks... to be precise!! ;-)  *LOL   Hmmm... now that I look back... I realize that this wasn't such a brief account after all!! ... But what the heck!! ... its Diwali!!!! ... anything goes!! ;-)  cheers!!

       Corn Club!  Feel like having some corn flavoured humour??...  Well... I give you no choice! ... here some of the PJs  (groaners)  that my twisted mind has been able to conceive!...   Q . Why do the local trains in Mumbai give such a good performance?  Ans . With 9 coaches, you HAVE to perform well!!  another one... read this patiently... There is this man who has a brother. Now, this brother falls in love with a female and gets married even though there is a lot of opposition in the family to their marriage. Everyone disowns the brother... everyone except our man! It so happens that the brother's wife gives birth to a girl. Everyone is happy... even the family that had once disowned the brother. Our guy becomes the godfather of the little girl. Then years pass and the girl grows up to be a beautiful woman. And inevitably falls in love with a guy from her college. There is a sense of dja vu as the entire family goes against this match. Again, everyone except our guy disowns the girl. The family members constantly taunt and harass the girl on the subject of her affair with the guy from her college. The girl suffers all these taunts silently till one day she can't take it anymore. She attempts suicide by eating a lot of sleeping pills. Thankfully, our guy finds her fallen on the living room floor and rushes her to a nearby hospital. The doctors toil hard and bring the girl out of danger. They congratulate the guy on his promptness because otherwise it would have been too late. Now, the girl is resting on the hospital bed and our guy is outside the room, sitting on a bench looking awfully crestfallen. Just then he sees a world famous lead singer of a very famous group, passing by... a group that is one of the girl's favourite!... Our guy has an idea... he requests the the singer to go and meet the girl to cheer her up. After a little persuasion the singer agrees. He goes inside the room and after a few minutes, comes back. Then that world famous singer, tells the guy that the girl is okay and happy now. The singer also starts singing a song. Hearing the song, our guy nods and says "Yes!". ...Now...  I've told you all so much... you just have to tell me who is that singer and what song did he sing??  Ans . The singer was Mick Jagger ... and the song that he sang was... "Fallin' in love is so hard on your niece... "   *LOL* ... don't you just want to hit me!! ;)  Ok... here's another!... Once there were three good friends, Tom , Dick and Harry. They had a peculiar habit... that of going to a movie first day, first show every week. And they always without fail went to the movies together... all the three of them!  So, now what happens is that this week they decide to go and watch the hottest release of the week. But this time, there seems to be a weird problem. All the three can't go together. Only two of them can go to the movie. So, to decide who should go to the movie, they draw lots. It so happens that Tom and Harry are selected to go to the movie while Dick is left all alone. Tom and Harry go and watch the movie!... So, can you guess which movie it was???  Ans . The movie is 'Company'!! ... and the reason why just the two of them went to watch it is that everybody knows that... "Two's Company and three's a crowd!!!"  Q. Why won't a married guy use Colgate Fresh Energy Gel toothpaste?  Ans . Bcos once u use that toothpaste... har saas bole... talk to me!! ...  (saas : mother-in-law)  ;)  ... Ok Ok... last one for the moment!!...  Take care of ur hair 2de! ... wash 'em... oil 'em... comb 'em... perm 'em... colour 'em... in short... pamper 'em!!... why?.. you ask!!  Ans . 'coz 2de is Baal Din!!!  ;-p   HAPPY CHILDREN'S DAY TO YOU ALL  cheers!

I had invited you all to define happiness... and some of you did so in the comments box...  see below for the blog dated 10th November 2002 .... Now it is my turn!  According to me life is like a journey through a dark night. You can't see much further up the road, so you stumble along the path towards the final destination. Sometimes... along comes a firefly, flitting around you, glowing as it buzzes around you... a tiny speck of light in the pitch black expanse of the night! You reach out and clasp your palms gently around the firefly and bring your hands closer to your face... then slowly open the hands. The tiny glow of the firefly lights up your face!!   The firefly fleeting around you, is a moment of happiness! It is upto you to gently grasp it and enjoy the moment when it lights up your face. Then... the glow dies down and the world is pitch black again! You must continue your journey with the memories of the moments of happiness that touched your life.  A wise man knows that he should not stand on the path, hoping for the firefly to glow again or thinking too much about the beauty of the moment that passed. He knows that fireflies abound along the path of life. One has only to keep a lookout for them and when one is spotted... enjoy the moment and continue walking!   Happiness is a drink best enjoyed in small sips!!   Hee hee!! ... I hope that was not too philosophical!!! ;-)  So... don't worry... be happy!!  cheers!!

       LitKwiz  Reading is one thing I like the most. I can read anything and everything. There was a time when I used to eat books...  (now... due to limited time I've had to go on a diet, so to speak) . I've once attempted the near impossible task of reading three books in one night... and succeeded!!  (The three books I read in one night were the books in the Bourne trilogy by Robert Ludlum) . Such is my passion for reading. I'll list out a few of my favourite books some other time when I have the time and the inclination to do so.  Another of my most favourite activities is  Quizzing ... be it simple trivia, general knowledge, literature, music, sports... I like to create and solve quizzes on just about anything.  Today, I combine these two passions of mine and post a quiz based on literature. It consists of 10 questions. Each question contains the starting lines of some famous work of literature ... (some classic... some not so classic) . You have to identify the  name of the book  and the  name of the author  of that book.  The questions are simple... so take the quiz... and post your answers in the comments box. So here goes...  1." What can you say about a 25 year old girl who died?"  2. "Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife."  3. "The great fish moved silently through the night water, propelled by short sweeps of its crescent tail."  4. "The drought had lasted now for ten million years, and the reign of the terrible lizards had long since ended."  5. "Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court Number 3 and waited for justice; vengeance on the men who had so cruelly hurt his daughter, who had tried to dishonor her."  6. "Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loin."  7. "Call me Ishmael."  8. "All children, except one, grow up."  9. "Most motorcars are conglomerations (this is a long word for bundles) of steel and wire and rubber and plastic, and electricity and oil and gasoline and water, and the toffee papers you pushed down the crack in the back seat last Sunday."  10. "It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips."  See!! ... so simple!! ... Now go ahead and send me those answers! :-)  cheers!

       Happy days...  I have officially applied to get 9th November declared universally as the   All Fools' Day  . The reason is obvious!!... Isn't it?! ;-)  Okay... I've gloated enough on my handiwork! ...   Yesterday was one of the best days I've had in the recent past. Well, I've had some great days, but yesterday was somehow more satisfying than most of them.  Yesterday morning, I had my first session with the dentist.  (Its true that I first met the dentist on Friday, but that was just for examination of the tooth and the extent of damage to it!) . The doctor told me that according to her clinical diagnosis, the decay was extensive, but it had not yet reached the nerve. There seemed to be no apparent reason to do a Root Canal. She would give her final verdict only after the excavation was done.  So, yesterday morning, I made my way to the dentist and lay down on the chair. In few moments variety of objects simultaneously entered my mouth, the doctor's hands, the drill, the mirror and the suction pump  (don't pass any snide remarks about the size of my mouth, ok!)  Having heard some very chilling tales about the terrors of the drill, I was queasy when the whirring sound of the drill started and the dentist went to work on my grinder.  Strangely, I could feel no pain! After a couple of minutes the drill stopped and the dentist asked me if I felt any pain. As I said no, she nodded and went to work again... this time feeling a bit more adventurous! .. Still no pain!! I wondered if the drill was indeed touching my molar or was just making a big noise! Once more, the dentist raised her head and asked the same question. I replied in the negative. Surprise was very apparent on her large brown eyes which were the only visible features of her beautiful face that was framed by unruly shoulder-length hair hurriedly tucked behind the ears. She said,  "Still?!" , expecting me to answer... a difficult proposition indeed with a mouthful of instruments. I just shake my head like a child. The drilling begins once again! ... After a while the whirring stops once again. The digging is complete! The dentist looks at her handiwork and says,  "Baraach moTha khaDDaa aahe!" ... which when translated means something like...  "This is one big freaking cavity you've got here, mister!"   The dentist is amazed that I never felt any pain. She uses an instrument to tap my tooth.  "Owww!!" , I cry out,  "That hurt!" . Now she is satisfied. She tells me that the tooth is still alive and can be treated without a Root Canal. She also adds that I have a high threshold of pain. With that, she goes ahead and fills up the cave in my tooth with a temporary paste of clove-flavoured cement and tells me to come back in two weeks.  The moral of this story is that contrary to my fears, my tooth-ache did not warrant the dreaded procedure of Root Canal. I am happy!!  Cut to the office... I'm supposed to deliver a document on Monday and I've taken it easy in the Diwali week. So, that means I have to slog it out on the weekend. But surprisingly, I got some productive work done on Saturday. Maybe it was the solitude... since the office was nearly empty. In the afternoon, I go out and play a few games of doubles table tennis with few of the colleagues who have ventured to the office on a Saturday. Work done... play done... I'm happy!!  I blog, describing the evening of 8th November. The reactions to it make me smile! I am happy!!  Then after going home, I watch this delightfully simple and heartwarming film called  Madeline . It tells the story, set in France, of an little orphan girl who saves her school from being sold off. I am happy!!  Finally... at night, just before I go to sleep, I lie in the bed wondering what exactly happiness is!... I sort of try of define happiness and just before I drift off to sleep, I find a definition that I like. But before I tell you all about it... I throw open the question to all you wonderful people...   What is happiness to you?   Tag away... comment in the comments box... mail me... do whatever you like... just let your imagination take you over and try to define what is happiness...  So, there!  cheers!

       Mind your language!    Ash nazg durbatulk, ash nazg gimbatul,  ash nazg thrakatulk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.    I managed to confuse people with that post yesterday! But as an old Hindi song goes...  "... samajhne waale samajh gaye... naasamjhe woh anaadi hai!!"  ;-)  Well... the cryptic sounding words mean the following...    One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them; One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them    To those who still haven't figured it out, these are the words inscribed on the  One Ring , the ring that is main protagonist of the great epic,  The Lord of The Rings , by J.R.R. Tolkien.  J.R.R. Tolkien was a great linguist. He had a deep knowledge of languages, both modern and ancient. He was at home with such diverse languages as, English, French, German, Welsh, Finnish and old Norse. It is this fascination with languages that resonates loud and clear throughout  The Lord of The Rings . Not only was Tolkien an expert at known languages, but he was also an expert in one other unique ability... the talent to create his own languages. He created languages such as Elvish (both,  Quenya  and  Sindarin ), Dwarvish( Khuzdul ), Entish and the Black Speech. He wrote,  "The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse" . Wow!!  Consider the following points...  Saruman's name derives from the Anglo-Saxon, or Old English, root "searu-" for "treachery" or "cunning."  "Sauron" is linked to the Old Norse or Icelandic stem meaning "filth" or "dung" or "uncleanness."  "Mordor" derives from the Old English word "morthor," which means "murder."  "Middle-earth" is related to the name "middan-geard," which was the name for the Earth itself in Old English poetry and was considered to be the battleground between the forces of good and evil.  Tolkien's High Elvish language, Quenya, was inspired by Finnish.  Fascinating, isn't it?! :-)  By the way, the lines that started this post,  i.e.   "Ash nazg..."  are from the  Black Speech . An example of  Quenya , the language of the elves is,  "Elen sila lmenn' omentielvo" , which means  "A star shines on the hour of our meeting." . Another example that can be taken is from the  Dwarwish  language...  "Khazd-ai-mnu!"  which translates to  "The Dwarves are upon you!"  in the language of the Men! :-)  Its just wonderful! ... the world of fantasy in  The Lord of The Rings !!  Have you experienced it yet?! ;-)  cheers!

       Simply barbaric!!  Just the other day I was awaiting my turn in the barbershop, ogling at the actresses in the well-worn magazines. All of a sudden a sense of enlightenment illuminated my cranium. I realized that if you ask a man to list down the people he trusts the most, then one entry would surely be common to many peoples lists. That entry would be the barber.  What??! A barber?!  Well yes, a man seems to trust his barber tremendously. How else can you explain the fact that he coolly submits his head to be manipulated a stranger who with his other hand wields razor-sharp instruments for use on that head. Plus, its a fact that men rarely change their barbers (something to chew about for those marketing type yuppies who talk about brand-loyalty and some such stuff). I think this is what prompted Mark Twain to declare, All things change except barbers.  My earliest memories of visits to barbershops are those of sitting atop two cushions on the barbers chair and looking into the wall of mirror in front of me. The barber was a kindly person who snipped my hair with gentle finesse.  And if I behaved well in the chair then I would get a lollipop at the end of the haircut  (which was quite a treat at that time since lollipops and other sweetmeats were a rarity given the now-you-see-one-now-you-dont condition of my teeth) . Whether it was the lollipop assured at the end of the ordeal or the sweet smell of various creams and lotions on the shelf, I would look forward to these visits to the barbershop accompanied by my mother.  A few years later, having outgrown the phase in which I considered lollipops as treats, my father started taking me along with him to his barber. This gentleman was quite different to the earlier one. He was a stern looking person who would envelope my young head with his huge hands and turn it around while the other hand snipped away with military precision, the errant wisps of hair which dared to stand out of place on my head. The end product of these visits would be close-cropped hair that had me looking like a very young recruit into a military school. I hated this look!  As I entered my teens, I scouted around and found a decent barber who would not have me looking like a porcupine whenever he was finished with me  (well, vanity is a big thing during the teens!) . All throughout my teens and quite a few years after that I stuck with this barber, which bolstered my belief that, men never change barbers. Every month I would make the visit early on a Sunday morning to the barbershop. I would sit down on the chair(now without any pillows of course). The barber would wrap a white cape around me and spray water on my head with an atomizer. Then he would produce combs of various shapes and sizes from the drawer and place them alongside scissors. Then, the master craftsman that he pretended to be would start to ply his trade with adroit precision, snipping away to glory. Being a short and portly figure, he would bustle around me trying to give attention to all the parts of my head. As the clickity clack of the scissors started, I would close my eyes and let the barber take over completely, my neck, pliable and willing in his hands, as he twisted and turned it like a corkscrew. The songs on the radio or the cassette player would almost lull me into a light slumber. My eyes would open only when some cool spirit would be splashed on the back of my neck and behind my ears, ostensibly in an effort to sterilize it before the razor was applied. The razor is used to banish even the littlest outcroppings of hair under the hairline perfectly carved by the able hands of the barber. I would then regard myself long and hard in the bank of mirrors before me, turning my head this way and that. It is essential to be mentioned here that my hairs though abundant in volume, are an unruly lot. They refuse to settle down and stand out from the scalp making me look very much like a porcupine with long quills. For this reason, the barber would keep my hair longer than he normally would, citing the reason that it would be difficult to comb them if they were shortened. As a result I would not look much different after the haircut than before it. Grudgingly then, I would nod my head in response to the barbers inquiring stare. Happy to have satisfied his customer the barber would then proceed to give a small expertly executed massage to my head, which would relax me completely.  As the times changed, the barbers and their tiny barbershops changed too. Slick, air-conditioned parlours replaced the dingy serviceable shops, the barbers themselves started wearing clean and pressed uniforms and started calling themselves hair-dressers or hair-care-specialists  (and other such mighty sounding names) , the unnamed powders and lotions changed to branded products, the old instruments changed to shiny new ones, the whole atmosphere in the barbershop changed to reflect the times. What however did not change was the trust that men had in their barbers. They still go to the same barber even though he charges a lot higher now than in the past and expects a tip every time without exception.  How often do YOU change your barber?!  cheers!

       A crib, a boast and a loopy bridge!   [crib]  Today has been a bit more hectic than normal. One member of our project team resigned and my boss thought it fit to ask me to takeover the responsibilities from that person who resigned. This meant a series of meetings in the afternoon as I was handed over the charge of 4-5 new tasks. And as if this wasn't enough, the formal handover process would last another week at least... which means some more hectic times ahead!  [/crib]   ... a crib followed by a little bit of boasting!...   [brag]  All these new responsibilities and the offer to lead the team sounds good... especially since I'm the newest member of the project team and I've been chosen over the existing, more experienced people in the team! I guess that has something to do with the  outstanding  rating that I recently got in my annual performance appraisal!!  *nose lifted high in the air*   [/brag]   ... now for the spoiler!   [spoiler]  Leading a team and all means zilch in our project team since we are a R&D kind of a project with a hierarchy-less structure and everybody having to put his/her nose to the grindstone and slog their asses off without exception!  [/spoiler]   Well... that was just me being a royal bore... trying to blow my own trumpet!!  (but then... if we had a trumpet, why wouldn't we blow it?! ... I mean its no use having a trumpet and keeping it unused and going about borrowing trumpets from others just to blow them!)  :-|   Not much today from my side!  (hmmm... I can hear a few exclamations of "Thank God!" from the people who found my previous post to be very long and boring!)   Ok... but just before I go... here's a bridge that I wouldn't mind crossing! ;-) ...  urlLink http://www.freewebs.com/supersam5/images/scenic4.jpg   Fancy a ride across it?!  Ok... on that note... I put on the  One  ring and disappear!!  cheers!

       Back!  Well... I'm back! ... after a brief hiatus of three days during which I did not blog, I'm back!  So, what did I do in these three days?! ... Hmmm! ... I had been to Oxford...  of the East !! ...  a.k.a.  Punyanagari ...  a.k.a.  Pune!  I took the day off on Friday and drove down to Pune  (with my parents)  taking the fantastic expressway. In just under two and half hours after leaving our doorstep in Mumbai, I was opening the lock to the door of our house in Pune...  (I can never overstress the joy of driving along the expressway, especially after the slow-as-a-snail drives on Mumbai roads!) .  My main aim while in Pune was to get a few things done at the new house there. The walls needed some painting and the floor needed polishing. But, as it turned out eventually, only the paint job  could be completed while the guy who was supposed to do the floor polishing never turned up even once during the three days I was there! :-/  Most of the day on Friday was hectic, which saw me running around trying to get the painters to start the paint job. These painters were one lazy breed of workers. They did some work for 15-20 minutes and followed it up with an hour of break followed by another brief spell of work. This weird work cycle seemed strange to me at first since I could not understand the logic behind it. After a couple of questions I learnt that these poor guys had been hired to work in night shift at a neighbouring construction site where they painted all night. So it was but natural for them to be exhausted during the day for the want of sleep. But they had no reason to slack for nearly 5 hours out of the 8 hour day-shift they worked on. Totally inexcusable! Common sense and sympathy prevented me from hollering at them. But when they stopped painting an iron railing halfway through the job, because it was 5:30 PM  (end of shift!) , I blew my top and gave them an earful... a very loud earful!! Needless to say... the railing was painted without any further cribbing from those painters! ...  (it was a case of... "Beware the fury of a patient man!")  *LOL*  Saturday was a waste! ... the entire day was spent in watching the painters paint the walls... followed by waching the paint dry!  Have you ever watched paint dry?? ... Try it once... there's hardly any activity more wholesomely fruitless and inane than that!! ... but its good time pass! ;) ... I have to warn you that the smell of the paint might give a  kick  to some people. Its alright if you are interested in sniffing things to get your kicks but for the less-than-exciting personalities like mine... the smell is revolting... especially after being forced to sniff it all day long!  Sunday dawned and brought with it a slight bite in the air... something that had been missing before. The view from our balcony is panoramic. In the distance, from the left, the Bombay-Bangalore highway enters into the field of vision and continues along the base of the hill until the hill is no more. Then the highway curves gently to the right, hugging the hill till it passes out of view, behind it. A little further to the right, a serene Pashan lake breaks the monotony of landscape as a dense, luxuriant growth of trees defies the heat to provide a verdant relief to the eyes scanning the brown, scraggy landscape... (The lake looks especially wonderful at night as the interplay caused by the moonlight and the gentle nightly breeze cause silver shimmers on its surface. The mornings however are an entirely different thing to behold as thick layers of mist cling to the surface of the lake giving it an appearance of a vast snow covered plain!)   Coming back to where I left of... Sunday dawned with an air of anticipation. I was gonna meet people. Some of them after a gap of 3-4 years, while others for the first time. After a quick breakfast I left the house to meet two of my college friends whom I hadn't met for the better part of three years after graduation! It was wonderful to see both of them after a long time and we spent the better part of an hour catching up on old times and recalling some of the events that made our college life so wonderful!  I happened to glance at my watch and realised it was almost 11 AM, the time that I was supposed to meet  urlLink Shuchita  outside  South Winds  on FC Rd. My friends had to leave too, so we said our goodbyes and I made my way to the appointed place. Shuchita had said that she would wear a yellow shirt and blue jeans which would help in recognizing her. In the 10 mins that I waited I saw nearly a dozen girls answering to that description... until an autorickshaw stopped right in front of South Winds Caf and a pretty girl stepped out... wearing a pink shirt and blue jeans. I was almost going to look away  (lest she should catch me staring at her) , when she asked,  "Sameer?" . So!! ... here was Shuchita! The only thought that was running in my mind at that time was,  "This has got to be the pinkest shade of yellow I have ever seen!!" .  We then entered the coffee-shop and chatted over cups of coffee. The chat was basically  get-to-know  kind of chat and in almost no time, an hour passed! Now... it was time for Shuchita  (the shy youth trying to escape reality)  to leave since she had to meet another fellow blogger, Ameya and couple of others. It was a great experience meeting her and I look forward to the next meeting. I had to leave since I had to return to Mumbai immediately after lunch, which consisted of delicious chicken dish  (sober chicken, I'm afraid... not the drunken variety!) .  After lunch and a quick nap  (induced by the chicken... and not Caf Latt!) , I was ready to leave for Mumbai. We packed the bags and set off from Pune... and in exactly 2 hours I was at Sion  (a new record for me!!)  catching almost no traffic along the way. But then it was too good to be true and we caught some really bad mass of traffic at Sion which meant that it took almost 45 mins to reach home from there... a distance normally covered in 10 mins.  So... all in all, a weekend well spent!!  Thats it for now... as you can see  *pointing to this long blog* ... I'm back with a vengeance after the break! ;)  cheers!

        Radio Ga-Ga   Today, while coming back from office, while sitting in the bus, I was listening to radio on my cellphone. I was tuned into   urlLink Win 94.6 FM  , one of the several radio channels that have captured the imagination of the average Mumbaikar since the Government threw open the Mumbai airwaves to private radio broadcasting, earlier this year. The time was just about 9:00 PM and a chirpy duo of DJs gave way to a deeper baritone of Roshan Abbas.  Roshan Abbas hosts a delightful programme called  Khanak , which focusses completely on old Hindi film songs. The best part about it is that they stick very religiously to the condition that songs only upto the 70's decade will be played on air from 9:00 PM to 12:00 midnight, the duration of the programme. Any song, however good or famous, but released after the 70's will not be played. This condition means that for old Hindi film music buffs like me, it presents a veritable feast for the ears. Old, often forgotten, but very melodious songs are the norm. Once the programme starts, I lean back on the backrest of the seat, in the bus, close my eyes and submit myself to the heady magic of those tunes, of an era past!... Mohammad Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Geeta Bali transport me to the time when melody was king. :-)  Completely at an antipode with respect to Khanak is the programme that is broadcast at 7:00 AM on the same radio channel. Hosted by probably the chirpiest and most effervescent DJ on radio, Malishka, this programme starts off my day on the right note!... Well, it managed to drive away my Monday blues today morning, as a result of which I was in a good mood for the rest of the day.  Hmm... that's enough about radio, I suppose!  Well, today I downloaded the trailor of  The Two Towers , the second instalment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy  (actually, its not a trilogy! ... its just one story split up into three parts!) . I'm currently reading  The Two Towers  and as I was seeing the trailor, I just couldn't help but feel amazed... since what I saw in the trailor was the exactly the way that I had visualized the scenes while reading the book... exactly!! Now, I just can't wait for the film to be released so that I can go and see it!!! :-) Thanks to  urlLink Teshu  because it was from his blog that I came across the link to the trailor of this film!  That's all that I can think of at this moment! ... suddenly my brain has clammed up and I have hit a writer's block... for the moment! ;-)  cheers!

        A little bit of good old Sunday blogging!   This post is a first in a couple of ways. This is the first time I'm posting a full length blog from home. All my earlier blogs have been from the office. The reason for this has been the fact that I invariably return home from office at around 2130 to 2200 hours daily. After which, I'm too pooped out to start the PC, let alone sit and write. Oh well! ... enough of cribbing! ... So! ... this is my first post from the home!... that's one of the firsts!  The second first  (if ever there is such thing as a second first!... hehehe)  is that this is the first time I'm posting a blog through any place other than the standard web-based blogging interface available at  urlLink Blogger . I've posted this blog using  urlLink w.bloggar , the freeware tool that makes the blogging experience so easy. The biggest advantage of using  w.bloggar  is that it provides a one-stop solution to write a post, edit it, format it, do a spell check on it,  connect to  Blogger  and post/publish the blog there... all using just a single application!... and without having to connect to the Net except to post/publish the post. The text editing and formatting facilities in  w.bloggar  are extremely powerful and easy to use. Most of these features that it provides are available only to premium  (read, paid!)  users of  Blogger . It also provides a way to edit/change the template or the layout of your blog page. Moreover  w.bloggar  is available for blogging on many blogging systems,  e.g.  Blogger, Movable Type, Nucleus, Blogworks XML, etc.. Wow!  Ha ha! ... that looked quite like a marketing effort on behalf of  w.bloggar . Well... let me assure you... it wasn't! ... I'm just very impressed by it... that's all! :-)  So... back to the business of blogging...  Yesterday I had my second session with my dentist... and it lasted longer than the first one. Now I  boast  of a composite filling in one of my molars. It looks quite like the  natural colour  of the teeth and its difficult to make out that the tooth has been filled. But the process of filling, itself, was quite lengthy and complex. This composite filling forms a chemical bond with the tooth and that's how it stays in place. So, the existing temporary filling had to be extricated completely. Even this time, the drill and the probe caused no pain at all, prompting the dentist to remark,  "You came to me for treatment just in the nick of time. If the caries had progressed a little further, it would have reached the nerve and then there would have been no way out of it other than getting a Root Canal done, and believe me that hurts!" .   "Thank God!" , I said and the dentist nodded saying,  "Yes!... thank god!" . Then, as I was lying, almost horizontal, on the reclined chair, she  (the dentist)  produced a an instrument that looked very much like a small hair dryer... with a thin glass tube sticking out of its front. I though that I would scream bloody murder if she put that thing in my mouth to work on my poor teeth! But all I did was to bunch up my eyebrows and show a frightened look in my eyes  (I just couldn't scream since my mouth was full of a suction pump and a probe) .   "Don't worry!... It's just a gun!" , said the dentist, sweetly and matter-of-factly! A gun!!?... Some more frightened expression in my eyes!... and the eyebrows... up and bunched together!  "Ahh!... don't worry! ... It's just a UV-gun. Ultra-violet light helps the filling to bond faster with the teeth and helps it dry faster" , came the explanation. That relaxed me no end and I let the treatment continue till my tooth was filled and looked much... much better than it did a couple of weeks ago!  Well that's it about how Saturday went... Today,  i.e.  has been as relaxed and  Sunday-like  as it can get. I had been watching the final one-dayer between India and West Indies. But after the abject surrender by the Indians facing a huge total, I lost interest and instead read the newspaper. There are a couple of stories in it that caught my eye...  The venue of the Miss World pageant has been shifted to London after the mindless violence that took place in Nigeria, the original venue. How dumb can people get!!? 105 dead and over 500 injured in rioting over a beauty contest!... oh c'mon!!! :-/  Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra, the  heiress-apparent  to the legacy of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty  (ohh puhleeeze!)  seems to be finally taking the long-awaited plunge into the murky world of politics. And how!! It seems she visited a police station in the high-profile Amethi constituency and forced the police officers there to file a FIR alleging that a BJP leader in the area had dismantled the house of a poor dalit named Shambhunath.  "UP ki aandhi, Priyanka Gandhi" , it seems is the latest buzzword in and around Amethi.  Theres good news for all the Tintin fans  (which includes me!!) . Steven Spielberg has decided to bring the young cartoon detective to life on the big screen. He is currently negotiating the rights to the character with the firm that owns them. Well, finally!! ... we will get to see Tintin on the silver screen... and who better to do it than Steven Spielberg!! :-)  On that happy note... I'll take your leave!...  cheers!

        World AIDS Day   Today is the first day of December. Already?!! ... Gosh!... 2002 has flown so quickly.  The world over, 1 st  of December is observed as the  World AIDS Day . It is the day on which mankind renews its pledge to fight the menace of  AIDS . The  A cquired  I mmuno  D eficiency  S yndrome is probably the biggest medical challenge faced by mankind since the start of life on the planet Earth. It is no surprise therefore that the maximum amount of medical research is aimed at combating this disease and halting its exponential spread  (which is already at epidemic proportions!) .  More than the medical challenge that the disease represents, the social challenges that it has created, are much more tougher to face and counter. And the only way to fight the social battle against  AIDS  is through education and awareness. Even after many years people still are not even aware of the threat posed by  AIDS  and even if they do, they still have many misconceptions about it. They still think AIDS can spread through contact. They still think a person with  HIV  infection already has AIDS. They still think the best way to treat an  AIDS  patient is to isolate him and ostracize him from the community. The list of misconceptions just goes on and on... and on! Education and awareness is the need of the hour, and more money and resources, than are currently used, should be  devoted to this cause than spending millions upon millions on the medical research  (which of course is very important too!)    urlLink www.linkandthink.org  has come up with a novel concept of spreading awareness about  AIDS  and resources related to combating it, in the online world. It has urged webmasters and webloggers the world over, to blog  (on December 1 st )  about  AIDS , about the efforts that are going on to halt its spread and about the efforts that are going into educating the masses.  So, I thought... why not contribute my mite towards this praiseworthy initiative  (and I urge you to do so too! ... just one day, at least!) .  First of all... some staggering statistics...  As of 31st October 2002, the total number of   reported    AIDS  cases in India was   41606   (  31230   males and   10376   females) with about   900   cases being reported every month!! And this is just the reported number. The actual number has to be so staggering that it is beyond my comprehension!!! Well,  84.30%  of these cases were infected through sexual transmission,  3.01%  cases through improper transfusion of blood and blood products,  2.93%  cases were infected through use of unsafe injectable instruments and  2.60%  cases were infected via perinatal transmission. If we look at these figures geographically, Tamil Nadu tops the list of most infected states in India with   18276  AIDS  cases reported. Maharashtra comes next with   8723   cases. Arunachal Pradesh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Lakshadweep are at the bottom of the list with   no   cases of  AIDS  reported from there. Mumbai alone has around 1165 cases of  AIDS  patients.  Don't get misled by figures though! ... You know what they say about icebergs, don't you?! By the way, these statistics were courtesy of the  HIV/AIDS Surveillance of India , carried out by  National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) , India.  Now, a whole host of programmes will be organized all over the world on the account of  World AIDS Day . One such event that is being organized in Mumbai is  Hope 2002 - Second International Conference on Substance Abuse and HIV . It will commence today and continue for three days, at the Taj Mahal Hotel, Mumbai and is being organized by the  Drug Abuse Information Rehabilitation and Research Centre (DIARRC) .  There are of course many many other campaigns initiated by various NGOs. One such awareness campaign being run in Mumbai is the thought-provoking campaign run by  MDACS , which asks the question...   Balbir Pasha ko AIDS hoga kya?  .  And finally, how can the entertainment industry lag behind??... MTV India has organized the   MTV Music Summit for AIDS  , to be held 5 PM onwards today at the MMRDA grounds, Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai, aimed at spreading  AIDS  awareness. It will be graced by artistes of the likes of Alisha, Bombay Vikings, KK, Mahalaxmi, Mehnaz, Shaan, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, Shweta Shetty, Silk Route & Vasundhara Das. Bollywood stars like Bipasha Basu, Jackie Shroff, John Abraham, Sharad Kapoor and Pooja Bhatt, etc. will also be there.  Then there is the   Levi's&reg; Battle Against AIDS Rock Concert    at Hamsadhwani Theatre, Pragati Maidan, New Delhi. It is sponsored by  Levi Strauss Foundation  in association with  Freedom Foundation , an NGO working with AIDS patients. It will feature the country's finest rock music talent. New Delhi's Them Clones, Envision and Orange Street, Chennai's Moksha and Mumbai's Pentagram will rock the evening in New Delhi.  However, all this is nothing when one matches this against the ceseless, selfless and tireless work carried out by the foot soldiers of various NGOs and Governmental organizations at the grass-roots level to educate the masses to fight the battle against  AIDS . While more  (lot more)  needs to be done, this is a small step and being an optimistic, I'm sure, by contributing bit by one tiny bit, we will triumph over the evil Dark Lord called  AIDS .  cheers!

You can always see the "Silver Lining" to every dark and dreary cloud. Look at the bright side is your motto and understanding why everything happens for the best is your goal. You are the positive optimist of the world who provides the hope for all humankind. There is nothing so terrible that you can not find some good within it. On the positive side, you are spontaneous, charismatic, idealistic and empathic. On the negative side, you may be a sentimental dreamer who is emotionally impractical.

        That, my friends, was my weekend...   Yesterday was a busy day. I got up at 9:00 AM for a 9:30 AM dentist appointment and the next half hour was spent at a frenetic pace trying to cram in the whole range of morning ablutions in the impossible space of 1800 seconds!  At 9:30 Am, I was brushed, shaved, washed, fed and re-brushed... and ready to face the rigours of the dentist's chair. The one-hour-long appointment stretched to 90 minutes as the dentist discovered a particuarly intriguing piece of cavity in the far, unexplored recesses of my dental framework. As she  (the dentist)  excavated this exciting new discovery, drill that was at work on that tooth caused me pain. It was that kind of pain which made me clasp the armrests till my knuckles turned white and my toes curled up!  After the ordeal at the dentist, the trip to the office was another ordeal as it took me nearly 2 hours to cover the distance that I cover in just about an hour everyday. Then at the office, I spent the next few hours trying to set up a wireless LAN. But a persistant compilation bug kept me on my toes and prevented me from competing the setup. Finally I gave up and left it for Monday.  If yesterday was busy, today was relaxed... as all Sundays should be!! ;-)  In the evening, I planned to go and check out some stuff at the Heera Panna shopping arcade. But when I got there  (Haji Ali) , I found that it was completely shut due to some renovation work. So, I walked a bit and came to  Crossword , the bookstore at Mahalakshmi and spent around an hour browsing through the huge collection of titles there. I bought,  Life of Pi  by  Yann Martel ,  The Alchemist  by  Paul Coelho ,  Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe  by  Fannie Flagg  and  The Dilbert Future  by  Scott Adams . My reading list just got bigger!! ;-)  I am trying to decide which book I should take up for reading next, now that  The Lord of the Rings  is nearing completion  (I've reached the second part of The Return of The King, i.e. Book Six) . Any suggestions?!! :-)  Ummmm... well, that's it for now!  cheers!

Assurances first!  (for those who care enough for them, anyways!)  This is  not  a notice for my blog to  R.I.P. . This is neither an indication of my dis-enchantment with blogging or a sign of exhaustion of my enthusiasm for blogging!  I'm going off on a hiatus for the remainder of this year. The activity, though, will continue in the background as major changes are effected here.   I'll be back!

       I took another quiz!  This was not like the other foolish and inane quizzes that we take normally. It was  urlLink The Ecological Footprint Quiz 2002 .  Here's what it was all about...  Ever wondered how much "nature" your lifestyle requires? You're about to find out. This Ecological Footprint Quiz estimates how much productive land and water you need to support what you use and what you discard. After answering 15 easy questions you'll be able to compare your Ecological Footprint to what other people use and to what is available on this planet.  And the result was quite interesting. It seems my Ecological Footprint is   1.6 Global Hectares  !! Now they have calculated that currently, worldwide, there exists  1.8  biologically productive Global Hectares per person. So, going by that account, I am within the world average and so I pose very little threat to the world's ecosystem!  But, the average figures for India indicate that Indians, on an average, posses an ecological footprint of   0.8 Global Hectares  per person. So, going by that number, I'm a glutton as far as my consumption of ecological resources, in the National context, are concerned!! ...  Bad Boy !!!  So, go ahead, measure your footprint and be ecologically aware!!  Being Green is cool!

       urlLink Indians pay Rs 26,728 cr as bribe annually. - The Times of India   Indians spend a whopping Rs 26,728 crore annually on paying bribes with the health sector being one of the most corrupt fields, a survey conducted by a non-government organisation, Transparency International India in collaboration with ORG-Marg,  said.  Are we a nation of ethically corrupt masses? ... Or are we just a nation of people tired to cut through the bureaucratic red-tape? ... so tired, that we prefer to pay bribes rather than suffer inordinate delays in whatever we try to do?  We all make noises that we should decrease corruption and stop paying bribes. But do we pay any heed to our own voices? Is this our motto...  What we need is either less corruption, or more chance to participate in it.   And, honestly, how many times did you have to pay bribes during the last one year?

       A group of information technology companies published a specification Thursday designed to improve the reliability of business applications that use Web services.  The specification, WS-Reliability, which will be submitted to a standards body in a few weeks, was written by a number of companies, including Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Sonic Software. If accepted as a standard and adopted by Web services providers, will let a company ensure that a message sent between two different applications is delivered reliably. For example, a company could send a purchase order to a supplier via a Web service and be guaranteed that the message was either successfully delivered and performed its function, or that the transmission failed. Currently, businesses working with Web services can make sure their communications are reliable using specialized software or other established products. WS-Reliability seeks to create a standardized method that is widely supported. Read  urlLink more .  [via  urlLink CNet News.com ]

       What happens when, in a team sport, one individual, plays above his abilities on a particular day?!! ... His team wins!!  That's exactly what happened today. India won its first match on the New Zealand tour, propelled by the all round performance of  Zaheer Khan . Following up his fantastic first spell of bowling, in which he removed 3 top order New Zealand batsmen, Zaheer scored an unbeaten 34  (in 42 balls with 2 fours and a six)  to guide India to a win which looked elusive when he came in to bat at the fall of the seventh wicket with 53 runs still to be scored for victory.  Without doubt, Zaheer is my Man of the Match!!

       What would happen if the Sun suddenly disappeared from the centre of the Solar System??   Well, the first thing that comes to mind is that we would be plunged into darkness  (literally, not figuratively!!) . But that won't happen for 8.3 minutes after the Sun has disappeared, since light takes 8.3 minutes to travel from the Sun to the Earth.  Another thing would also happen. We all know that the Earth stays in its orbit mainly due to the gravitational pull exerted by the Sun. So, if the Sun disappears, so will the pull!  Ummm... how long would it be before Earth flies off the tangent and into the big Unknown?! ... Well, that depends on the speed of gravity. So... what is the speed of gravity?!!  Before yesterday, it was generally believed that Gravity travelled at the speed of light. But no one could prove it. Yesterday  (7th Jan 2003) , two scientists, Ed Fomalont and Sergei Kopeikin announced that they have succeeded in measuring the speed of Gravity for the first time ever. They have established that Gravity does indeed travel at the speed of light. Check it out  urlLink here .  So, coming back to our problem of the Sun disappearing, we now know that the Earth would remain in orbit for about 8.3 minutes - the time it takes light to travel from the Sun to the Earth. Then, suddenly feeling no gravity, Earth would shoot off into space in a straight line!!  So, keep those space-pods and space-suits ready and be ready to take off in under 8.3 minutes if you hear the news that the Sun has disappeared!! ;-)

      This is what, Bruce Bartlett, a syndicated columnist says in his  urlLink column  in  urlLink The Washington Times ,   I think blogging is one of the most interesting ways in which the Internet empowers people. They cost almost nothing to put up and they allow anyone with an opinion the ability reach millions of people instantly and simultaneously. Blogs have become a kind of early warning system for me, alerting me about things like Trent Lott's political problems days before it appeared in the conventional press. Blogs are here to stay and their power will only grow. I think they are going to revolutionize politics and newsgathering permanently.

       A life in bits and bytes . In the July 1945 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, tech visionary Vannevar Bush had written of a future personal device in which an individual could store all his books, records, communications, etc. and which could be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. Bush envisaged it to be an  enlarged intimate supplement to an individual's memory .  Now, fifty-seven years later, Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell, working in a Microsoft project at the Bay Area Research Centre in San Francisco, has sort of realized Vannevar Bush's vision.  He has developed a prototype of the device envisaged by Bush and since 1998, he's been recording his life in bits and bytes.  urlLink Read  Gordon Bell's interview that recently appeared on  urlLink CNet News.com .

Sir Ian McKellen  (who plays the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings trilogy)  and Christopher Lee were also touted as possible contenders to play the role of Prof. Albus Dumbledore, but both of them said they were not interested.  I always felt that Richard Harris  (may he rest in peace)  was the perfect choice for the role of Prof. Dumbledore... just as Ian McKellen fits like a glove in the chracter of Gandalf in LoTR movies.

         Disclaimer:  The following article is not written by me and does not reflect my views. I do not wish to pass judgement on any individual or any organization by posting this article. This came to me in mail.      Who is Reliance trying to fool ?   The Media has been going ga-ga about Reliance Infocomm's new Pioneer Offer. Everybody has nothing but good things to say about it, but has anybody bothered analyzing the offer?  It isn't all as rosy as it seems.  First of all, NO, the mobile phone isn't free; it's a hidden cost and a big one as we will soon see.  Second, you pay a hefty Rs. 3,000 as Club Membership fees, which entitle you to receive privileged services like game downloads, ringtones, and a more of such freebies. A marketing booklet with discount coupons worth Rs. 1 Lac also comes along (come on Reliance, a Mid-Day newspaper does a better job at giving us free coupons).  Third, all the billing money for three years has to be pledged to Reliance in the form of post dated cheques, or full upfront payment, and no, there isn't a trial period for the service. If you choose to exit the plan in the first year, no matter what the reason might be, you stand to lose the mobile phone, club membership charges, and Rs. 100 from each of your post-dated cheques.  Fourth, all seemingly free services like Voice Mail, Call Divert, Call Conferencing and Data Connectivity (Internet Services) are billed to you at regular talktime rates according to Reliance's Website. As for those who consider that airtime rates are quite cheap, let's analyze it a little further.  Reliance bills at Rs. 1,800 per quarter, and the club membership of Rs. 3,000 is compulsory and non refundable. That makes a total of Rs. 24,600 for three years. [3000 security + (1800 x 4 quarters x 3 years)].  In return you get 400 minutes of talktime free each month. i.e. 14,400 minutes for 3 years.  Divide the two and you will realise that each minute within plan limits ends up costing you around Rs. 1.71 or Rs. 5.13 for a three minute standard call . And once the plan's call time is up, you pay standard BSNL/MTNL landline fees. This implies that every call you make is getting you closer to bearing the cost of owning the mobile phone.  Let's deduct the price of the handset from the amount you pay to Reliance and see the difference. Reliance claims the phone costs around Rs. 10,500, but we don't believe that is a fair estimate. Considering they buy it in bulk and the options are fairly limited, let's place the price of the handset at Rs. 7,600.  [my take on this: I disagree. For one I do not subscribe to the argument that since they get cheaper prices in bulk, they necessarily have to pass down the same price to the customer. Another thing is that I do not, for a moment believe that a CDMA phone can come for under 10K. But those are just my views!]   The total fee for the new plan without mobile phone will then amount to Rs. 17,000 (Rs. 24,600 - Rs. 7,600). The total cost-per- minute at Rs. 1.18 in this case is still more than that of the basic telephony providers they vie to replace.  Though cheaper than other mobile phone services, it is still costlier than a landline. This, despite the fact that setting up a CDMA2000x1 network costs less than landline based solutions, and the TRAI is offering Reliance a good deal via free interconnect with BSNL/MTNL.  The quality and features, Reliance has been harping on will be seen in time. But, some basic misconceptions which give the deal a greater than god image can be cleared right away.  The SMS facility on Reliance phones is limited to sending and receiving messages to Reliance phones only. It isn't possible to send or receive SMS messages to/from standard GSM mobile phones. So SMS being free isn't too good an option unless Reliance is a monopoly, which, if and when it becomes one, will make them charge for it.  The low-cost STD calls too are for Reliance-to-Reliance phones only. If you wish to call up a standard land line, you pay standard MTNL/BSNL charges.  All this, and a lot more needs to be explained in clearer terms for the consumer to gauge how well this plan meets her data/telecom needs.  Services that Reliance claims it will offer need to be explained in a lot more detail to make it clear to the customer about what exactly she's going to get. As for whether the service would really deliver what it claims; only time will tell.  We would rather sit back and watch the playing field level up, and then pick the tried and tested option that has proven its performance.   Well!! .... what do you people think?? Does this make sense or is it just a ranting of an iconoclast? Leave your comments...

       Microsoft Ordered to Ship Java in 120 Days . According to  urlLink report  published on  urlLink Reuters , a federal judge on Wednesday ordered Microsoft Corp. to begin shipping Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java program within 120 days, after the companies fought over implementing a ruling he made last month.  Sun had complained in a court filing that Microsoft wanted to take up to a year before including the Java program to copies of Windows it sells.  Microsoft told U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz that shipping Java with Windows was not a simple matter and a sudden change in the operating system could harm large corporate users of Windows.  But Motz ruled, "I can't sit here hearing after hearing, I want this done in 120 days."  And so, Microsoft had to eat the humble pie... for once!   (I still get a niggling feeling that Microsoft will wriggle out of this hole too!)

       Tilgul ghyaa ani god god bola  goes the popular phrase in Marathi  (my mother-tongue) . Roughly translated into English, it means " Have this  Tilgul  (a sweet made of Sesame seeds and jaggery) and talk sweetly ". It's a greeting that is exchanged on the day of  Makar Sankranti , an Indian festival that falls every year on January 14th.  According to  urlLink Hindunet ,  urlLink Makar Sankranti  marks the beginning of  Uttarayan , the Sun's northward journey.  Makar  is called Capricorn in the western astrological calendar.  Makar Sankranti  falls on 14th of January every year. The day and night on  Makar Sankrant  are of exactly of equal hours. This day is observed as the most auspicious day by the Hindus all over the country. In the south of India, this festival is popular as   Pongal  .  Though the festival is celebrated differently in the country, it is significant to note that  Til  seeds (sesame seeds) and jaggery are used everywhere. Obviously, to combat the chilly winter,  til  oil is used along with jaggery.  Til  contains oil and it is healthy. Being soft, exchanging  til  seeds or products made from  til  means an exchange of love and tender feelings.   Makar Sankranti  is a major festival in Maharashtra, especially in the rural areas where the harvest season begins on this day. Laddus made from  Til  and jaggery,  Tilgul s made from  til  and sugar are offered to each other as a wish for prosperity, health and happiness. These tokens symbolize one's wish for other people to say sweet words and have sweet and soft feelings to one and all. That's why the phrase " Tilgul ghya ani god god bola! ".  So... Happy  Makar Sankranti  and Happy  Pongal  to you all!!  And, belated  Lohri  wishes to all the Punjabi people  (a certain Sukhwinder included!) !! Hope you had fun yesterday! :-)

       Flexing the Indian Nuclear muscle.  Humphrey Hawksley, a BBC correspondent recently visited Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) at Trombay in Mumbai where over 15,000 people work in laboratories that are hewn under mountians, adding muscle to India's Nuclear arsenal. There, he is told that the pit - the nuclear element - is made at BARC.  Explaining th process of assembling a nuclear weapon, he is told, " The pit goes into the warhead. And the warhead is kept in another place. And the delivery system - that is an aircraft, a missile of a submarine - is in another place again. It would take something from six to eight hours - maximum 12 hours to get the complete weapon assembled and ready to launch. Then it would take about 11 minutes to impact on Pakistan. "  This, coupled with the fact that India follows a no-first-use policy, clearly means that India is ready to absorb one nuclear strike,  i.e.  it's ready to sacrifice at least one city before it gathers its wits and weapons to hit back with everything its got!  So, which are the scapegoat cities??! ... the cities that are expendable... the ones whose loss can be thought of as just a collateral damage!

       Now surf four times faster with a new wonder browser created by a 16 year old  young scientist .  A computer browser that is said to least quadruple surfing speeds on the Internet has won the top prize at an Irish exhibition for young scientists, it was announced on Saturday. Adnan Osmani, 16, a student at Saint Finian's College in Mullingar, central Ireland spent 18 months writing 780,000 lines of computer code to develop the browser. Known as "XWEBS", the system works with an ordinary Internet connection using a 56K modem on a normal telephone line.  Adnan states that the browser features built-in access to 120 Internet search engines, a variety of music and video players including a DVD player and a talking figure, Phoebe who can read out web-pages. You can read more about this story  urlLink here   Hmmmm!! ... first of all 780,000 lines of code in 18 months comes around to 1500 lines per day... something of a wonder in itself! Secondly... if the browser features all these goodies, it has to be super bulky! So, there are sceptics aplenty... and with good reason too!  [via  urlLink Slashdot ]

Interviewer:"I'm sitting here with the latest entry into the presidential race Calvin and his running mate Hobbes. This is the first time a grade schooler and a stuffed tiger have declared themselves eligible for the Oval Office.  Gentlemen, er, um make that Mr. Calvin and uh, well... Got it! Fellow mammals, there is no denying your success in the world of comics. And unlike the other candidates you will not have to achieve name recognition. But what people want to know is will you be able to make the transition   from the funnies to the Presidency?"  Calvin:"Considering the last two presidents would have been more successful on the Sunday comics than in office, I don't see why not."  Interviewer:"But what about you, Hobbes?  Since you only exist in the mind of a grade schooler there's no way you can serve any useful function as VP, except as entertainment for the press.  Don't you think that will hurt your election chances?"  Calvin:"Look at Dan Quayle."  Interviewer:"Good point.  But the constitution requires candidates to be 35."  Calvin:"I'm old enough as long as I have this!" (produces a small card and hands it to the interviewer)  Interviewer:"But this is your father's driver licence with your picture pasted over his and his name crossed out and "Calvin" written in crayon!"  Calvin:"Shhh, not so loud.  I only have to show it once and after it's been through the wash a few times no one will be able to tell."  Interviewer:"Well, best of luck.  Let's move onto the issues.  As I understand it if elected you will pay off the deficit by slashing the defense budget to nothing.  What will you do if someone like Saddam Hussein decides to annex the U.S.?"  Calvin:"No problem, Hobbes will eat 'em."  Interviewer:"What?"  Calvin:"Hobbes will eat 'em. Tigers are good for that. Show him Hobbes."  Hobbes:"Grrrrr."  Interviewer:"But he's just a stuffed tiger!"  Hobbes:"Grrrooowwlll!"  Calvin:"Boy, it's a good thing I fed him before we got here. He doesn't like to be called a stuffed tiger."  Interviewer:"But, but, but... never mind.   What about gun control?"  Calvin:"Guns don't kill people, people don't kill people, bullets kill people!  I figure if people want guns, that's fine. We just outlaw bullets."  Interviewer:"Don't you think that criminals will be able to get bullets anyway?  What about the police, will they have bullets?"  Calvin:"The police won't need bullets because I'll tranmorgify them into dinosaurs. I'm partial to Tyrannosaurs Rexes but anything big will work."  Interviewer:"Transmogrify?"  Calvin:"Sure, with my transmogrifier over there." (Points to overturned cardboard box with TRANSMOGRIFIER written on it)  Interviewer:"Amazing what they can do with corrugated cardboard and a crayon, isn't it?"  Calvin:"Sure.  I built it myself!  You just turn the dial to what ever you want and crawl inside and it changes you. Right now it can only change you into a Tyrannosaurs Rex and a Tiger, but I left some room to write more things down."  Interviewer:"But it's not big enough to hold a big dinosaur!"  Calvin:"Well there are still a few bugs that I'm working on, like changing back to a human afterwards, but I figure after I become Grand Poobah of the Universe I'll be able to get as big a box as I need."  Interviewer:"Grand Poobah of the Universe?"  Calvin:"That's going to be my first action.  President Calvin sounds so bland compared to Calvin, Grand Poobah of the Universe."  Interviewer:"Let's talk about your election chances.  Are you runnin as a Democrat, Republican or Independent?"  Calvin:"All of them."  Interviewer:"But, but, you can't *do* that!"  Calvin:"There's nothing in the rules that says you can't run as all three, besides I figure I'll get more votes that way."  Interviewer:"Can't argue with logic like that.  But, realistically, what do yo think your chances are entering this late in the race with no campaign manager, funds or even a coherent advertising strategy?"  Calvin:"Pretty good considering I'll be running unopposed."  Interviewer:"What about Bush, Clinton and Perot?"  Calvin:"No problem, Hobbes will eat 'em."  Hobbes:"Growl!"  Interviewer:"What?!  You just can't eat your opposition!"  Calvin:"There's nothing in the rules that says, "No tigers eating opposing candidates."  Just keep it under your hat because Hobbes will have an easier time if they don't expect him to pounce them. I figure it's not my fault that none of the other candidates choose tigers as VP.  Interviewer:"I can guarantee that you'll have a monopoly on tigers as running mates.  What is your stand on education?"  Calvin:"I hate it.  We should outlaw it.  Who needs to add anyway? That's what we have calculators for.  I figure if you can't learn it by watching TV isn't worth knowing."  Interviewer:"What kind of country are we going to become if we have no education system.?"  Calvin:"I didn't say we should all be ignorant.  I'll just modify my transmogrifier to include genius and anyone who wants to be smarter can be."  Interviewer:"Have you ever smoked a marijuana cigarette?"  Calvin:"I don't even know what that is.  Once I bought a pack of candy cigarettes and put one in my mouth in front of my mom.  When she told me not to smoke I ate it.  It was great!"  Interviewer:"You don't know what marijuana is?  How are you going to effectively enforce drug laws?"  Calvin:"I don't think enforcement will be a problem if the entire police force consists of Tyrannosaurs Rexes!"  Interviewer:"Sorry, I forgot about that.  By the way what exactly is your platform?"  Calvin:"A cookie jar in every kitchen and a transmogrifier in every garage."  Interviewer:"Interesting.  We're almost out time, so just one more question.  What will you do if no one votes for you?"  Calvin:"They'd better, or else."  Interviewer:"Or else what? Wait don't tell me, let me guess. Hobbes will eat them, right?  Calvin:(smiles)  Hobbes:"Growf?"  Calvin:"Don't worry Hobbes.  If you can't eat that many people will transmogrify some people into tigers to give you a hand."  Hobbes:"An eminently wise decision, my friend."  Interviewer:"Well I guess that concludes this interview.  Normally I would say these two jokers have a snowball's chance in hell of making it but something tells me they might just have something. If, come November, we are swearing in a Grand Poobah of the Universe and are wondering if the VP has fleas, just point me towards the nearest transmogrifier, I'm going to join the police force!"  LOL ;-)

       Posters for Peace . Just got this link from  urlLink Metafilter . A collection of posters, in PDF format, to protest against the mindless and needless war that may erupt in Iraq.  On my part, I'm not going to print the posters. Instead I'll put up a poster here on this site with a link to http://www.protestposters.org/  If you believe that the Bush's campaign against Iraq is unjustified, then maybe you could do the same. :-)

It's called " Query by Humming ," a type of melody recognition software program on display at this week's Midem music conference in Cannes that identifies a song by title and composer based on a person humming a few bars into a microphone.

       Big Brother wants to fry your computers . While the whole world witnesses a tirade by a Bush-led US against Iraq's so-called non-compliance with the UN diktats, the US Air Force is working on developing a man-made bolt of lightning powerful enough to fry sophisticated computers and electronic components in weapons.  US researchers are looking at ways of putting so-called High-Powered Microwave (HPM) beams on aircraft and cruise missiles. The short, intense burst of energy would be lethal to electronics but have no effect on people.  Aerospace experts have suggested an experimental version of the weapon could be used in a war against Iraq, carried on a cruise missile or unmanned aircraft.  Ahhh!... is that why US wants a war with Iraq???... to test its weapons systems prototypes??... and to keep its war industry in business!  Read more  urlLink here

       Speaking about fairy tales   (which are in vogue nowadays, thanks to  urlLink Maltesh  and  urlLink Anya ) ,  would the news of discovery of  sprites  and  elves  dancing on thunder clouds, interest you?!  If yes, then read  urlLink this  report which announces that Sprites and Elves dancing on thunder clouds have been captured by cameras on the space shuttle Columbia.  The report however quashes any hopes of finding these fantasy creatures, when it describes further, "The sprites, which are red flashes of electricity shooting up from thunderclouds 13 miles (20 km) into the ionosphere, and elves, which are glowing red doughnut shapes radiating 190 miles (300 km), were photographed Sunday by astronaut Dave Brown on the sprite hunt's first orbit."  * LOL * ... so much for fairy tales!! ;-)

       [via  urlLink Slashdot ] . According to a  urlLink news story  published in a South African news site  urlLink BusinessDay , South African government has decided to adopt open source software and develop support programs with local research institutes and universities. The CIO of the State IT Agency says: " The logic for open-source is so compelling that after a year of debates we decided to stop talking and declare government an open- source zone. "  This came after the simmering resentment, towards incessant expense of buying software licences for hundreds of thousands of staff spread across government departments, finally boiled over after Microsoft's decision last year that it was introducing a new license model for its software.  I think the trend of Governments migrating to Open Source for their IT needs, is spreadign right across the world. When Bill Gates was here in India, a month or so back, his primary aim was to influence the various Indian state governments to desist from crossing over from Microsoft to Open Source. So, are we going to see a Gates trip to South Africa?? ;-)

      Just came across this story. Got it in a mail. Found it mildly interesting. Maybe  urlLink Gaurav  who's in Lucknow, can verify! ;-)  So, here it is...  Love is known to make people do the unthinkable but few except the Zoo authorities in Lucknow could have imagined it doing the same for an 800 pound elephant.  Thanks to a " love therapy " used by local officials, Sumit, Lucknow city's most rowdy elephant, is well on his way to become its most well behaved.  The 10-year-old pachyderm had, since his inception into the zoo in 1994, displayed excessive moodiness and refused to be tamed. Things took a turn for the worse when Sumit entered adolescence, his violent fits increased and zoo officials were often forced to run for cover.  Kishan, Sumit's mahout, recalls a recent incident when Sumit attacked him and other officials. "The elephant went berserk and started attacking us. We tried to tie him up but he was too violent, we had to run," said Kishan.  Perturbed by his constant mood swings and tired of trying conventional measures, the zoo authorities then introduced "Jiamala", a sober pachyderm beauty, into the picture. Much to their relief the move clicked and smitten by the full 670 pound of her, Sumit today is a changed personality. Though still chained he fondly watches over his sweetheart, who is tied right opposite him, as he allows the mahout to scrub him.  Eva Sharma, director, Lucknow Zoo, agrees that Sumit has shown a remarkable improvement in his behaviour but adds that he will have to be chained for some more time as a precautionary measure.  "Right now he (Sumit) is looking very normal and calm. We gave him a good bath today and he was very obliging, he also allowed himself to be chained without any hassles. He was  fully cooperative, but we will still keep Sumit in chains as a matter of precaution. Our mahouts will make sure that he gets his daily walk within the Zoo premises," she said.  Sumit will stay under observation for another two weeks before he is allowed a full 24-hour stay with his sweetheart.  Hmmmmm! :-)

      I'm extremely proud and excited to announce that my friend, a classmate, from my schooldays is going to represent India at the  British Formula Ford 1800 Zetec series . He and his two team-mates have been selected from India by the reputed  Peter Chambers Racing Team  from Britain. British Formula Ford is the racing series, that is considered to be a very promising stepping stone to the super exclusive Formula One circuit. What makes this even more exciting and prestigious is that, the only other Indian to have been previosuly selected to represent India at this racing series has been Narain Karthikeyan.   Amit Kowli (my friend), Rohan Kowli (his younger bro) and Kunal Shah form the trinity that comprises of the  REVS MOTORSPORT TEAM . These three have great racing credentials, having mastered the Karting circuits in India. Now they set their sights on the Formula Ford championships, considered by many experts as the first step towards the Formula One dream. Of course, there are lots more milestones to achieve and many steps to take before that happens. There are still circuits like Formula Renault, Formula Three, etc. to go before the big league. But they have taken the first step and that is the most important thing, especially in a country like India where the racing infrastructure is next to being absent.  Currently, REVS MOTORSPORT TEAM is being sponsored by Inter-Gold (the world no. 2 in the diamond market) with tie-ups with firms like GEM and Percept-Dmark. But the team is looking out for more sponsors as racing in Britain is a very expensive affair. If any of you belong to or know of any companies that sponsor motorsport or any sporting events, then the team would appreciate if you could put them through to your company's contacts.  Here  is the contact address of the team.  Right now, Amit and his team-mates are busy participating in 12-hour endurance races, on the advice of Narain Karthikeyan. Amit and Rohan (both qualified architects) like to practice at the Landmarc Citi karting course at Worli in Mumbai. They build up stamina and strength by jogging twice a day and do cardio workouts to build strength in arms, legs and necks. Their diet too is strict. But they don't mind it. Amit says, " So what if we don't get to eat burgers, not many guys our age can get to race internationally, representing their country, do they? ".  Now you see... why I was proud and excited. After all, how many guys my age can boast of friends who race internationally, representing their country?? ;-)

      In the book  urlLink Achieving Rapid Dominance , the authors Harlan Ullman and James Wade discuss a military strategy that they have termed as  Rapid Dominance . This term, as defined in the book, aims at "producing a capability that can more effectively and efficiently achieve the political or military objectives underwriting the use of force by rendering the adversary completely impotent."  The book further does some detailed analysis of the term Rapid Dominance. It says,  In Rapid Dominance, "rapid" means the ability to move quickly before an adversary can react. This notion of rapidity applies throughout the spectrum of combat from pre-conflict deployment to all stages of battle and conflict resolution.  "Dominance" means the ability to affect and dominate an adversary's will both physically and psychologically. Physical dominance includes the ability to destroy, disarm, disrupt, neutralize, and to render impotent. Psychological dominance means the ability to destroy, defeat, and neuter the will of an adversary to resist; or convince the adversary to accept our terms and aims short of using force. The target is the adversary's will, perception, and understanding. The principal mechanism for achieving this dominance is through imposing sufficient conditions of " Shock and Awe " on the adversary to convince or compel it to accept our strategic aims and military objectives. Clearly, deception, confusion, misinformation, and disinformation, perhaps in massive amounts, must be employed. The key objective of Rapid Dominance is to impose this overwhelming level of  Shock and Awe  against an adversary on an immediate or sufficiently timely basis to paralyze its will to carry on. In crude terms, Rapid Dominance would seize control of the environment and paralyze or so overload an adversary's perceptions and understanding of events that the enemy would be incapable of resistance at tactical and strategic levels. An adversary would be rendered totally impotent and vulnerable to our actions. Theoretically, the magnitude of Shock and Awe Rapid Dominance seeks to impose (in extreme cases) is the non-nuclear equivalent of the impact that the atomic weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had on the Japanese. The Japanese were prepared for suicidal resistance until both nuclear bombs were used. The impact of those weapons was sufficient to transform both the mindset of the average Japanese citizen and the outlook of the leadership through this condition of Shock and Awe. The Japanese simply could not comprehend the destructive power carried by a single airplane. This incomprehension produced a state of awe.  I haven't gone through the exercise of reproducing parts of a certain obscure military strategy book, for nothing.  George Bush is preparing to translate the theory of Shock and Awe into practice. It will be called the A-Day. A for airstrikes so lethal and devastating that they would leave Saddam's soldiers, not just incapable of retaliation but also unwilling to do so.  Just to gauge the intensity of this strategy, consider this. In the first two days of air-strikes, Pentagon plans to launch as many as 800 Cruise missiles (yeah! you heard that right!!) attargets in Iraq. That means a mind-boggling 400 missiles a day. A number that is double the number of such missiles launched in the entire 40-day campaign of the Gulf War in 1991. I've heard that Texans always think big. But this is ridiculous!!  "There will not be a safe place in Baghdad," a Pentagon official told America's CBS News after a briefing on the plan. "The sheer size of this has never been seen before, never been contemplated before."  Analysts say that the main objective is not just to disable Iraq's fighting capacity but to leave the civilian population dispirited and unwilling to support Saddam's regime. But hasn't it been tom-tommed countless number of times how the Iraqi civilian population is dis-illusioned with Saddam's rule and are not supportive of him. Then why, pray why is this necessary. On top of this Harlan Ullman, the author of the book mentioned above says, "You're sitting in Baghdad and, all of a sudden, you're the general and 30 of your division headquarters have been wiped out. You also take the city down. By that I mean you get rid of their power and water. In two, three, four, five days they are physically, emotionally and psychologically exhausted." Great!! Bush listens to such people!  Now, how much does it take for Saddam to escape all this murder and mayhem sought ot be wrought by the Americans led by a sabre-rattling Bush?? Not much. His bunkers and tactics of using look-alikes worked very well last time around and there is no reason why they may not work this time as well. Moreover The Gulf nations aren't as readily agreeable to Bush's war plans as they were last time  (even though, it begs to be pointed out that even last time, it took coercion to get them to agree for strikes against Iraq) . So, it will not be too difficult for Saddam, his sons adn his military top-brass to sneak out of Iraq before the bombing starts. And we have seen in Afghanistan how Osama and his band of terrorists managed to sneak through American dragnets time and time again  (in fact, the frustration of these failures in Afghanistan is what has led Bush to aim at a soft target like Saddam. And I mean soft target because it is very easy to get the world to hate Saddam on any given day) . So, who then is left to suffer?? The Iraqi people... as usual!!  Reposrts say that Bush is prepared to give UN inspectors another month to complete their tasks. Now, doesn't this sound magnanimous on the part of George W?? But it is interesting to note that in a Gallup poll published yesterday, only 17% of the respondents were actually in favour of going to war with Iraq. With a huge chunk of the population, as large as 83%, opposed to war, George W Bush dare not jump into the war just yet. Over the course of next month, he will give speeches like the State of Union Address that he delivered yesterday while announcing a new medicare policy. He will use each and every forum to deliver speeches that will whip up sentiments of the American public in favour of war. He'll work on the philsophy mentioned by Hermann Goering before he was sentenced to death. Goering said, "Naturally the common people don't want war: neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."  History repeats itself, they say. Not like this, please!  With war clouds looming large on his country's horizon, Uday Hussein, Saddam's son has already warned, "If they come, September 11, which they are crying over and see as a big thing, will be a real picnic for them, God willing. They will be hurt and pay a price they will never imagine. They can get much more from Iraq without resorting to the logic of force and war."  Good begets good... Bad will definitely beget more bad!  In the end, I'm totally shocked and certainly not in awe!

      Those two ladies are at it again!!   urlLink Ashwini  and  urlLink Shanti  have come up with yet another gem of an idea. Its called  Blog Mela   (or so it is called at the moment, at least) . It will be a collection of the week's best posts from the Indian blog world. And it'll be hosted by  urlLink RealWomenOnline.com  which is another of their brilliant ideas.  The ladies explain the concept of Blog Mela, thus. " You send in your best posts for the week or You send in a link to a post that you have read on someone else's blog(it has to be an Indian blog though). Your entries have to reach us by tuesday evening IST. The posts will be published on Wednesday morning EST. ".  The restriction on submissions for Blog Mela is that the submitted blogs should not be personal posts. All other topics are allowed.   urlLink Ashwini  adds a threat  (oops! ... a warning)  " If you don't send in those posts, we are still going ahead with the Mela and we are going to pick the posts ourselves at random. Let it not be said that you were not forewarned.  :-)  Well, I'll be looking forward to reading an assortment of best Indian blog-posts on Blog Mela. Who knows, perhaps one day this good-for-nothing scribbler might be published there! ;-) :-p

      Bungler left a comment on my tagboard (zonkboard) which mentioned the name of  Ken Nichols O'Keefe . To be frank, I hadn't heard of O'Keefe previously. Bungler mentioned that he was interviewed by Tim Sebastien on BBC's Hard Talk and came across as "totally commited, with integrity and belief in what he does". So, I read up on this guy who is called the  Human Shield .  Ken Nichols O'Keefe is a Gulf War veteran who joined the US Marines Corps in 1989 as a nineteen year-old eager to serve his country. In 1991, he was sent to Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. He came to know that US ammunition in the war included the use of Depleted Uranium (DU) against civilian population. This meant that even the US troops using this deadly ammo were at risk. It was George Bush Sr. using the Gulf War as a testing ground for DU-based ammo, in the process, using the 'heroes' as mere guinea pigs.  In 1999, O'Keefe renounced his US citizenship citing the reason that it was done " in shame and disgust having arrived at the logical, albeit belated, conclusion that my government was not worthy of my funding - through taxes - and certainly not my allegiance. Paying for roads and schools is one thing, paying for "Weapons of Mass Destruction" to the point of insanity and nurturing global oppression is another thing all together. No moral being can be compelled to fund war, death and murder. ".  You might say, what is it that makes this Ken Nichols O'Keefe so important. Well, he is an anti-war crusader who will go to Iraq  (alongwith other like-minded peaceniks)  and volunteer to act as human shield against the US-led attacks. He agrees that he and his fellow human shield volunteers might be maimed or killed. But that, he says, is not worse than the fate that innocent Iraqis will have to face. He points out that it is not about supporting Saddam Hussein  (which, he points out, is what US did in the past) . Instead it is about expressing solidarity for the Iraqi people and letting them know that not everybody in the Western world wants war with them. O'Keefe hits the nail right on the head when he argues that "... we will bring home to western public, the human cost of war because, unfortunately, the death and destruction faced daily by countless millions of our fellow human beings seems somehow an unfathomable abstraction unless western lives are at stake as well. ". Well said, Mr. O'Keefe!  He also quotes Gandhi, " ...peace will not come out of a clash of arms but out of justice lived and done by unarmed nations in the face of odds. ".  Sounds quite idealistic and full of rhetoric, doesn't it? Well, maybe! But this is better than the idealism touted by Bush and Blair in their claims to be the sole defenders of peace and democracy and their so-called rights to assert their will on the weaker nations of the world.  Well, what do you people think?

        Complete works of Shakespeare, all rolled into one play!  Well, that's what the Reduced Shakespeare Company has been doing for the last six years or so, in London.  The  urlLink London Theatre Guide Review  says about the play...  The Reduced Shakespeare Company, perform a collection of sketches that is sure to have the Bard turning in his grave. Shakespeare has never been lampooned with such disrespect before and no doubt never will be again. All his sonnets are reduced to eight lines, his comedies are condensed into one short sketch, and the tragedies are ridiculed unmercifully. Hamlet is abridged into a two-minute sketch that can even be performed backwards.   These days the RSC is in Mumbai and will be performing the  Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)  at the Sophia Bhabha Hall at 7:30 PM every day from 29 th  Jan 2003 to 2 nd  Feb 2003.  I would love to go and check it out!! :-)

       Dobby spells trouble for himself . Dobby, the computer-animated elf in the new Harry Potter film, could be at the centre of a court battle over his resemblance to Russian president Vladimir Putin.    Isn't the resemblance too uncanny?!!! :)  A Russian law firm is reportedly drawing up legal action against the special effects people who dreamt up Dobby, arguing that the ugly but caring elf has been modelled on Mr Putin. The Kremlin and Warner Bros, producer of Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, have declined to comment but the controversy has stirred emotions in Russia.  Potter websites and chatrooms have been inundated with angry Russian messages attacking anyone suggesting a likeness between the elf and Mr Putin.

       Ashwini  and  urlLink Shanti  have come up with  urlLink RealWomenOnline.Com .  This is the reason for the existence of this new site...   There are a lot of bloggers around and many of them write really good stuff.But we find that many women, especially Indian women, are not opening up and talking the way they would like to about non-personal issues such as Politics, Sports, etc. We feel that many of the ladies are either intimidated by others or don't want to expend too much energy into maintaining a full time blog.  This blog is designed to help out in situations like that. We want women (and men) to use our space to post their thoughts, opinions any issue that is of interest to them, as long as it is not the recipe for the day's breakfast or details of their love life (not that there is anything wrong with that).  We want women to speak out here, like there is no one listening. We know they have a lot to say when they are between friends and we want this to be a place like that - where people speak freely, and there is a free exchange of ideas.   I think this is a great idea. It is good to see Blogs being used for something positive and worthwhile. Let us have more efforts like this!! :-)

       What should you do when you are being robbed?  Well... make the robbers laugh!  At least thats what famous Albanian comedian, Sejfulla Myftari, did when armed robbers aimed Kalashnikov rifles at him with intentions of robbing him on the highway, last week.  Stepping out of the car, Myftari reached out and patted the gun and said, " Oh thanks, I haven't seen a Kalash (Kalashnikov) in ages -- will you let me hold it please ".  This amused the gangsters, who recognized the bald head and bulging eyes of the comedian, and asked him to leave quickly in his car, so that they could rob another car.  So, there you go! ... Laughter is, indeed, the best medicine!!! ;-)

      After months and months of waiting and anticipation, it's here!!  The ICC Cricket World Cup 2003 gets underway today in South Africa today with a glittering opening ceremony at Newlands in Cape Town. The actual matches will start from tomorrow, 9 th  February, with the hosts South Africa taking on the West Indies.   [shameless self-advertising]  Check out my little World Cup site  urlLink here . Its got a world cup  urlLink weblog  that I'm maintaining with my friend Abhijeet, where you'll find world cup news, team reviews, match previews, match reviews, views, etc.  (right now there isn't much, but it'll be built as the time goes by) . It also sports other features like schedule, teams, trivia, etc. However the primary reason for putting up the site was running a little world cup contest. You can check out the contest  urlLink here . You can check out the rules and if it interests you, you can then proceed to enter the contest. But I have to confess that in the absence of time and inclination, I have made the most primitive submission form ever. It relies on the user's default mail client to email the selection to a mail account from where the teams are manually entered in the competition. If you don't have a mail client configured by default, then you can email your team in the format specified on  urlLink this  address. The cut-off date/time for sending in the entries is the morning of 9 th  February, IST. So, send in your entries ASAP. Well, there aren't any prizes except the pride of being better at predictions than the others. :-P  And of course, unlike the much hyped Super Selector, this contest does not charge money for participation! ;-)  [/shameless self-advertising]   From today, I'm starting a new feature on this blog for the duration of the World Cup. There, at the top of the blog, you'll see a box with interesting World Cup tidbits, trivia and/or any sensational news.  Ok, then... let the World Cup roll!!

       urlLink  Pakistan at it again!  . When all the world was tuned in to Colin Powell's address to the UN Security Council and to the response of various countries to it, Pakistani Foreign Minister, Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, in his speech, needlessly raked up the Kashmir issue. He said,  "I cannot but reiterate that the long-term stability in the region will also require among other things, durable elimination of political and military tensions between India and Pakistan through the final settlement of the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions."   The Pakistani justification for this adventure was that Kasuri was only following Islamabad's policy of mentioning Kashmir in every speech that a Pakistani diplomat gives in the Council.  Ahem!

       I'm really excited by George Bush's latest reason for bombing Iraq: he's running out of patience. And so am I! . That's what Terry Jones  (of Monty Python fame)   urlLink says  as he goes about conspiring the destruction of his enemies... his neighbours!  Whether you endorse Bush's plan to bomb Iraq or not, this guy's take on Bush's logic does evoke a chuckle or two.  On his neighbours, he says...  They both give me queer looks, and I'm sure Mr Johnson is planning something nasty for me, but so far I haven't been able to discover what. I've been round to his place a few times to see what he's up to, but he's got everything well hidden. That's how devious he is.  Gee! does that sound familiar?!!  And why doesn't he want to go to the police, you might ask! Here's why...  Some of my neighbours say, if I've got proof, why don't I go to the police? But that's simply ridiculous. The police will say that they need evidence of a crime with which to charge my neighbours.   Quite right. The police might send an inspector or two to investigate, but nothing more than that!  Terry Jones plans pre-emptive strikes against his neighbour's family and justifies this seemingly heinous act by saying,  Mr Bush makes it clear that all he needs to know before bombing Iraq is that Saddam is a really nasty man and that he has weapons of mass destruction - even if no one can find them. I'm certain I've just as much justification for killing Mr Johnson's wife and children as Mr Bush has for bombing Iraq.  Can't argue with that logic, can we?!  His wife, though, has some reservations. But Terry Jones has an answer for her misgivings  My wife says I might be going too far but I tell her I'm simply using the same logic as the President of the United States. That shuts her up.  Who wouldn't shut up!!? After all we're talking about the logic of the most powerful man in the world!!  The final stroke from the rapier of Terry Jones is the  coup de grce   It's just as sane as what George W. Bush is proposing - and, in contrast to what he's intending, my policy will destroy only one street.  Touch!

       Has the King of Pop gone 'POP!' in his head? . One would think so, if one goes by the  urlLink "revealing and unsettling interview"  he has given to veteran journalist, Martin Bashir. Bashir spent eight months with the reclusive pop icon, making the 90-minute documentary which features the interview.  Uri Geller, a psychic, who's Michael Jackson's friend thinks that the interview showed Jackson in positive light.  "I fully trust Michael, he is a pure innocent human being, he brings so much joy into the lives of people. I think Michael was brutally honest, he was direct, he never flinched from the most difficult questions,"  Well! I think, Geller should think that way. Its natural for him to think so. He was the person who helped set up the interview. So, even if he felt otherwise, would Geller ever say that he thought the interview was a collossal failure!  In the documentary, Jackson was shown with several of the children who regularly sleep over at his California ranch, and was seen riding a Ferris wheel, driving go-carts and climbing a tree on the 3,000-acre property. Asked about his friendships with children, Jackson was candid.  "I have slept in a bed with many children including actor Macaulay Culkin and his brother Kieran. When you say `bed,' you're thinking sexual. It's not sexual, we're going to sleep. I tuck them in. ... It's very charming, it's very sweet."  I somehow smell something rotten here.  Something very repulsive!  During the eight months that Bashir spent with Michael Jackson, he travelled with the popstar on a Las Vegas shopping spree and was also there when Jackson dangled his baby, Prince Michael II from the balcony of the fourth floor of a Berlin hotel.  Jackson called the dangling incident a terrible mistake and said,  "I would never do that to my children, or any child. We were waving to thousands of fans down below and they were chanting they wanted to see my child, so I was kind enough to let them see. They got the full experience and he enjoyed it."  Egad! now would Michael Jackson, the guy who claims to adore children so completely, do something that would put the life of his own child in danger just to please his audiences??! In his right senses, he would not!  The clincher came when Bashir inquired about the numerous cosmetic changes he has undergone over the years. To this he said except for the two operations to his nose, he had not done anything,   "I am telling you the honest truth," he said. "I didn't do anything to my face. The surgeries to the nose were done because they helped me breathe better so I can hit higher notes."  I rest my case!! MJ has established his credentials as being  Wacko  Jacko!   For the information of people in the United States, the documentary will be broadcast at 8 PM EST on Thursday on ABC's "20/20".

        Disclaimer  : This is a work of fiction. All the characters in this piece are completely imaginary and fictitious. Any resemblance to any characters living or dead is purely intentional. The author has written this piece without any gender bias... ridiculing only the concept of beauty queens and contests judging beauty.    The promos had been flashing with an almost metronomic regularity. Even the most disinterested could tell you that come sunday, the most-watched news channel would bring to its the viewers, the interviews with the hottest celebs of the week... the three beauty queens!  Just the thought of seeing and hearing the " icons of Indian womanhood " sent millions of people across the nation into a tizzy. The anticipation was building up and as sunday dawned, the excitement reached a fever pitch that could only be matched by the frenzy that can exist at Eden Gardens for an India-Pak ODI.  Minutes before the appointed hour, the streets wore a deserted look and the flickering blue glow of the TV screens was visible through almost every window in the cities, towns and villages.  Then the familiar tune of the news channel sounded and everyone sat rapt in attention, eyes glued to the idiot box. What follow are exerpts from the interview. Some portions, potentially harmful to the kind reader's brain, have been deleted.   He-News-Anchor (HNA)  and  She-News-Anchor (SNA)  sport wide smiles as they welcome the three ladies into the studio. The returning ear-to-ear smiles are wider and toothier. The brilliant whiteness of the teeth cause a temporary glare in the studio. Temporarily blinded, the HNA looks into the wrong camera as he begins to speak.   HNA  : Let us welcome the three most beautiful ladies (realizes he's looking into the wrong camera... whirls around to look into the right camera as he completes the sentence)... in the country tonight!   SNA  : On the extreme right is Missed India Runner up 2... Welcome!   Missed India Runner Up 2 (Miss India 2)  : Namaste ... (bows head over hands joined in the tradition Indian greeting... then looks up and continues smiling)   SNA  : To her left is Missed India Runner Up 1... Welcome to you too!   Missed India Runner Up 1 (Miss India 1)  : Namaskar... to all my fellow Indians  (does the bowing head-and-joining-hands routine and follows it up with a wave of her right hand... which signifies "ALL my fellow Indians")   SNA  : Finally... to her left is the happiest of them all... the most beautiful woman in the country... Miss India!!   Miss India  : Hello and Namaste (She joins her hands and bows her head. The tiara, precariously perched atop her impossibly complicated hairdo slips. The right hand whizzes up to the top of her head supporting the tiara while the left hand continues to be in the "Namaste" position. She's frozen in this pose for a few seconds. Then startegically the camera pans towards the HNA.)   HNA  : Tell me ladies... how does it feel to be crowned the beauty queens? We'll start with you Miss India...   Miss India  : (coos coyly) Ooooooh! It feels as if I'm on top of the world. I just cannot believe it even now. Here... pinch me! ..... Ouch!!!   Miss India 1  : Its like God has showered his blessings on us and has been very generous. Thank God! (looks heavenwards)   Miss India 2  : I think I agree with Miss India and Miss India 1.   SNA  : What was it like up there waiting for the final announcement?   Miss India 1  : Oh I knew I was gonna win or at least come second. I was not nervous at all.   Miss India  : I was incredibly nervous. If Aman and Malaika had not announced my name in the final three I think I would have cried. I sooooo wanted to be Miss India! It has been my dream since childhood. As a little girl, every year I used to sit glued to the TV looking at those beauty queens with awe. When Sush was crowned and she made that famous gesture of surprise, I said, I want to be a beauty queen. My mummy did not believe me and my dadda choked on his tea... but I knew I was destined to be the most beautiful woman in this land of culture, tradition and mysticism... a land called India!   Miss India 2  : I think I quite agree with Miss India. I was very nervous too.   HNA  : How was the camaraderie among all you girls during the days before the final round... during the training period?   Miss India  : Uhhh... the cama... the came... uhhh   Miss India 1  : (with a look that she thought conveyed intelligence) cameradairy...   Miss India  : Ohhh... the cameradairy! ... oh yes! ... it was good!... in fact very good! Miss India 2 will tell you how good it was (knowing that Miss India 2 had half a brain more than any of the contestants).   Miss India 2  : Oh yes... we were extremely friendly and completely like a family. There were absolutely no quarrels or fights... uhhh... if you don't count the catfight that erupted when the organizers asked that dumb bimbo to play Miss India during the dress rehearsals. But then... a family has a few fights. Hai na?!   SNA  : Of course! I can understand...   Miss India  : (catching the meaning of "cameradairy" and wanting to have the last word) We were like sisters!! ... very much so! (with that she leans over to her right to hug Miss India 1 who leans to her left to receive that hug. Halfway through the act... Miss India's sash slips off her shoulder since she is leaning. Trying to save the sash from falling off, she straightens herself immediately. Miss India 1 keeps on leaning towards Miss India for the hug that never comes. The chair she is sitting on, decides to lean with her and for a moment as if in slow motion Miss India 1 is leaning at an impossible angle... until... Miss India 2 reaches out and pulls her right arm bringing Miss India 1 back to the vertical position. The nation watches.)   SNA  : Well, tell me... who were your favourite judges in the finals?   Miss India  : Ahh! Mahesh!!!! ... He's soooo cute!!   Miss India 1  : Ohh! I prefer older men... I liked Jackie. He looks so  sophisticated without his moustache!!   Miss India 2  : I think I agree with them. But I really like Yash Chopra. I like his movies. Women in his movies are sooo pretty and graceful. I would love to work with him (the extra bit of brain inside the cranium of this lady was betting on the possibility that Mr. Yash Chopra was watching the telecast. No harm in sending signals!)   HNA  : Ok then... how was the preparation for the event. The fitness programs and the grooming sessions, etc.   Miss India 1  : Ya! they were so thorough! They transformed the ugly ducklings that we were into such beauties. They ...   Miss India  : (cannot bear the word "ugly" associated with her. Interrupts!) We were all beautiful on the inside. These fitness programmes and the grooming sessions really only brought the inner beauty outside for the world to see. We needed some polishing on our rough edges. That is what the programmes before the contest gave us!   Miss India 2  : I think I agree!   SNA  : And what about the diet regimen... the food?  (Suddenly... a loud growl ripped through the studio. Confused and angry... everybody turned towards the sound technicians who shrugged and looked around innocently. Nobody realized that it was the collective growl from the stomachs of the three beauties... at the mention of "food")  The astute SNA changes track (knowing how sensitive the issue of "food" can be... especially to these anorexic ladies)...  SNA  : Tell us how you will be utilizing this year as the beauty queens?   Miss India  : We are not just beauties. We are beauties with a difference. We will make a difference! (obviously a sentence learnt by rote!)   Miss India 1  : We will be travelling across the country spreading the message of peace and helping the underprivileged kids. Our crowns make us an ambassador of peace and goodwill. We will try to spread cheer into the lives of people who need it the most. Before the year is out, we will try our level best to win glory for India at the various international beauty paegents like Miss Universe and Miss World...   HNA  : But we have seen in recent years that Indians are not getting the same awards at these international paegents...   Miss India  : Haha... don't worry. It is true that in the past few years our competitors have not been able to corner the same glory for India since Lara Dutta. But we are better. We will win. In the name of this land of culture, diversity, tradition... we will go on to win. Just you see!   Miss India 2  : I think I quite agree!   HNA  : (probing a little bit further) But there is a theory floating around that nowadays the prettiest girls are not chosen just to show that beauty is not everything while judging these contests. What do you say to that?   Miss India  : (For a moment, the eyes glare and the nostrils flare. Thousands of observant viewers swear that they saw little green horns portruding from Miss India's head. But they are not sure. It was a fleeting glimpse.) Completely rubbish!! Look at me... Don't I look pretty?!!   Miss India 1  : Look at me too!!   Miss India 2  : I think I agree! Complete rubbish!   SNA  : (Astute as ever) That's all we have time for today on this special beauty edition of the programme. We thank the lovely threesome for sharing their thoughts with us. Thank you ladies!! ... And now... we will be back after a very short commercial break!  At the sound of the word "break", the spell that held millions in thrall, is broken. Life in India returns to normal. Channels are changed... dinners eaten... the streets start buzzing again. Life goes on as usual.

       Investigators say hole in aluminum wrecked the Shuttle . The panel investigating the loss of the space shuttle Columbia said that a hole developed in its aluminum skin, allowing superheated gas to flow into the left wing and causing the ship's destruction.  NASA also released a highly detailed map showing for the first time that the Columbia's sensors began detecting subtle signs of trouble when the craft was still above the Pacific Ocean, 400 miles off the coast of Sonoma County in Northern California.  The new map, combined with the board's finding that a hole was burning through spacecraft's skin, suggested that observations of glowing pieces falling away from the shuttle over California carry significant clues to the ultimate cause of the disaster. It could mean that the catastrophic series of failures began almost the moment the Columbia re-entered the atmosphere, lending credence to theories that its exterior had been damaged earlier  perhaps by a piece of foam insulation that fell off during launching, perhaps by space debris or by some other phenomenon like a storm in space.

        urlLink Hacking the hacker!   Kevin Mitnick, hacker  par excellence , recently came out of federal probation and started a new security consulting company called,  urlLink Defensive Thinking . Twice in the last two weeks, hackers/vandals have managed to hack into the website of Mitnick's company.  The latest breach was by a hacker from Texas who said he hacked into Mitnick's site because he wanted to be hired as Mitnick's security officer.  In the earlier breach, a hacker calling themselves Bugbear simply added a page to the website saying; "welcome back to freedom mr.kevin ;)".   In both instances, the hackers took advantage of a flaw in Microsoft's popular Internet Information Server (IIS) to break into the web server.  Golly!! hearing this... I am wondering how many customers  urlLink Defensive Thinking  is going to get!!

      Here's a good balanced view of this whole US-Iraq thing.   Present at...What?  an editorial in  urlLink The New York Times  by  urlLink Thomas L. Friedman   (Registration required)   Well, it leans a little towards war... but neverthless, presents a good case for the US to hold back its attacking instincts till a global coalition is formed.  That means the Bush hawks need to realize they cannot achieve their ultimate aim of disarming and transforming Iraq without maximum international legitimacy. And the Euro-doves need to realize they cannot achieve their aims of a peaceful solution in Iraq and preserving the U.N. and the whole multilateral order without a credible threat of force against Saddam Hussein.  That's quite right! The "unilateral war" that the US seeks to start against Iraq will be disastrous for the world order without the support and consent of the other countries... even though US is the world's greatest and the only superpower.  The first rule of any Iraq invasion is the pottery store rule: You break it, you own it. We break Iraq, we own Iraq  and we own the primary responsibility for rebuilding a country of 23 million people that has more in common with Yugoslavia than with any other Arab nation.  I like the pottery store rule! :-)  We don't need a broad coalition to break Iraq. We can do that ourselves. But we do need a broad coalition to rebuild Iraq, so that the American taxpayer and Army do not have to bear that full burden or be exposed alone at the heart of the Arab-Muslim world. President Bush, if he alienates the allies from going to war  the part we can do alone  is depriving himself of allies for the peace  the part where we'll need all the friends we can get.    We need a compromise. We need to say to the French, Russians and Chinese that we'll stand down for a few more weeks and give Saddam one last chance to comply with the U.N. disarmament demands  provided they agree now that if Saddam does not fully comply they will have the U.N. authorize the use of force.    If war proves inevitable, it must be seen as the product of an international decision, not an American whim.  This last point is very critical... from an international point of view. Then Friedman rounds off his editorial by giving a very valid argument, which may sound arrogant, but is very important if the US wants to prevent another Vietnam.  Because there is no war we can't win by ourselves, but there is no nation we can rebuild by ourselves  especially Iraq.  We need more such balanced views. Neither the hawkish "war cries" nor the pacifist "make love not war" views will help. As always... the middle path is always the best. Take it America... the world and more importantly, Iraq, will be grateful to you for doing so!

      Since cricket is going to be the flavour of the coming month (and some more), it makes sense to talk about it... I guess!  Francois Gautier has written a column on  urlLink Rediff , titled  urlLink Cricket, the Destroyer  in which he derides the sport of cricket in the Indian context. I do not quite agree with some of the arguments he has presented.   Yet, both India and Pakistan should consider this: cricket is a colonial game, a leftover of the British Empire. Cricket was played in the 19th century by rich, idle maharajas and upper class Indians, who wanted to look more British than the British and aped the English in whatever they did, whether it was hunting tigers, owning a Rolls Royce, or playing the 'gentleman's game.'  A very very common argument against cricket. Agreed!... that cricket is a colonial leftover that the Indians have taken to like fish to water. But then so is our parliamentary democracy! It is an exact carbon copy of the British parliamentary system. Why then are we still using it. Why not go in for the Presidential form of democracy just to rid ourselves of this colonial leftover. Or better still, lets devise a totally new system of democracy that'll make us proud to be Indians... our very own system that isn't inspired from the one that was  (and still is!)  practised by upper class Britishers who spend all their time having tea and biscuits, when they are not debating trivial issues in the confines of the parliament building.   It was never a sport for the masses. It is a pity that after Independence, both the governments of India and Pakistan encouraged cricket. This South Asian obsession with cricket has had catastrophic consequences on the national psyche of these countries.  Ohh! in fact I thought the effect of cricket was just the opposite. Why does Mr. Gautier think cricket is an elitist game and not for the masses?! In fact, cricket is and always has been a spectator sport. It may not be just 90 minutes long as soccer or 70 minutes long as hockey... but it has always attracted spectators, whether it has been played on green English meadows or in emotional cauldrons like Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Lets see... the quintessentially Indian game/sport of chess is as elitist as it gets.    There is unfortunately a conspiracy between the Government of India and the big business corporations to inflate the importance of cricket because they make so much money out of it. The amount spent by multinationals and national companies, for instance, on the pre-publicity for the present cricket World Cup is nothing short of shameful in a country where basic necessities such as drinking water are badly lacking.  C'mon... I'm not even gonna comment on this naive argument. When you have no other argument to present... give the conspiracy angle to buttress your argument.    It is equally disgraceful players, however talented they are, endorse any product, from soft drinks to cars, from electronics to foreign credit cards. As sportsmen of international standing, they should show some sense of balance in the choice of products they associate their image with. Crores of rupees are spent on artificial, tasteless ads for Coca-Cola and Pepsi that not only incarnate American imperialism but also lead to obesity and chemical imbalance in the body. If only the profits of multinationals would benefit poor Indians, but they mostly go in the pockets of American multinationals and a few rich Indians.  Haha! ... the Left speaketh!! The use of socialist comments like these never fails to generate sympathy among the "patriotic" audiences.    Cricket stifles all other sports. Because of the sponsorship and advertisement solely focused on cricket, much more deserving and physically harder sports, such as track and field are neglected and other athletes get very little sponsorship and media attention. As a direct result, India's world position in sports, considering that there are a billion Indians, is abysmal and nothing short of disgraceful.  I simply don't subscribe to this..."Cricket kills other sports" viewpoint. Where was the hype and craze for cricket before that magic 1983 triumph in England?!! It existed in India just as any other sport... well, probably slightly more popular than other sports. Hockey was the apple of everyone's eyes... with the Indian team being the  tour de force  of world hockey. That triumph of 1983 changed everything. Cricket came into focus as the sport in which Indians could actually be world-beaters. Also, the Indian dominance in international hockey scene was on the wane. All this led to crowning of cricket as the  numero uno  sport in the country. After the opening up of the Indian economy in the early 1990's, big money started coming into cricket as the corporates looking to sponsor sports naturally plumped for cricket which was the most popular sport. Added to this was the rise of players like Sachin Tendulkar whose individual talents shone like beacons in game that was essentially a team-sport. Endorsing of products by stars, be it movie stars or sports stars, is a global phenomenon and does not have anything to do with aping America.    It is also high time that sports be taken off the hands of politicians and bureaucrats, who have shamelessly exploited it for selfish purposes and left it in the mire it is now.  On this point, I agree 100% with Mr. Gautier. Though, it begs to be mentioned that a certain percentage of politicians and businessmen in the sports-governing bodies, is a good thing too.  Then curiously... Mr. Gautier gets confused about what he is supposed to write and starts talking about things like " saffronisation of education ", meditation,  pranayam  and religion. Gee!! ... and I thought he was talking about cricket being a bad thing for India!    It is high time the Indian government enforces a limitation on the number of international cricket matches played abroad and starts focusing a little more on other sports. India lags 30 years behind China and 50 years behind the West in most sports.  Well! what does restricting the number of matches played in a year have anything to do with the upliftment of other sports?!! Confusion reigns supreme!! And finally... he hurriedly rounds of his column saying  Shame on you cricket, the destroyer.  Hmmm... what can I say!  By the way... a couple of days back, I heard an interview of ace commentator Harsha Bhogle. He said, " As long as India continues to be an unhappy nation, cricket will thrive. The day that Indians are a happy people, cricket will lose its raison d'etre ."  Think about it!

        The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive....

      In an amusing and succinct  urlLink essay  about "habits and needs of a little-understood group", Johnathan Rauch talks about the finer points of being an introvert. And, being one, I quite agree to what he says.    Science has learned a good deal in recent years about the habits and requirements of introverts. It has even learned, by means of brain scans, that introverts process information differently from other people (I am not making this up). If you are behind the curve on this important matter, be reassured that you are not alone. Introverts may be common, but they are also among the most misunderstood and aggrieved groups in America, possibly the world.     Introverts are not necessarily shy. Shy people are anxious or frightened or self-excoriating in social settings; introverts generally are not. Introverts are also not misanthropic, though some of us do go along with Sartre as far as to say "Hell is other people at breakfast." Rather, introverts are people who find other people tiring.  Extroverts are energized by people, and wilt or fade when alone. They often seem bored by themselves, in both senses of the expression. Leave an extrovert alone for two minutes and he will reach for his cell phone. In contrast, after an hour or two of being socially "on," we introverts need to turn off and recharge. My own formula is roughly two hours alone for every hour of socializing. This isn't antisocial. It isn't a sign of depression. It does not call for medication. For introverts, to be alone with our thoughts is as restorative as sleeping, as nourishing as eating. Our motto: "I'm okay, you're okayin small doses."   So very true, I say! :-)  This gets better. Read on...  Extroverts are easy for introverts to understand, because extroverts spend so much of their time working out who they are in voluble, and frequently inescapable, interaction with other people. They are as inscrutable as puppy dogs. But the street does not run both ways. Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion. They assume that company, especially their own, is always welcome. They cannot imagine why someone would need to be alone; indeed, they often take umbrage at the suggestion.    With their endless appetite for talk and attention, extroverts also dominate social life, so they tend to set expectations. In our extrovertist society, being outgoing is considered normal and therefore desirable, a mark of happiness, confidence, leadership. Extroverts are seen as bighearted, vibrant, warm, empathic. "People person" is a compliment. Introverts are described with words like "guarded," "loner," "reserved," "taciturn," "self-contained," "private"narrow, ungenerous words, words that suggest emotional parsimony and smallness of personality. Female introverts, I suspect, must suffer especially.  He ends with a three-point advice on how to deal with the introvert in your life...  First, recognize that it's not a choice. It's not a lifestyle. It's an orientation.  Second, when you see an introvert lost in thought, don't say "What's the matter?" or "Are you all right?"  Third, don't say anything else, either.  Well, not quite Carl Jung or Sigmund Freud... but makes for fun reading anyways! ;-)

       Are you pro-war or anti-war or are you Neal Pollack?!  In an absolutely irreverent and anti-idiotarian and funny  urlLink article , Neal Pollack pokes and ribs the pro and anti war folks in equal measure. With all the serious  (and sometimes quite hammy!) stuff being written in both camps, this article manages to evoke a smile and even an occasional chuckle!  I quote some of the points from the article...  My annoyance has been stewing for a while. It peaked with the emergence of Poets Against the War, an overhyped coalition of usual suspects led by Seattle poet and small-press publisher Sam Hamill. Last week Mr. Hamill, with a maximum amount of self-righteous pomposity, staged readings across the country. My first reaction, upon hearing about the protest readings, was, "Oh, no. The poets are against the war. Whatever are we going to do?"    Post-September 11 writing felt like the nation's collective diary. Even at its worst, it was somehow cathartic and sweet, even necessary. But this war-to-be with Iraq has unleashed a torrent of pompous fulmination--perhaps not as great in volume as after September 11, but twice as pretentious and grating.  Neal first targets the pro-war group...  Now let's see what's up over at the New Yorker. I've just selected an issue at random from the pile on my coffee table. Oh, here's this week's Hendrik Hertzberg editorial about Important Matters That We Face: "A little more time, especially if it comes with a Security Council resolution unambiguously authorizing force if Iraq does not unambiguously disarm, would mitigate the damage to allied unity, lessen the (largely self-created) isolation of the United States, and... "  I'm sorry, Rick. Were you saying something?  LOL!!... could anyone make out what this Hendrik Hertzberg wants to communicate?? ;-)  Then comes the turn of the anti-war peaceniks...  With the pro-war writers, sometimes you get the sense that they're not only trying to influence their readers but trying to persuade themselves as well. Except in extreme cases, a little doubt crawls around the edges. But that's not the case with antiwar writers, who just exude smug certainty as they preach to their already-converted audience. They know the secret evil heart of U.S. imperialism, and they're going to tell us all about it, for pages and pages.  Then this one is plain hilarious...  Meanwhile, in turncoat land, Dan Savage, generally liberal sex-advice columnist and medium-market weekly newspaper editor, writes pieces in favor of the war so persuasive that Rush Limbaugh reads them on the air. Hooray, Dan! You support the president! Now shut up and go test-drive that three-pronged dildo for your next column. I wouldn't read a sex-advice column by, say, E. J. Dionne, and I don't want to read a political article by you.   And then... Pollack ends his article with a fervent plea!  So to all of us who deem ourselves writers in this time of war, I can only say, in the immortal words of the great folk singer Kelly Osbourne:   Shut up!

       Ever heard of a soundless concert that stirs your emotions?! . A bizzare experiment in soundless music has revealed how people's emotions are affected by noises they cannot hear.  Scientists have begun analysing the responses of 250 people who took part in the study into the effects of infrasound, carried out at Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral last September.  They showed the audience's emotions intensified as the inaudible sound vibrations, too low for the human ear to perceive, were blasted out during a 50-minute piano recital.  Those feeling uncomfortable when the concert began, found their mood turning to anger.  Others, who had felt happy, started to notice sensations of joy.  Some physical affects were also experienced, including tingling in the back of the neck and a strange feeling in the stomach.  Read more about it  urlLink here   Music without any sound!!...

According to a news  urlLink article  on  urlLink Rediff , among the 82 countries that were assessed by the World Economic Forum for the " state of their information technology system and its effects on economic growth and productivity ", India was placed at the 37th position. Not bad! ... especially considering the huge size of the country and the low levels of telecom and PC penetration.  Finland was ranked at the first place because of the high technology usage by its citizens, businesses and the government. It was followed by United States and Singapore.  Among other significant positions, Germany is in the 10th spot, Israel in the 12th spot and Estonia is in the 24th place. The African nation of Tunisia is ranked higher than India at the 37th place!  And for all the brouhaha over the Chinese threat to India in the IT sector, China is ranked much lower than India at the 43rd position!

      CNN  urlLink reports  that a hacker has gained access to as many as 2.2 million Visa and MasterCard accounts. It says that the two companies announced that the hacker breached the security system of a company that processes credit card transactions on behalf of merchants, Visa and MasterCard.  However it seems none of the accounts have been fraudulently used so far. In any case, both card companies have zero-liability policies, which protect cardholders from being held responsible for unauthorized or fraudulent charges.  The culprit however has still not been identified.

       urlLink Bollywood told to stub it out    The World Health Organisation has accused the Bollywood film industry of encouraging teenagers to smoke by increasing the amount of smoking shown on screen.  In a report to be released on Tuesday in Geneva, the organisation also said it used to be mostly bad guys who smoked. But now more than half of Bollywood heroes were also shown lighting up in films.  The United Nations' health body studied Bollywood films released in the last 10 years.  Well... I guess this is all that United Nations will continue doing, once its existence is rendered redundant by certain member countries.  It is estimated that 15 million people a day watch Bollywood films, either at the cinema or on television. Many see the stars as a leading cultural influence.     The health organisation is now calling on Bollywood to end on-screen smoking altogether.  Gee! ... and they say Shiv Sena talks too much about cultural influence/invasion, banning and stuff like that!!  But I agree with one thing... down with smoking!! ... at least in public places!

       Every coin has two sides, they say!  Well, even if that is true... this is ridiculous!  My friend sent me these links today. The news item in question is not a breaking news story. On the contrary, its an old news.  On Sunday, 12th January 2003, a fire broke out in the premises of National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) in Pune. This news item was reported widely in all kinds of media... print, online, broadcast.   urlLink Rediff  reported it too. Here's Rediff's version of the incident. Click  urlLink here .  Our next door neighbours seem to be pretty interested in every single incident in India, that they can proceed to dismantle and twist according to their own whims and fancies. Have a look at  urlLink this . It's a report of the same fire that had erupted in NCL in Pune on 12th January.  Here are some of the outrageous things that appear in that Paki report...  This facility is used by India to build outlawed biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction.  Shudder! Shudder!! ... after Saddam, its gonna be Vajpayee, is it?!!  The fire which engulfed the Organic Technical branch of NCL was brought under control by firefighters after frantic efforts.  Hehe!... notice the subtle sarcasm...  frantic efforts ! :-))  However, it surprised the world by confessing to maintaining stocks of undeclared chemical biological weapons which she has undertaken to destroy by April 26, 2007.  When was this?!!... I missed this news!! :-P   According to well informed sources, though the CWC prohibits preparation, storage and trade in chemical weapons, India has reportedly continued with the clandestine research and is secretly maintaining stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons in its satellite state, Bhutan, which surprisingly is not a signatory to the CWC. Thus circumventing the controls of United Nations and stockpiling biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction.   Oooh!! brilliant reporting! My compliments to the author of this piece!!  So... what do you people think??

       Now, this is taking a turn for the comical!  On the eve of a crucial Pool A match against Zimbabwe, the Pakistani players are at blows among themselves instead of sitting down to chalk out a strategy for the do-or-die match.  The  urlLink incident , which occurred during a football match, was witnessed by reporters and photographers.  Tempers flared when Younis Khan challenged Inzamam-ul-Haq for the ball. The pair squared up and when team mate Saeed Anwar tried to defuse the situation he was pushed to the ground by Inzamam.  Skipper Waqar Younis said: "It's nothing new. We always have this problem when we play soccer."  Take a hint mate!... Stick to cricket!! ;-)  It may be noted that the short-tempered Inzamam-ul-Haq is known to throw his weight around at the slightest provocation. In a India-Pak match, for the Sahara Cup, at Toronto, a few years back, he jumped over the advertising boards on the boundary and attacked a heckling spectator with a cricket bat.

       [Update]    The latest shocking news is that 6 bombs have been found and defused at New Delhi Railway Station  . Read more  urlLink here .  [/Update]    Another blast rocks Mumbai!!  It's almost as if the peace in Mumbai is destined to be punctuated by a bomb blast every couple of months. At around 8:40 PM IST, a bomb blast occured in a crowded Karjat bound local train at the Mulund railway station in Mumbai.  As I am sitting at home listening to the continuous news coverage of this unfortunate event on TV, the body count is rising steadily. When I reached home less than an hour back, the news channels reported that 6 people had been killed. Right now, as I write this post, the count has gone up to 10. Added to this are around 65 people who are injured, some seriously. You can read more about it  urlLink here .  This blast comes only one day after the 10th anniversary of the blasts that rocked Mumbai leaving 260 people dead.  Moreover, it comes less than three months after the bomb that blasted in a public transport bus in Ghatkopar in Mumbai... and the one that rocked a crowded street in Vile Parle in January this year.  The latest blast looks to have been caused by a crude bomb planted in the first class ladies compartment of the local train. As a result, most of the casualties have been ladies.  Authorities have confirmed that this was a planned terrorist attack and not an accidental explosion.  Three bomb blasts in three months in Mumbai. All of them in non-strategic locations. All of them in places that the people have come to trust. Bus, market and train. All of these point to a planned attack on the psyche of the Mumbaikar... aimed at creating panic and distrust.  The death toll in the blast has risen to 12.    The latest news is that another bomb has been found in Mumbai  . This bomb was found in a BEST bus near IIT Mumbai. Details are not known yet.

       Do we live in a Doughnut shaped Universe?  This new  urlLink study  [NY Times registration required]  seems to suggest so.  Long ago in the dawn of the computer age, college students often whiled away the nights playing a computer game called Spacewar. It consisted of two rocket ships attempting to blast each other out of the sky with torpedoes while trying to avoid falling into a star at the center of the screen.  Although cartoonish in appearance, the game was amazingly faithful to the laws of physics, complete with a gravitational field that affected both the torpedoes and the rockets. Only one feature seemed outlandish: a ship that drifted off the edge of the screen would reappear on the opposite side.  Real space couldn't work that way.  Or could it?     That is the picture of space, some cosmologists say, that has been suggested by a new detailed map of the early universe. Their analysis of this map has now provided a series of hints  though only hints  that the universe may have a more complicated shape than astronomers presumed.  Rather than being infinite in all directions, as the most fashionable theory suggests, the universe could be radically smaller in one direction than the others. As a result it may be even be shaped like a doughnut.  "There's a hint in the data that if you traveled far and fast in the direction of the constellation Virgo, you'd return to Earth from the opposite direction," said Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania.  Hmmm!! Interesting, don't you think!

Over last few weeks, I've been following with interest the storm that has been raised over the installation of Swatantryaveer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar's portrait in the Central Hall of the Parliament. It's as if the Government has put up the portrait of Satan himself. It's almost childish... the arguments put forth by Savarkar's detractors. Half of them do not know the facts and most of them, I'm sure, do not even know Savarkar's full name... leave alone his ideology. Reading the various articles penned by the pro and anti Savarkar columnists and "intellectuals", I can't help but feel that the attacks and the defense are oriented at one or two specific instances from Savarkar's eventful life  i.e.  his pro-Hindu ideology, his much-maligned act of seeking forgiveness for getting himself released from the notorious Cellular Jail at Andaman and his two-nation theory.  We have seen the most vociferous opposition coming from the Communists. The entire Left abstained from attending the portrait unveiling ceremony. Picking up the refrain, the Congress started opposing the installation of the portrait as well. Seeing the opposition up in arms, the Government could not keep quiet and launched a counter attack defending its decision. Thus started the war of words which has since then spilled out of the Parliament halls and into the media, tarnishing the name of a grossly misunderstood figure from India's history. To top it all, I'm amazed at the reaction of the public. They have unleashed a vitriolic campaign comparing Savarkar to Hitler... Please!!... excuse me while I barf!  Let us look at facts... and only facts!  Any decision to install a portrait in the Central Hall of the Parliament can never be a unilateral decision by the government in power. It's a decision taken by a committee which looks into the merits and demerits of such an action and the contributions made by the historical figure in question. Such a committee was formed this time as well... to decide on installing Savarkar's portrait. And it included Pranab Mukherji from the Congress and... hold your breath... Comrade Indrajit Gupta, veteran Communist Parliamentarian. The committee's decision to install Savarkar's portrait was unanimous. Where, then, did the seed of opposition germinate??  Swatantryaveer Savarkar has a sprawling memorial dedicated to him in Mumbai. It's a beautiful but simple  structure with a huge statue of Savarkar on a large terrace overlooking the Dadar Chowpatty at Shivaji Park. It was built on the recommendation of a committee headed by Jayantrao Tilak  (a Congress leader and the grandson of Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak) . Another Congress leader, Yashwantrao Chavan was the member of that Committee too. And the funds for the memorial came partly from the personal account of none other than the  then  PM, late Indira Gandhi. And now... the same Congress headed by the  Desh ki bahu  Sonia Gandhi is staunchly opposing Savarkar!  One of the biggest argument against Swatantryaveer Savarkar is that he advocated the two-nation theory. This is crap. As a proponent of Hindutva, Savarkar always advocated the concept of  Akhand Bharat  rather than work towards partitioning India on communal lines. Savarkar's Hindu Mahasabha had rejected the British Cabinet Mission Plan of May 1946 which proposed that provinces (formed on the basis of communal/religious majority) would have their own constitutions. It was Jinnah's acceptance of this pan that led to fruitless discussions and consequently, scrapping of that plan. The only option left for the British government was to transfer power to a partitioned India. This plan was accepted by both, the Congress as well as Jinnah. There are numerous examples where Savarkar agreed to side with the Congress on the condition that it would ensure the unity and integrity of the Indian nation.  Arvind Lavakare's  column  on  Rediff , titled " Hitler, Vatican and Gandhi " only just begins to stir the surface of the controversial parts of the freedom struggle. It highlights the role that Gandhiji played in the partition of India while showing clearly how Savarkar's two-nation statement was not the cause of the partition of India. And the best thing about the column is that Mr. Lavakare quotes history texts and documents to support his claims rather than shooting his mouth off.  The Communists have no right to even begin to accuse Savarkar of being a proponent of the two-nation theory. Coomunists have always advocated until recently that India is a confederation of nationalities. They have advocated, as recently as the sixties, that provinces like Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, etc. are not states or provinces but nationalities which are a part of the Indian confederation. We have seen how this kind of communist confederation has crumbled into nothingness when USSR broke up. If Savarkar is being accused of promoting two nations, Communists have been guilty of advocating a divisive, multi-nation theory... and that too a good twenty years after the independence. Clearly a case of pot calling the kettle black.  Swatantryaveer Savarkar has been accused of asking for pardon instead of undergoing an imprisonment. History is replete with examples of revolutionaries asking pardon and forgiveness from the powers that imprisoned them. The great Italian nationalist  (Soniaji, please note!)  Giuseppe Mazzini did the same thing. So did Yogi Arvind, who was a staunch revolutionary before running away from the British and seeking asylum in the French controlled Pondicherry before giving up his ways to become a spiritual leader.  Revolutionaries like Savarkar or pacifists like Gandhi, were working for a common cause, freedom for India. Armed struggle alone could not have achieved the objective. Neither could Gandhiji's method of non-violence and submission persuade the British to eave the country. Both kinds of freedom fighters have their place in history and seeing one through the glasses of the other will only result in unnecessary hatred and misunderstanding.

       urlLink CDMA Pushed on Postwar Iraq   [link via  urlLink Slashdot ]   A coalition is underfoot in the U.S. Congress to replace European with American cell phone technology in Iraq as soon as the conflict is over and the country rebuilds. ...  The current reconstruction plan involves using U.S. funds to install a European-based wireless technology known as GSM (define) for a new Iraqi cell phone system. Issa's bill (HR 1441) would give preference to American companies, including QUALCOMM.  "If European GSM technology is deployed in Iraq, much of the equipment used to build the cell phone system would be manufactured in France, Germany, and elsewhere in western and northern Europe. Furthermore, royalties paid on the technology would flow to French and European sources, not U.S. patent holders," Issa said in his letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and USAID Administrator, Ambassador Wendy Chamberlain.  Idiots!!! Now, this coupled with the now-infamous  urlLink Halliburton contract , seriously undermines the US claims that this war is simply about liberating Iraq or dethroning the tyrant Saddam.  Ohh! and I don't think only the Americans are to blame for this. What do you say to Tony Blair who rushed to US when it became apparent that the British were left in the lurch when it came to the post-war reconstruction contracts which the US companies are winning without even going through a formal bidding process!

       urlLink Who armed Iraq?   [link via  urlLink Metafilter ]   Iraq's Weapons Declaration underscores a tragic irony: The United States, the world's leading arms supplier, is taking the world to war to stop arms proliferation in the very country to which it shipped chemicals, biological seed stock and weapons for more than 10 years.  According to the December declaration, treated with much derision from the Bush administration, U.S. and Western companies played a key role in building Hussein's war machine. The 1,200-page document contains a list of Western corporations and countries -- as well as individuals -- that exported chemical and biological materials to Iraq in the past two decades.  Embarrassed, no doubt, by revelations of their own complicity in Mideast arms proliferation, the U.S.-led Security Council censored the entire dossier, deleting more than 100 names of companies and groups that profited from Iraq's crimes and aggression. The censorship came too late, however. The long list -- including names of large U.S. corporations -- Dupont, Hewlett-Packard, and Honeywell -- was leaked to a German daily, Die Tageszeitung. Despite the Security Council coverup, the truth came out.  A German company, for example, exported 1,000 ignition systems for Styx and Scud missiles capable of carrying biological and nuclear warheads.   Why were Bush and Powell so sure that Iraq possessed WMDs, even despite failing to produce hard evidence to corroborate their claims? Well... they knew, because they sold those weapons and launching capabilities to Saddam.  George Orwell's brilliant essay on empire and nationalism applies directly to the mendacity of the Bush administration:  "Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them. There is almost no kind of outrage -- torture, imprisonment without trial, assassination, the bombing of civilians -- which does not change its moral color when it is committed by 'our' side. . . . The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them."  Almost prophetic, aren't those Orwellian words?!

      I've quite erratic lately as far as this blog is concerned. Most of my posts have been links to some stories off the Net. The reason for this has been the cricket World Cup that was going on for over a month. I've been busy watching, eating, drinking, sleeping and  urlLink blogging  cricket.  In addition to  urlLink blogging  about the World Cup, I was also running a  urlLink contest  on my  urlLink world cup site . With my friend Abhijeet giving invaluable help all along, both of us managed to keep the blog and the contest running up-to-date throughout the duration of the World Cup. 33 teams took part in the contest. Now that the world cup is over... here are the  urlLink final standings . Congratulations to  Dipali  for winning the contest!! She managed to pip Faizan at the post by the slimmest of margins. And as Abhijeet  urlLink explains , it was just a matter of one ball in the final match and it would've been Faizan who won the contest.  Well anyways, I think I'll be much more regular with my blogging on thi blog from now on. And I have lot to blog about. The war is a constant source of material which prompts a reaction, one way or the other.  Stick around folks... we're just getting started!! :-)

       urlLink Tornadoes to drop 'concrete bombs'   After using the ultimate in hi-technology in the form of accurate, precision-guided missiles, the Allies are now turning to another piece of innovation in a bid to reduce civilian deaths resulting from explosions due to the bombs and missile.  But now the crews operating over Iraq from the Ali Al Salem airbase in northern Kuwait are about to go to the opposite extreme and use "inert bombs". These are basically blocks of concrete shaped as bombs and painted blue to identify them as non-explosive if they are discovered still intact after the war. But they will be laser-guided 1,000lb blocks of concrete, capable of destroying a tank or artillery piece, but without causing a devastating explosion that would put civilians at risk and shatter surrounding buildings.

       urlLink A legend turns 90    In the company of generals, children, politicians, journalists and illustrious members of the global Parsi community and with traditional Zoroastrian rituals, Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw, India's first and only living field marshal, celebrated his 90th birthday in New Delhi on Thursday.  Manekshaw, his legendary wit and charm intact, cut his birthday cake with a silver khukri, the favourite dagger of the legendary Gurkha soldiers, as the large gathering sang Happy Birthday to You.  Yesterday, I was watching some footage of this birthday party on TV and I was struck by how active and sprightly FM (retd.)  Sam Manekshaw  (Sam Bahadur to his troops)  looked and acted, even at the age of 90. He looked dapper in a smart suit and he answered questions with enthusiasm.  One journalist asked him about his views on the war. " War?! What war are you talking about??!... I don't know of any war! ", he shot back almost immediately, " I'm a peace-loving man. The only fighting I did was with my wife. And she died two years ago! ".  We could really do with men like him in the Army and politics right now. Belated Birthday Wishes to you, Sam!!

       Attention citizens of Mumbai!  A non-governmental organization ( NGO ),  urlLink Praja  has just launched an Online Complaint Management System ( OCMS ) in close association with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( BMC ). OCMS was launched at the BMC headquarters yesterday (3 April 2003) by Mumbai's mayor, Mahadeo Deole and B G Deshmukh, the chairman of the board of trustees of PRAJA foundation   According to the press release by PRAJA,   The Online Complaint Monitoring System (OCMS) is designed to enable citizens of Mumbai register complaints and receive information on the complaint status quickly and easily, without the need to visit or call the Brihan-Mumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) ward offices at restricted timings. All you need to do is to go to www.praja.org and fill in a simple form with the complaint details. On submission, you will be given a unique complaint tracking number, which helps you check the status of your complaint on the internet - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Anonymous complaints are accepted.  What if you don't have connectivity to the internet? Not to worry, the OCMS is a cohesive system. Complaints filed from any source - the net, phone calls and letters to the BMC - will be entered into the OCMS database. The BMC has a 24/7 complaint hotline telephone "1916." And, regardless from where the complaint is fed into the system, you will get a similar complaint tracking number.   Citizens can post their civic complaints online through the OCMS on PRAJA's website. Be it water shortage, encroachment, garbage pile-up or any other civic concern, people of Mumbai no longer will need to run to their area's municipal office to lodge a complaint. They can post their complaint through OCMS and be assured that it will be taken care of soon. A complaint officer in each of the 24 wards of BMC will monitor the complaints for his/her area and forward the complaints to the concerned departments in the BMC. If a particular complaint is not resolved within a stipulated time-frame, then it gets routed to a higher official, thus ensuring redressal. This stipulated time-frame is decided in a  urlLink Citizen's Charter , a comprehensive document prepared jointly by the BMC and PRAJA.  e.g.  the Charter sets a time-frame of 24 hours for the redressal of issues like "Overflowing drains or manholes" or "Garbage not lifted from authorised collection spot".  The OCMS is also a complaint monitoring system. Higher officials in BMC can keep track and monitor the progress of grievance redressal by accessing the system.  Some salient features of OCMS...  (taken from the PRAJA press release)  1. First of its kind anywhere in the world. 2. All the complaints - from whichever source - will be put in one cohesive system, making it easier to respond, maintain, and evaluate. 3. Each complaint will have a unique tracking number. The complainant can at any time of day or night check the status of the complaint online. 4. If the complaint is not heeded, it will be escalated to the higher officer automatically - up to the Municipal Commissioner. There is no human involvement in this process and it removes the scope for delays in dealing with citizens' complaints. 5. It will revolutionize the use of Information Technology in governance. E-governance is much more that simply computerization of government offices and better communications. This is an interactive system. 6. The OCMS will bring about transparency in governance thus improving governance tremendously. 7. For the first time an NGO is partnering the government in such an initiative.  I think OCMS is an excellent step towards creating an accountable and functional civic administration. BMC and PRAJA have taken the first step. Now it is upto the citizens of Mumbai to step forward and make this effort a success.  Finally... an applause for the people behind PRAJA for their wonderful initiative.

       urlLink US forces use Daisy Cutters    As American forces encounter stiffer resistance on the road to Baghdad, military commanders say they have been authorised to use still greater firepower.   And by greater firepower, they mean  Daisy Cutters . These 15,000 pound hulks are quite dumb. They don't have any precision-guided technology. They're just slid off the ramp from the aircraft flying around 6,000 feet or higher and they use parachutes to float towards their target. Once they explode, an area of several hundred yards is completely obliterated.  If the Cruise missiles are as precise as a surgeon's scalpel, the Daisy Cutters are as subtle as an ironsmith's hammer-blow.

       urlLink Saddam Eyes Endgame, Gathers in His Elite Forces    The Iraq war is resolving itself into a battle of wits whose lines are deliberately blurred by the bravado, ambiguous maneuvers and half-truths propagated by both sides. The protagonists are US General Tommy Franks and Saddam Hussein. The score on Day 12 of the war is even. DEBKAfiles intelligence sources and military analysts stress that both are perfectly aware that the war will end in an American battlefield victory. With an eye on the endgame, the two are maneuvering over its cost.  Exactly!! There are no two ways about the fact that the Coalition forces are going to win this war. It is inconceivable that the combined might of US and UK air-force, army, navy and dolphins could be defeated by the Iraqis. The only thing that matters for both the sides is the cost of war. Franks goal is a victory with the lowest number of American casualties, whereas Saddam, who has no inhibitions about the human cost to his army and people, seeks to extract from the conflict enough leverage to dictate the conditions for his and his sons survival.  Saddam has been playing a game of chess in last couple of days. He has pulled back his Republican Guard from many major cities. In doing so he has beefed up the Republican Guard presence around his two centres of power. viz. Baghdad and Tikrit. All indications of the fact that Saddam knows that the war will never result in an Iraqi victory. Only thing that remains is to salvage his pride.    On another front, the Sunni Saddam is striving to enlist a powerful weapon, the rival Shiah, Iraqs largest population segment. DEBKAfiles intelligence sources report that, Sunday, March 30, Irans spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei directed Iraqi Shiites not to rise up against Saddam Hussein or help the US-UK coalition topple his regime. The order was conveyed through their leaders  the Tehran-based SCIRI (Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq) and the Dawa Party. The Tehran governments calculus was simple: The Shiites can afford to stand aside while the Iraqis and Americans spill each others blood. The Shiites will gather the spoils whoever comes out on top.  Saddam, picking up fast on the Tehran-Shiite strategy, directed his spokesmen to start using Shiite terminology. The Iraqi officer who blew himself up to murder four American soldiers near Najef was posthumously renamed Al-Husayn Ben Ali after the son of the first Iraqi Shiite leader who lived in the Karbala region in the seventh century. This gesture was aimed at making the suicide bomber a martyr honored by the Shiites.   In the Arab world, its all about being a martyr for a cause. If the Shiites view the suicide bomber's death in the light that Saddam wants them to see, any hopes of a Shiite upsrising in the North or anywhere in Iraq would remain a pipe-dream for the Allies.  It is hard for the American psy-op machine to get a handle on these arcane yet tidal semantic currents or fit the coalition message into their powerful religious context. In the race for the hearts of the Shiites who make up more than half of Iraqs population Saddam has the advantage of being able to manipulate these nuances, leaving coalition forces to address the Shiites in what sounds to them like an alien tongue.  The price for this unfamiliarity with shifting local mores was paid on Sunday, March 30, when British forces launched Operation James in the Basra region and failed to make headway after finding themselves let down by the predominantly Shiite citizenry. For Basras Shiites, the Imam Ali is clearly a far more potent icon than 007.   Clearly, Gen. Franks needs to chalk a strategy that takes into account Saddam's mind-games. Flyers and pamphlets do not make as much of a psychological impact as do the subtle communal machinations of the tyrant of Baghdad.

       urlLink The battle between Donald Rumsfeld and The Pentagon    As the ground campaign against Saddam Hussein faltered last week, with attenuated supply lines and a lack of immediate reinforcements, there was anger in the Pentagon. Several senior war planners complained to me in interviews that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his inner circle of civilian advisers, who had been chiefly responsible for persuading President Bush to lead the country into war, had insisted on micromanaging the wars operational details. Rumsfelds team took over crucial aspects of the day-to-day logistical planningtraditionally, an area in which the uniformed military excelsand Rumsfeld repeatedly overruled the senior Pentagon planners on the Joint Staff, the operating arm of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He thought he knew better, one senior planner said. He was the decision-maker at every turn. [link via  urlLink WarFilter ]

       The real battle, folks, is yet to begin!     Who Are Saddam's Most Loyal Forces?    Republican Guard  60,000-100,000 Controlled by Saddam's younger son and heir, Qusay, the Guard includes three divisions deployed around Baghdad and one near Saddam's hometown of Tikrit. Guard forces crushed a Shi'ite uprising in Basra in 1991. Though the Guard's heavy weaponry is outdated, U.S. officials believe Saddam may have deployed chemical weapons to the Medina Division.   Special Republican Guard  15,000-25,000 Largely recruited from Saddam's al-Bu Nasir tribe and other loyal groups, SRG troops are scattered throughout Baghdad and well-trained in urban combat. Its units protect Saddam and top Baath Party officials.   Fedayeen Saddam ("Saddam's Men of Sacrifice")  20,000-25,000 Formed in 1995, the fedayeen handpicks members as teenagers from loyal tribal areas and are considered among the fiercest of Saddam's fighters. Often disguised in civilian garb, fedayeen units have mounted attacks against coalition troops. Operating outside the law, the group has a "death squadron" that executes people in their homes   Al Quds (Jerusalem) Army  Size unknown A volunteer civilian group, the Quds militia was founded by Saddam in September 2000 with the supposed purpose of "liberating Palestine." Now providing domestic defense, Quds fighters (which include women) are trained in basic combat. They have staged guerrilla attacks outside Baghdad, then faded into residential areas when pursued   Secret Police and Spies  15,000-25,000 Saddam has eight overlapping security agencies. These include layers of domestic and foreign spies, guerrilla operatives and "enforcers" who intimidate Iraqis to fight. Qusay leads the most powerful agencies, and members may have access to chemical or biological weapons. The U.S. believes more than 300 agents are working abroad under diplomatic cover   [from the  urlLink April 7, 2003 issue  of the TIME magazine]  And I'm sure the Allies will face a tough resistance from these forces. They are highly motivated and loyal to Saddam, unlike the rabble that is the regulation Iraqi army. Moreover, these forces will fight to the last man and probably use the civilians as shields, making it a tough urban battle in the Baghdad streets. Here, the air-superiority of the Coalition forces will not mean much, unless they are ready for huge  (and I mean, huge!!)  collateral damages.  Testing times, for sure!

       urlLink SARS was born in weapons lab: Russian scientist     The virus of atypical pneumonia, better known as SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, was created artificially, possibly as a bacteriological weapon, Sergei Kolesnikov, academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, told a press conference in the Siberian town of Irkutsk on Thursday, the Russian RIA Novosti news agency reported.  According to Kolesnikov, the virus of atypical pneumonia is a synthesis of the viruses of measles and infectious parotiditis or mumps, the natural compound of which is impossible. This can be done only in a laboratory, he said.  Now, much before SARS became a global threat and when it was just a disturbing problem in South East Asia, I had this chat with a friend. And I, being a conspiracy theorist that I am, had hypothesized that SARS could be lab-created virus that was let loose as a smokescreen. Geez! my brain thinks up such weird stuff these days!!... and when it comes true, it just feels so smug!! ;-)

       urlLink Speed of sound is silenced    Concorde, the world's first supersonic passenger jet, will be grounded in the autumn after a plunge in passenger numbers and a string of high-profile technical problems.  British Airways and Air France will announce the decision today, following months of deliberation with technical advisers from Airbus. [link via  urlLink Metafilter ] Well, I've never travelled in a Concorde, but I'm a wee bit sad to note that it'll no more take to the skies!  By the way, a trivia question. Do you know why the Concorde's nose is crooked  (or bent, pointing towards the ground) ?

       urlLink Iraq's UN ambassador says 'game is over'    In the first admission by an Iraqi official that US-led forces have seized control of Baghdad, the country's ambassador to the United Nations said, "The game is over" and hoped Iraqis would have a peaceful life.  Amen to that! Lets hope that we have seen/heard the last of Saddam Hussein.  Though that may just be wishful thinking. If the question that haunted people all over the world in the past few weeks was " Where is Raed? " then the one that'll certainly haunt the people in the coming weeks would be " Where is Saddam? "  Appearing on 60 Minutes on CBS, Said Aburish, one of Saddam Hussein's biographers said (when asked if Saddam could have escaped before Baghdad fell),  I dont think thats ever a consideration for Saddam Hussein, says Aburish. That would have given away everything he ever stood for. He had this preoccupation from the time he was in his 20s: I belong in this page of Arab history. Going down with Baghdad, going down with the ship completes him.  According to Aburish, who has studied Saddam for decades, the most important thing in life for this Iraqi leader is to be remembered by the Arabs as another Saladin, the Muslim warrior who triumphed over the Crusaders 800 years ago. [Read  urlLink more ] Sources in the British intelligence have been quoted saying that though Saddam was almost certainly in the targeted building at some point, he was "probably" not there when the bombs were dropped.  So that means, just like Elvis,  Saddam has left the building !

         Amidst drumrolls and blowing trumpets and the clash of cymballs, let me announce the unveiling of this week's Blog Mela which is in its seventh edition this time around.   urlLink Jayakrishnan Nair  clinically dissects Arundhati Roy's arguments on the war, US and Saddam. Easily the most-nominated post of this Blog Mela. And in another of his posts,  urlLink Jayakrishnan  argues why we could have reasons to suspect the motives of an organization that supposedly represents the interests of Indo-Americans in the US.   urlLink Niraj  lays bare the hypocrisy of some of the students of Stanford University who want to disassociate the University's name from the Hoover Institution under the pretext that Hoover Institution is composed of war-mongers and the association stifles "academic freedom".   urlLink Jyotsna Kamat  talks about Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya on the occasion of her birth centennial, giving us an informative insight into the life and work of this multi-faceted lady who was a trade-unionist, a revolutionary, a reformer, a great patron of arts, an accomplished writer (she has authored twelve books), an orator, and a freedom fighter - a truly amazing Indian woman.   urlLink Kingsley  makes a profound discovery as he has iron and dates on his mind (to know what that means, you ought to read the post!) ;-)   urlLink Swami  (April 7 post. Permalinks not working.) makes an interesting point about how conflict, disagreement, argument and even war are essentially parts of an equilibrium.   urlLink Sankar Narayan  (April 3 post. Permalinks not working) has an interesting insight into the impacts of the Iraq war on the Indian IT industry.   urlLink Vikas Kamat  traces the history of the Khilafat Movement and its place in the Indian freedom movement in an insightful post. As the person who nominated this post pointed out, "More people should be aware of the story."   urlLink Rohini  (April 8 post, titled "Your name in the Headlines". Permalinks not working.) attacks the concept of "news-selling" that has been embraced by some newspapers recently, notably The Times of India.   urlLink Anita  (April 5 and April 8 posts. Permalinks not working.) posts some of her delightful memories of her trip, as she talks about her long walks at Auroville or when she bemoans the "efficiency" of the Railways booking system at the Howrah Railway Station in Kolkata.   urlLink Dina Mehta  observes the importance of colour in the way it is a reflection of our emotional states, moods, attitudes, personality, society - in short, any form of human existence.   urlLink Yazad  (April 2 post. Permalinks not working.) discovers a deep philosophical insight while watching a TV serial.  And that folks, was a roundup of some of this week's hand-picked blogs from the Indian Blogworld!!

       urlLink  YES, all four wars    Some poor idiot named (??) Robert Price apparently posted comments to one of Varsha Bhosle's articles. And in doing so, all but invited Varsha to slam his feet into his own mouth.  This Robert Price person tried to indicate how Pakistan has "won" all the four wars that it has fought against India and how Pakistan's brilliant military strategies  (ahem!)  have had India begging to the world asking its help to rein in Pakistan.  Varsha Bhosle delivers a point-by-point rebuttal buttressed with references that no one can refute. And thus, she blasts Robert Price's argument into nothingness. I am tempted to quote some of Varsha's best  (and sweet-sounding to my Indian ears)  arguments, but I'll just quote the final remarks that she makes. I urge you to go and read the full article.  I'm sooo tired of gloating now. Maybe another day I'll tell you what the Indian Army was up against in Kargil... NO! I don't mean Paki "valour"; I refer to terrain and climate. But this article's been long. But, that's the nature of Indian Defence: We may take long, but we make a comprehensive kill in one stroke -- like the kukri to the NLI throat.    NLI  refers to Pakistan's Northern Light Infantry which was wiped out completely during their foolhardy adventure atop the mountain peaks in Kargil and Drass.  Woohooo!!... Way to go Varsha!!

       urlLink Final human genome sequence released    This time it is the real thing, scientists promise - the complete sequence of human DNA, as perfectly rendered as it ever will be.  ...  "What we've got now is what we'll have for all eternity," says Francis Collins, director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute and the head of the consortium of 16 international institutions that collaborated to sequence the code.  [link via  urlLink Slashdot ] But as they've already  urlLink observed , humans have significantly lesser number of genes than was earlier thought.  While past estimates varied up to 140,000, two international scientific teams have now shown the true number is between 27,000 and 40,000.  ...  "The small number of genes is significant [because it means] we're not hard-wired," says Craig Venter, head of one team at the private company Celera.  "People think genes are an absolute cause of traits. But the notion that the genome is the blueprint for humanity is a very bad metaphor," he says. If you think we're hard-wired and deterministic, there should indeed be a lot more genes."

He said that if such weapons were found on Syrian soil: "I'm quite sure we would have to respond to that". [link via  urlLink Metafilter ] Mr. Richard Perle, I think you and your idiot pretzel-fearing boss could do better by using all your resources to try and find any proof of those WMDs in Iraq first. Warheads with  traces  of nerve agent don't count if you are trying to justify invasion of a country.  So, before you talk about  doing an Iraq  on Syria, first attend to the business that you've left unfinished in the last year or so...  viz.  finiding Osama, finding WMDs in Iraq, etc.  And if anyone thinks this is an anti-American view... think again! This is just an anti-idiotarian view!

Another good link is provided by theonering.net and has some more info about the actual footage.  [link via  urlLink Slashdot ] This news is like sweet music for all LoTR fans! And the icing on the cake is the fact that the final part of the LoTR trilogy,  urlLink The Return of the King  is slated for worldwide release less than a month after the Special Edition DVD of The Two Towers comes out,  i.e.  on 17th December 2003. So, mark down that date on your calendars too! :-)

       urlLink Blackwill acted as India's spokesman: Pakistan    Pakistan on Monday described outgoing United States envoy to India, Robert Blackwill, as a 'spokesman of the Indian external affairs ministry'. Foreign Office spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan said Kashmiris would be delighted to see the back of Blackwill, who recently announced that he would go back to teaching at the Harvard University.   Ok, if Blackwill is Indian MEA spokesman, then who is Aziz Ahmad Khan?... spokesman for the Kashmiri people??  Moreover this "spokesman" haughtily announces that Pakistan would not accept Farooq Abdullah in an Indian delegation that wishes to travel to Pakistan.  "... It was during the tenure of Farooq Abdullah that maximum atrocities were committed against the Kashmiri people," he said.  "He has blood of Kashmiri people on his hands and he should first apologise to Kashmiri people and apologise to the [All Parties] Hurriyat Conference.  "If they forgive him, perhaps a delegation led by APHC leaders, in which others can be included, would be welcomed to Pakistan."  God!! if Farooq Abdullah has Kashmiri blood on his hands, then you Mr. Aziz Ahmad Khan, and your country, has Indian blood on your hands, legs, body and face. You're splattered with it!!  You know what this is called?? ... It's a classic case of pot calling the kettle black!!

Are these PETA people serious?? Or has advocating too much of veggies turned these people into vegetables, incapable of thought!  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says the name Hamburg conjures up images of slaughtered cows and unhealthy meals.  Really??! So, what would they like the towns to be named instead?... Cabbageville??... or perhaps Broccoliburg??!  Idiots!! [link via  urlLink Metafilter ]

       Give your hard drive a dose of proteins!   urlLink Proteins produce nano-magnetic computer memory      Computer hard drive capacity could be increased a hundredfold by using a common protein to fabricate nano-scale magnetic particles, claims UK company Nanomagnetics  It uses the protein apoferritin, the main molecule in which iron is stored in the body, to create a material consisting of magnetic particles each just a few nanometres in diameter. Each particle can store a bit of information and together they can be packed onto a disk drive at much greater density than is possible using existing hard disk manufacturing methods.

EMI said on Wednesday it was supplying 140,000 songs for download through 20 European digital music distributors including Microsoft's MSN, music channel MTV and retailer HMV.  [link via  urlLink OnlineBlog ] Hmmm... having brought Napster down to its knees, it was inevitable that the big daddies of the music industry would themselves jump into the fray.  The big players are going to do the same thing as Napster did... although the downloads would cost around 1 per song (which is a stiff price to say the least!). Then an album (which has about 14-15 songs) would cost an exorbitant 15!!  Gee!! these people think they can get away with murder!

       The Ranji Trophy Final  between Mumbai and Tamil Nadu is interestingly poised. With only the last day to go today, Tamil Nadu still have to make 275 runs with seven of their wickets intact currently!  Mumbai on the other hand will bet on the fact that Tamil Nadu's star of the first innings, test discard, S. Ramesh was out cheaply. Other things in Mumbai's favour are... Tamil Nadu is batting last on a pitch that has been exposed to the severe Mumbai  heat for the last four days... Mumbai has two quality spinners who can extract good spin using the conditions very well... Early morning advantage can be claimed with pacemen like Agarkar and Salvi steaming in at the TN batsmen.  The odds look stacked heavily in Mumbai's favour.  yayyyy!!   But the crux of the matter is that even in this May heat, the players from both the teams have given us a match worthy of a final of the premier cricket tournament in India.  For all the claims of being a cricket-crazed nation, the empty stands at Wankhede stadium pose questions that no one can answer. Are we really a cricket-crazy nation?? Or just a nation of idol-worshippers??!  Best of luck, Mumbai!!   [update]  Mumbai have won the Ranji Trophy final match against Tamil Nadu by 140 runs. As I had said in my post, the spinners did short work of the Tamil Nadu batsmen, as they scalped 7 of the 10 wickets to fall. Sairaj Bahutule continued his good form as he grabbed 5 wickets in exchange of 70 runs. And thus, Mumbai regain the Ranji Trophy, something they are so used to doing!! [/update]

So, its not necessarily the virus that's claiming the lives of so many people! It's our own body that is kiiling us!! Sever immune reactions can be terrible!! I've once witnessed, first hand, a severe immune reaction and it was terrible to watch!!  Moreover, there is disturbing news as far as the life of the SARS virus is concerned!!  Scientists have also discovered that the SARS virus can remain viable for at least 24 hours after being deposited in a droplet on a plastic surface - a simulation, for example, of an infected person coughing on to the wall of a lift.  ...  In a study in Germany reported by Sthr, the virus was dropped in liquid on to a plastic surface, the drop was dried, and examined after 24 hours. "There were 10,000 virus units per millitre before, and after 24 hours there were 1000 - and that was viable viruses."  [via  urlLink NewScientist ] Now, the only hope is that we find some way to fight this killer virus before it mutates into something uncontrollable!!

       India as a punching bag.  Bashing India and its culture or the lack thereof seems to be a popular sport all around the world these days. In just the last couple of days, two incidents have incited some irrelevant and arbitrary people to hurl some vitriol India's way.  First it was the " urlLink heroic act " by 21 year old Nisha Sharma, of reporting her husband-to-be to the police and getting him arrested on their wedding day for demanding dowry and mistreating her father. Quite a courageous act!! There was a  urlLink mention  of this news on Metafilter on May 15 2003 and a few comments appeared on that. That should've been the end of the issue.  But no!! just the next day (May 16 2003) the same news ( although from a different source ) was  urlLink posted  on Metafilter by a MeFi user named  urlLink elpapacito .  First point about this post by elpapacito was that he, quite idiotically, had made a double post since this story had already been posted on Metafilter. But that was the least of his brainless acts!!  I quote from the post made by elpapacito... Not surprisingly she is a "software engineer" student probably a programmer with some clue. Groom goes to jail. On a tangent, your job position is currently being outsourced to this "civilized" country with only 7000 dowry deaths in 2001. Whoa!! ... and since it was a double post... Double Whoa!! * complete with a What-the-fuck?! look on the face *  Now what the hell has her being a software engineer have to do with her guts? Since coincidentally I am a "software engineer" too, I wonder if I missed something along the line. No one taught me how to be brave and stand up for yourself during my college years. I mean it certainly wasn't in the curriculum... nor was it in the job description when I took on the job as a "software engineer". So what is this "elpapa idiot o" trying to convey?? Does it have any relation to the news or is he just trying to take a potshot at Indians in general. Quite clearly any dumb person with half a brain will tell you that "elpapa idiot o" has been afflicted by the sour-grapes syndrome. He is just whining like a low-life. And trying to link two altogether unrelated issues.  Well "elpapa idiot o", the reason why Indian "programmers with some clue" are getting  your  jobs is because we  have  "some clue"!!  Does this idiot know what he's ranting about? Making a reference to the 7000 dowry deaths in India he gets on the high horse and questions the civilized nature of the Indian society. As an Indian, I'm deeply ashamed by the practice of dowry deaths as I am by various other retrograde practices attributed to religion and culture. But what the hell is all this about?!!  Civilization cannot be quantified so easily, as someone rightly claims in the flame war started by that idiot's post. And "elpapa idiot o" seems to agree as he says, I think that unless we all use the very same function to evaluate what is more or less civilized, we'll never be able to quantize a "civilization" level and express it with numbers, so making a comparison apples-2-apples possible. ... And given that death, I believe, it's one of the fundamental , constact factors that excludes absolutely nobody anywhere in the world and that nobody (unless strongly emotionally disturbed) welcomes, we could try to evaluate the "civilization" level of different groups of people by how violence leading to death is tolerated or (sometimes) accepted in their social group. I think that any group of people that has some rule (written or not written) that allows violence toward some other human being as socially tolerable/acceptable can't be really considered "civilized". Isn't that lovely??! Such a clear cut definition of "civilization"!! Now... I'll produce some facts and figures. Lets see!!  *  In 1999, there were 28,874 gun-related deaths in the United States - over 80 deaths every day. ( Source: Hoyert DL, Arias E, Smith BL, Murphy SL, Kochanek, KD.  Deaths: Final Data for 1999. National Vital Statistics Reports. 2001;49 (8). )   *  In 1999, 58% of all gun deaths were suicides, and 38% were homicides.( SOURCE: Hoyert DL, Arias E, Smith BL, Murphy SL, Kochanek, KD.  Deaths: Final Data for 1999. National Vital Statistics Reports. 2001;49 (8). )   Do you realize what that means??... It means in 1999, there were almost 11,000 fatalities due to gun abuse, in USA!!    *  In 2000, 75,685 people (27/100,000) suffered non-fatal firearm gunshot injuries.  ( SOURCE: Federal Bureau of Investigation. Uniform Crime Reports for the United States: Crime in the United States 2000: Uniform Crime Reports.  Washington, D.C: U.S. Department of Justice; 2001. )   *  USA tops the list of nations with the highest gun deaths in a year. It boasts of a rate of 4.08 gun deaths per 100,000 population. Canada comes in next... with the figure of 0.54 per 100,000. ( SOURCE: Data collected by Philip Alpers, Harvard Injury Control Research Center, and HELP Network )  Above data taken from  urlLink Gun Control Network  And if you look at the spousal abuse, a recent press release by Amnesty Internation states, and I quote Violence against women is one of the most pervasive, yet hidden of human rights abuses. It is rooted in a global culture of discrimination which denies women their fundamental rights. No political or economic system or culture is exempt when it comes to allowing and justifying violence against women - in USA a woman is raped every six minutes, in Russia about 14,000 women are estimated to be killed in domestic violence annually. This year, more than 15,000 women will be sold into sexual slavery in China. And if you want more... According to the Uniform Crime Report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 30% of women killed in the United States die at the hands of a husband or boyfriend.  The FBI reports that between 1976 and 1996, domestic violence claimed the lives of more than four women each day ( SOURCE: Lawrence A. Greenfeld et al. (1998). Violence by Intimates: Analysis of Data on Crimes by Current or Former Spouses, Boyfriends, and Girlfriends. Bureau of Justice Statistics Factbook. Washington DC: U.S. Department of Justice. NCJ #167237. Available from National Criminal Justice Reference Service. ) Civilized society, eh?! Highly civilized I would say!!  I have nothing against America or any other country for that matter ( except perhaps against Pakistan... but that is entirely a separate issue! ). But if someone tries to put down India, then that really gets me worked up!! My only advice to those who like to pick on India is... Don't fuck with us!!  Another instance of needless India-bashing was the linking of Vijay Singh's (the golfer) comments about Annika Sorenstam's decision to play the men's circuit, to his Indian roots. In case you haven't read it yet,  urlLink here is the story . As much as I would like to rip up those arguments by the racist columnists, I shall pass on that opportunity since I've ranted too much already!!

      It's Mela time folks!! Announcing the 12th edition of the  Bharateeya Blog Mela  - the best of Indian blogosphere this week!!     Holy Cow!! The humble cow has been the subject of many a posts this week after the Central Government said "Ok" to enacting a law banning cow-slaughter in India! Here are a select few of those cow chronicles...   urlLink Shanti  is irritated by the Government's attempts to mix religion with politics when it tries to ban cow-slaughter. She consider that  urlLink This is so stupid! . This post generated a lot of discussion as can be seen from the number of comments to it.   urlLink Sandeep  delves into the annals ancient Indian history to look at the  urlLink Beef-Eating Brouhaha  from various angles. A very well researched and exhaustive post indeed!   urlLink Jayakrishnan Nair  has a brief extract from the book, Gem in the Lotus by Abraham Eraly, in his post titled,  urlLink Holy Cow!  to show that "beef" was a normal article of contemporary Brahmin diet during the Vedic times. In another of his posts,  urlLink Buddha, A Non-Vegetarian , JK again quotes from the same book to highlight the fact that non-vegetarianism was a common practice in Hinduism as well as Buddhism.  After paying due respects to the  Kamadhenu , we move on to other, worldly affairs...   urlLink Suman Palit  is  urlLink Weary of GM  activism as he hopes that the backlash against the anti-GM activism grows from a few muted voices to a roar across the globe.   urlLink Niraj  explains the futility of the attempts to  urlLink Ressurect the Non-Aligned Movement  by certain ex-UN "officials", claiming that NAM will just be another white elephant. In another post, Niraj declares that  urlLink Arundhati Roy doesn't want to help Iraqis .   urlLink Rohini 's post on summer  urlLink Specials  takes a look at the "dumbing down" phenomenon affecting the Indians today... something to which the proliferation of newspapers and TV channels is contributing generously.   urlLink Kingsley Jegan  offers a clue in his  urlLink post  to determine whether a computer user is an expert or a novice, based on the user's pre-emptive mouse movements.   urlLink Mahesh , in his post titled  Socially backward, idiotically forward  [dated 10 th  2003] tells a funny incident in which an ignoramus wrote to him asking for the $500 that BlogShares was supposedly giving away for registering with their site!!  JK features once more in this list as he discusses some  urlLink More Praful Bidwai Jokes .   urlLink Ravikiran  pokes holes in Praful Bidwai's arguments about McCarthyism's rise in India, in his post titled,  urlLink Deafening Silence .   urlLink Gaurav Sabnis  [permalinks not working, post dated 12 th  2003]proposes an interesting alternative plan to promote tourism in India. He calls it  Libertourism !! Same day, another great post!! Gaurav writes another interesting post on the same day [May 12, 2003], titled  Citty Bitty  in which he talks about the character of some Indian cities. Nicely done, Gaurav!!  Dina has a slew of great posts this week. I shall make a list!!... 1.  urlLink Creativity - what we play is life  : Dina laments the lack of creativity in our daily lives. 2.  urlLink Marketing Blogs to Corporates  : Dina attempts to bridge the chasm between blogs and business organizations by suggesting how blogs could be effectively used as Knowledge Management tools. 3. Then she goes on to give a round-up of some excellent posts on  urlLink Weblogs and Knowledge Management   That's about all we have for this week!! Thanks to all of you who sent in their nominations for this week's Mela. And another round of thanks to  urlLink Ashwini  and  urlLink Shanti  who let me host this week's BBM.  Cheers!

       urlLink Can Daypop Stay Out of Google's Headlights?    How much of a Midas touch does  urlLink Google  wield? Google News -- still in beta -- has more mainstream cachet than AltaVista News, AlltheWeb and NewsIsFree combined. So when  urlLink Reuters  (and the  urlLink Register ) picked up a comment Google CEO Eric Schmidt recently made about offering a service for searching weblogs, Daypop's Dan Chan was concerned. "Well it was fun while it lasted..."  urlLink wrote the man  behind the popular weblog and news search tool,  urlLink Daypop , assuming he was dead meat.  Not a very comfortable position for Dan Chan, is it?! Though Google hasn't officially announced anything to the effect, its quite clear that once Google flings itself wholeheartedly into the "weblog search" pond, the smaller fish will be thrown out unceremoniously!  Chan knows that there's no way he can compete with Google and that they could take all his traffic in a heartbeat. He's nervous but stays optimistic that Google could perhaps lift all boats by bringing more attention to weblogs. Or is that the rationale of a deer caught in the headlights?

       urlLink Vote goes by the book as Austen wins    It is a generally acknowledged cliche that whenever readers are asked their favourite books by women, they will reply Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights - and so it proves in a survey released today of the 50 best books in the history of women's literature.   ...  The most hyped author of the last decade, JK Rowling, beats all her contemporaries with four placings. Her hero's original outing, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, did the best, at number 13.  There are four Jane Austen books listed, three in the top 10, and Austen also achieved a unique literary twinning, sharing 23rd place for Sense and Sensibility with Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary.  Virginia Woolf and George Eliot each have three books on the list, and Iris Murdoch two.  [via  urlLink Guardian ] For the complete list of the books in the order of their ranking, click  urlLink here   Now that's what I call an excellent collection of books!!

       urlLink Wired 11.06: "If We Run Out of Batteries, This War is Screwed."   A good article on how technology aided Donald Rumsfeld's theory of swarm tactics. Following are a few interesting excerpts from it.   The history of warfare is marked by periodic leaps in technology - the triumph of the longbow at Crcy, in 1346; the first decisive use of air power, in World War I; the terrifying destructiveness of nuclear weapons at Hiroshima, in 1945. And now this: a dazzling array of technology that signals the arrival of digital warfare. What we saw in Gulf War II was a new age of fighting that combined precision weapons, unprecedented surveillance of the enemy, agile ground forces, and - above all - a real-time communications network that kept the far-flung operation connected minute by minute.  Now Mims draws a bunch of small circles spread out on the page. This is Rumsfeld's theory of swarm tactics. Because technology allows soldiers to keep track of each other, even when they're out of one another's sight, they can now move in any formation. "We may not always know exactly where the enemy is," Mims explains, "but we know where we are. When the enemy engages us in this spread-out fashion, we send air cover to protect the unit until the support forces arrive."  Swarm theory holds that you move fast and don't worry about securing the rear. The benefits to this are many. First, you need fewer troops and less equipment. War becomes cheaper. Second, it's harder for the enemy to attack a widely dispersed formation. Third, units can cover much more ground - they aren't forced to maintain the wedge by slowing down to accommodate lagging vehicles. Fourth, swarming allows you to go straight for the heart of the enemy's command structure, undermining its support from the inside out rather than battling on the periphery.  Swarm theory is also moving online - into chat rooms, an application Mims is pioneering for military purposes. When a problem develops on the battlefield, a soldier radios a Tactical Operations Center. The TOC intelligence guy types the problem into a chat session - Mims and his colleagues use Microsoft Chat - and the problem is "swarmed" by experts from the Pentagon to Centcom. Not only is the technology changing the way we maneuver, Mims notes, it's changing the way we think. Quite an interesting theory!! And not just a theory since we've already seen it pass the gruelling test in the recent war in Iraq, with flying colours. "What's funny about using Microsoft Chat," he adds with a sly smile, "is that everybody has to choosean icon to represent themselves. Some of these guys haven't bothered, so the program assigns them one. We'll be in the middle of a battle and a bunch of field artillery colonels will come online in the form of these big-breasted blondes. We've got a few space aliens, too." ROTFL!! Well at least their sense of humour was intact in the heat of the war!!  And finally... In the war to change the way war is fought, the techies seem to have won the first battle. Despite the heat and the glitches and the holes in the communications network, Rumsfeld's great experiment is being hailed a success. The revolutionaries now have plenty of ammunition for their drive to change the military. But the success papers over the uncertainties that remain. The next enemy - North Korea? Syria? Iran? - may be better prepared and better equipped, and will certainly have learned from Saddam Hussein's experience. Perhaps more likely, the next enemy won't be a nation-state at all but an adaptable terrorist organization much less vulnerable to swarming tanks and missiles. Quite true !!

The friend, Sina Montallebi, wrote that he had been summoned to appear before the religious police.  The next day, Mr. Montallebi became the first person in history to be jailed for the crime of keeping a Weblog.  Gee!! I'm a criminal too!! Maybe I should go and get an anticipatory bail!!

       urlLink Novell Jumps to Linux Rescue   While  SCO  is gung-ho about collecting license fees from Linux users (which I personally think is a silly idea to harbour even for a moment),  urlLink Novell  has jumped into the fray in this game of corporate one-upmanship.  Companies are suddenly mounting a vigorous counterattack to SCO Group's claims that the Linux operating system is polluted with code misappropriated from Unix, and that Linux users should pay SCO license fees for their use of SCO-owned Unix code.  The most damaging blow so far came from Novell, which on Wednesday said that it, not SCO, owns the key Unix copyrights and patents in question, and will challenge SCO's claims that Linux illegally contains chunks of misappropriated code. SCO responded to Novell's claims by reiterating its stance and claiming that it intends to "aggresively continue" with its legal actions.  The open-source community is watching this corporate war with great interest. While many of them feel that this war is getting funnier by the day, there are others who are outraged by this petty-minded commercialization of open-source efforts. "We wrote our Unix and Linux code as a gift and an expression of art, to be enjoyed by our peers and used by others for all licit purposes both nonprofit and for-profit," open source software advocate Eric Raymond wrote in a  urlLink position paper  about this fray. "We did not write it to have it appropriated by men so dishonorable that after making profit from our gift for eight years they could turn around and insult our competence." Well said Mr. Raymond!!

       urlLink In quotes : Reasons for the Iraq war  US and UK leaders floated many reasons for the war on Iraq before it began, from Saddam Hussein's oppression of the Iraqi people to his refusal to release prisoners of war he was said to be holding.  But Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction - in defiance of United Nations resolutions - was among the most frequently mentioned.  Now one of the leading proponents of the war, US Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, has said that while there were many reasons to go to war, the Bush administration chose to focus on weapons of mass destruction because it was the one issue behind which all factions could unite. But we already knew that didn't we?! ;-)  This article also gives a selection of reasons, for the military action in Iraq, put forth by various people at various times starting from September last year. It makes for an interesting reading!!  link via  urlLink Technorati Breaking News Cosmos

       Virtual is real  A study conducted by the  urlLink The Work Foundation  in UK has concluded that the Web is much more localised, more honest and far less chaotic than it is usually given credit for.   urlLink Online communities get real  So-called social software - e-mail, messaging systems, weblogs and shared online diaries - is allowing people to make the net work for them and bring the virtual world home.  New phenomena such as weblogs have allowed people to share their interest and passions with a wider audience but often provide a quite mundane and honest view of life. The report also mentions that the existing notions that people would thrive on false personas over the impersonal Net are being borne out as people  are using social software to support real world interaction and to enhance face-to-face contact rather than departing from it.  Another key aspect of online communities is the ability to generate and build up public opinions. And people power is also being helped by online communities such as epinions.com, a site which allows consumers to give their views on any products they have bought.  "As knowledge management and access to information have become central to all of our social and economic well being, so it has happened that social networks have grown in power," said Will Hutton, Chief Executive of The Work Foundation. Will Davies of The Work Foundation sums it up best when he says, " People are finally ditching the two-worlds view, which separates the internet from everyday life and now realise the two are part of one picture ".

       urlLink Take on Gates, Kalam tells Indian techies   President A P J Abdul Kalam on Wednesday urged Indian IT professionals to develop and specialise in open source code software rather than use proprietary solutions based on systems such as Microsoft Windows. Now that is an interesting thing to say!! Politicians are generally loath at saying something so drastic. But then... President APJ Abdul Kalam isn't a politician!! Thank god for that!!  He made this statement at IIIT (International Institute of Information Technology) at Hinjewadi in Pune. IIIT was dedicated to the nation on Wednesday.  President Kalam also made a reference to his conversation with Bill Gates... He said that during a discussion with Microsoft CEO Bill Gates at the Rashtrapati Bhavan a few months ago, he had discussed the issue of software security and the need to look for open source codes. "Our discussions became difficult since our views were different," Kalam said.

       Now don't say they didn't warn you about this!   urlLink Massive tsunami sweeps Atlantic Coast in asteroid impact scenario for March 16, 2880   If an asteroid crashes into the Earth, it is likely to splash down somewhere in the oceans that cover 70 percent of the planet's surface. Huge tsunami waves, spreading out from the impact site like the ripples from a rock tossed into a pond, would inundate heavily populated coastal areas. A computer simulation of an asteroid impact tsunami developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows waves as high as 400 feet sweeping onto the Atlantic Coast of the United States.  link via  urlLink Slashdot  The probability that this asteroid would indeed crash into Earth is about 0.3% which is quite low. But consider the effects if indeed the asteroid crashed... The 60,000-megaton blast of the impact vaporizes the asteroid and blows a cavity in the ocean 11 miles across and all the way down to the seafloor, which is about 3 miles deep at that point. The blast even excavates some of the seafloor. Water then rushes back in to fill the cavity, and a ring of waves spreads out in all directions. The impact creates tsunami waves of all frequencies and wavelengths, with a peak wavelength about the same as the diameter of the cavity. Because lower-frequency waves travel faster than waves with higher frequencies, the initial impulse spreads out into a series of waves. Errr... not very comforting, is it?!!

Mr Amir escaped - not into a far-off town or neighbouring country, but into a space sandwiched between two walls in his parents' home.  He said for the whole of his hiding he never left that small, dark space and had only a tiny peephole to view the outside world.  link via  urlLink Metafilter

      What happens when people stop viewing movies just for the pleasure of the experience and start reading too much into the theme of the movie?! They start philosophizing about it and start drawing allegories based on the details seen in the movie.   urlLink Matrix , with its futuristic plot and ideas provided a lot of cannon for the "philosophers" who wrote reams about the coded allusions that were liberally sprinkled throughout the movie.  And, the Wachowski brothers did not help the matters either. When asked how many hidden messages there were in "The Matrix," they once teased, "More than you'll ever know."  And now with the release of  urlLink Matrix Reloaded , philosophers are once again having a field day! ;-)   urlLink Philosophers draw on the film Matrix   [NYTimes registration required]  Now that its sequel, "Matrix Reloaded," is out, the interpretive industry is also gearing up. After the first film, Christian allegorists leaped at the bait the authors left: characters named Neo and Trinity, allusions to Jesus and resurrection, a city named Zion. The Buddhist character of Neo's "awakening" to reality's veil of illusion was discussed. And academic interest grew because the film self-consciously tapped current fascination with pop culture and critical theory. Recent anthologies have included " `The Matrix' and Philosophy," edited by William Irwin (Open Court), "Taking the Red Pill," edited by Glenn Yeffeth (Benbella Books), and "Exploring the Matrix," edited by Karen Haber (St. Martin's Press). Even the Warner Brothers "Matrix" Web site contains a growing collection of papers by academic philosophers And now, keeping in mind the current flavour... terrorism, the interpreters are claiming that The Matrix represents contemporary America with all its problems. And the solution or response to the 'hegemonic' power is said to be "terrorism". Similarly, in "The Matrix," Morpheus tells Neo he must regard all inhabitants of that virtual world as enemies that may be killed; anyway, most people are "not ready" for the truth. Morpheus is even wanted by the Matrix's ruthless agents for "acts of terrorism." And going one step further philosophers are also giving it an almost divine colour... In fact we eventually learn through cryptic pronouncements of the Architect of the Matrix  its software writer, its God  that Neo is actually living in the sixth version of the Matrix. In each, a savior figure has arisen. And in each earlier case, the savior has not been able to free humanity at all. Instead, the result has been a large-scale loss of life, until the Matrix begins again, with an apparent upgrade  a new web of earthly illusions  allowing no recollections of the disastrous past.  Now doesn't this sound suspiciously like " Yada Yada Hi Dharmasya. Glanirva Bhavathi Bharatha,. Abhyuthanam Adharmaysya. Tadatmanam Srijami Aham ", the famous verse from Bhagavad Gita (Chapter IV-7)... which translates to "Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself". Hmmm! :-)  I wonder what path the third movie will take!

       Who do we believe?!  Dr. Hans Blix seems to be taking on Bush and Blair as the  urlLink row over Iraq's weapons grows .  Dr Hans Blix said the secret info they gave didn't help him find any evidence that Saddam Hussein was developing illegal weapons. ...  Dr Blix said his team went to the places which were supposed to contain weapons - but they found nothing. ...  "Only in three of those cases did we find anything at all, and in none of the cases were there any weapons of mass destruction," he said.  This comes when British PM Tony Blair is facing hell about misleading the public over the alleged possession of WMDs by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. In particular, Blair's pre-war contention that Saddam could launch dooms-day weapons within 45 minutes, has come uder a lot of fire. So much so that Blair is now facing a  urlLink parliamentary probe  over his (mis)handling of intelligence reports about the existence of Iraqi WMDs.  On the other hand US President, George W Bush, has managed to steer clear of controversies as his popularity ratings have stayed high even as Blair is finding life tough in UK. But the Democrats are slowly drawing their knives out for him.  On a 'thank you' visit to Qatar, Bush  urlLink gave a speech to the troops  stationed there.  Speaking to troops in Qatar, Bush suggested it shouldn't be surprising that no such weapons have been found, despite the fall of Saddam's regime and the presence of coalition forces in Iraq for more than two months.   "This is a man who spent decades hiding tools of mass murder," Bush said. "He knew the inspectors were looking for them. You know better than me he's got a big country in which to hide them. We're on the look. We'll reveal the truth."   Also,  urlLink BBC reports ...  Greg Thielman, who was until September 2002 a top official in charge of non-proliferation and strategic affairs in the US state department's intelligence bureau, has expressed doubt over the objectivity of the US evidence presented to the world.   "Evidence has been distorted and the public has really been misled on issues that helped inform the decision about war and peace," he told the BBC's Today programme.

       urlLink Chemical Ali may still be alive   U.S. MILITARY officials told NBC News that they had changed the status of Ali Hassan al-Majid, the infamous Chemical Ali, suspected of ordering the 1988 gas attacks that killed thousands of Kurds in the northern Iraqi village of Halabja, from believed dead but unconfirmed to unknown.  Now this is interesting. The death of 'Chemical Ali' was touted as one of the major successes in the run up to the fall of Baghdad. Pentagon was sure that they had got their man when the military bombed his residence in early May. But CIA, it seems, had been insisting since early May that there was a 40 percent chance that man who gassed the Kurds might still be alive.   If thats the case with 'Chemical Ali', then I guess Saddam Hussein is sure to be alive. They were never certain about him anyways!   Theres nothing interesting here, just a lot of rubble,  said Pfc. Walter Phillips, 30, of Chicago, as he stood near his backhoe at the edge of a 15-foot crater.  Iraqis nearby doubted whether the soldiers would find the remains of Saddam, who they suspect was hiding at another house, just yards away.   No, no - Saddam ran away. Hes hiding,  said Munther Meki, a grocer whose shop  its front window gone and shelves empty  is next to the destroyed house.

      Google also jumps into the  distributed-computing-over-the-Net  fray with  urlLink The Google Compute Project . Its a feature of the Google Toolbar which utilizes the idle processing power of your computer (and other computers participating in the project) to perform calculations for a large research project.  The first beneficiary of this effort is  urlLink Folding@home , a non-profit academic research project at Stanford University that is trying to understand the structure of proteins so they can develop better treatments for a number of illnesses. In the future Google Compute may allow you to also donate your computing time to other  urlLink carefully selected  worthwhile endeavors, including projects to improve Google and its services.  The Google Compute feature of the Google Toolbar shouldn't affect your regular computing activities and you can easily disable it at any time for any reason.

       urlLink Indian researcher challenges Newton's law   An Indian research technologist in Australia has challenged Newton's First Law of Motion and called for a revision of the classical theory in the light of modern technology. Arindam Banerjee, an alumnus of Indian Institue of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur and now working for Telstra in Melbourne made this contention in his book, "To The Stars!".  For those who do not know Newton's First Law of Motion, it says, " Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it. ". This is also sometimes referred to as the "Law of Inertia". Using his unconventional theory, Banerjee has described in a technical paper, what he calls, a design for 'perpetual motion machines' which can generate energy without burning any kind of fossil fuel or any radioactive process.  The Internal Force Engine, which Banerjee has designed, never runs out of power because it is 'self charging' without the need for any external source of energy.

It has alarmed experts in First Amendment law, who say that such orders prohibiting future publication, prior restraints, are essentially unknown in American law. Moreover, they say, claims like Ms. Johnson's, for invasion of privacy, have almost never been considered enough to justify prior restraints.   link via  urlLink Metafilter   Even though this is a serious issue, especially for people who write on Net (like maintaining blogs), I think this is funny!!

       Why does everybody hate America? NY Times columnist Thomas Friedman attempts to analyze what is it that makes countries around the world hate America... especially now... after Afghanistan and Iraq. He comes up with  urlLink A Brief Theory of Everything   [NYTimes registration required] . And he makes some interesting and valid points. He claims after the fall of the Soviet Empire and the emergence of the Internet-technology revolution in America... The net effect was that U.S. power, culture and economic ideas about how society should be organized became so dominant (a dominance magnified through globalization) that America began to touch people's lives around the planet  "more than their own governments," as a Pakistani diplomat once said to me. Yes, we began to touch people's lives  directly or indirectly  more than their own governments.  This is quite true. I mean people around the world felt that they were losing control over how their lives are shaped not on a personal level but as the citizens of their respective countries. As a result, America came to be viewed as a hegemon trying to meddle in affairs not their own. This caused varying degrees of resentment in various countries around the world. While in some countries, anti-Americanism became a raison detre of that countrys existence, in other countries, like India, anti-Americanism was restricted largely to vitriolic pronouncements by the obsolete leftists and narrow-minded xenophobic policies of the ultra-nationalists.  Friedman also tries to explain why nations did not rise militarily against America. Why didn't nations organize militarily against the U.S.? Michael Mandelbaum, author of "The Ideas That Conquered the World," answers: "One prominent international relations school  the realists  argues that when a hegemonic power, such as America, emerges in the global system other countries will naturally gang up against it. But because the world basically understands that America is a benign hegemon, the ganging up does not take the shape of warfare. Instead, it is an effort to Gulliverize America, an attempt to tie it down, using the rules of the World Trade Organization or U.N.  and in so doing demanding a vote on how American power is used."  That is an interesting metaphor... Gulliverizing!! :-)  Friedman says that he will try to refine this theory ( though, I don't really think that this is a new theory! ) and come out with sequels to this article. Lets see... at least this article was balanced and rational.

      Those who have seen Powai lake recently will testify to the fact that it is much too polluted. As a result, apparently the fish in the lake have started choking to death. But when the engineer in the Hydraulic Department of BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Anand Deodhar, was asked " urlLink Why are there dead fish in Powai lake? ", the answer he gave was imaginative to say the least!  If you thought the fish in Powai lake were choking to death because of pollutants, think again. Apparently, theyre all committing a unique kind of suicide: by diving out of the water like dolphins and dashing their heads on rocks.  Sounds far-fetched? Not to the hydraulic department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) that cited this reason, along with others, for the dying fish.  Trust the brains in BMC to come up with such "ground-breaking research"!!

       urlLink 'Outsourcing a problem for US firms, not India'  says deputy PM LK Advani as he put forth a sound argument for the same.  "I had no such intention because when any company in America, or Britain or Germany, decides to ask Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys Technologies or any other Indian firm to help it as far as outsourcing is concerned, it (the US company) does so for its own commercial gains," Advani said.  "It (the US company) is not in any way helping India. Its objective is not to help India or to help that (Indian) company. No. So if any US state feels this is not in its interest, let them take a decision," he argued. Well said, Mr. Advani!! I'm glad you did not "plead" on this issue.  But now... can you do the same on the cross-border terrorism issue? Please cut out the pleadings and start fighting our wars on our own!

       Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  -  Reviewed Lets see how HP5 fares at the hands of the critics...   urlLink NY Times feels Harry Potter loses his innocence in this book   This Harry Potter is less Prince Hal than a budding Henry V; less the callow boy in "The Sword in the Stone" and more of the young King Arthur.  A considerably darker, more psychological book than its predecessors, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" occupies the same emotional and storytelling place in the Potter series as "The Empire Strikes Back" held in the first "Star Wars" trilogy. It provides a sort of fulcrum for the series, marking Harry's emergence from boyhood, and his newfound knowledge that an ancient prophecy holds the secret to Voldemort's obsession with him and his family.  urlLink BBC says Rowling has brought the magic of reading to a global audience  Rowling's magical formula, so hard to replicate, is that she can keep the reader - whether young or old - enthralled.  The pages seem to turn themselves as though some unseen force drives us through the book.    urlLink The Globe and Mail says the Phoenix rises to expectations  Flashy, fast-paced, but a little flabby, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is here  all 766 pages of it.  The most anticipated book of the summer, Phoenix, the fifth book in J. K. Rowling's celebrated series of novels about an orphaned wizard raised in the home of the Dursleys  that beastly suburban family of muggles  lives up to its advance press.  urlLink The Age says its pretty gripping and the best so far!  Phew! What a read this book is! After reading 300 pages of the 766-page book, I'm pushing myself to type this review because I want to go back to the gripping story  urlLink Edmonton Journal declares it to be worth every minute of wait  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -- the eagerly awaited fifth instalment of J.K. Rowling's revered Harry Potter series -- is as creative, engrossing and satisfying as any Potter fan could hope.    Now... only if Fabmart could deliver the book to me!! I'm fuming right now!!! x-(

In  urlLink Of Cards - Credit and Debit types  [scroll down to the bottom of the page for the post. Dated 16 June 2003],  urlLink Lazy Lump  talks about how we take credit and debit cards for granted nowadays.   urlLink Nilesh  is perplexed about why the  urlLink Women of the species  are not active in hacking (hacking, not cracking).

Shanti talks about the  urlLink Muslim Personal Law  and the reluctance of Muslims to reconcile to the idea of having an Uniform Civil Code in India.   urlLink Ind  posts an informative post on the  urlLink Flag Code of India .

      SCO seems to be growing too big for its boots. It has gone on criticizing almost everybody connected with Linux and in the latest court document it has presented,  urlLink SCO criticizes Linus Torvalds   SCO's amended suit against I.B.M., filed late Monday, contends that Mr. Torvalds, who has overseen the development of Linux, appears to have a casual attitude toward intellectual property rights. Linux is distributed free and improved upon by a far-flung network of developers. SCO harps on the fact that Linus has, in the past, spoken freely against the concept of software patents. As a result, SCO contends that Linus is unwilling/inable to identify the IPR origins of the contributed source code that has gone in towards the development of Linux.  But Linus, candid as ever, has been known to pooh-pooh the concept of IPRs and patents on software. "I do not look up any patents on principle because (a) it's a horrible waste of time and (b) I don't want to know."  "The fact is technical people are better off not looking at patents. If you don't know what they cover and where they are, you won't be knowingly infringing on them," In any case, I'm sure that the open source community that has been involved in development of Linux will be up in arms against SCO ( it already is! ). And that's because, SCO has dared to speak against their "God"!!

       urlLink RIAA Prepares To Sue Hundreds Of File Sharers   The RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) have today (June 26th) begun gathering evidence and preparing lawsuits against individual computer users who are illegally offering to "share" substantial amounts of copyrighted music over peer-to-peer networks.   To gather evidence against P2P users who make illegal downloading possible, the RIAA will be using software that scans the public directories available to any user of a peer-to-peer network. These directories, which allow users to find the material they are looking for, list all the files that other users of the network are currently offering to distribute. When the software finds a user who is offering to distribute copyrighted music files, it downloads some of the infringing files, along with the date and time it accessed the files.  Draconian, I say!!  The Ministry of Magic is spreading its tentacles!!! It must be stopped!!

       Indiatimes is Connecting people...  One of my colleagues wants to buy a new cell-phone. He's bored with his Siemens C35. So, yesterday he decided to check out a few new models and their prices. So he hopped over to the  urlLink Indiatimes Auctions  site since he was not averse to buying a second-hand piece.  He was looking for a Nokia model. I suggested  urlLink Nokia 3650 , just because of its unconventional looks and colour display. He liked it but he kept on searching some more.  That is when he landed up on an  urlLink auction  for the stunning  urlLink Nokia 6800 . It was going for Rs. 36000. My colleague had never seen this particular model before so he read through all the impressive features that 6800 boasted. At the end of the features-list was the customary link to the picture of the piece being auctioned. It said, ' urlLink see picture '. Click on it to see this strange Nokia 'model'.  Boy!... if I get one of those, I sure don't know which are the right buttons to push!

      One more post about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. You might feel I'm going overboard (and crazy) about the bespectacled wizard ( with the lightening shaped scar on his forehead, if I may add!) ). But then, isn't everyone?!  Barnes & Noble, the largest US bookseller said on Sunday that the weekend sales figures of HP5 were on course to top 1 million copies (??!!!). They had anticipated a sale of 1 million copies by the end of the first week. But the rate of 80 copies per second ensured that the 1 million mark would be achieved in the first 48 hours alone!  Tesco Supermarket in the UK is supposed to be the biggest single outlet for HP5. It had sold more than 300,000 copies in the 24 hours after the launch. Tesco had sold about 42,000 copies of HP4 in the first week after its launch. So... compare for yourself!  Ok, get those sales figures out of your heads and check this  urlLink review of the book.   [link via  urlLink Instapundit ]  It claims that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has Libertarian overtones to it! I'm on page 550 of Book Five, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  It's an excellent read, and the only reason I'm putting the book down to blog is because I can barely contain my enthusiasm about this --  I can't believe the overwhelming  libertarian  overtones in this book! Before you read the review, I must warn you that though there are no spoilers mentioned, there are still some plot details included in the review.  But like all the reviews that I've read so far, the review ends with...  I finally finished the book, and I highly recommend it.  Amazingly, and despite my previous assumptions, the series is getting better and better as it continues. Oh well! Now I HAVE to start the book ASAP!!

       urlLink Reaching Through the Net to Touch   Researchers at the University at Buffalo, New York, announced last week they have developed a system that lets one person experience the sense of touch felt by another. They said they could transmit the sensation across the Internet.  In about five years, people may use the system to feel the force and pressure Tiger Woods experiences every time he wallops a golf ball. It could be used in e-commerce, enabling buyers to feel fabrics before they buy...  Hmmm... and not just that. Maybe a gentle touch by that special someone too!  What's more, the sensory data can be saved, allowing one sensation to be accessed indefinitely.  So that you can feel that special first touch years later when you are relaxing in your easy-chair with your dentures in a glass of water on the table nearby!! *Heh*   But then... you wouldn't want to use this technology if you are a regular in adult chatrooms!! :-P

       urlLink Sex at 60 mph is OK in Germany   Having sex while driving at 100 kph (60 mph) down a motorway is not an offence in Germany. But if you hit something make sure you don't run off. ... "The man was convicted of hit-and-run and sentenced to a fine of 600 euros," court spokesman Juergen Mannebeck said on Tuesday. "It's hard to believe but in fact no law was broken with the intercourse on the motorway. It's a situation lawmakers never thought about."  Ahem Ahem!! LOL!!  The courts worldwide, are an endless source of mirth!!

       urlLink Behold the pentaquark    Physicists have discovered a new class of subatomic particle that will provide unexpected insights into the fundamental building blocks of matter.  ...  The new particle is the so-called pentaquark - five quarks in formation. Until now, physicists had only seen quarks packed into two- or three-quark combinations ...  The discovery of the pentaquark, also known as a new exotic baryon state, should have far-reaching consequences for our theory of particle interactions that attempt to explain the structure of matter.

       urlLink Bloggers Gain Libel Protection  This is a victory for free speech advocates and also for bloggers... well, at least in the US!  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last Tuesday that Web loggers, website operators and e-mail list editors can't be held responsible for libel for information they republish, extending crucial First Amendment protections to do-it-yourself online publishers.   Online free speech advocates praised the decision as a victory. The ruling effectively differentiates conventional news media, which can be sued relatively easily for libel, from certain forms of online communication such as moderated e-mail lists. One implication is that DIY publishers like bloggers cannot be sued as easily.

       Now you see it, now you don't!  That's how the template of this blog (hosted on  urlLink Blog*Spot  and obviously powered by  urlLink Blogger ) has been behaving in the past few days.  It all started when Blogger took that momentous step towards moving all its users over to  urlLink Dano . I was surprised to see the Dano interface on my non-Dano blog and took me a few moments to realize that Blogger had started the migration.  All seemed good. I tried to post an entry on Friday morning. Thats when I realized something was amiss because I just could not publish my blog. So, I tried to find the error details and saw that my template had disappeared completely. The template box was empty... nice and clean!  There have been times in the past when the template has looked funny. But that has been when the folks at Blogger were probably doing some routine maintenance work. But this time the template had disappeared completely. Even so, I waited half a day for it to re-appear as magically as it had vanished! But being a Muggle, magic was obviously out of the question!  So I went to  urlLink Control  and lodged a complaint quoting the error I was getting while publishing the blog and explaining that my template had vanished into thin air of the cyberspace. But it has been more than 72 hours since I entered my complaint and the status of the complaint still shows " Unreviewed " which is just a euphemism for " nobody has given a shit's worth of attention to the complaint ".  So today, I built up my blog's template from an old backup that I had kept. ( foresightedness at its shining best! ). But only a few minutes after that, my template disappeared again! If this is what the new Dano experience is all about... spare me folks! I'll move over to Movable Type ( which I'm going to do in about a month's time, anyways! ).  I advise all you Blogger users to take backups of your templates immediately and keep taking backups when you make any changes to the template. I believe even  urlLink Anita  had a scary experience, a couple of weeks back, when her template vanished. So... chant the backup mantra to be safe!  So it was template rebuilding time for me today. And while I was at it, I made a few changes to the template...  I added a dotted line between posts to act as a divider since it was often confusing to differentiate between posts on my blog.  I changed the "New Post" indicator which indicates that a blog has nad a new entry posted to it ( duh! ). The new indicator is tinier and not-so-distracting as the last one I was using.  And the most important update I made was the addition of the  urlLink Sideblog . You can see it just below on the zonkboard on the right hand column. Sideblog is a tiny blog just like the one they have on... ummm... Metafilter for example. I'll be using the Sideblog to make announcements and/or to post some special links or... errr.... well, ok! I haven't thought of a use for it yet. But it's a nice tool and I'll put it to good use! :-)  Well, that's about it for the moment!

      I was on a whirlwind tour of all the blogs on my blogroll ( been a long time since I did that, actually! ). I'm linking some of the interesting posts that I encountered...  Shanti  ponders over  the very concept of religion. I'm sure there will be a good amount of discussion on this one. :-)  Dina  talks  about some of the wonders of blogs.   Ravikiran  looks beneath the surface  of the currently raging Cola controversy. Anita on the other hand  wonders at the fuss  that is being created. She quotes an article from the Times which indicates the impurities that our daily foodstuffs may contain. ( Icecream, they say, may contain washing powder!!... No wonder I feel washed out... both, on the inside as well as in my wallet, when I have icecream!! )  Arun has an  interesting anecdote  which illustrates why the practice of filling out feedback forms in restaurants is useless.  Gaurav seems to be in a pretty  poetic/ shayaraana  mood  these days! :-)  Rohini's  post   informed me  that yesterday (13 th  August) was Left-Handers' Day!! So, in case you are a left-handed person, let me take this opportunity to wish you (albeit, belatedly) A Happy Left-Handers' Day!! :-D Do you know that while a right-handed person uses more of the left-side of the brain, the left-handed people use both the hemispheres of the brain more or less to equal quantities. Also, since the left side of the body is controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain, left-handed people make more use of the right side of the brain than their right-handed counterparts. The right-hemisphere of the brain controls creativity and intelligence. :-)  Deepali  muses  a little about drain-drain and brain-gain before ending the post with a lovely poem.  Ahem!... this turned out to be something like a personal Blog Mela. * LOL * But its essentially just a round up of today's (or yesterday's at the most!) posts from the people who are on my blogroll. By the way, I'm going to revamp the blogroll and remove the dead-links and update the wrong ones. Drop me a comment if you wanna be on my blogroll and aren't already there! ;-)

      A couple of days back, I got a mail from one of my school friends, who lives in California. He was excited about Arnold Schwarzenneger deciding to put his hat in the gubernatorial ring. He loved the fact that Arnie chose to announce his candidature on Jay Leno's show.  Even though my knowledge of American politics is lesser than rudimentary, I replied to his mail ( which was actually on our school's e-group ). Here's that mail. Pardon my lack of grasp of power politics if it seems naive...  When you have a gubernatorial candidate announcing his candidature in a standup comedy show, you know why people say politics is becoming a circus nowadays.  Add to that a list of candidates that boasts of a " smut peddler with a heart " (Larry Flynt), a " pornstar who wants to replace guns with X-Rated movies " (Mary Carey),  a feisty columnist (Arianna Huffington), a " billboard icon " (Angelyne), a " 26-year-old software engineer who sells thong underwear as her campaign mechandise " (Georgy Russell), etc. They also have a couple of candidates who are named Bob Dole and Michael Jackson !! ( not the real things though )  With a circus like this, I guess California leaves behind even Florida ( remember the last Presidential elections... the one that manipulated George W Bush into the White House ).  I guess its " Hasta La Vista, Baby!! " to sanity which leaves the state without saying " I'll be back!! "  Indian elections see lots of circuses too... mostly with the clown acts, but this California thing is turning into an international farce!

      Hizbul Mujaheedin chief Syed Salahuddin has  urlLink urged Kashmiri Pandits to return to their homes  in Jammu and Kashmir.  The outfit promised 'protection' to them.  "They should return home and Allah willing the Mujahedeen (warriors) would provide them all possible protection," Hizbul chief Syed Salahuddin said at a meeting in Muzzaffarabad on Monday.   Strange, isn't it?! Syed Salahuddin is offering protection to the Pandits. But who is he going to offer protection from?? ...   Ahh! the terrorists!!... how silly of me!   But then,, isn't Hizbul Mujahideen a terrorist organization?!!   * confused *   Seriously speaking, the whole thing has to do with the position of Hijbul Mujahideen (HM) in the Kashmir valley. After years of funding and backing by Pakistan's ISI, HM is now without a backing except by its mother organization Jamaat-e-Islaami. The ISI prefers the Jaish-e-Mohammad in addition to the mercenary outfits like Lashkar-e-Toiba and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. With the ISI taps running dry and Pakistan Government putting a squeeze on Jamaat-e-Islaami, HM's funding has been severely affected.   HM has always been pro-Pakistan organization which advocates Kashmir's union with Pakistan. This has been the bone of contention between it and other pro-independence organizations like JKLF. Also, HM wants American intervention in the Kashmir dispute while organizations like Hurriyat are dead against it.  So Hizbul Mujahideen is essentially a spent force with a divided leadership. Its call to the Pandits to return to their homes is nothing but empty rhetoric and is inconsistent with their known idealogy. And unless majority of terrorist outfits do not give guarantees ( which is a highly improbable event ) for their safety, the return of Kashmiri Pandits to the valley may well start off another gruesome round of "ethnic cleansing".

      This is an interesting concept that Mahindra-British Telecom ( the company I work for ) has introduced in an Indian corporate. They've recruited the services of John Buchanan, the Australian cricket team coach to offer "training and mentoring guidance   urlLink Buchanan to grind CEOs   MBT, a joint venture between Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and British Telecom, wants Australia cricket coach John M. Buchanan to grind its executives into match-winners.  Management lessons appear to cut no ice in the cut-throat business world of competition anymore.

      NY Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman recounts his  urlLink chance encounter  with Ayatollah Khomeini's grandson at a dinner in Iraq.  As we sat down for a meal of Iraqi fish and flat bread, he introduced me to a small, black-turbaned cleric who was staying as his houseguest.  "Mr. Friedman, this is Sayyid Hussein Khomeini"  the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of Iran's Islamic revolution.  Now, something like this just before a quiet dinner would spoil my appetite. But that's just me! ;-)  In any case, Sayyid Hussein Khomeini isn't in the same mould as his grandfather. He may have  Ayatollah Khomeini's fiery eyes and steely determination  (Friedman's description), but he is as liberal a Muslim as you'll get in the Arab world.  The 46-year-old Mr. Khomeini said he's currently advocating a national referendum in Iran to revoke the absolute religious and political powers that have been grabbed by Iran's clergy. But in other interviews here, he was quoted as saying that Iran's hard-line clerical rulers were "the world's worst dictatorship," who have been exploiting his grandfather's name and the name of Islam "to continue their tyrannical rule."  Now, doesn't that come as a breath of fresh air from the mouth of a Muslim cleric ( and I'm not referring to the breath, which would not have been smelling anything like fresh air after a hearty meal consisting of Iraqi fish ).  This dinner was being enjoyed at the house of another Shiite cleric by the name of Sayyid Iyad Jamaleddine, who like the young Khomeini is a liberal Muslim. His views on religion and state are particularly heartening  "We want a secular constitution. That is the most important point. If we write a secular constitution and separate religion from state, that would be the end of despotism and it would liberate religion as well as the human being. . . . The Islamic religion has been hijacked for 14 centuries by the hands of the state. The state dominated religion, not the other way around. It used religion for its own ends. Tyrants ruled this nation for 14 centuries and they covered their tyranny with the cloak of religion. . . . When I called for secularism in Nasiriya (in the first postwar gathering of Iraqi leaders), they started saying things against me. But last week I had some calls from Qum, thanking me for presenting this thesis and saying, `We understand what you are calling for, but we cannot say so publicly.'  "Secularism is not blasphemy. I am a Muslim. I am devoted to my religion. I want to get it back from the state and that is why I want a secular state. . . . When young people come to religion, not because the state orders them to but because they feel it themselves in their hearts, it actually increases religious devotion. . . . The problem of the Middle East cannot be solved unless all the states in the area become secular. . . . I call for opening the door for Ijtihad [reinterpretation of the Koran in light of changing circumstances]. The Koran is a book to be interpreted [by] each age. Each epoch should not be tied to interpretations from 1,000 years ago. We should be open to interpretations based on new and changing times."  Now only if someone explained that to our politicians... and the so-called guardians of secularism in India ( I'm referring to the the separation of the religion and the state ), though I know that will never happen!  Seriously though, now that Iraq has been sorted out... and the rebuilding underway, US should give some serious thought to using people like these clerics to promote change and real democracy in Iran... rather than using force or coercion. A religious revolution is needed... from within.  The reason why I say this is that we've seen in Iraq that all it takes is to lop off the top layer of leadership. Wrecking the whole structure of the establishment does not help... in fact it backfires. People have a natural affinity for democracy. So, once the top layer of the leadership is dislodged, either by the use of external force like the one in Iraq or by the way of popular uprising initiated by people with progressive ideals like the two Sayyids, the winds of change start blowing. The good thing about a popular uprising is that the question of an alternative governing body is as good as solved. While this is over-simplifying things, I think this is the way to go in Iran.  Are Khomeini, Jamaleddine and GW Bush game for this?   [link requires free NYTimes registration]

      Well ok... I had to eat my words about India losing against the in-form Pakistani side in their Champions Trophy match yesterday. But, given the kind of win that India pulled off against their traditional rivals, I'll gladly eat my words!!  I reached home, after office, to find my excited dad at the door. He told me excitedly that it was 4-4 with 15 minutes to go in the second half. I flung my bag and sat in front of the TV.  And, it was wonderful!! ... two superb backhand flicks by Gagan Ajit Singh gave India an almost unassailable lead. And then Dhanraj Pillay's brilliant run down the right flank ended in the 7th goal by Deepak Thakur. Pakistan were dead and buried by that time. And India had scored 5 goals in the second half to Pakistan's 1. It was a famous win!! I was almost whooping with excitement as goals rained.  And now today... Australia have thrashed Argentina 8-3. This means that India is still in the contention for a medal. India will (I think) play Pakistan again to decide the bronze medal winner. Now  that ... is a match to watch!!  But just to take some wind out of the sails, I would like to remind that the game yesterday (Ind V Pak) was such a brilliant game just because it had two Asian teams playing the Asian flavour of the game i.e. free flowing hockey. Tight man-marking was conspicuous by its absence. This essentially allowed the teams to play freely... which is why we had piercing runs by the forwards of both the teams... and hence the flurry of goals. The Europeans play a different kind of game. They restrict the free movement of players that the Asians love so much. This results in stifling the Indians who then start going in for long passes and overhead balls... which leads nowhere and turns the possession over to the opposing team.  The Indian team, the captain and the coach included, should be well-advised not to let the win go to their heads. They should instead grab at this sliver of a chance to salvage a medal out of this Champions Trophy by repeating the tough-as-nails performance against Pakistan when they meet the next time around in the tournament.

      Looking at the performance of the Indian Hockey team in the Champions Trophy in Amstelveen, I wonder what went wrong!  After a string of impressive performances, the team even got Sahara India as the sponsors... a noteworthy achievement for any sport other than cricket, in India. But looking at the team perform in the Champions Trophy, I just wonder where is all the confidence and skill that helped them win two international tournaments in the recent past.  All the sports decry the attention that cricket gets in India. But what they fail to acknowledge is the fact that the cricketers are always under tremendous pressure to perform and yet they deliver the goods most of the times against the best in the game. This hockey team was under certain pressure to perform given their impressive recent record. And they crumbled in a grand fashion. The pressure got to them!! It was there for all to see... live on TV... how they were high-strung in all their games. The fear of losing was inhibiting them. The expectations proved too much for a team not equipped to handle such pressures.  I can understand a shock defeat to Holland in a match that the Indians controlled for all of 63 minutes without conceding a goal. But in the very next match, a second-string development side from Germany managed to hold the Indians at bay till the last moments of the match before the Indians managed to save their face. The next loss to Australia could also be forgiven considering the strength of the Australian side. But the match against Argentina that came next should have been an easy one. Argentina, while a good side, is certainly not a major force. But the Indians played pathetically to lose the match.  The next match is against Pakistan on Friday and I don't see India winning given their current form, or the lack of it, and the great form of the Pakistani team. If they lose, the Indians will have a playoff match to decide the last two places... certainly not the result expected from this Champions Trophy!!  Individual brilliance and selfish play will never benefit in a team game. Indians stick to the old formula of brilliant solo runs down the flanks while the need of the hour on the astro-turf pitches is that of extreme speed and short passing, something that the Indian team sadly did not seem to grasp. Moreover, the individual brilliance of wizards like Dhanraj Pillay is wasted due to the crowding tactics employed by the opposition.  Anyways... I could go on and on and on...  But tell me one thing... who was that brilliant chap who decided to have the preparation and conditioning camp for the Champions Trophy, to be played at Amstelveen which is below sea-level, at a place in Himachal Pradesh that is about 6600 feet above sea-level?!! :-o

      World Markets Research Centre ( urlLink WMRC ) has published the inaugural  urlLink WMRC Global Terrorism Index . This index apparently assesses the risk of terrorism in 186 countries and against these countries' interests abroad, and ranks them.  The hard copy of the rankings is available for USD 1500 (!!!). But they gave some information during their press release.  Check  urlLink this  out for further details.  Colombia tops the list with Israel following close behind. Pakistan comes in at no. 3 while the mighty US of A is ranked as the 4th riskiest country in the world as far as terrorist threats are concerned. Phillipines follows next while UK is housed at No. 10 (not Downing street!)  No information is available about India, which means it does not figure prominently in the top spots... which is good! But I wonder how many terrorist attacks has Pakistan had to suffer in recent times?! Or... Colombia for that matter!!   [link via  urlLink Metafilter ]

      I saw  urlLink this post  on  urlLink Metafilter  about the  urlLink Landmark Education Corporation  and was reminded of a close friend calling me up one day and broaching the subject of a "wonderful transformation" that had occurred in him recently. Naturally, I was interested in what he was saying. He said about how we are insincere in our relationships and how we alone can make our relationships work.  After beating around the bush for a few more minutes, he told me about something known as The Landmark Forum. He gave me sketchy details about what the forum was all about and asked me to accompany him as his guest for a guest session one evening. He also told me how his parents had taken the course too.  Now, I detest all these so called self-help or self-improvement thingies. The prime reason is that if you need someone else to help you do it... then it no longer is "self" improvement, is it?! So, I did not commit and just let the matter hang. I did not refuse outright because I could feel that my friend was pretty passionate about this thing. My friend did not press on further. But he started calling me regularly after that. Each time he would ask me if I could join him for the guest session.  But once I decide to do something... I can be pretty stubborn at times. So, many calls later, I guess my friend took the hint and stopped asking me for the Landmark Forum session.  And now... today, I read about some of the  urlLink feedback  by those who attended the Landmark Forum and I was shocked!!  While its true that it "may have" helped lakhs of people worldwide, I'm glad I didn't go for it!! The accompanying risk (that I now discovered existed) just wasn't worth it.

      A former US Congressman who is supposed to have played a major role in the CIA operations in Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation has revealed, in his book titled,  Charlie Wilson's War , that  urlLink Ronald Reagan looked the other way when Zia-ul Haq went about acquiring nuclear weapons . The logic behind letting this happen was simple, according to the book. If Zia did not help the US on the Afghanistan issue...  "The Afghan resistance would collapse. The Soviets would triumph. The Zia government would disappear and be replaced by an anti-American one in Pakistan armed with a nuclear weapon" So, in effect the Americans armed Pakistan with nukes because they were afraid Pakistan would get the nukes from somewhere else.

         Here we are! Back again with the all-singing, all-dancing show called the  Bharateeya Blog Mela . And can you believe it... this is the 26th edition of the Mela!! Which means that it has been around for over 6 months now!! :-)  Let's get straight to the point. The biggest event this week was one of the saddest days in Mumbai's recent history. And it's not surprising that the shockwaves of the Mumbai Bomb Blasts were felt through the Blog world too. As a result, posts related to the blasts and the subsequent opinions merit a separate post altogether.  Yazad  will be hosting a round-up of the posts about the Mumbai bomb blasts, this weekend.  So, on with the Mela...  	  Yazad  notices a  political banner  that uses language one would not expect to see in serious political slogans. I wonder if anyone actually clicked a snap of that banner!  	  Shanti  posts about  an Associated Press news article  that curiously traces the root cause of the Mumbai blasts to the Hindu-Muslim riots in the 1940s, events that led to the partition of India. Clearly, the author of that AP article needs to read a chapter from an elementary school history book to understand that partition caused riots and not the other way round!  	  Niraj  cautions against the recent trend in some midwestern American cities, of accepting  illegal immigration  without the apparent consent of the US federal government.  	  Jivha  unearths a small newsitem that announces a BESCOM decision which is actually  an encroachment on our personal freedom .  	  JK  posts a detailed  book review  of "Fast Food Nation"... a book that he found " very gripping and interesting to listen ".  	 It's  JK  once more, as he is fascinated by a new archaelogical discovery that unravels some more facts about  Ancient India .  	  Smorgasbord  lists some of Mr. Christopher Hitchins' accusations against Mother Teresa in his post titled  Saints and Sinners ... accusations that try to " blazon her carefully crafted image of piety ".  	 Another post by  Jivha  finds a mention in the Mela. Here, he cautions against  revising history  as he wonders why, in the first place, did the Allahabad High Court ask the ASI to carry out excavations at the disputed site in Ayodhya.  	  Sandeep  has a detailed post about the de-merits of urbanization and its effects on the  Rural Indian Economy .  	  Radhika Nair  posts about an encounter with drunks that gets her thinking about how some  Britons feel insecure due to the immigrants .   	  Srijith  posts about the   Urdhva Tiryagbhyam   which is an extremely easy formula in Vedic Mathematics that simplifies all cases of multiplication. It really is amazing!!  	  Parag  has a  post  about earth's close encounter with Mars. He even has a photo on the post.    And that... is a round up of some of the interesting posts that have appeared on the Indian Blogscape in the past few days. I hope you enjoyed going through these wonderful posts.  My thanks to Shanti, JK, Ashwini, Yazad and Parag for sending in nominations for the Mela!! :-)

      I know I'm late in posting this, but I shall post it nonetheless. Arun Shourie's three-part series of articles in The Indian Express that is an absolute MUST-READ. Read it!!... if you haven't done so already!!   Part 1 :   urlLink Before the whining drowns it out, listen to the new India  And guess what the average age is in the industry? Just 26 and a half! These 26/27-year-olds have changed the worlds perception of India. Its not just a country of snake-charmers, its a country against which protectionist walls have to be erected. Of course, we can also charm snakes.   Part 2 :   urlLink When sky is the limit  The point is the successes we have encountered above are not fortuitous. India has a score of strengths that others do not.  Cost is one of them. Nor is it a marginal advantage. Indeed, the difference between the cost at which we can provide services and many commodities of comparable quality and what those cost in the developed world is so vast that, should those firms and economies shut themselves out from our supplies, they are the ones who will be severely disadvantaged, they are the ones who will be making themselves un-competitive.   Part 3 :   urlLink This is India's moment but it's onle a moment, can we grasp it?   So we have many things working for us. In many ways, this is Indias moment, even vis a vis China. For the first time, observers have begun to voice questions in public about Chinaits statistics; the fact, for instance, as a German investor said recently at a conference I was deputed to attend, that, If you want your factory to come up quickly, go to China; if you want to make money, go to India. On the other side, everyones noticing Indians make a mark in every sphere: writers, scientists, doctors, IT, cricket, beauty pageants, chess...  So it is the moment for India. It is a moment. But, it is only a moment. What should we do to ensure we grasp it?

      Forensic experts from The State Forensic Laboratory have concluded that  urlLink RDX was used in the blasts  that shook Mumbai on the 25 th  of August, 2003. Now, this certainly means that these blasts were much similar to the 1993 blasts than the ones that have rocked Mumbai in recent months. The Ghatkopar, Mulund, Vile Parle blasts used crude explosives

      This is really interesting.  urlLink Former top cops give their views on two B's... Blasts and Bhujbal . And it seems that all of them except Rebeiro speak like the politicians that they serve.  On being asked, " How do you rate the performance of the police with respect to the blasts? "...  some of them have given some answers that are worth scoffing at...   Sahney:  I will not blame police. This is a phenomenon that will not stop as long as there are angry people bearing grudges.  Ohh! ... then why have the police at all?! ... Maybe we should have counsellors instead... or meditation courses for these angry people. Maybe that would reduce the terrorist activities.   Soman:  I dont find anything objectionable. In a city like Mumbai with a population of 1.10 crore, its difficult for a police force of 40,000 to know everything.  Well... I do concede that there's an iota of truth in what he says... but then Hello Mr. Soman... police need to know most of these things. That's why its called " intelligence "!! Otherwise why would we need police??!  Rebeiro hits the nail right on the head when he says, " They should have more contacts at the grassroots level, because intelligence comes from there. ". Now that's common sense stuff. But sadly, its lacking these days. Gone are the days when Mumbai police were the finest in the world. The network of informants that the police maintained then, was huge and almost legendary. But with the passage of time, the job of police was diluted by the politicians. VIP duty meant that the police were guarding the lives of wretched politicians instead of crime detection and prevention. With proximity to the politicians, came frequent contacts with the high flying dons of the underworld. Thus, the grassroots-level informer network was neglected to a large extent. And the word on the street was no longer heard by the police.   Coming back to the point...  On being asked about Chhagan Bhujbal's (Maharashtra Dy. Chief Minister) performance, most of the former top cops refused to comment. Rebeiro however openly said that " This is the worst administration as far as police is concerned. ". He also gave Bhujbal a 'zero' on a scale of one to ten!!  That says a lot, doesn't it?!

       Blast Updates:    urlLink Police hunting for the 'family' of four.    Two men in jeans accompanied by a woman and a child are the main suspects in yesterday twin blasts that killed 49 people, injured 161 and struck terror in the heart of an already jumpy city.  But Shivnarayan Pandey, driver of taxi, numbered MH-02-R-2007, that was used in the Gateway blast, had  urlLink apparently already sold his taxi seven months ago , according to his relatives. Pandey was supposed to be working in a private company as a driver. Why then was he driving that taxi??  And then... why was a taxi allowed to park in a MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) pay-and-park facility? Taxis aren't allowed to park in these pay-and-park area operated by the BMC.  The police seem to be a confused lot. While Police commissioner, R S Sharma, refused to divulge the names of organizations that may have been behind yesterday's blasts, Joint Commissioner, Dr. Satyapal Singh openly said, " urlLink These blasts are the work of Lashkar-e-Taiba and SIMI (Students Islamic Movement of India. "  The people of Mumbai have, as always, bounced right back, refusing to be cowed down. Whether this is resilience or apathy... one thing is certain. The spirit that keeps Mumbai ticking has not died down. An example of that resilience is the fact that the Sensex, which plumetted 120 points during the day yesterday, after the news of the blasts broke... has bounced back by regaining most of the lost ground. The sensex was 108 points up from yesterday's close at the time I posted this entry.  As a mark of condolence for those who've suffered in the blast, all of us at my workplace shall observe a minute of silence at 3 PM IST.

      There have been  urlLink four blasts in Mumbai  [ see updates below for the latest news ]. Looks like the cowardly bastards who have no balls to come out into the open have struck again! :-(   Update:  It seems the blasts happened just minutes after it was disclosed that the  urlLink ASI report indicates that there existed a temple  at the disputed site in Ayodhya. Interesting!!   Update No. 2:  The police now say that there were in fact  only two blasts  in the city today... not 4 as earlier reported. Strange!   Update No. 3:  After intial reports that about 6 to 10 people had died in the blasts, I just refreshed the page and was shocked to see that the official figures put the number of dead at  42  and the number of injured at over  150 !!!  The blasts have happened in South Mumbai this time. If the last few blasts were aimed at creating a sense of fear and panic among the common people of Mumbai ( by targetting public transport like trains and buses ),  I'm afraid the target this time around seems to be sending a forceful message to the Government that the terrorists are here.. right at their doorsteps.... and they aren't afraid of anything. Well, at least the Gateway of India blast was definitely to achieve this particular aim. Reports indicate that it was a very powerful blast.  urlLink Click here  for an image of the mangled remains of a car from the parking lot, near the Gateway, in which this blast occurred.  The second blast occurred in the crowded locality of Zaveri Bazar in Kalbadevi which is a  predominantly Gujarati locality . And I don't think this is a co-incidence. Moreover, these blasts in South Mumbai also aim to target the financial nerve centre of the metropolis which is not far away from the scene of these blasts. Not since the infamous Bombay Blasts 10 years ago, has the south of Mumbai been singed by the flames of terrorism.   It's terrible!!  Who is to blame for these incidents? Terrorists??... "Foreign (Pakistani) Hand"??... the government??... the police??  What are your thoughts?

      In his column, 'The Parting Shot' in Mid-Day, Anil Thakraney writes about  urlLink Media's 'Black Monday' . In it, he wonders about the media apathy as the terrible tragedy in Daman was largely ignored by a media dazzled by the high-profile terrorist bombings in Mumbai and the much-publicized elimination of Ghazi Baba, two events that occured on either side of the Daman tragedy.  This sort of a contradiction hugely benefits two parties: One, the terrorists, who ADORE the media for giving their hard work so much attention. And two, the public servants responsible for the poor maintenance of the Daman bridge. They, too, must LOVE the media. For exactly the opposite reason.  Touch!  Time, surely, for some introspection by the media!!

      If you want an example of putting one's foot in the mouth, look no further! It seems that the "freedom fighters" like the taste of their feet...  On saturday, after he was gunned down after a 11-hour long battle, the Jaish-e-Mohammad spokesman gave a statement that " urlLink Ghazi Baba is not dead ", and that the Indian BSF's claim was " a bundle of lies ".  But then on Sunday, some arrested JeM terrorists were shown his body and they  urlLink identified the slain militant as Ghazi Baba .  And then finally, on Monday, BSF intercepted a radio broadcast by JeM which announced, in Pakistan, that " urlLink The beat of our hearts, the crown of our heads, our beloved commander Ghazi Baba and his deputy have left... May god accept their sacrifice. "  Putting the foot in the mouth... JeM style!

      Former Special Secretary of RAW (India's external intelligence agency), V Balachandran, asserts that  urlLink 'Police intelligence in Mumbai is very poor' . He also goes on to say very damning things about the intelligence setup in the country and especially in Mumbai...  Those days, the Special Branch had a special wing called 'the watchers branch.' The watchers used to mingle with local people, shop owners, roadside vendors and taxi drivers. They were the eyes and ears of the police. They briefed senior intelligence officers about what was happening in the city. That was a credible intelligence-gathering network.  But sadly, the watchers branch was disbanded. Now all the useless officers and constables are appointed in the Special Branch. Now the posting in the intelligence wing is regarded as punishment.  This is pretty much what I was trying to say in my  urlLink post , a few days back. Moreover, Balachandran also talks about why the brightest and the best in the police department no longer want to work in the intelligence department...  No police officer wants to work in the Special Branch now because there is no corruption there. You cannot make money out of the intelligence department. The temptations for working in an average police station are such that everybody wants to take up those posts, which would fetch them money.   I think we have systematically killed police intelligence in Mumbai and in other parts of the country. Unless we reorient and give emphasis to credible police intelligence system, similar bomb blasts would continue to hit Mumbai.   While it's true that policing a city like Mumbai is not an easy job and the gathering and analyzing intelligence in such a crowded and vast city is next to impossible, it still does not exonerate the politicians and police officials from the charge of breaking down one of the best internal intelligence setups in the world.

      A welcome fallout of the Cola controversy is that the  urlLink Govt. has issued draft norms, for beverages , in the form of a draft notification to amend the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, 1955.  Under the proposed amendments, the ministry of health and family welfare has suggested more stringent limits for the presence of pesticides, insecticides and heavy metals in all kinds of beverages.  While this tightening of limits is a welcome step, it still is hardly enough to check the presence of impurities in these beverages. One reason for that is the fact that it's just a set of rules that the Govt. is proposing to amend. These are merely suggestions for the industry to adhere to. They are not enforced in any way by the authorities. It is upto the beverage manufacturers to implement these rules of their own accord. The Govt. has merely raised the bar. It has not made it mandatory for the industry to clear the bar... leaving space for anybody to sneak beneath the bar.

      Was there really some specific intelligence information ( about possible terrorist strikes in Mumbai ) that the authorities in Mumbai received on the eve of the second 9-11 anniversary? or was Deputy Chief Minister Chhagan Bhujbal merely shooting off his mouth, as is his wont?!  We may never know for sure.  Earlier, Bhujbal had  urlLink gone public with claims  that he had received specific information that terrorists were about to strike key installations in Mumbai on 11 th  September. As a result, there was an unprecedented level of high-alert in the city. The "key installations" in question were put under round the clock vigil by the policemen and people were tense.  Immediately after Bhujbal gave these statements, everyone from senior police offcials to people in the home ministry  urlLink were up in arms and refuted  the presence of any such intelligence information. Bhujbal's deputy, Rajendra Darda, even went to the extent of publicly contradicting Bhujbal by saying, " There is no threat in the wake of 9/11. There is no information either. But our police are always vigilant. ". Even top police officials, past and present, criticized Bhujbal for shooting his mouth off in public.  9-11 passed without incident. There were no "incidents". Was it thanks to the police  bandobast  or was it due to the alert sounded by Bhujbal? Well, Bhujbal, not one to miss a trick, publicly declared that there were no untoward incidents because '  urlLink the terrorists changed their plan . '   By the way, one of the "key installations" in the list was supposed to be the famous  urlLink Siddhivinayak Temple  ( which is right next to my house btw ). Since early morning on 9-11, the police had cordoned off the access road to the temple and the traffic was diverted. No one was allowed to even park a vehicle on the cordoned-off stretch of road. Policemen were patrolling the area in numbers. They had set up sandbag-bunkers on all sides of the temple with arms and ammunition stacked for any eventuality. The whole area around my building resembled a war-zone. There was no way to approach the temple without going through at least one or two police-lines. It was an impressive show of might and resolve by the police.  The road is still cordoned off and the police presence is still very much evident around the temple. I dunno how long will the police disallow vehicles from plying along that important stretch of road.

      Whoa!!  urlLink Blogger bucks premium-services trend  by  eliminating its paid version !!  The creation of Blogger Pro, which cost subscribers a yearly fee of $35, came about as a result of financial necessity, Blogger co-founder Evan Williams wrote in an e-mail to subscribers. Now that Google owns the service, that need has passed.   "Pro subscribers helped keep us going as a struggling start-up, when servers and bandwidth were at an extreme premium," Williams wrote. "We wanted to keep basic Blogger free, but we needed to start charging in order to keep the lights onToday, as you may know, Blogger's situation is much different. For one thing, we're part of Google. Google has lots of computers and bandwidth. And Google believes blogs are important and good for the Web."   Google said it would give Blogger Pro subscribers either a $24 Blogger sweatshirt or a prorated cash refund.  Just to make sure, I checked on  urlLink Blogger  website too.

But I don't agree with this step taken by the FDA. I mean... it'll be a logistical nightmare to collect all the Dairy Milk chocolates from every nook and cranny of Mumbai, won't it?!  The FDA should've made a public announcement that went somewhat like... " People in Mumbai are hereby instructed to consume Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolates only with Pepsi or Coke. The pesticides in the colas will be put to good use by using them to kill off the worms found in the Dairy milk chocolates!! "

      Police have asked Shiv Sena  urlLink not to use loudspeakers at their annual Dussera rally. . Now, I fail to understand how the police expect a massive rally to be held without the use of loudspeakers. Every year, tens of thousands of people turn up at Shivaji Park for the annual Dussera rally by Shiv Sena. This rally is used by the Sena to talk about party policies and future plans. And this has been an annual feature for the past 38 years. I wonder how the police expect the speakers to address the huge crowd without loudspeakers.  As per the court order, the use of loudspeakers is prohibited within 100 metres of a place of worship. The venue of the rally - Shivaji Park in central Mumbai - falls within the 100 metre periphery of a Ganesh temple.  The temple that is being referred to here is the Udyan Ganesh temple which lies at the periphery of the ground. Knowing the temple and the ground, I'm certain that this police activism is purely poilitically motivated!!

So all that firepower... all that " shock and awe "... all that bluster... what was that for?

      Francois Gautier asks  urlLink Why do Indians put religion before nationality? . He does not restrict himself to this question only as he puts forth arguments that are valid and that beg to be answered by the pseudo-secularists. He fisks the press - both western as well as Indian, for being selectively secular.  I remember a few days after Graham Staines was killed, 14 Hindu labourers were murdered in Himachal Pradesh by Muslims separatists. The entire English speaking Indian press devoted page after page of outrage on the killing of Staines, but the murder of the Hindus in HP only warranted a few lines in most newspapers without condemnation. I can understand that Western correspondents based in India show such a slant  even if it does not speak much for their fairness  but Indian journalists, most of them Hindus at that!  What to do?! ... we're like this only!! Hindu killings are not news. Simply because they cannot be painted as communal, can they?!.  Recently, French President Jacques Chirac asked every Frenchman, specially the French Muslims, to be French first and Muslims second. In India, one often finds that people put their religion before their nationality, particularly the Muslims and to a lesser degree the Christians.  Ohh! ... just imagine Vajpayee making such an announcement!! He would be slaughtered... in the media... in the parliament... in the streets!! And every "secular" politician worth his salt would start rubbing his hands in glee and start dreaming of laughing his way to the [vote] bank!! And by the way, whatever may be his faults (and he has many of them!), Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray has been trying to say the same thing for years... Be an Indian first... and then a muslim... or a hindu... or a christian... whatever!

      Swapan Dasgupta, in his column in  urlLink Rediff  believes that  urlLink India and Pakistan belong to different civilisations .  We love to believe that the kindness shown to a Pakistani child with a heart ailment will melt even the most hardened souls across the border. We love to believe that the overpowering strength of the hospitality we experience during casual visits to Lahore means that politics is the only hurdle to rapprochement. And we love to believe, as Rajiv Gandhi once put it, that the Taj Mahal is as much theirs as Mohenjodaro is ours.  The time for such romantic piffle is over. Actually, there was never any basis for it.  Exactly!!  Likewise it is too naive to think that cricket or any other socio-cultural exchange will thaw the frozen attitudes on both sides. Pakistan's proclaimed strategic objective is to bleed India through a thousand cuts. With this larger strategic intent in mind, Pakistan may shift tactics and postures, but it will never walk the path of peace with India. Any Pakistani government who tries to take this path will be hounded at home and branded traitors. I wonder why successive governments in India have ignored this simple fact.  For too long India has allowed its responses to be guided by the sanctimoniousness of a professional peace lobby. It is time we ignored these appeasers of jihad. Let the prime minister's pronouncement that India cannot negotiate with terrorists be the final word on Pakistan.  Amen!

      We have yet another case of a company firing an employee for writing stuff related to the company on his/her blog. This time, the company is  urlLink Microsoft  and the blogger who has been fired, is  urlLink Michael Hanscom .  Last Thursday (October 23 rd ), Michael  urlLink posted an entry  on his blog mentioning how Microsoft was using  urlLink Apple Power Mac G5  computers in its Redmond campus. The post also contained a photo of a truck offloading the G5s. This seemingly innocuous post was either noticed or brought to the notice of some in Microsoft. And on Monday (October 27 th ), Michael's manager called him to inform him that he was " urlLink no longer welcome on the Microsoft campus ". In short, Michael was fired for allegedly violating security.  While blogging about the company you work for, is a dicey practice ( and I strongly advise people to refrain from doing it ), the way Microsoft has reacted in this incident can only be termed as knee-jerk and haphazard. By summarily firing Michael Hanscom, it has, no doubt, courted a PR disaster. What might've stayed fairly unknown, is now spreading across the Net at the speed of blogs.   What I fail to understand is... the photo contained in the  urlLink post  was completely innocent in itself. Michael chose to qualify it as being a pic of inside the Redmond campus. It was his word against that of Microsoft, had Microsoft chosen to merely refute Michael's claim. But by choosing to fire Michael, Microsoft has implicitly admitted that the photo is indeed what Michael claims it to be and that G5s are indeed used within Microsoft. ( I have it from reliable sources that Microsoft uses LINUX quite heavily inspite of publicly deriding claims that Linux is a serious competitor to its Windows line of Operating Systems ).  Surely, Microsoft cannot be this naive!!

      New Scientist  urlLink reports  that a Colorado based start-up is going to launch what is possibly the world's smallest full-featured PC, the MCC (Modular Computing Core).  The device is a single portable unit into which all the essential computing components are crammed. At 76 by 127 by 19 millimetres (5 x 3 x 3/4 inches), the MCC is not much bigger than a deck of cards.  ...   nside the MCC is a 1GHz microprocessor, 256 MB of RAM and a 10 or 15 GB hard drive. It will also run a full version of Microsoft's XP operating system, instead of the stripped-down operating systems used by handheld computers.  And, what would you have to shell out to go in for such a hybrid device? Almost $4000!!!

       urlLink The flight to India   George Monbiot argues that the jobs that are fleeing from the developed nations to developing ones like India are nothing but the jobs that were snatched from these very developing countries by Britain and other imperialist regimes at the height of colonization in the 18th and the 19th centuries.  And even though, I detect a leftist tinge to the whole article, I do agree on most of the points raised by the author of the article.  There is a profound historical irony here. Indian workers can outcompete British workers today because Britain smashed their ability to compete in the past. Having destroyed India's own industries, the East India Company and the colonial authorities obliged its people to speak our language, adopt our working practices and surrender their labour to multinational corporations. Workers in call centres in Germany and Holland are less vulnerable than ours, as Germany and Holland were less successful colonists, with the result that fewer people in the poor world now speak their languages.  Quite true! The vast spread of the British empire all over the world for nearly two centuries ensured that English was the dominant language in the world. To add to this, the servility to which Indians were reduced under the British rule also ensured that any Indian wanting to rise above his peers and countrymen looked up to his white-skinned masters and learnt their language. The ability to speak English was considered to be a differentiating factor and almost a status symbol. This trend, albeit in a milder  avatar , continues to this day.

      Nasser Hussain seems to have passed on the mantle of " Captain Grumpy " to Stephen Fleming. Fleming, obviously irritated at his team's performance, took the easy way out by  urlLink slamming early morning starts  for the matches that New Zealand have been involved in.  "They've got it wrong, you can't start this early with wickets like this, there's no point. We've been on the wrong side of it twice and it makes the next game a lottery too," Fleming said.  "There's two competitions going on - one for us and Australia where it seams around and is tough to bat and India lay another one where it gets lower and slower then turns. I wonder who did that itinerary," Fleming said.  Well, well, well!! Look who's talking??!! A Kiwi!! But hasn't he forgotten the time when India toured New Zealand?? What kind of conditions did India encounter over there??! Damp and seaming wickets right throughout the series...  [understatement]  heavily loaded in the favour of the home team pacemen  [/understatement] . Agreed that those wickets were okay for Test Matches... but we got exactly the same wickets for the one-dayers. Indians struggled and made noises about the conditions. But these noises fell on deaf ears. What was Fleming doing at that time? Just because it suited the Kiwis, he did not utter a word. And of course... it was just before the World Cup and what better preparation than thrashing the Indians just before the cup.  Fleming says that the games turn into lotteries with these early starts. But hey... what is one-day cricket if not a lottery?!! You win some and you lose some!  And did the Kiwis not reduce the Aussies to 65 for 4 in 15 overs in the match at Pune?? And that too bowling second... supposedly after the "juice" had gone out of the wicket!!... coz by Fleming's own admission, the seaming conditions ease out after the first 25 overs of the match! So how did NZ lose the match from there on??... The answer is... through inept cricket!! They dropped too many catches and displayed poor fielding. Maybe Fleming should look inwards and examine these reasons for his team's loss... rather than slamming the conditions!  Fleming should thank his stars that Indians played good hosts by not giving spinning, "dust-bowl" kind of wickets for the test series that recently concluded! Indians were well within their rights to do so, especially after the kind of wickets they encountered in NZ earlier this year!  So Mr. Fleming, could you keep your trap shut and get on with the game??!

      It seems the man who's on every Maharashtra politician and policeman's lips these days has contracted  urlLink a life-threatening illness .  What I fail to understand is how the hell do all the high profile convicts and criminals suddenly have health problems when they're jailed. Some contract "life-threatening" illnesses or some just complain of uneasiness run off to hospitals instead of spending nights in the cells. Do they believe that the public is so naive that their pathetic attempts at avoiding jail are not known to people??!  Looking at it from a different angle... I wonder what the police do inside the cells that hale and hearty convicts suddenly fall so sick. With so many "low-profile" deaths ( those of petty criminals... without any pull and power ) occurring in custody, one does not have to really wonder!! And in high-profile cases, a "life-threatening" illness will always precede death. Remember the sudden death of biscuit-king Rajan Pillai while in police custody some 8 years ago??

      An excellent example of mutual butt-scratching ( i'll scratch yours, so you better scratch mine ) is the case of RS Sharma, the beleagured ex-police commissioner who's now spending his last few days in service as chief vigilance officer of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( sic ).  After it was clear that Sharma had to go, Maharashtra Chief Minister Sushilkumar Shinde could have taken strong punitive action against him. But instead, he chose to take the  urlLink innocuous approach of sending Sharma on a leave . And then Shinde proudly proclaimed in front of the media that  urlLink he had taken "action"  on the SIT report by asking Sharma to go on leave.  Since this was a much lesser punishment for Sharma than what was actually warranted, Sharma chose to keep his mouth shut since he had but a few days to go before retirement.  But the cries for Sharma's head were growing by the day. And they could no longer be ignored by Shinde. So, in the end, the state government led by Shinde had to initiate a  urlLink departmental inquiry against Sharma .  As soon as the decision to initiate a departmental inquiry was made by Shinde, RS Sharma claimed that some ministers' (Maharashtra State Government) names had figured in investigations revealing links with the prime accused. It should be noted that Sharma could have divulged this information when he was quizzed by the SIT on November 8. But he did not do so!  And as soon as Sharma made this allegation, Sushilkumar Shinde had to whip out a  urlLink mandatory denial  today.  As soon as A stops scratching B's butt, B will stop scratching A's butt... and both A and B will suffer from itchy butts.

      The Abu Hafz al-Masri Brigade, the offshoot of Al Qaeda, which claimed responsibility for the dastardly bombings in Istanbul, Turkey, have referred to Kashmir  urlLink in their statement  that appeared on an Islamist website, Al Mujahidoun.  The text of that statement enumerates four demands that the terrorists have made from the US and its allies. Numbered three on that list of demands is the following...   3 - To purify all Islamic land from the filth of the Jews and Americans, including Jerusalem and Kashmir.   Hamid Mir, the Pakistani journalist who has interviewed Bin Laden, once said in an  urlLink interview with Rediff  that " Even Osama bin Laden told me in an interview that he is careful about India. He is not ready to comment a word on India. He is not ready to speak on the jihad in Kashmir. He says that if he speaks it will affect the Muslims of India. He says India is not his enemy, his fight is against America. "  Obviously, now that position no longer holds as far as Al Qaeda is concerned. Kashmir is undoubtedly creeping up the scale of importance within the Al Qaeda. And that does not really come as a surprise. After the purging of Al Qaeda operatives from Afghanistan in the wake of the 9/11 bombings, these fighters arrived in large numbers into Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) where they felt safe with tacit support of Pakistani intelligence agencies. So it was obvious that the Al Qaeda fighters would be drawn into the "holy" fight against the "oppressive Indian occupation" of Kashmir, in exchange for their safe sanctuary in PoK.  But in mentioning Kashmir, I think Al Qaeda has weakened Pakistan's position on Kashmir further in the eyes of the international community.  On the other hand, India had better pull up its socks and be prepared as fast as possible, or else it'll have to bear the impact of "Operation Islamic Iron Hammer".

      Pakistan president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf is upto his usual antics once again. After a brief hiatus in which the limelight was hogged by his puppet PM Jamali, Musharraf is back on the centrestage,  urlLink shooting off his mouth  in a BBC radio broadcast titled  Aapki Baat BBC Ke Saath .  He says that he's ready to pull back troops from PoK (Pakistan occupied Kashmir) if India pulls back its troops from Jammu and Kashmir.  "India has seven lakh soldiers in Kashmir, whereas Pakistan has only fifty thousand. If Indian government is ready to remove their forces, we will remove ours tomorrow."  Quite up-to-date on numbers, aren't we, Mushy?! But you fail to understand that the  urlLink Simla Agreement  of 1972, that you so willingly ignore and flout states categorically that  In order to initiate the process of the establishment of durable peace, both the governments agree that:   (i) Indian and Pakistani forces shall be withdrawn to their side of the international border.  ...  As far as India is concerned, the Simla Agreement will always be the basis of relations between India and Pakistan ( unless of course a path-breaking agreement is formulated and agreed upon by both the parties in question ). So it is pointless to ask India to withdraw troops from Jammu and Kashmir, because they are on our side of the internationational border. The Pakistani troops in PoK, however, are behind the LoC but are still on our side of the international border and therefore in violation of the agreement. So there is no way that India should agree to this proposal.  Musharraf then said that he would consider nominating Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for Pakistan's highest civilian honour, the  Nishaan-e-Pakistan  ( which had been once earlier conferred on the former Indian PM Morarji Desai ). This, on its own, is a commendable gesture. But Musharraf queered his own pitch by saying...  "If there is an achievement, which is significant from Pakistan's point of view, we would like to honour  anyone ,"   [emphasis mine]  Certainly, Vajpayee does not need a carrot like the Nishaan-e-Pakistan to intensify his efforts for the resolution of issues between India and Pakistan. His work in this area over the last 5 years has been largely one-sided and has resulted in him being made to look foolish after the Lahore and Agra summits. That merits an award. Linking an award is like dangling a carrot before Vajpayee. And Vajpayee would be the last person to desire such a carrot.  When asked if he would like to meet Vajpayee during the SAARC summit, Musharraf answered,  "Yes, if he wants to meet me, I will meet him."  "I am saying he should not get an impression, that since I have been saying this time and again, I am desperate to meet him. Let me tell you, I am living here and sitting comfortably there is no problem. I would meet him only if he wants."  Which basically begs the question, why should Vajpayee meet Musharraf at all?!! If Zafrullah Khan Jamali is the Pakistani Prime Minister and the head of the government, he is the one who should be meeting Vajpayee in Islamabad. Not Musharraf!! Or else, Mushy should drop all pretense about having a civilian government since the whole world knows that Jamali is a puppet who heads a civilian government cobbled together for him by the intelligence services!! His words on the matter leave nothing much for imagination...  Asked whether the Pakistani National Assembly or President was the final authority on Kashmir, Musharraf said "Whatever be the decision on Kashmir, it would be of the Assembly, but the President can contribute."  The word "contribute" being used here very very euphemistically!! ;-)  Then the Musharraf show takes on a comical turn as he spouts such inane and confused gems as...  "Remember it is the beginning of an end." ...  "I am confident that if we have the sincerity, then we can move forward leaving all this behind." ...  Beginning of the end?? What is he talking about? And does he want to imply that the peace process has been stalled because he's been insincere up until now??!  And then, Musharraf responds to Afghan President Hamid Karzai's charge that Taliban Chief Mullah Mohammad Omar was seen in Pakistan. He describes the charges as "extremely annoying" and says...  "No country can claim to have done more against terrorism than Pakistan. We have nabbed and killed 600 terrorists.  "No one should talk in this way, let us all worry about our own countries," Musharraf said.  * At this point Sameer had to be carried away after he fell off the chair, laughing hard!! *

      Today is 1 st  December, World  AIDS  Day. No other disease in the history of mankind has represented a bigger medical and social challenge than AIDS. And compounding the problem are the frightfully low levels of awareness amongst the masses, especially among the various high-risk groups. If you add govenrmental apathy to that, you can imagine why it is being predicted that by 2005 India will have more AIDS cases than those in the entire continent of Africa. Frightening!!  Looking at figures, according to  urlLink NACO  by the end of October this year, there have been  urlLink 56151 reported cases of AIDS  in India. Exactly one year back, NACO reported 41606 cases. So over the last year, there has been a 35% increase in the number of AIDS cases in India. And these are just the reported cases. Like an iceberg, a huge number of cases still lie hidden under the surface.   The Indian government has been sluggish with its response to tackle the AIDS crisis. However, on the eve of the World AIDS Day, health minister Sushma Swaraj  urlLink announced  that it will supply free drugs to those affected by AIDS. In addition to this, she also indicated that a new law is likely, that would make discrimination against HIV positive people and the refusal by hospitals to treat them an offence.  Btw, if you have a website or a blog, you might want to participate in the  urlLink Link and Think project.

      The premiere of the most awaited movie of the year,  urlLink The Return of The King , takes place in Wellington, New Zealand today. The premiere would be preceeded by a parade by the cast and crew of the epic trilogy directed by the diminutive Peter Jackson.  Fans crowded the venue of the parade, twenty four hours before it was due to even start. They were  urlLink rewarded for their patience  when at midnight, stars from the film went around, chatting with them and signing autographs.  New Zealand Herald has a  urlLink running commentary of the parade , updated every few minutes with tidbits about the stars and their soundbites.  Webcams placed strategically along the route of the parade are  urlLink webcasting the event  live.  The LoTR fever is at its height!! And I can't wait for the film to be released for the public.

      Good news for coffee lovers!! People who drink coffee (caffeinated) regularly, have significantly lower risk of contracting diabetes, even if they are overweight. This is  urlLink according to a study  carried out by the researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.  The study of 125,000 people suggests that caffeinated coffee -- not caffeine-free -- may affect the body's metabolism in positive ways, the researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health said.   Men who drank more than six cups of full-caffeine coffee a day cut their risk of diabetes by more than half over 12 to 18 years, the study found. Women who drank that much coffee reduced their risk by 30 percent.   Writing in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the researchers said it was not clear what caffeinated coffee does to reduce the risk of type-II or adult-onset diabetes.  Ahaa! thats all the more reason for me to go up to the caf on the first floor and order my usual Cafe Mocha!! ;-)

      Hello and Good morning / Good afternoon / Good evening to all!!  This is Supersam, live, from Stockley Park, London. Its my first post since I landed here in the UK on the 3 rd  of January, 2004. I hope this post finds you in great health and good humour!! :-)  Stockley Park is where my office is located. However, I'm put up at a nice little comfortable house in a quiet, idyllic town called Hayes which isn't too far from the office.  I'll post a lot more about my trip and my first wekend in UK, but right now, I'm soaking in the brilliant sunshine that has just decided to poke out of the dull and dreary cloud-cover that perennially seems to cover this place. The morning that started off as cold, gray and rainy... has now blossomed into a pleasantly cool morning with  clear, azure sky to go alongwith it. So while others have decided to down the drapes to block out the sun, I let them remain open to let the sunlight warm my face as I type out this post with a smile on my lips.  More later! Have a glorious day ahead, folks!! :-)

      With all kinds of colourful Homeland Security alerts in place, US claims to be well in control of the security situation. The nationwide Orange alert that existed over the Christmas holiday period was  urlLink lowered by one level to Yellow  just recently. But the airports and airlines continued to be at the Orange alert status indicating an elevated security risk.  Then came the extraordinary cancellations of international flights to the US, which included the  urlLink cancellation of two British Airways flights . US officials spoke at length about how the flights were cancelled only after specific intelligence information.  All this leads one to believe that the extraordinary security measures by the US security agencies have proved to be quite effective in avoiding repeats of Sept 11 style incidents.  But then how can the American officials explain the  urlLink discovery of live ammunitions  in the coat pocket of a 45-year old Sudanese man who came to Heathrow (en route to Dubai) from Washington DC's Dulles airport?! If the terror alert is still Orange at airports in the US, how did these bullets in the coat pocket go undetected through the 'intensive checks' that would've been performed at the Dulles airport?! And it seems all the more ridiculous when one considers the fact that the bullets were found during 'routine' checks at Heathrow.  Makes one wonder if all the security system in place in the US is all smoke and mirrors!!

      The Golden Arches turned out to be the gateways to hell for Morgan Spurlock who decided to document  urlLink the effects of spending a month eating only at McDonald's .  In addition to adding 25 pounds to his 6 foot 2, 185 pounds frame, he suffered lots of other undesirable and harmful effects...   Within a few days of beginning his drive-through diet, Spurlock, 33, was vomiting out the window of his car, and doctors who examined him were shocked at how rapidly Spurlock's entire body deteriorated.   "It was really crazy - my body basically fell apart over the course of 30 days," Spurlock told The Post.   His liver became toxic, his cholesterol shot up from a low 165 to 230, his libido flagged and he suffered headaches and depression.   Spurlock has documented his month-long experience in a tongue-in-cheek documentary called, "Super Size Me", which he's taken to the Sundance Film Festival.  While one may argue that no one in their right mind would live only off McDonald's stuff, this experiment by Spurlock does indeed make a strong point against the junk food which is the source of the obesity epidemic that plagues America today.

      Pakistan, according to USA's latest position on it, is clean and is  urlLink not involved in nuclear proliferation .  This is just days after Dr. AQ Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb admitted to selling nuclear secrets to countries like Iran, Libya and North Korea. With at least four other scientists involved with him in this sharing of nuclear technology to known rogue nations, it is difficult to believe that they all acted on their own without some sort of collusion with the government or its agencies. Its difficult to believe this because...   No questions were asked about Khan's lifestyle, his frequent trips abroad -- always first class -- and his lengthy periods of residence under an assumed name at some of the world's most expensive hotels.  Successive heads of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence ignored allegations of financial impropriety until 1990, when Lieutenant General Shamshur Rahman Kallu prepared a report for the attention of the then prime minister Benazir Bhutto.  The report gathered dust until fresh investigations were ordered on the instructions of ISI chief Lieutenant General Mahmoud Ahmad, who handed his findings over to Musharraf in 2001.    [taken from a  urlLink Rediff report ]   Moreover, with General Aslam Beg  urlLink alleging  that Pervez Musharraf has been actively involved in nuclear proliferation and with Benazir Bhutto and Shehbaz Sharif (Nawaz Sharif's brother) planning to send a joint application to the International Court of Justice to try Musharraf for spreading nuclear weapons, it's too damned difficult to digest this latest US posture!  Ohh... but I'm sure that it has got absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the US is planning  urlLink an anti-Osama offensive inside Pakistan  which would entail getting in the good books of Pakistan ( which would, otherwise, never allow an US action on Pakistani soil )

      Past words can come back to haunt you. Sometimes they get you into serious trouble while at other times, they make you seem like a fool!! ( even after granting some leeway for hindsight! )  In 1979, Shyam Bhatia and Colin Smith authored an article on the nuclear espionage perpetrated by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan ( father of Pakistan's nukes )    in Holland, a charge that has since been established as being true.  Incensed at this article, AQ Khan shot off a handwritten letter condemning it. While a letter of condemnation is not out of place, the coarse language used in it certainly stood out like a sore thumb. Shyam Bhatia has published the contents of that letter in  urlLink an article  on  urlLink Rediff.com  today.  Have a look at the abusive language of Dr. AQ Khan who was furious at the charge of being labelled as a nuclear thief...  'The article on Pakistan in the issue of 9.12.1979 by Colin Smith and Shyam Bhatia was so vulgar and low that I considered it an insult to reflect on it.  It was in short words a bull-shit, full of lies, insinuations and cheap journalism for money and cheap publicity.  Shyam Bhatia, a Hindu bastard, could not write anything objective about Pakistan. Both insinuated as if Holland is an atomic bomb manufacturing factory where, instead of cheese balls, you could pick up "triggering mechanisms." Have you for a moment thought of the meaning of this word?  Of course not because you could not differentiate between the mouth and the back hole of a donkey. I do not owe an explanation to anybody, but I did owe an explanation to the Dutch government, which I did with all the documents.  Not the language that would befit a national hero, is it?! But the language is not really the point here. The point is... now that the man in question, himself, has admitted to being a global nuclear black-marketeer, this letter makes him look like a bloody fool, doesn't it?! ;-)  By the way, the New York Times has an  urlLink in-depth story   (NYTimes registration required)  on how Dr. AQ Khan built up his global network of illicit nuclear trade ...  The scope and audacity of the illicit network are still not fully known. Nor is it known whether the Pakistani military or government, which had supported Dr. Khan's research, were complicit in his activities.   But what has become clear in recent days is that Dr. Khan, a Pakistani national hero who began his rise 30 years ago by importing nuclear equipment to secretly build his country's atom bomb, gradually transformed himself into the largest and most sophisticated exporter in the nuclear black market.   "It was an astounding transformation when you think about it, something we've never seen before," said a senior American official who has reviewed the intelligence. "First, he exploits a fragmented market and develops a quite advanced nuclear arsenal. Then he throws the switch, reverses the flow and figures out how to sell the whole kit, right down to the bomb designs, to some of the world's worst governments."

      One particular paragraph from Chapter 12 of the  urlLink Economic Report of the President , for the year 2004, reads,  One facet of increased services trade is the increased use of offshore outsourcing in which a company relocates labor-intensive service industry functions to another country. For example, a U.S. firm might use a call-center in India to handle customer service-related questions. The principal novelty of outsourcing services is the means by which foreign purchases are delivered. Whereas imported goods might arrive by ship, outsourced services are often delivered using telephone lines or the Internet. The basic economic forces behind the transactions are the same, however.  When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than to make or provide it domestically.    [emphasis mine]   This report was presented by President Bush to the Congress on Monday 9 th  February.  This is good news for India because it means that the US administration has thrown its weight behind the concept of offshore outsourcing, something that has been vilified in recent times by most of the sections of the media and the Democrats looking for popular support.  But it remains to be seen how this would affect Bush's ratings with the election approaching because this is clearly a decision that would not go down well with the multitudes of people in the US who have lost their jobs due to outsourcing!

      NYTimes columnist, Thomas L. Friedman, currently in India joins the outsourcing debate with a sensible argument backed with facts.  " urlLink What goes around... "  [NYTimes registration required]  argues why it is good for the Westerns countries to outsource jobs to India...   "How can it be good for America to have all these Indians doing our white-collar jobs?" I asked 24/7's founder, S. Nagarajan.  Well, he answered patiently, "look around this office." All the computers are from Compaq. The basic software is from Microsoft. The phones are from Lucent. The air-conditioning is by Carrier, and even the bottled water is by Coke, because when it comes to drinking water in India, people want a trusted brand. On top of all this, says Mr. Nagarajan, 90 percent of the shares in 24/7 are owned by U.S. investors. This explains why, although the U.S. has lost some service jobs to India, total exports from U.S. companies to India have grown from $2.5 billion in 1990 to $4.1 billion in 2002. What goes around comes around, and also benefits Americans.    ...   "It's unfair that you want all your products marketed globally," argues Mr. Kulkarni, "but you don't want any jobs to go."  He's right. Which is why we must design the right public policies to keep America competitive in an increasingly networked world, where every company  Indian or American  will seek to assemble the best skills from around the globe. And we must cushion those Americans hurt by the outsourcing of their jobs. But let's not be stupid and just start throwing up protectionist walls, in reaction to what seems to be happening on the surface. Because beneath the surface, what's going around is also coming around. Even an Indian cartoon company isn't just taking American jobs, it's also making them.   Now if only the demagogues who see things in black and white would stop to consider that outsourcing has many shades to it!!

With over 75,000 members, it is a major force in advancing the skills of information technology professionals and students wordwide.  ACM's most prestigious technical award is the Turing award. It carries a prize of $100,000 and is considered to be an honour among the computing community. The list of the earlier recepients of this award reads like a virtual who's who of computing, viz.

For those who do not know Alan Kay, he is the person who created Smalltalk, a language that is considered to be 'purely' object oriented and that is used as a standard for comparison with other languages that claim to be object-oriented. Alan Kay was also responsible for pioneering many of the ideas at the root of contemporary object-oriented programming languages and as such is one of the founding fathers of the concept of OOP. In addition to this, he is also the conceiver of the laptop computer and considered by many as the architect of the modern windowing GUI. As if that wasn't enough already, he also participated in the early design of ARPANet which, as we all know, became the Internet. Among his other achievements have been the involvement in the teams that developed Ethernet, laser printing and network "client-servers".  Alan Kay is also famous for his celebrated quote, " The best way to predict the future is to invent it ."   And he has been true to his words if you consider his life's works.

      The champion of the poor and minorities, the fearless crusader against neo-liberalism and neo-fascism, the Goddess of idiotic things  urlLink speaks yet again .  Just reading all that bombastic crap about people voting out communalism and neo-liberalism is enough to put me in the mood for a thorough fisking of her article.  But work and procrastination are a powerful combination. And I let the opportunity pass! ;-)  Even so, I just have to mention a few points...    The rightwing BJP-led coalition has not just been voted out of power, it has been humiliated. It cannot but be seen as a decisive vote against communalism, and neo-liberalism's economic "reforms". The Congress has become the largest party. The left parties, the only parties to be overtly (but ineffectively) critical of the reforms, have been given an unprecedented mandate.   Just a cursory glance at the statewise results of Elections 2004 and their comparison with results of the 1999 elections would tell you how big a role 'anti-incumbency' played (as usual) in these elections. So Roy's overtly (but ineffective) leftist arguments don't really hold!    In Gujarat and Mumbai, it (POTA) is used almost exclusively against Muslims. In Gujarat, after the 2002 pogrom in which an estimated 2,000 Muslims were killed, 287 people were accused under Pota: 286 were Muslim and one a Sikh.   While this figure of 2000 Muslims is being bandied around, the actual figure was said to be anything between 800 to 2000. Quite a wide margin, isn't it?! And yet, the Internet is littered with a zillion websites denigrating India for letting 'over 2000' muslims be killed by frenzied Hindu fanatics in the Gujarat riots! But, only a thorough search on the Net would yield figures of the Hindus killed (around 300) there. But hey... that was just self-defense, wasn't it?!  In any case, the point I am trying to make is simple. The Gujarat riots took place mainly in three cities, Ahmedabad, Baroda and Godhra. And if the people have voted decisively this time around to root out communalism, then who, do you think, would have won the LS seats from these cities?! ... Surely not the evil monster, BJP!! ... :-o  Anyways... these are more words than I can spare to spend over a pointless piece of writing! So I shall end this post here!

      After the storm that erupted ensuing the Congress 'victory' in the elections and the theatrics that followed when it was announced that Sonia Gandhi would be the PM, there has been a slew of writings in support of and protest against Sonia Gandhi as the Indian Prime Minister.  We had politicians, opinion-makers, journalists, bloggers and in fact the whole world and its uncle on either side of the fence trying to bark ferociously at each other. It sure made for some interesting hearing and reading!  Countless arguments have since been raised and countered by either side. Some of these arguments have had logic behind them while others have been emotional rants full of extreme jingoism and/or a misplaced sense of pluralism/liberalism.  I can understand and empathize with most of these arguments even if they might be diametrically opposite to the views I hold. After all, that is what democracy is all about! ... Differences of opinion and arguments to settle those differences!  But what I cannot take and what makes my blood boil is when someone writes something with malevolent and ill-informed judgement and that is written with calumnious intentions.   urlLink Sonia Gandhi: The Once and Future Prime Minister of India  is such a vile piece of bull crap!  The author of the article, Egbert Bhatty ( I'll call him 'Butt'y ), repeatedly refers to one editorial from  urlLink The Dishrag of India  to 'reinforce' his arguments. That, in itself, is farcical to begin with!  'Butt'y also uses excerpt from an uncredited 'web entry' to score his first point...   A Web entry expressed it best:  BJP supporters [sic] ass is on fire whenever exit poll results are out..   To put it in American terms  Sonia Gandhi kicked BJP ass.  Juvenile, to say the least!  Next comes his claim that BJP  repeatedly  referred to Sonia as an Italian bitch...  During the three-week election they had repeatedly referred to Sonia Gandhi as the Italian bitch [ Italian female dog , were the exact words used] and repeatedly referred to her son Rahul as a mongrel [ hybrid , was the exact word used].  Now... not being in India during the run-up to the elections, I cannot say anything for certain about this claim, but I do know for sure that about an year or so ago, Praveen Togadia had allegedly obliquely referred to Sonia Gandhi as an italian dog. His exact words (in the context of the uproar in the country after the Gujarat riots broke out) were... " First, the local pups started barking (against Hindus). They were then joined by dogs from other parts of the country. And last, came Italy ni kutri (a bitch from Italy) ". It was a despicable thing to say (something that was printed and reprinted  ad nauseum  by the media) and even the VHP distanced itself from Togadia's remarks. But I clearly do not recall having heard this 'bitchy' epithet during these elections! Please correct me if I am wrong, but I think these kinds of mis-informed 'facts' deserve utter contempt... something that they hardly get from us Indians!   Now, whipped by a slip of a girl, the worst kind of humiliation that can be suffered by an Indian male, the BJP turned its full fury against Sonia Gandhi.  Her accession to the position of Prime Minister would  undo the very identity of Bharat [India] as a nation and of the Bharatiyas [Indians] as a people , thundered a Hindus extremist ideologue.  Hold it right there Mr. 'Butt'y... where does this gender issue enter this whole debate about Sonia Gandhi?! India has had women politicians for ages now! And they've been defeating their male counterparts in elections forever now! Why would such an argument even be raised?! And how connected is it to the remarks made by that 'Hindus [sic] extremist idealogue'?? I fail to see any logic here!  Moreover, it is not just the Hindu extremists who've been talking about the undoing of the identity of India if Sonia became the Prime Minister! Similar sentiments have been echoed by Francois Gautier in his column titled ' urlLink The white woman and india ' as also Rajeev Srinivasan in his column, ' urlLink Summer of Our discontent '. None of them are Hindu extremists, I am sure!   Although the BJP Administration created the conditions for the current high 8% growth of the Indian economy, there was no trickle down to the poor.  Half the Indian population of one billion still lives on less than $2 per day.  Which is way better than the Congress managed in the 50 years it ruled India!   Soon, her election district began referring to her as hamari bahu  --  our daughter-in-law.  Then, as she crisscrossed the length and breadth of India, covering some 40,000 miles in long days in searing heat of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the disadvantaged of India, in both the rural and the urban areas, realized that this was not your usual politician  interested only in their vote.  Sonia Gandhi, they realized, genuinely felt empathy for their plight.  They began calling her desh ki bahu  daughter-in-law of the nation.  Much to the chagrin of the BJP.  'Butt'y sure has some sense of humour! That paragraph had me laughing my guts out!! Will someone tell the poor sod that the Congress recruited Sonia to save themselves from getting wiped off the Indian political scene...  i.e.  to get them some votes in the name of the Gandhi family!   What got the BJP dander up even further was Sonia Gandhis well-reasoned, well-crafted, well-calibrated attacks on the pro-business economic policies of the BJP which left the poor behind, and its social policy of Hindu supremacy which pitted Indian against Indian.  Instead, she appealed for unity, tolerance  love among all men.   Despite her heavily-accented Hindi, Sonia Gandhis message of love got through to her audience.  It was clear from the throngs that attended her election rallies that she had connected with them  and, they had connected with her.  Are we talking about Mother Teresa here?! ... or Sonia Gandhi?!!  After a few further paragraphs of rambling, 'Butt'y makes a revelation...  There has been some speculation that Priyanka and Rahul persuaded their mother, Sonia Gandhi, not to accept the position of Prime Minister for fear of being assassinated by a Hindu extremist.  [Her husband Rajiv was assassinated in 1991; her mother-in-law, her husband Rajivs mother, Indira Gandhi, was, also, assassinated in 1984.]  From the available facts it appears to be just that  speculation.  Will someone tell the ignorant author that Rajiv Gandhi and Indira Gandhi were  NOT  assasinated by Hindu extremists!! Is he on drugs or something?!  The list of mis-informed opinions and 'facts' just goes on and on and on!! It just makes me mad that people like Egbert Bhatty are spreading such lies!! I agree that BJP overdid things when it came to protesting Sonia Gandhi's candidature for the post of Prime Minister. It sure gave voice to people like this Bhatty to air their trashy and downright slanderous views!!

      The  urlLink chameleon  who changes his colours every time a new government comes into power in Delhi, has done it once again!  He has  urlLink laid the blame of his party's debacle in Andhra Pradesh, squarely on the shoulders of BJP , the party which helped him change the perception of Andhra Pradesh throughout the world.  While political commentators and poll analysts throughout the country have been unanimous in their criticism of Naidu for his over-ambitious emphasis on technology while being ignorant of the masses living in poverty in Andhra Pradesh, Naidu is unapologetic in his blame on the BJP...   In his address, on the concluding day of the two-day 'Mahanadu,' the party's annual convention, Naidu said the Muslim community was alienated from the TDP because of the Godhra incident, though he was the first Chief Minister to have demanded the ouster of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.   He also said that the TDP suffered the wrath of Christians due to anti-conversion bill and other measures proposed by the NDA government at the Centre to regulate the funds received by Christian organisations, though his party had nothing to do with there decisions.   So the great, progressive minded CEO of AP has sunk to the depths of vote-bank politics after all!!  Such a slimey pseud!!

      Arun Jaitley, suave and urbane to some, glib-tongued to others, has never been short of words.  In an  urlLink interview  to  urlLink Rediff.com , he speaks about BJP's loss and the probable reasons behind the defeat that took the party by surprise.  While I do not agree with some of the reasons he gives to explain the defeat, I do think some of the points he raises are valid. One such point is the one about ' campaign of negativism '.   In Indian elections, when you conduct a campaign, you invariably succeed on a campaign of negativism. The [A B] Vajpayee campaign in Delhi, the (Chandrababu) Naidu campaign in Andhra, and the [S M] Krishna campaign in Karnataka were identical. All three campaigns claimed that we have done a good job. All three campaigns said our leaders have a positive image and they presented a vision of India. All three campaigns were positive.  As against this, if you conduct a campaign with an element of negativism, as it happened in 1977 and 1984, it clicks. In 1977, post-Emergency, when Mrs (Indira) Gandhi's decline started, there was an element of negativism, people voted against the Emergency. In 1984, people voted against the killing of Mrs Gandhi.   If you consider it for a moment, this campaign of negativism is nothing but the concept of anti-incumbency! And as I've maintained all along, the biggest factor in Indian elections is the crucial factor of anti-incumbency!  KPS Gill makes a mention of this anti-incumbency in  urlLink one of his articles  before the election results were out...   All this does not augur well for Indian democracy, or for Indias future. The present elections will install a new coalition at the Centre, and new governments in some of the States, most of which, like the majority of recent regimes, will prove to be non-performers, and will fail to come to grips with the basic problems that confront the nation. The new incumbents  whatever their structure and constitution  will start with heady propaganda about the grand transformations they plan for the nation; but will fail to effectively implement most of what they promise. Nevertheless, they will project a false propaganda of fictional achievements, which they will eventually begin to believe themselves. Till the acid test of the next election brings transient disillusionment.   Coming back to Arun Jaitley, he explains why only Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, etc. witnessed this anti-incumbency effect but not Bihar or UP.   In India, when the BJP and the Congress party contest an election after remaining in power, they need a major political performance to get back into power. Not so for regional parties. So if Digvijay [Singh] or Krishna doesn't perform, they will be shown the door.  But Bihar, UP and West Bengal are exceptions. In UP and Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, and Bahujan Samaj Party have caste as a fallback even though they don't perform. Even when they don't do their jobs well, their caste remains consolidated. Caste-based voting is not performance-centric.  The Left Front has cadres, which has helped them to de-link the election and government performance in West Bengal. Also, the Congress party, BJP and Trinamool Congress divide votes and benefit the Leftists. These three parties can't unite against the Leftists. Kerala is a revolving door where two groups are keeping power alternatively.   He makes a very important point here which politicians often tend to explain with various labels such as charisma, magic, etc. I mean, the continued reign of Laloo in Bihar is put down to his rustic charm and the charisma he posesses!  A similar point is also made by KPS Gill in the article mentioned above.   On the other hand we have leaders like Laloo Prasad Yadav, whose party does not even pretend to make an offer of governance or development to the people of Bihar, but whose manipulation of the lowest common denominators of social mobilization  caste and communal polarities  have guaranteed his repeated success. Worse still, parties with great pretensions to nationalism and noble political lineage have not only failed altogether to create a credible alternative to Bihars current anarchy, but have in fact been eager to forge the most unprincipled alliances with the party that has brought the State to its present condition as the epitome of the most abject misery and lawlessness.    One of Gill's points is something that I have always belived...   The general population of flatterers and self-servers among the political classes has grown so greatly, moreover, that politicians have lost all grips over grassroots reality. No single leader relies on party cadres, even in the rare cases where these still exist. It is petty coteries that invent false realities that are the source of all political intelligence  till the harsh realities of an election bring fruitless disillusionment. Unreliable though the recent exit polls may be, they have shocked the ruling coalition into the realization that India is somewhat larger than the little pools of light where it appears to be shining.   Parties, today, do not take up people's issues and use them as an ideological base. What they do is in fact the opposite of this. They create issues and ideologies that have little or no support among the populace. Then they go around the country trying to build up public opinion in support of these ideologies. This 'top-down' approach is fatal when it comes to elections. Usually this happens to the parties in power since it is during the time a party is power that it loses contact with the grassroots. The self-serving sycophants run off to the power centres leaving their constituencies high and dry. Without any real contact with the ground realities, these parties have to invent issues!  Ok... once again back to Jaitley...  He says about the India Shining campaign,   "Even now I think that campaign gave a sense of confidence in the [growing] economy. It helped build an image outside India about India."   I wonder what good is a good image outside the country if you are fighting elections within it! Perhaps in their eagerness to make an impact on the world stage, the BJP spin doctors forgot that the elections are fought in the villages and towns of India!  Then Jaitley raises perhaps one of the most important points in his interview. Something that the Congress will have to grapple with in the days and months to come.   The turning point has already arrived. Now, what I'll hate to see is a debate -- are reforms politically costly? Is there a cost to reform because it will have political fallout? Shall we make the whole of India a Bihar? Shall we create caste issues or any such fallback systems to win elections, but not performance? I think it's not desirable for India if this debate will decide that since reforms are costly you abandon them. We will go the Bihar way.   Already the Left parties, with a meagre 61 seats in the new Lok Sabha, have been trying to impose their will on the economic policies of the Government. The issue before the PM and the FM would be to decide if they want to make the reform process run its own course or let it be strangled by the populist rants of the Left!  While the whole country is speaking about the renewed strength of the Congress, Jaitley says this of the Congress...   I have not the least hesitation in saying that the Congress party from an ideological movement has reduced itself to a crowd around the Gandhi family. This happened 30 years ago. To a proud Indian it's not a matter of glory; it is a matter for soul-searching.   The BJP will overcome its problems. We will stay on. But the fact is that when the Gandhi family delivers, the Congress is on top, and when the family doesn't deliver, as has happened several times in the past, the Congress party refuses to come to terms with itself.   And I tend to agree with his views on this!  And if you feel confused by the point of this post, let me assure you that I'm the one who's more confused! ;-)

      With power firmly in their grasp, the 'secular' forces in the country have initiated the process of 'de-saffronisation' of education. The first salvo has been fired in Delhi where the NCERT curriculum will be replaced by SCERT.   Delhi Government today announced to replace the curriculum of NCERT with that of State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) in the government-run schools of the Capital.   Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit met HRD Minister Arjun Singh today to apprise him of the changed curriculum. The move appears to be a lead in 'de-saffronisation' of education.   I do not want to discuss the issues behind the saffronisation and the subsequent de-saffronisation of education in the country, but this move by the Delhi and Central Government only goes to prove the age-old adage that history is written by the victors!  So claims like the one below mean nothing to me...   "Over the years, distortion of facts had occurred in text books and education was being tilted towards a particular ideology affecting the secular ethos of the country," Dikshit told reporters citing the cause behind the move to shift.   On the books being introduced, the Chief Minister said these were "strong on facts of history, reinforcing secular ethos of the country" and "nothing had been done to distort history."   After all... all they are doing is to tailor the history books in accordance to their ideology, which, with due respect to Gandhi and Nehru, is nothing but Gandhisation of history, whether you like it or not!

       urlLink www.hinduunity.org , a website that proclaims that it promotes and supports the " ideals of Bajrang Dal, VHP and Youth Wing Bharat ", has been blocked by the biggest ISP in India,  urlLink Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited . It has also been blocked by smaller ISPs like  urlLink Hathway  and  urlLink HCL Infinet . This gagging has taken place on the basis of a request from the office of Mumbai Police Commissioner.   The site has been blocked on the basis of a request from the Mumbai police commissioner's office in a letter sent out to ISPs on April 28.  Sources at the Mumbai police commissioner's office said the directive was issued because the web site published inflammatory material against Islam. Joint Commissioner of Police (crime) Dr Satyapal Singh, a decorated officer of the Indian Police Service, authorised the note.   While the big daddy VSNL ( with around 800,000 subscribers ) has acted promptly in response to the request, SIFY ( reportedly with 700,000 subscribers ) has refused to heed the request which, it says, has not come through the right channels.   "Only CERT has the right to issue such an order," said Sify spokesman David Appasamy. "In case they do, we have no option but to comply. When we got the request from the police commissioner's office, we spoke to them and explained that we could block the site only if the order came from CERT."   These things apart, this gagging order raises serious issues of restriction of freedom of expression on the Net. And coming, as it does immediately after a ' secular ' government has taken oath, it raises fears of a re-emergence of an era of vote-bank politics and minority-appeasement!!  I know that I am just conjecturing at this moment, but if such a thing happens, the ball that was in the Congress court after the public display of ' inner voices ', will fall right back into the BJP's court!

      Having suffered embarrassment and condemnation from all quarters, George W. Bush decided to close the huge Abu Ghraib prison, terming it as a symbol of the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime.  The logic of both, the timing as well as the reasoning behind the demolition, escape me!  First of all, it was the American soldiers who did all the torturing which has led to the situation that Bush finds himself into. So, its strange that he chooses to demolish the structure instead of dealing with the people involved.  Also, it is not as if there's a huge groundswell in Iraq in favour of demolishing the prison. Such a public opinion, if it exists, is in the US rather than in Iraq! So, what Bush essentially is trying to do is to play to the galleries at home, rather than do something towards the aspirations of the Iraqis. Most Iraqis  urlLink seem to be wondering  why the prison has to go instead of the people staffing it!  Bush also mentioned that United States would fund the bulding of a new prison after the June 30 deadline for handing over limited governing authority to the Iraqis. Now, one wonders if this isn't just an exercise for the benefit of US contractors!!  And finally, if the  urlLink abuse and ill-treatment  of  urlLink prisoners in American prisons  is publicized, would George W. Bush go around the country knocking down these prisons and building new ones in their places!?!

      Security/Foreign affairs expert, Brahma Chellaney, blames the  urlLink Nehruvian legacy  in Indian foreign policy over the years for the repeated betrayals that India has had to suffer.   Zeal is to Indian diplomacy what strategy is to major powers. India has rushed to believe what it wanted to believe. Consequently, India is the only known country in modern history to have repeatedly cried betrayal, not by friends but by adversaries in whom it had reposed trust.   And its not just Nehru who blundered in his handling of foreign poliy. Atal Bihari Vajpayee too is guilty of living in a fools' paradise...   Vajpayee's fascination with telling the world about the 'greatness' of Indian culture was his rendering of Nehru's moralistic lectures to the mighty and powerful. Like Nehru, he was so enthralled by his own illusions and desire for international goodwill that he could not deal with ill will from India's implacable adversaries. Even in war, Vajpayee declined -- unlike Lal Bahadur Shastri -- to take the fighting to the aggressor's territory, battling the enemy on the enemy's terms and relying on the United States to midwife a 'victory' in Kargil.

      India's external affairs minister, Natwar Singh ( nicknamed ' urlLink Nutwar ' by The Acorn ) is fast gaining notoriety for his penchant for putting his feet in his mouth. His statements on India's position vis-a-vis sending troops to Iraq have left much to be desired about his abilities to handle a sensitive ministry like external affairs.  Here is what he  urlLink said  on Friday in Washington after a 60-minute meeting with the US Secretary of State Colin Powell,   "There is a resolution of the last Parliament on this issue in which we had given  our opinion that we were against sending troops to Iraq .  Now the situation has changed.  There is a resolution unanimously passed in the United Nations and there are Arab members in it.  We will look at it very carefully "    [emphasis mine]   And now, here is what he  urlLink said  today in a prepared statement at the Indian embassy in Washington,   "The question of sending Indian troops to Iraq does not arise. Government's position on this issue is based on national consensus, reflected in our parliamentary resolution. No request has been made for sending Indian troops."   As far as I'm concerned, this is 'Nutwar' Singh speaking with his foot in his mouth!!

       urlLink Ravikiran  and  urlLink Jivha  have an interesting topic up for discussion on their sites.  Ad Hominem  fallacies.  For those who are unaware of the existence of such a fallacy, let me explain in a nutshell.  Ad Hominem  is Latin for "against the man" or "to the man". So an  ad hominem  argument (or fallacy) is an argument against your opponent rather than against the arguments he/she has put forth. As a result, the argument often tends to be irrelevant to the logic and/or facts of the opponent's arguments and hence is classified under "Fallacies of Relevance". Further reading material on the subject is available at places such as  urlLink this  or  urlLink this  or  urlLink this  ... and so on!  Ravikiran takes the example of a rape victim who's probably trying to convince the authorities that she was indeed raped. His contention in the example is that it is not a case of  ad hominem  fallacy.   Alleged Rape Victim: The accused raped me. Lawyer: Is it true that the night previous to the alleged rape, you willingly slept with the accused? A R V: Yes Lawyer: In that case, why should we believe that the accused raped you?   ...  If a woman has willingly slept with the accused the night before, she wouldn't have much credibility is she claims that the accused raped her the next night.  ...  However, it would be a an ad hominem argument if we persist in disbelieving in a claim even if there is other evidence to back it up, solely because of the credibility of the person making it   In my view, Ravikiran is technically absolutely right! Ignoring an  argument/evidence in the favour of extraneous considerations such as the victim's proximity to the perpetrator or the victim's past sexual behaviour/proclivities, will make it an  argumentum ad hominem . In the absence of logical arguments and/or evidence from the victim's side, the argument does not qualify as  argumentum ad hominem .  Jivha questions Ravikiran's opinion about the 'relevance' of past sexual history of the alleged victim to the present crime. But I feel that Ravikiran's post precludes such questions by mentioning...   Now don't quibble with me saying "But that is not how I define ad hominem" My definition takes care to distinguish between a fallacy and a reaonable guess. Your's doesn't. So there.   When the past sexual history of the alleged victim is considered to be 'relevant' to the present crime, in absence of argument/evidence, it turns into a 'reasonable guess'... an extrapolation... a supposition!!  Ad Hominem fallacy involves arguing against the opponent rather than against his views or arguments. If you remove the opponent's arguments out of the equation, the moment you say anything against the opponent himself, it falls down to the level of an insult!  Being a terribly slow thinker, I still haven't figured out how  urlLink Kingsley's factor of 'intent'  fits into the picture. But I'm trying!!

"to expand the government through socialism and deliver the gains to as many people possible. This the Nehru adminstrations did to the best of their ability. It was up to the private sector to stand up and to do its job and it failed to measure up. Why blame Nehru for that ?"   I do not want to go into the abilities of Nehru as a Prime Minister and his contributions for India. I also do not understand what one means by " to expand the government through socialism ". But those are matters for a separate post some other time.  What I fail to understand is how one expects the private sector do do well when there is no incentive for it to do so and in fact when it has been weighed under by the countless barriers put up by 'socialist' governments year after year! It is a typical leftist point of view that defies the basic principles of finance and economics!  Now with the return of the Congress aided by unaccountable leftists, the concept of economic socialism is gaining currency once more!  An article in  urlLink IHT  illustrates how the CMP of the UPA government is riddled with  urlLink socialist agendas that fly in the face of common sense and economics !    "Interest rates," the text of the program promises, "will provide incentives both to the investors and savers, particularly pensioners and senior citizens."  The trouble is, investors would like to see Indian lending rates slashed by half to reach Chinese levels. Pensioners, senior citizens and factory workers want to be paid a better rate on their savings. The two objectives are irreconcilable.   Thats precisely the problem! The retrograde economic policies of the Left and the concept of economic reforms are constantly at loggerheads and trying to achieve economic progress is futile under such circumstances!    The Finance Ministry and the central bank have repeatedly said that government-administered interest rates are keeping borrowing costs too high in India. Unless rates on postal and pension savings drop, banks, which compete for the same funds, won't be able to lower their own deposit rates. Unless banks can pay less to depositors, they can't cut their lending rates.  It gets worse. The Common Minimum Program says that rural credit will be doubled over the next three years and that "immediate steps will be taken to ease the burden of debt and high interest rates on farm loans."  Banks won't bear the burden of the government's social agenda. They'll pass on the cost to corporate borrowers.   Is it too hard to realize this simple fact? Yet why do the policies of socialism form the basis of the economic agenda in the CMP?!    Without growth, the only thing the government can distribute is poverty.   Exactly!! And thats what I am afraid might happen!!

      The  urlLink Jun 21 2004 issue  of  urlLink TIME  introduces its readers to  urlLink Joe Blog . It finally jumps onto the bandwagon of news/media sites who've recognized the widespread appeal of Weblogs.   "Why are more and more people getting their news from amateur websites called blogs? Because they're fast, funny and totally biased."  ...  "What makes blogs so effective? They're free. They catch people at work, at their desks, when they're alert and thinking and making decisions. Blogs are fresh and often seem to be miles ahead of the mainstream news."  ...  "They represent  no, they are  the voice of the little guy. And the little guy is a lot smarter than big media might have you think. Blogs showcase some of the smartest, sharpest writing being published. Bloggers are unconstrained by such journalistic conventions as good taste, accountability and objectivity  and that can be a good thing."  ...  "In a way, blogs represent everything the Web was always supposed to be: a mass medium controlled by the masses, in which getting heard depends solely on having something to say and the moxie to say it."  ...  "We may be in the golden age of blogging, a quirky Camelot moment in Internet history when some guy in his underwear with too much free time can take down a Washington politician."

      Preity Zinta has something of a column on the  urlLink Beeb  website.  And I have to say that after  urlLink reading  three of her  urlLink articles  published  urlLink till date , I thought that she sounds very superficial and clichd... perhaps even vacuous. And this is not the quality of content I expect from BBC. Perhaps, Preity could start her own blog to publish her thoughts.  But at least she writes!

      It's raining GigaBytes!!!   urlLink Rediff.com  became the largest email storage provider in India when it  urlLink announced that it will provide 1 GB space to its free users and 2 GB space to its premium users  ( a 200 times increase in email space )!!  With Google and Yahoo! already down the 1 GB route, it was natural for an Indian email provider to follow them on that route.  Now, the ball is well and truly in Google's court as it needs to put its  urlLink GMail  service out for public use, before every Tom, Dick and Harry starts offering email space in GBs!! Moreover, GMail needs to stand out with some really exclusive features for people to opt for it. Otherwise, it will be hard-pressed to attract new users who would already be enjoying the sudden glut in email space!

      If you haven't got a  urlLink Gmail  account, do not despair!! Yahoo has fired its first salvo in its email battle against Google by bucking up its free mailbox size to  urlLink 100 MB . And paid users will see their mailboxes balloon up to 2 GB!! Add to that a $10 reduction in the paid-for service and what you have is serious competition for Gmail!!  The ball is now in Google's court!! Lets see what it can come up with!!

      Blogging has been touted as a potentially powerful tool for social change. Andrew Sullivan described it as   "... blogging is the first journalistic model that actually harnesses rather than merely exploits the true democratic nature of the web"    [source:  urlLink andrewsullivan.com ]  I want to try and see if these words really mean anything in the Indian context or if the potential of blogs stays just that... a potential!  There's a battle raging in the Indian blogosphere in the past few days. It started out as an innocuous  urlLink discussion  on the fallouts of BJP's loss in the recent general elections, went on to become a  urlLink debate  on what constitutes an ' urlLink  ad hominem fallacy  ' and finally  urlLink morphed  into a no-holds barred  urlLink slugfest  on the  urlLink topic  of  urlLink marital rape .  I do not want to comment on the merits and de-merits of the arguments and rants put forth in this whole debate about marital rape. Every person is entitled to his/her own views and criticizing them outright is not only boorish but also shows mental vacuity. Downplaying the horrors and the agony of rape is not only wrong but also insensitive. Similary blatantly misandrist views are grossly unfair and tend to wrongly generalize matters.   But my point is... given the chance, what kind of a law, against rape, would you formulate?! The current law under the Indian penal code stands as...   A man is said to commit "rape" who, except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the six following descriptions:-  First- Against her will.  Secondly,- Without her consent.  Thirdly-   With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested in fear of death or of hurt.  Fourthly- With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband, and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married.  Fifthly - With her consent, when, at the time of giving such consent, by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying or unwholesome substance, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent.  Sixthly - With or without her consent, when she is under sixteen years of age.  Explanation- Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the offence of rape.  Exception- Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.    [source:  urlLink indialawinfo.com ]  As can be seen from the last sentence in that excerpt, the Indian Penal Code is incompetent to handle cases of marital rape. Actually, it explicitly excludes marital rape from the definition of 'rape'. As a result, any sexual abuse, violent or non-violent, among married/dating couples and generally among members of the family, remains outside the ambit of the law.  A Task Force was set up with great fanfare, in 2000 by the Women and Child department of the Indian Government, recommended several modifications to the rape laws in India. But the task force went out with a whimper and its recommendations lie forgotten somewhere in a dusty cupboard of some government office.   Simplistically speaking, the removal of the last line from the above excerpt from the IPC would effectively open the doors for prosecution of marital rapists. But is it so simple?? Globally, marriage is considered to be an implicit consent for sexual relations with one's partner. As a result, this argument is often used by husbands while defending themselves against the charges of sexually abusing their wives. The failure of the law to unambiguously define the word 'consent' in context of sexual intercourse is one of the biggest drawbacks of the law against rape. And simply repealing the exception to the rape laws will not serve the purpose. Moreover, there is no provision in the law to take the mental faculties of the victim and the perpetrator into account. As a result, simply defining 'consent' will not suffice either. Another question that needs answering is... who will own the burden of proof? Should it be the prosecution or the defence??  I've just scratched the surface. There are so many nuances and shades to this that the mind boggles. Especially since a traditionally patriarchical society like India will find it difficult to digest the notion of a husband actually 'raping' his wife.  I would like you all to suggest ways in which the current rape law under the IPC could be modified to include marital/dating rape.  I want to see if all this noise results in some sort of a constructive activity.

       urlLink    Zinedine Zidane finds the back of the net in the 93 rd  minute of the match as France go on to score a famous famous win against England.

      In the end, it was a match to remember. It was a match that could turn the indifferent into football fanatics. For 120 minutes, two evenly matched teams slugged it out on the pitch, trading heavy blows but refusing to take a step backwards. Until... an unlikely hero carried the hopes of a nation into the semi-finals.  Portuguese goalkeeper, Ricardo, saved a crucial sudden-death penalty with his bare-hands and then struck a near-perfect kick to find the inside of the net, past the outstretched hands of a diving David James. That was enough to bury England's hopes which rose and fell with an annoying regularity throughout the match. Portugal was through to the semi-final and England was left with an early journey back home and an excuse to blame their defeat on!  Urs Meier was turned into an instant villain when he disallowed a Sol Campbell goal that could have settled the match inside the first 90 minutes. Its just over 12 hours since the England defeat and the English press has already indicted, tried and convicted the referee. And that, I think is most unfair. Meier was in perfect position to see the proceedings near the goal-mouth when Sol Campbell and John Terry went for the ball. Terry's leap was fruitless as he missed the ball which Campbell deftly headed down into the goal. While Campbell ran away from the scene in joy as the linesman gave it a goal, Meier blew his whistle to indicate otherwise. As English players, fans and commentators expressed their astonishment at the referee's decision, the replays showed that all the referee had done was to play safe. So what did the replays actually show!?  When Terry leaped up to meet the ball in mid-air, his forearm was on Ricardo's left shoulder. Terry missed the ball, but Sol Campbell did not and the ball landed inside the goal. Ricardo might have saved it and then again, he might not have. But with Terry's arm on his shoulder, he could not get off the ground to either catch the ball or to punch it away. This amounts to obstruction and even though it was in no way intentional, the fact still remains that it was a foul according to the letter of the law which makes pushing a goalkeeper a 'direct-kick' foul! In fact, strictly speaking, Terry's actions can fall into not one but three categorizations of a 'Direct Kick Foul'   * charging into an opponent (the goalkeeper can also be called for this if his action is careless, reckless or uses excessive force)  * pushing an opponent, including the goalkeeper (if careless, reckless or using excessive force)  * jumping at an opponent in a careless or reckless manner or using excessive force (this includes jumping for a header if an opponent is carelessly or recklessly bumped, and jumping at the goalkeeper)    [source:  urlLink SoccerHelp ]  Urs Meier was simply following the law. Damning him for his actions only conveys a boorish attitude on the part of the English players and supporters... and earns them a dubious tag of 'sore losers'!!  I hope that the English players and fans quit complaining and accept the fact that the deserving team won on the day. Yes, a penalty shootout is like a lottery. But then at this level, every team has to make its own luck instead of attributing their failures to referee and God!!

      With the knockout stage of Euro 2004 kicking off today, there's one thing we'll leave behind in the group matches and that is an all-square final scoreline!  With a clear result necessary for one team to progress and another to pack their bags, we'll have extra-time and penalty shoot-outs if necessary.  Thats normal, you say. What's new?!  Well many of you might not know that the usual golden goal rule will not be applied in this tournament. Instead, they're going to have a Silver Goal rule.  Here's what will happen if the two teams find themselves deadlocked with an indecisive scoreline after 90 minutes of play   *If scores are level on 90 minutes, extra time will be played and the silver goal rule will come into force.   * If a team scores a goal in the first period of extra time, play continues until the first period is complete and if one team leads, they win the match. If it is still level at the end of the first period, the second period will be played to its end and if scores are still level, there will be a penalty shootout.   * In the penalty shoot-out, each team alternately takes five spot kicks. If, after this procedure, both sides have converted the same number of penalties, kicks continue to be taken in the same order, until one team has scored one goal more than the other from the same number of kicks.

      It has taken a 20-year old, big-serving Croat, Mario Ancic, this year, to end the eternal British hopes of seeing their beloved Tim Henman win the Wimbledon title.  Ancic grew from strength to strength to cruise past Henman in straight sets, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2. With such an emphatic win over the Brit who actually looked pretty good in his last two matches, Ancic has entered the semi-finals with a bang.  Henman's loss in the quarter-finals also brings into focus his legendary inability to live upto the die-hard British hopes, year after year. Henman, an average player by any account, shoots into limelight every year when he manages to squeak through the first week, thus igniting hopes of the British fans who brave rain, cold and sun to stand patiently in queues outside the AELTC hoping to get an entry into the Center Court which hosts most of Henman's matches. And every year, without fail, Henman flatters to deceive as he almost invariably fails just before hitting the home stretch! The fans, however, ignore this trait every single time and keep on turning up for his matches in unprecedented numbers.   The atmosphere inside the Center Court during a Henman match is something to behold! Its absolutely electric... with every point that Henman wins being wildly cheered by his adoring fans. The collective oohs and aahs when he loses a point are almost farcical. Intermittent shouts of 'Come on Tim!!' resound through the court when he is winning points or losing them. His pumping fists drive his fans into raptures and when a Mexican wave starts going around the stadium, even the usually staid British royalty in the Royal Box join in. Its an experience worth waiting long hours in the queue for! I can vouch for that... after having experienced it first-hand this year.  Like strawberries 'n cream, Tim Henman and his futile attempts at going past the final couple of rounds have become somewhat of a Wimbledon tradition. And while the strawberries 'n cream at the AELTC are overrated piece of overpriced fruit, Tim Henman, at the AELTC, is an overrated specimen of underachievement.

      Japanese scientists from Ritsumeikan University in Kusatsu, Japan, have built  urlLink wheel-shaped robots that propel themselves  along by continuously altering their shape.   The rim of the wheel is made of an elastic polymer, while the spokes are made of a smart material known as a shape memory alloy, which becomes shorter when heated.   Shortening the spokes towards the front of the wheel changes its shape, causing the rim's point of contact with the ground to move backwards, behind the centre of gravity. As the wheel then tips forwards, other spokes are heated to deform the rim again and keep the robot rolling along.  Shape memory alloys store energy in the form of stresses in their crystalline structure. Passing an electric current through the spokes heats them up, releasing this energy and making them shorter. Allowing them to cool then returns the spokes to their original state.   Fascinating!!  These robots demonstrate that deformability can be a method of locomotion.

      Authorities in China have begun to  urlLink monitor and censor SMS messages . The move is allegedly to check the spread of pornographic messages and illicit news in addition to preventing deceptive advertising. But the real reason behind this blatant attack on personal freedom is to prevent the cell phone from being a tool for voicing dissent against the government's one-party rule.  This move comes after last year's exposure of the Chinese government's cover-up of the true extent of the SARS epidemic in China. It was partly due to the text messages exchanged by China's cell phone users that the cover-up by the government was exposed to the world.  With text messages coming under the microscope, will voice communication stay unmonitored for long?

      This, ladies and gentlemen, is precious!!  &nbsp;  With all the  urlLink brouhaha&nbsp;over the name  of  urlLink Lopamudra Ghatak , I decided to dig around a bit for some more  dirt  information on her. So I hopped on to our friendly neighbourhood search engine and  urlLink searched for 'Lopamudra Ghatak' . Weeding out the results pointing or referring to Economic Times, the first search result ( without any reference to the 'salmon pink coloured dishrag' ) was  urlLink this one , pointing to a message board on  urlLink Rediff.com . The said message board was&nbsp;on the article by Sucheta Dalal,&nbsp; urlLink Selling news or buying silence , which exposed the evil TOI-Medianet nexus, last year.  &nbsp;  Here's what Miss ( or Mrs., as the case may be )&nbsp;Ghatak had to say on Sucheta Dalal's expos...     Dear Sucheta,     As a journalist working with a computer publication, I thought that your article was in good stead. It is time that such stories hit the front page of national dailies, rather then being pushed to some obscure column item in page 5.  The reader expects certain level of honest and ethical reporting of incidents -- an objective view of situations, reported truthfully. That's what journalism is technically supposed to be as I was taught at my mass comm institute(IIMC, new delhi). but its quite distressing to see such prostitution of news and dishing out trash in the name of reportage.  And who cares whether Salman Khan beats up Aishwarya black and blue or pounds at her door consistently for 3 hours in the wee hours of the morning. there are numerous women in the country who get abused , at hoem, in the work place or in public. Do they ever make it to the front page of any daily?  Its high time that the readers are stopped being taken for granted and fed nonsense news, day after day.      [emphasis mine]      What can I say?!! ... I leave you, gentle readers, to ponder over her statements, while I burst out laughing!!  &nbsp;  *ROTFL*

      A report by a panel of scholars appointed by the new HRD ministry in their efforts to  urlLink de-saffronise Indian education , has indicated that saffronisation of the history texts used in schools was a minor matter as compared to the  urlLink 'Northanization' of Indian history  by parochial writers with 'a strong north-India bias'.   Evidence: Of the 89 pages devoted to the study of Ancient History of India, not even nine full pages are spared for the history of peninsular India. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka together have preserved a corpus of over 50,000 inscriptions, but not even a passing reference is made to this enviable wealth, even where the sources of history are discussed.   The panel contrasts this with the reality: An estimated 1,050 CBSE schools teach this course (and follow this text) in the four states of South India and two union territories (Kerala: 489, Andhra Pradesh: 350, Tamilnadu : 150, Karnataka: 35; Lakshadweep: 10 and Andaman: 15).   To all these students, the text has nothing to offer about the land in which they are born and brought up, and also in which the majority of them spend the rest of their lives. As long as history is imposed from above, in this manner, without involving the scholarship of the rest of the country, the history of India is bound to be a meaningless exercise.   The report also does criticize the exclusion of certain facts relating to Muslim movements in the Indian history, pointing to 'saffronisation' of the books. But the major emphasis is on the 'north-Indian' bias that was introduced in the books by the previous government.

      Some say the job market is opening up fast in the US. Some say its booming. So you think about posting resumes to US job consultants with the hopes of snagging a job or two in the land of opportunity. Well thats what a lot of my friends have been doing these days.   But then if you read  urlLink The Economic Times   ( and horror of horrors, believe it ), you'd be worried to death about going to the US for a techie job!!   A story at the start of this month says its a  urlLink tough call for geeks to either relocate or quit ! A few days later... another story appears... which paints a bleak picture of what happens  urlLink when even IT pros lose their jobs . Almost immediately after this, the focus shifts to the Techies' parents, who are described as being a  urlLink lonely lot  by our friendly neighbourhood financial newspaper ( or salmon pink coloured dishrag, but I repeat myself! ). Perhaps that is why it reports that  urlLink Indian techie eves are on their way home . And perhaps due to the combined effects of an exodus of Indian women techies ( who, the financial toilet-paper claims, are not driven by any fanatical desire to be Silicon Valley residents ) and arrival of pink slips in the DINK households,  urlLink marriages of Indian pros are breaking up ! Ohh the woe!!   And now even the  urlLink US techies managing the Indian IT pros are beginning to grumble . They grumble about about everything that has to do with Indians... the time-management, fake accents, clannish attitudes, easily amused nature and even the gold belt buckles!! Frankly speaking... this article does nothing to project the clannish attitudes that Indians harbour while abroad. Rather it comes across as a conversation between a group of bitchy Yanks! The article ends with a revelatory statement... "(This is a true transcript of a conversation)". Well... I'll eat my hat if it was a real-life conversation!!   One notable feature about these articles is that they all been authored by the same person, a certain Lopamudra Ghatak. Either this author is a crusader of some sort or there is some sort of a hidden agenda behind such a string of articles within the space of two weeks! ... Or maybe I'm just a conspiracy theorist!!

      Michael Schumacher is a great driver. He's the best there is and probably among the best there ever were!  But is he the best there ever was?!  If all you hear are the fawning paeans sung in his praise by lakhs of Johnny-come-latelies who call themselves F1 fanatics, you'd be convinced that indeed, Schumi is the greatest Formula One driver that ever walked this planet.  At least the author of  urlLink this article on Rediff.com , Raja Sen, seems to think so.   It's just that a certain man has taken it unto his tremendously able hands to do just that: The Impossible. Michael Schumacher, it cannot be argued, produces miracles - full-blooded crimson spectacles of incredible prestidigitation - at will. He smiled from the top step of the podium yet again, with the customary wink comfortably in place, and this was a man enjoying himself thoroughly. Shrugging off the plaudits as the incredulous journalists jostled for query-room, he smirked: "No risk, no fun." That statement sums a lot up for the Ferrari driver, who is now basking in the thrill of the greatest competition he has ever had to face: Himself.    sic!  I'd much rather listen to the views of my best friend,  urlLink Saurabh , who is, in my opinion, the biggest F1 fan I have ever come across. The reason... his impeccable credentials to comment on Formula One...   Die hard fans like me, who have followed Formula - 1 (F-1) since 1984 (a whopping 20 years) have seen the evolving and diminishing careers of greats like Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Niki Lauda, Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill, Jacques Villeneuve, Jean Alesi, Gerhard Berger, Mika Hakkinen, Juan Pablo Montoya, Fernando Alonso, Mark Webber and Kimi Raikonnen. These drivers have evolved F-1 into the sport it is today.   I have no doubt Schumi is a terrific driver. But his fans continue make the mistake of running down other greats in trying to glorify a driver who is great, but not quite the greatest. Raja Sen writes...   Contrary to popular belief, he has faced a few competitors in his time. Senna, Hill, Villeneuve, Irvine, Hakkinen, Montoya, Raikonnen, Alonso. He beat them all. Hard, hammering defeat into their skulls with monotonous consistency. A couple took the upper hand, but then were beaten, and bowed out after the ignominy of repeated defeat dulled the luster of their momentary crowns. Now, Michael competes with himself: which is to say that he pushes himself harder than ever to race better than ever. His benchmark is his glorious past, and the resultant bar is so high that the great Fangio himself would think twice before attempting it, and possibly even retreat to a nice plate of cannelloni.   Such disrespect for drivers whom you've never seen driving! Sen shows his immaturity by clubbing Senna and Fangio in the same bracket as Irvine, Alonso and Villeneuve. For anyone who claims to be a F1 fan, this is an insult to their intelligence!! Furthermore, Sen comments about the nature of F1...   There are people, I am sure, who found the French Grand Prix boring. I feel sorry for these folk, and earnestly suggest they switch [recently-developed, obviously] allegiance to less-cerebral sports such as one of the brutishly vulgar American racing leagues. Formula One, the pinnacle of motorsport, has always been about battles inside the brains - a plethora of brilliant thinkers are to be credited for each race win, and it is to see the machinations of these superlative thinkers that we live, and should be thankful. The greatest drivers of their eras have not necessarily been the fastest, but the ones most precise, the ones able to outthink. Which is why Prost always had the indubitable edge in his legendary rivalry with the Brazilian.   But people fail to realize how much ( or rather, how little ) effort today's drivers have to put in while driving a F1 car. Saurabh explains...   From no re-fuelling, no pit stop strategy, racing slicks with different widths for front and rear tires, single tire manufacturer, no ABS, no traction control, no launch control, no automatic and semi automatic gearboxes, F-1 is vastly different than what it has been a decade ago. Older F-1 drivers had to wrestle the car to stay on track while changing gears fighting to keep a 1300 bhp turbo-charged monster under control. (Todays F-1 cars are a measly 900 bhp). Manhandling these mean machines was a tiring effort and drivers used to collapse from sheer exhaustion after a race was completed.  F-1 drivers these days hardly have to do anything other than yawn while in the car. The in-car footage shows the drivers hardly moving the steering. It looks like my grand mother serenely driving along. As Niki Lauda remarked in 2003, even a monkey can drive a modern formula 1 car.   Add to this, the vastly superior use of telemetry and other electronics that make up the car nowadays and you have a driver who has to do nothing other than floor the accelerator and follow the instructions from the team paddock to the 'T'. Where then, is the 'thinking' that Raja Sen seems to credit Schumacher with, required?! By his own admission, the troika of Brawn, Todt and Schumacher are the executors of the strategies... strategies that are honed to perfection with the use of the immense computing power at the disposal of super-rich teams like Ferrari.  Saurabh posts more arguments showing how Schumacher has been molly-coddled by FIA and the stewards over the years. Reading them makes you realize that Schumi has feet of clay after all.  In any case, Raja Sen glorifies the car at the expense of the driver's abilities and dilutes his arguments in favour of Schumi as the greatest driver ever. Saurabh, however, finishes off his arguments gracefully... acknowledging Schumi's greatness while quietly asserting Senna's genius.   I hold Michael Schumacher in very high esteem but I am not a fan. I just think that he is a very lucky racer. His ship sails smooth while his opponents frequently run into rough weather and end up a beached whales. His timing, right from his appearance in F-1 was impeccable. He has a strong personality. He is the rightful heir to Sennas throne.   No doubt, that Schumacher is the best of todays crop of racers. However, he is simply not the best there ever was. Personally, I think Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark and Ayrton Senna were the best there ever were.   How I wish that on May 1, 1994 at Imola, the suspension arm from a front wheel of a Williams car had missed the visor of the famous yellow helmet!

      Rajeev Srinivasan's latest piece on  urlLink Rediff.com  is an insigthful look at the subtle signs of a superpower on the wane and considers India's candidature as a possible  urlLink power center in a multipolar world .  I like the structured nature of his arguments, be it while describing the subtle ways in which the US will find its position, as the pre-eminent power in the world, threatened or when he illustrates how India should recognize its strengths and the impresive lineage it boasts and mould itself into a power centre, albeit in a local sense at first.  But he starts rambling a little towards the end where he includes a postscript thats relatively irrelevant to the article. :-P   Postscript:  Now for an irrelevant postscript of my own! I wonder why a person who writes for Rediff.com would give a Gmail id for receiving feedback rather than a Rediffmail one?! ;-)

      The Sept 11 panel confirms what everyone has known forever - that  urlLink Pakistan has had close links with Osama Bin Laden .  But the panel, quite puzzlingly, goes on to recommend long-term military and other aid to Pakistan, inspite of its tendency to get cozy with the terrorists!!  The panel blames Pakistan's links with Osama on the endemic poverty in the country...   "Pakistan's endemic poverty, widespread corruption, and often ineffective government create opportunities for Islamist recruitment...Millions of families, especially those with little money, send their children to religious schools or madrassas. Many of these schools are the only opportunity available for an education, but some have been used as incubators for violent extremism,"   Oh thats just great, isn't it?! When it comes to Pakistan, its the poverty that drives them to terrorism. When it comes to other countries, its their fundamentalist Islamic ideologies! Talk about having different standards for different people!! :-|  Don't these people realize that even though Musharraf seems to be rooting out the terrorists ( mind you, only the ones that are hurting the US! ), the army wields trememdous power in Pakistani politics. And it is this army that controls the ISI and its shady going-ons. So in giving military aid to Pakistan, the US is, in the long term, funding terrorism against itself!!  Ironic... yes! Stupid... yes! Bush... of course!!

      Arun Shourie talks about how, the present governor of Uttar Pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a  urlLink " third Islamic State " in the subcontinent .  T V Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and the present governor of Uttar Pradesh had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in The Hindustan Times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says,   Does the fact that you now know that he, and not I, to say nothing of Mr Advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? Or do you conclude that because he wrote in this refrain, T V Rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as Governor of Uttar Pradesh?   Should he too be dismissed from his post of Governor because, as will be clear from the expressions he used in these articles, his ideology is not compatible with the ideology that the new Government and its props profess?   In fact, Rajeswar had gone public with these warnings for good reason. For three of them, actually. First, the entire Northeast, much of Bengal and Bihar are indeed being inundated by this demographic aggression. Second, as Rajeswar documented, apart from everything else this swamping constitutes a grave threat to national security. Third, he had been trying in vain to awaken successive Prime Ministers and Home Ministers to the menace. To no avail.   In doing so, he indirectly indicts his own government too.   But that is not the point!  The point is... now that Rajeswar will formally hand over his report to Home Minister, Shivraj Patil, will the government sit up and take serious note of this threat that has the potential to become another headache for India which is already suffering from the never-ending Kashmir problem!

      One of main justifications for the war against Iraq was supposed to be the links between Iraq and Al Qaeda. Time and time again, all the top officials in the Bush administration had claimed that there was 'overwhelming' proof that there were extensive ties between Saddam Hussein and Osama's terror organization, Al Qaeda.  &nbsp;  But the Sept. 11 commission (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States) concluded that it found  urlLink no 'collaborative relationship' between Iraq and Al Qaeda .  &nbsp;  Now, rumblings are starting to increase, about the  urlLink alleged links between Iran and Al Qaeda . Evidence of these purported links has been uncovered by the same Sept. 11 commission. The evidence suggests that      eight and ten of the 14 "muscle" hijackersthat is, those involved in gaining control of the four 9/11 aircraft and subduing the crew and passengerspassed through Iran in the period from October 2000 to February 2001.   At the same time,&nbsp;the commission has not found any evidence to suggest that Iran knew about the Al Qaeda plans to carry out the 9/11 attacks.  &nbsp;  George W. Bush has meanwhile asserted that  urlLink US is actively investigating  ties between the Iranian government and Al Qaeda.     Mr. Bush noted in a brief Oval Office meeting with reporters that the Central Intelligence Agency had found "no direct connection between Iran and the attacks of Sept.11," but he said "We will continue to look and see if the Iranians were involved."     &nbsp;  Iran, on the other hand, claims that  urlLink it has dismantled the Al Qaeda network  in&nbsp;the country - a claim that has not really been validated with any evidence from the Iranians.  &nbsp;  While Iran may have passively assisted the Al&nbsp;Qaeda operatives in their endeavours, it remains to be seen if the US can prove its claims&nbsp;of the seemingly tenuous&nbsp;links between Iran and&nbsp;Osama's terror network. After all, the shrill voices that bayed vociferously, claiming Iraq's links with Al Qaeda have now had to eat a humble pie! It remains&nbsp;to be seen if there is any substance in the US claims or is it just another case of&nbsp;Bush crying ' wolf! '  &nbsp;  And all the while, with Pakistani&nbsp;forces&nbsp;hunting Al Qaeda operatives all across the country,&nbsp;the US continues to turn a blind eye to the&nbsp;obvious links between Pakistan and Al Qaeda!  &nbsp;

      These days when India plays a cricket match, with Zaheer Khan in the team, it's almost certain that he will pull one of his thigh/calf muscles and be ruled out of the remainder of the tournament! &nbsp; And he did not disappoint this time! He was ruled out of the upcoming match against Bangladesh, in the ongoing Asia Cup tournament, with  urlLink an injury to his quadriceps muscle . And that too... right at the start of the cricket season! &nbsp; Its not funny!! I wonder when players will stop faking their fitness to gain an entry into the national team. I thought that this was a phenomenon of the past with the new crop of players knowing about the hazards of faking injuries! &nbsp; And it does raise serious doubts about the abilities of the team doctor and physio in ascertaining the fitness of the players and ,indeed, helping them maintain their fitness levels.

      The Ghatkopar bomb blasts case is all set to  urlLink go the same way as the Mulund blasts case . The accused have signed an application saying that they have no faith in the court.   This is similar to the written application filed by Saquib Nachan, the prime accused in the Mulund bomb blast case. Nachan successfully managed to stall the court proceedings by claiming in his application that he had no faith in the POTA judge A P Bhangale.  By doing this, the accused have effectively ridiculed the authority of the court and in turn, the authority of law. And its sickening to know that these scum are managing to get away with it too!  I have very rudimentary knowledge of law, but this sounds like a candidate for 'contempt of court' to me. The Contempt of Courts Act of 1971 states that...   criminal contempt means  the publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which     (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise, or  lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court ; or  (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or  (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner    [emphasis mine]  Well?!

      Apple will unveil the latest iPod later this week. Newsweek  urlLink reviews the new iPod  to find that...   It looks a bit different, operates more efficiently, has a few more features and costs less.   This new baby is thinner and sports a new menu that feels like the one on the iPod mini.

A whopping $100 reduction in the prices (across the board) mean that the iPod is all set to ramp up its existing share of 50% of the digital music player market.  Now... I can think of buying myself one! ;-)

      While on one hand John Kerry has been advocating  urlLink lesser outsourcing  and returning jobs to Americans, he does not seem to be averse to  urlLink outsource his campaign to foreign nationals .   urlLink David Radulski  poses an interesting question...   Then again, doesn't bringing in underpaid (unpaid?) foreign workers mean that a US professional campaign canvasser has lost his or her job?  Btw, I do realize that there's a big difference between a 'worker' and a 'volunteer'.  One of the commenters on David's post raises another interesting hypothetical question...    Suppose a foreign government truly wanted a particular candidate to win...  What is to prevent them from recruiting an army of 'volunteers' and sending them here to work for that candidate's campaign? They could mask their financing as some sort of sweepstakes for which there would be many prizes of an all expenses paid six-month stay in the U.S.. Conveniently that six months could start in June or July, ideal for college age "volunteers".  Now  that  is interesting! A perfectly shaped loophole to sneak through if you're a sneaky country with an agenda to swing voters' opinions armed with a swarm of fresh-faced young people with good 'persuasive' powers! Stuff that conspiracy theories are made of!! ;-)

      For those Indians who continue to think that Kerry is the man to support for the top job in America, here's one more reason to think twice about that viewpoint.  Speaking at the Democratic convention (the one where bloggers have been given  urlLink a position of preeminence ), Kerry spoke, among other things, about closing loopholes in US tax laws so that incentives will no longer be available for companies that ship jobs to other countries. Which effectively means a blow to outsourcing and in turn... a blow to Indian interests.  One of  urlLink Gaurav's posts  gives more reasons on why Kerry should not be an Indian choice as the US president.  Another thing that Kerry said during the convention... i.e. " The tax breaks given to the rich by the Bush administration will be rolled back under Kerry's plan, and that money would be invested in job creation, health care and education " reminds of a  urlLink recent post by Yazad  which considers the concept of 'job-creation' as a wrong goal to work towards.

      A former Pakistani Test player has alleged that  urlLink the India-Lanka tie was fixed .  I am not surprised. Someone or the other usually crawls out of the woodwork in Pakistan and makes these claims everytime an Indian win hurts the interests of the Pakistani team.  Perhaps the idiot did not know that the biggest reason for India's advance into the final was the terrible mis-calculation on the Pakistani team's part when India managed to scramble past 241 in their match against Pakistan. The bonus point that India received in that match was the nail in the Pakistani team's coffin... and not the Indian win against Sri Lanka ( that was just the final straw on the camel's back ).  In any case, its strange to see this player crowing about the ACC and the ICC while Javed Miandad is blaming Pakistan's mis-fortunes on their new coach Bob Woolmer!

      In these days of e-mail scams, hoaxes and spoofs, its very difficult to trust emails from anyone who wishes to part with a lot of money. Remember the Nigerian e-mail scam and how it fooled a  urlLink lot of gullible people &nbsp;or the hoax mails from  urlLink banks or PayPal .   These hoaxes&nbsp;played on...     People's fears by cautioning them about a security policy update that required them to send personal information.  or people's greed by offering them vast amounts of money in exchange&nbsp;for a small initial investment on their part.   What people do not know is that they can avoid getting fooled in this manner by carrying a few elementary checks on the Internet.    The simplest way is to cut 'n paste the subejct of the email they've received in the search box of our favourite  urlLink search engine . More often than not you'll come across a search result that leads you to a page which has more information on whether that email you received was a hoax or genuine ( These emails are, almost always, discussed on online forums. )  Another method is to go to the official website of the organization that the email has purportedly come from. Once there, find out a contact&nbsp;email address and forward the e-mail you've received to that address asking them to confirm if the e-mail is genuine.   The best way is to go to the  urlLink Urban Legends Reference Page  and search if there is any information available there. Usually, you'll find reliable information there stating if the e-mail is genuine or a hoax.   This morning, when I checked my inbox, I found an e-mail from  urlLink PayPal . It was&nbsp;titled, "Notice of Pendency of Class Action and Proposed Settlement". It referred to a class action suit against PayPal ( Case No. 02 1227 JF PVT, pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose ) which alleged that PayPal had violated the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) by not disclosing to its customers, dispute resolution procedures. As a result, any PayPal members who had joined the service between Oct 1999 and Jan 2004 were entitled to Injunctive and Monetary Relief and should go to  urlLink https://www.paypal.com/settlement/ &nbsp;( which is redirected to   urlLink  http://www.settlement4onlinepayments.com/  ).  I was naturally&nbsp;suspicious about this e-mail. So I ' urlLink Googled ' for it and found vague references to it on various online forums. Most of these forums indicated that this was a genuine case and I also got a link to a  urlLink news item  about the PayPal class action suit. To be doubly sure that this was not a case of someone using the class action suit to scam&nbsp;PayPal customers,&nbsp;I went to the PayPal site ( which is   urlLink  https://www.paypal.com   &nbsp;...&nbsp;please note&nbsp;the https ) and found&nbsp;a helpful e-mail address ( urlLink spoof@paypal.com ). I forwarded the e-mail, I had received,&nbsp; to this address asking them to advise if it was genuine. To my surprise, in just about a couple of minutes, I received a reply from them ( obviously an autoresponder )... the contents of which read...     Dear Sameer,  Thank you for contacting PayPal.  Thank you for bringing the "Notice of Pendency of Class Action and Proposed Settlement email to our attention. We can confirm that PayPal sent this email. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.  ...   Straight from the horse's mouth! Now that settled the matter for me. :-)  In case you're not still convinced and want to be triply sure... have a  urlLink look at this .

Ganguly's decision to throw the ball to Zaheer Khan for the final over turned out to be a successful move ( especially after the 21 run rollicking that Jayasuriya gave Zaheer in his 4th over ). And as we know... nothing succeeds like success!! :-)  Chalk one up for, arguably, the best captain in the world of cricket today.

      Conducting interviews for tiny tots seeking admissions to kindergarten or pre-primary classes, is a totally unfair practice that schools have been adopting for a long time now. The reasons, why this practice is unfair, are:  1. Competition for marks/grades has grown to such an extent that it exists not only among students but also among the schools. In this game of oneupmanship, schools try to 'select' only those students that show the potential to bring glory to the school in a few years time.  2. Schools that run on private funding do not wish to 'waste' their resources on students who are slow on the uptake or those who would not provide the school with adequate returns on the school's investment ( see point 1 )  3. Little students have to travel long distances to reach schools just because the school in their neighbourhood refused admission on the basis of an interview. As a result, kids end up travelling during the time that they ought to spend playing or enjoying themselves.  4. Schools use the interviews as a convenient excuse to ask for donations. Affluent parents can afford to get their kid admitted in schools even though he/she might've failed the interview. Not-so-affluent parents have to go looking for other schools for their kids.  I know that the reasons I've stated above smack a bit of leftist thinking. But I firmly believe that primary education should be free from monetary and competitive considerations to an extent. Which is why, I am glad to note that the  urlLink Delhi High Court has issued notices to the Central Government and the National Educational Planning and Administration  in connection with a petition seeking a ban on interviews for admission to kindergarten/pre-primary classes.   Now I hope this translates into a ban on such interviews.
