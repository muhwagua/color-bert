       And every time you feel like crying I'm gonna try and make you laugh And if I can't  If it just hurts too bad Then we'll wait for it to pass And I will keep you company for those days so long and black  And we'll keep working on the problem We know we'll never solve Of love's uneven remainders Our lives are fractions of a whole But if the world could remain within a frame Like a painting on a wall Then I think we'd see the beauty then We'd stand staring in awe    Bright Eyes   Might go to Bread Co. tomorrow. Might go to summer school this summer.    I can fail before I ever try.     .heart.

       Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) You are likely to be feeling especially friendly, outgoing and warm today, dear Pisces, people you meet, particularly those you meet through groups, are likely to be strongly attracted to you and want to form bonds with you. Friendships, partnerships, and romantic relationships should continue to grow closer, enhanced by your high level of communication. In the evening: Go out with those you love. Your bonds will be stronger for it.   Skyler came over yesterday: Didn't have time to write.  And, hey, my horoscope was right. Marc came over tonight and he put his arm around me, tickeled me.. all that flirty stuff. He, of course, has a girlfriend and told me not to tell anyone. He smelled my hair and put his arms around me and held me. I really needed that, I forgot how good it felt.   "It's okay to snuggle just... don't tell anyone..."    .heart.

       Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) There are opportunities open to you now, dear Pisces, whether you realize it or not. In fact, it may be quite hard to be aware of them today given the astrological weather. Your emotions may feel a bit restricted and weighted down and you may get the feeling like something is really trying to tie you down to earth. Realize that this is just a message from the universe reminding you that having at least one foot on the ground is key to manifesting your dreams   My soul feels heavy today. So do my feet.  I went to bed at 10 p.m., didn't fall asleep till midnight. Woke up at 5, took a shower, fed dogs, let them out.. looked everywhere for my Chemistry book for my homework I woke up early for. Couldn't find it anywhere. I need to find it or $50 will be going to the school.   Skyler's coming over tomorrow.  I came home today and Judy's mom was laying on the couch.... she knows our garage door number, so I guess she just comes in and lays on our couch now? She had my dog, too. It's kind of like.. "uh.. what are you doing here?" But we were taught to be polite even if someone invites themselves over. But really, I want her to leave. She has no business coming without calling -- and even more so, when no one is home?  Lack of sleep is getting to me, I know I'm being crabby.  Christian is starting to flirt with me and I feel like crying. I wrote him a note once giving my heart away. He tore it up. He's starting to slip in "I love you" into his sentances. He really shouldn't say things he doesn't mean. He has a band and asked me to go to his show, whenever it is. I said sure and he acted like a little boy that just got a toy car. "Really?! Promise?!" I can't like him again. =/  I really do mean it when I say I love Skunky. He's so original you can't help but love him. You'll never, ever meet another soul  close  to his.   Some girl at school said David does drugs. I corrected her immediatly. He doesn't, I know he doesn't. He hangs out with me all day, and plus he just had a drug test so Judy could prove to the therapist that her baby boy was clean.  I don't have much more to say.   Mon coeur fatigue    .heart.

       Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) Turn up the dial on your fantasy button and let your imagination run wild. Your intuition is strong today, dear Pisces, and you should give your emotions room to flow. Work to clear the blockages that might be preventing you from doing the things you truly want to do. Get your ideas down on paper and manifest more of your fantasy world here on earth. People may be rather stingy, so now is not the best time to ask for a raise or a loan.    I'm getting annoyed by my horoscope always including  dear Pisces . I know what sign I am, I don't need it included.  My fantasy button? I guess I've been holding back, but not too much. Yes, I've been botteled up, but only because I don't want to cry over Stuart -- again. I'm finally starting to talk to him again, and wow, I wish he was mine.  I'm confused about it, though. I  do  like him,  alot , but I know I told Dani I was over him. I really don't think I'll  ever  be  over  him, but I'll shut up for another year or two until I spill my guts again just so he gets a chance to try to scoop them back up and sew me back together. He's never completely successfull, and I feel it everytime I see him, everytime he smiles at me.  Everytime.   Kyle called for David. I want to encourage David to invite him over, but I don't want him to get suspicious. I just want to  see  him, that's all. Wonder what he looks like.  I got weighed at school today. 107.  I weighed myself at home today. 128. Something isn't right. 107 sounds good though, doesn't it? I'll weigh some 5lb weights on my scale, see if it's right.   I fantasize myself to sleep at night    .heart.

       Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) Take a look at what is going on around you today, dear Pisces, and do some internal processing before you reach a conclusion regarding the best way to proceed. You may find that a combination of powerful forces is at work, trying to win you over to their respective camp. Don't pigeon hole yourself into only one way of doing things. Keep in mind that the best route to take is often times a combination of several different paths.   Good advice, especially since finals are sneaking up.  Today wasn't as bad as I anticipated and tomorrow is gym. Square dancing. I hope we at least don't have to change out for  square dancing.  It would also be pretty rad if there were hot guys in my gym class, but, eh, what are you going to do?  David's at the doctor's office, discussing the effects of his two week trial with Paxil. That makes three out of four of us on anti-depressants. Runs in the family, and so do addictive personalities. See a problem there? Cancer and diabetes also run in the family.   Then again,  what family?   I should go study for my finals.    Looks like somebody's got a case of the Mondays     .heart.

       I didn't  jog .   I kinda knew I wouldn't.  I  should've.  I also  should've  opened my bookbag at least  once  during Christmas break. I'm  freaking out  right now.  Scared  about school. I do this  alot.   So I'm here to get my mind  OFF  of school.  I really should've jogged. It would've made me tired and I could've just melted into bed. I  never  melt.    I usually  cut  to get my mind off of things. I told myself I had stopped that but really over break there's not much to stress over or cut yourself about.   Self-injury is not suicidal or dangerous. It could be but not how I do it. If I wanted to kill myself I  would.    I think I'll  throw  myself into some artwork.    Highschool sucks & blows     .heart.

       Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) It is time to come up for air, dear Pisces. Come out of your watery existence for the day and take a deep breath. Experience the lightness and rejuvenation of the energy that is present in the air around you. Do a set of yoga or go for a jog in order to open up your channels and get your circulation moving. Use this exercise to clear your mind and open your consciousness to allow for new ideas and dreams to be born from within.   Good idea. I should do that after dinner. Or maybe when Larry gets back with the dogs from dropping David off at his friend, Kyle's, house. I haven't met Kyle yet, but of course since i heard him and David work together, are in the same classes and all I guess I'll be meeting him soon enough. Maybe he's who I've been looking for.. ? Wow, I  need  a little emo boy.   School starts up again tomorrow. I won't be getting much sleep tonight.   Kevin was having a panic attack last night once we started talking about finals. He didn't realize they were so soon. Him and I are alot alike -- get overly anxious about school. My chest tightens and it's hard to breath, my heart beats faster... makes me sick to my stomach.  Larry is home. I should go before he starts standing over me like a watch dog.    xoxo      .heart.

       Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) This is an excellent day for you, dear Pisces, and you will find that things will automatically be flowing your way. You will find that you will receive more attention from people than usual and that you are the center of any social gathering. The one difficult point for you might be intimate relations to others. Romantic issues are apt to take on a more serious, grounded tone at this time.   I was the center of attention, once. When I was born. I hate all the attention, I'm too stupid to really say anything clever.  I slept half my day away.  I love dreaming.   Got up, played a few video games, took a shower, got dressed. Laundry room had flooded, Larry pissed, cleaned up, Judy came home, and.. now. Writing.  Last night I told David "Skunky" Rogers that I love him.  "Hey dude thanks I love you too, yo"  It's better he thinks I met it as 'pals'. He surprised me that night, too. I was signed on both of my screen names, {PreschoolRomance + TurnUpTheWeez}, and he wrote with every other word a small goodbye. "Shallom" "Allie" "I" "love" "you" "goodnight" Ech.. Eighteen year olds.. I'm a child in his eyes but I'm not really sure what I am in my eyes.  Last night I also decided I should go on a diet. So all I dreamed about was food. I was really a jerk in my dream, too. Yelling at whoever was serving me.   I had another dream, too. I was losing my hair. I thought I had cancer but I wouldn't say anything to anyone. It was obvious I was getting bald spots but my 'family' seemed to just.. ignore me and let me die..  I woke up and layed in bed for an hour.  On another note, I figured I should mention exactly how I stumbeled across a blog.  Searching 'emo boy' in  urlLink   and I found a blog:  emo_boy began to cry.(he seems to cry often)   "just when i begin to think the whole world isn't totlaly against me, it find out it is!!"   i quicklky remarked, "emo_boy, you know that just isn't true...just think, your girlfriend loves you more than anything ever could. you always used to say she was the sunshine after the ice storm! so how could you let such depressing garbage come out of that mouth??"   "she dumped me"   "so what...girls always go around dumping people. even if they're not going out!! it's what they like to do. heck...if i were a girl, i'd probably like dumping people too. see? so it's not soo bad...just be glad you're not a girl who is totally confused at all times about how she feels...see? that's another reason to be happy. and you know another thing? we can use urinals. girls can't use urinals...at least, properly. So there obiously are some good things going for you if you would only look."   and with that last comment, a larger-than-life black "brotha" came up behind me, and slapped me across the back of my head. it hurt.   Made me laugh. I put it on my stlpunk page:  urlLink    There's not much more to say, so I think I'll close on this note:    MegaMan is a pimp      .heart.

       Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com) Other people may tend to snap under the emotional pressure of the day, dear Pisces, but you will find that you are well suited towards soaring through with flying colors. You are ruled by your emotions and you have no problem navigating rough waters. Other people may look to your for strength and support. Trust yourself and try not to get lured off course by conflicting opinions that don't seem to sit right with your psyche.    I'm not as strong as the horoscope says, but I need something to believe in.   Hell restarts on Monday.That's when my new born soul dies.---Maybe I wouldn't hate school so much if it didn't hate me so much.  Only fourteen. I hate my age. It seems like everything collapses on you, the weight of the world crushes your spirit.  Judy ("Mom") tells me how she just  can't stand  Larry's ("Dad's") snoring, his stubborness, his short fuse. "I'll have to sleep in another room, and that's not good for marriages."   What marriage?    Larry tells me how Judy bosses him around, talks too much, isn't sensible.  They expect their  fourteen year old  daughter   to fix everything. I'm not  Wonder Woman . I'm not even  Mighty Mouse . Maybe a divorce is all they're  looking  for.  I never thought I'd make it this far, though. Fourteen. I never thought I'd make it to fifth grade. I can never see the future coming, even though I dream about it so often: A cute neighbor boy is  suppose  to move in, somehow thinks I'm "beautiful", falls in love with me.. and, wow.. just make my life  perfect .  Well, a neighbor boy  did  move in, but not what I was looking for. He wasn't looking for me, either. Marc has a girlfriend, but is still able to twirl my emotions around his finger.  "I miss you, Allie. Why don't you come and visit anymore?"  It doesn't matter anymore. Right now I just want some friends that will understand me.  I hate how I can never  really  seem to be happy with anything -- especially myself. (Side note: I think especially should be spelled ecspecially.) I look in the mirror and my cheeks get wet. I've puked, not ate, cut, drugged myself.. seems like I'll do anything besides talk to someone about it. Maybe if someone cared to listen or notice.  Larry has found my old prescription drugs in my room.. bloody razors, boxcutters.... doesn't suspect a thing.  I don't know  what  I'm doing with myself. I hadn't planned on living  this  long.  Everyday I live I feel like I'm fake, in someone elses body, under someone elses skin, pretending to be happy. Like I'm trapped in a hole, and everyone is looking down on me, but no one will offer me a hand out.  Once I stop looking for love I'll find it, but my heart is so empty love is the only thing I can think about.     Sweet Dreams,     .heart.

       He took it all too far, but boy, could he play guitar   making love with his ego     Saturday  was a lot of fun. Brett's birthday party, plus I got to see my friend T.j. that moved away to Illinois. (I'm in Missouri.) Mike D. was there, too, and he was still pretty flirty with me. It was a good time and got my mind off of my home life.  Oh, I don't think David and I are fighting anymore, if you even want to call it fighting. We were just ignoring eachother. He.. well.. not really apologized.. but we never do.. we act like nothing happened.  Judy and I went out to Kohl's yesterday and got me some new clothes that I really needed. 3 pairs of pants and 4 t-shirts = $114.00 It's a birthday present. My birthday is on Tuesday, I hope everyone forgets it so I won't have to act happy and I can pretend it's a normal day.    I really don't like all that attention.    .heart.

       So sick, so sick, so sick of bein' tired and oh-so tired of being sick we're such magnificant liars so crush me, baby, I'm all ears.   I apparently betrayed David without even realizing it. I sat outside his door while he begged my parents, " please, just let me  die  " He blames me for losing his will to live. I know he's mentally sick right now, anyone that has a serious discussion with him can tell. That's what hurts the most, is he can't think straight. I've lost him.   He said he didn't care about me.  I really am just trying not to think about it.   I'm proud of myself for not cutting.  Cried in French today, and on the bus. I'm so easy to ignore, no one noticed.  It's times like these when I wish I could just be wrapped up in  someone's  arms and just forget about this mess.    Afterall... Every thug needs a lady    .heart.    p.s... incase you were in the mood for something hopeless: I had a dream Stuart was actually interested in me.. he gave me flowers and Weezer tickets.. sweet gent, eh?

       light   hearted   light   headed   hearts, stars and horseshoes, clovers and blue moons. Pots of gold and rainbows, and me red balloons!  Poured some cereal only to realize we're out of milk. I hate it when that happens.  I hate the "reality" t.v. shows. I'm not even sure why they call it a reality t.v. show when it's not realistic at all. Doesn't anyone enjoy scripted television anymore?  How would you abbreviate assassination? I don't think it's possible.  I know I'm so emotionally drained I really can't stay on one topic for too long, sorry. But hey, at least it's keeping me from thinking about how horrible my life is right now.  It occured to me that I am most likely talking to myself, and hey, that's cool, but if anyone is reading this and feels like contacting me for some unknown reason, here you go: AIM S/N: TurnUpTheWeez and PreschoolRomance E-Mail: DansinWithMyself0@swbell.net  You can also visit my stlpunk website to see photos of me, or see what else I might have to say: http://www.stlpunk.com/u_profile.asp?userID=21793  Wow, I feel like a corny PBS t.v. show.

       Stayed home today...   Cried, slept, and ate.  David stayed home, too, but he spent his day trying to make  me  feel better.   allison is really upset with this family and i understand where she is coming from. now that everyone else feels like crap i just wish we could all feel better. i love allison with all my heart and i would give anything to make her feel better. i just wish i knew what would.   -David's journal  They don't understand I just want to be alone and sleep and forget about all of this.  I hate it when they give me sympathy.  I hate it when they give me  any  attention.  I'm better off alone.  I'm better off dead.   I've been reading David's online diary: http://www.digitalexpressions.nu/viewdiary.php?DID=25027 He's pretty upset Judy won't sleep in the same bed with Larry. She says it's because of his snoring. I understand all sides, if you care to hear:   Larry  feels that his own wife doesn't love him and won't even sleep in the same bed with him. He feels he can't help his snoring and shouldn't be held responsable. He feels alone and bitter.  Judy  just wants some sleep and thinks it's unfair he says it's not his fault. He's been to the doctor but won't get the surgery to make him stop, thus, he hasn't tried everything.   David  thinks that if their marriage can't withstand snoring, it's no marriage.  On a level I agree with all of them. Maybe it is time to throw in the white flag, though.  David blames himself for our family fighting. It's so easy to blame him, it tore us apart when he announced he wanted to die. I know it's not right to blame him, or anyone for that matter, but I really just want a reason why all of this is happening to me,  to us.    Judy said something to me last night that hit me hard in the gut.  "You know what's funny? Until about last week I thought we were a happy family."    I'm out of pills. the more I sleep the more tired I get, emotionally and physically.    .heart.

       Hands down   this is the worst day I can ever remember.   Stayed up all night, Stuart dozed off around 4ish, I think. Big family fued, the parents finally realized what us children have known all along -- this isn't a "happy" family.  I want to die. Judy keeps talking about divorce and Larry keeps talking about how everyone thinks he is a horrible person. I really just want to die. I'm not happy. I've cried so much today.  Judy says we're just going through a rough patch.  I don't see how she can consider it a "rough patch" when our family is like sandpaper.  ..and Larry just came over and started crying. I took some drugs to knock me out, maybe I'll get some sleep tonight. I hope a truck hits the bus tomorrow and kills me.   "It's kinda like what you said about David and suicide.. I'm just dreaming about divorce.. I don't think I'll actually go through with it.."    .heart.    p.s. TurnUpTheWeez (10:31:23 PM): im actually not stressed at all about boys, just mopey because i know the only one that i like doesn't like me so it's pointless Stuart (10:31:43 PM): =( Stuart (10:31:45 PM): i'm sorry TurnUpTheWeez (10:31:50 PM): it happens.  why are boys always so clueless?

He's done with Katie,  He just needs to get over her. Just like I still need to get over all of the previous boys I've ever looked at.  He's working on a History thing, and I can't sleep so I said I'd keep him company. I can tell he's picking up momentum because he's talking to me less and less. I haven't talked to him late at night in so long, and that's when we  really  talk. I'm more awake at night, and so is he. No distractions, just  us.

       Things never turn out the way you plan them to.   Found Stuart, but he was always dancing with his date ( imagine that ), and I didn't want to be rude. I did give him a hug when the song stopped, though.  Got a little crush on Sarah's boy. I'd never say anything, though, knowing how much she likes him. We went bowling after the dance until 2 a.m., it was pretty rad I guess. Slow danced with my date, Mike D., he has a girlfriend but was still pretty flirty, reminds me of how lonely I am. As long as Judy got the daughter she's always wanted for a night.   When I fall down, I'll fall apart: Trade in my bike for a shopping cart and beg change from a world that needs some, like I need someone.    .heart.

       Lately I've been feeling dead inside Like my guts have dried up and died But every night I water them back to life   Marc didn't like me, He liked what was convenient. I can still taste his mouth, I can still miss his smell. I wish he wasn't my  first kiss.  Is it so hard to find someone that likes you just as much as you like them? Is it so hard to find a serious teenager that means it when he says, "I love you"?    I guess it's part of growing up..   I'm just not sure I'll live through it     .heart.

I'm missing your laugh how did it break? And when did your eyes begin to look fake? I hope you're happy as you're pretending.. I'm cuddiling close To blankets and sheets and I am alone in my defeat ..I wish I knew you were safely at home     Dropped the permission slip off at Mike's house Dropped my heart off at the demilition  reading your note over again and there's not a word that I comprehend except when you sign it   "I love you always and forever.."   .heart.

       "I hope for things to improve with Katie, I do love her."  -Stuart's journal entry  I do hope she comes to her senses and realizes how great Stuart is, but only for  his  sake. In my opinion, she doesn't deserve him.. but I know I don't deserve him, either.   It's so hard to  hide jealousy.    Reading about him falling for  other  girls, while I'm  literally   right under his nose .   "Why don't I say something?"    he loves her .   My heart bleeds for what you never did...    .heart.    p.s. I don't know who to pretend is next to me anymore.

       back in school they never taught us what we needed to know, like how to deal with dispair or someone breakin' your heart...     School was as it always is, useless.   On a lighter note, I saw Stuart today coming down the stairs with his Spanish class as I was going up from retrieving my french book. I was in Study Hall. He slapped my hand and we were smiling, and we kept looking back at eachother.  It made me so happy just to see him smile.   Everynight I pretend he's in bed, laying right next to me, sleeping soundly, and that I'm wrapped up in his arms,  happier than I had ever been before.   Just hold me close to you,    .heart.

       She had eyes bright enough to burn me; They reminded me of yours And in a story told, she was a little girl in a red-rouge, sun-bruised field And there were rows of ripe tomatoes, where a secret was concealed And it rose like thunder Clapped under our hands And it stretched for centuries To a diary entrys end Where I wrote,  "You make me happy, Oh, when skies are gray. You make me happy Oh, when skies are gray, and gray, and gray."    So here we go, again...    Let me fill you in.    Marc  is driving me crazy. He dumped his girlfriend but isn't ready for another relationship but is ready to make out with me and hold me in his arms.  I told him he was driving me crazy because I liked him so much more than he liked me.  "Sorry" was all he said. I guess I should be done with him but I'm probably not. It felt so good not being alone.   David  and I have been hanging out with more. If he really is going to kill himself when he's eighteen like he says he will, I only have a year left with him. I've been saving everything from him, little notes, doodles.. memories. Trying to keep him alive as long as I can. Right now he seems to be head over heels.. well, head over tennis shoes, I guess... in love with a girl named Kel-c. That's how she spells her name, not me. She has been jerking his heart around until he bought her nice $40 roses on Valentine's day. Now she seems to want to see him as soon as possible. Did I mention they've never met eachother before?   Larry  saw the cuts on my arm... er.. wrist... whatever. Every once in awhile he'll get serious and ask me if I'm doing alright. I lie to him and say, "Yeah." and he'll ask me if I'm sure. It's pathetic how many opportunities I get to tell people I need help, that I don't like myself, or where I'm at in my life, and how I just say, "Yeah, I'm living." when I feel truly dead inside. Larry is kind of an odd person, but I think I understand him for the most part. He's fine alone, or with a set amount of people, but he's pretty anti-social. Some people just don't like being around other people, and I can understand why. I am one of the people. He has a horrible temper though, which I don't understand, but I'm working on it. David and him have a lot in common, and I think that's why they clash so much. They are both headstrong and want it their way, and both martyrs.   Stuart  I've been thinking about more and more. I know I'll never stop loving him, he's too great. I'm just waiting patiently until he decides to love me back. He's the only one I can ever talk about my feelings to, and really seems to care.   Dani  is going through some serious shit right now, though. Her little sister ran away, he best friend, which is a girl, is "in love" with her, and her parents are accusing her of doing drugs. I really hope things get better for her, it doesn't seem like they can get any worse.   Mike Donovan  is going to  King of Hearts  with me, a dance at my school. It's my first formal, so Judy is excited and is getting my hair done. My dress is beautiful, and was only $30.00 because it was last season's prom dress. Rad, huh? Which reminds me, I need to walk down to Dierbergs and order a white rose for him to wear. It's this Saturday, and Madi and her date are coming over before the dance to have dinner at my house. I hope it'll be fun, considering I can't dance and Mike has a girlfriend.    Well the clock's heart; it hangs inside its open chest With its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself But I will not weep For those dying days For all the ones who've left There's a few that stayed And they found me here And pulled me from the grass Where I was laid     .heart.

      Kyle M. was singing me Moondance tonight What pretty blue eyes What a good guy  He's as depressed as David That's what I hate They don't help eachother It's like they egg eachother on to be depressed Like influence eachother to be sad And to do drugs  Kyle is a former cutter I don't know how he found out, but he knew I was, too David, Kyle, and I were talking about it He said not to do it because everyone thinks of you differently when you tell them Then he looked directly at me Directly. At. Me. And said, "Right?" I was stunned. I just nodded my head.  I guess it really doesn't matter, because I see his arm and know that he understands me. I know there's no future romance between us Mostly because I don't think he wants it And that's fine I'm really okay with it  I'm really just wondering if Kyle Parrish is having a good time in Florida I wonder if he's on the beach I can't see him getting tan He's so pale, and thin I don't know why I like him so much I guess because I've dreamed up his face so many times Dark, black hair Blue eyes I worked with him awhile ago Before spring break He teased around with me Gosh, I like working with him And I have to say I'm proud of myself for not swearing anymore It's not a good habbit And sometimes it's attractive to be innocent Spencer said something to me that hit me hard "You're you. And that's hot." Hah.. he has no idea.. I guess I could be an actress I don't know why I write such short fragments Maybe so I don't feel so attachted Maybe because it's prettier It looks like a big poem Or song Without a format or cause  There's very few people I can look in the eyes  without feeling awkward Kyle Montaigne Kyle Parrish Marc I don't know why I can look at David's too But I don't do that, anymore He can look at me and lie And it hurts worse if I look him in the eyes while he's lying It literally stings There's a few more people They don't come to mind, however Maybe because I don't know  Kyle M or Kyle P very well to feel awkward If that makes any sense  I've been throwing up more And eating less I haven't cut in awhile But I will soon I feel so neglected But I know not to say anything I see what happened to my parents After David said something And I know they think they're good parents And I don't know what they could've done differently I read an old journal of mine It brings it all back so quickly I had no idea what was coming David hit us so hard with his news And it'd be so great to blame him for everything But I can't Because it's not his fault And I feel the same way Gosh, I wish I was happy Gosh, I wish I had someone ..I wish someone would listen Just listen down the stairs When I weep Just come downstairs Just come   what a horrible poem    .heart.

      Therapy last night. 'Neil', the counselor, is "concerned"  for me .  It's not his job to worry about me. It's his job to worry about David.  We some how always talk about how I mother David.. How I take care of him.. How he thinks I am the only one that care about him.. He asked something last night.. "If Allison is the mother, what does that make Judy?"  Nothing.  She called herself the "provider". Larry is the "provider" David was really bad-mouthing their parenting skills I could relate on some level on others, I wasn't really sure I never really needed a parent Neil said he was concerened that I take care of everyone else's needs That I won't have any needs of my own..?  Wouldn't that be a good thing?  I don't want to have needs..  Fuck, I'm already needy.  David said, "I don't want to get better. I don't want to be happy. I just want to give up and die." Neil said, "God, that must kill you, Allison."  More than anyone will ever know.    Bye bye, Love    .heart.

      Do you, do you like dreaming  Of things so impossible? Or only the practical, Or ever the wild? Waiting through all of your  Bad, bad days; Just to end them  With someone you care about? But do you like making out, And long drives and brown eyes  And guys that just don't quite fit in? Do you like them?   Wishing I was in the moment.. with anyone... anywhere...    .heart.

       He likes to pretend that he's all sewn up, it makes for a  much stronger  case But theres blood underneath that skin   That scar's not so easy to erase    Mallory: " Allie and David don't have that great of a home life.. Family life... But, you don't see them going around telling everyone or slitting their wrists, do you? "   Made me  sick.                                                                            I hadn't realized I told her enough information to gather that.... Although...

       All the girls in every girly magazine can't make me feel any less alone I'm reaching for the phone To call at 7:03 And on your machine I slurr a plea for you to come home But I know it's too late....    Please... Let David be happy... I'll give anything... Cut me open and take my heart.. I don't care if I ever feel again.. Just let David be happy... Please.   ....and I should have given you a reason to stay   .heart.

      Marc came over. He just left, actually. I was showing him out and he stretched his arms out, expecting a hug. It felt good to pretend I didn't see it and for once, to not be left wondering if he was just leading me on. If he really wants me, he can chase me, I think I've finally stopped caring what he thinks about me.  I've been noticing Kyle Parrish more and more lately. God, he is so pretty.... and drug-free, from what I hear.    None of my friends think he looks that great, but... I'm sure there's something about him. It's not in the way he looks so much but in his eyes... I wish he was mine. Everday I tell myself, "Okay, I'll talk to him today... just say 'hi'... no big deal..." but every day at study hall I just stare at my feet and every once in awhile get the guts to look up at him. It's pathetic, really... it's like 2nd grade all over again...  I think we had the right idea when we were younger. Be mean to the boy you have a crush on, and never expose yourself to make yourself vulnerable.. that way no one will hurt... ...no one will  love,   either.   It's so pointless dating now, you just build up distrust for the opposite sex... and by the end, " I love you " has been said so many times it's lost all meaning...  I'm sure don't know what it means.... but who does, really, anymore?  I wish I could cut, but that never solves anything. I really do need to stop.. it's like biting your nails, though...   Whenever I do cut, I hold my breath until the blade has lifted off of my arm.. then a big sigh... and I guess that's what I've been looking for all along.. the relief...  I work at McDonald's. I hate it. So much. I've only worked 2 days. Kyle Parrish works there, too, but I haven't worked with him, yet.  I know I'm being anal and crabby, but really, how do teenagers still not know the difference between their, they're, and there? And punctuation? Some kid just i/med me with "differen't"....  ..if they really do know better, why don't they show it? Is it "cool" to act dumb? I don't get it..   Hm.. is there anything else to mention? No? Okay, I guess I should get going then.   Later Days    .heart.

       But your taste still lingers on my lips like I just placed them upon yours and I   starve   I starve for you...

       You told me that you want to die I said I've been there myself more than a few times I go back every once in awhile You call me lucky.. you call me lucky You said tonight is a wonderful night to die I asked how you could tell You told me to look at the sky  Look at all those stars... look at how goddamn ugly the stars are...   I know I haven't written.. I know you don't care..   The birthday party wasn't much fun. Few people showed up or bother to tell me they couldn't make it.. maybe they just didn't want to make it..?  Adam  did  surprise me Saturday morning by coming in town with  flowers . I really was disappointed when I thought he wasn't going to show for my birthday..  He really is special to me...   Marc came over last Saturday.. The cycle started all over again.. we spent the day wrapped up in each other on David's bed while David's band was recording.. Marc had to get up every once in awhile to play the drums though.. and every time he puts his arm around me or holds my hand I tell myself to remember that feeling because I know I'll miss it later... but once it's later I can't really remember what it feels like and I miss it in a whole nother sense.. I suppose it's hard to explain...   I haven't written in awhile because in my 15-year-old head if I don't talk about something it will disappear. I'm beginning to think David will kill himself when he turns 18 and there's nothing I can do about it.. He does drugs... a lot.. drinks, mostly, I think. I don't like to hear about it and even though I don't have much authority over it I tell him to stop and he listens for about 10 minutes.. I'm not one to tell him to stop, anyhow, because I do some bad stuff, too. It's so hard dealing with this.. I'm so use to being his mother and fixing his problems for him.. I wake him up in the morning.. I make sure he takes his medicine.. I just know how to deal with him... and so it makes me wonder.. does my mom know how to take care of him, too? I don't think she knows how to take care of me.. not that anyone needs to, really.. Therapy was horrible.. I don't want to go back but "Neil", the therapist, wants me to, and if he thinks it will help David I guess I'll endure it... I really have no one to talk about this with that can even remotely relate.... I'm not telling my parents how I've been unhappy for about 2 years... that's for sure... seeing what David has done to them.. wow..  And I don't understand why my generation is so unhappy and everyone needs to be fixed... is it because we get handed everything and there's nothing to take pride in or is it just.. a fad? I'm not sure.. I have never felt so clueless in all my life... usually I'm good at reading people... growing up with David, you have to be... he's a character unlike any other...   I don't want to think about it.  So.. moving on to boys.. life doesn't seem interesting if you don't have anyone to day-dream about all day... And I don't know why I'm stuck on Marc... I honestly don't love him.. I think I might be over Stuart, which is the good news... Not so much over him as he's ignoring me and I gave up..  Kyle Parrish is the prettiest boy I have ever seen in my life. Seriously, I think he's gorgeous and I wish I had the nerve to say hi to him instead of just passing him with a smile.. he's in my seventh hour study hall.. Kyle Montaigne and David say he's a dick, though, but I know they aren't very forgiving when someone makes a mistake so I try to not rely on just their opinion on someone...  I don't know what else to say...  Kyle Montaigne thinks I'm hot, which is really a nice boost of self-esteem that was much needed.... It doesn't help as much as it should, though. I'm getting kind of chubby.. I go through periods where I hardly eat anything for weeks and periods where I eat everything in sight..  ..I don't know.. I just wish all my problems would disappear.. I also wish Marc could sneak in and I could spend the night watching him sleep wrapped up in his arms... how nice that would be.. And I find myself day dreaming.. waking up to his face..  ...why am I stuck on him, again?  just... don't think about it..   Sweet dreams,    .heart.

       I dream of the time When I can make you mine Maybe then I'll feel half alive  Birthday:   Grandma and Grandpa came over, we went out to dinner. Judy bought me a retro phone, it's pretty cute, aqua color. (not a cell phone.. an actual phone..) Larry bought me a MP3 player =) =) =) and Pretty In Pink. Pretty rad.  It turns out I'm having a  birthday party Friday . Judy seemed so disapointed that I wasn't having one, so I said, "why not?" If I invite everyone I want to it'll be 15 kids here, not counting me nor David. So, I'm only inviting 11.. maybe 12...    post-birthday girl,    .heart.    p.s... I have to go with David and everyone to David's therapist tonight.. =/ and I have a job interview at McD's on Friday... and no school on Friday...

Il a mis le café Dans la tasse Il a mis le lait Dans la tasse de café Il a mis le sucre Dans le café au lait Avec la petite cuiller Il a tourné Il a bu le café au lait Et il a reposé la tasse Sans me plarler Il a allumé Une cigarette Il a fait des ronds Avec la fumée Il a mis les cendres Dans le cendrier Sans me parler Sans me regarder Il s'est levé Il a mis Son chapeau sur sa tête Il a mis Son manteau de pluie Parce qu'il pleuvait Et il est parti Sous la pluie Sans me regarder Et moi j'ai pris Ma tête dans ma main Et j'ai pleuré.   -Jacques Prévert   .heart.

       You oughta take your medication everyday, Be a good dog, live your life in a wonderful way.    Started up the Zoloft, again.  Maybe I'll stick to it this time. It's always rocky starting it, but maybe it'll be worth it in a bit.  It seems like everyone thinks a pill will fix everything.   Tomorrow is my birthday. Fifteen years old. I remember when I first started writing in here, I couldn't believe I made it to fourteen. Just when my age starts to feel cozy it has to leave.   I'll never be normal like you    .heart.

      you're not  suppose  to make the  same mistake   twice  but I  will.   I always do.   David went over to Kristen's house.  Dad returned and acted like a hero for getting David out of this house.  I've always been there for him But I'm a back-up If  some  girl isn't there he'll just turn to me  and he's ditched me so many times he went to her instead of me tonight i think i'm done god, i hope so god, please  he has no idea how much he hurt me tonight no idea.   so kill me quick    .heart.

       No, I haven't abandoned you.   Here's an easier way to explain what has been going on recently:  TurnUpTheWeez: so David went to therapy tonight and I didn't go but when my mom and him got home I asked how it went and she was like "horrible" and I said why and she said David cussed her out, said "fuck you" gave her the finger and totally freaked out the therapist just kinda scolded him and was surprised and they talked about how David was an ass to me and he's like "so not even my little sister loves me what's the fucking point to live? you can't give me a fucking reason to live" so Neil (therapist) said that if David pulls anything tonight or tomorrow take him to a mental hospital or a foster home place and he wont live here anymore and so really it's up to David if he's going to move out or not he thinks he's going to though and he says he's going to drop out of school and well basically never see me again so. yeah. my mom asked me why I'm not miserable like him, why I turned out so different and honestly I feel as sad as him but its because of him and its not like I'm gonna tell my mom she has two kids to worry about  TurnUpTheWeez: oh, and get this, when my dad comes home he asks if Kristen Trecker can come over. my dads like "I don't think so, David" and he freaks out and goes WHY NOT? is he REALLY that dumb that he cant figure out that cussing out your mom has its consequences?  mallory: okay, David is really getting on my nerves  TurnUpTheWeez: your nerves?!  mallory: he is probably the most selfish person from what you say  TurnUpTheWeez: he lies so much, he told me so long ago that he quit smoking and everything  mallory: do you want him to go? would you really be upset?  TurnUpTheWeez: I really don't know if things would be better off without him here  TurnUpTheWeez: god I would miss him  TurnUpTheWeez: I'd be so lonely  TurnUpTheWeez: maybe it's really what I need though  TurnUpTheWeez: I really need to stop being a naive little sister and always forgiving him and looking out for him   TurnUpTheWeez: but I really know I wont because I'm a tool  mallory: I think it'd be SO much better for you, for your family, for everything if he did, you wouldn't have to accommodate your life to him, you wouldn't have to worry about him, and he wouldn't be lying to you, your family might be happier without him yelling at everyone about how no one cares about him and how fuckin stupid everyone is  TurnUpTheWeez: I would still worry about him  TurnUpTheWeez: probably twice as much  TurnUpTheWeez: and I really don't like the idea of it just being me and my parents  mallory: I just cant believe someone like him, who wouldn't have it that bad, is that sick minded  TurnUpTheWeez: I'm use to being ignored  TurnUpTheWeez: yeah  TurnUpTheWeez: I know  TurnUpTheWeez: he really is mentally ill  TurnUpTheWeez: I think he's skipping school tomorrow and if he is he's probably going to a foster home  mallory: like I'm so ready to just be like "David SHUT UP." when he's like "life sucks everyone's gay I hate them" but of course everyone would be like "mallory he's been through a lot why would you say that, you don't know how he feels"  mallory: STUPID EEEEEDIOTS  TurnUpTheWeez: I really am beginning to think that he's not depressed at all and just wants to wrap everyone around his finger so he can control everyone  TurnUpTheWeez: he's so sick  TurnUpTheWeez: so, so sick  mallory: its amazing someone can be like that. Just amazing.  TurnUpTheWeez: its funny, when I was younger I wanted to be a therapist  TurnUpTheWeez: I don't think I ever will consider that   TurnUpTheWeez: again  TurnUpTheWeez: god, I'm so torn, this is pathetic, I cant believe this but I know I  will miss him so much and I don't want him to go  TurnUpTheWeez: it's like I know it will be better in the long run but god  TurnUpTheWeez: he's my fucking brother  TurnUpTheWeez: he's never not been around  mallory: yea I know, no matter what he's still family  TurnUpTheWeez: I'm scared  mallory: I just cant believe what you have to deal with  TurnUpTheWeez: I think I'm giving myself a fever, hah.  mallory: like I want to punch caitlin tucker in the face when she says she has it rough  TurnUpTheWeez: it's better no one really knows about me, honestly, you and stuart are  the only ones that know me like this  TurnUpTheWeez: I feel so pathetic like this  mallory: you're so, like personal its just so different from most people, especially girls, girls love sympathy and you shake all this off and live it.  mallory: I admire you lol  TurnUpTheWeez: thank you a lot mallory really that means a lot to me   well maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old..   well I don't know I don't know        I don't know   I hope so.    .heart.

      this house is full of eyes, but i can't look at anyone; they've seen this face a thousand times. most relaxing thing i do, hang half way out a third floor window, and look at rocks..  if i fall out, well, maybe i'll fall hard.  something tough to break me, something sharp to rip into my insides and bleed out all that pain.  sorry i don't even know your name.  i guess for me it's easy this way.     Isolating myself in the basement.     What else is there to say?   I need to go puke up the parts that hurt    .heart.

      I want a lover I don't have to love I want a girl whose too sad to give a fuck   I feel bad. So lonely. Kyle Parrish has a girlfriend. But it's not really that.. it's that I can never seem to find anyone anywhere that is interested in me  I'm so sick of feeling like this I'm so sick of my life  It makes me sick because I'm starting to realize I accidentally repeat what David says... His views on life.. I don't want to feel like David I know I do, way down deep, but I would never admit it to anyone ..Besides Stuart  ..Which makes me think.. If he knows I hate my life.. But never really makes an effort to cheer me up... does he really care about me at all..? I'm too blind to see that no one really cares about me.  Judy doesn't listen to me, and she proves that with her actions. I know she tries her best, but really, all she has to do is pay attention to what I'm saying sometimes. Larry tries to talk to me but it's too late for that. We never had a relationship to build off of, all he did when we were little was scaring us into what he wanted us to do. How can we trust him and how can he expect me to open up to him? Judy and him were talking about it a long while ago while we were growing up She was saying that David and I were going to grow up resenting him for the way he was treating us He said he doesn't care, and that we would respect him no matter what it took He really does scare me I've had nightmares of him beating us.. and of Judy just sitting there, watching him, filing her nails.  Everyone seems to keep asking me, "what's wrong?" I'd tell them if I thought they could help. I hate being a teenager. You want someone when you don't have them and when you have someone you don't want them. I think Hell for me would be being stuck this age forever.  I really hate myself. I need to stop eating. Stop cutting.  A lot of people in my school do it and people that don't do it.. they just think cutters want attention and it feels like my sleeves are see-through and everyone can look at my scars and I've told way too many people..  People who know.. Kyle M. David Meg Stephanie Christian Stuart Eric Niah Dani Madi Ira  and who knows how many shitty people they've told. The only people that I told was Christian, Madi, Stuart, Niah and Dani. The rest I was exposed to. I'm sure other people know. They just haven't said anything.  I need to go puke. Or cut. Or anything to relieve myself of this intense loneliness. David wouldn't help now.. I want someone outside this family to pretend to care for once I really want romance.   Lie to me and say, "Everything will be alright."    .heart.

They picked me up an hour late from work, and Skyler never called me to do anything. She's flaky like that.  Stayed home today. Larry came in and asked how I felt. I said I felt like crap. He said I should stay home today after feeling my head. I know I was actually worse the last couple of days but I'm not going to pass up an opportunity to sleep in. Skyler's home, too, because of a sore throat. Her mother's a nurse and is pretty over protective. Judy would never let me stay home because of a sore throat.  I love working with Kyle Parrish. And I love sitting across from him in study hall because he'll wave "Hi" to me and we'll mouth a couple words to each other. He grins a lot and I love his smile.  I like Ian, too. I'm not sure why people don't think very highly of them. I can understand why they might call Ian mean, but I think he's more honest than anything. And for Kyle, I just think they can't take a joke. They both tease me a lot. I love being David's little sister because in a way all of his friends are like big brothers to me, also. Eric once even introduced me as his little sister.   I bought two rings for Sarah at the Delmar Loop over spring break. She liked them a lot. They were worth the money. They were about $27 together.  It's funny how I'll read what Marc has to say online and such and realize he isn't very mature or smart. Just his sentence structure and language and reason. How could I ever be attracted to someone like that? I'm still jealous of other girls calling him hot, though. If he asked me out tomorrow I probably would because I'm so weak. Right now we're friends, and I have to admit I like it that way. We're cracking jokes to each other online and it's just.. fun.  I'd rather be with Kyle Parrish anyway.  I think I'm finally over Stuart... Maybe..  No, I'm not really sure. We talked on the phone a few days ago for about an hour; it was so nice to have a real conversation with someone my age. I love how smart he is and how, if anything, I learn something from him. Whenever I would talk to Marc he'd always ask what "subtle" meant or "gloat". With Stuart.. I don't know.. I just feel like I can be myself.. and he makes me laugh.  Nope, I can't like him again. I better move on to another topic, or just leave to upstairs all together. Yeah, I think I'll go take a shower.   She's perfect in that fucked up way That all the magazines seem to want to glorify these day    .heart.

       Work from Five to Eight   Darn  I feel  horrible.  Sinus infection. I feel like I'm going to crack a rib coughing so hard. Skyler invited me to spend the night Saturday night, she said she could only invite one person and I was the one. Gosh, I hope I don't have to work. I also hope that when Field Hockey starts up I can quit my job because I would much rather play a sport. No way am I giving up Field Hockey when I got voted MVP last year and just when we're getting good And how easy and natural it comes to me..? It's the only thing people think I'm good at. I don't really think I'm good at it, I just think it's easy.  This spring break sucks. I can't believe I'm sick.  Well, hopefully I'll develop a fever, which will allow me to miss work. I'm only working three hours though, I really should try my best to go But, gosh, I don't even have a desire for cash Sheesh I guess I need to find something I want So I can have a goal to work towards Or maybe if my grades drop I can blame it on work When really I just can't stop thinking about David And there's so much going on in my 15 year old head It's hard to memorize the quadratic formula Or dates in history I'm doing it again Pressing "enter" after every phrase I don't know why I don't think I care, either I read two books yesterday "Cut" and "Go Ask Alice" I think I like "Cut" better I can relate to it But now I have nothing to do Because I finished "Swear to Howdy" And there's nothing else to read   Would you like fries with that?    .heart.

       ...Kyle and I were an item. I loosely took his hand and he gripped it tightly and led me somewhere. Then it faded to me lying beside him and I put my arms around his neck and just held him there for awhile. Then I woke up and remembered what he said when we were playing video games together. "If I had a girlfriend I wouldn't even want her to have sex with me or force her to do anything, I would just want to hold her hand and have someone there I could love and tell everything to." If only boys were really like that. I think tomorrow I will hold his hand, though. :)    Madi had spent the night.. it was nice not to have to go to work today. We didn't do much last night, we went to Shrek 2; the movie. We met Corey there and Judy joined us. Corey was looking good -- really good. He got his hair cut and really grew up. Now his personality just needs to grow up. I could tell he was more interested in Madi though -- everyone always is. She's so sweet.  I've been talking to Dustin a lot lately. It's driving me crazy not knowing who he is. He has apparently seen me in the halls and all that but never says hi. Ech, boys are stupid.  Marc is going out with his ex girlfriend. Figures. He's already cheated on her, though. She doesn't know it. She must not have any respect for herself if she allows herself to be strung along by Marc. He's still a good fellow to joke around with and get hugs from. Not kisses, though.  I've been getting very irrated lately with my family. Been around them too much, I guess. Either way I wish they would just leave me alone. They always come at the worst moments and ugh.. just give me my space. This heat isn't helping my mood much, either. No a/c in this house, it broke. Augh. Kill me.  I really want to be with someone right now. I really do need to stop listening to this sappy music and get over myself. So I'm not that pretty, or talented, or outgoing. I need to get over it.    ro MAN tic funny how 'man' is built right into the word.       .heart.

      The concert was a good time. I'm confident Chris was singing every song to me.. haha, right.   Last night I came home from work. Nate, Kyle M., David and two girls were over. I went into his room, two girls in his bed under the blankets with Nate and David. Kyle was on the floor. I asked him what's wrong, he got up and asked if he could talk to me and announced that I'm nice to talk to. I lead him downstairs and turned on the super nintendo, and gave him first player because he had a bad day. He was talking about how he invited those girls over as his friends and how everyone was ignoring him. How he just wanted to jump out of the car and end it. He asked me if I've ever felt like that.. I avoided the question. I don't know why I avoid talking about myself. I guess because I don't know really how to talk about myself too well. He was drunk, too, but I scooted closer to him while he talked about how life sucked. I really wanted to hug him, just put his head in my lap and make everything better, but I knew that would just be leading him on. Kyle and I could never be together, we're so different, and I had to think about the consequences of my actions. Kyle said something that hit me hard. 'You know, if they cared about me they'd be coming downstairs and asking me what's wrong.' I couldn't do anything but agree with him on that, and that's happened to me a number of times. After awhile Kyle told me to come upstairs with him. I asked why, and he just demanded that I come. We went upstairs into David's room and I immediatly got kicked-out. While David was lecturing me on how I can't just walk in, Kyle was trying to interrupt him and tell him that he told me to come. I didn't drag Kyle into it, but shortly after I left Kyle went home. He was walking home and I stepped out on the front porch and stopped him. I walked with him to the edge of the street and we talked a bit. He was really drunk, but very honest. I was angry with David and those girls and Nate. Kyle was telling me how he felt so ignored and how he walked in and the girl had her hands down Nate's pants. He just felt so lonely and I totally agree with him on that. They stayed late, fooling around on the couch. I turned my music up loud to drain out my thoughts and went to sleep.   Dustin: my supposed girlfriend i dont even really think is my girlfriend nymore so jst kinad having a bitchy time with alota stuff now lol Me: why isn't she your girlfriend anymore?:-Dustin: well shes asian, so i dunno i always thought her parents may have issues with me being white and i hardly even talk to her nymore and i swear she doesnt try avoiding me intentiaally but she does and she dropped some stuff in my lcoker for me in my locker and all for my bday but didnt even tell me happy birthday till i happened to see her outside at the end of the day no call, no nothing  but its friggen reasons like that , that ir ealy hate getting close to people   .heart.

      Well, Tuesday night started off simple enough. David and I were going to a concert and were preparing to ask permission. As I started in, Judy asked where we were going and what time and all of the expected parent questions. David cuts her off, beginning to say, 'I'm seventeen, why do I even have to ask permission? This is so stupid.' I tried to cut him off -- somehow David doesn't understand that it's courteous to ask permission if you want to go. Luckily I did cut him off in time and they said we were allowed to attend with Miranda. I felt like it was safe to go downstairs for a bit as long as David kept his mouth closed, considering Miranda wasn't going to pick us up for another hour or so. I'm downstairs not but five minutes and I hear yelling. I pray it's just in my head, but it's not. I go upstairs and Larry is furious. I ask them what David did, Larry explains that when he went in to let David know why they needed all this information about his whereabouts incase something happened to us. Apparently David rolled his eyes and it pissed Larry off. "Get up you piece of shit." And I watch as Judy follows Larry in to yell at David together. Then Larry decides he will call Miranda and let her know personally that David can not go. "Hi, this is Larry Brandon, David's father. I'm fine, thanks. I wanted to let you know David won't be attending tonight because he's an asshole. He can't even say thank you to his grandfather when he comes over and you know, his aunt gave him money for his birthday and he was rude to her. So basically, he's an asshole..." He carried on, spilling personal information, trying to embarrass David while insulting him repeatedly. Then I hear Larry yell, "WELL, I DON'T CARE!" and slam down the phone. Apparently Miranda said, "I don't think this is appropriate for you to be telling me." Which was very, very true. Larry goes into the hall and throws a fit, jumping up and down and slamming his fists into his knees. His face was red and he was huffing while heading to David's room to yell at him some more. I sank back against the hall closet and curled up, quivering from fear. I was so scared. When Larry turned around he could see how scared I was and started crying, really crying like a toddler in a grocery store that doesn't get his way. He hugged me and apologized, and I was too scared to cry -- I was just making a high pitched whimper noise I really couldn't control. I felt like I was going to pass out. Larry left and I walked into the kitchen, shaking all over while Judy watched t.v. and ignored me. That's what probably hurts the most, when I'm obviously shaken up she doesn't make any attempt to comfort me like a mother should. She doesn't act like she cares for me at all. I was so upset, and even more upset that no one even cared that I was upset I said I was going for a walk inbetween tears. Judy pointed out that it was raining, and I let her know I didn't care. I just needed to get away. I walked out of the house and got out of the neighborhood as fast as I could, trying to hide my face from the nosey neighbors. Finally, on the road I started running so people wouldn't notice me so much. Running through all of the bushes, getting wet and smelly and sad. I made a plan to run to my highschool, over three miles away, and there I would get help. I knew that there was an afterschool talent show that night and that Mallory would be there. I just kept running, taking breaks, and then running again. Along the way I saw a sister of a friend-of-a-friend. I knew her, mostly because she's made a point of it to come up to me and say David is "hot". She was with her friend, Sabrina. Honestly, they looked like two witches, one peddiling on the bike and the other riding. I'm not sure why, but it seemed really important to mention that. They both had all black with pale, white faces. I guess it scared me even more. I can't believe I made it to the highschool. When I found Mallory I waved for her to come outside in the lobby and talk with me. She mouthed, "What's wrong?" and I shook my hand even harder. I told her everything, I spilled my guts. Half I'm sure she didn't even understand through all the tears and hiccups, but she still understood. We stopped Kyle K., a guy in my english class, and used his cell phone. They both listened while I called my house. Judy asked where I was, and said, "Let me come and get you." I said, "No." I didn't mean to be harsh. Thinking on it now, I should've gone, but Mallory already offered to let me spend the night. My mom started crying, "Why not?" "Because, I want to talk with Mallory for awhile. Mom, please just let me spend the night at Mallorys. Please." Larry got on the phone, crying loud and hard, and that scared me, too. "Allie, I'm so sorry, I just feel like this is all my fault, I'm so sorry." Then Judy, "Okay, you can spend the night at Mallory's. I love you. Good bye." I felt so shitty and so, so guilty. Apparently Judy was out with her car looking for me because there were tornado warnings. Honestly, it's about time I've gotten some worry from them. While I was walking to the highschool I was thinking how great it was going to be if I could make them miss me, not knowing it's just going to fuck me up inside with all of the guilt. I am such a sick person. All I wanted was some attention after being ignored for about three years because they already had one kid to worry about, they didn't need me. I wasn't their kid, just someone that lived in their house and took care of myself. So, I spent the night at Mallory's, practically crying myself to sleep and pretending it wasn't awkward around her brother and her mom. David brought my bookbag and purse to school the next day. This should have been a sweet gesture, but it was obvious David didn't care where I went last night or what I did. He only brought the stuff because Judy told him to. When I came home yesterday, Judy came downstairs. I didn't want to look at her, I was afraid I was going to cry. I just wanted her to say she cared about me and was glad I am okay and that she'll try harder and so will Larry and so will David. I just wanted her to be a mom and hug me and give me a band-aid that would fix everything. It didn't happen that way. Judy asked if Miranda was giving me a ride to the concert that night, which was a Dashboard concert I'd been planning on seeing for months. I said yeah. She said to call Miranda, and that Larry would give me a ride -- she doesn't want Miranda in our house. I said that that is stupid, she didn't so anything, and Larry shouldn't have said those things to her. "Kids shouldn't talk to adults that way." "ADULTS SHOULDN'T TALK TO KIDS THAT WAY!" The screaming match continued upstairs. I said I wanted to leave this house and how I've tried talking to her before but it's not like I could, she just mocked me. She made excuses for everything and I didn't hear, "I'm sorry" once. She blamed everything on David. "He single handedly tore up this family. I hate him even more now because he's making me lose my daughter. After school's out he's gone, 7 more days! I don't know why you're so faithful to him after the way he treats you!" "He's my brother, and your son, and you love him no matter what you say and you always will. You blame everything on him. I can't believe you're giving up." "What else am I suppose to do? Get him more counsiling? He refuses! He won't take his medicine and all he does is fight with us! Are we suppose to just take his abuse." "What you do when he disrespects you and you get so angry that you slam your fists in to your knees and you act like you're about to hit him you shut his door and go outside and cool down. Parents don't act like that! Parents need to be parents and be the bigger people! You need to control yourself! There is no excuse for the way you guys acted. None." "I wish Dad would have taken his fist and beat David to a bloody pulp. That's what he needs!" "I come home and you don't even act like you missed me or cared about me. If he's leaving, I'm leaving." "Good, I can't wait." "I love you, too!" Everything you can imagine was said and it continued until Larry came home. I was standing, crying into my palms, and he asked in a sympathetic tone, "What's wrong, Al?" Judy explained in her own words. By "her own words" I mean that she got everything I said totally upside-down. We go in and actually talk about it, and I say how when Larry is angry Judy just follows him in to David's room and it looks like two bullies egging eachother on. And how it was inappropraite for Larry to call Miranda, and how I have been completly ignored. How I haven't told them anything deep and serious about me since I've become a teenager, in five years. How I've tried my hardest not to be noticed so they can concentrate on David and even try to help so it takes some strain off of them. And if they kick out their son, he is partly my son, too, because I did help raise him. I said I have kept my mouth shut for the longest time about any problem I've had and how I'm not allowed to be a teenager and get in to trouble and just have fun because how screwed up my family is. And how I have to go to school everyday and pretend everything is normal when it's not. Judy said that she was listening now and wanted me to tell her my problems. Larry explained it to her, "You act like it's a switch that can be turned on and off." How am I suppose to trust them? I don't know how to talk to people, especially them. I told her I didn't know how to tell her, I wasn't use to it. Judy said that she thought I was good at knowing how people felt. Very true, I'm good at understanding people's feelings, but not my own. I can talk about anyone else but myself. I don't think Judy will ever know much about me, she's not persistant nor patient enough. So, then, I call my friend Tj about the concert. He cancels on me, can't go. I ask my parents if David can go in place. They don't like the idea of rewarding David when he was rude to them last night. I asked them if for once they could make it about me, if they were really getting rid of my brother in seven days then I would like to spend some time with him. "You'll spend time with him later, he won't be gone but a couple of months." "And you think it will ever be the same?" He got to go, but they made sure he knew it was for me, not for him. They hate being nice to him. I'm exhausted, and I have an english project due tomorrow. I'll have to wake up early for it. I also have to work tomorrow.    "Haaay.. tell your dad to call me tonight.. I miss him.. haha."    .heart.

      David's birthday yesterday. Kyle M. came over along with Nate. Later on, Miranda and Anna showed up. They're "different" from what Judy says.. I don't really notice if anyone is "different" anymore. I remember when I was younger I'd be afraid or curious about people who would dress or act differently. I don't even know it anymore, everyone is their own person -- everyone is "different".  Kyle played some bass for me. It was amazing -- considering it was David's left-handed bass and "upside-down" to him. He played some cute songs that I would recognize and sang softly so no one else would hear. I tried to avoid eye contact because whenever I did he would start smiling and.. I just felt like I was leading him on by accident. I'm not sure.. it just didn't feel right.. so I just grinned and watched his fingers. I think it was more that when I looked up he was looking right at me, into my eyes.. I'm just not use to people being that interested or close. When we all sneaked out to go get taco bell, he started smoking a cigarette. He asked if I approved, I said no. He asked why. "Because I care about you and I don't like you hurting yourself." "But I like to hurt myself." "Don't, it's not a good thing." "See, that's sweet." Why can't David think I'm sweet when I say those things? I would definatly persue Kyle if I knew it would work -- but I know it wouldn't. I would try to change him. He's been clean for twenty days now, and I believe him. He doesn't lie about that stuff like David does.   Marc. Augghh. Marc. I know this isn't anything but he just hugged me and put his arm around me. It's nothing, really. He was just feeling lonely because everyone else was hooking up. And when he kissed the air a couple inches from my forehead and said goodnight? I don't know why I can't get over him. Seeing him, he really does act like an adolescent. And he really isn't that attractive.   I wish Nate would like a girl like me. So unlikely and obviously not going to happen. Darn. It's for the best, seeing how he does smoke and is probably just as bad as Kyle with a better cover.  I've been talking to Dustin a lot more, now. It's kinda stupid that I probably haven't realized I've seen him at school. He said he's seen me a couple of times but never said hi because I looked busy. He always seems to compliment me online, however. He's heavy into martial arts, which is cool. Everyone should persue what they're interested in.. I just don't know what I'm interested in. I've told him a lot about my family because he's been through a lot, also. He's very mature which in a way scares me.. Maybe that's why I like Marc. I know I'm ahead of him, and I can understand his way of thinking. With Dustin I'm never sure what he'll say and... it reminds me of Stuart.. which I'd perfer not to have heartache over ever again. I'm not sure if I've mentioned this but I have told him I have a blog. He really seemed interested and instead of really convincing him it wasn't a good idea to check it out I just changed the subject. Maybe once I meet him. Maybe later. I can never be as open if I know someone I care about is reading this, wether it be a crush, friend, family.  Kyle P. finally got caught for skipping with Ian. They're neighbors and skip very often. Ten days of out of school suspension. I kinda miss staring at him. Hah. His one year anniversary with his girlfriend was a little while ago. From what I hear, he doesn't treat her very well. It's a shame, really.  I hate when I my head hits the pillows I have the deepest thoughts and everything from that day makes sense. I really want to write it all down so I remember it and can think on it later, but my body is dead. Really, I can't move.  I'm home alone right now. David went to Kyle's -- I'm not sure if his parents are home or not. I think I've given up. It's a really sad, pathetic, low feeling because David has been more of a son to me than a brother.   But, fuck, I'm fifteen. I need to live my own life, or try to.   I'm staring at the asphalt wondering-- What's buried underneath.    .heart.

       Allie - i love you so much, nothing will ever change that. youre the most understanding person who has always been there for me. im always here for you too. you can come live with me anyday, you might get the occasional wake up in the middle of the night ;-) but id be happy to keep you here! because i love you, and without you, life would be so boring, and i really know what type of person is great all around when i look at you. you have never done anything to hurt someone. you constantly help people. no matter what youre always forgiving. i wish i was like you    [Mallory's profile]  I am thankful for that, but in a way I wish she wouldn't think that highly of me. It makes me feel like I have to be strong when all I really want to do is cry. Eh. Oh well.  So, we sat down and talked. I couldn't believe it. I really didn't think my parents were capable of being rational. David and Judy were the ones freaking out. David was crying and carrying on and saying how he was going to be grounded for his seventeenth birthday and that it was all my fault. He blamed the entire ordeal on me. I understand that I reassured him that it would be okay, but that isn't the same thing as forcing him to do it. Oh, and the school called because his english teacher says David told her he did drugs and is disruptive. That isn't true, David isn't proud he does drugs except when he feels like bragging to all the other potheads. I think so low of him now, I don't think we'll ever be as close as we were. I can't believe how he fucks things up like that. I'm to the point where I'm numb towards him and I don't care much about waking him up for school or making sure he takes his medicine. I'm sick of being a mom to a child I never wanted. I just want to be a fucking kid for once and have fun.   I was crying downstairs once they sent me down because they needed to talk to David about his english class. I was just crying thinking of everything, of how I missed Judy while she was away and now that she's back she's mad at me. She came down and I told her how grandma had forgotten about me and how I missed them. She asked why I didn't call.. I told her the truth. "You guys just got away from us, do you really think you would want to hear from me? You just got away..."  Later Larry came downstairs. He sat me down and talked to me. He said that David feels like I never get punished. This is something he's been saying his whole life... somehow he thinks life favors me, in general, and I just have it so much better than him. So what Larry basically was saying was that he was going to punish although I don't deserve it. He's punishing me to make David feel better and to meet David's wants.   I personally do not think one child's happiness should be sacrificed for anothers. I tried to explain it to Stuart.. He agrees more with Larry. It kills me.  I cried all night. Only Larry noticed my extreme depression. Slowly walking up the stairs, plopping on the couch and curling into a ball, silently crying. No one really seemed to care. I went downstairs and cried myself to sleep.  This morning I found out David has been telling all my friends that I told the people at work to call him in, too. That I had set up the whole thing and that it was all my fault. That I forced him to do it. What a fucking liar. I'm so ashamed to have a brother like him. He's embarrassing and I wish he would grow up and stop being such an asshole. He use to be so smart, why did he fuck all that up with drugs?  I use to love him so much. I don't think I can hardly tolerate him anymore. I feel so numb towards him. If he doesn't want to get better, he won't. If he doesn't want to stop smoking, he won't. If he doesn't want to care about me.. he doesn't.   My feet are still so heavy.    .heart.    p.s. I guess I'm not as forgiving as Mallory thinks I am.

        we got caught.   ha.   why us? ALWAYS.   David blames everything on me. He ignores the fact that he could back out, I didn't force him to do anything. I really hope things do turn out okay considering all I was going to skip was seventh hour STUDY HALL. I wonder how they knew it was a fake call..? I really hope I didn't ruin Judy and Larry's vacation for them. They'll be pissed, yell, scream... All those terrible things. The resonable thing to do would be to sit us down and ask us what's wrong with us that we keep doing bad things. They won't though, they aren't good at staying calm with bad things. On the way home from school I was just leaning my head against Casey's car window just hoping with all the rain and thunder we would skid into a tree and our parents would realize that we do mean something to them other than money and stress. It didn't happen, but God I wish it would've. I can't get out of this, I feel so trapped. I have tried to explain how unhappy I am here to Judy.. she is so, so cruel.   The really sad thing is, I bet if I live with my grandparents.. wether it be in a different school.. I'd probably be so much more happier. And make better grades, too.  I hope they still let me go to the Dashboard Confessional concert in eight days. We'll see. I hope more that they still let David celebrate his birthday.   We need someone to look over us, to really settle my parents down.   David was yelling at me in the car ride home...  Does he not realize I constantly feel terrible, if he yells at me or not? I've been a fucking idiot. David smoked pot on Saturday. I feel like such a fool for trusting him. He's not going to stop.... he always makes me seem like a fool. It's like a game to him. He knows I will always trust him... he'll never stop... I need to get away from this... away from life.  The really sad thing is, my parents don't realize they could have worse kids doing worse things. My friend thinks she might be pregnant.. a month and a half without a period. I'd say so. My parents just don't get it.. all I've ever done is kiss one boy. Even if more guys were interested in me, all I ever would've done was kiss them.  I really like Nate. I know he's not interested in me, but it's one of those things where I notice everything he does. He looked at me a couple of times in the car ride home when we dropped Marc off at taco bell. Everyone was blaring Weezer and singing along and I caught him glancing at me a few times.. Those are the best times, no joke, just blaring your favorite band and acting like an obnoxious kid just singing along and air-guitaring and just hanging out with your best friends. I wish everyone could just live like that and be happy and just.. don't sweat the small things.   she looks like she could've been happy in a better life    .heart.

         Well, to start off with, some GOOD news... I got an e-mail from a Miss Joanna. It turns out someone  has  been reading. But the link she gave me for her blog isn't working too well which just leaves me curious about her. Darn. But that's pretty rad, I guess, that she e-mailed me. Afterall, Dani and I met through a diary website and I think she's part of the reason I could stop cutting and move on. I think that's finally behind me now. All I have are these awful scars to remind me of how weak I was. Ech. Dani isn't too good anymore and I don't talk to her much, now. She got into drugs and that's what she seems wrapped up in. It's a shame, too. I guess we stopped talking once we realized we only came to eachother for problems... and you start avoiding someone when all they have is problems. I'm glad I'll never turn to drugs, seeing David, Kyle, and Dani. It really makes me sad for them.... But, yeah, with what I started out saying, I'll have to e-mail her back. At first I thought it was more spam until I saw my name and was a little anxious. I'm in a goofy mood today. Dustin is a guy (well, duh) that I've been talking to online for the longest time. It's a friend-of-a-friend type dealie, and he always says he sees me at school but never wants to bug me by saying hi. He's very nice though and I enjoy talking to him. He asked to see my blog, but honestly I'm more comfortable with strangers seeing this than I am with him. Mostly because I'm not close to strangers -- who cares what they think? And because if I do something pretty bad I can be honest about it and don't have to worry about it spreading around my horrible highschool.    I really like my red fingernails. And hair.  This sounds silly, but I miss something that I can't put my finger on. I've had this feeling for the longest time. It's like I'm missing something that isn't really there, or ever was. I just feel empty, I guess. I miss my parents, a lot. I'm not sure if I miss my parents or if I miss the absence of my grandma. Pathetic, huh? I'm afraid I haven't been very nice to her -- making up excuses not to eat with her. People really don't understand me, though. They don't understand how I perfer to be alone and they really shouldn't take offense. I guess I really do need people, sometimes, though. So I don't cut and all.. The person I always went to was Stuart. He seemed to always leave me hanging, though. Always have to break away before I felt better. It's suppose to help to talk about your problems but.. not if you don't get feedback.  Everything's set for tomorrow. I'm so stupid, happy and numb. I can't wait.  I have to remind myself not to go out with Tony. He's the type of guy to sweet talk you and fall for your friends. He seems so innocent, but I've known him since seventh grade, I really should learn from my mistakes.  Okay, I don't mind the french language, but french class is getting difficult to tolerate. Somehow, the most annoying booger (yes, I'm allowed to act my age every once in awhile) is  always  the victim. My teacher is an idiot. At least in french-3 next year there will be a different teacher.  It really bothers me how David emphasizes how much better he is at everything than I am. I am in french level 2 while he is in 1 but he still tries to correct my french. Grr... I guess it's the role of the big brother, though. I hate working with him because he always says I'm doing something the wrong way. "No, I will not have  my  little sister being stupid." It really makes me feel shitty. It's amazing how he seems to be 'depressed' but thinks he's better than everyone..? He's so manipultive, it scares me.  Steph is coming over in a bit and we're going over to Marc's to hear the band. David let me know that I have had a crush on every band member that has ever played with them. That's true, with the exception of David of course. They have a new singer, Nate Hackman. All the girls are always after Nate, he's such a nice, genuine guy. I'm not 'after' him like everyone else, but if he was interested I would definatly not turn him down. David knows I like him because I blushed when he asked me about it. I never use to blush but I do it ten times a day now. At lunch it's become an olympic sport -- all my friends try to get me to blush. Mostly what does it is when Stuart gives me his chocolate milk.... I really like chocolate milk..  oh, gosh, I think I'm blushing now..   "Look! Allie's blushing!"    .heart.

       urlLink    'emo' allie.  That picture isn't very recent.. about the same time as the one bellow. Larry and Judy are gone right now, with the digital camera, so I can't post my red hair up here.   I was thinking David and I had to catch the bus this morning but I forgot that my neighbor Casey is driving us now. Since the seniors left they let sophomores have junior parking space and juniors move up to senior spaces.  So, she's driving us. I wish David could drive.  I'm pretty tired since I forgot I had to get up this early. I might go back to bed or something, we'll see.  I guess that's it..?    here goes nothin'    .heart.

      Dyed my hair tonight. Well, streaked it... highlighted it.. whatever. It's a reddish color, I like it o.k. I think I'll do more of it. I think I'm also streaking it black. I'm not sure. I'll get pictures up a.s.a.p. I also have a less recent one of me looking pretty emo if I do say so myself. I should put that up as well.  Kyle M. called tonight, he's drunk. David was telling me what he was saying. He wanted me to know he thought I had a nice voice. David said, "She says, 'me?!'" and I could hear Kyle on the other end, "Yeah, you!" and David replies, "She laughed that cute laugh that just makes you want to kiss her." "Yeah.. I know." It'd mean so much more if Kyle wasn't drunk when he was romancing me. It'd mean  something.   I missed Judy today. I couldn't get a ride home from work and I missed her because I thought if she was here she would make it all better and come and get me. That's not true because she has forgotten about me, too. I guess my six year old came out and surfaced because I just wanted to cry and be held when I was stuck and work for an hour being embarrassed because my grandma forgot to pick me up. I was going to call Judy once I got home and tell her what had happened but I thought she really wouldn't care to listen..  David and I are having Stephanie from work call us out 7th hour on tuesday. A bunch of people from work are skipping 7th hour and going to Steak 'n Shake to hang out. It'll be fun. David's worried, but I'm not. We won't get caught, Judy and Larry won't be back until about 5 or so, Tuesday night, and we'll be home way before then. And if not, we'll just call and say we got picked up from school and was just hanging out.. or went home on the bus with someone. No biggie. Plus it gives me something to look forward to,  finally .  I don't know what else to say. David came home and I think something happened at Chrissy's because he, "wants to be alone." David has been very cruel towards me lately and he apologized today and explained it's because he's trying to cope without drugs. He can be mean to me all he wants if he's quitting. Chrissy is Marc's sister. They're alot alike -- teases. Hurtful. I feel for him.  I guess that's it. David bought the Tenacious D dvd and it's hilarious so I think I'll take a break from life and watch it.   "What makes you and KG so fucking bloody awesome?"    .heart.

       urlLink    .madam.me.  Yep, that's me. Eh.. not much there but a fake smile and a pale girl.  I think what has kept this journal.. diary.. whatever.. alive so long is the fact that it's so private. I don't have to worry about what I say about anyone, because no one will find out and those who care to click on this don't really care.  I feel so free here.  I have been allowed back on the computer for awhile now, actually two days after my "punishment".  David and I didn't go to counseling, Judy and Larry did. And they duked it out. When everyone got home I was sent downstairs to stand under the laundry chute and listen to my brother's fate. I heard my dad chasing him, physically pinning him down, and him crying and screaming, and more yelling. And for every curse word that was shouted, every mean thing I heard, I took another pill. I must've taken about 17 sleeping pills.. I lost count. Once my mother came down and was very sarcastic and cruel and asked whose idea it was to skip. I never gave her a direct answer. I did tell her I didn't want to stay in this house anymore.. she mocked me, turned off my lights and slammed the door. I stayed down there, shivering until I was called up. It had all boiled down to, once again, David's depression. Now, not that I don't think my brother isn't ill, because it's pretty obvious he is, but sometimes I just think he likes being the center of attention. I prefer being ignored, whether I'm getting praised or punished.. I'd rather be ignored.    After the whole family was crying I asked if David and Judy could start talking to each other again, since they have been shunning each other for weeks. They called a truce, and decided to start over.     The next day, I went to Starbucks with friends. She picked me up like everything was fine. I guess I never really was punished. That same day, David and I skipped fourth hour and sat down in counseling with Miranda Carter. Miranda is the same girl that I apparently "betrayed" David with because I talked to her for a minute while I was suppose to be sitting quietly with him. [See 2/27] He flipped out on me that night, said he didn't care about me, blamed me for his problems. I never got an apology.. I can't believe how many tears I've wasted because of him pushing guilt on me. We didn't really  go  to counseling, we really just sat down there and messed around because we didn't feel like going to fourth hour.   This week I was sent to counseling again. The counselor said I looked very distressed when I was sitting with David and Miranda and also I had written a district essay on David and his depression that made everyone worried. She really upset me, I didn't mean for the school to pry in to my personal life. David does have help, and once I told her that she should've let me go before I started crying. But she couldn't, and I was soon making nasty noises trying to hold in my tears. She really upset me, and all through lunch I tried to stop crying. I couldn't, especially with all but one of my friends not knowing what is going on and asking me, "What's wrong?" One of them that was so oblivious sat there talking about how teen suicide has raised 60% in the last blah-blah-blah years. I got up, went to the bathroom while the only friend that could told everyone to fucking shut up about suicide and to try to put two and two together. When I came back they were on a different topic. Sex. It's either sex, drugs or suicide. I'd rather it be sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll but I guess times are different now. When lunch was about over Mallory walked me to the office so I could use the phone and call Judy. She could tell something was wrong (duh) and came and got me. I went to her office because it was easier than taking me home, and since the doctor wasn't there (on vacation) they didn't have any patients. All the girls at the office already knew what I was going through and so I didn't get bombarded with questions I didn't want to answer. I had forgotten my aunt, Dorothy, worked there with Judy because she had just recently started. She seemed to be the most help and I hadn't realized how she had been in the same position as me when I was her age. Her older sister was into drugs, getting kicked out of the house, boys. She was in the middle with her sister and her parents and she told me that I have to remember to live my own life. I really have forgotten to. Fuck, I can't remember the last thing I've done just for me to have fun without worrying about David or my parents. Wow. I got a 5 on the district essay. That's off the grading scale.. a 4 is a 100%. I don't care... David got sent to the counselors because of it, too. Boy, I got an earfull from him.    Which leads me to now. My parents are on vacation this weekend because Monday is their 20th anniversary. Maybe they'll learn to be friends again. We'll see. They're in Chicago and of all people to "watch" us, it's Judy's mom. She's rather annoying and makes me feel uncomfortable. I know it must seem horrible to think this, but she's pretty useless to me. She's never offered me much, emotionally, mentally or physically. Which makes me wonder what her purpose in life is? To fuck up as many children as she can? Look at Judy, I think she's accomplished it.    That was cruel and sour. I take it back. I am sorry.  My red nails are pretty, I adore them.   I wish someone else would, too.    .heart.

I think I'm finally going to say how I'm not happy here how my family isn't right and how I don't want to be here  Maybe I can live with my grandparents?  I didn't cut.  I overdosed to calm me down. Seven pills really makes you mellow... Or was it ten pills..? I don't care.   Give me strength to come clean    .heart.

        So, me and david skipped school today.  It wasn't  planned  but that doesn't make a difference I just  don't care  With this home life and work and my dog and my life i just.. don't care.  My computer is going to be taken away they found out pretty fast I guess I didn't really care enough to convince them I really was Judy Brandon when I called in sick She said she expected David called us in sick She didn't expect this kind of behavior from me yeah, David told me to David's too lazy to do anything himself He wouldn't pick up the phone when Judy called I'd been sleeping  But, overall, I don't care.  Chester's going to be put down soon I feel sick thinking about it  My life is horrible  Seeing Marc this weekend with some girl but having to sit on his lap because there wasn't enough room in the cars  I feel horrible  And Stuart smiling at some girl  I'm so ignored And I am a horrible person   if no one will care about me why should i care about them?    .heart.    p.s. this will be my final entry for awhile so be sure to read it slowly

      Talking to Dustin. He wants to be a private investigator and is looking into it. He told me that he reunited a son and father not too long ago after tracking down his dad. Sometimes it's hard to believe he's as accomplished as he says he is at 16, with an online jewlery store and running all sorts of businesses. I've been known to be a bit gullable.  I don't know what else. I've been ditched too much and my self-esteem has gone down the hole. Luckily, I didn't eat too much. I really have been trying to cut back. Today I've eaten a no-carb, no-sugar ice cream bar and a bagel. Tomorrow I'd like to go with even less. I'm just way too big.   My parents were trying to cheer me up as I cried on the couch about how everyone ditches me.   I get really hurt really easily.  I guess that's why I'm so emo. I feel things way too deeply.  I need to change myself. Not really my personality or ideas, but my appearence and the way I present myself for everyone to see.   Here's to a new chapter    .heart.

      It's kind of weird how I work. Or rather, don't work. I was depressed last night, just really depressed. It hurt to lift my voice up and say, "Nothing" when Larry asked me "What's wrong?" It always pisses me off that when I'm so obviously hurting inside Judy never puts down her remote, or book, or whatever and asks me what's wrong in a serious, worried voice.  And then online. I can't really expect people to help me online when I don't even know why I'm feeling bad. Just go along with the conversation. There's no tone of voice online. I did talk to David. He said I need medicine. Zoloft. Heh..  Right.  David and I ended up watching a movie, his lame attempt to make me feel better. He left in the middle of it which made me feel even more alone. And I start getting paranoid when I'm sad, too... I had to turn on all of the lights, and eventually I went upstairs and laid on the couch with the TV on. This morning I woke up around seven, and went and laid on my parent's bed. Fell asleep till about 10:30 or so. I was feeling okay until I read my friend's journal. She's heartbroken, and I think it's from some guy at work. I feel horrible for her, mostly because it's probably how I'll be in a couple of years. She's 19. She thinks she's fat, but she really isn't.. she's 5'0. I wish I could cheer her up. Speaking of height and weight, apparently I'm overweight. So the doctor says. Which makes me feel even more shitty and I'm close to tears whenever I think about it. Judy, I guess, was trying to make me feel better by pulling out her weight watchers chart and proving that for my height I'm not overweight. What she also proved was like.. three more lbs and I will be overweight. I was so close to crying and she just kept pulling out more charts and more and I just ran downstairs and she called back, "Dinner's ready!" and I said, "I'm not hungry." So here's the deal. I need to lose ten lbs. Really, I do.  Skyler: got my brekfast   Kevin: nice spelling job fucktard Kevin: lol Skyler: i didnt spell job.,   Skyler: i dont get it   Kevin: wow  Skyler made plans with me today. She's so flaky though, who knows? Her and madi and I are suppose to go to her pool because, apparently, they miss me. Madi's going to invite some guy -- "Scotty G" who plays some crazy bass. I'm not really sure if I'm looking forward to it or not -- I just feel so fat. Maybe I could go puke up as much as I can.   I've been reading Dani's journal, too. Man, she really took a dive. It seems like it all started with drugs, too. I know she doesn't think much of it, but she's had sex with about 3 different guys without condoms, and she's having major ups and downs. I'm already fucked up, I don't need drugs. It's so sad reading her journal, she just says, "I fucked Brian last night." like "I had two pieces of toast for breakfast." It's just sad, really. I'm sure she doesn't realize how downhill she's gone.   I hate feeling emo. No one helps.    .heart.

        urlLink  I adopted a cute lil' emo fetus from Fetusmart! Hooray fetus!    Okay, so, this is going to be a little overwhelming to read since I haven't been able to write for awhile. My computer got attacked with viruses and I'm too ignorant to ask for help. I got it fixed on my own though after about a week of trying. Okay, so here's how everything went. I'll just have to summarize and later get in to detail when necessary.  The trip was good. Larry really enjoyed it, and I guess that's what mattered most. The first night we just slept in a hotel and continued driving. Finally we got up to The Great Sand Dunes and we spent the night in a nice cabin. We climbed some of the sand dunes but didn't make it all the way to the top. (Larry was tired). After that, we continued driving until... I think we camped. In a really remote, beautiful area. We did some hiking, too. Then we went up to Durango and rode the train and white-water rafted. It was fun. We took a rest day, we were so tired from all of the excitement. I'm sure we did more, but my mind is really blank now. We came home a day early because we were pretty home sick for our dogs. We picked up David from Grandpa's house on Sunday.   Starting the following Monday I had field hockey camp. I puked the first day because of the heat and the pressure, and the rest of the days pretty much sucked, too. I couldn't really find anyone I knew and all those private school girls aren't all that nice. I'll be sure not to go back there next year. I'm pretty sure they thought I sucked, too, but I wasn't really motivated to play good until they treated me o.k. Oh, Annelise was there, but she didn't "kick my ass" like Marc told me she wanted to. She was polite, we didn't talk to eachother but once. Speaking of Marc, he spent the night that Sunday. I didn't sleep much -- he starts tickiling me and just trying his best to annoy me. "Stop, Marc!" "..But it's fun to annoy Allies!" "Annoy a different Allie!" "You're closest!" I guess I should have gone in to a different room but part of me didn't want him to stop. He also spent the night Saturday night, with Nate. He came over and layed next to me on our couch and kept telling me to pat his head and all. I'm not sure what to really do. I need to make myself go somewhere else when he spends the night.  What else? I feel bad writing this so late because I know I'm leaving out so much. Father's day was okay, I guess. I got to see my neice which I haven't seen in ages. She's five now. She didn't really care much to see me but she acted like she lived for our dogs. Hah. I guess I was that way when I was five, too.   Oh, I just remembered. Sunday and Monday night I went out with people from work. Stephanie, Dan, and Amanda the first night and Stephanie, Dan, Mike, and Anthony the second. Stephanie has the reputation for being a slut, but hey, that's none of my business. Dan was kinda all over her the first night, and then the second night she was more interested in Anthony. Anthony and Mike go to my school and are in my grade, so I know them pretty well. We played minigolf the first night and then went back to Stephanie's house to watch Finding Nemo since I had never seen it before. The second night Amanda went out with all of her friends, and since Stephanie and her hang out with the same group of people she felt kinda left out. We went bowling though, and then drove around for the longest time. Dan and I were following Stephanie and the boys, and she was just saying that she'll decide where to go whenever she comes across a place that looks appealing. Everything was closed though, since it was 11. It was still fun, Dan and I joked around a bit and listened to music, just riding around. We ended up going back to Stephanie's house and we played football in the backyard. It was okay, I guess, considering I didn't really touch the ball once. It was still funny to see everyone fall on the wet grass. By the end we were all pretty wet and there was grass everywhere. We jumped on the trampoline a little, but Anthony kept trying to 'jump' me and I knew I would just go flying since I was the littlest one there. We went home afterwards, around midnight or so. Stephanie told me today that she asked Anthony is he was serious about what we were joking around about. We came up with a lot of "inside jokes" and one of them was, "Do you like it on top or bottom?" We originally thought up this one in a round of minigolf and Stephanie's ball was on top of everyone's in the whole and someone said, "Yeah.. Stephanie likes it on top." So, yeah, she was asking him about hooking up. He turned her down, blew her off, and we think it's because of something Amanda said to him. Oh well, not my beef. I don't care too much, but I think it's funny how Stephanie is so persistant to get Anthony. It's really awkward around them now, so I hear.  Tony came over last night in an attempt for me to cheer him up. It didn't work. Another Caitlin victum. Poor heart broken guy. He kept telling me how stupid he is for falling for her after I warned him, "She'll trip you, Tony, and I just don't want you to get a skinned knee." She i/med me later, letting me know that she doesn't trip boys and that she's sorry I think that. I'm sure she took me literally, all though it was suppose to be a metaphor. Eh, I hate teases. She acts like she can't get involved with Tony unless it's going to be long term when she's a huge slut without going out with anyone. God forbid you have morals.  Oh well, I guess that's it for now.   back to dashboard    .heart.

      Finals. I don't know why I'm slacking off so much this semester -- I really do need to get on with the studying. Life has been shitting on me lately, though. Casey calls, late, saying she can't give us a ride for some bullshit reason. I go upstairs to tell David that he needs to get ready, fast, and he says that he's staying home because he has study hall first hour. So, my parents made a deal with him that if he studied all day he could stay home. They would never make a deal like that with me, because I always study and try my best. Do they realize how unfair that is? Do they realize how he controls them? By him not ever studying he gets to miss school to study for finals. It really, really pisses me off.   My head hurts.  I threatened to quit my job. I was sick of getting paid less and doing more work. I got a raise to $6/hour. I'm not sure if I'm just repeating myself or not, my mind is slush, but I apologize if I've already wrote all of this before. Normally you would not recieve $6 until you're 16, so it's pretty nice I guess. I'll get it the paycheck after next.  Larry and I, and possibly David are going on vacation Friday. Colorado. Yep. Backpacking, camping, rock climbing, hiking, rafting, horse back riding. I guess I'm looking forward to it.. I'm not so sure about how it will work out, though. It's hard for me to be in a good mood anymore. I hope we have a good time though. These are things I've been wanting to do since I was little, but Larry would never take me along with him on his trips with my uncle and grandpa. I guess what gives me the privledge to go along now is how I have recently gotten closer to my uncle, and he was mentioning to Larry how he should bring me camping with them. Of course, he said his daughter would get jealous. I've always been tougher than most girls, wrestling with my brothers and my guy neighbors, playing kickball and football. It was always so much fun. Then my prissy next door neighbor would come over.. about the only thing we did together was play barbies. I remember always being stronger than David and everyone else, but I wasn't mean enough to be the leader of our small group. I remember the pecking order perfectly: David, me, Jessica (Ms. Priss), Ryan (Neighbor boy), and Brendan (much younger, Ryan's brother). Mostly this order was by who could order who around, and poor Brendan took everyone's crap or went home. Every once in awhile we would challenge eachother, but we would fall back in to place again. Like a dog pack. I haven't seen Jessica in years, and I was surprised by Ryan's voice a couple of weeks ago. I guess I've neglected the fact that we're all growing up and growing away.    i miss my little group of friends.     .heart.

       Marc forgot my empanada. Figures. God, last night.. unforgetable. fuckkkk! it was so great. I want to tell EVERYONE about it but.. it's hard to figure out where to start!  So, I'm sitting in bed, been reading my book forever. About one a.m. I hear THREE pairs of footsteps coming downstairs, and a knock on my door. Guess. Just... Guess.  Marc and Stuart had snuck over, and David was wanting to know if I wanted to hang out. Sooooo happy. They went home in an hour, to make their parents think they were in bed and then snuck back over. We watched a movie Stuart really enjoyed. Stuart and I played "footsie" under the blanket, I loved having him close. I think he thinks I like Marc, and Marc should totally be out of the picture... but he's not, which kills me. Anyway, Stuart and I just kinda.. layed for a bit. I'm sure it didn't mean nearly as much to him but.. that seems to be the way that it always goes.  After Stuart left... five-ish, David went to bed. Marc hung around for awhile later, against my wishes. It was pretty playful, though, like a big brother and a little sister wrestling. I got him pinned, mostly because he was laughing too much. It was a lot of fun, except he grabbed my chest a couple of times. It's Marc, what do you expect? Anyway, when I got him pinned he actually asked me something serious. "Are you going to miss this?" I was totally shocked. He was being sincere. "Miss what? Me beating the shit out of you?" "Yeah." "Of course. No other Allie will beat the shit out of you in Texas, you'll miss this." (pinned him down again.) "There's an Allie in Texas that lets me grab her boobs." "Good, you can mess with her like that." "Why do you mind so much?" "You're leaving, Marc. You have a girlfriend. I don't see the point..."  The best news? Well, just take a look: Stuart: what are you up to tonight? TurnUpTheWeez: meh, just hanging out TurnUpTheWeez: yourself? Stuart: thinking about making a trip to your side of the tracks actually TurnUpTheWeez: you should. Staurt: i know that   so do i.      .heart.

        M arc  should  be coming soon. I guess you never  really  know with him, however. He is suppose to be bringing me an Empanada from Taco Bell after he gets off work. He'll have to shower and change, though. I know him too well. His sister is like that, too. Telling David she'll be over soon but she has to make sure and drown herself in perfume and look absolutly stunning and show up a half an hour late and act like she didn't really care if she came over or not. Psh. We know they love us. And they will be leaving soon. It's not really the idea of Marc leaving that I'm so sad about, it's the idea that the only boy that really ever made a pass at me is leaving. My first kiss. I have a couple more weeks, I guess, and if he plans on a 'special goodbye' I wouldn't be totally opposed. I mean, afterall, when's the next time I will see him? Who will know? I mean, I'm not talking anything huge, but I'm going to try to muster up the courage and at least give him a kiss on the cheek for a sweet little goodbye. I could play up the cute bit. I hate being considered cute but hey, I know how to use it. I don't consider myself cute by any means, but I think cuteness kinda shadows being short. The only perk.    I talked to Stuart recently. I told him exactly what I had been thinking: "We need to talk more." He actually agreed. Like, enthused. I was so happy. I said that we never get to talk enough and he did a, "I KNOW!" That made me so happy, I actually laughed. Yeah, I'll always love him. He's a clueless boy. It should stay that way.   Judy asked for a divorce. I don't feel like going into depth because for once, it's not my problem. I feel so free with that. It's not my problem. Don't come to me for advice, I'm just a kid. Yeah, I talked her in to it. If she's going to complain about how much he blah-blahs, then don't be with him so his blah-blahing won't annoy her. It makes sense, right? Well, I don't think they'll go through with it. Not until we're out of school. They think they're helping us by staying together. I don't really think David could care less but.. me? Well, I want them apart. I'm sick of the arguing and the tension and uh.. I want my  own  life.    The funny thing is, is that I'm more out of place with my friends than ever. We just don't laugh at the same things, and we're talking less and less. I guess I'm growing up even more, or just don't care enough to act. The only things we talk about now is romantic stuff. First kisses, cuddles and hand holding. They get sick of it but I never do. I'm a hopeless romantic like that, though. I could day-dream all night, get up in the morning with a big sigh like all of the things I've just drempt were actually true and I'd never been happier. Without actually going to sleep. Right. Get it? Just staring at my ceiling dreaming about this nameless boy. Funny, I could never dream myself to sleep thinking about Marc. He gets me embarrassed and shaky and just... Well, it doesn't matter. He's moving. Got to face that. It's 10:30 about now. Where is he, I wonder? I want to put on perfume and make myself all up. He use to get close like that, say my hair smells good and got close and just... well, held on. Now? We wrestle. Child play, an innocent way to get close and giggle. And when he let me pin him, and his head was turned, I saw he was trying to hold back a smile. It was great. That was just... the best. I knew I was making him smile and he couldn't even help it.       smile for me in Texas          .heart.

      "I wouldn't hold it against you if you divorced him, you know."  "..I was surprised to hear you say that."  "Why? Were you surprised to hear that I was thinking of it or that I wouldn't hold it against you?"  "..You just seem like the type of person that believes you should always stick by eachother, no matter what."  "Nah.. Dad's a jerk."   He actually says to her, "I'm right, you're wrong." in arguments. And then he comes back later and says that he tries so hard to work on their relationship but she's not helping. He blames everything on her and I'm really sick of it. He treats her so bad. God, I wish they would get a divorce. I was talking to Judy about it but she says there's no way she's divorcing him. Too stubborn to give up the house and everything she worked so hard for. And Larry probably won't, because I know he thinks he loves her. So, I'm stuck. Maybe I could talk them in to it. They were talking about divorce, but not until the kids are done with school.   That's too long.    .heart.

      I came home early from Mallory's house this morning. She was online for most of the night and i got sick of sitting there while she was chatting so i went to sleep earlier than her. And woke up earlier. Mallory was asleep next to me when I woke up and I was reading her book for awhile until her mom came in and asked if I wanted a ride home. I said yeah. I thought it was pretty rude of Mallory to sit online while I just sat there, being obviously bored. I don't think I'll spend the night over there again.   David had Nate and Kyle over. They were all obviously on something. While I was doing David's chores they turned the music way up loud and took off their shirts and started wrestling and giggiling and just being crazy. Stupid fucking stoners. Eric came over and he thought it was pretty funny, just sitting there watching the fucking stoners waste their lives. While I was cleaning up their fucking pizza. Doing David's fucking chores. And then Judy comes home and thinks I'm asleep on the couch. "Did Allie have a hard day?" Larry asked. And you know what she said? "No. She didn't do anything but sleep."    God, if only they fucking knew. I try to make them happy. To make this family actually work. I can't wait to fucking move out.  Judy was talking to me about Larry in the car again. "He's always mean to me. He said I watered the plants wrong!"  "What?! You're the one always taking care of the plants! You kept Lisa's plants alive when she went out of town!" "I know, I know. And then I said that and you know what he said?" "What?" "Well, I don't want to live in the same house as a person that doesn't love me." "Where did he get that from?!" "I don't know. I said, 'Fine, leave.' and he goes, 'Why should I? It's my house.' I just can't stand him."   Why don't they fucking get a divorce?  Judy was asking me what to do with David. "What do you think I should do?" I'm really sick of being the parent in this house. I told her to make him cough up reciepts for any money he spends, so she knows he's not buying drugs. Monitor his money so she knows he's not dealing. Watch who he hangs out with and who he calls. Take away his cell phone. Drug test him at the end of every month. If he's clean for 6 months, give him his cell phone. For a year? All privledges, but still watch him. I haven't told her everything yet, and I think she's still pretty trust worthy which is sad. While I was at choir camp she found a burn mark about the size of a cigarette in the table. That's how she finally figured out he was doing drugs.  TurnUpTheWeez: david has no idea I'm the one that makes up all the rules for him TurnUpTheWeez: or i'll hear he's going down to dierbergs to buy drugs TurnUpTheWeez: so i tell judy to question him and everything like she's the one that knows what's up TurnUpTheWeez: p mallory: thats a good idea mallory: its like an undercover spy! TurnUpTheWeez: yeah mallory: it could be fun! TurnUpTheWeez: heh.   i'd rather just be a 15 year old girl.    .heart.

      ..have I felt this shitty. This is a familar depression, one that I knew long before this diary. This is the old diary depression. I started to read my old diary again.   "i hate them both. they don't realize what bad parents they are. they both talk about their own family behind our backs. I heard my mom talking about my dad to his own father, and on the car ride home i said i'd be ashamed of myself if i were her. She got angry with me, obviously thinking it wasn't my place, and said I don't understand. Yeah, well, they don't bother to try to understand me. I don't want to know her. They have no idea what's going on and how I wake up every morning seriously considering suicide or on the way to school wishing a car would hit the bus, right where I'm sitting, or how I wish just someone, anyone, would burst into class with a gun and decide to just shoot me. They have no idea. Gee, I wonder why Allie gets bad grades and cries at night? We must not be yelling at her enough. They have no idea"  "I've asked her, so fucking many times if they were going to get a fucking divorce. Why didn't they just tell me? She would just crack a joke. Never giving me a straight answer. I haven't trusted her since I was eleven. Yeah, hugging me everyonce in awhile, talking to me about drugs and sex and boys, yeah, that makes it all better. Telling me stuff I already know. Stuff I've already made decisions on. That doesn't help, mom. She always talks about her mom was horrible, how she never had food, how her mom never did housework. Yeah, she's better than her mom, but I still turned into the mom when I was pretty little. Too little to be a mom. Fetching things for David and taking care of him and such. Feeding him, waking him up, making sure he put sunscreen on. Getting him his lunch. Making sure he had lunch money and wouldn't forget to buy that yearbook and 'lending' him money he didn't really need. I was still a kid. I still am a kid. It's not fair. And, yes, I am allowed to use that as an excuse because I still am a kid.    Four more years. Four more years."  "I was crying while emptying this dishwasher, right in front of my dad. He didn't even notice. My face was red and my eyes bloodshot and me wiping tears away, but as long as I kept my head down and voice steady he didn't notice a thing. No one did.   I know there's something wrong with me. No one else acts this way or seems to really have this much trouble with everything. It's so hard. It's just so hard."   fuck this.    .heart.

      Got back from choir camp a bit ago. Not much to say. It wasn't as exciting this year. It was my 4th year, Skyler's third. Last year we got a couple more friends to go and it was fun. Somehow I always feel like I get left out. Probably my own fault.  The best part about choir camp is the guys and lack of parents and adult supervision. We hang out with this guy named Evan every year. He's pretty attractive, but Skyler and I have a hunch he might be homosexual. No big deal, we just have to make sure we don't get a crush on him.   There was a couple of really attractive guys. All older, of course. We met a guy with his first name ryhming with his last. I think I should keep from mentioning full names in here. Poor guy. He was in our grade though, I wish we would have met him sooner. I met him just sitting down before performing for the last time. He was pretty nice and friendly and I think we would have had a good time together if we met eachother sooner. It kind of tics me off how Skyler "calls" every guy and then doesn't even try to talk to them. She'd get mad if I would make a move, though. Like the guy we met, him and I mostly talked and Skyler listened in. And suddenly he's "hers"? I guess it doesn't matter since I won't being seeing him until next year, anyway. I'm just crabby. We got 17 hours of sleep out of 72 hours. We had a good time.  My head hurts and I need to get back in the pattern of writing. I think my language is bad.. er.. terrible.. I need a thusarus or something.. oh, god.. and my spelling.   this is just getting embarrassing     .heart.

       i'm finally starting to eat again - not much, but just little bits. i keep thinking of that night, going through every little moment and smile and i just start to cry again. i was way too sure that we were just going to.. be together. simple.       I mean, right? That's how it works.    I-like-you-and-you-like-me-we-should-be-together deal.   And we SHOULD be together.      One thing - he i/ms me now. I can see him sign on and just wait - and sure enough, he i/ms me right away. That really means a lot, considering all the times before I was begging for him to notice me. He gets online every night around 10:30 or 11, and we talk 'till about 1 or so. I told him I still want him to come over and watch movies and talk with me, just as friends, though.       When he broke the news to me, that ngiht, he told me that he hadn't smoked all day. Mostly, he said, because he knew it'd make me happy.       I wonder what'll happen if I see him again. I mean, when it's not just the two of us. It'll be hard to be a part of the group.       Amendment 2 passed. Judy voted "Yes." I'm ashamed. The lower generation is so much more open-minded... and they're not even allowed to vote. I'm really embarrassed for this country. I can't believe we say that everyone has the same rights but we don't let certain people marry eachother. Gosh.      I really want Stuart to come over and just make everything better for me.       you came to me like a dream     the kind that always leaves     just as the best part starts     it ends so aburptly        .heart.

       this has been a really painful two days.   Stuart can't handle a relationship -   not enough time for me   and not emotionally stable.      i guess i can respect that   but it's just..   so hard.   and he's so sorry.   it's really hard to be mad at him.   god, i like him so much      i really don't think it's fair that i only got one night with him   after liking him for so long     this is so hard.           .heart.

       wow. wow. wow. wow.   I'm still trying to figure out if it was a dream or not.   So, Stuart came over, right?   Wow...   yeah, we hooked up.   Flirted a bit and then just started making out.   It was so passionate, too.   Not anything like Marc and I.   Marc was after my body... Stuart... he was actually looking at my face.   What's goofy on my part was   I was too shy to look him in the face   he kept lifting up my chin   brushing the hair out of my face   we got pretty hot and heavy   We spent the remainder of the night stealing kisses   and trying to cover up hickies.   Speaking of, anyone know how to get rid of them?   We iced them.. eh.      God..   I'm so happy.   He left at 6:30 with a passionate goodbye kiss   and the promise of a phone call I knew he couldn't keep   he had church in a couple of hours, and afterwords, work   I had work in a couple of hours, and when I got off I knew he'd be at work   he gets off at 10   so.. I'm trying so hard to not lose my mind thinking about everythings that happened   it's so hard to swallow   i love it when he calls me pretty   i know it's not really true   but he thinks he means it   and i love it   i love being with him      the whole day has been one big haze   i quit my job   they never gave me my raise   i stop going on aug 13   i opened a door on my face today   it hit me hard   there's actually a poofed up line on my face   i might have a concussion   i had such a bad day at work   but it doesnt matter   i just want to see him tonight   he better ask me out   i can't really imagine it getting any better than this   this is..   amazing.      a couple things have been bothering me.   1. when he came over the night before last he mentioned this girl taking him out after work. was it romantic? are they friends? i'll have to ask him   2. when did he decide to start thinking i'm beautiful! i've been waiting forever but i think i'll be devastated if he just realized not too long ago that he likes me.. like, he's only liked me for a day and.. yeah. Just because I've been hurting for him for so long I don't want to think he just suddenly picks me up without all the hurt and wanting and.. oh, fuck it. I'm so happy. So's Judy. She loves Stuart. I just told her that he likes me. She was so happy for me.   3. Stuart smokes. I'm going to try the very best I can to get him to stop. I don't like it at all. I kinda kicked his cigarettes under my couch and he said, "Oh, just what you want your parents to find." "I'd rather have them in my basement than in your pocket." He said that was sweet, lifted up my chin again and kissed me.      God, I love being with him. It's so different - us making out compared to Marc and I. Stuart holds me so close...      Everyone is so happy for me. And jealous. They all think we make the perfect couple.   The best thing? Stuart knows EVERYTHING about me. Cutting, fighting family, pill popping me. Well, that's all in the past.. well, the things that I can control are in the past now. He likes me anyway. We have 6 years of friendship behind us.. we'll be great.   Well.. once he asks me out..   and he better.      FAQ -   What does David think?   David doesn't know, David probably won't care. He should be happy for me though, he knows how long I've liked Stuart and has respected me for not being flaky and knowing what I want.      Wow. i need to calm down. I'm way too happy.       He kisses me on the top of the head        .heart.
