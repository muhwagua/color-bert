       1. The fight against the BNP took a step back yesterday. Interesting documentary for armchair liberals to sit back and say "Isn't that awful" but why give that weak, larded, shit-for-brains Nick Griffin 20 mins on every single news channel. Why? Five years ago he wouldn't have had the luxury of such a platform to spout his vomitous invect. He must be laughing hard and further secure in his bilious views today. Now Griffin has it in his mind he is fighting the government. Ironically if he is jailed, for some people he will have gained matyrdom in his own right. That's how fucked up it is to ever entertain such mediocre apologists. He's not even very good at what he does which is all the more frightening. I'm surprised that Blunkett hasn't waded in and said something to jeapordize any prosececution such is his guile and cunning.     2. The Butler Report. Actually I'm more interested in how this whole war will be remembered by history. They say that 50 years has to pass before anyone can objectively view an event in historical terms. But I'm sticking with the history is dead principle. Three different takes on the war.     "In 2002 Britain and the USA invaded Iraq in order to remove an evil dictator after he had defied twelve years of UN resolutions."     "In 2002 Britain and the USA ignored suspect intelligence and invaded Iraq to secure oil supplies against a backdrop of an increasingly unstable Saudi state."     "In 2002 Britain and the USA removed Saddam Hussein from power, creating a power vacuum in the middle east. The country became a melting pot for terrorists and foreign fighters which were to plague the West for decades."     Three statements from a fictional future all with very different emphasis. We have moved away from a single view of history (perhaps conspiracy theories were the mould for this.) As events occur there is an enormous amount of analysis and coverage. It will be difficult to sum up something as complex as the WMD debate so I guess they'll just say. "They never found any."     But you never know...Seventy years from now, Dwayne, a small boy from just outside Basra in the United States of Iraq will be walking through the desert. He can see the casino lights in the distance. Ouch. He stubs his toe and looks down. A rusty canister pokes its rusty nose through the sand...     3. I just bought some sunflower seeds to munch on as recommended by poo analysts everywhere. They are horrible. Are there any known ways of making healthy things taste mildly pleasant?     4.  Seinfeld  scripts online. Use these to begin an Amateur Dramatics Society at your local mudhut. Mmmm...not a bad idea.     5. Fantastically my bosses at work have said, no you have far too much to do, let me take some of that burden from you...Only if you're sure it's alright I whimpered.     Round, round, getaround, I getaround...      6. My sister is off to India tomorrow morning. I have asked for some new shirts, a baby elephantini, a digitial camera and some authentic Bombay potatoes.     7. It's OK to change your mind now and again. Alex Salmond changes his mind and wants to be leader again, I can understand that. But to say Black Holes, no mate got that well wrong oh and by he way they do something else now and I've named it after me...pah who knows.     8. Things that are like jazz but aren't jazz; Quantum Physics, Economics, Local government spending plans     Do you have anything to add to the list which basically needs to conform to my definition of jazz (see below)     Jazz - Something that people claim to understand with unabounding certainty although any serious attempt to understand it by any structured or logical methodology fails at the first fence.     9. Ha just read this. Blunkett considers making brothels legal. That's the most useful thing he's done since he was appointed. Sorry, I do take the piss out of him but he must face a massive disadvantage as a politician since so much of what we communicate is actually visual. That said, I don't think he's the brightest spark in the box but he definitely comes across as someone who works his ass off. Still not voting for them tho'. And on the prostitution side of things, I wish the girls every success.     10. I'm not a fan of the  Liberals  but c'mon lets give 'em a go. What's the worst that could happen?

      1.  Ellen MacArthur.  Wow you really can't get much more ballsy that her can you?  I'd join her fan club just for the chance to bounce up and down on her boat.  Yes I know.  I do have a  huge desire to travel round the world on an old ship like the Matthew or something a bit bigger perhaps.    2.  So if writing is heavenly and editing is divine, why does editing an economics lecturer's web pages feel like purgatory?    3.  Academics are supposed to have a reasonable grasp of their chosen language, how to successfully construct an argument and how to explain a simple concept to another individual aren't they?  There is a high volume of fuckwittage going on here today, let me tell you.  Aaargh, my own spelling and grammar are falling apart now.  It's like playing golf with a hacker.    4.  I wouldn't normally be one for nanny-state-stylee TV programmes like the one I mentioned yesterday, (You are what you eat) and the one I saw last night (How clean is your house?), mainly because in under normal circumstances we wouldn't need these programmes.  Such extreme economies produce extreme social behaviour which is being reflected on our screens.  I mean, tramps keep their bins in better nick.    5.  I'm a big fan of  urlLink Ben Goldacre's column  in the Guardian.    6.  It's been a bit of hectic day here at Dogfrog Towers (an imaginary place in my head).  I haven't burned as many grey calories since the great dribbling super macro drama of the early nineties.  Still it turns out that the old magic is still there.    7.  Watch The Secret Agent tonight at  9pm on BBC one.  Those cowardly BNP fuckers.  Grrrrrr...Ribbitt.    8.  My mate Martin is back from Cairo on business where it was 42 degrees.  How on earth do you bear it Nancy?  I'd spend most of my life in the fridge.    9.  Apparently there are two types of people in this life, those who steal and those who are stolen from.  Which one are you?    10. SQL,SQL,SQL,SQL,SQL,SQL,SSL,SQQSLQSLQSLLQSLQSSLQSL QSLLQSLQSLQLSLQSL,  diEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

      1. Have successfully registered a Gmail account! How did I do it? Set your self up a blog at blogger.com and it will offer you one. Bet you didn't know that. I am dogfrog@gmail.com. Cool as pants.   2. I have managed to download and configure Realplayer at work so now I can listen to the radio and more importantly the Test Match at work tomorrow. Man I tell you that makes you one productive worker.   3. My mum took some antibiotics yesterday and came out with a massive allergic reaction. She went round the local shop to get some milk and the massively fat shopkeeper asked her if she was alright. She explained her reaction and he said that happened to him last year and his genitals swelled up. Quite beautiful.   4. Did you see You are what you eat on Channel 4 last night? If you haven't seen that programme yet watch it, especially if all you eat is chips, pies, burgers, pizzas, frozen crap, fry ups, coca-cola, crisps and chocolate biscuits. I might even buy some sunflower seeds today.   There are only two diet rules that have ever meant anything to me.   Never eat anything bigger than your own head.   Remember you only have one arsehole.   5. I have tried to get in touch with Burberry without success. I'm trying to establish how many baseball caps they have sold in the last year so that I can do some statistical analysis.   6. Tabloid scum. Just read this on theugly from Mr Jolly... a chum of mine who has just returned from Portugal had this tale to tell...  He was drinking outside a bar that was populated with England fans inside, and French fans outside. Apparently, a couple of Sun journos went up to the French with a wedge of cash - 3000 euros to be precise, and tried to bribe them to kick off with the England fans. The French duly accepted the cash, went into the bar and flopped the money on the bar, telling the England fans what had happened - by this time, the scum had clocked what was going on and legged it. Thus the English and French fans were able to enjoy a bloody good pish up on the Sun! As I said, tabloid scum.   7. Top 3 sandwich fillings...   Bovril, cheese and ham filled with salt and vinegar crisps Cheese and rhubarb chutney filled with cheese and onion Chicken, mayonnaise, onion relish, worcester sauce crisps   8. It's amazing that  urlLink this  sort of thing can still happen.  9. I've just had an email from Ahmet in Belarus. It begins...Hello Mr Mett. I can just imagine him saying that. well it made me laugh anyway.   10.  urlLink This site  is a travesty of taste.  The Princess is a design classic along with the Allegro. I remember the registration plate on my dad's old Allegro, VAA 29R. Now that's a long story.

      1.  Only 9% of Muslim applicants got an interview in a recent study.  Any organisation that really wants to be non-discriminatory when selecting candidates for interview, could do so in the drop of a hat.  Name and personal details go one way to Personnel, the application form itself to the manager making the appointment.  Obviously in many companies, those two roles are the same person but not in big companies or corporations.  On the whole I think big organisations don't like their employees to have difficult decisions to make, they like to keep them in their comfort zones.  2.  Oow fantastic more on the 419rs.  urlLink Here at the BBC .      My favourite is still the  urlLink 419eater .   Have a look at the trophy room.  3.  It's time to re-choose my random words should I ever bump into Derren Brown.  4.  What a frustrating end to Waking The Dead.  Poor as a church mouse with writers block.  5.  I'm gonna start a sweep stake on my new goatee.  It's usually off before it's been on a month.  I find them so itchy.  Any tips for goatee maintenance ladies?  6.  Last night was one of the weirdest nights sleep I've had for years.  I kept having these ultra vivid dreams that would wake me up.  No sooner than I put my head on the pillow I'd have another one and wake up again.  I lost count eventually but I do remember one dream which involved 9 suicide parachutists in Istanbul.  They killed 1800 people.  Hope that one doesn't come back to haunt me.  7.  Ross Noble goes into my all time top three genius list.  Listen to his hilarious adventures at the BBC site  urlLink    8.  Arghhhhhh!  We are going to lose Beattie aren't we?  the Guardian thinks so.    urlLink    9.   A friend of mine who works in Waterstones in Picadilly met Bill Clinton in the toilets.  He couldn't resist it and got a picture of Bill's old man with his picture phone.  I can't possibly post it.  10.  I'm a bit of an uncommunicative twat at times especially on the phone and by email.  It's not that I don't keep in contact, it's just that I'm no good at small talk or idle chitter chatter.  I guess then that this Journal/Blog is a fantastic therapy. I certainly feel alot happier since I started it and I hope it brightens someone's day.

      1. I made it back alive. I know some of you are from Brighton so I will choose my words carefully :) Everyone was really pleasant and friendly which I thought was amazingly unusually for the South of England. In my experience the further north you are the friendlier the folk but full marks to Brighton for being super friendly and helpful. Something does trouble me about Brighton tho' I can't put my finger on it. It's not London-On-Sea as I've heard it described but from the looks of things, it is a place with an identity crisis. It is the home of the stag and hen. You have to wear trews and shoes to get into the clubs (unheard of in Bristol), yes the pier and front are tacky, but...at it's heart there are bags of top shops and thriving music scene. The marina is fantastic and there are some excellent restaurants. There are busloads of young people and there is a great atmosphere. I'd love to do take a brassy blonde and have a traditional dirty weekend there. Drive down in a convertible, day trips to the South Downs, any takers? Anyhoo thank you Brighton.  2. No thank you Psyche Mikey keeping me up until five and twenty to six you evil shit.  3. A friend of mine has a good friend C who is how shall I say a bit slow on the uptake. Recently they went to a wedding. Some of the guests were gay and two guys introduced themselves to C. "I'm Todd and this is my partner Michael." C looks quizzical and says "Are you two cops?"  4. What's the point of a pier anyway when you have perfectly good land to build on?  5. I have found alot of things irritating of late, mainly shabby TV. I would rather cook my own fingers like sausages than listen to another minute of Jeremy Vine's voice. Last night, excellent documentary, dreadful commentary. I find it very difficult to imagine geology if someone just explains it. Secondly that forensic programme on after it. The writing, the structure, and the characterisation was shocking. The Claire Goose character, oh dear. The Trevor Eve character, is an arsehole. No need.  6. I think my post staggy hangover is in the post and it's late.  7. I am checking the national press for my theory on Rooney. I bet that journo I met will nick it. Peter Crouch, £2milllion? Did I miss something? Isn't he Ormerod in disguise?  8. Had a long chat with my contact. He's gonna put me in touch. He's got connections everywhere. He is the gatekeeper to the next level, at last I have found him.  9. I am not above dirty jokes. Two women on their way back from the pub stop in a cemetary for a pee. The first one takes off her knickers and dries herself, the second is wearing no knickers so she grabs a ribbon off a nearby wreath. The next day their husbands were discussing events. "I'm not letting my wife go out with yours again, she came home with no knickers on last night." "That's nothing, mine came home with a card up her arse saying we'll never forget you, love from all the boys at the fire station."  10. Listen to Gordon Brown's plans this afternoon. Madness abounds. No one ever saved any money through efficiencies. It's a paper saving that will never be realised and he will put us in hock. Economic disaster looms, I give it three years before you all have negative equity and no jobs. No one's got a better plan though. My local MP is standing down at the next election, perhaps I should run? Anyone know anyone in the Labour party who can swing my nomination? Politics is all about lying, nepotism and who you know so I am starting in a bad lane. I'm a rubbish liar, I do not have any well placed family members and I don't really know anyone. Well we've all got to start somewhere.

      1. I'll get straight to it. Last night/this morning I had a fairly chaotic dream. The Incredible Zac had turned into a rat and then turned into a fruitbat and then I lost him. Hmmm...should I change my username to Ratbat? Then the dream changed, I don't know how or why but I was in a hotel room with Liv Tyler She was naked save for the most beautifully intricate floral tattoo that ran across her left breast down to her thigh like Miss World sash. She was also amazingly soft and rounded to the touch, not something I would normally associate with Liv Tyler, but who knows how my imagination works? And then I lost her. The most beautiful thing in the entire fucking world and I let her go. I suspect that if I ever was in a relationship with someone I found incredibly beautiful I'd be scared to death.  2. Spoke with an old friend last night who told me that someone we used to work with was stopped boarding a flight to Portugal a couple of weeks ago because he was a suspected football hooligan. Apparently he's now been banned from attending a footie match ever again. It's strange, we just assumed he was a pisshead who fell over alot. That explains all the black eyes.  3. We have a lecturer here who has been banged up by the Slovenian authorities twice now because they keep getting him mixed up with a master criminal wanted by Interpol. He looks nothing like the slag in question and has a different name. Apparently the geezer even has a big tattoo on his arm. If it were me I'd track this fella down myself. A woman in my office just said that she used to get the words deed poll and Interpol mixed up. She went around saying that she wanted to change her name by Interpol. Hmmm...not a bad idea actually.  4. I'm disappointed. It's results day here at the University and I haven't seen one student crying in a corridor.  5. Ha ha ha, I've fixed my calendar problem. Hell its only taken two days. It's funny how such nerdy things can make me so happy.  6. My Liv Tyler thread reminds me of a story that a friend told me once. He went for an interview as a curator at the British Museum. After lots of questions they finally got to the big test. Nick, could you go to the table over there and bring us back that teapot. Please pretend that it is a highly valuable teapot so show us how you would handle it. Nick walked over to the teapot and sized up the situation. With the utmost care and with both hands he gently picked it up and tip-toed back across the room. With even more delicacy he put it back down on the table in front of the interview panel. A voice came from the panel. "Tell us Nick, do you think picking up an antique tea pot by the handle and the spout is a good idea or a bad idea?"  7. Why Liv Tyler anyway? I've seen her in the LOTR films obviously and one nice film set in France. I think there is a bit of cross fertilization going on between her and a woman who's on Deep Space Nine, which I don't even watch.  8. This seems weirdly appropriate. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3879447.stm  9. Anyone watch the Stress Test on BBC2 the other night. It was all about Ian Holloway, legendary Bristolian and QPR manager. He once said. ".....My day didn't start very well.....the Holloway household had to have our dog put down unfortunately, but that's life. I've just said to the lads: 'You're born and you die on a date. You've got to work on the dash in the middle'....."  and another on whether his team plays sexy football.  "To put it in gentleman's terms, if you've been out for a night and you're looking for a young lady and you pull one, you've done what you set out to do. We didn't look our best today but we've pulled. Some weeks the lady is good looking and some weeks they're not. Our performance today would have been not the best looking bird but at least we got her in the taxi. She may not have been the best looking lady we ended up taking home but it was still very pleasant and very nice, so thanks very much and let's have coffee"  10. Bet he wouldn't say that about my Liv.

      1. I decided to have a go at the Trick of the Light story title. I hadn't written anything for ages and I was surprisingly pleased with the result. It'll be put up tomorrow so please let me know what you think. I really liked all three of the other stories. I hope some more people have had a go.  2. Belle and Sebastian's Stay Cool is too cool for words.  3. Visual Basic is doing my nut this week. It's like a circular maze. I'm out of maze practise badly. Hmmm lets hope I can deliver what I said I would.  4. My word, all the people in my new office are literati. This should be a chance to demonstrate my ignorance to astonishing levels. Fantata.  5. We were the only two single men going to this wedding in August. But now my best mate has just told me that his ex-Kiwi porn star girlfriend will be over from Oz for it. I am now a lone wolf sans wingman.  6. Todays musings are taking a while it must be said, not that I have a lack of anything to say. I'm trying to build a pop up calendar and reminder system in MSAccess. If I'm having this much trouble building a calendar, how much effort is a time machine likely to be?  7. I've changed the ending to my Trick of the Light. The first one just didn't work.  8. Apparently a brother of some guy my sister works with stabbed himself to death on saturday night. It's not until you write all this stuff down that you realise how many terrible things happen around you without you ever knowing about them. They say you are never more than 3 metres from a rat, I say that you're never 3 minutes away from someone who's gonna die in the next 3 weeks. Nobody work out the real stat please, I'd rather not know.  9. Apparently we are going powerboat racing in Brighton on saturday and mud-buggying in the afternoon. I must admit I've always wanted to go in a powerboat. Why don't they make tanks bigger btw? I guess they would sink in the mud. Sorry boys moment. If any Brighton regulars go out on a friday, apparenltly I will be in the Smugglers? I haven't been to Brighton for about ten years. Anyone know a Dave Pribelzski?  10. It's thursday and I'm going home to miserably wet Wales. The words DVD and a bottle of wine, seem to be calling me.  Evening folks.

      1. I listened to a Radio 4 programme on my way home from "work" last night, it was about blasphemy. It really got me thinking, not about blasphemy but what people feel when they are offended by something. I can't recall the last time I was offended, even personally (Rhino skin me), let alone religiously or otherwise. What do you feel when you're offended? Emotionally hurt, defensive, angry, battered pride. It's rejection. You can challenge a person's reasoning, their methods, even their values to an extent but their belief system is often too strong. If you challenge a person's beliefs, it's saying to them, I reject you on the most fundemental level and that's got to hurt. Remember that when you're having a three pint rant at the soft Christian girl in the pub.  Being an athiest dog that I am, I suppose that I do find some of the far right Christian fundamentalist and the Creationists offensive in the sense that they insult my intelligence, but I choose not to listen to them. In the US I guess blasphemy and even religious intolerance is protected by the 1st Amendment? Should we have an equivalent law in the UK? It's a thought.  2. I have adopted Mozilla. So far so good. No pop ups anyway although it's a bit slooooooooooooooooooowwwww.  3. I'm in charge of about 40 distance learning students. Strange, I've always found it near impossible to learn something from a distance. I guess I'm hard of listening.  4. What happens when your belief or value system is shattered? Let's just say for a hypothetical minute that we find irrefutable proof that God is a bunch of baloney (For the record I think the proof is all around us in the same way that they say he is...). I guess what happens is that your beliefs are either reinforced but for the majority watered down over time. Did you see the Second Coming with Christopher Ecclestone last year which was spooky and thought provoking. Either way I'm happier thinking about God as a marketing tool rather than a belief system.  5. I'd like to know more about how an idea or a concept becomes a belief, answers on a postcard.  6. Did anyone catch the end of the Diana Dors program on Channel 4 the other night? I had to go out before it finished. I got to the bit where the techies had decoded the names and the locations. What happened next?  7. Coupland is a nutter. Pages and pages of what people are thinking, nutty conversations and irrelevant background and then in two lines he describes a bank robbery or a car crash. BAM BAM. I love it. These things do happen in split seconds and last for minutes with the result that they affect the rest of your life. Our brains have a tendency to crumble like a badly made Victoria sponge, hence the belief system I guess.  8. If unlike me you have kids, this is a really good site for the holidays. [http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/] As a kid I loved touring museums expounding the virtues of the agricultural revolution. You have a duty to put your kids through the same hell.  9. I need to convince someone that what the world needs is a definitive rollercoaster road movie book. I'll call it "On the Rails."  10. A man goes into a bar and says, "Have you heard any jokes about me?" "No." says the barman.

Comment by: dogfrog (Posted on 07-06-2004 at 06:46 am)  Comment: Nancy, I'm not intolerant towards Christians far from it actually. A little unsympathetic possibly, but not intolerant. I agree my tone may have been a bit dismissive. :( sorry Nutters was referring to extreme Christian (mainly American right wing) groups. Sorry for any confusion caused. In the course of the discussion that I listened to, it was argued that some far right groups are combining religious language with their hate messages so that in effect any attempt at a blanket blasphemy law in any country (blasphemy in the UK refers to Christian, mainly Anglican, faith), would be pointless. Each to their own is my motto, I've been thinking about what drives us apart and sometimes I think that people need to understand what offends us even before we get to the discussion phase. Alot of atheists dismiss out of hand Christian teachings and beliefs. I don't on the premise that our history tells us that on the whole we need beliefs, heroes, idols, gods etc to stop us going insane and tearing each other apart. On a ph*losophical level, no I don't believe. I'll edit nutters out since the meaning is wrong. Delete this comment.

Comment by: dogfrog (Posted on 07-06-2004 at 07:26 am)  Comment: Unfortunately living in a such a secular country as the UK, alot of people have a derogatory view of religion as a whole, Christian, Muslim or otherwise. Even church going Christians are seen by a good deal of the population, as "weird in some way" but if you asked 1000 people in the street I bet 700 would still say they believe in (a)God. I associate it with a number of things. Religion became seriously unfashionable in the eighties. In the sixties, eastern religions were all the rage. In the seventies there was even a healthy CofE that even backed CND. At the beginning of the eighties there were more people going to church on a sunday than football on a saturday. But religion didn't really fit well with Thatcherism and the greed is good message didn't cross back over either. In more recent times, the western media has reinforced ideas that any type of devotion to any religion is somehow wacky or fundamentalist, (see first Waco and then Iraq etc). I think esp, in relation to Islam there is a real war against intelligence. The Muslim faith requires a good deal of resolve, discipline and intelligence and sometimes I think the West finds that very worrying. I find that intensely sad. But now I sense that people are looking for more spiritual things in the West, perhaps things will come full circle one day and we can have those witch burnings you've all been missing. Sorry I'm rambling like an arse trombone today. Ignore me. Delete this comment.   Comment by: discopants (Posted on 07-07-2004 at 03:13 am)  Comment: Just thought I'd add a note on the intolerance of Christians to atheists. I'm an atheist but I attended a Christian Union meeting at University at the request of a friend with whom I'd discussed religion and why people believe, so that I could understand their viewpoint better. They had a guest speaker whose basic mantra was 'if you don't believe in God, you're a rotter who'll probably end up in prison'. Despite the best efforts of my friend (a staunch Christian) to intervene, he carried on in this vein and I walked out. I realise, of course, that this guy was probably a one-off but he was a guest speaker- I hope they didn't invite him back to spout more rubbish! Delete this comment.

Comment by: Faerie (Posted on 07-07-2004 at 05:15 am)  Comment: discopants.. its a shame that there are people like that.. it pisses me off just as much as it does you. what that man was saying was absolute crap and if he actual read the Bible he'd realise that from a christian view point how messed up his opinion is.  but i think you'll find that there are people like no matter their beliefs.. atheists, muslims, jews, christians.. whatever.. no one is faultless.

      1. Started my new job today. The word doddle doesn't really cover it. My sister came up with a new word this weekend. Odge. To reverse in your car on the brake. ie i was odging backwards when I hit the pensioner.  2. I can feel the surge, the mania and the relief as another flash of inspiration develops in my grey ripples.  3. Never put fibregel in a bread maker. Top tip that.  4. Recently I have watched Big Fish, Lost in Translation, Mystic River and thought them all ok-ish but nothing wonderful. Last night I watched Robocop and found it far more satisfying. The laughter, the tears...  5. Met a puppy version of the Incredible Zac which was nice because I never saw him when he was all fluff’n’stuff.  6. My new office is cold on both levels. When I ask a question I keep expecting the people to lead with “Are you fucking stupid or something?” Little do they know. *evil smirk*  7. I have been a bit slack with reading and reviewing people’s work lately; mainly due to my PC mainlining 250,000 volts. But I resolve to read a lot more now I have a job that pays me for doing sweet FA.  8. Has fiction become unfashionable? You poets are breeding like rabbits and I’m not sure what’s coming out is all rabbits.  9. It’s unbelievably nice to be sat somewhere quiet without the bilious rub of the Witches of Eastwick that has driven me to arrhythmia for the last twelve weeks.  10. I don’t know if I’ve just got worked up about it, but it is one of the most annoying, incomprehensible and pointless things that I’ve witnessed for a while. It is basically beyond trying to argue with; it is…well, boring.  I'm just not fucking interested in it or what it has to say.  Fuck it.

      1. IT'S JULY. SO HOW COME ALL THE RAIN?????  2. Sorry to bang on about the library but it's noiser than a playgroup screaming for ice-cream, hang on it is a playgroup screaming for ice-cream; and one of the library assistants asks me to stop talking on my mobile???? It's all I can do to withold an obscene gesture.  3. Almost got into a fight last night outside the video shop. It was all about parking in a disabled spot, i.e we were both arguing over the space. I don't think he was quite prepared for my response. I don't do fighting mainly because I'm rubbish at it and go over the top. Manslaughter my arse. What's worse parking in a disabled space or using a disabled toilet? Now there's one that'll run and run on the forum.  4. International Wife Swap called back last night. They are definitely up for it. They are going to hook me up with some trailer bait from Idaho and her 4 kids probably called Wayne, Dwayne, Cindy Jo and something ending in "ene". I'm quite up for it. As ever I have a plan and I'm not sure but I think it may end in the destruction of either the trailer park or Idaho itself. Either way I'm buying a fast car and parking it nearby just in case. The only problemette I have is to find a wife who can enjoy the company of someone called Cletus. I will advertise in Variety unless you fancy it Sooz?  5. Went to Southampton yesterday to visit the grandparents. I hope my last words to my Grandad won't be the last. "So long and thanks for all the rhubarb."  6. That reminds me. Rhubarb crumble this afternoon. I'm toying with Rhubarb chutney, not literally.  7. Go Greece Go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll wrap up all my footie nonsense in one paragraph. Saints have signed Swedish midfielder Mikael Nilsson. He's a bit of a play anywhere player which I admit I'm never very keen on. Rumours persist around James Beattie. Personally I think it's his destiny to leave and lead us into the next World Cup.  8. Here's some pointless infantilism. Put your postcode in http://places.jump-around.com/closest//  9. After two days of virtual traction after my surfing extravaganza, Timbo wants to go again this weekend. "Only if you can buy me a titanium spine on Ebay"  10. I've been off all week and let's face it, have accomplished very little indeed. I am still sans PC, hence my irregular library based postings. Monday sees a change to all that. Back to the Uni for hours and hours of mindless fun. Apparently I'm supposed to be answering student queries even though there aren't any there till September. I'm suspicious already.

      1. I have 33 minutes to write today's journal. I haven't even thought about what I think about today. All I know is that I smell and the woman next to me in the library is shrinking away to be sick.  2. I spent the night on a sofa in the middle of nowhere and was woken by a small child beating me over the head with a toilet roll.  3. 31 minutes to go and fuck me there are some pretentious people buzzing about. Better not start annoying me...I can see that a showdown will be inevitable.  4. My sister could be going to India in 3 weeks I'd love to go with her but she'll probably be in a compound anyway.  5. 26 Minutes and you wouldn't think this was a library. It's more like a gossip trading community centre. Has someone just sparked up...christ.  6. Bread makers. Pure genius. We made some this morning and it was lovely to wake up to fresh bread. Once you get over all the bourgeois lumps it was quite easy to swallow.  7. I have been selected for International Wife Swap. More details when I have them.  8. 15 Minutes to go. How ironic! The thought of being on television sickens and intrigues me.  9. My journal is the only thing that I will be submitting to this site for the foreseeable future.  10. The Incredible Zac has been back to the dog doctor. She insists that it is his dew claw that is the problem. She did say that we could try and remove it ourselves. I would but I don't have a suit of armour.

      1. I agree with Francis Fukuyama. History is dead and never more so. If nothing what it seems at the time, how can it be remembered? If politicians will not concede current truths or realities, how can our children learn about past mistakes? That said. My old history teacher Mr Dunstan once asked the perenial question "What has anyone ever learnt from history?" I racked my brain as did everyone and after a short pause he softly said "Nothing" as if to underline the pointlessness of the class on both sides. History is a measure. A measure of kills, treaties, alliances and Bills. History is a measure of science, marriages, births and deaths. History was never a lesson and today, history was five minutes ago.  2. I said I was missing the sea so I went to West Wales. We surfed all day and our muscles are now too heavy for our own bones and our skin too tight to smile. Happiness abounds alongside exhaustion. The sea was very warm btw, I recommend a splash about in the surf. Clears the head and is far cheaper than a salt scrub at a health farm. I feel like a red raw rabbit.  3. It looks like I've pulled it off again and found another job that allows me to get paid for writing. B.O.N.U.S.  4. Sadly my Grandad, Ralph's marbles appear to be spilling uncontrollably out of their small bag and towards the gutter as we look on in desperation. He is 90 something as his my grandmother Nellie (they've been married since pre-history). Who would have thought it would have ended so shabbily?  5. When did watching Englishmen playing sport on television become so tiresome and unenjoyable? We expect so much when frankly the truth is that the British are the worst kind of sportsmen, part timers. It's certainly possible that the public expects so much simply because their own lifestyles are filled with inactivity and a lack of ambition. I expect nothing and am mildly pleased when we do well.  6. The mother of my Godson has a heart murmur. Is that serious? I don't know...  7. Lies can be so much fun but it mystifies me why true liars don't get tired of them sooner?  8. Have been reading the collected works of R.L.Thomas. Going back to a previous thread, I certainly understand a good deal more poetry now that I'm older. Perhaps it's because I want to.  9. Is this a traditionally quiet time on UKA? I guess it is. This is really my first fully online summer. OMG that's the saddest thing I've ever written.  10. mmm...Glastonbury looked very poor indeed, glad I went surfing. It took Jeff 8.5 hours to get back!! He was only coming back to South Wales.

      1. Not sure if you listened to radio one this morning but last night's referee has a website with a feedback section. I'm sure you will all want to give him some honest feedback. Also I noticed that when you submit your feedback, a page comes up with his signature on it...Any fraudsters out there?  2. Strangely I feel better for being knocked out. The tension is gone. I'm thinking about normal things like planning a holiday, getting a new job, finally taking my dog out. Bless him, he was pacing about at 5am this morning so I had to go and let the boy out. I think he's a bit backed up.  3. GREAT NEWS: I have won the Ribena Donkey. They said that I am it's owner although they have said that they would like it to remain in the sanctuary but they have no grounds for making it so. What the hell am I going to with it?  4. Strangely my mate Damien has just called about the football. I told him about the donkey, he went nuts although this is right up his alley. He's off to ring his people.  5. I have already named my donkey. He will be called Emile.  6. I have just got off the phone with Damien who thinks he can get enough formaldehyde for the weekend. Damien says this donkey thing is an amazing piece of luck. I agree the irony and the timing are exceptional.  7. Damien has just phoned me back. He's decided to paint a George Cross on it's back; Ironic in itself and have it dissected through all the axis of the cross. We must move quickly though.  8. Ribena seemed a bit nervous when I asked them where the nearest abbatoir to the sanctuary was. "Are you going to kill the donkey?" were their precise words.   "I think you did that when you put an animal up for auction." Was mine. "Besides Emile will be immortalised."  9.5 The lawyers are involved. Damien says fuck the lawyers, although Damien says fuck to alot of things.  10. Ribena have called. The news is not good. They say that the keeper of the Emile is threatening to poison it rather than let Damien have it. Apparently he's very anti modern art and has even entered the Not The Turner Prize competition with a chintzy painting of the donkey in question!! We have a stand off and it doesn't look good for the donkey.  10.2 Damien has been in contact with Ribena. Apparently the donkey promotion thing is some tie in to the Shrek 2 movie. The producers aren't happy but have pointed out that in the movie the donkey turns into a white horse. I think Damien's mind is in overdrive. He told me that he's told Ribena in no uncertain terms that "Either way, something with four legs is gonna die today." I think he's upset about the football. He keeps going on about the artist as the ultimate referee.   10.36521. They have offered us tickets to the Premiere of Shrek 2 in London next week. Apparently we are sitting next to Eddie Murphy but only if we drop this donkey thing. Damien has agreed since we both love Trading Places although he did point out that he's gonna punch Mike Myers in the face if he gets the chance and who can blame him?  10.53f/rtw  I have decided to donate Emile to a French children's charity. Imagine the fun they can have riding him into the ground.

      1. Blummineck, I'm knackered. Didn't get in till 2.30 this morning from the Chili Peppers who were, btw, rather disappointing. Our seats were in the top tier of the Millenium Stadium and were miles away. Bugger that we thought so we found a service elevator and got down onto the corporate box level...  2.  I'm hungry like a leathery hippo  I could eat a scabby cat  If I don't get something in my belly soon  I will pass out under the weight of my own light head  3. My computer is D.E.A.D. dead. I will sue God although I suspect that his counter claim is likely to be more successful.  4. I can't really see this happening in the House of Lords http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1245929,00.html  5. The pressure to surf is mounting. I can smell the salty swell and feel that gritty rubber round me arse, the crabs nipping at me toes and the ocean in my stomach. I've just talked myself into it.  6. I can tell today is going to be a slow one. Even the clocks can't be bothered.  7. It's amazing to see so many people in one place, ie 60,000 people. I'm amazed that when armed with the tools to speak to so many people, they say nothing.  8. So no job offers then? One of you must be a multi millionaire businessman with too much time on your hands just looking for someone to look after your winter retreat in Antigua?  9. There's a woman in our office who, it seems hates her husband beyond measure. I think she blames him for supplying her with sick children.  10. In the middle of christ knows how many people last night I bumped into a friend who I hadn't seen for 3 years. I thought she still lived in Northampton but she's moved back to Bristol. It was weird considering all the things people have told me about her departure. Her young brother died in a car crash a few years ago and it's had a profound effect on her. I like reckless people but that's probably the sad punk in me.

      1. I had a dream about a Finnish girl in my office last night. We were in a bedroom in darkness. She then took me on a tour of Toronto at night. We went to a cafe run by some crazy friends who were just pretending to run it. When it was time to leave she said that she was going to say and that I would have to find my own way back. I asked if she had a key, she said that she usually just broke in somehow. I'm not sure how it ended but I liked her tatoo, but there again things are fairly weird at the moment.  2. I've never known a job where people are so pathetic. I've been out sick for two days and you'd think there was a bomb I'd forgotten to defuse before I left. How many more times do I have to remind these fools?  3. I haven't had a cold for 4 years. I start work and hey presto. Living proof that work kills people. Don't start.  4. Why the fuss? Croatia are no better than say Portsmuff. Good goals vo.  5. Off to see the Chilli Peppers in Cardiff tomorrow night. Not sure if I'm looking forward to it or not. I am looking forward to seeing the new stadium. Can't believe I haven't been there yet. Mind you I've never been in Chepstow Castle.  6. DISASTER. Yesterday I was on my PC at home playing CIV3 I think when...BANG. A huge lightning strike above the house. I nearly had kittens. My motherboard is fried. Would this be covered by house insurance? This happen to anyone else? My guess is that lightning hit a transformer and surged on the power.  7. Traction saturday went well. 5 tonnes of stone in five hours. Not bad for 4 of us. This patio better be worth it. Phrase of the day. That guitar reminds me of everything I hate about Gomez.  8. Low counts on Friday for reads yes? Shameless self promotion warning. Did everyone miss my poem? Here it is http://www.ukauthors.com/article7040.html  9. Ian Wright, Schoolboy extraordinaire actually made up a great word on live TV last night. Foom. I took it to mean fucking marvellous.  10. This reminds me of a word we made up some time ago. Spashion. A heady mix of sports and fashion. We also have recently come up with a similar but different word. Spassion. A passion for sports. I'm calling David Bowie later.

      1. I played an entire round of golf in my dream last night. I have no idea what I shot. I'm actually quite good at golf (my handicap was 10) but I refuse to play anymore. I just can't stand all the associations it has. What drags me in everytime is the velvet curves of the green. I think golf courses are beautiful things to look at and be on, I just wish they had a greater purpose. I wonder if there is a link between golf course design and classical concepts of Elysium and Arcadia?  2. My friend wants me to go surfing on Saturday. Mmmm. 20mm of rain with a 20mph NEasterly. Thanks but no thanks. Where's my sense of adventure? I believe it may be just outside a pub in Hotwells.  3. How I laughed when Italy scored the winner and then realised that they had been knocked out. Fresh schadenfreude.  4. My uncle is retiring this year. He's worked for a Mercedes dealer for years in Southampton. They've only gone and got him some tickets for the Euro 2004 Final. How nice, lets hope England get there.  5. I need a new job. My contract is at an end and all they've offered me is a six week contract in the purchasing office. I asked them if they hadn't got anything that involved pumping formaldehyde through my veins. It might have been more lively.  6. Should I post my CV on UKA? One of you motley lot could find me a job I will enjoy surely?  7. Jobs I can't do.      Fireman - I'm hunky and good looking but can't stand trauma.       Undertaker - See above       Scientist - Check my posts       Professional footballer - Not thick enough       Corporate Whore - I feel so used!   8. Jobs I can do.      Submarine washer - I remember reading that in the Beano as a kid, one of Dennis the Menace's dream jobs      Kitchen fitter - Martin hasn't complained...yet      Project manager - Lots of people complained when I did that mind you.      Data Analyst - You don't know the trouble I seen.      Football Pundit - My armchair is so comfy.      Games Reviewer - Send me your wares!!   9. Hmmm...dilemma. Should I take a radio with me to the Chilli Peppers tonight so I can listen to the football?  10. Look out for some Haute Couture Haiku...

      1. I have successfully evaded the flu. My mum has been coughing like a sealion on 20 JPS a day and I was more than a little worried that the mild sore throat I was enduring would go postal. No such fear. My three year record remains intact. No illness, no injury. What with falling down the cellar twice, I am coming to the conclusion that I am unbreakable like Bruce Willis but with more hair and less chicks.  2. We were talking about fostering children last night. Apparently it has become alot easier to do so. A friend of a friend who is a single mum has been fostering a little girl for about a year now and is about to adopt her. My sister tells me that even single men have been given licence to adopt with greater ease these days. My mother said that perhaps she should foster. I said that it was a somewhat trickier than looking after next door's dog. Do you know, in a way I can imagine it might be more fulfilling taking care of a child or children that weren't yours.  3. You'll be pleased to hear that my anger has subsided but I am troubled by the attitude of the British press. Yes there has been some trouble in the Algarve but not much by all accounts. It was expected, it was dealt with, it's the same trouble we see on our own streets every weekend. I do not condone any violence unless directed towards Mr G.W.Bush of Texas. But is it really in anyone's interests for the British media to search out and more than likely stir up trouble? It's gonna be great if our own media get us kicked out of a tournament just so they can sell some newspapers or get some higher ratings. What happened to the great British cover up???  4. I'm not sure I'm gonna manage 35,000 words in ten weeks. Mind you that's only 3500 a week, 500 a day maybe a 1000 on sunday. Has anyone got a work ethic kit I can borrow?  5. Second part of that program on swingers last night. Why do people think it's a good idea? I've seen the destruction left by such arrangements and it's not nice. Humans are not emotionally designed for multiple and simultaneous excursions.  6. Jeeeeeez. I just had a self inflating academic screaming at me about broken lock. I just stared him down. He was banging on about the wasted time he'd spent trying to get his key out of a lock. I pointed out that he was a University lecturer and it was the summer. Case dismissed.  7. Sooz, at what point did you think keeping polecats was good idea? If you want to amuse a child buy a puppy. They can then grow up together, be the best of pals and the kid can learn the much needed lessons of life when he eventually has to take the old boy down the barn and put him out of his misery. But a polecat? That's just a recipe for losing fingers. The way I see it, if you're an animal lover, which I am, there will be far less moral dilemmas to make if you have a dog than if you have a polecat. What part of your body would the polecat need to have it's teeth sunk into before you clubbed it to death with a La Creuset lasagne dish?  Polecat rant over.  8. I just said to someone in my office that they could berate someone on my behalf since they were far better at condescension than myself...  9. I hate Xmas but I wish it was Xmas already. I hate Xmas day but I like the Xmassy feeling in the pubs and the shops. There is always an optimism at Xmas but in summer it's just oppression. I should just go and live in Greenland I guess.  10. I'm in Brighton on the weekend of 9th July on a stag doo. The last one I went on was a few years ago in Bournemouth. That ended in a massive food fight in a curry house but we are older and wiser now :~{ honest guv.

      1. This is quite sad to say but I'm really getting into Big Brother. Why? It does get the balance right between contrived and real. So many reality TV shows go too far one way or the other. It's just entertainment like everything else folks. What's going on with that Stuart fella btw. He's beginning to dress v.strangely.  2. I have the munchies this morning. That Thai-Hawaiian cocktail packs a punch. I thought walking was funniest thing ever last night and I smelt all the roses on the way home to find the sweetest one. If I had been watching me I'd have called the police.  3. We were watching a program last night. It was like a magazine program. One chap had lost his wife, another woman was getting her legs measured, all very confusing. It was only when we saw the woman walking down the street, we realised it was a program about really tall people. I had a 'liaison' with a South African giant nurse the other year. She was about 6'3", I'm 5'9". I swear she had hands like shovels. I was reminded of when Gulliver travels to Brobdingnag and that giant nipple.  4. I do love Gulliver's Travels. You can read it here if you like. http://www.online-literature.com/swift/gulliver/  5. Traction saturday approaches with all the good will of a vengeance demon.  6. I wish you could just delete a verbal argument like that. You could literally take everything back that you said.  7. I've never really got to grips with whom am I when I am online. Online personalities are different to real ones. In text I can be overbearing, harsh, opinionated, random and pyschopathic. But in reality...I'm really quite...the same.  8. Swear too much? I know I do. I'm going to start some of these words instead.  http://www3.sympatico.ca/brooksdr/haddock/main.htm/   My favourite is Slubberdegullions!  9. Watched Imagine last night on John Coltrane who gets added to my genius list forthwith. I had no idea that A Love Supreme matches up note for note with the poem that went alongside it. Amazing man. The programme on Hopper last week was also good.  10. There are lots and lots of great things on the Interweb. In no particular order, here are some of my favourites.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page http://www.heavy.com/  fat connection required http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/> http://www.eyestorm.com/  Oh and try and spot the fake answer  http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-18851,00.html

      1. Well they offered me a place on this course which is good and I have two weeks to decide whether to do it. We shall shee.  2. Fell down Mart's cellar again (2 times this year). I know have a large graze on my arm and only 5 lives left. It's a damn good job I don't have a motorbike or participate in any dangerous sports or else I'd be one dead dogfrog.  3. Haven't yet got Euro 2004 fever. I think it's something to do with the fact that we have the most boring side since every Spurs side ever. There's a picture of Paul Scholes on the back of the Times today having a dump.  4. My death will accomplish nothing, I'm gonna put it off for a bit.  5. It's quite sickening how the women in my office fawn like Japanese school girls over the Dean. They were literally queuing up to make him a cup of tea earlier. Either they know something I don't or he's got some group psychosis thing going.  6. I've mentally chosen a group of utterly random words. For should a time come when I bump into Derren Brown, I will be prepared.  7. Topless mud wrestling on BB. They've spoilt it now. Two weeks in and there's nothing left to the imagination, not that I was watching, honest guv. Do you have Big Brother in Egypt Nancy?  8. Compulsory voting and a national holiday. I think that is the way forward. Freedom is too important to be left up to other people. In actual fact in countries that have extremely low turnouts in their elections should be automatically taken over by the UN until they can prove that they have taken an interest in politics!!  9. I was just thinking about how introducing ID cards in the UK will affect the Internet. I wonder how many sites would consider using the ID card number as security measure. (ie for logging into chat,forums etc) How secret and personal would that number be? Ooh that's all a bit dull for a friday. Forget that and think about Rooney's weekend goal bonanza instead.  10. I was also just thinking about the band that have most influenced or affected my life. Sadly and like everyone else of my age and exquisite taste I think it's The Smiths.  11. This amp is louder.  It goes up to eleven!

      1. So you are determined to rediscover the poet inside  2. No not like that, you filthy mongrel.  3. You are not serious enough to be a proper poet.  4. I give thought to the bigger things.  5. But it's about the little things these days, the detail. Old poets wrote about the bigger things because we didn't understand them.  6. Agreed but the world could be made to spin the other way if we all turned in the same direction and continued our small talk. Celebrity gossip is the new noise pollution.  7. I hope your insight extends further than that.  8. But that's the great thing about being a poet. You can mean what you like, it's all interpretation. Style over content.  9. Money for old rope.  10. Somethings never change.

      1. Weird dreams. I dreamt that I had a physics O'level exam today. I was saying, "I've already got a Physics O'level, I'm not going to do any better this time. Look no revision." My mother was saying, "You don't know that."  2. Had a conversation with a robotics lecturer who had brought round a leaflet called "Welcome to the Robot Revolution." I was wondering whether his death would prevent the rise of the machines but decided probably not after we got talking. His leaflet said that he wanted artists, writers and scientists for his course. He said that he could teach the maths to anyone because he had robots providing the excitement. I disagreed. You cannot teach just anyone complex maths. My brain turns to pate when I try and I don't know why.  3. I have my interview this afternoon. I put three books in my bag, Shampoo Planet by Douglas Copeland, Cocaine Nights by J.G.Ballard and Reefer Madness by Eris Schlosser. Hmmm...that says smackhead.  4. I have worked out an ending for the Turf War which I shall write this morning. That'll mean I have written the beginning, some middle and the end. Just need to fill in the gaps now eh? If only it were that easy.  5. Haven't heard much Scissor Sisters but every track I have heard is spankingly good. I feel a purchase coming on. The track I heard reminds me of Moby.  6. The desire for chocolate is strong today. I can feel it's dark magnet of the vending machine sucking me in.  7. Had some very mad thoughts last night indeed. For instance. Perhaps a solution to global warming (which they're now saying is nothing we have anything to do with) could be to genetically modify trees so they grow to enormous sizes very quickly. Then we could live in them too like Ewoks! Shortly after I was thinking about how everything comes down to binary but let's not go there.  8. I have given in to my evil Lord. I am now Double Deckered up!!  9. People who whisper in offices really get my goat! If you want to keep secrets then email each other!!  While I'm on the subject, there is a woman in my office who speaks to me amongst others as if she's still talking to her kids. I have never met an adult who tells people to shut up and stop talking.  I just tore into her.  10. Have you heard the new Streets song? If that's not poetry I don't know what is.

      1. Have this interview thingy at the University tomorrow for the Creative writing course. I have in fact been thinking about teaching it in the long term. It would seem I'm quite good at talking bollocks, so I figure why not get paid for it?  2. Zac the Incredible has ripped his dewclaw, not twisted his joint as was previously thought. I am coming to the conclusion that he is one hell of an actor either way.  3. On another dog related note, apparently I have started shouting at the dog in my sleep. I don't shout at the dog when I'm awake and have no real urge to, so that is baffling.  4. It's my old mum's birthday today. I bought her a bench for the patio. I was gonna get a plaque engraved for it saying something like Gillian Anne B____ 1943 - Present   I guess she wouldn't have found that funny.  5. Expect stomach ache when you don't eat fruit for ages and then binge like a hungry gorilla for an afternoon.  6. Saints have signed a new left back from Ajax, Jelle Van Damme for 2.5m . Excellent, he's 6'4 and a complete mentalist. Plus what a fantastic name.  7. There is no seven today.  8. I'm glad that the heat has retreated back over the hill. Normally I don't mind but when it creeps up on you like that...  9. There's a woman here at work who wears a 101 Dalmations blouse. WTF. She has a dog on each breast...um...hideous.  10. Someone just came in the office looking for the Dean. A woman in the office shouted, "He's in the disabled toilet." Still at least you only get one chance to make a first impression. Thank you Mr Brent.

      1. Left the house and got five miles before I realised I had no gas and no means of payment, had to go back. Blur were right, modern life is rubbish. In older times I could have bartered for petrol, in most decent countries you still can.  2. It's nice to see a smiling face in the morning especially when it's yours.  3. My dog, the incredible Zac hurt himself last night. We have laminate floors in the kitchen. He slipped and appears to have hurt his foot but no serious damage methinks. I have just been recommended Paw Wax which stops them slipping. Cool.  4. Mum's birthday tomorrow. Ideas for presents please. Something for the garden possibly? Garden heaters are the next climate killer  5. Policy decision. I am switching from strong European lager to real ale.  6.It's official. When you're in love with a beautiful woman...it's hard.  7. I am fully expecting England to be destroyed in the forthcoming European Championships. My tip is obviously Latvia.  8. New made up word learnt last night...shaboodle from shebang and caboodle. I'll let you deal with the finer intracies of meaning. Best example wins another go.  9. I like the way Monster Munch stay with you for about an hour giving your tongue a good work out. Nothing like a healthy breakfast is there?  10. I wish I was standing in the European elections on thursday. I fear I may have left it too late. Being an MEP sounds like a bit of a earner and besides Belgium is not a bad office to work in. Mmmmm...truffles.

      1.  Dogfrog's real name is a perfectly good one.  There are 42 people in the UK with his name.  He has never met any of them but suspects that he will bludgeon their thin skulls with a toffee hammer if he does.  2.  Dogfrog's blogs are simple 10 point entries but don't let this fool you.  3.  Dogfrog has been know to lie.  4.  You can mail Dogfrog and if you need a lie he'll come up with something suitable elaborate.  5.  Dogfrog is a Southampton FC supporter.  He will not be drawn into protracted disputes with Portsmuff devotees.  6.  Dogfrog lives in the corner of a forest on a border with an unfashionable principality.  7.  Dogfrog is a writer and occassional poet.  You can find links to some of his work on this site.  8.  Dogfrog does "work" but only so that he can write.  This means he doesn't get paid alot so anyone who requires a paid house-sitter for their dojo in Martinique get in touch immediately.  9.  Dogfrog believes that you can prove anything with facts, regardless of where you get them from or whether they are right or not.  10. As you can see Dogfrog created this some time ago and has been miserably shite at maintaining it.  Dogfrog has however been keeping his journal at   and he is now in the process of moving that journal to the DogFrogBlog.  Enjoy the shameless ramblings and inane lies that spew forth from Dogfrog's petulant fingers and see if you can spot what is true and what is optional.

      1.	I'm going to republish my UKA thread question here because it yielded such interesting results.  Here it is.  I'm not sure whether my "online personality" is so much different from my non-online one, only my good friends might be able to answer, but what I do know is the opportunities for mischief and being outspoken are far greater than in the outside world (and I'm like a kid in a sweetshop)  How is your "online personality" different from your other one? Do you think that they merge over time? Do you think that your actual personality has changed as a result of your online version?  Quite simply lying about who you are and what you do has never been easier. Perhaps it's always been easy if you are brash and bold enough (credit card fraudsters do it everyday).  Truth and lies are increasing fluid in the modern age. The development of the Interweb in particular has fuelled urban legends and spoofing to new levels. There was in fact a conference in Aberystwyth yesterday on urban legends. Is the lack of user’s identity and therefore authority what gives the Interweb such a chaotic reputation?  I'm not making a moral judgement about truth, telling lies or who you are when you are online, I'd just like your thoughts not just on the blurring of reality online but how this is creeping into our lives generally.  Mail me and tell me your thoughts by clicking the big mail me link at the top of the page.   2.  I admit it. The above thread is part of some research I'm doing for a story called The Stereotypist.  It's about a man who makes generalisations about everyone he meets on and offline.  I suspect there will be a sticky end for him.  The difficulty I have is that in expressing the opinions of the man with regard to the people he meets, might be interpreted as mine.  They're honestly not although they could be seen as such.  The man in real life makes disastrous assumptions about the people he meets.  Online he makes equally disastrous assumptions about people based on their usernames and the info he can glean from profiles.  This is the bit people could be offended by.  Oooh controversial.  3.  Bovril salad dressing.  I am emailing them right now.  4.  Overheard word of the day  - Affordance.  A visual clue to the function of an object.  Affordancy is a jazz topic.  It's a subject found in psychology and education amongst other things.  It can apply to learning, design, ergonomics, the list goes on.  As I say pure jazz.  5.	Hey this is fantastic although I’m not sure for what reasons  urlLink Wind Farm Madness   6.	Picking up the pieces on Channel 4 last night was good stuff.  Robert Brown served 25 years in prisoner for the murder of Annie Walsh.  The court of appeal freed him because it emerged that a bent copper Jack Butler, beat the confession out of him.  Brown’s mother was dying of cancer on his release and died 18months later.  He was enormously attached to her.  Robert was right when he said that no-one could ever empathise or understand what he’d been through unless you’d been through the same thing (presumably why he hooked up with Paddy Hill).  Twenty five years ago was a different world but these things can still happen (I believe there could many MOJO’s, miscarriages of justice, due to an overconfidence in forensic evidence for instance).  What surprised me about the program was how strong a personality Robert had and why having such charisma he managed to stay inside so long?  7.	Let’s take the money out of the game.  Year 1 for the Premiership.  There should be a maximum amount of money that a player can earn whilst he’s playing.  All players should be valued equally.  All players to see out their contracts and clubs to honour their end and put on dreadful testimonials.  Give the players enough cash for a mock tudor mansion, a rubbish sports car, a curly perm as well as free tickets to their local Ritzy’s Neetclub.  Second thoughts I’d take £9million for Beattie.  8.	I’m seriously thinking of blowing out the Saints game against Swindon and going to the UKA live event now.  That thread has made everything a whole lot more interesting somehow.  9.	Thanks to Justin for making me piss myself laughing this morning with  urlLink This  Turn it up.  10.	These copy protected CD’s are a pain in the arse.  If you are at work and you don’t have admin access then you can’t install the software they have on them.  I was looking forward to listening to the new Zero7 album today and now I’m just gonna have to settle for WUMB country suicides on the radio.  Sort it out music industry.

      1.  I seem to have developed a healthy work ethic today.  Not sure where this has come from.   I think I must be a confidence programmer, like your get confidence footballers.  If I come in and make a good start it inspires me to code all day.  2.  Apparently surfs up again soon. I'm fancying a change of location, maybe Croyd or Saunton Sands.  Aubrey Strawberry Sausage wants to come which is amazing because neither myself or Stimmer can remember the last time he did some exercise.  There was the time he was running down Cotham Hill away from a group of people trying to beat him up and that group of people was us.  Stimmer pointed out that curling up like a ball on the pavement was technically exercise.  3.  Since I need to replace my frazzled PC I'm wondering what to get and where to get it from.  Obviously I'm not going to do anything a stupid as getting one at PCTurd, so I'm wondering whether it's good value to either get one on QXL or from our local PC shop where I could get one built.  The insurance paid out 440 squid for the box and I suppose it's possible to get a laptop and a box on QXL, auction permitting.  Oh I don't know it's like choosing a holiday on teletext.  4.  I was so far off the Myers-Briggs tests when I worked for the Man that even the person setting the test said "Why and how do they let you work here?"  My fate was sealed early when she had us line up in a car park as a physical comparison of each other.  I ended up in the next car park. They had to phone me to let me know they'd finished.  5.  I have rubbish hair at the moment.  I'm growing it but I have no idea into what style, shaggy dog more than likely.  I'm coming to the conclusion that my "shave it, grow it, shave it, grow it" approach to hairdressing is a bit too agricultural.  I better get it cut if I'm gonna crack America.  6.  I have discovered BBC Radio 6, well a few nice parts of it.  Shamelessly succumbing to the TV adverts starring Phill Jupitus I tuned in on the Interweb and was more than pleasantly surprised.  Whilst many of you will be music fans and some more of you will be music nuts, it occurred to me last night that the British don't like music at all really.  It causes squelchy feelings and makes people want to lose control which freaks us out entirely (unless you're at a wedding).  Our best exports are based on simple music, the Beatles to name one example and I just don't think we deal with complex music that well.  Goto to any local salsa class for living proof of this.  7.   urlLink A living legend, Sid Waddell   8.  Apparently sunflower seeds are excellent in shepherd's pie. WLYK.  9.  I can't think of any better job than a radio DJ who works at home.  How do you start a radio station?  I'll find out.  I can see it now...Wye Valley FM.  I could tell the local community where the freshest eggs are to had each morning and where the coolest coffee mornings are.  I'm thinking The Archers meets Radio 1.  Gap in the market, make a killing.   10.  Will the last soldier left in the country reboot the server please?

      1.  Did I ever tell you I used to be in a band?  urlLink  Koopa    2.  My mother is so scared of catching MRSA that she is not going ahead with her foot operation.  She doesn't want to lose her legs like Lesley Ash which is understandable.  Get a new set of lips and lose your legs, it's the price you pay.  I have the same attitude with the hangover pill.   Don't you just know we're all gonna pay somewhere down the line?  3.  Weird dream.  I joined the army and got on the bus where they threatened a particularly nasty initiation process.  They didn't scare me.  When we arrived at the barracks and claimed my bed all my school mates turned up having joined the army too.  When I asked why they pointed at the PC's behind the beds.  We could spend all night playing army designed first person shooter games free all night.  Cool I said but... Don't you just know we're all gonna pay somewhere down the line?  4. Finished my new short story Full Circle last night.  More pleased with it than Acceptance which when I read it back seemed trite.  5. I have converted to the tabloid Independent from the Grauniad (only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays) because I don't like just throwing away those huge Education and Society supplements.  They should make them optional.  It'll be better when the Grauniad reformats next year I guess.  6.  I have submitted my thoughts on crime to the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.( They asked for it)  The main thrust of what I said stated that I did not believe that their involvement with reality TV programmes, particularly city centre, fighting and drinking type crime was a good thing from a PR perspective.  It's a distorted vision of what happens as they jump from one incident to another.  The value such programmes promote is social control but in fact I think that more people are scared by what they see.  I also told them that people don't want to see traffic cops stealing our cash, we hate that.  7.  I'm gonna bunk off early today, no doubt about it.  Time for a top three.  Top three maize snacks  1.  Monster Munch Flaming Hot 2.  Space Raiders 3.  Salt and Vinegar Chipsticks  Get that lot stuck round your teeth.  Or visit one of the greatest Interweb sites ever.   Snackspot     8. See I've gone and committed myself to ten points a day.  Which if I were at Weight Watchers would be too little but here I'm wondering if it's too much. No I forgot it's not I was going rename the Blog, Ten Points A Night, which is quite clever if you say it with an Irish accent.  Blown Away, I'm not going over that again.  I sat down thinking it was Arlington whatever it's called, forgetting it's a totally different film.  The news is so dull lately that my brain has been dried like a herring with a hairdryer.  Something happen for fucks sake!!  9.  I suppose in lieue of any interesting news, I'll tell you about my spat with Jimmy Krankie before she died. After seeing her on TV one night, I got her email address from her agent and I emailed her saying that wasn't it time she gave up prentending to be a young schoolboy since she was now almost 75.  Basically she told me where to get off, who did I think I was etc.  She had a point.  She was perfectly entitled to live out her sick fantasy in any manner she chose fit.  Just to prove that she was just as lively and mischevious as any schoolboy, she sent a few photographs of herself catapulting marbles through some windows of an Ayrshire Building Society.  I couldn't fault her energy or target, they;d turned me down for a mortgage based on the fact that I once had scurvy.  Her husband Ian mailed me a few days later to explain that Jimmy had been arrested and bailed to appear at the magistrates court later that day for the incident. The custody saergant checked on her at 11 am, he found Jimmy hanging by a spare school tie, she always kept in her sock.  I guess it had become more than a panto, more than just kids entertainment.  A note was found scribbled in an old exercise book under her imaginary geography homework.  It simply said...  10.  Don't you just know we're all gonna pay somewhere down the line?

       1. One person fails to look in their mirror and dies. Result 6 hours of chaos on the M48 and M4. We should just clock it up to experience. It's taken me 3 hours to get to work, normally it takes 15 minutes and now my feet smell under my desk. It is a nice day though and I had an hour to take in the views from the new Severn Bridge and have a chat with Annie who hated diving.     2. It does make me wonder what will happen to my little town when they shut the old Severn Bridge. It will happen in time. I give it 15 years. They wont build a new one that's for sure. What happens to a bridge no-one wants anyway?     3. Sven and Nancy are to have a trial separation. Durrr. So what that is essentially saying is that we are going to see if we like our lives better without each other. Of course you will you muppets. Sven's apparently got his pick of ageing supermodels and he's unlikely to think mmm...dis is dreadful, I sink I'll go back to 4-4-2. She should just say, "Sven, look you cock roaming sonafabitch, it's over. Expect the tiny size of your manhood to be printed in the News of the World this Sunday."     4. Fantastic, those BNP cnuts from that documentary have been arrested. I'd like to think they'll be reaching for the soap but I suspect in prison they'll be lauded as heroes. Tell me I'm wrong.     5. I strongly urge you to visit the Disasters Emergency Commitee website and donate to the Sudan emergency.   &nbsp; http://www.dec.org.uk/    &nbsp;Amnesty and Human Rights Watch say that they now have direct evidence that the Sudanese government is complicit in supplying arms and funds to the people carrying out these atrocities. From the site: "Refugees are sleeping in the open, they are running out of food and drinking water is scarce. While floodwaters from recent rains are washing human and animal waste into water sources raising fears of outbreaks of disease such as cholera and diarrhoea. For people, particularly children, already suffering from malnutrition and dehydration these diseases can kill. "     And from the  Independent  If we invaded Sudan nobody would mind and we could do some serious good. Why do we keep worrying about theoretical power plays?     6.  A truly magnificent instrument . I own several.     7. I've begun to read Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin. Reasonably impressed so far but as someone pointed out to me, there is not alot of dialogue. This is fine by me. There's not alot in my work even though people say it's what I'm best at. People generally talk shite most of the time anyway, I know I do.     8.  Steve Bell  is a fantastic cartoonist. Nobody draws bush and blair better.     9. Pop quiz. What is the easiest event to become an Olympic competitor in? I've always wondered that. Seriously if I started training next week so that I had a chance to go to the next Olympics, what event should I choose to maximise my chances of going?    10. Last night I wrote the second part to a short story called Full Circle. The annoying thing was that it became so sodding predictable as I was writing it. I hate that and I think that's why people write in twists at the end of shorts because for the most part all of our stories have been told. I will revisit the style for there lies the answer.     Now, where did I put Nancy's phone number...

      1. I need a massage. I bruised my cocsix(?) when bounding up and down on the power boat last weekend.  2. I'm writing a short story called Acceptance. It's about Hollywood which is a strange thing for me to write about since I have more interest in vegetables. The story was partly inspired watching a programme about adults with learning difficulties going round Britain on a double-decker bus. It was on the same night as the Oscars which in contrast was repellent. Recently I went to see Adam Hills, an Australian comic who reveals some interesting things about Big Red Fire Engines. It came together like cheese and chutney.  3. On a movie note, I-Robot looks a bit of a hoot and it reminds me that I like the kind of science fiction that is only slightly in the future. I-Robot seems to be interesting in it's social setup. Robots do all the work that humans don't like doing, walking the dog, refuse collection, in fact all the work the west pays its poor underclass to do. Once all those jobs go, presumably they'll either get jobs pretending to be robots or they'll just starve to death I guess. http://www.irobotmovie.com/  Is this the first Asimov book turned film? No I just answered my own question, Bicentennial Man with Robin Williams was based on Asimov.  4. Thank you Chepstow council for deciding to have a firework display at 10:45pm last night. Well thought through you pricks. I have done my worst and written to the Chepstow Free Press, our local rag. Now that I have discovered I can do this online, they shall be plagued like the dogs they are. I can feel a surge of bile rising for the man on a bidet issue.  5. I've been thinking about ASBO's (Anti-social behaviour orders). It's such a British response to the problem. Behaviour is undoubtedly linked to environments and if you leave kids in shitholes they'll kick even more shit out of them and each other. Give them environments they respect and the mule will follow. Full marks to the designers of the Kingsdale school in Dulwich. Speaks for itself really. See the Guardian G2 today centre spread.  6. Today I'm listening to country music on WUMB which might I add is a great name for a radio station. I do wish there was more quality local radio in the UK playing music. I like the idea of driving into a town, somewhere you've never been, turning on the radio and hearing a mighty welcome to ...Hungerford. Radio, another stuffy British regulation ridden bag'o'shite.  7. Saints are playing Swindon on the 7th August in a pre-season friendly, so I will be taking a trip to see the Magic Roundabout, so that unfortunately blows out any trip to UKA live, sorry.  8. I have resolved to walk the Incredible Zac further than I have of late. His dew claw seems to be giving him less trouble than it was and when he doesn't go on long walks he gets depressed.  9. Wow, the Forest of Dean hits Channel 4 news and the Guardian. Why? Sheep shit. After foot and mouth when they butchered about 3000 wild sheep, the Sheepbadgers went and bought a load more but neglected to teach them the green cross code and trampling people's gardens. Blistering stuff eh? What, did you think a story about the Forest of Dean would not be about sheep?  10. This country music is getting me down. Three hours and I want to self-lobotomise.

      1.  First and by no means last, this came in late yesterday from Sue McGoo.   urlLink Lemmings     2.  Is it just me or is John Kerry's language sloppy?  I don't mean the content, I'm talking about the detail.    "I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war."  I think he should be talking about  you  rather than  us   I also think the tone is weak.  "As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war."  There is no self fulfulling element in his language, he has to try and make it up. "Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in? I'm not making this up. I was born in the West Wing!"  Generally there was alot of I, me and us rather than you and yours in the speech and I guess this is because he is trying to market himself harder.  A fools errand.  No matter what you think about Bush, in America he does appeal to the working man.  For all his lack of education and apparent dumbness, he does have an interesting and distinctive voice that people recognize instantly.  Clinton had that too with all his rasping.  Kelly is not going to win any personality competition so I'd say do what you can but hit him on idealogical grounds.  Sadly, I think Bush will win again because he knows how to.  3.  After 50 years of motoring hell, it's like an epiphany.   urlLink  Hallelujah   4.  Ooh, Ooh,  urlLink new Batman film  next year.  5.  Following my runnaway success in Starlight Express, I decided to audition for  urlLink Mamma-Mia   I was surprised to learn that they want me for a matinee show in Tokyo, the only one that they do in English.  I told them to stick it, its Broadway or nothing for me honey.  Mum's got other plans for me anyway I'm sure.  6.  We get our hot beverages from upstairs in the staff room, a walk of perhaps 3-4 minutes depending on the nap of the carpet.  We have noticed that when we get coffee, we spill more than if we have tea or no milky hot drinks.  I proposed that this is something to do with surface tension (viscosity), but Joe suspects that there are psychological reasons for the spillages.  Joe put forward the theory that subconsciously we desire the coffee more and we are over eager to get back to our desks and drink it, hence the spillages.  I prefer my theory it just sounds like great bad science.  7.  Has anyone got an animatronic panther they're not using?  8.  Last night in bed all I could hear was the sound of chainsaws in the forest somewhere.  This was about 1am.  We get somewhere in the region of 15 grisly murders a year in the Valley.  Either that or the kids had strapped nightvision goggles to their helmets and had gone out on their scramblers.  9.  My sister is back from India on Sunday at about 5.30 which means I should get my presents about 8.  Apparently she's got me some linen shirts.  10.   urlLink Debra   who I work with has a blog too as it turns out.

      1.  First day of the second test at Edgebaston.  Wish I was there.    I don't like cricket...I LOVE IT...  2.

A different big brother  urlLink  Margaret Hodge no less    4.  I now have an ending for my America's Wildest Police Chase story courtesy of a couple of friends.  *Typing frenzy ahoy*  I will publish here when finished.  5.  I've been getting back in spiritual harmony with my juicer.  Three oranges, a nectarine, two apricots, some natural yoghurt and some ginger is all I need for an agonising afternoon of wind and all round unpleasantness.   urlLink  Smoothie Recipes   6.

They can do what they want as retailers but if you are thinking of committing a murder in the next few weeks, months or years, please say to the police "James Patterson's books made me do it."  7. More North Korean shennanigans.  It's a good job they are so backward really or else they'd kick our asses big time since there are millions of them and they are loyal as worker ants.   urlLink  It's so unfair   Can't we give them some others back?  Who wants to defect with me?  8.  What is the technical definition of defection?  If I decided to go and live in Pyongyang is that considered defecting?  Does the fact that North Korea is considered hostile make a difference?  Can I defect to Holland for instance?  9.  Henry Blowfelt's eyesight is not what is was.  10.   urlLink  Squirrelz , he said in a high pitch Bristolian accent.

      1.  Remember if you are caught in a terrorist attack, your first duty as a British citizen is to loot.  2.  Considering that this country is supposed to be undergoing the longest period of economic growth since the Jurassic, why do I know so many people who are either being made redundant, living under the fear of it or who actually are redundant?  I still firmly believe that this country will be like a poor man's Switzerland in 20 years.  If you can't afford to live here, then you wont.  Where will we all live and work?  North Korea is my guess since it will be pretty much empty by then anyway.  3.   urlLink  KCNA - The North Korean News Agency   An amazing look back in time before people knew what they were doing on the Interweb.  Some of the propaganda is truly remarkable too.  Why not  urlLink  mail them  in the spirit of liberal democracy?  4.   urlLink  More hilarity from The Onion     5.  Song going round in my head today - Fugitive Motel by Elbow - thing is I can only remember one line.  Circular song viruses, urggh.  6.  Myself and Ben have been talking about new girl in the office when she arrives on the 7th.  I've never seen her but Ben's met her and says she's alright. He also said that he could never mix work and mutual masturbation.  I on the other hand, have been known to.  7.  I've been on the lookout for a live helicopter web cam site but with no luck so far. If you find one please let me know.  Also does anyone know a good reason why a London double decker bus would be found in the mid-west USA?  Just make up a reason, that's all I'm looking for I can't think of one.  It's for a fictional piece.  8.  By amazing co-incidence, I was looking up London bus exports and there is a company here in my small town.  Grilliant, I feel some research coming on.  urlLink  Would you Adam'n'Eve it?   9.  Lots in the news about self-harming at the moment.  Listening to a woman this morning talking about how she throws herself down the stairs was most upsetting.  I've known a few people who've done this over the years and some that continue to do so when they feel they are under extreme pressure or at massive lows.  I remember one girl once told me that she did it not because she was depressed or ill, but it took away the numb feeling of being alive. It made her feel something.  10.

      As a child I would play in the back yard much like any other child, obsessed with spades and buckets, diggers and everything I could reach in my dad's garage. I had a dog since I was a young boy. His name was Pepper and he was an old English sheepdog, the muchos hairy variety and we loved each other dearly and would play everyday. Every day at five o'clock my parents would take Pepper away and I wouldn't see him again until the next morning. Looking back I'm not sure why I didn't question where he was going or why he didn't sleep with us in the house.  Eventually I was old enough and wise enough to follow my parents as they led Pepper up the garden path to a small bungalow at the end of the cul-de-sac. I had been told never to venture down there and up to this point had obeyed my parents.   I knocked on the door. A frog went ribbit in the undergrowth. There was a brief silence and then a friendly voice. "Come in." I pushed the door and stepped into the hallway. There was no hallway just lino, it was wet. "I'm just feeding the dog, come on through." Slowly I edged up the wet lino towards the kitchen to see an old man hunched over a table. He turned his toothy grin towards me but I looked past him at Pepper. Pepper raised his head as if he recognized me. To my horror I could see the lower body and two large legs of a frog protruding from his mouth. The old man appeared to be feeding Pepper live frogs.  I screamed and remembered nothing more.  My parents explained that the old man was to ill to look after Pepper during the day and that we couldn't keep him cos Mum was allergic. I told them about Pepper's diet and they confirmed that he did have a rubber frog which he played with at home, the old man had been preparing his tea on the table.  From that day I renamed him Dogfrog and he was just as obedient under that name as he was as Pepper since that wasn't he real one either.

      1.  Woke up this morning at the zoo, naked, covered in blood with a wolf licking my face. That took some explaining to the local filth let me tell you.  2   Mobile weapons screening machines in our schools.  Spend the money on something useful like making schools nicer places to be and to learn.  How many times do I have to say it?  Environment effects behaviour.  Do you think a portable metal detector and associated security folks are going to promote anything other than fear in our schools?  Don't give into this fuckwittage.  3.  Yahoo are stealing my picks.  Well they could be.  4.  Troy was found dead in the Wye this morning.  Ray has apparently skipped town and the people who run the Alpha Course have decided to discontinue their work in our small town.  5.  I heard a monk talking about bullying on Radio 4 as I drove to "work" this morning.  Bullying is about ego and power.  I was never a bully and I was never bullied with malice (I preferred all out fighting) but I knew kids that were and it's not nice.  Lots of kids commit suicide every year because of bullying which is deplorable.  Young people are naturally competitive, young males are naturally aggressive, it's biology, what can you do?  Females bully too and I expect it's worse for reasons I can't even think of.  The monk mentioned parents putting up with bullying with a begrudging silence.  It's hard to imagine what I'd say to my kid if he or she was being continually bullied but I know that I'd find it hard not to be straight round the parent's house.  It might be hard to accept but bullying has and will always be with us because of the nature of humans and ultimately there might be an evolutionary arguement in there somewhere.  We shouldn't put chips in our kids arms and we shouldn't restrict their freedom just because we now have the statistics to prove that some kids die in unfortunate circumstances.  6.   It's all about risk.  As Jeremy Clarkson says, you have more chance of being killed by your own trousers than you do by dying in a plane crash.  How much of a risk are you therefore at of being killed by a terrorist?  The answer is of course fuck all.  Obviously if you live in downtown Sadr City your risk is higher.  Are all these emergency booklets necessary?  I'd say no.  Obviously some of us will be in densely populated areas and others will travel to places like London and Birmingham occasionally.  If one thing the last 3-4 years has taught us is that any attack will more than likely be unconventional and from an unexpected quarter.  Most enquiries after such attacks underline the sheer irreversible panic of people caught up in such attacks which are in most cases explosive rather than nuclear, biological or chemical.  Technically chemical attacks are not classified as mass destruction since the delivery is too difficult to carry out.  When similar emergency notices were issued in the late sixties/early seventies about nuclear strikes, they caused panic buying and even induced mass nuclear shelter building.  As I say it's all about risk.  I'm not gonna change my life.  By the way if I do get killed by a terrorist all I ask is that you avenge my death.  7.   urlLink Ingenious    8.  Ray just called and bizarrely admitted to burying his brother Calum under the skate park on Piggies Hill.  I didn't even know he had a brother or that he could skate.  9.  My sister emailed and said that she has had the funniest time in India and hasn't stopped laughing since she's been there. She wont mind if I copy her mail.  They have been watching people shitting in public alot, why I don't know.  "Steve spotted a boy yesterday at the flyover  hanging off a bit of scaffold letting it go about 10 feet  up in the air.  Not the kind of monsoon you want to get  caught up in!  Holds a new meaning to being shit on from a  great height!  Best comment from Steve of the week though - in taxi on  sat, and surrounded by beggars, Steve is trying to take our  minds off the unpleasantness of the situation with the  comment "what does everyone want for tea tonight?".  Slightly inappropriate laughter then followed!"  What do you expect these heartless people do work for a high street bank.  10.  India has people rolling food cigars in the street and we're worrying about mobile security weapons scanners?  I sometimes wonder who the fuck we think we are.  Right I'm off to drop the kids of at the pool.

      1.  I feel like I've been dragged through a hedge backwards tied to a burning log and then wanged (it's a verb check it), by trebuchet into a bed of stinging nettles and lego.  If you can picture me, I am sat at my desk in my office resembling Bruce Willis in Die Hard after all the bad stuff happens.  I don't think Vanish Oxy is gonna get these stains out of my vest.  2.  £4157 duly received from Billy Hill bookmaker and turf accountant.  Ascot is not just about stupid hats and Pimms.  What should I do with my new found wealth? I fancied getting loaded and putting the rest in the bank.  2.  Ray my accountant had other ideas.  He said Do you want to come on a course? -  What kind of course Ray? - It's nothing just a bunch of guys sitting round having a laugh - Okay so long as it's nothing like the fishing trip - that was three weeks well spent in a Spanish prison is not good for your soul or your back.  3.  So I arrange to meet Ray on friday evening.  He pulls up in a 1973 lowered VW camper van.  Nice van Ray.  Who's is it? - I borrowed it.  In retrovisuer why did I ignore this?  After driving into town we stop at a small community hall that you'd think was used by rats as a porno set, but we go in. It's surprisingly light, bright and full of white middle class people in loafers and check shirts.  There is a copy of the Daily Mail on an orange plastic chair and my hackles go up.  I look at Ray.  Don't worry Phrog these people are OK.  he makes an O gesture with his thumb and forefinger and winks madly at me.  I don't get it.  4.  I've been sat in a group session for about four minutes before the G word is mentioned.  I should say here that Ray is a recovering dope fiend. I'm thinking this is all for Ray's benefit and if called to I'll stand up and say some made up shit about how the 12 steps helped me.  But the G-word and the lurve word just keep coming and I decide I'm not listening anymore.  The group leader Troy, a smug fucker in worn courdroy and a golf jumper; believe me, Ned Flanders has nothing on this guy; asks me if I'd like to say anything about myself or why I'm here.  The entire group by this time had revealed at least one innermost weakness, apart from myself who's said nothing.  On the whole I'd say that the group was composed of several failed corporate washouts, a domestic abuser, a few sex addicts, two dope fiends including Ray and at least one psychotic.  I should have known better being a psychologist.  5.  I couldn't tell if Ray was pleased or disgusted when I threw the £4000 onto the floor in the ring and proclaimed "Let's get fucked up.  It's on me, the vans outside, who's coming?"  I was halfway to the door when I felt a tap on the shoulder.  It was Ray and I felt uneasy.  Phrogman he said, can we get some hookers?  6.  I had no idea where we were going to party.  Food and beer is cheap even for 8 and £4000 goes a long, long way.  If you've ever been to St.Pierre hotel and country club you'll know they have whole chalets by the lake you can rent for the weekend.  If you know the right people you can rent a whole lot more.  Who'd have thought a golf buggy would float?  Ray was nervous but I wasn't sure if he was nervous about scoring or not scoring.   - what is it Ray? - Are we, have we... - you want a little something Ray? - you know how it is phroggy - i do Ray, i do.  7.  I have to pop out for Ray.  I make a phone call, Ray gave me the numbers, he was twitching and trying to hold it together.  I needed to pick the stuff up, these folks were definitely not in the courier business.  8.  It took me a good hour to even find the place in the van.  I know the outlying country pretty well but this house was hidden like a prick at a wedding.  Several calls later I pulled into the drive.  I was just relieved to get there.  The door opened, I stepped in and came face to face with Troy, the group leader from the meeting.  Now I'm confused.  Has Ray just fucked me over or has he just given me the wrong number.  Either way he's pissed.  -Who the fuck did I think I was bustin' his gig like that? - These people mean alot to him - People like me give people like them a bad name - So I guess you're here to buy some coke?  9.  Whoah there Leslie.  Two large men appear from nowhere.  Troy continues.  I guess you're here to buy alot of coke since you busted in and walked off with most of my customers a little earlier?  Man as far as I could make out it was an introductory Alpha Course meeting that needed spicing up, I didn't know you was working a different kinda magic. - You don't look particulary stupid to me, so I'll let it go this time.  10.  I get back to the party to find Ray powerhosing the chalet with vomit(I didn't think you could shotgun a winebox but apparently you can.)  Two of the others were BBQing swan on the veranda that over looks the lake and the hookers look to have drunk the entire contents of the minibar.  11.  The bill has come to £4158, £2800 in room repairs alone.  I am a quid down on the day and I'm an Alpha Course Recruiter for a local christian drug baron.  Weekends don't get much better than this. Fantastic.

      1.  There is a new game in town.  Here's the deal.  Pick a book, movie, whatever and go find it on amazon.  Click on customer reviews and then sort them by the 1-star ratings.  People leave the most empty headed comments.  Here's a selection I just found.   Franz Kafta, The Trial.  "this book is boring and doesn't make any sense, i wonldn read it again" *** "I dont want to sound clueless, but, what trial? so, he was trapped as an accused man and had three choices of being acquitted and chose none, so he goes with the flow to die. So what then...? Why do we all have to be so analytical about this? What is the point?"    Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities  "While the subject is of some merit, from a historical perspective, this Dickens fellow has a lot to learn in the art of efficient prose. On and on he discourses, using three hundred words to describe on transitory happening, where thirteen words would do. Not enough sex, either.  Definately not written for the masses.  I suggest, as an alternative, anything by Alistair Cook"  This book was so bad, I considered it bad. MY eyes burned out. I almost was at the point of suciude after the first page. MY friend George suggested I read it for a book report. I didn't relize it was April Fools. Now Goerge is dead.  But then you can always reverse the game.   Titanic - The Movie.  First of all, this movie is an absolute masterpiece. I have no idea why there's been such a sudden backlash against it, people are just stupid. This is a glorious film, incredible production values, first class acting, dynamic special effects, breathtaking cinematography, wonderful story, outstanding music, everything about the film is just perfect. I can't find one fault in it. The way it depicts the human struggles of the characters, the arrogance of the ship's owners and passengers, the sheer proportions of the sinking, is nothing short of brilliance. You're involved with the characters and their struggles from beginning to end, it's incredible. One of the best movies ever made, period. Don't listen to those morons who call this film trash, they wouldn't know art if it came up and spat in their face. I'd give the film a very solid 10 out of 10.  Enough.  2.  My grandad is dying.  He is 91.  My nan is still alive and she too is 91 so how she will cope I have no idea.  They have been married forever.  It is all inevitable and upsetting.  3.  I am completely unprepared for the weekend although I suspect that I will not need to take alot with me.  Buying new shoes and getting a haircut saturday morning are definite priorities.  I am travelling on the Megabus which apparently has no toilets on it, being a double decker bus.  I'll let you know how that goes.  4.  I was thinking about readers last night and it occurred to me that it's obvious that not everyone is going to like what you write.  Some writers find this hard to take having poured precious hours, cigarettes and calories into their work.  The simple truth is that there are also a million different ways that people will find not to like your work.  Here's a few.       It's not as good as mine     The subject matter     The style     The characters        Subconscious signifiers (the author may include colours, smells, buildings etc that subconsciously turn people away     They don't get it; this could mean anything from, I couldn't be bothered to, I'm a bit thick me       I don't like everything I read or watch, so why should I expect everyone else to like my work?  5.  There are 6.9 million people imprisoned in the U.S.  which I find truly incredible.  Some clearly deserve to be locked up but from my understanding, alot are connected to minor drug offences.  These are people who could be contributing to an economy, but no they say, we'll bear the enormous cost of locking them up.  Is there any such thing as American social justice?  Read   urlLink Reefer Madness by Eric Schlosser   6.  Last night I wrote a pleasing little poem about surfing     Lose Yourself       Spitting liquid glass      Swallow plankton smoothie     Atlantic happy hour from the almighty     Lunar powered cocktail shaker     “Eat your greens!”     A supersize portion please     From the sea’s canteen     Boxed by rocks on three sides     Jellyfish drying out     In four sweeping, swelling feet     But it’s warm around the thighs     Let the piss out later     Wax on, fall off     Bruised ribs, hickey zip     All the time     Offshore it’s kicking off     The burning wait     And then she comes on cue     Leading lips, embracing arm     She sucks up and gobs us out     Tiny spiders sprawl   7.  Debra has had a dream about cake in her shoes.  She would get out more but obviously has a problem with her sweet trolley.  It reminded me of that shoe in your bedroom Tim, you filthy mutt.  8.  Laugh, I nearly did.  If this wasn't so scary it would be funny.  His latest gaffe. "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," he said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."  George W Bush. Tosser.  9.  I wrote something the other day about bullying and now there is  urlLink  this .  I'm afraid I really can't agree.  If every bullied child in Britain were to sue their LEA at the expense of the education another child where would that leave us?  This is not the answer.  10.  If I ever get into planetary design I'm gonna make all my oceans freshwater.

        1. I haven't had a cold for four years and now I get two in two months. How do kids survive? McToe had a cold for about a year when J was born. I am told newly qualified teachers are ill constantly but I suspect that's something to do with all the booze, bad diet and smokey environments like classrooms.        2. My new PC arrives on friday. I could have got one from a build your own site recommended to me but, no, support your local trader I say, and so Daniel from Pisces Computing is sorting me out. I wonder if he is a pisces? It's a bit of a giveaway as a businessman to tell everyone your starsign isn't it.      3.  The summer blockbuster is dead.  If you don't believe me look  urlLink  here    It's certainly put me off I-Robot.       4.  Manhunt, murder, fuck up.  The story of the "Manhunt" murder case took another twist    with the revelation that the game was present in the victim's home, not the killer's. As for the link between Manhunt and the crime, the police are clear. Pooni said: "We haven't connected the game with the murder and we've already made that statement, but some sections of the media    (The Daily Mail) chose to ignore it.the motive was robbery."  Thanks Sue Magoo.         5. It was inevitable wasn't it? I had to have a rant against the Daily Mail at some point but I will restrain myself and simply say the following: Although all newspapers are full of lies, distortions, half truths and propaganda, the Daily Mail is a chop job of everyone else's news garnished with a carefree sloppiness and misinformed paranoic view on the world designed to spread fear and mistrust amongst the middle classes. You wouldn't actually believe a politician is he came out with some of the diaohrreah they print, so why believe what you read? Go buy a decent paper or magazine like Club International and take your mind off the imminent terrorist disaster we are all facing for a few hours.    6. You will have noticed I am writing in green. I have a green pen at home and it smells of melon. It is very calming. Tip for all prospective writers, use smelly pens.    7.  Tarquin was quite right, Aubrey Strawberry   is absolutely incapable of expressing an argument. I don't think he is mentally deficient, it's just that no-one has taught him to use his brain and his tongue simultaneously. His nonsense isn't even good nonsense it's just boring.    8. It is possible that I have uncovered the existence of some shady cult activity in my small town. I can forsee a few weeks of infiltration, stealth, surveillance and eating donuts. Will keep you posted.  9.  My plan to separate my sleepy town from England has suffered another blow.   urlLink  Don't pay your henchmen peanuts    10 Apparently it costs £600 to get a licence to run a radio station. Bung in another grand and I think you have a promising little enterprise there. I'm sure S.E.R Beard, the comb over king of high street electrical retailers, will be taking out some serious peak airtime ads.

       1. The Chepstow Festival is like the Hay Festival of literature only we get airport novelists, Mills and Boon writers and the occasional C-List celebrity (last year we had Charlie from Bergerac). This year we were thrilled to be blessed with a literary celeb and a proper c-lister. What happened next was fairly predictable.  2. I met James Patterson in the bar of the Beaufort Hotel. I recognized him depsite the fact he was missing the hundreds of tiny pinholes in his face. I bounced up to him like Tigger on ether. "One hunnnnndredddd and eeeeeyyyyytttttyy." I bawled in his ear. You're James Patterson aren't you? "Yes.  Why did you just shout that in my ear?" "You are the 180th celebrity I've ever met.  Congratulations." "Thank you, but why did you shout?" "I was happy and you need a lesson in darts my friend."  3. Patterson is American and looks like Edward Woodward without the mystery attached. Just as JP was launching into his second pint of wifebeater, in walked the c-lister. Some might not regard Eamon Holmes as a c-lister but he himself does. He likes to see himself as the man on the sofa looking at the celebs rather than rubbing shoulders with them. Privately he'll admit that he'd only go around pinching their arses anyway. I introduced JP to Eamon. JP turned to me, "Why didn't you shout a number in his ear?" "What the hell are you talking about, you're not writing fiction now?"  I said.  4. The first time I met Eamon he was flicking towels at some screaming chalet girls in Val D'Isere. Shortly afterwards he was melting the snow outside. "I have phenomenal body heat" He used to brag. Now I was arranging a celebrity darts match between the big Irishman and the New Yorker. In two hours Eamon was due to be lighting the first firework to start the son et lumiere show at the castle. JP was giving a book reading and doing a signing just down from the hotel. It was my round, I ordered more strong European lager with chasers from the bar despite Eamon's protests.  5. JP was getting well into his arrows. He has a mind like a diamond tipped woodpecker when it comes to maths. Even Treble 19's, nothing was getting past this nuclear calculator except possibly how much he'd had to drink. Eamon was doing considerably better, more accustomed to the quality and quantity of strong European lager provided. JP threw his arm around me and told me how he'd learnt that bringing the wife on such occassions was ultimately disasterous, no fun, no fun. JP was seriously fucked up by the Cointreau challenge.  6. I have only ever known one person become violent on Cointreau and he's not here anymore to tell the tale and nor are the 2 Russian merchant seamen who took him so they could sell his warm liver. Eamon was as placid as bhuddist under hypnosis one minute and as angry as a man who's wife has had an affair with his son the next. Someone in the Beaufort has asked him for an autograph presuming him to be Terry Wogan. "Does this look like a feckin wig?" He shouted gripping his crown making him look crazier than Wile E Coyote on PCP. Eamon pushed the offender back causing him to knock into the blissfully unaware Patterson who was primed on the oche with a dart and ready to fly. Patterson was himself knocked to the side where he plunged the dart into the jugular of a hapless pensioner out with his wife for the evening.  7. Who'd have thought the old fella would have had so much blood? My grandfather is 94 and they top him up every two weeks with haemo-unleaded. Eamon was out of there like a shot, whilst the shock of all the blood sobered JP up instantly and he was busy stemming the pissing crimson.  8.  The ambulance arrived too late.  JP's wayward arrow had sucked all the juice out of the old boy.  9. Eamon was arrested live on local radio for an affray. I guess it's down to the CPS to decide if he gets done for manslaughter. James Patterson meanwhile attended his book reading and signing soaked in the blood of a dead pensioner. Some thought it was just a crazy attempt at American irony (he does write crime fiction afterall), others who had been in the bar just thought it was sick.  10. Afterwards JP came over and croaked in my ear. "This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't shouted in my ear." "This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't written such bloody awful books."  I replied.

      Jeanette sits and watches the TV only pausing to find her way into a bag of chips nestled in her ample lap.  Programmes have been interrupted in favour of a live police chase.  Jeanette would normally have switched over to some other afternoon cookery show like the one she’d been watching, (how she wishes she could cook), but this chase is happening right here in her own backyard, Vesper County.  She lets out an excited shriek and mindlessly drops the chips on the carpet as she gets up and runs to the window, just in time to catch the black and whites storm past, like a wall of stampeding zebra.  What the hell were they were chasing?  ***  	Lloyd makes the hard turn onto the interstate.  County lines mean shit nowadays.  There is only one thing between him and his goal; twenty flashing cherries screaming twenty different shades of blue murder in his mirrors.  The dumb procession seems to have gone on for hours when it can only surely be minutes.  Either way, Lloyd figures that he can get more clear thinking done up here than ten in Leavenworth.  He remembers the rants Wade, his brother, used to shout at the TV as if he were rehearsing for his own fifteen minutes on the freeway.  Wade hasn’t made the stage this afternoon but Lloyd clearly hasn’t got time to deal with that right now.  The one thing that Wade told him was that if they get real close or you feel a nudge like they’re trying to Pitt you, cut the engine and stand on the brake.  ***  	Officer Mike Vasquez is trying to get his brain to concentrate on six things at once.  There is no chance of him prioritizing them all but if he could make a list his top three would be as follows: 1.	Stay alive.  His baby is due any day now and he wants to see her; besides Carol would murder him if he comes back less than whole. 2.	Don’t kill anyone.  He can’t afford to be suspended what with the repayments. 3.	What the fuck am I following and how am I gonna stop it?  ***  Chad is an amateur storm chaser on his days off.  He’s still collecting most of the technical kit but what he has rattles around in the back of his estate like a Chinese kitchen in an earthquake.  Chad is checking the skies as he is prone to, even on busy highways.  He sits back in his seat, we’re not even in storm country yet.  Darkness suddenly descends over the dash like an instantaneous locust plague.  Chad desperately scans the sky once more with his head out the open window.  He knows very little of what happens next except that he is sent careering across the highway and down an embankment.  His last thought is “Sneaky goddamn tornados.”  ***  Doug Burnquist hates flying.  He’s not phobic about flying but another day in this whirlybird and he swears he’s gonna jump.  Doug is the traffic reporter for KBCOP.  It all began as a filler for a couple of weeks whilst the regular guy recovered from injuries sustained during a rotor failure (the chopper smashed into a roof killing the pilot).   It was either the eye in the sky or the big wave goodbye as his boss had said.  This morning after a skinful down at the Lazy Eye, Doug vomits on cue as Pete, the pilot aims the chopper over bus stops and smoking huddles.  Pete laughs uncontrollably.  Doug hates his life right now.  ***  Oscar de la Cruz sits on a bar stool with his back to the bar at the Lazy Eye.  It’s busy today but everyone gives Oscar space.  A double beep and he reaches into his breast pocket and pulls out his cell.  A text; it reads HOT PURSUIT IN PROGRESS. “Hey Jimmy, change it to channel 9.”  Oscar gets his wish and suddenly the entire bar turns to watch the chase.  Oscar squints at the screen silently assessing the situation.  After a few minutes he stands on the bottom rung of the stool and shouts. “Four to one says he won’t make the state line.”  There is no shortage of takers.  ***  Lloyd is rattled.  He can only think about Wade, his brother.  He dares himself to look back but can’t.  There had been a shot somewhere back there and he’s sure a large part of Wade hit the inside of windshield as they drove away.  From what he can see in the kiosk like cab, it was a part of Wade that definitely should be still part of Wade and it was unlikely that Wade could function without it.  The more Lloyd thinks about it the more he smiles to himself.  Wade was better off with a large section of his brain missing.  Who on earth  besides Wade would steal a London double-decker bus and use it as a getaway vehicle?  Lloyd is in fact unsure how a London bus gets to the mid-west to begin with but Lloyd does know one or two things.  He knows that all that stuff that Wade said about the Pitt manoeuvre don’t mean shit; they’d need a tank to stop this thing.  Lloyd also knows that it is unlikely that they’d try and use stop sticks in case the whole thing topples over like a cereal box.  ***  	Mrs McKinley is far from minding her own business.  In the last fortnight she has become obsessed with the movements of the woman in the house across the street.  She is sure that there is no good going on.  No woman should know that many men, let alone have them round as often as she does.  No sooner than one man leaves, another car pulls up, a man steps out, knocks on the door and the woman lets the man in.  Today she has counted twelve and it’s barely midday.  Mrs McKinley turns off the TV in the kitchen and reaches for her binoculars.  Another car pulls up.  ***  	Officer Mike Vasquez is no closer to imagining how this is all gonna end.  Control seems clueless and less than willing to sacrifice a few cars in the name of a roadblock.  A few of the guys alongside have been shouting on the private channel.  Mike can see them talking as he listens to them. “Someone shoot his goddamn tyres out, they’re big enough even you could hit Hennessy” “Why don’t you jump on the roof from the next bridge?” “Maybe I’ll land a chopper on the freeway.” “Maybe I’ll just shoot the fucker in the face.”  Mike turns back to the official channel on his radio.  There is a call for him to pull alongside and get a good look at the driver.  They need to know if he seems aggressive, if he’s wounded and whether he’s drunk.  ***  	Doug swallows an antacid and pulls it together for long enough to give some drama to proceedings.  He recalls his boss giving him tips before he went out for the first time.  “Remember, over emphasize everything.  If a stolen vehicle is doing forty in a thirty he’s rushing.  If he’s doing fifty he’s a maniac, sixty or seventy a death wish, over seventy and it’s like he’s raped your sister and killed your momma.  If a civilian comes within ten feet of the car, that’s attempted murder.  If he hit’s another vehicle, assault with a deadly weapon…” “I get the point.” “And for fuck sake watch out for Pete, sometimes he just has a little too much fun.” “Good to know.”  	The more Doug commentates the better he feels.  It’s only when he has to look down at the map or his notes that he feels sick. “You join us live over the Interstate here on K.B.C.O.P where we are following a suspect in what appears to be a stolen London bus of the double-decker variety.  As you can see there are approximately twenty to thirty patrol vehicles following.  Here’s what happened earlier when the bus was in collision with a member of the public driving on the freeway.”  ***  	The doorbell rings and Jeanette makes her way to answer it with her head fixed on the TV and the chase that is unfolding.  Jeanette opens the door and lets out her characteristic shriek as she watches the bus shunt the corner of an estate car sending it plunging off the road and into a ditch where it turns on its roof and explodes.  She turns to the man on her doorstep barely looking at his face before turning back to the TV. “Have you been watching this?” “Yeah, that’s why I’m here.  Can we watch at the same time?” “No problem honey.”  ***  Oscar has collected $500 in five minutes knowing full well that all of it is pure profit.  The occupants of the bar are whistling and shouting at the screen like freshmen.  He takes out his phone and calls his brother in law. “Hey, Mikey, how ya doin’?” “Oscar, I’m kinda busy right now as your fat ass can probably see.” “Yeah I can see you Mikey, but can you see him?  What kind of scumbag are we talking about here?” “Oscar, I can’t do this right now, I have a job to do.” “Mikey, Mikey.  I can be your eyes and ears, I can see what you can’t.  You want the glory ahead of them other fuckheads don’t you and let’s not forget you owe me one.” “But Oscar…” “Look there’s also a few bucks in it for you as if you didn’t know.” “Okay, okay.  Let me call you back.”  ***  Lloyd has been crying.  His sleeve is as wet as the sweat stained denim on his back.  In the bottom corner of Lloyd’s blurred eye, a dark shape edges in like octopus ink.  He turns to see a flashing black and white.  The driver is trying to get a good look at him so Lloyd slams himself back in the seat and hides his face behind a bulkhead.  He can hear the officer shouting something to the effect of “Pull over, pull over, do you want to get yourself killed?”  Lloyd looks at the blood on the windshield and thinks to himself.  “I don’t care.  I just don’t fucking care if I live or die.  People have been in situations like this, on the run for much less.  Runnin’ stop signs or forgetting to pay for their gas, I’m just trying to get my brother home.  Lloyd jerks the wheel down and the huge red block lurches towards the patrol car which swerves in reaction and then moves out of sight.  ***  “Did you see that.  Attempted murder right there.”  The audience can almost see his pointing finger in their minds.  Doug has forgotten his helicopter belly and is finally beginning to see what all the fuss is about.  Guilty people doing bad things live.  When did all the sympathy disappear?   “I’m goin’ down for a closer look.” Pete has an aviator’s grin.  ***  The sudden swerve wakes Wade from his unconsciousness and gets to his knees.  He feels light headed and he can’t see straight but this is not unusual for a man who drinks a quarter of the output of his local microbrewery each week.  Thinking he has just rolled off the couch, he sleepwalks his way up the stairs to bed taking his gun with him.  The stairs are all twisty, he don’t remember them being like that, maybe Lloyd changed things round.  Wade reaches the top.  This is weird and I got blood on me.  Why is he out on the porch and why has Wade got all the Xmas lights on?  That repetitive bass thud was familiar and getting louder.  Wade smashes the back window of the bus with the butt of the shotgun and sees the object of his fury closing in on him fast.  Wade has no option but to fire.  ***  Lloyd heads for the off-ramp.  He looks up.  Something is wrong, desperately wrong.  He pats himself down for signs of injury but finds nothing.  ***   Jeanette is curled up on the couch facing the TV.  She looks up from the stumpy penis she is sucking to see a puff of smoke emerge from the back of the bus.  She lifts her head.  “Wow did you see…” A hand forces her head back down into the man’s crotch.  “Oh yeah baby, I saw it.”  ***  Wade has shotgun satisfaction.  Both barrels fat and square on target.  The chopper gives a little roll of acknowledgement and then a full bow down and to the right.  ***  Officer Vasquez who has been patiently tailing, patiently waiting for further instruction, looks up at the back window of the bus.  The radio bursts into life “Shot’s fired.”  He hates the way that officers have a knack of stating the obvious.  He’d reported in a while ago that the driver just looked like a normal scared white guy.  He picks up the mic, “He’s heading down the off-ramp.”  ***  Lloyd decides to drive through the swirling miasma of wrongness.  Stopping is out of the question, going faster is not and he stamps on the gas.   ***  Doug is hanging half out of the helicopter and is live on air.  “We’ve been shot at.  We’ve been shot at.”  He remains cool.  This could be his moment.  Being shot at wasn’t that bad, he even saw the flash even if he didn’t hear the bang through his headphones and over the noise of the chopper.  Not even a scratch.  He gives his voice the chance to calm down.  “As the bus got on the off-ramp, we, the K.B.C.O.P eye in the sky has come under fire, apparently from a passenger on the top deck bus   ***  Wade turns and faces the front of the bus in time to see a crumpling metal monster tearing towards him like a wave.  It screams at him like the demonic child he once was.  He has no time to react except to wave the shotgun at the monster as he sees it.  ***  Officer Vasquez is pinned by the swathe of steel, seats and body parts that once formed Wade and the roof of the bus.  As his car explodes into a hot and blackened tangerine ball of flame his last thoughts are of his unborn baby and his angry wife.  He couldn’t even do this right.   ***  Doug senses that the chopper has been banking right for some time now.  They are moving away from the action and it’s really beginning to kick off down there.  Doug rights himself and turns to see that Pete has lost more than his nerve.  Doug screams like a girl as the chopper goes into a steep dive.  ***  Oscar is back on his stool.  The bus appears to have stopped shortly after losing its roof to a low bridge.  “Looks like I win folks.”  There are shouts of disapproval from the floor and a few people throw matches and other lightweight items at him. He sinks his beer, belches loudly and makes for the front door. Oscar has one hand on the door of the Lazy Eye. “So long losers.”  He opens the door and is temporarily blinded by the light.  When he regains his vision, he is surprised to see the K.B.C.O.P chopper travelling at speed, only a few feet from his face.  ***  “Time’s up big boy.”  Jeanette zips the man up and searches for another channel covering the pursuit but fails to find one.  Her face is a portrait of disappointment. “We should do this again sometime.” “Sure whatever,” she says and holds out her hand.  ***  Lloyd looks up and enjoys the fresh air and clear sky.  The bus is handling a lot better now she’s just a regular coach.  From what he can tell, the roof blocked the freeway.  He’s lost the cops and for the first time he dares to think the unthinkable.  ***  Mrs McKinley watches another man leave and she adds a ‘one’ to the spreadsheet she’s keeping.  The IRS will no doubt have something to say even if the police don’t.  She returns to her binoculars.  To her amazement, a large red shape fills her wide eyes.

          1. A very boozy weekend starting with a session at Chez Tarquinius on friday for Big Brother and beer. Saturday was dirty and frustrating until the evening when I retired to the middle of nowhere for muchos protein enrichment, more beer , wine and Pernod. Suffice to say my head yesterday morning felt like fucking punch bag.  2. Instead of enjoying the glorious sunshine, the sofa, some bacon fries, a large fruit smoothie and the test match provided cold comfort for my aching head. I also watched Cold Mountain. Directionless, depressing and disappointing stuff from Minghella. Not his best and frankly I expected the film to be more beautfully shot than it was. I didn't even know Ray Winstone was in it till the credits rolled, doh.  3. The FA is in a crisis of its own making. What has shagging the office bike got to do with anything anyway. I agree with David Mellor on Radio 4 this morning in that why have some bloke who's experience to date is managing Doncaster Rovers FC administrating and regulating a billion pound industry? This will be good for the FA in the long term.  4. Architrave is one of my favourite words and 53630th most used word in the English language. Fucking is 3048th and cunt is 18636th. The people who run the  urlLink Wordcount Site  have obviously never worked in a Tesco's distribution warehouse just outside Newport where those two words are the second or third most popular. "Fucking fuck off you fucking fucker" being my fave. Use an adjective and you probably went to private school.  5.  A man with greater wisdom, more moral fibre, guts, and bad jackets than anyone of us.  urlLink My hero   6. Hello Charlotte my darling. Sorry for texting you back at 1:30 in the morning but I was unaware of my place in the multiverse by that stage. You were probably still up and wrestling a muscle bound Cuban at that time anyway.  7.  Another Yahoo pick I have plundered is  urlLink  The Illustrated Smiths .  All the best Morrissey lines turned to crayon and felt tip.  Truly grilliant.  8. I have finished my Worlds Wildest Police Chase Story but I am bereft of ideas for a title. I will publish here later today.  9. Hooray, the concrete has arrived and tomorrow the project can begin. By friday, this town will have it's very own full size wind turbine replica. I shall name it after a Fall track, "It's just alot of wind."  10. Disappointed to hear some crank from the Keep Britain Tidy campaign, decrying graffiti. If they stopped cleaning it up, it wouldn't cost millions to remove would it? What would be easier would be if we licensed the good artists and shot the others at dawn. Here's the best in the west,  urlLink  Banksy  and here's a link for you lot at UKAuthors to my story about grafitti.  urlLink  Night Fishing

       1. Listened to a programme on Radio 4 last week about reality TV. I can't stand these things; apparently there is something on this week called My Breasts Are Too Big. People trust television and everything that is associated with it mainly because we associate it with good. Somehow we still associate TV with a 1950's golden age. But TV is entertainment and it is often not in its interest to show you anything that makes you uncomfortable, therefore it re-inforces the belief that TV is good. Adverts strengthen this feeling. The difficulty comes when you realise that TV is not all good. The TV industry is often poorly run, underbudgeted and unprofessional. The nature of the industry means that the bottom line is cash and therefore anything like support for the people, or the families of people who appear on the shows, is likely to be and is often poor. There is an increasing argument for some kind of regulation in this area. Maybe someone will die as a result of one of these shows or more than likely sue them to death, and things will change.  2.  Personally I believe that  urlLink Catherine Zeta Jones  should be tested to see if she is psychologically well enough to stand trial. You can't tell me that if you have that much wealth, you can't get decent security. I don't suppose she even answers her own phone. If movie stars are prepared to flirt with us and whore themselves for the huge sums they do, then they need to accept that there will be a few psychotics out there amongst the people who do worship them. You gota take the crunchy with the smooth. Along with Hopkins, I have a somewhat sceptical opinion of CZJ and their new found Americanism, only because they seem to turn on the Welsh when it suits their purpose. Come on you bitch, drag me through the High Court.  She is quite fit in Deception though.  3.   urlLink  Richard Madeley strikes again.   and you've got to feel sorry for him. He's always struggled to keep his language and culture skills up to date and now the lesbians have rounded on him. From the article, here are some of the terms you might like to use when addressing bush pilots everywhere.        Boy/boi - boyish gay man or boyish lesbian          Heteroflexible - straight person with gay 'mindset'          Hasbian - lesbian who's gone straight

       1. Well, where do I start? How about waiting for my sister's stool results to come back from the doctor. She's just come back from a business trip in India and now she can't so much as cough without sweating it. Well if you go off to do the devil's work you can be sure that you will pay for it in the end. To be fair she did have salmonella a few years back and dat was not pleasant. Apparently they grew a full size velociraptor out the culture in her blood and it went on a week long killing spree in Newport, South Wales.      2. I was doing a little research on Laura Bush, since I was wondering how a librarian becomes a world authority on stem cell research and wow, I never knew that...    On the evening of     6 November 1963    , two days after her 17th birthday, Laura Welch failed to stop her Chevy sedan at a stop sign and smashed into a Corvair being driven by a school chum, Michael Douglas, also 17. Laura and her passenger, Judy Dykes, were treated for minor injuries at a nearby hospital, where they learned that     Douglas     had died from his injuries. No police charges were filed, apparently, but paperwork from the accident is missing or unclear and the details of the incident are a bit of a mystery. Now Laura Welch is married to      U. S.      president George W. Bush and is known around the world as LAURA BUSH. The story made national news during the presidential election of 2000, but little new information came to light. At the time her spokesman, Andrew Malcolm, said "To this day Mrs. Bush remains unable to talk about it."    3. I'm looking forward to the Olympics about as much as I'm looking forward to major exploratory surgery for an unknown brain condition. Here's a conversation I had with an athletics coach yesterday.     DF: "As a coach, are you looking forward to the Olympics?"     COACH: "The athletes are all on drugs, I'm not interested anymore."     DF:  "They're not   all   on drugs surely."     COACH: "Hmm yes they are."     DF:  "What makes you say that?"     COACH: "The moral and ethical side has been lost forever. Whilst it is still a great honour and achievement to get any kind of medal, the money is the key thing. If you dope up, get a medal and don't get caught, cool, che-ching."     DF:  "And if you get caught..."     COACH: "Whatever, makes no difference, it was a risk to do with the money. It didn't work, try something else, a different sport until you hear that che-ching noise."     DF:  "How do you know all this?"     COACH:  "I supply the drugs."      4. If I am interested in any event at the Olympics, then it's probably the low jumping. In traditional high jumping you start from a low place and get higher. In low jumping you start from a high place and get lower. The person who wins is the one who jumps lowest without dying. Anyone can take part really, the training is not overwhelmingly athletic, it's more about technique.      5.  Bored in the office?  I love this     little flash game    .  Thank you Sue McGoo.      6.  I hate Eastenders but for those of you who can't get enough.  I'd click     here   .  That's quite funny for some unknown reason.      7. I managed to set up the new PC and it only took 3 hours of head scratching. I do have a feeling that my cordless phone made it crash twice and I don't know why. Anyway the next week is going to be spent very sadly I have no doubt. Still gagdets save you loads don't they. My Xbox- has saved me from a decent social life, meeting new people, having anything to talk about when I do...the list is endless. The thing about blogs tho', is that they do make you think.      8.  Prozac in the drinking water?   I thought things were looking up for no discernable reason.      9. Prince Charles has started reading my blog apparently. The other day he described it as 'horrendous'. Well fuck you Charlie.     COACH: Dogfrog he was talking about windfarms     DF:  Are you still here you drug-dealing android builder?  What do you know anyway?     COACH: About what, windfarms or your shit blog mate?     DF:  Why you...     COACH:  Put that down, look I've got a wife and kids to support, that could really hurt.     DF:  You should have thought of that before you got Jonathon Edwards banned.     COACH:  No I didn't.  Look how about some temazapan, £30 for 20     DF:  Are they any good with cider?      10.  That's my evening sorted then.

           This story is based on a Belle and Sebastian song on The Boy With The Arab Strap called Space Boy Dream.       I don’t think I’ll ever be warm again. Sometimes it’s as if my weightless spine has been replaced with a cloudy column of ice like the cores retrieved from the Artic. Those cores contain the climatic history of the Earth and the scientists that measure its change over many hundreds of thousands of years can’t have helped but notice that no matter how far back you go it never seems quite far enough.      It is easy to keep things cold in space than it is too keep things warm. The average temperature of space is staggeringly cold. Using the Kelvin temperature scale, where Zero Kelvin is the same as absolute zero , the equivalent of minus 273 degrees Celsius, you really get to understand how cold space is. Water freezes at +273 Kelvin and water boils at +373 Kelvin. If I put a thermometer in darkest space it would first have to cool off. This could take a very a while. Once it cooled off, it would read something like 2.7 Kelvin. Elton wasn’t wrong when he said it wasn’t the kind of place to raise your kids.         And then there is the darkness. Several of the crew have reported seeing things but they are surely hallucinations. Lock yourself in a dark room for two years and tell me you haven’t started seeing things. The darkness is the ultimate nihilism especially for a scientist. It’s not until you witness the nothingness, the wall, the fucking mind fucking self reflecting mirror that all the theories we learnt on Earth begin to melt away. At first you ignore it; pretend it’s like the stupid friend who’s always ready to say the wrong thing. It creeps in at first but then it tacitly nudges and shoulders past the corner of your crusty eye with the bravado of a con-artist. Confrontation is inevitable; it comes to us all out here. It is here and it makes you forget that you are not actually part of it.       The darkness inevitably makes you think about the richness of our life on Earth; shapes, colours, sounds and the wealth of possibility. How could you ever run out of things to talk or think about? In this darkness I want to say that I will never be bored again once I return, but I know that this can never be true. Because of our birthright, it is natural that our first instinct is to reject darkness. Earth has rhythms; space whistles imperceptibly and forces you to beat out your own time on any handy surface.    Out here the darkness tempts us all with its illusory embrace. The darkness is a different desert since our enemies are neither the sun nor our thirst. Our enemies are ourselves and the demons that only we can summon. Pablo’s not as stupid as he looks. “The trouble with nothing space,” we all had our names for it, “is that the only reality that means anything is in your head. I can’t wait for it to end; I mean it doesn’t even feel like we’re moving.” He is right; all we have is the gauges.      As our old theories melt a new one begins to emerge. Thomas explained it to me last night on the watch. He had been experiencing hallucinations like the rest of us only his face looked as if he'd swallowed a good deal of what he had been immersed in. I had to shake and slap him before he came round. When he did, he told me what he had seen.    “Our greatest mistake was that our theories about the Universe and the Big Bang were formulated on Earth. You get out here and it’s like bullshit, quantum fucking bullshit. There’s nothing out here, not even anything to wipe off the windshield. But then as you look it changes you and you realise that you’ve been fooled. You were looking at the darkness when you should have been looking through the darkness and you start looking harder and then harder still until…BOOM.” He clapped his thick mittened hands together. “You’ve just made something out of nothing and then it dawns on you." He paused. "That is precisely what God did.”      Thomas was exquisitely pleased with himself and secretly I was profoundly jealous of the fact that he’d got there first despite knowing that we would have all got there by ourselves eventually.      There was a tapping noise. Every event on board at the moment meant stopping to determine whether it was a real event or a hallucinatory one. No one had reported any auditory hallucinations as yet. I looked around me; no-one had entered the control module; fucking with people somehow went with the territory. It seemed to be coming from outside as if someone was tapping on the window. I got to my feet and on tip toes, carefully leant over the control desk and peered over the nose of the craft into the darkness. Something caught my eye. A solitary tiny star cracked the dark mirror below us. I brushed a magnifying tear from the glass and looked closer concentrating on the one thing in my sky that shone other than this tin can. I watched transfixed as the crack split along its vertical plane slowly at first and the light burst into the cockpit like a new dawn. I raised my gloved hand to cover my eyes and a voice came from the light.       “Hello.    Is anyone there?”    A gloved hand reached through the rip in the dark cloth.    Someone was beside my face, I could smell whoever it was; presumably another prank from my crew.    You grow to hate people you have to share oxygen with.       “Who are you, how did you get here?”        “We’re here to get you out sir.      There’s been an accident.      Right now we’ve got most of the factory on top of us, so we need to proceed carefully.”      I was powerless as the man strapped an oxygen mask on my face.      A radio cracked and the oxygen was starting to have an effect.      “Yeah I’ve got one alive down here and from what I can see two dead.”      I turned my head and could see that Thomas and Pablo remained locked in the darkness.

      1. Yesterday I was awake by 8 O'clock with a tongue like Ghandi's sandal and in assorted pain.  I couldn't even face breakfast.  It took me an hour to pack up and stumble out into the heat.  I just wanted to be somewhere comfortable like in the joint bosoms of Nigella Lawson and Kate Winslet.  2.  I sat down on a bench in Bloomsbury Park sweating and hallucinating about Virginia Woolf.  What the hell happened last night?  I remember leaving the Poetry Cafe in toe with someone called Maggie.  She'd just turned up randomly for the evening apparently.  I believe we went for something to eat (pizza possibly?).  Yes it was because I remember saying "What have you ordered?" , "Margarita", "Great I love tequila.","No it's a pizza", "Fuck, do they do cocktails?", "I think you've had enough."  I'd had enough it was true.  The 3 Stella's and the Staropramen Smirk gave me as he left hadn't helped and quite why I thought I needed a bottle of red to keep me going through the night was beyond me.  3.  So when I explained that I was pretty much a London virgin (not entirely true), and she, Maggie needed to show me the sights, I guess I was asking for it.  I have no idea what the club was called but, I was assured that it was gonna be good.  "What kind of club is it?", "It's a women's bar."  Really I replied, my pissed mental image conjuring something like the Full Monty.  The young lad (so I thought) showed us downstairs.  It soon became pretty clear that these ladies were not interested in poorly choreographed male strippers.  I ordered a beer to take my mind off things for a while...  4.  What to do all day.  I was there early for the opening of the British Museum.  The great courtyard is based around the great reading room where they have brilliant touchscreen pc's.  I slid unnoticed up towards the impressive glass roof and the restaurant that looks down over the library.  A guestbook lay open on the side with a pen just there egging me on.  It would seem that Sven Goran Erikkson enjoyed his meal rather more than the other guests.  5.  From the British Museum I wandered down Charing Cross Rd and had some lunch.  My feet were killing me and I have blister the size of a rugby ball.  Next stop was the National Gallery which I would have enjoyed immensely if I hadn't been so tired.  How tacky is Sunflowers by Van Gogh?  How big is The Bathers by Seurat?  That's what I love about going to these big and famous galleries is that you really get an appreciation of scale and texture which you can never get out of books or the interweb.  6.  My new PC has arrived but I have a new set of problems.  I don't think they've loaded a bios or any kind of software so I'm gonna have to scramble around for that and my XP disc which is proving elusive.  7.  If the weather can't be pleasant then I want it to be miserable.  None of this hot fog business.  I blame Ming the Mercilless  8.  I'm looking for a 10 foot longboard.  If you spot one for sale and it's less than £300 mail me double quick.  9.  I am resolved to never get on the Megabus again.  Fortunately I have a bladder like a 1950's leather football so I can torture others on the bus by swigging liberally from litre bottles of water.  The Megabus is cheap but it's also uncomfortable, slow, rhythmically vomitous (it sways like a boat from opposite corner to corner), oh and did I mention it's really fucking uncomfortable?  I felt like doing  urlLink this   when I got home.  10.  It was grilliant to meet virtual people this weekend.  There is a tendency to forget at the end of every keyboard there is a person.   Essentially most people are just as nice and as pleasant as they are when you meet them in lesbian nightclubs.  I don't know why it hasn't become second nature.
