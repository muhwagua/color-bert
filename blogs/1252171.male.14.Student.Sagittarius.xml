      Sorry 4 not writing 4 a  looooooooooong  time. I couldn't find anything interesting to talk about. Here's the runthrough of the past week: 1)I'm mad at my dog right now, since he chewed up 3 of my Gamecube games  and  my Gameboy Advance!!! 2) I was going to put this on my other site, but 2 nights ago was one of the biggest events in my 13-years of living:  SpongeBob's Lost Episode!!!   3) Last night was the school dance and Mike blew off Mandy urlLink   by not showing up for their "date" that night. That's all for now!

      Hi there, Gage here.  urlLink Kab  updated his site today, and probably one of the longest plotlines is finally over! I'm updating from my mom's work today. She's an MRI technologist, and I'm using one of the doctor's computers. Anyways, last night I was playing Rayman and there were these really creepy enemies called Knaaren, and they say things like, " Fresh brains ," or, " Tear off his flesh ." *Shudder*.Well, gotta go. See ya!

      Don't know what SU and SatAM are? SHAME. ON. YOU. SU is Sonic Underground, a little known Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon featuring Sonic and his siblings, Sonia and Manic, searching for their mother, Queen Aleena. SatAM is a Saturday morning Sonic cartoon featuring Sonic, Tails, Princess Sally, and all their freedom fighter friends. SatAM DVDs can't be released because of third party rights. The culprits? Disney and Buena Vista. At the time SatAM was created, Disney owned DiC, which created SatAM. The only reason SU wasn't condemned by 3rd party rights was because it was made by a low budget company who worked for DiC. Finally, most people think that if enough people buy SU DVDs, that DiC will be able to make SatAM DVDs for reasons I don't know. So until next time, buy, buy, buy!

      Sa2b here. I have yet to tell you more about me. My last name is Tame (same with Camo and Knumchuck). Foxy's last name shall not be released for security reasons. Katt's and Hobbes' last name is Tygre. Pheen's last name is Niks. And finally, Leon's last name is Strechel. I also have some friends that don't live with me:  Cybe (last name not releasable): 18 yrs. Jane Strechel (Leon's sister and Cybe's girlfriend):18 yrs. William Blaine (everybody calls him B.B. for short): 7 yrs. Pyde Arack: 17 yrs. Giette Armour (Pyde's girlfriend and calls B.B. Baby Blaine): 17 yrs.  OK, Mack must be running out of robot ideas. Today he sent a pink robo-bunny holding a drum after us. I kicked it once and its battery fell out. Pa-the-tic. A guy downstairs came back from doing some marshmallow commercial. Before he could even get in the door another guy punched him into a wall. I think the first guy left an imprint. Katt and Camo (against his will) got the double's high score on DDR Max 2. And... hold on.   Gage just called. He told me to post that his dad got HULK on DVD. I've seen it already when it was in theaters. Well, I forgot what I was going to say before. Oh, well. Bye!

      Sa2b again. More on me:  I live in a place you will never find. I live in the penthouse suite of a hotel you've never heard about. So don't try to visit me, because you'll just get lost. I have special abilities you don't have. I use these powers to fight this evil, crazy guy named Mack who builds these weird killer robots. You've probably never heard of these attacks because nobody except the town I live in knows about them. Well, except Gage. Me and my girlfriend are 18.Camo, Katt, Leon, and Hobbes are all 17. Knumchuck and Pheen are 16.  Anyways, today was a  really  boring day. All I did really was play SSBM with Camo, Foxy, and Hobbes while Katt played with a DDR Max 2 kiosk she won in a prize grabber machine (I don't know how that happened either). Knumchuck and Pheen were on the computer and Leon was reading the newspaper. I'll tell you about more of my friends next time. Foxy's tugging on my sleeve to go on the computer. Bye!

      Hi, everyone! My name is Sa2b (SA-toob). Gage will not feel like updating for the next few weeks, so I will be filling in for him. Here is some info about my friends and family:  Middle bro: Camo Little bro: Knumchuck (blind, but can "see" in his own way.) Girlfriend: Juliet (nickname: Foxy. Seriously.)

      Sorry for not posting for so long. Me and the rest of the gang went to a local theme park. And, of course, Katt ownzored the high score on the Dance Dance Revolution game at the arcade. ANYAWAYS... if you go to  urlLink homestarrunner.com  right now, you'll see that there's going to be a CD out  next week!  Well, Pheen needs to check one of her many favourite sprite comics.

      As my 1st official update, before I came back, Sa2b discovered he had a long lost sister (yes, it happens)! Her name is Noire (oooo, french! It's pronounced NWAR for those who don't know), and as of right now, it seems as if she has a slight crush on Hobbes of all people =O! So, there ya go. Oh! And the Homestar Runner CD is out. It's called:    STRONG BAD SINGS! and other type hits    And, as an added bonus, my birthday's comin' up! YYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY!!!! Laterz.

      I hate depressing teen shows. Barely anyone is happy, and a new problem comes up practically every 6 freakin' seconds! Some examples are 7th Heaven and Degrassi. Oh, and if you don't agree with me, 3 guesses whose problem that is. No, not my dog's. Definitely not mine. Exactly.  YOUR'S .

      Oh, um, hi. It's Camo. Gage e-mailed us to post this. He said he would usually post something of this calibur on his other site, but he's saving something special for that. He saw  Plankton's Army / Missing Identity , the newest SpongeBob episodes. He said they were goodly funny (and that's a straight dictation). So, um, bye.

      Hi, I'm Juliet, Sa2b's girlfriend, but you can call me Foxy! Gage e-mails us every once in a while to tell us things he wants us to post, and his last e-mail said that he got South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Then I said to myself,"Hey! I saw that!" Now, if you'll excuse me, it's Katt's turn.

      Hi there! Hobbes here. Sorry we haven't posted in a while. But I was just playing SSB:M and noticed that if you have the beam sword or a sword weilding character, you'll notice that there's an aura-type thing following the slash. if you pause right when you hit your enemy, it will show the path of the sword and it will look like you slashed through their leg or head or something. Sometimes you  can imagine what they would be saying like, "Oohh, my ear!" Well, I put something new in the corner. They're called "things to think about."

      ONLY IN AMERICA!!!!!!!!  Only in America - can a pizza get to your house faster than an ambulance.  Only in America - are there handicap parking places in front of a skating rink.  Only in America - do drugstores make the sick walk all the way to the back of the store to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front.  Only in America - do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries, and a diet coke.  Only in America - do banks leave both doors open and then chain the pens to the counters.  Only in America - do we leave cars worth thousands of dollars in the driveway and put our useless junk in the garage.  Only in America - do we buy hot dogs in packages of ten and buns in packages of eight.  Only in America - do they have drive-up ATM machines with Braille lettering.  Only in America - are the least useful professions (professional athletes, movie actors & entertainers) paid so disproportionally much compared to people with normal jobs.

      "Mack, why must you always come at the worst time!" said Sa2b. "We haven't seen each other in 16 years and have a lot of catching up to do!" "Awwwww, how sad," said Mack, an orange weasel witha giant chipped tooth and red stripes, "remind me to cry after I stomp your ashes into the ground!" Just then, a giant robot hand shot out and grabbed Noire, "HEEEEEELLLLLPP!!" she screams. "Hold on... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!" screams Sa2b as he is belted into a far wall. Soon everyone has left an imprint in the walls, except Hobbes who had cowardly jumped behind a dresser. "HEEEEEEEELLLLLPP!!" Noire screams again. Suddenly, Hobbes' eyes start to darken. "He's going feral!" exclaims Sa2b, who is picking up his teeth that had come loose. It's true. Hobbes had the ability to snap and go crazy at will, but usually only when he's  really  mad. At this point, he had only one thing on his mind:  Who are you, cutie?  His eyes became slits, his fangs got bigger, and 3 inch claws came out of each finger. The hairs on his back stand up, and he lets out a loud, "RAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWRRRR!!!" With a couple fast slashes, plus a couple bruises, and robot go BOOM! Hobbes then returns to normal (if you can call it that). He then is tackle-hugged by Noire. "Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you! I thought I was a goner!" "Umm, your welcome, but could you please stop choking me?" "Oh, okay. Maybe I'll just do this." Then she kisses him. Hobbes just sits there, bewildered. Usually, he'd be trying to put the moves on Foxy. He's never actually met someone who  likes  him. "Um," says Noire, "did I do something bad?" "Naw, just give it a bit to sink in," explains Sa2b, who had replaced his teeth. Just then, Hobbes flies through the roof. "WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!! I"VE GOT A GIRLFRIEEEEEND!! YEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHH!!" "I guess he does," says Noire.    THE END   -Sane Intolerant-

      It was a stormy night. The sound of two babies crying is the only thing that peirces the hard pounding of the rain on the ground. The two turn out to be baby hedgehogs. One yellow with green hair, the other pink with blue hair. Each with a unique Nightcrawler-ish tail. A gutter sweeps the two away from each other.  16 years later, neither one knows the other exists.  Cinkaeko Citadel, North Island. A female hedgehog walks through her house and turns on the TV. "Sa2b Destructico Tame saved Central City for the third time this week," she turns the TV off and turns to walk out the door. As her trench coat flies up from the force of the turn, her most noticeable feature is the white-blue Nightcrawler tail. When she reaches the door, she vanishes in a puff of smoke.  Central City, South Island. Sa2b Tame and his girlfriend Juliet "Foxy" Prower, a yellow two-tailed fox with white-tipped purple hair, are watching Rouroni Kenshin on TV when there is a knock on the door. Sa2b gets up and walks over to the door of their hotel penthouse suite. He opens the door and is instantly tackle-hugged by the mysterious pink hedgehog. "BRO!" she yells, "I've been looking all over for you!" "Who are you?" asks Foxy. "My name is Noire Catastrica Tame. I'm Sa2b's sister." "Whaaaaaaaaaa?!?" Foxy and Sa2b said simultaneously in an anime type fashion. "Yep. We were separated 16 years ago." Sa2b (who finally gets a solo speaking line in) asks, "How could you remember something that long ago?" "That depends," said Noire, "do you know what you had for breakfast all last week?" "Well, no." said Sa2b. "Exactly." Hobbes Tygre walks in the room. "Hello," he says, "who are you?" "I'm Noire. Who are you, cutie?" said Noire, cooly. "Uhhhh, I'm Hobbes Tygre." said Hobbes, nervously. Suddenly, an explosion rocked the hotel. "Awww, man! I just replaced that wall  last  week!"   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-

      So today I'm watching Excel Saga, an anime I like, and the main character, Excel, gets shot by the person she loved and worked for! Now, people on this show have died before, but come back somehow. But this was a  serious  death. And this is a comedy anime. Excel puts her hand over the wound and looks at all the blood that's pouring out, and I'm just sitting there in awe and I'm like, "Oh my God...." *Sniff*, she was so young, and so hot. That guy she worked for is such a jerk, killing an agent of his like that. So basically, it was a serious moment in a comedy anime, and I'm anxious to see the next ep to make sure Excel's gonna be okay.... -Sane Intolerant-

      Hello. You probably noticed when I first introduced them that, between the weird names and strange happenings, Sa2b and friends are not real. I made them up. They're actually based off the characters of the Sonic the Hedgehog universe. Here is a description of Sa2b:  Species: Hedgehog Gender: Male Tail: purple, Nightcrawler-ish Eyes: yellow Shirt: White, plus leather jacket Pants: jeans Shoes: orange, brown toe, brown heel, brown stripe across middle Hair: green, going up in a "V" shape Skin: yellow Gloves: Double-fold with slits at knuckles  And next time I'll tell you about when Sa2b and Noire first met. -Sane Intolerant-

My hobbies are roller-bladeing, drawing, listening to my parent yell at me, day-dreaming, day-dreaming while my parents yell at me, and thinking of people.  glshakhdosuhkruglie  I am also very random.  Me and mandy are friends to.  I am a guy but I don't like her in that way.  One more thing: sometime last week was the 1 year anniversary of this site.

      Ummm, where did I leave off? Ohhhhhhhh, yeah.  " DDR Max, 2! "  Katt gives a gasp of surprise, and Camo gives a gasp of horror. "I won a DDR Max 2 kiosk!" "Peeeeeeeeeerrrrrfeh-ka-teh," says Camo, sarcastically, "let's go look at some of the other rides." "Kay," says Katt, and she puts the kiosk back in its capsule. They went on a slew of different rides, including the Tilt-O-Whirl (run by my friend Shane), and Katt found out that one of the things Camo should do is eat  after  the rides. At the end of their vacation, they decide to go to the gift shop, run by  urlLink Mandy . "Hey there!" says Mandy, "What will you be buying today?" "Ummm, how about this 1' Nightcrawler action figure?" asks Katt. " No, that's mine," says Mandy. "All 120 of 'em?" says Camo. "Yes," says Mandy. "How about this stand-up cardboard cut-out of Nightcrawler?" asks Camo. "NO! Not that! Definetly not that!" screams Mandy. "Okay, we'll just take these issues of Sonic the Hedgehog," says Katt, all weirded out. "That'll be $6.57, please," says Mandy, politely. "Thanks," they say, and quickly leave. "Well, I thought this vacation went pretty well," says Camo. "Me too," says Katt, and she gives Camo a small kiss on the cheek, "Wanna play DDR when we get home?" "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!" screams Camo as he runs off. "Hey, get back here!" says Katt as she gives chase.   THE END  -Sane Intolerant-

      Katt and Camo walked around the park, looking for a good ride. Suddenly, they spotted something. "Hey Gage!" they called. "Hey guys. What're you doing here?" " We could ask you the same question," she said, eyeballing the teacup ride behind me. "Oh, this? Yeah, I run it. I also run the arcade here." "How can you run two places at once?" asked Camo. "It's easy when it's just your imaginary self. Oh! Gotta go. The teacher's saying something important," I say, as I vanish. Katt and Camo move on to the roller coaster. "There's no one here," says Katt. She then sees a note that says:   Be back in 10 minutes. Please use coin-operated locking system until I return.  Beth  (another of my friends)  Katt looks up and sees a slot that says $0.25. "We'll just come back when she's here," says Camo. So they move on. Then, they reach the arcade with me standing outside. Katt walks up and says, "So, ya got any good games?" "Sure," I say, " there's a really good one here called Dance Dance Revolution. Only $0.50!" "We'll try it," says Katt. So they try the game, over and over and over and over and over and over. After they've run out of quarters, Camo says, "Man, I must of lost at  least  ten pounds! Hey, what's that?" They go over to the prize grabber machine. "Look, Camo!" says Katt, "We can win almost every fun object in the country here!" "Yep," I say, "you can win something as small as a super ball here to something as big as a giant trampoline!" "Try it, Katt!" says Camo. The claw reaches down and grabs a small capsule. When she gets it, Katt throws it aganst the ground. As the smoke clears, only one thing can be heard....   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-

      Meet Katt Levi Tygre. She's a red cat with dark red stripes and orange hair, not to mention orange circles on her forehead and both temples. She wears a black tank top and denim shorts. Meet Camo Pyrom Tame. He's a purple chameleon with an upside-down yellow horn. His gloves have pictures of fireballs on them and his shoes have gusts of wind. One day, they decided to go to a nearby theme park run by a group of kids they know. It's called La La Land. When they got there, they went straight to the Moonrise hotel to check in. "Hey, Alec," said Camo. "Hey Camo, Katt," said AJ. "We'll be staying in the super-duper-double-deluxe ultra suite, please," says Katt. "Here's your room key." "Thanks," says Camo. The couple moves all their luggage into their room. "Come on," Katt says, "let's check out the rides and stuff!"   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-

      Pokemon Colosseum has taken over my life. The next installment of the story may not come for a while. Anyways, today I went to my dad's paintball game. I didn't know what it would be like, so I decided to watch from the sidelines. I now regret that decision. It looked awesome! My dad said I could play next time he goes paintballing. -Sane Intolerant-

      Um, let's see....  I've got it! The very first episode of:   SA2B's  GANG    Night Babylon, South Island. Inside the comedy club, we hear a comedian making fun of someone's appearance:  "Look at this guy, just look at him! I've never seen a tail like this in South Island ever! And it's  purple !" Sitting in the crowd is a chameleon with an upside-down horn. "Umm, I  really  don't think you should be making fun of him. He kinda has a short temper...." "And will you look at this hair! It like, goes up in 'V' shape! And it's green, to boot!" Suddenly, the hedgehog he was making fun of thrusts his fist in front of the guy's throat, and two claws come out of each side of his knuckles. A third one between the two comes out and goes right up against the comedian's throat (if you've ever seen X-men, remember the seen in the bar with Wolverine and the wrestling opponent? Just think of that when you read this scene). "Have you ever seen a red neck?" says the hedgehog. Meanwhile, everyone is dashing out the door. Except the purple chameleon. "Oohh, Sa2b! Every time we come here, you go and chase off another comedian! Can't we come here once without you flipping out?" "Sorry, Camo," says Sa2b, as he takes his claws away from the comedian's throat. The man then runs off. "Come on," says Camo, "before he calls the police." Sa2b and Camo vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear outside. Suddenly, someone yells, "THAT'S THEM!" The two brothers turn around to see at least four police cars. "Oh, fudge," says Camo. "They get here pretty fast, don't they?" says Sa2b.   TO BE CONTINUED...  -Sane Intolerant-

      "RUN AWAY!" the two brothers yell. As they dash away, they think about how handy it is to be able to run faster than a cheetah. "Hey, wait a minute," says Camo, "why are we running when you could just teleport us back?" "What, and ruin the fun?" says Sa2b. "There's the hotel," says Camo, "get ready to turn." "No," says Sa2b, "then they'll know where we live. Just keep running." So they pass the hotel and keep running for about 5 blocks. "Ok," says Sa2b, "now we can teleport." They both vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear inside their hotel room. "Maybe we should lay low for a while," says Camo. "Yeah, I guess. Hey, want a DP?" said Sa2b. "Yeah, sure."   2 nights later...   At 12:00 at night the phone rings. "*Yawn*, hello?" says Sa2b. "I know where your brother is," says a mysterious voice. "Yeah, he's in the bed next to me." "Wha, no, the echidna! He's being held at Area 13!" "What are you talking about?" Suddenly, Sa2b remembers a small child and a giant thunderstorm. "No way.... Thanksmangottago!" says Sa2b, and he hangs up. "Camo, Camo, get up!" "Euh, what is it?" asks Camo, sleepily. Sa2b whispers to him. "No way!" says Camo. "That's what I said. Come on!" The two teleport out of the room.   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-

       What Not to Do When Watching The Lord of the Rings    1. Stand up halfway through the movie and yell loudly, "Wait... where the heck is Harry Potter?"   2. Block the entrance to the theater while screaming: "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"   3. Play a drinking game where you have to take a sip every time someone says: "The Ring."   4. Point and laugh whenever someone dies.   5. Ask everyone around you if they think Gandalf went to Hogwarts.   6. Finish off every one of Elrond's lines with "Mr. Anderson."   7. When Aragorn is crowned king, stand up and at the top of your lungs sing, "And I did it.... MY way...!"   8. Talk like Gollum all through the movie. At the end, bite off someone's finger and fall down the stairs.   9. Dress up as old ladies and re-enact "The Battle of Helms Deep" Monty Python style.   10. When Denethor lights the fire, shout "Barbecue!"   11. In TTT when the Ents decide to march to war, stand up and shout "RUN FOREST, RUN!"   12. Every time someone kills an Orc, yell: "That's what I'm Tolkien about!" See how long it takes before you get kicked out of the theater.   13. During a wide shot of a battle, inquire, "Where's Waldo?"   14. Talk loudly about how you heard that there is a single frame of a nude Elf hidden somewhere in the movie.   15. Start an Orc sing-a-long.   16. Come to the premiere dressed as Frankenfurter and wander around looking terribly confused.   17. When they go in the paths of the dead, wait for tense moment and shout, "I see dead people!"   18. Imitate what you think a conversation between Gollum, Dobby and Yoda would be like.   19. Release a jar of daddy-long-legs into the theatre during the Shelob scene.   20. Wonder out loud if Aragorn is going to run for governor of California.   21. When Shelob comes on, exclaim, "Man! Charlotte's really let herself go!"  22. After the movie, say "Lucas could have done it better."  -Sane Intolerant-

      Here is more of my story. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a giant gargole attacks. There goes the roller coaster. Again, out of nowhere appease a popular videogame character VooDooVince. Vince takes a needle and stabs it into his head and the gargoyle runs away screaming in pain. "Well that was weird," says Sa2b, "lets go check in at the hotel." When they get to the hotel they see a familar face. It's A.J. The hotel manager from LaLa land. "hey guess what?" A.J. asks "I got a job hear because I'm the only hotel manager in this swamp meet." Later that day, Camo and Katt go talk to A.J. to find out some gossip. He tells them that there is this morphing animal in this town that is a menice to the shops. He says that it approches as a sweet little kitty cat and than it turns into a giant tiger and starts to destroy the shops. If it gets made than it will transform into a gargoyle and wreeks havoc until it calms down, then it goes away. *Camo's eyes go blank and you zoom into his pupils going into a flashback. You see a baby Camo (isn't he so cute). He is playing with a kitty cat and it morphs into a tiger and it starts to carrie camo around in its mouth. Zoom out of Camo's eyes.* Katt says "Camo whats wrong." "I don't know." Camo respondes. "Oh well, lets go out." So Camo and Katt go around the swamp meet spending time with each other, going on all the rides. After they get off the newly built roller coaster, they see a black cat, (it's so cute). Camo and Katt decide they want to keep him,(it's a boy cat), so they bring it to Sa2b to ak him. Camo: Can we keep him. Sa2b: No. Katt: Can we keep him. Sa2b: No. Camo and Katt: Can we keep him? please, we will take good care of him. Sa2b: Fine, but you have to pay for the food. Camo: Why? Sa2b: Because I pay the rent. Katt: No you don't, we don't have rent. Sa2b: Um.....ah.....shut-up. After all this, they name the cat DarkBlaze, after the legendary animal. Little did they know that the cat they picked up was actully the one and only DarkBlaze and the same cat that played with Camo when he was young. When they got home, something was amise.  Part 2 later. -Darkblaze-

      Awww, who am I kidding.   Sa2b and Camo appear in a puff of smoke outside a gate topped with barb wire. "Search lights! Move!" Camo exclaims quietly as the brothers jump out of the way. "Can you get us inside?" "Of course," says Sa2b. They both vanish in a puff of smoke.  Sa2b and Camo reappear inside, and hide instantly. "Camo, create a distraction." "Why should I when you can poof us to the end of the hall?" inquires Camo. "Too much noise, just do it. There's a reactor over there," Sa2b points out. "OK, but you owe me," says Camo, as his hands light on fire. You see, Camo had control over ice, fire, and earth. "Earth" includes plants as well. On the good side, he could combine them to make water, mist, blue fire, and quicksand. On the bad side, it made him a hydroterrapyromaniac. "FFYYYYYYYYYRRRRRRREEEE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!" screams Camo, as he blows up the reactor. Luckily, no one could hear him over the roar of the flames. As all the guards run to the explosion, the two brothers make a run for it. When they reach the room, Camo reads the sign on the door, "Weather controlling secret weapon." "That would be him," says Sa2b. They open the door and walk in.   To be continued...    OK, so it wasn't the climax. Writing the entire ending would take to much time. You're lucky you got anything at all. -Sane Intolerant-

      One day, Sa2b and the gang went on vacation, to New Orleans, since the heard about the swamp met there. When they arrived they saw none other than .GAMBIT from the X-men. Camo rushes up to him and says, Youre The raging caging arent you. Why thats right would you like an autograph Gambit responds. Camo talking in a really fast voice says, Oh,ohyes,yes,Iwouldlovetohaveanautographbyyou. *Hands Gambit a pad of paper and a pen* Who should I make this out to? To Camo Pyrom Tame. Alright, hey wait a minute, arent you the one that lit the swamps on fire last year? *Flash back: you see a lot of fire and people running around in chaos, and in the background you can see the shadow of a chameleon with a right side up horn* No that wasnt me. OK, then hear you go. *Hands back the Pen and pad of paper, now with Gambits signature on it*  To Be Continued -Darkblaze-

      They open the door and walk into the room. In the middle of the room is a large capsule which contains a red echidna with a small tuft of hair on his forehead and mittens with two clear spikes on them. "Knumchuck?" whispers Sa2b. Knumchuck is Sa2b and Camo's long-lost, blind brother with his own way of seeing. "Seems that he's asleep. How do you suppose we wake him?" says Camo. "Easy," says Sa2b, "we play with the buttons!" So, Camo and Sa2b start pressing every button they can find. Then, Sa2b notices something in the corner. "Hey, look! It's Knumchuck's retractable, all-purpose cane!" Suddenly, as he was saying that, Knumchuck's eyelids open up to reveal two, pure blue eyes. The entire room suddenly blows up, wiping out the entire base. Hours later, when the two brothers awaken, they look over and notice Knumchuck lying unconcious in the middle of what used to be the room. They pick him up and carry him out of the rubble.  *Ready, First Mate Sa2b?* *Ready, Captain Gage!* *Prepare for jump cut!* *Ay-ay, Cap'n!*  After the three got home and Knumchuck was revived, Sa2b decided to go for a walk. He passed by an alleyway and noticed a yellow, two-tailed fox with purple, white-tipped hair up in a ponytail, a black belly shirt, jeans, and black sneakers with white toes. "Hi," says Sa2b. "Hello," says the fox, "who are you?" "My name is Sa2b. What's your's?" "My name's Juliet, but they call me Foxy." "Who calls you that?" "Them," says Foxy, as she points to a tree. "The... birds call you Foxy?" "Yeah, I have this ability to talk to animals, so there basically my only friends. Oh, and also, most people I touch are in a coma within three seconds." "Well, I can teleport, I have claws that come out of my knuckles, a 15 foot tongue, the ability to change my outer form, and I control lightning and magnetism." "Wow, that's so cool!" "Hey, you want to come live with me and my brothers? It doesn't really look like you have a place to stay." "Thanks, I'd love to." "Foxy, it looks like this is the start of a beautiful relationship."  Guess who's back, Back again, S.I.'s back, With   THE END  .  And Darkblaze, I forgive you. -Sane Intolerant-

      Ya know, I have 1 day a month that I take to vent all my anger, and it was today.  All day things have gone downhill. First, when I was waking my parents they fliped out on me for no apperent reason, then in first period (spanish) I forgot some importaint papers and she fliped out on me. Math is next, I couldn't unerstand these 10 problems. They were factoring polynomials. Science, I didn't have enough information. In Tech.ED. my friend was being a hipacrite. Then lunch. Not anything new. ELT, couldn't concentrate. Language, we had a b**ch of a teacher. Almost done, last class, social, I hate that teacher. When I was walking home I ran into an old enemy, I almost killed him, but I didn't. Now I'm here talking to you people. See you later. -Darkblaze-

       SA2B's  GANG    EPISODE 2 Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty   One day, everyone was sitting around the room, bored. "Where the heck could Sa2b be?" inquires Camo. "He's been gone for quite a while," Knumchuck points out. "He'll be here soon, don't worry," Foxy says, reassuringly. Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks Sa2b. "Hey, guys, guess what?" "Oh, you mean guess what you were doing for THREE FREAKING HOURS?!?!?" exclaims Camo. "Noooo, guess where we're going!" "Where?" asks Foxy, excitedly. "We're going to DISNEY WORLD!!" screams Sa2b. "YAAAAAAAAYY!!" everyone yells. "ONWARD!" Sa2b says, as they all vanish.  Reex Cave, Subterranean Disney World Sa2b, Knumchuck, Camo, and Foxy appear in a puff of smoke. "Where are we?" Camo asks. "Dude, didn't you read the subtitles? It said we're in Reex cave, obviously a walk-through ride at this new part of the park called 'Subterranean Disney World,'" explained Sa2b, as he broke the fourth wall. "Well, let's find the exit," Knumchuck suggests. While everybody walks off, Camo is busy looking at the rock formations. "These look too real to be fake...." Suddenly, a red cat with dark red stripes wearing a black tanktop and denim shorts bumps in to Camo. "Sorry," she says. As she is saying that, Camo notices that she has orange hair, red eyes, and three orange circles on her forehead and temples. She then runs off. When Camo catches up to everyone, he asks, "Hey, did any of you see that gi-" He is cut off when Sa2b grabs the top of his head and turns it in the direction they are looking. Camo suddenly sees this huge, blue, gelatinous monster with green tentacles all over its body. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!" they all scream. The monster turns and sees them and lets out a huge roar right in thier faces. The four try to run away, but the monster grabs them and starts squeezing. You see, if serious pressure is inflicted on Sa2b and his friends, there powers have no effect.   Thenextpartwillbeveryshortbut to be contiued...  -Sane Intolerant-

      Name: Gage Web Name: Sane Intolerant Medieval Weapon of Choice: Staff Favorite Anime/Manga: Excel Saga Et Cetera Inc. rank: CEO, President, Founder  When SI first started with his SpongeBob fansite, he was a rookie. After being convinced by his friend  urlLink Mandy , he created a sort of on-line diary known as "Other Things My Site Isn't Based On." At this point, he was still a rookie. Then he introduced Sa2b. He wanted to try to make people believe Sa2b was real. He didn't really do that well. After the site was renamed to Et Cetera Inc., he admitted to Sa2b's non-existence. Now, with partners and best friends Darkblaze and Dilussional Child, he tells stories of Sa2b's Gang's exploits. He also has a thing for Rouge the Bat and Amy Rose, but he's not going to get too into that. -Sane Intolerant-

      "HOLY CRAP, HE'S GONNA EAT US!" "Thanks for pointing out the obvious, Sa2b," says Knumchuck. "Hey, look down there!" exclaims Foxy. They all look down and see a red cat. "Hey, you're the girl I saw in the last part of the story!" *Danggit, you've already burned it down and thrown its ashes into the wind! Will ya give it a rest?!* *Geez, sorry!* "Yeah, and my name is Katt. And that's the Reex." "So  that's  why it was called Reex Cave...," said Sa2b. "NO FREAKIN' DUH!!" everyone yells. "Don't worry, I'll help you!" said Katt. Suddenly, she tears out a flat section of a stalagmite and picks up a few rocks. Strange thing is, she didn't use her hands! "Hey, how are you doing that?" inquires Foxy. "I'm telekinetic." "Oh, so you can move things with your mi-" "SHUT UP!!" they all yell. Katt jumps up on the section of rock she tore off and floats up to the Reex while holding the rest of the rocks with her mind. She flings the rocks at the Reex and it lets out a roar of pain. Sa2b and company are dropped to the ground. "Thanks for saving us," says Camo. "No prob," says Katt. The Reex lets out another huge roar and everyone runs away in fear. Suprisingly, they all run at the same speed. "Hey, you wanna come back to our apartment? I don't think you want to stay here any longer...," asks Camo. "Sure, that'd be nice," says Katt, as she kisses Camo. Just before Camo accidentally trips from being distracted, Sa2b teleports them all out of the cave.

      This is my first episode I've written so I don't care if you tell me that it sux or not.  Camo! Camo!  CAMO!! Katt shouted as she ran through the hotel hall, clutching a brown paper bag. Wha AHHHH!! Camo starts to say as Katt crashes into him as he starts walk out a door. I got you something! she says, holding up the paper bag. Really?!? What? Camo asks excitedly.  New Scene! Now the couple is in the living room, with Sa2b and Foxy. Camo is holding up a bottle of mens cologne. What the heck is this? Camo asks as he reads the label. Cologne for you. I had some extra money, so I bought something for you. Do you like it? Camo reads the label.   The cologne that makes you feel and smell like a manly man! Side effects include  Camo looks at Katt with a forced smile. Lets just say my self esteem and ego have just reached 1,089. Just try it! NO!  Please? I think you should try it, Camo. Sa2b says. Me too! Foxy adds in.  Camo looks back at Katt, who is pouting her lip with a sad convincing look in her eyes. Oh, alright. Man, I hate it when she does the cute kitty face! Katt squeals, then tackle hugs Camo saying, Thank you! Camo just rolls his eyes and goes outside.  	Outside. Camo sitson the roof of the hotel and sighs. I want to make Katt happy, but does that mean I have to give up my dignity? A lot of strangers now shout out YES! Camo gets mad, jumps up and shouts back, IT WAS A RITORICAL QUESTION! He sighs again, then says, Why not? He sprays himself with the cologne and walks down the street. He starts to notice all these women are looking at him strange. When he sees a group of women stalking him down the street, he starts to run away. But they chase after him! Ahhhh! Leave me alone! I have a girl friend! Ahhhhh!  Back at the apartment. Sa2b has come home from the pharmacy where Katt got Camos present. Did you know there are side effects to this stuff? He inquires from Katt. No let me see! She looks over Sab2s shoulder and reads the side effects. Side effects may include: nausea, hallucinations, coughing, and hoards of women chasing you till you get the scent off.  What!!! Camo, wait, Ill save you from the hoards of women! Katt runs to the door and picks up a conveniently placed wooden stick that is leaning against the wall.  Im coming for you Camo?!? Katt stutters off as Camo rushes in the living room where he lies down on the couch, exhausted from running around the entire city. Katt looks to Camo then to the hoards of women coming down the street. Ahhhh! Katt screams as she proceeds to run towards the hoards of women with the stick. (Skip the next few scenes *insert rave or elevator music*) Camo, Im sorry. Will you forgive me? Katt asks Camo, starting to pout her lip. Alright! Just dont do it again! Camo shouts. Foxy comes behind Camo and pours a bucket of water over his head. What the Why! He starts to chase Foxy all over the apartment. I was only trying to help! She shouts back at him. So ends this story! ~toodles~ -Dilussional Child-

      I see you've met DC. I just have a few things to tell her:  1. For cripes sakes, calm down! 2. No, you're not supposed to be on Darkblaze's site. 3. Now that you've made it clear, I think it's safe to assume you're obsessed with InuYasha. 4. You'll be familiar with my characters as we go along. 5. I'm glad you like my posts! 6. Lighten up with the edited profanity, please.  Anyaways, Yesterday I went to Kiss Concert 2004. I missed Frickin'' A (DANGGIT!). Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5, and Ja Rule (whom restored my faith in Hip-Hop) are officially some of the coolest bands/singers out there. My mind was "somewhat" pure before JC Chasez came out (let's just say I think he's turning Japanese). We heard at least 2 songs  by Jessica Simpson before we left (I could see her mouth from where I was sitting, and I was sitting pretty darn far away). And all the while, I was sitting in the smoking section (lungs... burning...). It was a pretty good concert. -Sane Intolerant-

      Sorry for the lack of updates from me. Many things contributed:  1)Homework 2)Homework 3)An awesome new anime called "Azumanga Daioh" 4)Ordered an Excel Saga DVD  To make up for it, I bring you:   SA2B's  GANG    Episode 4 "The Pheonix Cometh"  One night, everyone was calmly sleeping in their beds, when suddenly the wall bursts open (Useless fact: this is the first time this has happened)! Everyone is thrown from their beds to the opposite wall. "What in the frick was that?" asks Sa2b. "That would be me," said a mysterious voice from within the smoke. "And you would be?" inquires Camo. "SHUT UP! I was getting to that. My name," says the voice, as a giant robot housing a red-striped orange weasel steps out of the smoke,"is MACK!" "Corrnyyy..." Katt says, under her breath. "Say that again and I'll make your death even slower and more painful than originally!" says Mack. But before Sa2b and friends can react, the robot explodes from behind and Mack is sent flying into the sky. "Okay, stereotypical bad guy phrase. Umm... CURSE YOOU!!" Mack yells. As the dust clears, a large flaming bird is seen with a lone figure inside of it, and then flies off. While everyone wonders exactly what just happened, Knumchuck has a perfect understanding of it.   To be continued...   Today's episode has been brought to you by Dr. Pepper, the special effects budget of Et Cetera Inc.! -Sane Intolerant-

      I see you have deleted your site Darkblaze. Anyways, even though SI is working through a story, I'm gonna type a short story about LALALAND! and stuff.    Typical Day in Lalaland.        I'm sitting at the rollarcoasters engine, trying to figure out what to do to make it even faster than it already is, when I see Alec, who runs the hotel, run very fast past me. I quirked my eyebrow, and walked in the opposite direction from which Alec was running. I see that all my fellow co-workers and friends are standing in front of a blazing inferno *KOOOOL!* Then I relized that it was a fire of fun and prettiness *which it usually is* and that it is actually the hotel. I knew know one else was there at the moment, cause it's MCAS time, dont cha know, and that people weren't burning alive. Erm. Anyways, I turned to Mandy, who runs the gift shop and asked "What happened here?!!??!?!?" She doesn't answer me, so I turn to my friend Gage, who runs the tea shop, and see him stareing at Alec, who as just run back with a strange looking charactar by the collar. "Fix this, Camo!" Camo, the weird guys name, (Camo: I am not weird!!! Me: Shut up *throws random object...and misses*)says with an attitude, "And what if I don't wanna?" Alec gives him a serious look and says in a stern voice, "Then I'll make you face Katt on DDR 1 million google times." Camo looks horror stricken then, and fianlly gives in and says, "Fine!" I stood back and watched Camo laugh manically as he put the flames out and Gage rolling his eyes, saying under his breath, "Pryo/hydromaniacs..." I saw that the entire hotel was burnt to a crisp. "Bye!" Camo shouted, just as the hotel re-appeared again *POOF!* only, this time it was green. So, at the end of the day, we all went back to our jobs, and I just tried and tried to figure out the rollarcoasters guts spilled out all over the floor. The end! PS-Camo is not the antagonist in the story. He's like both! (protagonist I meam)  -Dilussional Child-

      OMG WE'LL MISS YOU DC! *Gives hug, DC backs away slowly.* Remember, call me and Darkblaze when you get there, come down for Christmas (Which, coincidentally, is after my birthday. I expect presents *shakes fist, DC backs away more*.) Here's a going away gift. It's not material, so I understand if you hate me for the rest of eternity *mimes tear, DC backs away yet again*.  Oh, crap, where did I leave off? Hmmm... oh, right. Ahem:  You see, since Knumchuck was blind, his other senses got stronger ("*coughDaredevilripoffcough*" "Shut it!"). And he could "see" who the person was ("*coughlawsuitcough*" "I said SHUT IT!!"). It was a female echidna with blue hair, wearing a dress. But, for the sake of my storytelling skills, he didn't tell anyone.  THE NEXT DAY!  Knumchuck wakes up, and when he gets up first thing in the morning, his powers don't work too well. The other day he stuck a Pop-tart in a blender and tried to make a fruit smoothie with the toaster. Today, he accidentally shoved cereal into his nose. But none of that has anything to do with the storyline. I just added it in for length. So he's walking down the street and (WARNING! STORY LENGTHENER AHEAD!) trips over a manhole cover with the initials "FW" on it. He opens it and sees me effortlessly typing away at my computer. So he notices a female echidna with blue hair and a blue dress walking down the street carrying a large bag of groceries and a blazing red bird on her sholder. She loses her balance and almost drops her groceries, had it not been for Knumchuck who saved them at the last second. "Thanks," said the blue-haired echidna. "Hey, it's the least, and I mean the least, I could do for the person who saved me and my friend's lives," Knumchuck answers. "You knew that was me?" "Of course I did. I don't have these super senses for nothing. 'Cept today. I shoved cereal up my nose and it temporarily impaired my sense of smell." "Hehehehe. My name's Pheen. Pheen Niks. This is my pet bird Pheonix." "I'm Knumchuck. Nice to meet you."   TEH END!!!  -Sane Intolerant-

      Where'd I leave off? Oh yeah...Goku is a like a monkey demon and he was imprisoned for commiting a really bad crime(like what mike would do to me if I plastered he loves 'M' on the internet for the world to see, only much worse) and Sanzo saved him. His demon restricter, so he looks human and is sane, is that crown thing he wears all the time so he doesn't kill everyone in sight, including friends. Then there is the unorthodox monk Sanzo. He is at the highest rank of monk there is. He is constantly threatening to shoot people and for comic reief, hits Goku and Goyjo. Next is Goyjo himself(mental drool and anime fall)I MEANT TO DO THAT! Um, yeah, well Goyjo is half demon, a water sprite to be exact, and he is with the group to find his brother who saved him from his mother who tried to kill him. *AWWWWW!!!!* But he is a womanizer, and drinker, a gambler, and a smoker, so with the hottness comes that bad stuff =(. And last but not least there is Hakkia. He is a unnateral demon cause he became a demon after he killed like 1000 demons to get to the woman he loved. But she killed herself. More on that later. But Hakkia is very brotherly, and has an ADORABLE pet dragon that Darkblaze would love. But I'm guessing D will not be on for a while because we just got our report cards and....*gets shoe thrown at her* Ah! Bye! -Dilussional Child- (ps I'm leaving tomorrow. BYE i'll mis you all! *insert Hulk ending theme here, from the old shows*)

      Don't worry. Once I've finished introducing all the characters, you can write a story. 10 out of the first 11 episodes are the introductions. Eps 12-33 are just the crazy antics of Sa2b's Gang. 34 is the ep leading up to the season finale. 35 is when the first season ends and the second one begins. That's basically the outline. -Sane Intolerant-

      I have expanded my manga collection rapidly since the last time anyone heard about it. On the DC trip, I got Excel Saga Vol. 1. Later, when I got back home, I got Excel Saga Vol. 6 and Azumanga Daioh Vol. 2. My mom ordered Excel Saga Vol. 3, 4, and 5, so I got those too. Then today I went to Barnes and Noble and got Azumanga Daioh Vol. 1 and Steel Angel Kurumi Vol. 1. I would've gotten Excel Saga Vol. 7, but they didn't have it. *Cries.* *Sob,* so I'm hoping that I might find it and buy it while we're in Maine, which, may I add, we're going to tomorrow.

      OK, Excel Saga episode 22 is up, and it won't make sense to anyone who isn't a complete Mobile Suit Gundam fanatic. It is very confusing, stereotypical, and has a lot of Puchuu that no one has even seen before. It just drops you into events and introduces new characters in a way that makes it seem like we know them already. Weird, huh?  -Sane Intolerant-

      Dang, how long has it been? I've  got  to be overdue for a new episode of  Sa2b's  Gang  ... oh, well. Tonight I'm gonna tell you about some new teams that will have their own episodes soon:   Cybe   R.   Team     This group consists of 5 heroes who went to Sa2b's Gang for counseling after gaining thier own powers. Members include:  Cybe R. Teknik- A hedgehog whose robot arms house and array of weapons, including the extremely powerful Cyber Flash  Jane Strechel- A hedgehog who gained a pink elastic body in a lab accident that involved silly putty  Pyde Arak- An armadillo with powers like Spider-Man, except that the webs come from his fingertips  Giette Armour- A hedgehog with organic armor, plus her own sword and shield  William "B.B." Blayne/The Snarl- Think of him as a 7-year-old version of the Hulk  But that's only one team. Here's the second:    H unting    P ack     Nightshade- A liger born on the shadowy side of the Tree of Eternal Light and Darkness, he has complete command over the world of the shadows. He sometimes gets a little carried away, though...  Slyless- A wolf with a knack for escaping from a locked room with nothing but a toothpick and a bottle cap. She also has powers of seduction and can make any man fall for her  Leo- A liger born on the brink of the Tree of Eternal Light and Darkness and the twin brother of Nightshade. The hair spikes on the back of his head are removable, very sharp (thanks to the wonders of SuperGel), and he can hit a target dead on. He was also gifted with amazing strength  Gust- A coyote who spent most of her life in the section of the woods near the DiscoRama Dance Center. Therefore, she is very 70's-oriented, right down to her hairstyle. She has the ability to go feral  Vladamir XIII- A vampire bat who spent most of his life in a clock tower, feeding on the blood of the livestock that are are shipped by. He has powers of flight and hypnosis.  All members of Hunting Pack have retractable claws in their fingers, speed, and super senses, as well as being nocturnal.  Well, that's all folks! look for stories about these teams in the future.  -Sane Into  lerant-      DR, if you want to put the last names for Hunting Pack, that'd be great. If you do, erase this bottom message.
