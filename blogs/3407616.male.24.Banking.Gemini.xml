      Good morrow kind people.   I have to suspend the usual light-hearted tone of this blog for this entry, as I have just had a  blazing  row with my bank. I mean it was truly  immense . For reasons apparent in "Errm... I take it all back!", I can't name the bank and this only serves to make me  BLOODY FURIOUS . And I really wasn't exactly "in love" with my bank before this. In fact, it would be true to say that every opportunity I have to taint their name, I seize with both hands. I am an anti-publicist; I give PR people a reason to be employed by my bank.  By this point, I think you understand that I'm just a leeetle upset.  So, my Bank. I had my cash card reissued on Tuesday. A normal, everyday occurrence. Now, on previous experience, this involves nothing more than some light Plastic mutilation of your old card when you get the new one.   Oh no.  Not this time.  I get the new card, I hack the old card to bits with scissors, a razorblade and a shredder. I put the new card in my wallet, satisfied by its lovely shininess and the way its' hologram glints seductively in the warm dusk sunlight, pausing only briefly to scrawl my signature on it in my almost blasphemous way. I think no more of it.  I go to Asda today, to purchase my lunch consisting of Chicken Passanda and Tricolour Rice (sum total £1.70, guaranteed to get moans from your co-workers about the smell). I go to the cash point, slide my shiny (and, I have to admit it,  sexy ) card out of my wallet, insert it gently into the cash-giving slot and enter my pin. Oops, wrong number, so I try again. Wrong again. Hmmm... I've been in this situation before so I don't assume that I'm being an idiot (valid assumption though that would be), and withdraw the card. Its' hologram glints in a slightly shame-faced way.  At this point, I have a sneaking suspicion that my bank have changed my pin without telling me. Fury and rage race each other across the landscape of my mind, as the dawn of realisation chases them, all three competing to be the first to reach the point of my mind called "Those  bastards  have done it again!"  I call the bank, end up in India (obviously). As I said, I am not overly chuffed with my bank at the moment anyway, so the problem with the card that sat in my wallet primed with promise and delivering only an empty, aching feeling (as well as the hunger, ok? I was hungry  and  I had an empty aching. I know the difference, dammit!) has only served to wind me   right   up. Needless to say, waiting on the line listening to the music chosen  especially  to wind people up and put them off calling, I was like a feral cat put in a box and shaken - bloody furious.  She answered the phone, and I went off like a claymore mine.  I'm not proud. She was a very nice lady (who spoke excellent English, I'll have you know), who didn't know what had hit her, and she really did not deserve that. I asked to speak to someone higher up after apologising profusely, and she put me through to my branch. (As a small aside, any calls to my bank that end up in India and are then routed on to the UK  are still sent via India!  This means that there was a delay of perhaps two or three seconds before the guy two miles away answered me. This irked me somewhat).  The phone was answered finally by Steve. Steve, if you're reading this, be warned,  I'm not finished yet, oh, not by a looooooooong way!! . My opening gambit was "Right, here's the situation, I am absolutely LIVID because the waste of space that is  ---bank's name deleted cos I'm not giving them the satisfaction of suing---  has screwed up again by..."  "Sir, don't call me a waste of space. Do you want to carry on this conversation?" "  WHAT??!!  " "Do you want to want to carry on this conversation or am I going to be forced to put the phone down on you?" "PUT THE PHONE DOWN ON ME?? I'll force you to bloody eat that ****ing phone in a minute you irritating company-boy who secretly dreams of being rogered by the bank manager whilst fellating the chairman of the board and being used as a doormat for the bank's entrance hall! You have no idea of a) customer service and b) how to diffuse a tense situation! You mother must be ASHAMED of you!!" I narrowly avoided replying. Instead, I said: "I. Have. Not. Insulted you. I. Expressed. My opinion. Based. On recent. And. Long. Term. Experience. I. Was. Very. Careful. Not. To. Insult. Anyone. Working. For. The. Bank." "But sir, I represent the bank. By insulting the bank, you insult me. I will not listen to such insults. Are you going to be reasonable, or am I going to finish this conversation now?" (Bit of a shocker, him saying that he represents the bank, eh? They usually don't want any association with the bank  at all  if it means the situation will calm down) "Steve, Stop it. Stop it now, listen to my problem or I will drive up to the branch  right now  and we can discuss it in person. I'm in my car now,  don't  make me come up there, or so help me GOD there will be trouble. Now, are you going to listen?"  Steve listened, completely failing to A) apologise, b) attempt to diffuse the situation c) sort the problem out d) keep his job if I have anything to do with it.  So, the upshot of all this is that I didn't get my chicken passanda, instead being treated to a starter of Mild Confusion on a bed of Warm Irritation, followed by a Main Course of Anger, Frustration and Disbelief Pie with a side order of Utter Loathing. I skipped dessert.  All in all, I'm a bit peckish now. Which really does nothing to improve my mood at all. Why me, eh? It's not fair. I'm a nice guy, I help little birds (a nod at this point Small-Elf Sized One), I give to charity every month. What did I do in a former life?   Answers on a post card...

      I have often mused upon the effect the weather has on our behavior. Well, I  say  "often", in fact I  mean  I was wondering just now but I've found that it sounds better if the subject you're discussing seems to have been considered over a long time, with reference perhaps to reliable sources of information and further due research rather than the  actual  case of my just having finished gazing out of the window in a semi-stupor of fatigue and sleeplessness.  So, I was just thinking about the effect the weather has on us, and I was sent down this rambler's path because today can't make up its' mind if it wants to be sunny, or overcast, or chilly, or pleasantly warm. Every time the sun has broken through, my mood has lifted. The squirrels outside my window merrily cavorted across the grass, the Green Woodpecker merrily taps out its' tattoo of warning to the bugs buried deep in the trunks of trees, and the foliage wafts gently in a early summer zephyr. I feel warm, optimistic, and spurred on by nature's rich bounty.  Then the clouds roll back with an oppressive and almost audible thump. The squirrels run away as if they've just heard a KP lorry has overturned down the road, the green woodpecker disappears (allowing the bugs to breathe a sigh of relief) and foliage stops wafting and starts waving angrily like a person whose hair has an irresistible attraction for wasps. I see this, and my depression crashes upon me, smothering my creative talent(!) and seriously impairing my appetite. Which, for me, is a major event. Ask the small-elf sized one, she can't  believe  how much I can eat.   Weather, eh? And foreigners wonder why we have an obsession with it, when it does this kind thing to us. Of course, my mood fluctuations could be nothing to do with the weather, but the doctor said that the lithium should have stopped the  other  problem.

      A person very close to my heart (it's a small elf, living in my inside jacket pocket. Well, maybe not living in my pocket, so much as living 170 miles away, but she  is  small-elf sized)has pointed out that I could be  strung up by my vitals courtesy of a huge corporate entity who may, or may not, use the letters "G" and "L" in the pursuit of their normal business. Everyone should bear in mind that these ramblings are purely those of a slightly maniacal person with slightly sub-standard IQ and mad cow disease. Any opinions expressed here are mere my own warped, twisted and skewed ideas arrived by mental processes similar to those of an axe murderer in Texas shortly  after  they flick the switch to that comfy chair with the leather straps.   In short,  I'm really really sorry, L&G, you  can  be trusted and are an excellent company all round.    Look, I know it might be a sell-out to the corporate oppressors, but hey, it's  my  ass on the line!  Oh, yeah, while I remember, Moo. There, see? I'm completely mad. Utterly out of my box, and completely  not  worth suing at all. Or committing, now I think about it, because is not so much madness as a bizarre eccentricity which is utterly harmless yet leads me to ramble (apparently coherently) whilst failing to bother intelligent thought at all. Moo. See, there I go again. Ho ho. Me, eh? What  am  I like?

      Well, this weekend was full of computers, racing, fatigue and laziness. All in all, a pretty standard event. The Monaco Grand Prix was excellent, and I hate to admit it but I spent the majority of the race  desperately  hoping, willing, praying and telepathically manipulating events so that Schumacher wouldn't win. And, what can I say, he didn't. Beware world: Mortgageman has mental abilities  beyond mere human comprehension!!   Oh, on a completely random note,  a word to the wise: Don't trust Legal & General. They're  awful .  Enough from me for now, management are looking over my shoulder.... Bye!

      Well, hello there. This is a Blog which is, in fact, utterly pointless. I kind of drifted towards the "insight into the industry" thang, skipped briefly past the "Personal side of a mortgage guy" and arrived resolutely at the "What the  HELL  am I bothering for?" shop, gazing in through the plate glass window of despair on my own existence and thinking that there really isn't much worth looking at...   So, anyway, here it begins and hopefully something meaningful will arise from it. Any comments, questions and general abuse would be... um... well, ignored probably, but it's worth a go.

      Hello followers.  Well, I call you followers, but only in the sense that you follow what I put in this Blog. I don't want you to all treat me as God though, that would be really embarrassing. I'd have to start wearing a white sheet, and growing a long beard and sounding really wise. I'm quite happy sounding a bit odd, slightly maniacal and often as if I'm under the influence of some particularly interesting mushrooms growing just outside my office window, you know the ones, they've got the elephants running around on them.  Hmmm, having reread that, I think it best if I start again.  Hey Everybody ( Hi Doctor Nick )!!  SO, this weekend, I was in that ever-popular summertime destination, Nottingham. Yes, I know, this is the second Blog entry in a row involving Nottingham, but what can I do about it? Everything that is interesting in my life happens up there. I am a boring old git, and it is only the frisson (I'm sure there should be an accent on that somewhere) of Old Git meets Young Hip Town which generates anything even remotely worth reading. Want proof? Read the first three blog entries. There, how rubbish were  they ? Point proven, I think.  Anyway, I was in Nottingham and had a rubbish day on Saturday. But before we get to that, I need to fill you in on some background.  It was my birthday a short while ago, and one of presents from SESO (Small-Elf Sized One, for all those who didn't read the previous blog entires, you lazy so-and-so's, drop me an email and I'll come to your house scroll your mouse for you to if you want me to) was the Itchy Guide to Nottingham. The guide is a cool little book which gives a few sentences on some choice venues (bars, clubs, pubs, restaurants) to allow the uninitiated to wander around the town and avoid the real dives. I assumed that since SESO had given me the book, she had already checked it for accuracy and that I could treat it as my Nottingham Bible.  That was probably a mistake.  So, I am pressurised now to choose an activity because SESO is fed up with having to decide what we're going to do, hence her buying Itchy for me. For Saturday afternoon I chose going to the caves underneath the Broadmarsh centre and so the dire day begins. Apparently they are unique and hand-carved (don't mention Fort Amhurst in Chatham which are also "Hand Carved and Unique!") and, I quote, "You haven't done Nottingham until you've done the caves!". Understandably, with such a sweeping statement, I was keyed up for the excitement offered by being fifty feet underground.   Whooo hooo.  Itchy said the caves closed at 5pm on Saturdays, and so we wandered over there at around ten past four, thinking that we would have enough time to mooch round and enjoy the excitement without needing the toilet like a wound-up three year old.   It was closed.   My world collapsed. I had carefully read through the entire of Itchy, committing it to memory, having ideas of great evenings in Tantra (which, incidentally, is a really really good place to be), of enjoying the views offered by the Cornerhouse, of boogying on down in Dogma.   But alas, my entire belief system, solidly grounded on Itchy, came crumbling down when I discovered that   Itchy had got it wrong!!!   I was stunned. I was speechless, my head hung low on my shoulders as I tried to comprehend the enormity of the situation. SESO accused me of sulking like the aforementioned three year old. Neerrrr to that.  So, we decided that we didn't care, and instead went to Smiling Sam's. The suggestion was made, the experience was painted vividly in mental pictures of garish lights, token-eating arcade machines, the laughter of happy adults who'd regressed to their childhood. It sounded fantastic.  The drive was interminable, especially as I don't know Nottingham very well and was taking directions from SESO. "Are we nearly there yet?"  "No." "Are we nearly there yet?" "No." "Where am I going?" "Right (gesturing left)." "This right? The right known by everyone else as... left?" "Yes. Shut up and stop laughing at me."  And finally, after a few miles of this (and some mild contusions), we cruise past a huge derelict warehouse. I dismiss it; our destination is apparently just down the road from Imperial Tobacco and the area is pretty grim. I assume the warehouse just another part of "Ee, it's grim oop north".  SESO lets out a gasp of horror. "Look!" I glance to where she's indicating, expecting to see a dead body, or part of a dead body, or a dying body. Instead, I see the derelict warehouse. Mild confusion settles on the familiar surroundings of my face.  "Smiling Sam's has closed down!" This was said with the gravitas, the enormity of announcements like, "Elvis is dead." or "The kidney has been rejected."  There was a wailing and a gnashing of teeth, mainly because for the second time that day I had been deeply, deeply disappointed by Nottingham. Not disappointed in a "Oh, that's a pity" way, more in a "I had the winning lottery ticket where the triple rollover jackpot was £200,000,000, and I gave it to a tramp" kind of way. I was crushed.  "Cruel Nottingham, why do you treat me this way? WHY???"  So we went and watched deer in Woolaton Park instead. E, that were grand. Except when the Iranian tourist held his eighteen-month old child out to stroke the (wild) stag with antlers protruding from his head of sufficient size to be able to find homes for the entire 21-man "Sombrero Sala-men"'s hats. I did say "I really don't think that's a good idea".   The kid only got headbutted and was screaming like a good-un, so was probably ok. Unfortunately, the Dad didn't get gored to death as befits an eedjit harassing a fully-grown deer in the calving season.   I dunno, you just don't get as many gorings as you used to.  On another note, the weather was actually really nice for the whole weekend and it didn't rain. I had to sit down for five minutes when I realised that.  I came over all funny.

      Well, here we are on the Tuesday after the bank holiday, and I  swear  that my head still isn't right after the weekend. Allow me to expand. This may take a while.  I spent this weekend visiting Small-Elf Sized One in Nottingham. Now, for the uninitiated, Nottingham consists mainly of a fantastic town populated with friendly people who sometimes try just a  leeeetle  too hard. You know the sort, people who think that they're significantly better looking than they are, people who try to look like they're in boy bands, people who are clearly desperate but have no concept of subtlety. In short, people who try to look like the Beckhams but with none of the talent, money, looks, charisma, or popular interest.   So, Nottingham's a great place. It's also got about 3 women to every man, which is useful for some. I of course have Small-Elf Sized One, and she is all the woman I could ever want. However, this didn't stop ladies eyeing  me  up. This is unheard of, and in itself suggests that them "ooop noorth" are perhaps labouring under slightly misguided concepts of attractiveness. I am, as they say, not so much an "Oil Painting" as an "Oil Slick". But anyway.   At the weekend, I went out in Nottingham with my beloved. And got very, very drunk. The reason is as follows.   One of Small-Elf Sized One's friends is Australian. And can drink like no-one I have ever met before, except perhaps my old boss who was  HUGE , which meant the alcohol simply never touched enough of the sides of him to have an effect. The Australian, however, is a good-looking young man who has the kind of glint in his eye which gets every lady in the room, even those of femalephillic orientation, looking thoughtfully in his direction. I was next to him for the majority of the evening, while he was drinking first a bottle of wine (to himself, of course) followed by perhaps eight double JD & Cokes. Ouch.  I was being cajoled into keeping up with him, and I was making a valiant effort. I managed to match him 1 single JD & coke for every 2 Double JD & coke he was drinking. I got very drunk, very quickly. He just sat and laughed scathingly, as if his opinion of the entire British culture was relying solely on my capacity for drink, and I had let the entire country and eons of history down. I felt that Sir Walter Raleigh was hanging his head in shame, that Winston Churchill was giving me the fingers, that Brunel was planning a behemoth machine to erase my pitiful existence from the face of the planet.   I may have been overreacting slightly.  Nevertheless, my defence stands that it was my first night's drinking this year, so my liver was particularly stunned to see alcohol again. I think it recognised an old friend, and as some acquaintances are want to, it didn't want to see any of the treasured liquid leave and so held on to it for far too long, until the alcohol was hanging around my body having metaphorically seen the last six years' holiday photos, holiday videos and the slide shows which it really didn't enjoy but had to feign interest, conscious of the knowledge that it wasn't getting out until it's mate Liver said so.  In English, I was feeling a bit worse for wear.  At this point, when my reason had left in disgust at alcohol's incarceration by my liver, when Balance was something to be fondly remembered as one remembers a pleasant meal some years previously, when my judgement was as sound as that which released OJ Simpson, Small-Elf Sized One suggested going to a Gay club. At this point, my liver took over: "Club, Hurruh! More of my good old friend Alcohol! Yay!", whilst my mind (now merely a small whisper at the edge of hearing) said "Gay? Ummm, perhaps we should be considering the  Gay  implications of this? Hello? Oh dear. This can't be good."  So I end up in this Gay club, having shed the Aussie Tormentor. I go in with Small-Elf Sized One, her friend Tom, and Tom's boyfriend. We get in the door, and I SWEAR the entire club erupted to calls of "Tom! Small-Elf Sized One (not her real name obviously, but I'm protecting the innocent here)! How are you?". I panicked. Tom was swamped, Small-Elf Sized One disappeared in a huge heaving mincing pile of campness, and I was left standing next to Tom's boyfriend (note - he's gay, for the hard-of-thinking among you) who turned to me slowly and said, "I'm really,  really  scared now."  Needless to say, this did not fill me with confidence.  Eventually, after much questions of "Oh, oh, new man on the scene! Small-Elf Sized One, do you know who he is? He's nice!" and responses of "Yes, that would be  my  boyfriend."  Then, SESO meets her friend Paul, whilst Tom's boyfriend and I are standing next to each other trying to look as inconspicuous as two men standing closely together in a gay club can do. Paul looks over, after being told my name and Tom's boyfriend's name. He looks at me, looks at Tom's boyfriend. "Are you two married then?"  Both me and Tom's boyfriend splutter, laugh in disbelief, then turn and look at each other with a slightly indignant look on our faces. "Why  wouldn't  you be married to me, huh? What's Wrong with me?" we both think. Paul then proceeds to look at me more closely, up and then down, then back up again. His gaze lingers disconcertingly at my crotch for just a moment, then turns to SESO and in the campest, most provocative voice I have  ever  heard says...  "Aww, he's  cute ! Let me know when you're finished with him!"  I went straight to the bar and carried on what the Aussie had started in me, I proceeded to order a double JD & Coke and drink it to steady my nerves. Needless to say, it only had the effect of unsteadying my feet.  I later found out that that particular club is one of   the  most intimidating, overwhelming and full-on gay clubs in Nottingham, the type of club that most Gay men find OTT. No wonder I was nervous.  Apart from that, I had a fantastic time. Actually,  including  that I had a fantastic time, it just seemed a little odd to me at the time. Gay men commenting on my bum has up until now been something which simply didn't happen, so when it does it's hard not to be flattered but it's also hard not feel odd about it.   Anyway, it was all good and no-one tried to kiss me except SESO, which is good.   Other stuff happenend too, but that only involved SESO and her best friend in their underwear in my car, and that's  far  too vulgar to discuss in public.

      Hello dear Bloggers,   I know I have failed to update for a while, but alas, I've been... umm... saving the world from... umm... a giant squid-thing... with my guitar... err. Yes, ok, we all know that's a video for a Darkness song. Alright, I've done nothing of interest since my last post because I'm just a bizarre combination of crap and unpopular, although now I think about it the two may well go hand in hand...    So moving on from that suicide-inducing train of thought, I just had to update you all on my life so far. I've done things, seen things that mere mortals can only  dream  of... Or pay £40 to see, at any rate. My most recent outing of note was to the Goodwood Festival of Speed. And it was fantastic! I stood on a Formula 1 car (accidentally, I might add; Had I not stepped on it's nosecone then I would have gone flying into the running engine and we  all  know what sort of hell  that  can be), I got deafened, I saw the Bentley LeMans racer, I got deafened, I saw the Paris-Dakar Rally Trucks (they're  HUGE ), I got deafened... I think you can spot a theme running through this. The day was rather loud, but immense fun.  Apart from that, I'm a bit dry really. Had I written this immediately afterwards I could have furnished you with all the detail and colour (note spelling, Americans among you) which my Blog has come to represent, but I was too lazy and hence didn't do it.   Well, I'm helping to move SESO a third of the way across the country at the weekend, so no doubt there will be some mirth generated there (though I have a sneaky suspicion that I won't be laughing much at the time). Blog later dudes.
