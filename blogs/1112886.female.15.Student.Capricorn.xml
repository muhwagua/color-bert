      lyrics to the best song in my vocal range: Bring Me to Life    how can you see into my eyes, like open doors leading you down into my core where I've become so numb without a soul my spirit sleeping somewhere cold until you find it there and lead it back home  [Chorus] wake me up inside, wake me up inside call my name and save me from the dark bid my blood to run, before I come undone save me from the nothing I've become  now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me breathe into me and make me real bring me to life  [Chorus]  bring me to life  frozen inside without your touch, without your love, darling only you are the life among the dead  all this time I can't believe I couldn't see kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems got to open my eyes to everything without a thought, without a voice, without a soul don't let me die here there must be something more  [Chorus] I've been living a lie there's nothing inside bring me to life

      o ya. if u havnt guessed already, inviting me to the two towers would probably b a bad idea as i probably cannot go. and getting me very excited to see the movie and then my parents spoiling my fun would b very bad for my at the moment pretty happy mood. inviting me to the concert however, is a VERY good idea and i suggest it.

      hey, does ne1 wanna see the two towers this weekend? call me. i'm a lotr mood. and if ne1 gets tix to the 104.9 concert on the 24 of jan., u can call me too. does anyone no the number u hafta call to win the tix? my mom has been nagging me to clean my room. mayb i'll do that. i also hav two bajillion things to do for homework. for example: study for math test, study for oral part of french final, memorize lines for dramatization and two plays, english essay, and study for history test. i also hafta do all the history homework i havnt done for the past week. the closet needs to be cleaned, the made must b made. i hafta change and shower. i need to wash my clothes. make a new cd with all the good songs that i'v discovered recently, find my script for one of the plays i'm supposed to memorize (altho, i suspect it mite b in reno), and i need to update my calendar. i still hav a puppy calendar up from 2002, november 2002 is up rite now cuz i'm so up to date. i need to cut out all the pics of elijah wood that i'v been saving for the weekend, and i need to figure out how to sew a cape. hopefully a velvet cape. however at the rate i'm going, its probably going to b made of garbage bags (as my ring wraith costume was). do u see how busy i am? ne1 wanna cum over and help. the good news is, the basketball game was canceled so i hav an extra hour. i dont think i could go neway. my legs r so sore from running so much yesterday. i'm so out of shape i'm gonna walk the dog. yesterday i walked three rounds of the block so that i could pass those hot high school football players a bunch of times. my poor puppy was so tired when he got back, he refused to move until i carried him to his water dish. i spoil him.

      ooooo!!!! sarrah shouted out (or watever the verb form of shout out) is. kewl. i shout out to sexyhornofgondor, frodofreak, yourlateor, and other ppl that sarrah wrote on her shout out list. cuz i'm sure i no u. i'll find out who u r. unless u feel like revealing urself to me. yes, i'm talking to u stubbleupdate and PervyHobbitfancier. to tell u the truth, i can guess who u r. stubbleupdate is probably chrissy or sum1 (i thought of that name for u) and Pervy must be anj. she's the pervyest person i no. and that's pretty pervy cuz sexyhornofgondor follows closely behind in second.

      ppl, i'd greatly appreciate it if u took a look at my essay on to kill a mockingbird and mayb correct it. its due tuesday (my bday). jest email miss_purple89@yahoo.com with the essay copied and pasted in it. thanx!!! here it is:  Essay Topic #1						Rekha Arulanantham 								December 15, 2002 								Period 6  Courage  	A theme of the book, To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee is courage. Throughout the narrative, Scout, the main character, encounters several kinds of courage. Three major types shown in Harper Lee’s novel are the courage to stand up for what a person knows and believes in, the courage to stay calm in a tough situation, and the courage to always do the right thing. 	Sticking up for something one knows and believes in is a key form of courage. Two people showed this quality in To Kill a Mockingbird. One of these people was Tom Robinson during the trial. Even though he said things people did not want to hear, he always told the story how it happened. During one part of the trial, Tom admitted something that the white community thought was ghastly. He admitted that he felt sorry for a white person, Mayella Ewell. It was atrocious for a black person to pity a white person, no matter how rich or poor either of them were. Even though people did not want to hear this, Tom told what he knew. The other person who also possessed this type of courage was the Cunningham who was a juror for the trial. This man helped stall the verdict by standing up for Tom and what he believed in. Although this Cunningham’s opinion was only one person’s belief and there were eleven other jurors with differing ideas, he did not let the prejudices of a small southern town interfere with his judgment. 	Another type of courage is the ability to stay calm. In the book, Miss Maudie and Scout showed this quality. In chapter eight, Miss Maudie’s house burns down and all of her belongings were destroyed. She had nothing left. She responded to this event with optimism. Instead of worrying about her possessions and home, she seemed pleased.  “Miss Maudie looked around, and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face. ‘Always wanted a smaller house, Jem Finch. Gives me more yard. Just think, I’ll have more room for my azaleas now!’ ” (72-73)   Scout showed bravery similar to Miss Maudie’s. In one of the most important scenes in the book, Scout and Jem are attacked by an unknown assailant. Fortunately, she was wearing a costume that protected her from the man trying to murder her. However, she was stuck in the costume and could not get out to protect herself, much less find out what was going on. Unlike most nine-year-olds, she stayed calm, mostly out of confusion, and made enough observations to later determine who the aggressor was and how she and her brother were saved.	 The most important kind of courage in the book was to always know and do the right thing.  “It’s when you know you’re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.” (112)   This is what Atticus said after the death of Mrs. Dubose. Mrs. Dubose knew she was dying, but she wanted to get rid of her addiction to morphine before she passed on. Atticus also showed this characteristic. Because of discrimination against blacks during the time, Atticus knew that he could not win the case; the jury would side with a white witness as opposed to a black one no matter what the circumstances were. He also knew that all people deserve a lawyer who believed they were innocent until proven guilty, even if the person was black. 	The ideas of the courage to follow one’s knowledge and beliefs, the courage to stay calm in the most dreadful circumstances, and the courage to do the right thing no matter what, made the theme clear in the book To Kill a Mockingbird. Tom Robinson, the juror, Miss Maudie, Jem, Mrs. Dubose, and Atticus are examples of courageous people who showed these qualities. These three types of bravery are universal beliefs for storybook characters and people of the real world.

      my god. this is such a great day... well, besides the history final part. anyways, i saw a movie, a guy thing. i didnt really understand the title. it had nothing to do with things guys do. well, except for the part where karen calls the spendmart guy. but i think the people who made the movie could have spent more time making the "guy thing" more obvious. after the movie, i came home. finished the last of the cookie dough ice cream. i seriously live on that stuff. i read some of the carnivourus carnival. i luv the way lemony snicket writes. its really strange. i heard a radio interview with him once. he sounds like a normal guy. he didnt sound they way i imagined him. but that goes to show that people surprise u. and instead of being disappointed that he was a totally mysterious guy, i saw how a really average sounding guy can be turned into a mysterious stranger by writing. creepy huh? ok. that was my totally deep mushy thought of the day.  so on to other things. i also caught up a little bit in draco dormiens. of course everyone has read them like five times except me. i'm on chapter 6 still. between the last time i blogged and now, i havnt read any cassandra claire. instead, i ate dinner, watched friends, and watched high school reunion. i no. its dumb that i watch that show. but sum of the guys r pretty hot. except, all the girls on that show think dan b. is hot. he's an a** and butt-ugly. dave goodman is gorgeous too, but he's a jerk. jason's too buff for me. ben, ben's really sweet, but he's not very good looking. he's ok. chris, i dunno. he never does anything. the other dan is so so so hot. he's also 14 years older than me so i'll try not to think of him.  i hafta clean my room this weekend. well, not this weekend. more like tomora. on monday i hafta clean out the closet. on monday i also hafta put all my english and history papers in a new binder. my brother bought me a binder for my birthday. and its a lot cooler than my old one. for one its bigger. and its black. i like the color black. its peaceful. ok well, mayb not to u. but black is like nothing. nothing to worry about, nothing forced upon, jest nothing. sumtimes nothing is good. now nothing is good. and rite now, i like nothing.  now i'm boring u. b4 u decide to never read my blogs again think about this. what is the plural form for the word platapus? is it platapi or platapuses?

      "No One Knows"  We get some rules to follow That and this These and those No one knows  We get these pills to swallow How they stick In your throat Tastes like gold  Oh, what you do to me No one knows  And I realize you’re mine Indeed a fool of mine And I realize you’re mine Indeed a fool of mine Ahh  I journey through the desert Of the mind With no hope I found low  I drift along the ocean Dead lifeboats in the sun  And come undone  Pleasently caving in I come undone  And I realize you’re mine Indeed a fool of mine And I realize you’re mine Indeed a fool and mine Ahhh  Heaven smiles above me What a gift there below But no one knows  A gift that you give to me No one knows

      "We're Going To Be Friends"  Fall is here, hear the yell back to school, ring the bell brand new shoes, walking blues climb the fence, books and pens I can tell that we're going to be friends  Walk with me, Suzy Lee through the park and by the tree we will rest upon the ground and look at all the bugs we found safely walk to school without a sound safely walk to school without a sound  Here we are, no one else we walked to school all by ourselves there's dirt on our uniforms from chasing all the ants and worms we clean up and now its time to learn we clean up and now its time to learn  Numbers, letters, learn to spell nouns, and books, and show and tell at playtime we will throw the ball back to class, through the hall teacher marks our height against the wall teacher marks our height against the wall  We don't notice any time pass we don't notice anything we sit side by side in every class teacher thinks that I sound funny but she likes the way you sing  Tonight I'll dream while in my bed when silly thoughts go through my head about the bugs and alphabet and when I wake tommorow I'll bet that you and I will walk together again I can tell that we're going to be friends

      poop. lotr two towers didnt get best film. o well, i didnt expect it. fantasies only get nominated, they never win. neway, at least they got the honary thingeedoo. u no, where they talk about how great the movie was. and guess who presented this honorary thingeedoo? none other than, heath ledger. the is like bringing two of my favorite things together. like bringing the movie and life together. like bringing bacon and tea together. like bringing dom and me together... but not that way... but together. bwahahaha!!! that has got to be one of the funniest documentry type thing i'v ever seen. may it win many awards. as u can tell, the bag of bonbons i'v been selling has been consumed, by whom u should no by now. neway, off to learn the noseflute- a very difficult instrument to master. but seriously guys, i no, as hard to believe as this is they showed a clip of sean astin!!! (yes kelly) but no elijah or orlando. (tragic isnt it) but that's because the stupid farters didnt make peter jackson win nor the movie win. o well, they no better for next year. i bid thee adieu as i am probably going to fall asleep on the computer because of the sleep deprivation i'v been thru since my birthday. yes, if u havnt guessed im 14. but if ur up to date, u should no i'v been 14 for like 5 days now. away to thee i flee. no wait, scratch that. away to bed i flee. adieu adieu adieu. (yes, i'v been reading ode to a mockingbird, how'd u guess) i'm gonna make a song out of that poem sumday. and my band's name is going to b troubadors of the modern era. bwahahahaha. i'd better go now.

      alrite. everybody, forget all that i'v written before. due to a misunderstanding, i hav decided to change my policies. there will not b song of the week anymore. i probly wont say anything pervy. and i wont address people. this is not a message board and i intend not to use it to communicate. this will be more journal like; for my own enjoyment and not the enjoyment of whoever mite be reading this.   furthermore, i would not like to b mentioned in any secret diary type things. according to the ex post facto law, i cant be mad at people who hav already used my name (and u may keep it in there) but i dont want my name in such profanities. u may however use my first name in ur blog or watever.   another note, as this is for my own satisfaction (shut up), anyone can read this with this warning. i dont care if u dont like wat i say.

      two facts about shakespeare i thought interesting: Will wrote lewd comments about woman. In Romeo and Juliet, Juliet’s nurse crudely tells Juliet "thou (you) wilt (will) fall backward when thou (you) hast (have) more wit" (Act I, Scene III, Line 41), by which she means Juliet will learn to fall or lie on her back (have sex) when she is older.  we're starting Romeo and Juliet tomora. i'll be the one laughing.  The Bard crudely discusses genitalia size in The Taming of the Shrew where the character Curtis tells Grumio, "Away, you three-inch fool" (Act IV, Scene I, Lines 26-28). Grumio banally replies that he is at least as long as his foot.

      since it is a new week, a new song of the week is in order. in honor of anj's half bday, i'v decided to let her pick the song. however she's not at home. so i'v decided to honor kelly who's bday is feb. 4. (u two will switch, anj u hav next week) the song of the week is platypus (i hate you) by greenday which goes very fast and only kelly can hear what they're saying. here it is: "Platypus (I Hate You)"  Your rise and fall  Back up against the wall  What goes around is coming back and haunting you  It's time to quit  Cause you ain't worth the shit  Under my shoes or the piss on the ground   No one loves you and you know it  Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care  Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you want  to hear.  I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU   I heard your sick  Sucked on that cancer stick  A throbbing tumor and a radiation high  Shit out of luck  And now your time is up  It brings me pleasure just to know you're going to die   Dickhead, Fuckface, cock smoking, mother fucking, asshole, dirty twat, waste of semen, I hope you die HEY   Red eye, code blue  I'd like to strangle you  And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull  When you go down  Head first into the ground  I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave  pleasant lyrics huh?

      i'm very disappointed in all of u. i wrote a question and only one person bothered to answer. here's her answer: according to my brother who is currently facinated with the english language(did you know that to be facinate is the root for being put under and evil spell)  it can be platapi or platapuses  though he says:  The plural of platypus?  Actually, there are two!  Both 'platypuses' and 'platypi' are said to be correct in the English language!  What do you think of that?  I'm not sure why 'platypi' is correct, however, as that suggests that the word 'playpus' is of Latin word.  (Latin words that end in -us have a plural form ending in -i, such as 'fungus : fungi' or 'octopus : octopi'.)  The name 'platypus', however, comes from Greek words.  The Greek words platus (flat) and pous (foot) were combined to form the word platupous (flat-footed).  thank u linz (and brother glenn)

      ok, back, feeling better. anyway, the guy was so smart. i mean, iambic pentameter is no piece of cake. plus his play (like to play, not a noun) on words. when u think about how much he's given to the world, he's like a god of theatre and writing. when i get out of highschool, i'm taking a year off before college. during that year i think i might wanna move to london and maybe work at the globe theatre. that would be a dream come true.

      tip for those with long blogs: go to settings, then where it says show ___ days' posts, change it to a lower number. now i gtg, a combination of cramps and hunger has stricken me and i believe i'v strayed too far from the tv.

      PEOPLE!!! for future reference, long blogs scare me. if u want me to read it thoroughly and completely, please keep it short. not to nag or anything. i no mine isnt a perfect example but when ur blogs start looking like chapters of a book, people start losing interest.

      almost had a nervous break-down today. i finished all my homework at like 7 which is four hours earlier than usual. well, anyways. i decided i was going to cut out sum pics from the magazines i jest got. i was planning on cutting out a pic of lij and a thing where ur supposed to guess the celebrity the body part pictured belongs to (no, they didnt hav any...) anyway, they hav orlando's facial hair. thus the game's appeal. well, i started looking for it. i pile all the clothes on one of the room and sorted thru magazines and i still couldnt find it. i went temporarily insane and ran thru the house looking for my long-lost zine. no one had seen it. finally i ranted to julia who advised me to put sugar in my system. i ate on bag of like 50 orange candies (definately addictive) and finally decided to try near the closet. after putting the pillows and bedsheets on the bed, putting more clothes in my pile, and pushing aside my cds, i caught a glimpse of the item i had wasted an hour of my life looking for. i was so relieved.   i cut out the pictures in that magazine, and a hot pic of orlando, and simple plan (did u no they're mother tongue is french?) from seventeen and now i'm done cutting magazines for this month. no, wait. nm. jess from gg is on ym. i need to get that magazine. then my cutting is complete. actually, i like dave from gg better. but milo watever will hafta do.   hav u ever noticed that magazines r never complete without at least one pic of a lotr star? well, i noticed. and i dont mind. more hot pics of them for me!!! i luv them all!!! esp. lij, orly, dom, and billy. which happens to be majority of them. esp. esp. lij then.   o and that  i am not european, i'd rather be asian thing. really works. except for anj. who is a total freak. kelly (who's ancestors came from ireland) is supposedly irish. courtney, bethany, and i (who's ancestors came from asia) are asian. anj u retard, u screwed it up sumhow. (oops broke my rule again) (too bad)

      to everyone who has watched the lion king: hav u noticed when pumba gets stuck in the tree root and nala is about to eat him. timon cums and starts trying to push pumba free and he says "why do i always have to save your AHHHHHHHHH!" (nala tries to ponce on them). chel and i discovered this while watching the movie with geoffrey and james burrows (ages 4 and 1). they didnt get why we were cracking up.

      chel, u forgot to add to ur blog about the peace rally, that to answer bush's question "is our children learning?" doesnt this prove our children (well, by our children i include myself, as i hav none of my own and am still techniquely considered one) know sumthing. especially to be expressing our views against war. we rnt stupid. well, sum are (namely, my bro) but most of us arent. but anyway. we understand the situation the world is currently in and understand the reason why were attacking iraq (not n. korea) is because 1)we want oil from iraq 2)n. korea would probably bomb calif. if they wanted to and bush doesnt giv a fuck about us californians. sumtimes i seriously think california could b its own nation and maybe it should. if we get bombed i vote we separate from the us or get a better president who is actually qualified.

      my gawd. i hav so much free time i dont no wat to do with myself. i like this catch up weekend/ski week thing. u no wat. since we live in california i think it should be changed to ski/surf week. i'm going surfing. i bet the people in hawaii are going surfing. is anyone else going surfing? well, i'm surfing in maui if anyone cares.   lowlites of the week: *five fucker tests/quizzes *basketball (we never do anything new. the only reason its fun is becuz anj and sarrah and paige r on it. and i guess val and caitlin and maybe katie) (elizabeth is annoying, the day before school started they asked me to show her around and now she thinks she's a really good friend of mine and she hangs around me every chance she gets. is this true for u sarrah and paige?) *homework, well is it ever anything but a lowlite *movietime (we dont really do anything. my version of filming is get off ur ass and get outside and film watever's there. or i guess writing a script could help, but it doesnt need to be practiced 50 kajillion times. my movietime class normally has like 15 min to goof off. actually, i'm not sure if we're supposed to do that, we just do.) *i cant go to the feb. 14 kgb concert, the feb. 26 donnas/kgb concert, or the feb. 27 finch/new found glory concert *plus i cant hav a bday party *i cant get my hair cut/dyed *i figured, the only reason i got a solo in the musical is becuz i'm loud and childlike *chel and jil and i couldnt find either pic of lij holding frank(e)(a) (i dont no how to spell it) potente's ass nor the pic of elijah with a bow in a certain place (u no wat i'm talking abou)  on to happier things... highlites of the week: *babysitting geoffrey and james tomora with chel *getting a good grade for the english test i didnt study for *not flunking the math test (i didnt do that bad, but i still hate emily) *i got a tape of the songs for the musical and i've established that i hafta stand between cristina q. and kelly s. so i dont get cunfuzzed. *i can be loud and childlike for the solo *musical makes me happy. i mean, its a class in which u mix my two favorite things (well, besides elijah) acting and singing *i forgot to sell my 20 packs of bonbons so now i hav a supply that'll last me thru march (at the most) *i remembered to separate the whites and the colors for laundry *i'm getting ok at free throws (ppl, keeping ur feet on the ground REALLY helps, i swear) *i got more pics of lij (hot!!! i forgive him for 1) touching frank(e)(a) potente's ass and 2)smoking) *wel, we're going surfing next week that's good *speaking of surfing, i got a new STRAPLESS swimsuit (that me mum picked for me) *i'v totally and completely fallen for benvolio (he's not as hot as lij, so he's my storybook love and lij is my real life love) *and then i guess, since i hav a storybook love and a real life love, my tvshow love is dave rygalsky. i luv u dave, benvolio, and ELIJAH *i hav a lot of free time and for the first time since winterbreak i'll be able to sleep at nine but i probably will choose not to.

      ugggghhhh. failed every test/quiz taken today. hafta do french and science homework. plus write a paper on act 1, scene 1 of R&J. at least R&J will resemble fun.   continuing on wat i said about dave rygalsky. he's played by adam brody who was in smallville (the episode where the guy paints things and they come true). i dunno, but i suspect that the character dave rygalsky is cooler than adam brody, cuz dave plays guitar in a band and that is hot. and he's such a sweetie. and he was funny on last nite's episode. "dude, christians can rock as well as the rest of us."... "uhh... ya, i guess so. sry guys." to explain, dave and lane are keeping their relationship secret from the other ppl in their band, but when they were driving thru town, lane's mom stops them and mentions something about dave playing hymns for a christian group and about lane like him. the next time the band got together, the other ppl brought up the meeting with Mrs. Kim. luckily they thought dave was hiding his faith and not his relationship. it was funny. u had to see it to think so tho.  COLD PLAY CONCERT MAY 30. (which is the day classes get out) (but also the fri. before finals) (come on ppl, u hafta relax too) (study on sat and sun, and relax on fri). coldplay is my favorite european band. (notice, i didnt say song) (fave euro song would be a tie btw dont mug yourself and dansplaat) (dansmaar dit is nu lekkere dansplaat) (that was dutch, but i dont no wat i said)

      went surfing. hehe. it was so much fun. caught the first wave. got wat the adults said was the ultimate comment from the surfing teacher guy. supposedly i was shredding. sumthing like that. does anyone no wat that means? i hav no clue about surfing lingo. we got sum pictures. none of me wiping out. i thought i did pretty well, since there's no documentry of me messing up. my dad's another story. i think he got up once for every five times i got up. he ended up riding the waves sitting on his board with his hands in the air like a rollercoaster. lotsa hotties here guys. and its nice and warm. the ocean is nice. the pool is a little cold tho. i dragged a floaty thing out, put my strapless swimsuit on, and i'm trying to get rid of the tanlines i picked up while surfing. havnt seen any sign of mia. she's probably on the otherside of the island, where all the resorts are. we had a really good dinner last night. the restaurant was ontop of this pool. it had fish, lobstors, pufferfish, etc in it. it was so cool. we saw the waiters feeding the fish and they were really duking it out. i'v developed a fear of puffer fish. 1)they're huge(ish). 2)they're poisonous to eat (well, i'm still scared of em). 3)well, i dunno. i just wouldnt like to meet one in a dark alley (but i dont think that'll be a problem.)  i cant believe we hafta go back to school. roar. i hate school. but anyways, can sumone tape the grammys for me. our plane doesnt land til 9 o'clock sunday (with the jet lag i'm sure i'll sleep thru p1 and 2. o well, gtg work on my tan.

(order bethany/kelly/all of u: go get it!!!!). there we go.

           You are red. You are impure, but noble. You are precious and true to yourself and others. When you love, you love entirely, and will do anything to make your love happy. You are sure of your identity, therefore, you cannot change others or be changed. You are a true prince, you may be forgotten, but without you, none of us could go on.   What inner color are you?

        Dream, the third of The Endless, you are in charge of the Dreaming, all imagination and creativity, everyone knows your beautiful realm, but none truly understand it. You are dark and brooding, creative, and spend a lot of time by yourself, just thinking. You are almost as serious as Destiny, but not quite. Everyone is enchanted by you, but you keep them all at a distance, even when you shouldn't.    urlLink   Which Endless are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      celebrating national procrastination week early. procrastinated yesterday. procrastinating rite now. drew v. lovely(if i do say so myself) picture of legolas today. planning on giving it to bethany in exchange for a drawing of frodo. she kept screwing up his lips this afternoon. plz make them better. bethany will hafta fix legolas's face since people drawing people is not my strong point. i can howeve draw clothes (wrinkles included). his clothes look cool. if i didnt draw it i would never hav noticed the detail in his cuffs, belt, and boots. (the match!) also noticed wat a gorgeous color he's wearing under his tunic thing. its like a light  metalic purple. its so pretty. would kill for a dress same color. in fact, i plan on designing my own dress for next fd dance. either based on legolas's costume or perhaps a version of arwens. she's so pretty. i want to b liv tyler. k. if i dont finish this science stuff tonite i think he'll no for a fact i havnt been doing the homework. he wore a cowboy hat today. thank god i didnt hav science today. i wouldnt stopped laughing.

      ok. been reading everybody's blogs. got thru three of them befor the fecking guilt of not saying anything got to me. i hafta blog. i'v been in a pissy mood lately and i guess you people need an apology. so i'm sry for being a bitch. except to dick. i'm not sry for being a bitch while playing basketball. i'm so glad. i was bitchy enough that now people are afraid to discuss my bitchiness around me and i got dick to apologize.  ok i really need to throw a way this pixie stick wrapper. i divided it into ten section. then divied each of those in half vertically. then each half in half vertically again. no i'm gonna stop as i am scaring myself. i'm gonna copy chel and rite my goals down. i dont think she'll mind as i dont suppose she (nor anyone else reads this).  1) learn guitar (no i did not copy chel on that. if u no me, u'd no that i'v been wanting to do that for a while) 2) stop listening to music crap and actually find something i enjoy, not that wat i listen to is crap. its just that i think i could do better without being subjected to avril lavigne, justin timberlake, and all that other shit they play at the dance 3) stop swearing (well, at least american swearing) 4) fully emerse myself in the british culture (as i love every aspect of their civilization) 5) better nutrition (i no that's cheesy, but i eat really unhealthily. i skip pretty much the first two meals of the day. snack A LOT. and pig out during dinner. speaking of which. i havent eaten one and its half past eight. 6)do better in school. (my grades are severely dropping, and i mean SEVERELY) 7) be painfully honest like draco

"pain, LOTS of pain."-the red-head in a knight's tale. ooooo. sad depressing song over. now its jimmy eat world. a praised chorus. mollie's favorite song. one of my favorites. crimson and clover!!! anyways, tomm. comm. service day. yea!!! going to 1/2 moon bay to pull ice plants. actually, they said "removing unindegeneous plants" but i translated for u. need to find gloves. and see if i hav clothes appropriate for sand and bad weather. feeling its gonna drizzle. at least over cast. maybe there'll be hot surfer dudes at the beach. maybe not. probly not. too cold. calif. weather not that great. well, not great rite now. hav had to keep large sweatshirt on all day. v. warm large sweatshirt. nice and cozy.  every log in my house, straight as a log can grow! musical. bahumbug.blaha.nottin more to say. so good nite. althogh its not nite.i want ice cream.

Searching, searching for signs of life       All expressed here, love, happiness, and strife.  ok so its cheesy. pretty good for top of my head. his eyes are so beautiful. i luv elijah wood's and joseph fiennes' eyes. jf has green eyes. i'm so happy i got a luckogram from will shakespeare. he was so hot!!! in the movie of course. i cant vouch for real life, but we can ask bethany since she lived back then.

      passed piano test with a 98, got a 96 on explo, decades was held back until like four weeks later courtesy of sick lali, dc was ok, my room still isnt clean. fuck life. that's my new motto. i always use the everybody blog but that doesnt work. i've been writing really depressing things on there and i dont think people are happy. i even wrote a depressing goth poem on the blog. i'm not sure how that went off because at this point everyone is so used to my depressing nature that they just ignore me. all for the best. i never see them anyways. i should just dig a hole and live there.   to update whoever could be reading this, the war is pretty much over. it sucked ass. they found no weapons of mass destruction (well, who'da thunk?)damn president. even worse, arnold schwarjdfka nikgv (however u spell it) is gov. i will NEVER go to a UC. i dont want his signiture anywhere near me. jackass.  hav become addicted to soda, chocolate, and burt's bees. hav spent a shitload of time folding clothes today. i think i mite hav a fever. that would explain a lot.

      I have not written in a long time. I need to remember to use this more often. To update the internet stalkers who actually read this I am: *trying to use proper grammar and spelling (I don't remember why... I think someone was saying that it was too hard for me) *taking part in the musical "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" *My room is not clean, though it was a couple weeks ago, before I started packing for a trip to Quebec *I now know that I can survive below freezing tempuratures *Soccer was a blast *a new piano test is approaching *Courtney plans the best birthday parties *Homework is hell as usual *I hope I don't have such a depressing outlook on life as I did my last post. I'm actually quite a jovial child. I'm out of my awkward phase which is joyous indeed. Though, when you go to Castilleja, you're awkward stage lasts until the end of high school. I'm over my geeky phase in that case and I'm still awkward. *Even if my room is not clean, my shelves are. I spent a good amount of time arranging them today. I had new pictures to put up. Ok. Stopping with the stars. They're v. preppy-looking aren't they? Oh well... I don't think I'm a v. preppy person. Well, yes, maybe more than others. My clothing style is rather a mishmosh of stuff. I like dressing up. Pretty dresses are cool. I will wear the color pink. Though, I like purple better. But I'll wear pink. That's pretty preppy. I'm not popular. And I'm not full out punk.  I have purple hair now and it makes me happy. I forgot how dark my hair was. When it grows back to black it'll be scary dark. But I like it neon purple for now. OH! Would you like more on politics? Hmmmm... Well, the war is technically still going since there still is resistance. Wars start so fast and end so slowly. It's annoying. Of course, no weapons of mass destruction, so now they're searching for "programs" of mass destruction. That means that if some obscure person was just randomly thinking, What would happen if I started making nuclear weapons? He/She will be brought to the U.S. and tried for some random irrelevent crime (because this is what our government has been reduced to) and essentially executed for no apparent reason. Tell me again why he was chosen to be President? I still maintain he did not win this election. Bozo. I can't believe four years of complaining about Bush have gone by. Unfortunatly, it seems as though he will with the 2004 elections. BOOHISS. Kerry... well... I have nothing to say about Kerry. I wish Dean had more than fanatical grassroots support. Kucinich. I wish people didn't think he was so left. Mr. Blair was saying the other day, that in America sometimes the phrase "too liberal" is bad. Like a swear word. I think that more people should attend the liberal activists club. It's the funnest thing in the world. Except, we kind of have not gotten to the activist part of it yet. It's kind of hard for all of us to agree to do something. Everyone is so busy. Plus, now Chelsea and I cannot go because we have government meeting. Speaking of which to add to my preppy start list. I am not 1/4 of the social committee of the class of 2007. As our first act we canceled the Bellarmine social due to lack of interest. We tried to vote on either a bandnite or a dance and by some miracle 62 people divided into 2 groups of 31 and now we are stuck. I say bandnite. We really need to get profit and cost numbers from the sophmore government. Half of our class thinks that dances make $2000 bucks. I have news for them. Dances do NOT make that much money. They make just as much or less than bandnites. We will need to find real numbers. Got to go. Goodnight.

      Essay: I've done a bit of brainstorming, but not much. And it is sad, because I have done like nothing and its due really soon. Everything is due soon, come to think of it. I work hard on it tomorrow and ask him to look at my notes, perhaps. I want an A. Really badly.

      I have broken so many nails this week I thought it best I put on clear nailpolish. So I did. I didn't do a particularly good job, but the job got done. I need an umbrella for tomorrow. Founder's Day. Ugghh. The only one of remotely enjoyed was the one during which it rained. Most of the time we sit outside in the blazing sun, being burnt to a crisp, while watching people give speeches for two hours. At least the food is decent.  My mother stopped coming because it was so boring, so Kelly is replacing her.  My room is a complete mess. I have no time to clean it either. So much. Today I copied Fiona's planner (she's a hell of a lot more organized than me) and I found that I have at least two humongo projects everyweek until the end of the quarter. Which is the end of Freshman year. I hate being a freshman.

      I think the best word to describe someone you don't like is malicious. Not that I have anybody to hate. But isn't it a great word. It implies that whoever has evil intentions and it is your unbiased opinion that this person is malicious. Plus it just rolls off the tongue. It's delectible as delicious, but evil as malevolent. It craves malevolence. I love that word.

      HI. Lots and lots of tests and quizzes. Yes, I do realize this is my life. What do I talk about in my spare time? Homework. What do I talk about in time that is not spare? Homework. I think it's like a disease. It's starts out small in first grade and it eats you over the years. Then, when you least expect it, you realize, the amoeba has taken over your life.

      Reading Chrissy's blog is sad. It makes me want to cry. It might seem like these are the emotions of a three year old, but at age fifteen, it's just as basic.  I wish she wouldn't hurt herself. It really hurts me too. I know how she feels though, I've felt the same way at times. I dislike how my life is all about pleasing others. When do I do something for myself? Ok, point out, when I'm older, I'll appreciate the education I've recieved and the hard work I've accomplished. But why do I get grief when I do something for myself. Grief as in, why must I do theatre? it disrupts peoples' schedules. Grief as in, why must I wait until 11 to wake up? The truth is it makes me feel good and I don't want to stop feeling good, because I think I know how it is to fall down hard.

      I babysat today. The baby woke up. I put her back down. She got up again. I changed her diaper. (Not fun). I put her back down. I went back to my movie. She got up again. I put her down and repeated the words "Ellie is tired" until she fell asleep. This took quite sometime. But she stayed asleep. Geez. Kids can be a pain after they learn to stand up. By the way, don't let me have kids. 1) Ruin my uber-sexy figure 2)I heard breast-feeding makes your boobs go away and since I don't have any, I don't think the result would be any better 3) They cry a lot. Maybe I'll adopt.

       More...   Another "Only at Castilleja" phrase. Actually I change my mind, its an "Only at my school" phrase because if I mention my school on my blog I could get suspended. What dipshit thought of that rule?   Only at my school do people cringe when they see a guy playfully punch another guy in the chest, then realize, he felt no pain because he has no boobs.

       Die Spider Die!   I'm really scared because there is a spider in my room and I saw it and I tried to kill it by throwing an algebra book at it but I missed because the algebra book was too heavy. So I tried hitting it with a lamp and I thought I got it but I didn't want to check under the lamp so I didn't. Then I wrote my essay and looked behind and there it was so I threw a physics book on it and I don't think I missed but I'm too scared to find out. I HATE ARACHNIDS.

       silicon graphics made my computer.   I have realized that my friends depend on my classes. For instance, do I ever talk to Chelsea? Nope. We have no classes. Well, we have one but there's an alienation between me and meredith which normally drives Chelsea to the Meredith side because Meredith's 1) smarter 2) cooler 3) easier to agree with as half the population just goes along with what she says. This bugs me. Esp. Barbara. Get your own opinions, jeez! Meredith honestly thinks I'm stupid. I normally avoid her but as I have more classes with her than people in my own grade, this proves difficult. Enough bashing other people.  I don't particularly like my advisory. I like about 4 people in it (sadly, this includes myself. I'm allowed to like myself.). Plus there's only one interesting person. Well, I guess me fighting everyone else could be interesting. Bethany, you're the interesting person if you would like to know, but you've probably already assumed this. Everyone is so girly. And Californian. Being Californian is ok, but being a valley girl and using like every other word is kind of too much. I know I use the word a lot, but compared to my advisory, I'm a regular tomboy. I hate being outnumbered by shallowness.

      For the first time in a good while, I do not have much homework to fill my hours with ceaseless worrying, stressing, and unhappiness. Last week was hell. And despite that, I got a 97 on the C & C test. Now tell me, how the HELL is that possible as I did not even finish the essay on it??? I must be a genious. Or terribly favored by the teacher. Or I got a lot of the bonus questions, plus one extra because I found a typo on the test.

I fell asleep this afternoon (when I got home) which explains why I'm STILL doing homework. Then again, I had to watch Smallville. Otherwise no one would find out that Chloe dies. Anjie is looking into BFD tickets. I haven't done math homework. I haven't studied the subjunctive. I don't know what the past subjunctive tense is used for.

I don't want to be there at that dorkfest alone. Too late I am a dork. Everyone join chorus next year. There's a trip to Prague and Salzburg for under $3000 (cheap!). I want to go, but only if fun people are going. Kelly I can see you shaking your head saying that you can't sing, but neither can I and I got an A on my final last year and I suck.

I don't care what, I just want the tickets. Apparently when I dial 877-244-1049 I needn't dial 1 first. Dumb area code crap things. I shall get it next time! I have started reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. I'm on chapter 5. The chapters are really short.

      My parents are so anal. First it was, Why don't we take you to the library where you can volunteer? My reaction was, Ummmm... Isn't that a bit far? Remember, you hate driving me. They say, No, it's fine. I say, in that case, can I go to conditioning at school to get in shape. They say, No, to far away. I say, it's as far as the library. They say, It's out of the question. Can't you find something to do this summer? I say, I kind of just suggested one. They say, Wouldn't the library be nicer? I say, Wouldn't you guys just be better off telling me I have no choice than pretending to give me one? They say, Clean your room. (This is obviously they're way of telling me that I'm right without acknowledging my argument powers.)   Speaking of my argument powers. This was another topic for them to be anal about. They say, Gee, you're so talented at finding information and argueing a point. Wouldn't you like to be a lawyer? I say, No. I wouldn't like doing that everyday. I don't like the idea of arguing for someone who is guilty. They say, It makes money.  Doesn't the world revolve around money? Personnally, I'd rather not have anything to do with economics. This explains my being the only one in the family who is broke. I hate commercialized things. Nascar annoys me. Commercials annoy me. The only purpose I see for money is to spend it. I do not take pleasure in hoarding it, in counting it, in investing it. This bores me. I don't care for stocks. I see the sure way of becoming more successful in EARNING and therefore having the money. Stocks are risky and annoying as hell.  I think I was born into the wrong family. For example, my entire family consists of math nerds. Currently, I use my math book to smash unwanted bugs. This is handy. I see no other purpose in that goddam book. Do you really expect me to read it? I laugh in your face because you are obviously a twit. They say, Your room is messy. Clean it. I say, It's not messy, it's contaminated. I've been in school too long. They say, You're out of school. How can it be contaminated? I say (in my head, I'm already in trouble for not going to the library), School is a disease. The aftereffects continue as long as there is homework. I have general disdain for what they tell me. They say, Wake up in the morning. I say, It's cold in the morning. They say, Take out the trash. I say, It's cold outside. They say, take the trash out tomorrow morning. I say (again, in my head), Have you been listening to my part of the conversation? I'd rather not be out of bed in the morning. I'm jetlagged (it's been a year but I don't take jetlag well) and therefore must stay up until 2a.m. Is this so hard to understand? What is their problem? They can't see through their money, their own time, their own pleasures. I hardly know them.

      So I've obtained another email in order to humor my mother. In second grade it was, We've got you an email account. We hope you use it. In fifth grade it was, Perhaps you need another email account. Try yahoo. In sixth grade it was, The school has given you an email account. You're required to use it. Now, I get an email saying, You might want another email account. Try google g-mail.  Do they realize I now must check four email accounts? Actually, I check school email only during school. And the rest, like every other day (sometimes every other month depending on how dependent I am on the computer). At the moment, it's peak babysitting season. Parents have summer parties and the kids are out of school. This is good for us babysitters. I plan on paying off all my debts (only ~$100) and earning money to keep me happy until next season. However, I don't see people's christmas presents coming from this fund. Maybe everyone will get potholders or something easy for me to make. Or I can just bake a bunch of cookies which will probably win out. Haha. Sorry, I think I just ruined it for you. Oh well, you can be surprised at how cheap I am and I'm probably very cheap.  Drivers ed continues. The only thing getting me through the agony is the thought that one day, I shan't depend on others to help me escape. I hate having to call 5 people everytime I need a ride, or showing up somewhere at 11 because my parents were either at work or had something better to do (watch soap operas).  Off topic a bit, my family is really into soap operas. My mother, my grandmother, and my grandfather all watch soaps. My brother and my dad only watch sports. I'm the odd one. I like interior design shows. Is that too strange? I like the pretty colors and the idea that I could be creative (I'd probably step on it though. I step on everything.) Interior design is so much fun. I wish I could redecorate our bathroom. At the moment the wallpaper is ugly 50s print. The tub is grey and pink (such a charming color combination. Not.). I like four items our bathroom; the clear duck in the rain trashcan, the metal wire containers, the vase with lollipops in it, and the blue locker shelf that is now serving as an extra hair dryer kind of type stuff shelf. May I add that 1) They match each other and not the bathroom and 2) I put most of them in. Unfortunatly, the locker shelf shall only be with us until September when it moves back into my locker at school. Actually, I don't use a locker, so need I a locker shelf? This point is debatable and the conversation shall be resumed closer to the start of school.  More on the point of interior decorating, I've decided to retire some posters in my room. Colin Farell, Paul Walker, Eminem, and Milo Ventimiglia shall be leaving and will hopefully be replaced by some conventional shelves. The dophins, Tom Welling (not that I need him, but he brings color as his shirt is red), All-American Rejects (same note as Tom), Elijah, Mike Skinner, the Far Side Comic about sound technicians, The Pirates poster, another Elijah, Lord of the oil, a picture for seventh grade, a lion thing from my nursery when I was a baby, the calendar, another nursery wall-hanging, the soccer picture from sixth grade, a black-and-white picture of a beach that I colored on, and the butterflies will stay. O and Legolas and Gimli will stay as well because they make a comical hat rack. Of course, right now I've also got scarves, stuffed monkeys, stilletos, and belts hanging on them too, so the term "hat" rack might be inappropriate.  I think I'll sleep now. I have a PB teen catalog that I want to skim. (My god, I'm interior design freak.)

      I was looking at a picture of Vaux le Vicompte and it made me want to cry. It was so beautiful. It was so dark and solemn and I loved it as soon as I stepped into those beautiful gardens. I remember who I was with. Chrissy, Bethany, Chelsea, and myself. It was so peaceful. It was softly drizzling. At this point, Bethany and I weren't getting along so well. But everything was kind of pushed aside that night. Our fragile relationship was ignored and we were all friends. Like it was all meant to be. The drops were falling lightly on our faces. So lightly you could barely feel them. It was so magical. And the smell. Indescribable. I remember that place like I remember no other. The night was so beautiful I hardly believe such perfect circumstances could ever take place again. Or at least in front of me.
