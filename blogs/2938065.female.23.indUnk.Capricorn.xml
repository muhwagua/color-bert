      My right eye has been twitching since yesterday afternoon. It's damn annoying!

      I'm feeling a great sense of accomplishment today. It's not like I've done all the work there is, but somehow beeing here when my great aunt came to pick something up, finally finishing last weekend's work and hammering maths into my best friend's little brother's head make me feel good. I love primary school maths, by the way.

      This week I learnt that a girl I was quite close with in primary school is pregnant. OK, so it's not like she's very young, she'll be almost 24 when the baby is born. Still, she's my first female school mate to have a baby. And another primary school class mate is getting married this year. I'm not surprised though, I remember in 7th or 8th grade she announced the day she would get married. She said it would be in 2005. So 2004 is even earlier than she predicted 10 years ago.  Speaking of weddings, my friend N. has sent me a very funny link:  urlLink Hick Wedding .

      It has snowed at least a little every day this week. I wonder how long it's going take for all this snow to melt.  I used to love snow. And I still do, but this week I realised for the first time that just like rain, snow doesn't go well with PMS and emotional distress. Speaking of which, this has been a pretty rotten week. I had two nights with barely any sleep. I'm really glad I have L. to talk to about this (I will not write the whole story here), she makes me feel better. I know I'll be fine, but I also know there will that there will be potentially painful follow-ups on this story.

      Is it possible for a man and a woman to be just friends? I say yes, but there must be absolutely no attraction. For example me and S. Physically I'm not attracted to him at all, but I like the way he thinks (most of the time). But I guess if I was, say, drunk, I would be seriously in danger if there were any sparks coming from him. I'd quite literally lower my standards. Note to self: do not get too drunk at Edi pissup!  Thinking about all my guy friends. None of them is the kind I would say is absolutely unattractive. Hmm... ok, maybe N., but his sexual orientation is, erm, well, not my type. Anyone else has a chance, I guess. It's just a matter of the level of intoxication. The one who doesn't need me to be under the influence, is a keeper.

      I didn't think I'd miss St. He may be weird, has some serious issues, is sort of creepy at times, but I miss talking to him. Well, it does seem to mean I blog more, so I guess in a way it's good.   He's already at the airport (he'd better be), and about to get on a plane to Europe. He's got my address, he'd better not be coming here for a surprise visit. :S  I can't believe I made him go. Or maybe I didn't, but he really needed some time management help...  Oh, and here's my personalised horoscope for today:  Quote------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ mercury is hanging aound in your moon house, waiting to be noticed. a typo will enliven your day and fate leads you to a bus stop ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------by B & B  Hmm... Well, I did walk past a bus stop today, but then I do every time I go to uni. No spectacular, life-changing typos, although St. made a weird one yesterday and kept it going all day today.  So now I'm just waiting for S. to come online, but it'll probably only be for a few minutes. It's not like we've got anything to talk about. Seems we need a few days of very little communication to have a good day afterwards. Oh, and it helps if I have PMS, weird as it sounds.

      That's what I am. Really. I've just written my Iceland application and the BS really is BS and yet true and utterly believable.  Now on with those two English articles by non-native speakers. They are weird and proof reading them is a nightmare. But I guess I get bonus points for doing it. I'm such a corporate-whore :P

      It happens every spring. A day when I feel nothing but joy and elation. When even new that could be considered bad, are good. When I sing as I walk.  Today is that day. I caught up with all the gossip at uni (G. and N. apparently never  really  were, one of the tutors is pregnant, or we think so, etc.), even the professor's criticism of the field trip wasn't bad, and, for the first time in months, I'm online without feeling the least bit guilty, because I've done everything I was supposed to do. It's true, I need more than one thing to keep me busy, and I manage my time better.  Oh, and sunny weather helps, too.  *GRIN*

      Ugh. Why did he have to say that? It would've been so much easier. Now I'm checking for tickets to places I really can't afford.  Talking to him now. Why am I not capable of telling him how hias remark made me feel? I know what he's gonna say, and in a way he's right. Aaaaargh!

      S.'s just said something that made me think. About me, and holidays and workcamps. And I can't even hold it against him, because I don't know exactly what he meant with it. He did say, "Forgive me for asking," first, but even saying that must mean he felt I wouldn't like the question. I know I shouldn't be upset, but I am. And I shouldn't care what he says, but I do. I'll look into Svalbard after lunch...

      It's coming to an end. Not as well as we'd hoped, but I don't care, as long as it's over. We're checking out the route today and tomorrow is the field trip. I liked working on this thing. It was a lot of work, but also fun!

      Less than a week ago it was 23°C. Now it's snowing. Hmm...  St. sent me an email after that message below, apologizing for the way he acted. He said he'd tell me about the resons for his sadness. I replied that he should only do so if he feels like it. So now there's no email from him. I wonder if I'll ever hear from him again.  D. is moving to Australia at the end of next month. I don't know how I feel about it. Guess I'm not 100% over him yet, but then I think I'd feel the same way if some random acquaintance annonced they were moving to the other side of the world.  I've now pretty much given up on the idea of doing a camp in VT. Looking into other options now.

      ...are a joke! I mean they surely can't be expecting people to be honest, since about 95% of us do it for cheap travel. Oh well. I have to decide about those two circus camps (must contact VFP!) and then about the rest of the camps as well :) And I need to ask N. about me coming to Edi at the end of August. Hmm, just realised he may be having exams then. I'm sure J. would love to have me though! And I could definitely make it to the pissup then :D

      Spring, that is.  Picked up my prize for the article yesterday. I love those t-shirts!  I talked to St. on MSN yesterday for the first time. And S. was sweet as ever. I think the other day when he was talking about the e-card I'd sent him, he was trying to talk about something specific. Oh well, he'll get to it eventually. He's still quite ill, but improving.  Re D. - I'm not talking to him these days really. And from some posts it appears he does not consider himself single any more. It  was  closure 2 weeks ago, but I still need some time not talking to him much. We may go back to talking lots, but probably not. I'm realising now it was never as real for him as it was for me. And it seems I was trying to be someone different, not myself. I may seem like I'm in my cozy little shell, but fuck it, that's who I am and I like it. It's not like I can't open up to people. It only takes a bit longer and to the ones really worth it. I know I could tell S. everything I ever told D. and it would be normal, not me trying to be someone else.  Gee, I'm getting all tearful, PMS already?

       Spring!  It's here. Amazing attendance at uni today, and we all behaved like 14-year olds at their worst hormone rush. And project meeting afterwards went really well. Am still not sure about G. and N. It seems like the two may have had something but no longer have it. I as I sort of know he's met her family which would suggest they've been together for a month or two, while there's absolutely no PDA between them. Oh well, as long as we manage to work as a group...  I didn't have to pay a late fee at the library even though I was a day (or 2?) late with returning a book.  Bad: S. is really sick. I'm worried :(

      They seem to be an item now. Sort of got it confirmed today. First reaction: noooooooo. Ten minutes later: happy! I have no idea what she sees in him and I have some serious doubts about him and his character, but she seems happy and I just hope that if this ends badly, I don't lose either of them as a friend.

      Just got a message from J. that he'd be in my part of the world in late July. Which is one of the most likely times for be to be away. And it's fine, I know I don't  have  to be here when he's here, but since I probably won't make it to Berlin in June, it would be nice to meet him. And I've pretty much given up all romatinc thought re him a while ago.  Anway, I will make my summer plans regardless of his (unsure!) European plans. Whatever happens happens, I guess...

      Why is it that even though the scanner glass seems perfectly clean, there are still spots on scanned images? Oh well, just have to scan each image a few times and then somehow I manage to get a scan with an acceptable amount of these white spots. Wow, I can't believe this is getting published!

      I went for my bacterial meningitis revaccination this morning. It's free for geography (and some other) students here. Most of the people there were 1st years. Was I that annoying 4 years ago?  In other news: S. finally went to see the doctor about his throat. He got some strong antibiotics, but he's not starting them until Sunday morning - after his birthday celebrations :) I'm glad he's finally taken care of this, he'd been in agony for almost a week!

I could probably afford any one of them. *sigh*  Had a good chat with L. We discussed D. at length and I'm quite happy to report that it didn't depress me or otherwise emotionally affect me. Looks like it really was closure. Heehee, also trolled a bit :)  S. is sick. He really can't afford it financially...

      So, Slovenia's joining the EU at midnight. I wasn't all that happy to start with, but today's radio broadcasts have made it utterly disgusting. I mean 7am news, that usually last about 20 minutes, lasted about 35 minutes today because all the EU enlargement pieces took about 15 minutes. Over-enthusiastic speeches (by politicians, mostly) all day long. Ew!

      It may be a new verb, but it suits me. I don't think I've ever had  all  my tickets  this  early. Not even for Greenland. If only I could focus on other things now.  Being sleepy doesn't help, but I can't sleep past 7am these days. All that light, birds chirping, and prophetic work-related dreams wake me up (I really am psychic, it's getting scary). So in order to get some more sleep, I hereby solemnly swear that I'll go to bed before 11pm tonight.  To do: • study study study • questionnaires into Ecxel • write field trip report • figure out an itinerary for Iceland (harass WF people  if necessary )

      My planned Iceland itinerary is no more. Sure, buses run. But only three times a week outside the main routes. Anyway, Sprengisandur is now out.    The Icelander reading this blog, please advise me:   So my plan so far is to leave Myvatn on 23rd July. I have 6 days until my plane leaves from Keflavik. The question now is: Ring-road clockwise to Reykjavik (with a stop or two) or Westfjords?

      I have no idea how V. and I started chatting, but it was 4 years ago or so. We were flirty, but I didn't want to meet up with him (major self-confidence issues back then). He was about to go to Florida to sell his yacht. We lost contact and I didn't even notice.  Last spring we started talking again. He was living in Florida. He'd gotten married, become a father and started his own business. He was still as flirty as ever. Again we lost touch while I travelled and switched to MSN messenger. I talked to him again just minutes ago. And he was his usual self again.  What is it with some people on IM? So far I've only come across two or three "normal" strangers.

      Islandija je ena velika zmeda. Včeraj sem dobila en mail v celoti v islandščini razen treh besed. OK, že mogoče dobro, da malo povežbam en iks jezik, ampak kadar gre pa za letalske karte, se pa ni za hecat. Upam, da ne bo kakšnih presenečenj na izpisku od kreditne kartice. No, še dobro, da obstaja t.i. diplomski seminar, v času katerega, namesto da bi poslusala predstavitve diplom, berem Lonely Planet za Islandijo.  Priceless quote  [...] Iceland has a good network of hostels or  farfuglaheimili  (literally, this translates as "little home for migrating birds").  from  urlLink LP Iceland, Greenland & the Faroe Islands , p. 82  Sicer me pa tudi faks mede. V nobenem primeru ne bom šla spomladi na več kot 4 izpite, kar je zame nič, ampak pošteno povedano nimam nobene motivacije. Pa nasploh me daje podoben občutek, kot sem ga imela zadnje mesece pred maturo: da se imam blazno fajn in da se mi prav nič ne ljubi učiti. Pa da bom pogrešala sošolce in vse to. Saj vem, da absolvent ni ravno isto kot matura, je pa tudi res, da smo tokrat iz cele Slovenije in da se bomo za različno dolgo razkropili po celi Evropi (če ne svetu) in vsaj nekateri povsem izgubili stik.  Čisto zares je na faksu zadnje čase zabavno. Danes nam je neki Belgijec predaval nekaj o kmetijstvu v Ardenih, ampak smo bolj malo odnesli od predavanja - ga namrečnismo nič razumeli, ker je obupno govoril angleško. Še asistentka ni mogla zadrževati smeha. In ta človek naj bi nam v petek dajal navodila za terensko delo. Rezultati bojo zanimivi.   Nagradno vprašanje: Kaj bi pomenilo tole (zapisano fonetično): "Ku mejk smol."  Nagrada... OK, še ne vem, ampak bi se dalo najbrž za kakšno razglednico iz tujih krajev zment. :)

      I've got a dentist appointment! OK, only in 2 months' time, but considering I haven't been in ages, this is progress :D  And with B.'s report already printed, my next step now is to email some hostels in Iceland. Efficiency should be my middle name (but just today).  Aja, btw,  kolk bi morala računat za 27 barvno sprintanih strani (ink-jet)?

      I hadn't talked to J. for ages (ok, probalbly more like 2 months, but felt like ages) until I sent him a message last night. He finished his reply with:  Quote----------------------------------------- Thanks for reviving communication btw -------------------------------------------by J.  Yeah, you're welcome, and would it hurt if  you  revived it?  His whole message is weird, come to think of it. Or maybe I'd forgotten what he's like...

      OK, not physically, just have them booked! They were ridiculously cheap.  I'll have a 2-day overlay in Copenhagen, so I might go visit my friends in Odense, or maybe add another country to my list by going on a daytrip to Sweden :)  I'm so excited now!  So sending faxes for free is the good thing about working for an NGO...

      ...blog about how busy I am, how I've got all these things to do etc. etc. And I started thinking exactly what I have to do. And there's only one (yes, one) little thing that has to be done, and it is very simple and shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.  But I'm not giving A. any more than 30 minutes for his chemistry. He works best under time pressure :P (and if I give him any more time, he'll figure out how useless I am at chemistry).

      Some things upset me more than they deserve. And I know I should ignore nasty comments, and I do, at least the content. But I can't ignore the sole fact that a comment has been made (not talking about blogging here!).  If you're not interested, just don't read. This is not school, you're not forced to do anything. Don't read and then complain how boring it is and insult the participants.  Oh well, at least when things like this happen, there are amazing individuals like C. and J. around.

       Definition: family lunch after my brother spends more than 24 consecutive hours with his girlfriend. Usually on Sunday, or, like today, a holiday. It is a family thing - my parents, my brother with his girlfriend and myself.   I'm beginning to hate these lunches with a passion. My brother is always cranky and my mum puts on a "nice" mask and I can't wait to get away from the table, mostly because I hate sitting next to someone who acts as if I should apologise to them or at least feel very guilty. It's like we all sit there in silence to honour my brother's sulking and pretend that he's not being completely unreasonable.  I can't wait for him to move out, which should be, if all goes as planned, in less than 6 months.

      Spring really sucks this year: it snowed today, but I'm having the worst spring fever ever. And I'm not getting tomorrow off (harassing people with our silly questionnaire), nor Friday (all day sending out applications at SCI office). And then I've got a uni assignment to work on over the weekend. Well, at least Monday's a holiday :)  The project is still one big question mark. And again - the less said the better.  OK, gotta get ready for tomorrow!

      I met J. in high school. We were friends from the beginning, but never really close. I also met Š. in high school. We've always been close friends. J. and Š. were very close in high school, but less so for the last couple of years, the main reason being their completely different lifestyles, but they keep in touch.  It's J.'s birthday this week. Š.'s come up with a great present idea, and as always, we're getting it for J. together and we're visiting J. on Friday. Herein lies the problem. I'm not really friends with J. anymore. I see her twice or thrice a year, and the get-together is always organised by Š. J. and I have  very  little in common, and we're both aware of that. Yet Š. is completely oblivious to this and even thinks J. and I communicate regularly. Which we don't. We don't hate each other, so I suppose we're just humouring Š. and we all get together a few times a year.  And I wonder - how long will we keep this up?

      I'm exhausted! And I can't blame it on spring (it snowed today).  Working with SCI seems complicated, but also fun! I've already put in about 10 hours and I haven't even done any real work. That starts on Friday! I'm scared to death (I have actual responsibility here! SCI made such a difference in my life, so I have to be careful what I do to other people) but also excited.  The project doesn't seem to be ending. The less said the better.

      S. dropped the bomb that he's coming here in July. Which is great, BUT - I won't be here then. I was sad a bit, and he was super sweet about it, but still... Argh!! I know he doesn't want me to change my plans because of him, and I know I shouldn't, but I think I'm going to look into it.  However... There's also J.  maybe  coming in late July. And I'll probably never meet him unless I'm here then. I'll see S. in Edi anyway.  Shoe shopping today. Not my favourite, but I'm looking forward to it :)

      It's fascinating how we trust people and how we get to it. Today Na. was supposed to pick up those two proof-read articles. I just told her to call when she's in the area and we'd arrange something. She called, we met up, no biggie.  D. however still hasn't called. And I think maybe she won't. The point being that I don't trust her. I know she's a good person, but I guess I just don't know her well enough yet. After all I only met her a week ago.

      I can now apply for exams online, and also check all my grades and everything. The problem is, there are at least two grades missing from that list, and they would be important for my average. Oh well...  D. still hasn't called me. I don't really care, if she calls too late I'll just tell her I can't make it and if tomorrow would be OK.  Getting some Iceland prices now. Easyjet and IcelandExpress aren't cheap, but still a lot cheaper than anything else. Also looks like I might want to spend a day or two in London. Or perhaps Cambridge, it's closer (and cheaper to get to from Stansted). Anyway, this is going to be a very expensive holiday :S

      When I write emails to other organisations, I'm not really supposed to sign my name, because I'm only here a few hours a week. But I've noticed that  when I write nice/happy/good news emails, I sign my name. I hide behind the organisation's name in nasty/unpleasant emails. Considering I'm just a clueless volunteer here, there's no way I'm taking responsibility for stuff no one's trained me for.

      Ta teden me je čas totalno povozil. Že za včeraj sem morala odpovedati službo in se namesto tega voziti čez drn in strn, sonce in točo in do onemoglosti slikati to našo čedno deželico. Potem sem danes cele štiri ure urejala slike (in to povsem brez navdiha) in že spet skoraj morala odpovedati službo za jutri (sem namesto tega odpovedala tiste pol ure faksa), popolne pa vbijam sosedovemu pubertetniku angleščino v glavo.  Potem v četrtek delam in zvečer joga, v petek so celodnevne terenske, v soboto moram napeči par kil piškotov za nedeljo, ko odpeketam v južne kraje. Aja, pa enkrat v tem času moram ugotoviti, kaj naj sploh spakiram, pa dobro bi bilo, če bi mi uspelo priti do rezultatov izpita iz prejšnjega tedna, pa napisati (in nekako oddati) poročilo s terenskih.  Itd. itd.  Da o naslednjem tednu sploh ne govorimo.

      V angleščini mi čisto gre. Pa tudi v slovenščini se še kar znajdem, čeprav mi pogosto zmanjka šumnikov. Preklapljanje med jezikoma je pa precej kruto. Pa kakšen slovenski ekvivalent za  lol  bi prišel prav.

      Izpit čez tri dni. Ne vem, kdaj sem se zadnjih počutila pripravljeno za izpit toliko prej! Na faksu sigurno ne. Mislim, da sem imela enkrat v gimnaziji en preblisk pri slovenščini, ampak takrat je šlo za nekakšen nesporazum. Čudno prečudno.  No, pa en tak zanimiv podatek: ob velikih potresih lahko cela Zemlja vibrira s periodo do 54 minut.

      I have just learned that the exam I was supposed to take next Wednesday has been cancelled. I could take it on 2nd July, but, oops, I'll be in Iceland. Another date then is 2nd September, the day after I return from Edinburgh, so I think better not. Next date after that would then be 23rd September, when, oops, I'm on a boat somewhere in the Adriatic. Not that much of a biggie, I've got another year to pass that exam, but still, makes me feel so useless and  very  unmotivated.  Yes, I will graduate. Some day.  Oh, on a happier note - it also means I'm done with exams for this month :)

"Vot do you mean it'z illegal?" asks the German driver. "Quattro meansa foura," replies the Italian official. "Qvattro is just ze name of ze automobile," the Germans retort, "Look at ze papers: zis car is designt to kerry 5 persons." "You can'ta pulla thata one on me!", replies the Italian customs agent. "Quattro meansa foura. You hava fivea people ina your car and you are thereforea breaking the law."  The German driver replies angrily, "You idiot! Call your zupervisor over, I vant to speak to somevone viz more intelligence!" "Sorry," responds the Italian official, "He can'ta come. He'sa busy with a 2 guys in a Fiat Uno."

      Maybe you've seen it before...  _______________________________________________  A couple from Minneapolis decided to go to Florida to thaw out during one particularly icy winter. They planned to stay at the very same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years earlier. Because of hectic schedules, it was difficult to coordinate their travel schedules. So, the husband left Minnesota and flew to Florida on Thursday, with his wife flying down the following day. The husband checked into the hotel.  There was a computer in his room, so he decided to send an e-mail to his wife. However, he accidentally left out one letter in her email address, and without realizing his error, he sent the e-mail. Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston, a widow had just returned home from her husband's funeral. He was a minister of many years who was called home to glory following a sudden heart attack. The widow decided to check her e-mail expecting messages of condolence from relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she fainted. The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read....  To: My Loving Wife Subject: I've arrived Date: 16 January 2004  I know you're surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now and you are allowed to send e-mails to your loved ones.   I've just arrived, and have been checked in. I see that everything has been prepared for your arrival tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then! Hope your journey is as uneventful as mine was.  P.S. Sure is hot down here! _______________________________________________

      Managed to get that infosheet from .pdf into .txt, so here's another interestig bit about Iceland. And I'm not taking any credit for this, people at  urlLink WF  wrote it with a lot of help from several books (this bit in particular is from  urlLink Xenophobes guide to the Icelanders , I believe).    The hold of the huldufólk   [...]  At a public lecture about the huldufólk, when the speaker asked how many of the audience believed in elves, about 80% of those present raised their hands. Of them 50% had spoken to an elf and 25% had seen one. One man admitted to having made love to an elf (álfur in Icelandic) but it turned out he was hard of hearing and had thought the speaker had been talking about a calf (kálfur).

      I finally received the infosheet for Iceland (I'm going to volunteer there for 2 weeks and travel another 2 weeks). It makes for excellent reading. For example:    How to begin a conversation with an Icelander?   That's easy! You begin by asking, for example, "What is the best way to get to the town of Dalvík?" This is a great beginning because Icelanders love to enlighten others and demonstrate their knowledge. The next question might be, "Is it nice in Dalvík?" The Icelander will most definitely answer, "No, I don't think so, go to Husavík instead. I have a cousin there named Þórður Eðvald, and he's the key man in the City council and..." He'll continue along these lines because Icelanders love to talk about family members and the good connections they have.  Next, you could ask, "How do you pronounce the name Þórður Eðvald?" A whole 20 minutes could go into teaching you how to pronounce the name Þórður Eðvald, including the time it takes to explain how he and Þórður Eðvald are related.   What should I say?   The Icelander will want to know everything about you, that's right, everything: when you were born, the names of your parents, your education, how many siblings you have, work history, etc. Then you get all kinds of questions, such as, "Is your sister married?" or, "Does your father own the company he works at?"  Then the Icelander will ask if you don't think Iceland is beautiful. This you must answer by a "yes" and then praise the country for about 10 minutes or so. Next, the Icelander will try to trick you a little by asking, "But it is cold in Iceland, isn't it?" This is a trap you must not fall into. Your answer, "No, the weather here is wonderful, I love wind and rain."  The Icelander will hardly believe his ears, and will ask with an ironic grin, "It is expensive living in Iceland." You immediately answer, "Expensive here? Nah, it's much more expensive in Tokyo and Oslo. Actually it's not so very expensive in Iceland, no, not at all."  Now you have won. The Icelander is bothe happy and pleased to meet a foreigner who is more Icelandic than he is himself. Yes, it's easy getting to know Icelanders.   There are 25 pages of this stuff :)

      So there I was, avoiding studying by making some more Iceland arrangements. I've already  urlLink mentioned this tour operator , but really I had no idea just why an  urlLink Icelandic tour operator  would offer tours around Iceland, Greenland, The Faroe Islands and beside that Slovenia. I've now figured it out - the director is Slovene, as is another employee.   Founded in 1988 by Helena Dejak, who was born and raised in Slovenia but has lived in Iceland for the past 20 years, Nonni Travel aims to encourage the travel of foreign and Icelandic visitors to the region and can assist other agencies with clients wishing to travel to Iceland or Greenland.   Hmmm, methinks I'm entitled to a big discount. :D (yeah, I wish)

Ženska je strah in trepet študentov (in zaposlenih), zato sem se čez vikend lepo psihično pripravila. Nič pa me ni moglo pripraviti na - do ušes nasmejano tajnico, ki me je prav veselo poslušala in tudi rešila vse zaplete.  Mogoče sem si v 5 letih na tem faksu (!) prislužila nekaj spoštovanja. Ali pa je to znamenje bližajoče se apokalipse. Če bo šlo tako naprej, pri vpisu ne bo več vrste in profesorji bodo ob koncu semestra prirejali vrtne zabave za svoje kolege. Aja, ne, to zadnje je že res!

      After nearly five weeks of planes, trains, buses, bikes, boats and plain feet, after swimming in geothermally heated pools, explosion crater lakes and the Greenland Sea, after about 700 photos (and a broken digital camera display), after about €1700 (rough estimate, don't dare do my finances yet), after a footbal injury, some very unusually nice Icelandic weather and sunny beaches of Funen Island, Denmark, I am now back home. My room is a mess, I don't feel like calling any of my friends, my Slovene seems quite limited at the moment, my great-grandmother died while I was away (two weeks shy of 101 years) and I just don't feel at home yet. But at least hot tap water doesn't smell of sulphur and I have a tan.  Pictures should follow soon :)      urlLink create your own visited country map  or  urlLink write about it on the open travel guide
