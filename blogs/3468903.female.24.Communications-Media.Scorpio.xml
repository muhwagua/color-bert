						   wah this seems all so serious a potential book..novel...DVD COLLECTION!  so lets share. i can share. I am a huge sharereererer.  Lets start from the beginning, wait i changed my mind, my writing professor mentioned something about starting in the middle of things to make things more interesting.  THE MIDDLE LAND OR THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE AS MOST AMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE. wait a second that title is too loong. But its nice to.  i will leave it there. Here we go..I will start again. From somewhere in between Andre 3000 and MR BIG.  BLEEDING THUMBS Moving to california was hard. I have to say, my final days with my mates were spent crying , getting drunk, peeing on the streets of brooklyn  between 2 cars and falling asleep on the fire escape  outside my window will be so engraved on my heart so  much so that even my tattoos will fade faster.  So the morning of my departure from my adobe in Brooklyn can be rivaled to any episode of ER this season. I had my own little punjabi doctor at hand an interesting Noah Wyle in my head and blood , lots of blood. I was trying to fix my glasses in the morning with a nice little fat knife. what follows is alot of blood that is only exxagerated by spit and white washed sinks. Yes you see, its instinctual to stick your bleeding thumb  into your mouth to suck on it when you cut it. but what follows is a mouth full of blood and  a white sink that glows with its presence and contrasts. needless to say, i fainted haha. yes i can laugh now yes i could laugh 3 hours later on the plane being slighty detoured cause of the tornado's in the middle kingdom. My roommate of course saved me picked me up caught me wrapped my thumb tried to induce some 'fucking just stay and miss the flight la' therapy to make it all seem like a distant dream but no i had to be strong it has to happen. So together we trotted to JFK with a mission. To set me and  my bleeding thumb off to the west coast. i did look like i was trying to hitch a ride hahaha  LA LA LAND: yes yes finally here not completely settled down the hardest was letting go my old nyc mobile number. but the beach, material comforts, family and the sun is helping.   BROOKLYN INDUSTRIES: there is this store it sells really cool clothes me and mariana are  mates she works there My constant contact with a stranger  it was nice just having her call and be like so whats the deal ? you moved to california? yes yes my dear mariana, i m oved to cali caliente YOU must miss brooklyn huh she would sing over the phone  between our little pink sweatshirt discussions ( you see i ordered one , but it didn't get there in time) talking to a stranger that suddenly became a friend  half way across the continent of the Universe was so special. NEw yorkers are real. and when they are nice they are. and when they are flaky they are.  LIFE AND EVERYTHING INBETWEEN THE BURRITO: my life has been filled with rooftop parties in brooklyn with beer to  going crazy with my japanese mate in mid town manhattan with wigs on and a camera. New york is the place you can be a million things in a day you can be gay one day and super straight the next but always clean. I am conservative,  but i am also very imaginative.  FORBIDDEN PLANET: I am the luckiest bitch on this planet i lived in NYC for 5 years i spent my early twenties roaming the east village  I grew up in  NYC  if there is a reason to hate me this will be it. I brunch with merly strep while listenning to  the bus boy talk about his gig up with the soros's I got to be dirt poor i got to be dirty I had to live above a night club I got to meet mark walhberg i got to breathe the same air as the beastie boys walk past the bitchy isacc mizrahi got into racial fights and in my final days got the son's landlord  to develope a huge crush on me haha.  ART GALLERIES: so a wanker artist offer me $500 to dance in high heels and a skirt in front of him for an hour( of which i didn't do ,  but lost my job subsequently cause i was working at the gallery  that showed his crap, and i ratted him out like a pigeon on ice cream hahaha) but thats all good. its a laugh. sure i got suckered a million times by a zillion people got into fights with marc jacob store workers even went out with a closet gay. lost shit loads of money on rental got to breathe the post 9-11 air and drink beer on the streets while a small chamber orchestra played on the sidewalk during the Blackout fuck i got to ride the subway with mos def sigh love love love   everything is smeared with crap i learnt how to de crap things  i have learnt to be so many things my final month in brooklyn was wild. dreams  parks museums parties demonstrations just everything  everything that included scared white people too.  but more then anything else in the world. its the music that got me my cd collection my book and comic collection my liberal studies education all those songs  all those words all those images all the politics  LOVE LOVE LOVE and 6 FEET UNDER: so whats next for harpreet. isn't it obvious. i am going to find me a nice indian boy HAHAHAH ok seriously. i am going to be a stubborn ass motherfucker and try and get me a job in the worst recessions in middle land with inflation up , unemployment at 6% and gas costing as much as a kidney. what else do i need but a stubborn obsessive depressing state of mind to get something out of this life. Love is something in my life but it is purely between me ,my mum and my X5.

						   Tuesday was one of the nicest days I can remember having in a long, long time...perhaps even the nicest day I've ever had here in San Francisco...it's funny because I really didn't do anything great at all...went to Golden Gate Park in the afternoon...found a nice spot near a pond - ducks, tortoises, pigeons, flowers, trees, clear sunny sky...put a blanket down and just laid there for hours drifting in and out of my slumber while Iris read a book...opened my eyes and saw a squirrel scamper right up to me, stopping a few times to stare before coming closer still...it came all the way up to me and touched my hand which had been extended out, then ran away...felt like I was in some Disney cartoon...it went down towards a bench where 2 dudes were sitting and it jumped onto the back of the chair...the guy turned around and freaked, which was the funniest thing ever! big muscular run literally jumping out of his seat because of a squirrel...I laughed 'til tears came running down my face...around 6pm, and we're still lying there, I hear a sound so I open my eyes and what do I see? 2 feet away from me is a fox!  it was standing there just looking at us...I woke Iris up, and she got the shock of her life...the fox then walked away a few steps, stopped looked at us again, walked away some more then stopped to look at us again before disappearing into the bushes...didn't even know there were foxes in SF...do believe its the first time I've seen one in the flesh/fur...around 6.30 it started getting cold so we packed up...as I'm folding the blanket, Iris runs down to the pond and starts chasing the ducks and pigeons...chasing the way only little kids do, running to the left, then right, flapping her arms about and trying to actually catch one...smiled for a bit then wondered whatever happened to MY inner child? being so jaded and cynical myself,it was nice to know that there are still people like that in the world...and that was my day...funny how a day of nothing can be so amusing...maybe i'm just getting old..and soft...oh well..que sera sera...

						   I started this blog so that all of us could record the thoughts, feelings and experiences we go through while weâ€™re in our twenties. I wanted to compile these stories and maybe build it into a script, a novel or whatever in the near future. Iâ€™m waiting for a big kick in the arse to help me realise that dream of immortalising us (our group of friends) on a four-DVD set of 24 episodes ala FRIENDS.   We lead two different lives â€“ one that our parents share with us, and the other that is our own. The latter is where we make our most insane and irrational decisions, and make our stupidest mistakes without anyone harping over your shoulder reminding you what an idiot you were. This is where weâ€™re allowed to learn from those bad experiences and be supportive of each other to not go down that road again. And your friends who know the two different  you s and never judge. They offer opinions and suggestions now and then, but they never pretend they know better. They just let you know that they know as much as you do, but might have taken a different route.  Thatâ€™s how I feel about the friends I have today. I donâ€™t go a day without wondering what one is up to â€“ I can only think of one at a time okay â€“ and I thank God for letting each of them into my life. I donâ€™t write to them all the time, sometimes ever. Itâ€™s really nothing personal. I write everyday for a living so sometimes I just have nothing to say or havenâ€™t enough words left to say it. At my job, I write other peopleâ€™s stories, reflections and what nots. With this blog, I can write mine and my friendsâ€™.

						   Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice With a step to your left and a flick to the right you catch that mirror way out west You know you're something special and you look like you're the best  Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand Just like that river twisting through a dusty land And when she shines she really shows you all she can Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande  I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV Two of a billion stars it means so much to me Like a birthday or a pretty view But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you  Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand Just like that river twisting through a dusty land And when she shines she really shows you all she can Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande  Hey now woo look at that did she nearly run you down At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive You make me feel alive, alive alive I'll take my chance cause luck is on my side or something I know what you're thinking I tell you something I know what you're thinking  Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand Just like that river twists across a dusty land And when she shines she really shows you all she can Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grand Her name is Rio she don't need to understand And I might find her if I'm looking like I can Oh Rio, Rio hear them shout across the land From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grande Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

						   I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been You held this letter probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it didn't have a camera by my side this time hoping I would see the world through both my eyes maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way with words TODAY skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche' And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky are next to mountains anyway Didn't have a camera by my side this time Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way but let me say You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes it brought me back to life You'll be with me next time I go outside NO more 3x5's  I Guess you had to be there I Guess you had to be with me  Today I finally overcame tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame Maybe I will tell you all about it when I'm in the mood to lose my way but let me say You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes it brought me back to life You'll be with me next time I go outside no more 3x5's just no more 3x5's

						   Finally I figured out how to submit an entry! I've always asked Jason to deal with the 'computer' stuff, cause it was just more convenient...and now I'm left behind. Hehe, yeah, blame Jason!  We bought some cool lights in Sydney when we were over there last May. (Its so cool, will try to submit a photo of it) So after leaving it for 3 weeks(think its going to be 4 now) we finally ran out of excuses and decided to put it up. As I got the ladder, coughed my lungs out because -damn - those lights were dusty, I realised...we can't put it up yet. The wires are too long! And we didnt know how to cut it to adjust it to right height. All this while we just rolled up the wires and binded it with yucky duct tape. Black yucky duct tape (the lights are white) And at that time we thought, who cares..we were bachelors after all. Everyone else doesnt have an apartment, and the ones that did, well, their apartments sucked. But now, we wanted 'nice' lights. And I thought boys knew things like this. Isnt this why I got married? Felt a bit cheated! :)  Anyway, I reacted positively and immediately as a responsible married adult...I called my mum. She has all the numbers la! So my dear Uncle Kumar came over to do what we all learnt in Kemahiran Hidup years ago, and it took him all of 2 minutes. We felt extremly foolish but we kept a stupid sheepish smile plastered on our face the whole time he was over. I think I even caught him stifling a laugh. I was glad it didnt take long. I felt so embarrassed. As he left I apologised for wasting his time. But secretly, who cares. We got out lights up! We got our lights up! And it looks good!

						   i was the first to sign up after jacq and eagerly anticipated writing something called 'the first post' but suffered a huge wave of uninspiration and left it to harpreet to pip me to the post.  so with that in mind, i shall try again...  worked at the shop on saturday, eventhough i now have a full-time job now.  i bought a pair of shoes on sale that rubbed parts of my feet raw, but still hobbled along in the name of fashion.  i then went to meet up with an ex for his birthday but caught the bus too far and had to limp along in the cold, saying fucking fuck fuck fuck out-loud the entire way back.  i then had to endure his drug-hazed dissection of a letter sent to him by his old girlfriend as well as a description of the random girls he had been shagging.  today was an improvement - i cooked pumpkin and red lentil soup as well as a bastardised lamb saag.  practiced putting and chipping at the driving range so watch out annika...  filled the bath-tub right up to the top, read jane austen and wished for a mr darcy of my own.  also - thinking of taking a few pole-dancing classes for fun... any feedback?

						   i had the best few days last weekend.   there was a public holiday on the monday and i was determined "to do stuff". saturday i potted around the house, watched three hours of cooking shows, took myself off to oxford street and prowled round the second hand-shops. i picked up two dresses from the 70s and an italian silk top, all for around $60. then i went off to a spa and had a massage, frittering away my first pay-check. the next day i went to bondi beach with my friend, ray, and had the most incredible eggs benedict with smoked salmon. poked around a second hand book-shop and came away with a book of southern cooking and 'crime and punishment'.  i'm too afraid i'll get addicted to fried chicken. wandered around the markets where ray picked up some head-gear which is a cross between a cap and a beanie and bought a hammock. i found a bright-blue vintage dress with jewels round the neck. after that we hit some golf balls at the driving range... slowly getting better.  everyone else was amused by the chick in the hot pink t-shirt, denim mini and brown boots. we then headed off to the pub to watch australia play scotland.  we kicked ass but it was a pretty ordinary game. monday i cooked a mean chicken biryani and had the gang over for lunch.  em was curled up on the couch with her new man while ray and geoff were playing indoor cricket and tennis with some kiddies' beach toys in the living room.  i got hit on the head by an errant ball.  no damage done, i think. played some pool, drank a few beers, watched crap sunday nite tv, fell asleep contented.

						   i used to walk to school everyday..took about 15mins..after a while i got kind of malas, coz its really cold in the mornings and i'm still not quite awake...anyway, there's a streetcar/train that passes not 200 yards from my house, and passes by school on its way downtown...it costs $1.25 to ride the train regardless if you ride for 1 minute or 40...i found out that you could ride the streetcar for free if you just climbed in the backdoor of the second car, so being cheap thats what i did...what i do is stand about 50yards away from the trainstop..when people get in from the front i jump in the back...if ever the ticket agents come looking you just pull the string and jump off at the next stop...  anyway, 50yards away from the trainstop where i stand is a barbershop..i'm kinda paranoid about getting crapped on by birds so i stand right at the barbershop window, under the awning shade...  now every monday i have class at 12pm, so usually by 11.40 i'm standing there waiting for the train...last day of class this sem happened to be on the 24th of may, however, because iris was here visiting, i finished my project and handed it in earlier so i wouldn't have to turn up for class that day...so anyway, i'm sitting in my room on the 24th at around 11.30 - 11.45 when i hear gunshots...i'm like 'yea,whatever' its been kind of a usual thing lately...  around 12.30, we're going out downtown and we walk down to the trainstop..when we get there there's cops and ambulances, and tv crew all over the place...turns out the barbershop got hit by a drive-by...some gang related stuff...  as i stood there standing and staring at the bullet holes in the wall and the barbershop window, i couldn't help but think 'damn, if she didn't come visit, i'd probably be going to school today, and i'd probably have been standing right there'...how bizarre would that have been..getting shot on your last day of school...like god playing some sick twisted joke on me..'congratulations, you finally graduated - BANG!BANG!'   i really should move out of this neighbourhood.  END.

						   some people were born without rhythm.  meet marcus. he's big, he's clumsy but he's determined. he's shasha's salsa classmate.  i met him at her dancing school's party and even though the other students were dancing circles around him, he boldly asked me, a complete stranger "do you want to salsa?" i blushed cause i was the only non-student there, but hey i was there, so why not.i said "yes".   so we start dancing and me being nervous about not knowing the steps tried to distract him by talking continuously.  only marcus didnt look up and he didnt say anything back. i was a little confused and thought maybe he didnt hear me, but before i could repeat myself, i heard him whisper "1-2-3-4". The poor boy was counting! It made me giggle a little - i know, i'm mean- but secretly i was like *yay, i'm not so bad after all*.  anyway, about 4 painful minutes later the song ended and i thanked him for the dance. i also secretly thanked him for proving to me that courage still exists and determination could put you through the most embarassing moments.  marcus if you ever read this - thank you and i will see you in class! yes folks he has convinced me to release the salsa queen in me!  Ole!

						   when i was very young, the one thing that drove me towards having dreams/ambitions or even finding out what that meant was just to prove to my father that i could be better than him. that i was infact better than him.   my father wasnt the toyads, ramly's or amminuddins of this universe. infact if you called the affectionate and supportive section of the universe, he wouldnt be there. at least he wouldnt be there for me. he was always too busy with his students or was always so absored with the only thing that seemed to matter...st johns, that he didnt have time for anything else..for me.  so i knew that whatever i did in life, it would be so that i wouldn't be him. i would do more with my life, i would travel, i would love and be loved, especially by my family, and most of all i would inspire those around me. it didnt have to be big, but it had to mean something to someone.  its been a while since i've thought about all that. i haven't revisited the hatred i kept for my dad, for a long time now. i havent buried it either, but i'm lucky i've been busy, and havent had the time to think about it. infact although our relationship has improved since i got married, i've just been too lazy to 'update' how i feel about my dad now. too lazy to think about it.  until last saturday. i had an outdoor shoot at a vintage car show. i was with my producer joe jer when i met one of joshua's friends. joe jer's convinced that i know the entire KL.. the truth is most of them are from st john's so they know me. anyway, he introduced me to the other car owners and i started talking to this weird looking guy. half way through our conversation joshua's friend said "this is 'vincent's daughter', and then the conversation just stirred towards my dad  and st johns (JOY). he couldnt stop talking to me. it felt weird not because it hadnt happen before- quite the contrary, people seem to feel like they have to say something to me - but because i didnt particularyly like discussing about my father.  then in the blur of what he was saying, he said "your dad really meant something to us". i snapped out of my own thoughts and really looked at him... "who was this guy".. and then it didnt matter. for the first time in a long time i was forced to think about what he said and what that meant to me. i realised that the man i thought of as self absorbed and cold for all these years, was to this man, an inspiration.who would have thought.   still - i dont know how i feel about it all. but one thing is for sure, if some years from now a complete stranger told my kids that i meant something to them, i would have at come close to being what he was to others.

						   so i will write. write about boys write about sports write about life AND TELL PEOPLE THAT ITS actually the LA Losers not the LA LAkers. and this 'lap' that i talk of isn't that of my brothers. it is of someone i would rather not name  or think about again. haha   i went to the beach today, alone the weather was nice but the seagulls smelly and rather noisy. the beach was a buzz about the game i wish i had a piston bag or something haha would have made for a great scene. one little indian girl and a bunch of fake titties trying to wrestle but you know i will be enjoying the bounce anyone would. its so much like playing with rubber balls i imagine would make for an interesting fight.  (the lakers aren't going to win. the east is mightier then the west in some cases, sorry)haha $50 bucks say the pistons take the league.  the sand was hot so i sat right near where the ocean spits itself on you but not too close  but close enough that i could be cooled every now and then.  the sun was shiny. I got burnt.bad.  nothing that hurts terribly though. quite a nice numb red look i wear hahaha like a fish that hasn't lost her colour out of water, or an indian lobster whichever. you know lobsters mate for life.   i am contemplating travelling maybe i will go home for a bit. my heart seems to have slipped off the road somewhere. am aimlessly and silently searching for its ridiculous slimy self. its a rather messy situation. my organs are getting really angry at me i selfishly let it roam barren blood. anyway i have a ticket but, no 'Will' to leave, but knowing me i will cave in to my own demise.  life is easier to swallow after all, with some 'friends' over  beer. a right hand drive and some spare bribing change for the cops  besides i can't fathom being here if my brother is away. i wouldn't know what to do.   i was going to keep it short but again my will is failing me this narcisistic quality behind writing is far to intoxicating.  it has been a terrible time i will be lying if i say otherwise i can't imagine that i would be sad thought i would be happy if i had a BMW.   i would be lying if i say that i have never seen someone i 'like' and 'didn't have' or had for that matter go home with someone else but it was hard. it isn't easy i can hear you saying 'that's how life is la!' yes, i do realise this i have lived life unfortunately in most unreasonable cases.  i met this lady on memorial day. i was ready to rip her head off and kick it like ronaldo how dare someone say anything about my brother about anything and sit comfortably on a lap that i was kicked off from. i am only human you know. actually i felt like crap that i didn't slam her head on my knee i really should have defended my brother far more then i meekly attempted to even though she was drunk she is magnificently rude i have never met anything like her granted i felt terrible for her at the same time cause she obviously has some super issues...   i have a great huge inner child  but i am not to be regarded as one.   infatuation: 1.	A foolish, unreasoning, or extravagant passion or attraction. See Synonyms at love. 2.	An object of extravagant, short-lived passion   lets get on with life as it leads itself. its always a wonder how nothing always matters, don't you reckon. now this is silly! haha   'This is not a coincidence And far more than a lucky chance But what is that was always meant'-steviewondersome.

						   Friends, please let not this blog be turned into an online message board. And stop with the song lyrics!! San, you're the only guy because the other boys I invited have not accepted the invitation to the blog. It's not gay - you're just emotionally advanced. I'm giving out an assignment now to set some order in this verbal chaos - "Lull". Write. That's it.

						   I wanna give two thumbs up to Mandela's Long Walk to Freedom and to Calvin & Hobbes' Something is Drooling Under My Bed...both excellent choices...I would also like to suggest Grimm's Grimmest and How to Be A Villain...  Also wondering why is it that I'm the only guy on this blog thingy? Too gay...  And when did this become a lyric bank? Please stop it! But of course, not wanting to be left out of everything ridiculous, here's my two cents...  Don't Take Your Love Away - Avant  After the hopin and prayin and the wishin Girl you're right here in my face I've never been the one to bite my tongue But I have not one word to say I'm mesmerized by your sexy eyes And your soft and lovely skin I want this fiasco to end So baby we can start all over again  Listen I wanna be able I wanna be able to love you, oh I I wanna be able And let me be the one to please you, oh I As sure as the sun shines all over the earth You're one of God's most precious works See I'm a man and we make mistakes But please don't take your love away, oh I  Don't take your love away Baby don't take your love away from me I need you girl Don't take your love away Don't take your love away Don't take your love away Baby don't take your love away from me I need you Don't take your love away baby  Mama said don't put your hands in the cookie jar She said, "Son, have control" She said everything thats that's sweet ain't good for you, no And everything that glitters ain't gold And now that you're gone I realize I've lost my soul And I don't wanna pass the torch Baby can you give me one more chance  See girl I know that I hurt you so With all those girls that were in my world Stacy and Kim, damn all of them Girl I wanna give you everything I can I know you're tired of my games, Tired of my lies Baby this time I promise it'll be alright No longer will you be lead astray Baby listen to the words I say  END.

						   i think my best guy friend is in love with me  how awkward  here i was thinking i had the perfect no-strings relationship  ie that we could do all the couple-things without the "OTHER" things which i can't ever imagine doing with him  which begs the question... how do you tell someone that you're not attracted to him?  in fact today he sent me an sms asking if we had kissed last night  my response: NO!  he said it must have been a pretty good dream then...

						   at about 7pm, it began to rain but the chaos in the house had been going on for about a week now. the builders were banging away at the pelamin,the tent wasn't up yet, kids were screaming, bunga telur yet to be done, the 'bilik pengantin' were having some problems with the flowers. sigh. i was dying to get away but at least jason was around, it made it easier for me. especially when there were a million people i didnt know (so called relatives) telling me what I had to do as the bride to be - like insisting that i 'inai' my hands (yuck) - he held my hand, and offered a reassuring smile.  Be patient.   Still i felt like i needed to get away. And so when Shasha offered to take me for a drive, I was more than glad to leave the mad house for a while. Little did I know the drive was the beginning of my hour long fairytale proposal.   Shasha led me to Bart; he was waiting at the first place Jason and I met. *Haagen Dazs* although its some Japanese restaurant now. Then Bart passed me the next "clue" which led me to Rina, Farez & Naz, sitting at the mamak where Jason and I used to have dinner everynight while still working at the Blue Banana.   It was all so exciting, not only that the proposal modelled after my favourite reality show "The Amazing Race" but that Jason had gotten everyone involved. It was still raining, and this time heavier. But I didnt care.   The next few clues led me to a VCD guy, JacQ and finnaly to Jasmin's. JacQ took me there blindfolded and when I got there Jason greeted me.  "hello babe". Still blindfolded, he led me to her beautiful gazebo and as I took off the blindfold, there he was, handsome in his tux, down on one knee, surrounded by candles and rose petals everywhere. And  he was holding the most beautiful ring I had ever seen.   And even though I knew what was going on, I didnt expect it. And I didnt expect tears to flow down that easily either. You see, I had already given up on him proposing. (it was one of those "let's get married" talks instead of a proposal, but he had promised to propose anyway ) But he did. He pulled it off, and he got everyone involved. (jacq, rina, shasha, darna, naz, farez, jasmin, bart - how can we thank you??!!!)  And 6 months to the date I still can't beleive, we're married. And if I had to go through the drama again, I would, only because ..its Jason la. Who wouldnt? :)  Happy 6th month Anniversary sayang!

						   my innocence will pull me through.   Yes i felt like i had to start off  with the police.  OUR WEEKEND VALENTINE: stuck on the Denalli's front window was our little valentine. guiding us to Las vegas Our little own funny valentine. The valentine is a little radar/ police vibes detector it tells us to slow the fuck down if there is a cop near by even in our bumper to fucking bumper journey to Nevada we had our trusty valentine and a canvas of the milky way on our midnight drive. It seemed almost ideal for all the  boys in the car. their valentine would normally be trusted while they spit around the freeways in LA in their Nissan Z's and their SL 55's. while i dream of stars.  To me it was a rude awakening to what people really care about their cars and their police tickets  haha yes it is properly named. but we all know that no one on the AutoBann needs one they go through far more vigorous driving exams then most people in the world license's to love don't come too easily THERE perhaps?  GETTING MY PAPERS: i passed my driving test. You take your own car and you drive around with a tester and well if the conversation goes well you pass. I guessed he figured i wouldn't drive like a fuck wit in a nice car...hhmm  I passed. with a mere 6 points off. funny that was what i lost in my written test (passing for that means you can only get 6 wrong ;) )  LOST VEGAS: there is a reason that fear and loathing in las vegas was made. Without any form of drug induction  you can't fucking swallow vegas.  I LOST MY PANTS: I lost money I got my card declined...more then once .... I insulted a black jack dealer cause he took it all away at 2.30 am. they pump oxygen into the air in the casino's it is the most disgusting thing on earth i felt like i had a heat stroke and was being mugged willingly all in a day, while encapsuled in some form of altitude sickness contraption.  107 degrees out: i bought a bikini and jumped into the hotel pool  It is hell on earth. Vegas is tits ass and every other imaginable sin and sine for sale. prostitution is far from being illegal.  LOVE: I have finally come to terms with this I have finally come to terms with the fact that I love someone  that isn't a family member or a dear friend and it makes me feel like death is following me around.   LOVE AGAIN: O why do i think its love well i think its love because no matter how much i want to not love him i do. I think its love cause it is peculiar. Its peculiar because he isn't cute he isn't the harpreet cookie cutter cute he is like that one thing I grew up knowing for certain I wouldn't love and then one day I woke up  and the only thing I was so sure off crumbles right before you. thats how it happened. one day you wake up and you aren't fearsome of your own death but completely freaked out with the prospect of losing this one thing you were sure you would never like, but end up loving and losing him to something out of your control perhaps , is quite certain.  whether it be death or not.  SILENT ALL THESE YEARS: I have always been able to  talk about the loves in my life quite easily like a meal that i had for lunch but these few weeks this silence this quietness is very much the loudest thing in my head it has inhibited and inhabitated me it is far too fearful for me to bring any light to it. i don't know why. it feels like its the last straw for me and i am afraid if this love wrecks it will wreck me like no other its going to be the one that makes my mind up about too many simple things in life.  DRAMATICS: realising how awfully dramatic this all seems but really all i feel like doing is telling my mother 'mum, i am in love with him and i don't know  how to handle? cause i want to spend the rest of my life with him.' but i am too afraid to say this i am too afraid to be a woman that is going to get her heart broken. no amount of degree's knowledge or money if going to get me this love i desire. only luck. and well considering how much was lost in vegas i have no luck. I don't want the comfort from her i just want the maths i want to know how to get through my days and not even bother with this thought of love that i feel for this boy who everyone in my family knows  eiik  i can't believe this i can't believe i am in love with this person. it hurts that i love the beasts of my life. when all i want to do is kiss him and hold his hand  when things are rough.  This life we lead is very precious i know this i have seen this. the barbershop was always around the block or 1.5 miles away.  and i always mean what i say and i rarely say mean things.  but what about this thing that means so much to me how do i handle this meaning in my life.  with all my 8 hours of sleep this weekend i think i will go to bed. and regroup and hopefully wake up in the morning put on my bikini and shorts hop on to my red bike and cycle the coasts of the beach with less of a soul cause its easier to bare it that way during the day.  but i have to say. the shopping in vegas was great regardless of the declining credit.;) when there is a sale there is a way.

						   I’m one of those people who hide the fact that I like fussing over my appearance. Infact when I’m applying lipstick in the ladies before I leave work, and someone barges in, I get embarrassed and try to quickly hide my lipstick. Almost like I don’t want to admit that my lips arent naturally rosy :).  However, that being said, I also don’t like spending too much time on how I look and because of that; I like to give myself limits on what I would do. eg, I don’t mind the occasional visit to the hairdressers to get a trim or wash etc, or the when-I-have-money trip to the nail studio and only lipstick/blusher during weekdays.  But recently Shasha’s been bugging me about getting my upper lip hairs removed. Actually she’s been bugging me for quite a while now.  And to tell you the truth, I didn’t even notice that people were removing their upper lip hairs until she brought it to my attention. I mean why bother and serious who cares. So no matter how persistent she was I didn’t relent. It hadn’t been an issue before and I will not let it bother me now. I will not succumb to yet another one of society’s necessary ‘do’s’.  Unfortunately God put a certain woman by the name of Aunty Viji in my life. And she has the thickest mustache I’ve ever seen on a woman.I've known her since I was a kid, but I hadnt seen her since I was about 10 and coincidentally I bumped into her recently. She really is the nicest person in the world, but God, that mustache! I try not to look at it whenever we speak, but my eyes just cant keep away. Those things are like a fridge and me; magnets.  So today, virgin ‘threadee’ me went down to Bangsar. Put 20 cents in the meter and that bought me 15 minutes. (who says you can't buy time)  Went in and the lady wasn’t there yet so I had to wait. Fortunately I met Shasha's cousin Amee there. Go figure - her family must be the reason that place is expanding. Amee talked me through the process –she’s been there many times apparently.  The 'thread lady' walked in 15 minutes later and I was 5th in line. Nobody yelled out in pain so I didn’t think it was going to be that bad. Finally I sit in the chair, tilt my head back and shut my eyes. Suddenly I feel this mini lawnmower on my upper lip. *OUCH* it fuckin' hurt man! And I tell you it’s a lie when they say it only takes 'a moment', because it felt like forever. I was still wincing in pain and about to get off my seat when she proceeded to do my eyebrows. *OUUCH. MOTHE F%^&*$*. I guess because I didn’t say anything she thought I wanted them done too. There were tears people!  I got off the seat and looked in the mirror expecting to seem my eyebrows all thin and weird but instead I was impressed. It actually looked good. Infact they were perfect, better than anything I’d ever done. And even though it feels like my upper lip is wider now because it’s lost all its cover, it isn’t. And yes, I know that besides Shasha, I will probably be the only one who will notice the difference. Still it made me feel good.   Unfortunately, it’s the start of a routine I will be forced to keep up every week or so. Luckily it only costs RM8. ( that is, minus the parking ticket I got cause my meter ran out)

						   the crows are here. its garbage day today.  those words just crept into my head this morning and i thought it sounded quite....poetic  i guess in a terribly dark smelly way.  I have become prone to emotional rollercoasters everytime i hear the words New York City or Brooklyn it feels like there is this huge gaping hole in my soul its really quite ridiculous cause i know i am going to be  in my life  constantly prone to being a nomadic soul  I think because of my super urge to be rooted has consequently been usurped by the  powers to be  hence the lets shift her from gear to gear and she how long her  shafts lasts. haha sorry for that mildly obscene analogy and the lack of car part knowledge. i go with what sounds good sometimes.  I had some weird dreams last night it was such a restless one  i dreamt i steped on broken pieces of glass and spent a good time in my dream picking a small peice out of my heel and collecting tiny specs of glass off the floor. HOW disturbing huh.  so needless to say i was up and about rather early. had so many things to do and just needed to get them done.  Everyone that cares keep reminding me that i have only  been searching for a job for 2 weeks or so but i guess i am a closet perfectionist and its just really bothering me that i have nothing to do and no job and income to squander.  Many a things have brought me to the dictionary i think this has to be my all time favourite book in the world. the Oxford dictionary. if you look up certain words and put them into context in your life you will come out somewhat  clear headed about the most ambiguious things.  Like if you were ever in doubt about what a friend is, when in doubt. look it up.   1.	A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts. 2.	A person whom one knows; an acquaintance. 3.	A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade.  Word History:  A friend is a lover, literally.  The relationship between Latin amcus “friend” and am “I love” is clear, as is the relationship between Greek philos “friend” and phile “I love.”   .*In English, though, we have to go back a millennium before we see the verb related to friend.  At that time, frond, the Old English word for “friend,” was simply the present participle of the verb fron, “to love.”  The Germanic root behind this verb is *fr-, which meant “to like, love, be friendly to.”  Closely linked to these concepts is that of “peace,” and in fact Germanic made a noun from this root, *frithu-, meaning exactly that.  Ultimately descended from this noun are the personal names Frederick, “peaceful ruler,” and Siegfried, ”victory peace.”  The root also shows up in the name of the Germanic deity Frigg, the goddess of love, who lives on today in the word Friday, “day of Frigg,” from an ancient translation of Latin Veneris dis, “day of Venus.”>- source www.dic.com   a friend is: 1. One who entertains for another such sentiments of esteem, respect, and affection that he seeks his society aud welfare; a wellwisher; an intimate associate; sometimes, an attendant.  Some friendship will it [a hovel] lend you gainst the tempest. --willyShakespear.(king lear)    don't you reckon this is rather interesting don't you think if you were at odds with yourself about what things mean, this could realistically and literally put things into perspective. all but willy that is.  Now to take you down harpreet's little nebula of thoughts. you could only truly define the word love, with its children eros and philia, if you are confused by the term that they use.   and then you can go on with your everydays of things. with logic and a needless head.   so now i have to call all my  friends in NYC and beg them  to come down this weekend cause i am as bored as already digested food and i want to get tipsy and talk New york nonsense with them,  which compared to LA nonsense is fucking pulizter prize winning stuff man. even when everyone on the table in brooklyn aren't speaking the same language. but i am a suicidal romantic when it comes to  things of such  nature.  victory can be declared.   now to go soak in the tub cause i have the time to do so. haha San, you should come too!!!! you are so near.

						   my only source of entertainment these days is memsahib Prerana ,my 15.5 year old cousin leaves for bombay today.  she called me minutes ago to say bye. she is sweet she teases me about being skinny and i tease her about being stupid we get on very well.   Her best friend is/was down from Bombay Koell. She is a year older then Miss P and she and I share the same birthday.  the three of us got our face painted in Universal ( after of an hour of me begging them to ) and we walked around Disney land Queenly with four dollar tiara's on our heads  I guess i just wanted to share  with you the small things that can make you(as in me)  really feel light and just so touched and loved of which comes from that call for your littlest  cousin from the airport to say bye  ,  she KNOWs i will Miss her and i just have to know that Koell is wearing her Tiara  all the way to Bombay.  it just made my silly day.  I think i have a knack for making teenagers comfortable being kids. guess i make quite a good role model lets follow the big kid and be a kid type role model.  Groovy is gone to KL, he calls from the airport to tell me my friend is flying the plane. silly fucking day.  In the last month we got into 2 major fights we had our second one last night and i hate being mad or fighting with someone who is getting on a plane or going away. I don't like bad vibed good byes its not good for the soul. so i sucked it up as much as i could and forgot the whole thing as much as i could.  i drove around abit today too had a conversation with a fellow driver with my hands and eyes. it is so interesting how californians communicate between their cars.  love me.

						   CLARITY FROM A FAT COMIC NAMED M.CHO. there are those very few times you find yourself straddling a single seater two wheel contraption uncomfortably down paths through parking lots up and down pedestrian infested streets frowning with irritation and in the verge of tears cause of the fucking solitude that surrounds you while the rest of your shorts are up your ass crack. then you get strange surfie checking you out and saying hello and your energy switches back and forth from pussy to brain nice exercising in californiaing.  My rides have become comfortable, to a point. granted that i unconciously turn the handle bars of my moving contraption towards on coming traffic, overtakers, or people. its like the basic concept that because i should be avoiding them comes into my head so intensely that for some reason my dyslexic logic makes me go head on towards it. I am constantly playing chicken with myself even when i don't want to play. this it seems to be the analogy my old gay housemates use to explain my long lasting one night sexual affairs that and constantly having to wash my sheets. i will always be afraid of cooties !!!  SCRABBLE , FEET FETISHES MASTURBATION AND EPIPHANIES: I have been slowly unpacking very slowly. I found some old pictures from 6 years ago. I found my scrabble set. Tired to play a game with Me , Myself and I. But i got it all mixed up on the sixth round. this is when i thanked god that it doesn't work that way with masturbating.  I found my DVD's. I have to make a note that I have one DVD that i haven't completely seen. I remember not being able to finish it, or go past more then 20 minutes of it cause there was TOO MUCH SEX! Yes it is as ridiculous as this. I think in my years of being a stupid conservative shit aka i didn't want to fuck an african american who kept putting off getting tested thinking i would cave in willy nilly to his godness gracious cock made me fly away from anything that could possibly send blood rushing to my down belows. Maybe, just fucking maybe  i would have come out of it just not being turned on or thinking of sex. but i know me and thats not possible cause things linger in my head for years and months so forget about me forgeting a woman being fucked in St lucia. Nope, i don't have the self control most people do in that section of life, Ironically. It far more simpler to being turned on and refusing sex then it is to being turned on and just not having sex. man, i think i went out with this dude cause i knew i would never fuck him. god what was wrong with me! haha terrified of being hurt i guess physically and emotionally.  maybe if he didn't like licking...NO frenching my feet and toes soo much i would have, or maybe if i trusted him, i so didn't i would have. (REason why not to let something like foot licking to bother you too much: cause you get a damned good pre foot massage. and in NY you can really use one of those sometimes, you can politely dismiss his toe touching as simple foot massage and leave his apartment. I think i was a foot whore. shit i feel so SHOED.  ohh god eeeeew.  But back to sex and lucia. I didn't want to watch people fucking..and really it looked like that was all they were going to be doing I can't remember the beginning or much of the movie that i didn't watch  but i remember thinking oh k..when are they going to start being real. Its cinematography is awesome thats why shizuka made me buy it she said i would love it but i didn't think that the philosophy of the whole movie was to surround the concept that people fucking is merely a glimpse of paradise exagerated on screen and edited to suit willy nilly. and only happens when your life is on a holiday. but this idea is premature i haven't seen the movie haha maybe i will watch it it will be seen.  ON BEING A WOMAN: I don't identify with this aspect on being a woman i don't play the same games i don't do the movie type things i don't say the same things and unfortunately i don't always know what they do. i can honestly say the only time i can identify with being a woman is when some women talk about not having an orgasm everytime they have sex. Thats when my eyes light up and i smile at being able to proclaim to myself majestically that I am a woman!  i am an insecure woman But i am a confident person. I can't seem to put the person that i am and the woman i was born to be in the same handbag carrying confidence knock off Hermes. As a woman i feel like i have failed the sex of myself in many ways. for instance...  IN LOVE: When I am in love I am stubborn and stubborn is almost always construed as stupid and walk-all-over-her-able. or a member of the  'its ok to be rude cause she likes you' club.  I don't stalk like i used to infact i have had the pleasure of being on the other end and shit if anyone tells you its a pain in the ass to be stalked HAH they are fucking lying! it was awesome I saw this scary creature lurking in my neighbourhood always there to carry my laundry up the 3 flights of stairs to my apartment. It was damn fuckin useful man.  BUt I have failed as a woman because woman don't stalk. women don't stalk because be it as it may in whatever century you live in , woman who stalk are crazy. Men do the clubbing and dragging into cave, not the women. and if the women do they are in a movie called swimfan , crush or fatal attraction and in most cases far more uglier then the pretty desirable girlfriend the stalked man comes equiped with. FOr years i have been fighting this nonsense of what i presumed is sexist why the fuck can't i club some motherfucker and drag him into the cave for a good ancient ritual and keep him there!! why the fuck do i need his fucking consent! yes i sound like a fucking cocknapper-rapist.  What i mean to say is that we all think of great amazing tales and theories relating to every fucking thing in the world but what it is really all about is Sex, pleasure, narcisium,contentment and company. the whole world revolves around these things.  STORY BOOK PLAYING IN MY HEAD: I gave some dork my number last night now i feel bad cause i was flirting with him cause i wanted to feel better I wanted to know i could do it I hope he doesn't call But maybe i am also being naive at thinking he will call.  ON BEING IN LOVE AND PMSING: I have come to the conclusion thankfully that life is really simple If you like someone and they like you back its all good but if he doesn't you are allowed to feel shitty but don't waste too much time feeling shitty cause you will not laugh as much as you used to and laughing is the most precious thing in the world. There is a way to make everything better in life Laughter And if you can find a way to laugh about all your miseries you will sleep better and you really won't let assholes have an oportunity to be assholes. Don't every short change oneself no matter how much you find. cause you know what god  made it possible for you to masturbate all by yourself , even wrap your arms around yourself completely,feed yourself ,literature and the ability for inner dialogue haha. and if God gave us all of this then you have no reason to feel incomplete. but by all  means feel shitty, cause just like how the sky looks bluer when someone goes down on you it can look green when you are alone as hell.

						   Okay, so I've been MIA for a bit. I apologise. It started when my editor, Joan told me about over two months ago that she was leaving the magazine to go to NST. It was already an editorial team of two, and it has now gone down to one. I'm happy for her because it's something she wants to do - to revamp the paper that gave her her first job for the first nine years of her career. Yesterday was her last day- and so now i am a lost ship with no lighthouse. Not totally lost - i have direction. Just need a little guidance. Apparently life doesn't come with a road map. &nbsp; Apart from that i've been struggling to close the August issue and get a head start on the September issue just so that I can make this trip to Spain. Everytime I come home from work my mind is numb and I can hardly think. So i watch a little  Charmed  and  Buffy  and any other cheesy TV show to sort of numb it even further so that i can go to sleep. You can laugh but I never said I was looking for some intellectual stimulation. &nbsp; I still go out on the weekend, to our usual watering hole - TSB. The thing is I've only realised that before this I would go out hoping to meet a guy, and feel good about myself. It was stupid of course because you only pick up drunk twats. Nowadays, I go out to chill, smile and I don't care who's watching (if anyone is) or whatever. I'm out just to relax and pretend that I don't have to go into the office on Monday and write. I just want to not write for a month.  &nbsp; Anyway, on one of my weekend outings, i stayed behind at TSB to hang out with my waiter friends when the cute bartender I've been flirting with came on to me. And because I haven't been with a guy for a while, I let him. He is only 22 and he looks like a samurai. He's quite clever and he's eager to please. He knows when I come in to TSB no matter where I sit because I'm the only one who orders Strawberry Long island Teas. He makes them extra strong especially for me and if I'm sitting downstairs, he'd deliver it to me himself and we'll have a short chat. Sigh. No, we're not having a relationship. That would be too weird. &nbsp; But last weekend I had a real blast. Zab declared, "Let's get wasted." I purchased a bottle of vodka. And the night began. We danced and danced and went to Finnegans and on to Waikiki. At Waikiki a mat salleh guy comes up to me and signals that he can't hear or speak - what the hell was he doing at a dance club? The answer was obvious:he was looking for booty. His name was Francko and he was from Italy. How did we communicate? Napkins courtesyof Waikiki. I didn't know how to tell him no. He kept telling me to follow him back to Concorde Hotel to eat... yeah right, eat. Farez came to my rescue. The only good thing about being picked up by a deaf mute is that you can say all kinds of thing in front of his face and he wouldn't know you're talking bad about him. I know, it sounds almost cruel. But as zab told me, a&nbsp;man is a man and a sleaze is a sleaze whether he has his full five senses or not. Wise, she is.  &nbsp; Anyway, apart from some weird nights out on the weekend, I've been working. You know what? Writing for a living isn't easy...we get writer's block at the worst possible time, and sometimes the interesting bit of a story is so deep that you have to keep digging and digging, but the PR people have only given you 30 minutes. The questions don't always come so easy. &nbsp; I'm not whinging. I'm not trying to make excuses for not contributing to the blog. It's my reason and I will try harder next time to contribute a little bit more. Maybe shorter musings but more frequently. Please forgive me. I love you all and miss hanging out with you. I can't wait until I see you all again. Love, love always..

						   Yesterday was one of the worse days of my life. Well at least since 2004 began. I wasn’t talking to Jason and one of my dearest friends has suddenly decided that I no longer was important enough to call or sms. I felt alone. And usually when that happens I seek refuge at my mom's. Just to mope and not have anyone question why all I wanted to do was sleep.   Still moping alone sometimes can make you feel even worse. And that's why I was glad that JacQ needed someone to accompany her to Bangsar. She needed to collect anecdotes for her magazine. Funnily enough, after my mom, Emelia, cousin and friends shared their stories, we had enough. But JacQ still wanted to go and I was more than happy to be distracted from my sorrows.  Felt weird to be in tsb on a Thursday. Although, it was kind of nice cause there were so many unknown faces. It was still festive but the pressure to 'have a good time' wasn’t there, which was great. JacQ bought me a strawberry long island tea - her signature drink. It was my first. A little sour, but strong. More importantly, it helped me relax.   But alcohol does that. You expect it. What I didn’t expect was: JacQ made me laugh. We’ve gone through so many rough moments that I always feel a little apprehensive whenever we go out. But yesterday was so real and so easy. Instead of worrying about making sure she's alright and that she's having a good time, she made me feel that way. And she didn’t even have to try. It just came so naturally.  In the end I know that, if I were to infact break one day, it wouldn’t be because Jason and I fought or because one of my friends just suddenly didn’t have time for me- but it would be because the ones that matter the most stopped caring. The loneliness then would kill my spirit- kill me.  Jacq, who came to my rescue yesterday: thank you for keeping me alive.

						   So I'm in Disneyland right, and I go watch the Aladdin show. The show is like every hour on the hour or something like that. It was a pretty funny performance considering it's targetted towards kids. Anyway, the woman playing Princess Jasmine was hot as hell, and in the show she and Aladdin kiss like at least 3 times. I sat there and couldn't help but think, "Man, that guy has got an awesome job!" I wouldn't mind getting paid to kiss a hottie 3 times an hour every damn day. How much you wanna bet there's a little tonsil hockey going on behind the stage as well??

						    urlLink    Demi - Sydney Zoo&nbsp; urlLink      I remember the exact time i was told Demi was born. I was at the Inter School Choral Speaking Competition in BBGS. I had a weird haircut. I was 16. We won 8th place.  Demi was born a furball. Hairy little thing. She was the sibling's secret. My parents only found out a week later.   And after 9 years, Demi is the sole thing that has kept my parents together and us stronger.   Demi I love you 2 ringgits!

						   I was sitting down at a Starbucks one day wondering why I didn't bring my powerbook and use the free Wi-Fi when I looked up and saw this huge ass in my face. There was this slightly "heavy" lady wearing these tight jeans with some writing on the right hand pocket. First rule in fashion: don't highlight your flaws. We all have them - some are just better at hiding them. &nbsp; Anyway, while I'm silently criticising her sartorial choices she sits down with her drink. An equally fleshy male (who had some hair issues - not so much on the head but plenty on the arms)&nbsp;comes up and gives her a kiss, and joins her. I watch them talking and laughing together for the whole time I was there. Yeah, I guess I was being a bit stalkerish. Then finally the Roly-poly couple got up and walked off hand in hand.  &nbsp; It didn't matter what I thought of her fashion sense or his style cut: they had each other and I have no one. It's weird. I grew up watching Beverly Hills 90210, Cluesless, and every horrible movie ever made inflicted on poor unsuspecting teenagers and think that your key to finding true love was having (1) good hair, (2) okay looks, (3) sense of style, (4) good taste in music, (5) a great group of friends, (6) the ability to change from nerd to cool by the end of an hour and a half...etc &nbsp; But I realise that I'd found love once and I can find it again - especially with someone on the same side of the planet at least. Someone who loves me for me because if wide-ass found her mate, I'm sure beer-belly (that's me!) can find someone. I mean, I'm sure there's something for everyone out there. Just got to keep an eye out for the best deal. Too bad men don't come on e-bay. &nbsp; love, love &nbsp;

						   went for a job interview today. press secretary. i wore my old suit, my best one. felt really weird. gotten so used to my jeans and t's.   frankly, i went because i love jacq's dad. and i think the money will help jason and i. plus my dad looks so proud every time he speaks to people about it. its a rare look. especially when its about me.  the interview was long. 1 1/2 hours. they asked me good questions. dumb ones, like "how will you adapt" and then just plain old dumb chat i.e "akademi fantasia". after that they talked about how uncle leo's "different" from the previous minister. couldn't determine what they meant by that. my guess, they miss the old ways.   they checked my portfolio and thought "hey, this girl can take photos, be an emcee - lets pimp her for everything then". so they told me how good it was that i can do all these things, incase whoever they would hire is unavailable, then yay - there's me. then i'm thinking, wait a minute, what is the post i'm being interviewed for again?   worse still, they sneaked in getting me to emcee their media night... for free! i pulled the stops there. this is bullshit. told them, i don't know if i will be free, although what i really wanted to say was.... "what? shouldn’t you be welcoming me into your office by showing me the ropes first? inviting me to your press nite as a GUEST first? not by pimping me to do all these things you would otherwise hire people to do." i was appalled.  firstly, i don’t work for you guys. second, you expect me to believe that uncle leo will decide based on my performance as an emcee if i would make a good press secretary - please la.   i left feeling so jaded. i was disappointed in them. they let me down.   but i'm still undecided about the job. we'll see.

						    after having a whinge at jacQ for disappearing from the blog i'm feeling a little guilty about my own lack of contribution.&nbsp; so it's saturday morning, 11am, still in my pj's, listening to george michael... &nbsp; ready to&nbsp;share... hah    &nbsp;   the past few months have been strange.&nbsp; i suspect i usually appear calm, self-assured, even distant perhaps to some, and not all of you know&nbsp;it's all to hold together a ball of chaos that ricochets &nbsp; through the entire spectrum of&nbsp;emotions and the behaviours they ensue.&nbsp; i tell you what was really strange for me...&nbsp; two years ago a boy i was in love with did something which totally devastated me.&nbsp; i sat in the gutter and sobbed.&nbsp; i rang laura the next day to tell her and she was surprised that i'd cried.&nbsp; i always previously thought i was easy to read, didn't hide anything.&nbsp; one of my closest friends is now telling me that she's surprised i reacted to something.&nbsp; so i asked my flatmate, who i'd lived with for four years what she thought.&nbsp; she said that she never knew what i was thinking, that i held everything in.&nbsp; i realised that the times when i lose it emotionally i'm always by myself and manage to seem like nothing's wrong to everyone else.&nbsp; so this is something i've tried to work on - to let people in, but trust is a big thing for me and takes a long time to earn.    &nbsp;  now&nbsp;i have one of my oldest friends not speaking to me at the moment because on her&nbsp;birthday the guy she had a massive crush on hit on&nbsp;me and i let him.&nbsp; for that moment,&nbsp;feeling close to someone was the over-riding factor.&nbsp; and so one pays the price for those purely selfish decisions.&nbsp; but i am so sick of putting people's needs before my own.&nbsp; i do it with&nbsp;family,&nbsp;friends, work and my huge&nbsp;capacity to feel guilt doesn't help.&nbsp; i hate appearing falliable and needy, detest&nbsp;failure, need a guarantee that something is going to work, need to know that people are going to like me.&nbsp;&nbsp;i have a huge list of regimented rules inside my head.&nbsp; my friends in sydney know that if i don't&nbsp;answer my phone for a few days i'm in "isolation booth mode" when i shut down because i can't deal with people any more.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  i&nbsp;know that i&nbsp;deliberately don't challenge myself.&nbsp; one of my friends told me that i was one of the smartest people he knows&nbsp;and that i can do anything i put my mind&nbsp;to.&nbsp; whilst not wanting to blow my own trumpet,&nbsp;i suspect it's probably true&nbsp;but doing anything about it&nbsp;incurs risk, and with risk comes uncertain outcomes.&nbsp; it's&nbsp;something to work on i guess - it must be boring having nothing wrong with&nbsp;oneself ;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    and so... writing this i realise this is just scratching the surface.&nbsp; back to all smiles and on with my day.&nbsp; like everyday.     &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

						   I have a new topic circling my nebula and its not about sex or  meat...this time its about coffee and culture.  maybe it has been my dreamy longing for sipping caffeine in the  humidity or perhaps my heighten senses that comes from living in the ephemeral states of live-life through verbs, adverbs pronouns and adjectives. Nouns, unfortunately are very scarce in my life. I am never one for yelling to a specific person or thing.   A cup of late evening tea.  its just this one paragraph that got me completely aflight. The process of making coffee in South India. from all the coffee contraptions i have ever come across all my life this seems like the most romantic notion of a part of a culture i would love to colonise in my own way. how i am bastardizing the form simply by using the word colonise is yet to be explained  The Coffee making process.  1.A steel pot is put on the fire to boil with equal amounts of milk and water that fills its pit.   Here if you are using fresh milk, you'd probably have to consider the fact that your milk man might have mixed in water with the milk before hand which i hear is common practice in india. I wonder if this happens in malaysia too? Believe it or not, we get fresh milk delivered to the house by a milkman. So i guess there is no way to tell so you'd just have to use your senses to judge i think if you have a good eye, or nose and maybe a hint of telepathy and psyhicness in you, you would be able to see if the milk has been diluted or not haha. speaking of milk , did you know pregnant women are always horny. and did you know through prolific suckling of a womans tit she could be induced to lactate. i read it somewhere.  think it was the village voice.   2. The characters in the book, then proceeds to have an utterly repressive conversation with each other while the milk and water is brewing on the fire.  the book is about some chick not having the balls to tell her parents that she is marrying a white dude in America. wow, indian brahmin's are quite the bunch. There is this thing with castes. even I being borne far from this aspect of reality, so much of it still exists in my everyday life. I can't tell you how many times i was reminded of where i come from. Esspecially, from a tearful mother who caught her daughter smoking cigarretes in public at the age of 19, prompting the..oh what would people say... do you know everyone knows your grandfather...etcetcetc. i don't think it would be to hard to tell her if i was marrying a white ,black, chinese etc etc etc at this point. considering i have taunted her with the idea of buying sperm and just having a kid, if i am not satisfied with my batch of proposals by the time i am 35. hahaha  think the scariest and most freaking 'caught in the act' episode was me sitting outside somewhere in the city centre having a coffee with the wife of the German Ambassador who was really off her rockers, along with Vincent. Then my phone rings and my mother promptly says. PUT DOWN THAT CIGARRETTE.. I so freaked out , cause at that moment, i was in fact casually sporting a cigarrette in my right hand stealthly moving from the ash tray to my lips. shit, that was so scary cause i couldn't see her, and i was in fact still living under her roof.  until this day, i don't know if she saw me from the car, or from her third eye. hahaha  3. steel cups, that are placed in snug little steel bowls are then filled with some instant coffee, a teaspoon worth. With some sugar, perhaps. And the frothy nearly burnt smelling milk is poured into each steel cup from the steel pan. You'd pour a little bit of coffee into each little steel bowl that came with your cup to cool it off while you sip it. This is a great idea, that way when you get to the final liquid left in the cup it would still be warm and not yucky cold, cause you spent 3 minutes blowing the top of the cup so that your tongue won't get burnt if you drank it in a hurry.  finally, i am inspired to write. i think i will be able to sleep  well  tonight. I hope this goes along way from just being a thought and a moment in time left to the vastnes of cyberspace. fivearts is having a interesting show. Go see it and tell me how krishan jit does with 'taking the NICE bus', while i try and get inspired by sin city once again. gosh , haha it seems that the last place you want to go is always the place you end up. So with as much gloss and glitter i can carry on my face, Vegas here i come, once again.  with much love harpreet.

						   jacq and i went to zouk last night to meet carol. it was great to see her and catch up on old times. cant beleive its been 10 years since the last time we met. the update : she's married to a gorgeous man, she lives in the netherlands and is fluent at dutch. needless to say everything has changed except for the way we look... or so i thought.  after a beer and a lot of water later, i needed to go to the loo and thank god so did jacq(i hate zouk and most definately hate wondering in there alone). so we made our way through all sorts of smells, ugly guys and scantily dressed chicks to the door marked with a big "W".   the ladies room was impressive. huge, white and very clean. after a much needed release, i made my way to the sink and washed my hands. usually i hate checking myself out in the mirror, don't know why. but this time, there was so many of us, so i didn't mind.   as i was checking my reflection, combing my fingers through my hair, i couldnt help but notice one very glaring difference between me and the other girls.....age, and i had the bigger numbers.  there was about 6 of us standing in a row, and i stuck out like a sore thumb. these werent girls, as jacq said later, they were babies. it made me feel old, and worn out.  as my eyes shifted back and forth between these fetuses and myself, jacq came out of the stall and stood next to me, and she noticed it too. but at least then, there was two of us.  not alone anymore, i could look more closely at these girls. and then i eavesdropped. and then i felt better. being young has its advantages. but when you're young, you're so insecure. yes, we are all still very insecure at times, but at least we care less about wanting to impress everyone. and we have a better sense of what's real and what matters more.  sure, i walked out of there feeling a little older, but I was happy. well, at least for that moment, and at that moment there was no reason to stop dancing.

						   EMERGENCY SEX AND OTHER DRASTIC MEASURES:  the book is coming to an end  this book has been like Alex garland's  Der Strand( the beach)   and Terzani's A fortune teller told me   type affect on me.  it is so good and so well placed in my life. my books are like boyfriends are to other women. so sad huh hahaha the only disease you could get due to quantity here though is intellectualism ..kekekeke but... now that its words  are being hastily  devoured by my eyes  with each turn of the page there is a sinking feeling a terrible terrible sinking lonely feeling that i may not find another that would entertain me as much as ESNODM has cause i can see the end coming.  the book isn't about sexual phantasies of the ordinary kind this book is about the ultimate sexual phantasy of my kind its about a doctor from new zealand a secretary from new york who used to work in the Bowery Shelter and a Lawyer from Harvard.  its about their experiences as UN peace workers actually trying to make a difference instead of just talking about it and dreaming it..like me. its set during the ages of Farah Aidid in Haiti post Khmer Rouge Cambodia Black Hawk down, Somalia Rwanda and Bosnia.  it has made me look at democrats with a different eye. Clinton is a fucking pussy. he needed to be Bush on the Somalia , Haiti and Somalia issue and well Clinton needed to be Bush on the Iraq ,NAfta, Kiyoto treaty issues. i won't bore you with the details if you are unlucky enough to be caught with me sometime soon, you'll hear all about it .  its about the politics taught in school and politics in the real world the ridiculousness of the UN and the insane logic of men. sigh the things that go on in this world sometimes....god there are no words to describe it la.  the sad thing is that in every war it is the women that suffer the most the rapes, the humiliation the things they would do to pregnant women etc god it is just so alien, even animals don't do these things in the wild. Man have de evolutionized in ways that make animals look more 'civilized' even in the Joseph Conrad type way.  i have heard of female circumcision in Somalia and other parts of Africa but what i didn't know was that they would sew them up!   there was this one part of the book where this pregnant woman had to be cut, cause she was sewn up  so she could give birth. so you would think she's pregnant right, how come she was still sewn up? well i guess its obvious they are sewn up after sex i guess. fucking hell man! i want someone to just nuke somalia la i am sorry i would rather be dead that be living in a culture like that.  ok now that i have grossed you out i will change the subject.  back to desperately seeking.. so now that i am 75% through the book this fear has set in and i have this huge anxiousness radiating from my being. i am desperately seeking something that would live up to this level of enlightenment eeick I am sorry that i am sounding so  superficial about the whole thing la  so what have i done. live every desperate person i looked online. i didn't get pol pot's autobiography cause, well, i am still rather timid about reading cambodian history at this moment, not until my mum comes to stay or JW gets her ass here. that way i won't wallow it in my soul alone. i had nightmares reading rwanda accounts as it is and somalia mutilations.  PEACE: i had the nicest nap today. it was for an hour cause ritu wanted to go out and have coffee and cake but it was so good. a power nap. you'd never think about how lucky you are when you are sitting at a cafe with you illy cafe waering a barely covering your ass skirt in your bikini facing the ocean with you vagina intact till you read about somalian women.  superficially greatful, self obsessed me me.

						   Losing my pants, Once again:  Vegas, does get better. I quite enjoy it now actually. This time I lost my pants in Jimmy Choo's and i won change on the slots so, IT IS ALL GOOD :)  the shoes...ahh the shoes I love shoes. They are black , about 4 inches Stilleto's of course. with stars on the sole's nothing like a pair of nice black heels right with soles of stars.   This trip confirmed a few things for me. one, that i am not really not so unlucky when it comes to gambling two, that I have the coolest brother on earth.  three, you can't fucking ever sleep in vegas. I am so tired still. Fourthly,  if i had a gun, I think ritu would have loaded it for me to shot Amit. Ew oh god he irritated me sooo much! he was the type that switched accents according to the race that surrounded him in extreme ways. arrghh i don't think anyone has ever irritated me more, think he got the picture, turns out that i can be a real bitch hahaha. and finally, yes, i am a major fucking flirt when i want to be. so terrible la ,me , i got two friend sqaubling slightly  for something neither one was going to get anything out of. so there was justin,  some guy that looks like the skinny version of John Cusack kekeke Justin, he was a cutie, looked 18 but was 28. Asian of course...caucasian mixed i reckon. We partied at Rain till 4 am. and wait...i really think that bathrooms are sexy places. i liked the bathrooms at the Venetian. granted they didn't look so sexy when i was there with my parents, but what does when your parents are around eh.  ELECTRICITY: so we were supposed to stay at the West In but when we got there, there was no electricity which was strange cause ALL THE SLOT MACHINES WERE WORKING hahaha it turned out that if the elect works didin't come on by 10 pm  they would have had to haul our asses out so we ended up at the Venetian.  SAPPHIRES: We went to a strip club the next day, which was so much fun. there were 5.5 of us. 4 girls, groovy and amit arrgghh .  my brother wanted to buy me a lap dance but unfortunately the other girls were getting bored by then and i passed it out as a gracious party goer and i didnt want to look GAY hahaha so i just climbed into the limo quite satisfied la. I wanted one, but i guess i have to be honest i had a few reservations. them being -that the girls maybe kinda cootie covered cause of all the guys they had previously 'danced' for the other was..and ...well i mean COME ON haha my brother was buying me a lap dance! haha it just seemed abit ...haha weird i guess..haha  so it was then and there that i decided that if i had son's, they are so going to spend their 21st birthday in vegas with their uncle groovy. and if i have girls, well they will spend their 21st birthday in vegas with uncle groovy and if they don't mind, their mother ( me) may want to come along haha.. but i think they wouldn't like it to much if i was there haha so i'd probably just settle with hiring one for a private party for me and my sperm donater haha.  Sapphired out: The strip club was really quite cool. it was basically just topless, haha thank god actually one step at a time ! and there were some girls that were just out of this world my favourite one had to be this one white girl huge tits of course, pierced nipples, slightly chubby, wait wait my favourite part is yet to come she rocked glasses! and slapped her ass a couple of times haha so it turns out glasses and all that fucking hot in my books. it was her smile too la, she had a giggley girly snickering type thing going like a good girl being naugthy and could believe it. hhmm am i projecting hahaha she just looked ridiculously sexy nerdy yet punked out and all. so there were these indian guys there who actually became too distracted by 4 girls 2 of whom were indian, hollering and clapping at the strippers. they were totally scandelized. I think the consensus was that this was definately a place to bring a boyfriend for a night out and buy each other lap dances.  so i guess you are wondering like most other virgin strip club goers or male counter parts why wouldn't a bunch of girls go see male strippers? are they gay?  so , this is basically what i think. guy strippers are gross. penises are ugly, the only reason we like them is because we like a 'particular' guy. haha, its umm personal i guess that makes them danglers cute???!! In general, nude women are far more pleasant to look at and they are just sexier la. naked guys are just boring. I can't tell you how many times i have been to clubs in NYC where there are only male go go dancers! BORING. ew...they are just lame. but i guess the horny old gay men enjoy la.  this trip was so nice la it oddly, brought the family closer. and when i say family, i really just mean groovy and I.  my uncle from india who lives here , came as well with his daughter in law who is a year older then me. What can i say, i wanted to shot him too at one point. Indian men , esspecially from india are 2 faced, hypocrites and fucking male chavaunistics. fucking dick mans. and i was kinda glad i wasn't married haha talking to somewhat repressed traditional indian girls can really turn you off dudes!! haha all my fears of thinking i am sort of conservative has gone out the window  and given me more skin to live in happily.  if there is one thing i hate it is a man who doesn't pick up after himself because he thinks the woman should do it. I remember that everytime i thought i was in that position, i  merely left my own plate on the table . actually , it has become a terrible habit now haha my brother has to clean up after me quite often haha but he is also one of the only men i ever cook for etc. and all the others, well i do it cause i want to. its a choice.  from all my sporadic moments of bickering cause i have never been in a relationship watching ritu, out  and bored made me rejoice with the fact that not only am i single but i am not from a weird ass conservative family that treats their girls like property they have to get rid of.  why is it that i am such a pliable creature when it comes to ideals?? haha now i seem to think it is almost completely necessary to sort of live with the person you might want to marry, cause fuck man, you really can't tell who they are till you hear them talk in their sleep hahaha. up until , what 3 weeks ago, i thought so differently, but i don't know, living with someone for more then 2 years and not even getting engaged basically means that you really should start seeing other people personally , for me . so if my ideals have changed, they have changed minutely la but drastically as well.  on a different note. umm jasmin i know what you are saying. i can relate to some of your experiences though sometimes i was on the other end  but in general i understand. i have learnt that at the end of the day if you like someone and you aren't doing shit about it its your loss and you really can't expect people to back off from the opportunity. personally, i would back off la, but it all depends. it depends on the guy you know and if they guy likes someone else and not me or her then its just a blessing in disguise that we sometimes don't see at a given moment. just listen to MOnica: don't take it personal.  i got a fortune cookie today. and i actually think my fortune is coming. haha that or my period la.  :)  love, me

						   When I was a young and depressed teenage who rarely smiled, I used to picture another me. One who had friends. One who smiled alot. One who had a fun job that some (not all - i know, they've got better jobs - sigh) would envy. One who would have people think about her once in a while and call her when they do. One who would get invited to things not because the other party's parents forced them into. One who would...shit, I could go on.  I think I've sort of become her - the other me. But I'm not sure if I like her... yet.  There was another teenager that I knew way back when who was more down in the dumps than I could ever be. I don't what she did, but the last time I saw her she laughed and smiled along with me. She would even take a compliment without making three insulting comments about herself to cancel the good one.  Sometime last week she emailed me photos of her party trip to Vegas. There was a beautiful girl there who looked like she enjoyed life, and some that it had to offer her. She looked like that other me I pictured when I was younger except that she didn't have my face. She had the face of a friend of mine I call Harps.  I didn't think it could be her because the teenager that I knew loved to slouch and looked as if everything she looked at, from a rainbow to a rat in Bangsar, depressed her. This girl was standing a little straighter and looked very confident.  Harps is a wonderful writer - slightly scattered at times, and an amazing artist. I am not in the know of anything to do with art nor am I a big fan of it. I am however a big fan of beautiful paintings that sometimes speak to me. And one of her paintings did.  At that same time, she and I were working out unresolved issues. In my silent apology for any hurt I caused her, I wrote an article about her (it was fun interview done on our backs in her bedroom) accompanied by a picture featuring the painting that spoke to me. A girl sitting on the floor in a corner of a tiled room...alone. Like the old me, thinking that the world offered nothing that suited me. Like the old her, that knew that sometimes the world couldn't give her what she needed.  Today she's stepped out into her own. Maybe a little dazed and confused by the Californian sun but she's a member of life as she wants it to be - save for getting a job maybe? Anyway, I hope she realizes just how beautiful she is when she's happy, and how it gladdens us to see her in that state - of bliss or California - because it really works.

						   no. especially to a dear friend's father, whom i love to death.  after thinking about it for about 3 weeks now, i finally had to tell jacq's dad that i won't be taking the job. infact i've been avoiding talking to him (cause i don't want to disappoint him) for about 2 weeks now and finally today, in the morning, he messaged me to call him.  i procrastinated and only just called him during lunch hour. i told him that although i think its a great opportunity and the salary is good, i love my job. and i've only been here 10 months. there's still so much for me to learn, do and enjoy.  uncle leo is so sweet. he said that although he knows i would be perfect for the job and that he would benefit more than i would from me working with, he doesnt want to hold me back from exploring my true potential in the field that i love. he thinks that i will make it big one day.  don't know how much truth there is to that la. especially since i'm still a PA after 10 months. but, hell, he beleives in me. and for today, that'll do.  jacq - you're so lucky.

						    it's a sunny sunday in sydney.   i'm still in my pyjamas, the tops and bottoms of which don't match and the t-shirt i wore yesterday.   i haven't been grocery shopping this week so i had cold soba noodles for breakfast.      yesterday was a bit of a loss, experiencing the after-effects of having too much fun on friday night.    i didn't really move from the couch - i am amazed at how much rubbish tv one can watch in a day.   consider the fact that i don't have cable - so at 1am today i was flicking between a tv movie starring judd nelson and one with tracey gold (from growing pains) called "face of evil."   i finally hauled myself into bed when i started watching infomercials about DIY dermabrasian.   friday night was my friend zoe's birthday party.   she is a new friend although when we first met this year we realised that we had done pilates together for a year but never spoke.   i think that says something about the self-absorbed people that we are turning into these days.   i met a boy called nick at her party.   we had a spirited discussion about harry potter (he likes, i don't) and michael moore (we both like).   he said that he liked my arms.   he does personal training and has muscles and a shaved head - not the usual MO for me, but which one of those has ever turned out?   so he says he is going to call me and today i choose to be optimistic!      by the by, i'm sure you are all finding this absolutely riveting (insert sarcasm here).      i'm having an interesting time at work - not the actual work itself but more observing my work-mates.   having lived in middle-class suburbia all my life and being my father's daughter, i suppose i've always been quite ambitious when thinking about what i plan to do with my life.   not necessarily translating it into dollar terms but to always be challenged, try new things and push boundaries.   therefore meeting people who are happy to do the same job for years, pay off their mortgage on a house out in the sticks and have their 2.2 children confounds me.   i know this might sound very judgemental and high-minded but i struggle with the idea of not wanting more and not just in regards to money - more about experience.   maybe in a sense i am envious of their contentment.   but i cannot comprehend not wanting to do more with your life, to see new things, to see if your crazy idea might work.  to leave your potential untapped.   choosing to settle with what you've got seems to me to be the biggest injustice we can do ourselves.      i think i'll be in kl for the last two weeks in december.  keep your fingers crossed for me that i can get time off work.
