      I have a giant scab on my face! and why? because I am stupid, because I always pick my face, but I had promised myself not to pick before the wedding, but no, my hands took over my body and here I am - Scarface.... woe be me... and not just anywhere, but right on my left cheek, like a big fat beetle stuck there waving its little legs...   eating is fun, we should do it together some time.

Such is life. Fro, why did you get your brows done? You did NOT have a unibrow. You had two brows, I distinctly remember. As for me, I have to get over this coughing cold. I don't want spastic coughing as I walk down the aisle...although, that would be amusing (muHAHAHKEKEKEKEKcough). Fro, I love the name of this Blog page...

       O nce upon a time, there were 4 little gnomies. One of them wanted to be a mermaid and marry Legolas when it grew up, another wanted to sleep with its eyes closed, the third wanted to write fantastic stories about Jewish people - gnomie stories that is, and the fourth just wanted to stop eating potatoes and leaving Chex Mix in its mist - this last one was quite addicted to them you see.   So these 4 little gnomie friends grew up, the first never became a mermaid, but found itself, to its satisfaction, a gnomie prince. The second was never able to sleep with its eyes closed, but has patented this as its very own defense mechanism to sell on telly. The third now writes fantastically intelligent stories on things most people don't understand, and the fourth is still eating potatoes and Chex Mix - it cannot help itself you see...   And I am glad to say, they will live  happily ever after .

         argh, it does no good to bring lunch.  On the days I try to save some money and pack something I end up eating it all by 10:00 and then by noon i'm hungry again!  I could try bringing two lunches but that's just scary, and how much worse would it be if i ate both and then bought some more still anyway?   ={}      / Yo Ro, Yom Kippur Monday!?  ah, the benefits of being among jews..!  especially this time of year. aren't there a whole slew of jewish holidays coming up? / by the way i thought the shout outs would mean getting msgs from others.  sadly us bloggers are just shouting out to each other..  :(

      Have you ever felt painfully underdressed? I say painfully because you're acutely aware to the point where you're cringing over the fact that everyone and their grandfather is wearing a suit, and you're wearing capris and flip-flops. I forgot that we had a policy event today, and I really really wanted to hear the speaker, but I didn't dress properly and so I can't go in...nor can I eat the food right now. I'm just going to have to wait it out. I really should bring another set of clothes to keep here for emergencies such as this. At least it's FRIDAY!!! We have Yom Kippur Monday off too :)

      wow - lots of new features here while i've been away for one day :) ron, i hope you're feeling better soon. get lots and lots of sleep. and you with glasses? but you have perfect vision!! oh no.. you'll become like me all scrunched up in front of the computer monitor trying to make out what it says on the small screen... let's see. it seems like this week went by much faster than last week which seems strange given that last week included the no-work-monday deal. but needless to say, i'm thankful tomorrow's friday.. very very happy.   i got in touch with bow! or actually, God lead me to get in touch with bow. i'm so happy. so thankful. for a while, i thought i'd chased her away b/c of just really being honest to her about the gospel. and then i became all doubtful whether i'd done right or wrong until i realized that this is really who i am and that i had to stop being so apologetic about my faith. i'm just thankful that God's leading me through a time of learning how to be desperate more than i could have imagined.   good night girls. i love y'all.

      Hiee, I'm back from the dead. With a little help from my friends (Cindy and Nyquil). I was having headyikes all morning and couldn't even go to work. Yes, I'm 23 years old and my body is falling apart. No need for mysteries, I must admit that I am still sick. I was in denial, thinking that I might even need glasses...BUT NO, it's never that dramatic for me. I'm just plain old sick. Did you miss my two cents today?  Fro, my sis had the funniest story about AfroKen a few months ago. She was visiting our fave Nihon hangout, Mitsuwa shopping center in Edgewater NJ, and a picture of AfroKen was hanging on a store window. An African-American guy passed, took one look at the dog with rainbow fro, and started flipping out. He was like, "WHAT?! Lookatthatdogwiththefro" and I suppose he was doing a whole neck spasm thing. It's not PC, but I had to laugh when my sis told me. I mean, the character is made by Japanese people with way too much time on their hands and it's not even supposed to make sense, let alone offend people. Ah well.

      Blogging 101:   To create a link   First, write your blog.  e.g. Who Do wants to show y'all this cool site.  Then highlight the words you would like people to click on to see the link: e.g. Who Do wants to show y'all   this cool site  .  Then look to the top right hand corner of the box where you are typing, there are 5 icons: 1. a globe and a chain 2.  B  3.  I  4. A thumbtack w/ the word Post 5. 2 computers w/ the words Post & Publish Click on the 1st icon - the globe and chain (linking to the world wide web, get it?)  Type in desired URL, then voila: e.g. Who Do wants to show y'all  urlLink this cool site   hint: remember not to double the http:// ... I do that sometimes...

      I have to share something funny that made me laugh OUT LOUD in my cubicle.  I'm sure it'll lose much of its funniness on telling it but -- One of my senior coworkers this morning sent me all the emails in his inbox related to one of his old projects which I'm taking over.  The last one of the batch was from February, on the day i started working here -- from my supervisor to him.  I click it open and it says: "Please get the new engineer, Ms. Dennis Koh involved in this project."   I couldn't believe my eyes...  urlLink THAT NAME  follows me Everywhere.  I dunno, it was just very unexpected.   I'll have a bone to pick with my supervisor later..

      WHAT a day. i was dizzy all morning and my coworkers helped convince me that i needed an eye checkup. so i had to do all this research looking for an eye doctor, only to realize that our normal health care provider doesn't provide vision coverage. so i'm looking for a new doctor with our actual eye care provider, only they're not MDs they're ODs, which isn't the same. and as i was doing that i tried to scarf down lunch and was blowing my nose (as usual since i've had this cold), and then my nose started bleeding...arggg. i'm thirsty. mr. sandman, give me a drink. and what's this SHOUT OUT function. isn't that just blogging?   my tribute to 9/11 is not to let it stop me from going about my daily life.

      ok, the new SHOUT OUT function is for commenting, so don't go writing on each other's blogs, just  shout out  ok?  p.s. I don't know how I am supposed to feel today... sad, reflective, looking toward the future? This reminds me of the 6/4 tragedy in Tien An Men Square in Beijing, when I was too young to really understand it all. Plastered all over the newspapers were pictures of people being ran over by tanks. I will be afraid to turn on the TV tonight, there will be episode upon episode on 911, the planes, the smoke...  I know I will be resented when I say this, but I have never come to love America, it has never treated me well as a foreigner. But this is a cry out from humanity as a whole I feel, and as part of this broken-down generation, I have a sense of the hurting.   God, let us turn to you always, in our hope, in our despair. I do not understand, but you do, and that is enough for me.

      aw, fro, fro, you're too much!  :D I'm glad - for public health reasons and all - for your definition of this poignantly poignant disease. well done, well done. we shall nominate you for a Nobel. or Somethin.

      why do bookcovers always use words like poignant - it means so much and so little at the same time.  poignancy makes me indignant.    Fooliosis  n.   1. An acute contagious neurological infection characterized by enlargement of pupils, severe lack of common sense and loss of muscular control. It attacks the central nervous system and is transmitted by the bite of infected animals.  2. Any of various  infections of domestic animals characterized generally by idiocy and deficiency in judgement.  3. Illness is known to mutate through each contagion, adapting to host body and is hence refered by name specific to strain: e.g. Fiorenze - Fooliosis -> Denisia - Fooliosis -> Veronicias - Fooliosis (it is formal practice to have host name followed by hyphen and the medical term of illness - "Fooliosis")

      it's very green in here. i'm thinking of fiber and what it does to your system (iwl). thanks for the new look do. and flo, you can't settle into your cubby hole with your animals. you just can't. there's not enough space back there. well, maybe for one hobbit, but you're a human. don't you see the logic here?! i know, she's mrs. j now. i know (pat pat with my little hands). smells like cabbage. sometimes i wish i had something substantial to say...but then entering this page is like entering the twilight zone. you just go beserk.

      hallo gals! back to work it is tomorrow morning. bright and early.. can't believe the weekend is over already. those were some YUMMY panera sandwiches this afternoon, ya? :) i always feel like i have a lot to say, and then i come on here, then laugh at what you guys wrote, and then forget what i was going to say. my cheekbones(well, sort of non-existent cheekbones) are hurting so much b/c of constant smiling on saturday. i'm smiling in my sleep now. that's a good thing, right? :)   ronster - is your work email working okay now?  dennis - i might be going to the harbor tomorrow during lunch break to run errands. if you're up for it, lemme know! :D  florence - you're still sleeping away as i type this.. good night missy.   btw, i changed the template layout. isn't this one cuter? no? aiight.. you gals can change it back if this one seems to "fruity."

      hey, what just happened (didn't post!)? ANYWAY, I would like to say that this hobbit definitely feels like she's out of the shire. why are there nerds and dictionaries running rampant in this room? and I want a pet peach too! not to keep, but to eat.  i'm going home today on a greyhound bus. the kind that gives you motion sickness just thinking about riding it. round trip is the equivalent of one way on amtrak. you do the math (i mean, whodo the math). but i need to go home this weekend, and i will let you know how everything went on monday.  my parting words: fro: umm, put down the dictionary. speakie englishie de: you're not a nerd. you're a geek :) do: use your diplomatic powers, chinese, and pet peaches. give 'em everything you got!  love you crazy girls

      ok,  fine , under the severe protestations of one de whodo? I am changing the funny links. I remain uninspired, and bereaved by accusations of being mean-spirited (*muhahaha... ahemmm....) so I take this responsibility out of my hands.   *now that ms. pocket protector has learnt the trade of not working and messing with blogspace during work hours, I hereby resign my Queen-ship - actually it kinda has been annulled, since there is no dictatorship anymore... man!!...  it was fun while it lasted. *  Please give me suggestions as to what links to give to each person. Public opinion is welcome, please shout as you please. (kosher, un-derogatory ones please)  ew... my grapes taste like the smell of the zip-lock bag... oh well.  did you know do keeps pet peaches in her car?  * this has been the most random and insane (no longer in a cute/ funny insane way) blog ever. I think I shall refrain from blogging for a while...

      just wanted to get one blog in before i left for work. man, i feel like i'm missing out on all the action during 9-5 so i shall make up for it beyond those hours ;)    tomorrow, i'm heading up to new york for the day to meet g's parents. automatic first response was, "i really really really hope they at least don't hate me at first sight."  automatic g's response was "they already love you w/o having met you."  so the jitters are gone and anxiety level has dropped down to a normal level. blessed that i'm able to go and and bless them along with him :)

That was kind of freaky, tracing my lineage and all. Second "what the": WHEN DID GUYS infiltrate our page? Frodowhodo, I think we need to pow-wow.

      everything is busy-ness, hectic, hectic... everything seems to be piling on top of each other, and there is no place to breathe. graduation -> jobs -> health plans -> buying cars ->  engagements -> buying homes -> weddings -> mortgage ->  retirement funds -> financial portfolios -> children -> college funds...  and we want to stick planting churches somewhere in the flow of things... ok, I'm just at stage 3 going on stage 4, but still, most of these words were not in my brain a year and a half ago...

      i had oysters and clams late last night. haven't had them in a long time and i think it did something funky too my stomach. i felt like there was a dance session going on inside the entire day today.   i've been thinking, we should all take a day trip somewhere.  when  being the question yeah? with the kindred spirit conf, nt wright conference, jeff searles worship(whoo-hoo!), and much more, i guess all of our weekends are pretty much booked. and since i can't use any of my vacation days till who knows when (ah, the joy of working in the private sector), weekdays are a no-no. okay. i guess it's just my wishful thinking of the day.   dennis - hey, there's no class on friday at the gym except for aqua aerobics. did you want to come another day instead?

      Aww, I missed you guys. We had off from work yesterday for Yom Kippur (Gentiles included, that's me! Guess what age I am!). I saw the Jewrean link for me and I'm so touched. Soooo...I must share about the insane dream I had last night. It was the day of Jane and Steve's wedding, and the bridesmaids were all there, but the setting was different. I think we were in a hotel because we (the maidens) had our own staff of maids and butlers. They were serving us hand and foot (is that the right expression?). ANYWAY, even when we had to get dressed and prepare, they were there to help us. The wedding was still set for 3pm, but by 4, I still wasn't ready. I hadn't even taken a shower. Panic-stricken, I asked Do, "Am I late? Doesn't the wedding start at 3?" And Do was already dressed and had her makeup on, and she tried to assure me by saying, "We're on time," but I looked down at my watch and it was past 4, and I thought, "uhhh, what is she talking about?" BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? By that point, yes in the middle of my dream, I said to myself, "This is not real Ron. Wake up, your alarm clock's going off. Go to work." I just thought it was strange because on the actual wedding day, I had hours of free time with nothing to do but entertain Jane. Frodowhodo, I welcome your comments.

       ~ News Flash ~    Nation   - Another Engagement! -  'Guess what is new?' do asked fro last night, 'yet another engaged couple.' An increasing trend of matrimony has been reported lately in the Agape churches.  This time, our happy couple is from ALC. Congrats y'all !!   Local   - Sighting of Alien Driving Vehicle -  Residents of Charm City have sighted a strange foreign creature driving a silver Mazda Protege early last afternoon. Also reported that victim in passenger seat appeared calm, oblivious of her ominous fate. According to reliable sources, one "fro blob", (resident alien) was responsible for the chaos commencing from Center Street to Cross Keys. The suspect vehicle was also seen attempting to enter W******* A***, repeatingly backing up and driving forward while the gate threatened to close onto the hood of the automobile.   Entertainment   - Becket on Film -  A collection of world acclaimed poet, writer, playwright and Nobel prize winner Samuel Beckett's works was shown on  MPT  last night. Part of the  Stage on Screen  series,  urlLink Beckett on Film  was a sensational amalgamation of Beckett's immortal words and film magic. Bravo.

      Ro- this is for you:  Fact or Fiction? Antoine de Chezy (1718-1798)  French hydraulic engineer and author of a basic formula for calculating the velocity of a fluid stream Chezy formula was developed in 1775; it relates channel velocity to roughness, hydraulic radius, and channel slope.  (From Encyclopedia Britannica)  hehe, it's true.  Not that i particularly wanted to bring  that  horrid nickname up again but i ran into it again at work.. It's kinda related to my job, uncanny eh?   perhaps i shall call myself Shana de la Chez.  Sophisticated, non?  I can be ghetto french.

      last night's misadventure: i take nyquil and then watch "a walk to remember" with cindy, resulting in both of us laughing at the sheer idiocy of the movie. it had its moments, mandy can sing, shane can smirk, but by the end, cindy and i were consoling each other (i.e. "WHY oh WHY did we spend the night watching that?!). i was so...discombobulated that i actually passed the insanity test. i took it right after the movie and i didn't laugh. you know me, i laugh at almost everything. i'm sane, shane and mandy, thanks to you.

I haven't seen it yet, I don't want to keep catching parts of it!!! bad do do, bad!!!  and good morning, more coffee anyone?  p.s. ms. bom, am I really that strange?

      It's Friday, it's drizzling, and the IMF protests are happening a few blocks away from work. Our building is formally shut down for the day. Junior staff had to come into work to prepare for a semiannual conference we're having next week. There aren't many cars as driving was discouraged today. But most people are still walking to work, like me, merely glancing at the protestors with green signs, long hair, and bandanas -- 20,000 of them.  Let me pose a question: does the fact that you're protesting the corruption of portions of international society nullify the fact that you're disrupting a significant portion of American society? A portion that has nothing to DO with the corruption that you're protesting, and even has the potential to HELP you?

      ok First of all, the "category of the day" has BEEN Nerdiness for the WHOLE WEEK.  Between joke links, accusations, and confessions (a whole LOT from our anonymous shout outers!), that dead horse has been beaten to a PULP.  Could i possibly request that the N word be banned for a very very VERY long time?  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.  Seriously. (The related G word i think is dead but not quite pulp-like;  on the other hand there is plenty of life left in Freakishness and other such topics.)  Hmm.  I love the fall because *of the air, definitely.  Not humid and gross and not so dry that your hair gets all static-y.  And i know exactly what you mean, R, about the driving experience  :D  ..makes you want to go for walks too. *apple cider (hot or cold)  yummm.   *the leaves of course, but only when you're not the one that has to rake them up...  Aside from that, i don't know if fall's really my favorite season.   And is it just me or does being out of school kind of make all the seasons blur together..?  There isn't that whole excitement (and/or dread) of going back to school, with new supplies and teachers and classes...    sad sad.

      sudden flashback:  when I was little, I had these plastic little pigs that had magnets in them which made them stick their faces into each other's butts. I used to love them to death, I had the whole collection of pastel pink, blue and green ones.  my nanny got them for me with the little money she had; they were the gift with purchase of Darlie toothpaste. I love my nan. I wonder if they are still lying around somewhere in the house, or if my mom threw them away.   Speaking of  urlLink Darlie toothpaste , again another strange asian phenomenon.

      i had another jane&steve wedding dream. I KNOW! but let me tell the story first. so they had to have the wedding ceremony again for some reason, and this time it was in the caribbean. it was in one of those rustic churches (white paint slightly chipping off, small with pews) with the windows and doors open, letting the cool caribbean breeze come in. really pretty. and NONE of us had to get our hair done, we just all had it down... you can analyze this, but i've already decided that i was sufficiently traumatized with the whole studio stupid episode, enough so that it is haunting me in my dreams to this day. that or the moon cake i ate last night was really bad?  ooo, ooo! i love the fall because...  *of the riot of orange, red, yellow, and brown color *it changes your driving experience (windows down please!) *of that crisp wind, that smell of smoke from the leaves burning (well, in the ny/nj area) *you can still wear open-toed, but now you can wear your favorite sweater too *i remember childhood  *it is transient. that's what makes me appreciate it

      fro: G.O.D? that's also a Korean singing group, one of the ONLY ones that i actually like.  de: here is your fortune cookie reading for today --> don't be too ambitious (or insane). stick with "whodo" and lose "woohoo" unless you also want to add "eeehee."  do: here here about watching TV while you work out. i say HERE HERE.  oh my, our new RAs and interns crack me up. two of the guys take longer to get ready in the mornings than most of the girls. one of them wears a headband and has been nicknamed "flash" or "flashdancer." today he was also called "jigolo." why does that word look weird typed out? WHO ARE YOU?  oh, did you know that chris has a link to this page under "gnome weblog"?! i'm not even going to ask why he chose the word "gnome" (as i see my reflection off the computer screen).   i suppose it's high-time i put a link up. here you go...oh wait, i have to learn how to do that :)

      quick explanation of "Living Well in HK" the site is www.god.com.hk -- it is not pronounced "god" in one word, but rather "G.O.D" in letters ok? in fobbish, when you say "G.O.D" w/ a Cantonese accent, it sounds like you are saying "Living Better" in Cantonese. You know, Chinglish.  they have cool, hip furniture, pseudo Scandinavian stuff.

R- oh, rondo, you've not been the same since you left for nj.  don't be dazed and confused.  When in doubt, just keep on blogging..  I move to have my name changed from "WhoDo?" to "WooHoo!".  It doesn't change the feel of the site does it ?  RoFroDoWooHoo.

      i was watching the news today while on the treadmill (the only way that running on it goes a little faster), and there's so much craziness out there that i didn't even realize.  1. mother beating child in parking lot 2. we all need go get small pox vaccinations(!?) 3. what in the world is happening with bush's administration against iraq? 4. the INS is going to start fingerprinting saudi men  sad sad world we live in.   on the other hand, that is when i go and look at   urlLink this   and crack myself up.   :D

      explanations for Rondo's benefit: * we had production team on saturday to put together new Dive In packets, and by the way, I have to say they are looking wicked good.  * most of the insanity stemmed from that: -- BACON --> our unofficial name for production team (don't ask, it was Comf and howon) -- is it a prosthetic arm? --> fro's version of 20 questions... kinda w/ a twist of fro, you know, insane like... -- jungle christian music --> some techno song that has become Bacon's theme song. * "hoo-whatever" --> fro's retaliation of always being the butt of amusement between a. & w.  * most everything else, well, you have as much of an idea of what is going on as everyone else dearie...

      When I was at home this past weekend, Monica was like, "What do your friends call you again? Bobbit something?" I was shocked, simply shocked, and said, "RONDO. Rondo BAGGINS." Is this not something everyone should know?!  On another note, I feel...lost, disconnected. I don't know what you all talk about anymore.

They paint those, I wonder if they will let me play with them ??

      i just got back from doing maybe the scariest thing i've ever done.  This one job i'm on is in construction and part of it's a 60-foot-tall tank with steps winding around it on the outside.  You know those ugly industrial tanks you see when you're on 695 East, it's like one of those but skinnier and not painted yet.   After our meeting we walked up those steps.   They were JUST put in a couple weeks ago mind you, by some of the guys i've seen working there.  The steps are just grating so you can see EVERYTHING below you as you're walking further and further up (and away from safety).  Not to mention that every step of the guy going up in front of me was making the whole stairway jiggle.    The view from the top was great though. (Fro, i wished i could have taken a picture dude, i had my hard hat on too)

      Assignment #2   Things I Miss Most From My Childhood  1. buying noodles for breakfast from the old man who peddles around my part of town on his black and silver bicycle and giant silver bucket on it every Saturday morning. 2. running around the house in my underwear and red cape pretending to be superman. 3. sitting in front of the rotary fan and making strange noises. 4. jumping on my bed and singing until I fall dead asleep. 5. having someone wake me, put my uniform on for me, and have breakfast ready to go to school. 6. holding my baby brother. 7. getting toys for Christmas, getting toys for birthdays, getting toys. 8. my fisher price pirate's ship complete with peg-legged pirate + treasure; my plastic smurf house. 9. collecting everything: erasers, magnets, stamps, coins, pencils, stickers, notebooks... 10. sitting on the steps looking at the garden, eating sour green apples with a sprinkle of salt with my nanny.  11. getting chocolate bunnies for easter with the awful plastic green grass, little sugary eggs and fuzzy pipe cleaner chicks. 12. playing tag on the playground at school, monkeybars, forts, slides, seesaws, swings, break time (or what Americans call recess). 13. starting new school notebooks, getting new books for school and watching my mom wrap them in pretty plastic sheets for me.

       Assignment #2: Things I Miss Most From Childhood     1.  PLAYGROUNDS.  I dont know bout where yall grew up, but for me, Ive played on some Playgrounds  worthy of the name ..!   There used to be this  huge  wooden Castle one near my grandmas with all kinds of hiding spots, an absolute MAZE inside.  Towers with monkey bars and bridges connecting them, and slides leading down from them.  And lookout points.  And tire swings! Man, the memories... And somewhere in a N. Virginia park there used to be these slides: one Enormously Tall metal one (very scary for a six-year-old), another tall metal one (still like 10 feet high), and some very long twisty tunnel slides  The Castle playground and those great slides have since been torn down.  Now with lawsuits running rampant parks and schools are only putting up those awful, short fat plastic playgrounds (graffitti-proof and non-biodegrable).  No slides that go up past your shoulders, and a lot of places dont even want swings.  SAD SAD trend were seeing, I say: Better and better video games, dinkier and dinkier playgrounds.   >:(

      may i remind you that this is ro-fro-do-whodo, not geek-freak-nerd-smellslikecurd. and i've started my "things i miss most about childhood" essay on my homepage.   one of my coworkers learned a bit of korean while he was studying in israel, and he always says, "juk in da" (among other bits from the mother tongue). you know how it can mean both "that's so cool" or "i'm gonna kill you" depending on how you pronounce it, so the first time he yelled it in my face i was a bit alarmed. funny, SILLY jewish boy. so i was telling another coworker about when i think my jewreaness started, and i think it was a lot earlier than i suspected. growing up i loved reading this series called "all in the family" about an immigrant family in america circa early 1900s. i loved it, wanted to be part of the family, wanted to eat everything they ate...and they were jewish. our middle school librarian was also jewish, and every year she would make us potato pancakes. she actually brought a little propane cooker and fried them in the library for us! mmm...also, during college i would frequent the kosher section of the cafeteria just for the heck of it.  i had a yummy kosher donut today as well, made with vegetable oil instead of lard. the senior fellow who gave it to me said, "see, you don't need lard for it to taste good." i don't know about that for everything but this time it's true. i was just thinking, eating kosher is like living a fasted lifestyle  forever.  you can't eat so many things.  so is this scaring you at all?

      i think i'm still recovering from the fumes from last night. people are crazy after a certain time of night, especially if all you've been doing all day long is punching holes and trying to get the binding machine to work properly, eh?   look at   urlLink this  . i wonder if they think people are actually going to be buying things like this. but then again, i myself might order me some   urlLink loaves and fishes   one.   p.s. - RONSTER, i want to see sweet home alabama! i tried going this past weekend, but it was all sold out since it was opening night (i think.) BOO. HISS. ;) i heard that it's really cute, and reese definitely is now my favorite blond woman, no doubt.   ******************************************************* do's first crush: dutch boy named gavin in alice smith school in malaysia. when we tried out for the play "hansel and gretel", he got the part of hansel, a blond girl named elizabeth got the part of gretel, and i, dorice, got the part of the mean witch. and i must say that i played the meanest witch in alice smith school history.  i wonder how gavin is doing. probably off somewhere doing his dutch thing.

I can't help it, work is S-T-R-E-S-S-I-N-G me O-U-T. I was so knackered I just climbed on my bed and fell asleep when we came home last night... I didn't get the clothes off my bed, change, brush my teeth or even get under the covers... somehow, my glasses came off, (thanks do) and all I remember is esthie waking me up this morning...  *sigh...*  it feels kinda good to sigh, kinda like letting out steam from a pressure pot. eases the pressure... but I think it is stressing out the people around me. sorry folks...

      question: is this page only to be written on during work hours? i was just wondering.  what to share. i had chocolate covered raisins as part of my balanced breakfast. we're going to have pizza for lunch at the institute. it's also technically "cas" or casual day but i opted not to wear capris as i feel silly doing that these days.  oh oh yesterday was insane for the last couple of hours. i had to run to our minuteman printer twice in a row because we had last second additions to our conference program. oh oh and today my coworker and i are supposed to see  urlLink sweet home alabama  at union station. so dinner and movie. i'll tell you about it tomorrow. i only shared this preview because i can't think of anything else.  you're not going to believe this but the link button (and the bold and italic options among many other things) don't show up on my mac. i'm on a pc right now. MAN, macs always get the short end of the straw, and they don't even get to drink the milkshake!!!

      boo hoooo.  :(   check engine light at >100K = $$$$$  Hey, Mr. Crispy, how much would you expect replacing both upstream oxygen sensors to be ?  Parts & labor?  (any clues?) At Timonium when i had problems with Scrappy Doo (my camry) they were very very nice to me - free diagnostic, even if they had to check a whole bunch of things and it took forever to find the problem.  Maybe it was out of pity for an obviously poor young student type.  I don't feel quite the same sympathy now.. although i really can't afford much of anything right now either .. :( ________________________________________ Frojo jojo!   hullo. the bean and i were taking the bus in to work this morning (I took mr. ralph in yesterday) when I caught a glimpse of one very CUTE funky froed gal walking from the W******* to work..  ;)

      flo's 1st crush:  I was going through the link du jour and stumbled upon, lo and behold, my very first crush - which was a japanese anime by the way... well, between him and the little blond rebel in my kindergarten class, I can't really quite decide who was first...  (being that one is real and the other only 2D)  urlLink Arsene Lupin III  - the one in the red suit. He was so cool!  this japanese cartoon was apparently the granchild of  urlLink the original Arsene Lupin  (similar to sherlock, but way suave) his occupation was a gentleman crook.    I was just so stoked on seeing him again, I thought he was totally deadstock and not produced anymore :)

      I know, ahem, please excuse that last bit of sketch in the shout outs. Will you be part of the patrol?  I just had the  best tuna salad.  My coworker made it with Persian tuna (that's right bebe, Middle East quality yes no), pickles, Dijon mustard, a bit of mayo (full fat attack!), chopped hardboiled eggs...on toasted whole wheat with fresh slices of tomatoes. Open faced and in my face and down my throat it went. Mmm mmm, and I am so full now. I got some good laughs from the RAs and intern (remember "Flash"?). A little slice of heaven during this crazy crazy day. We're sizzling like bacon (that's for you girls!) in a pan over high heat.  To the  urlLink future!

       on my Moment of Dread.  R and Do, you've heard my stories of The parking attendant  in the garage i used to frequent.   Well, after months of waiting I got a monthly parking space in the church lot that's right next to that garage, right?  This was like two months ago.   I always felt kind of guilty?/ strange about it, and whenever i came in or left the lot i tried not to get noticed by that attendant.    Yesterday after work i was innocently and obliviously walking to my car when i looked up to see that parking attendant leaning on the railing facing my lot.  He of course spotted me, and there was nothing i could do but to wave hello.  He stared at me for a few seconds and then   yelled out  , "TRAITOR!  TRAITOR!"   Oh dear.   After recovering from the shock of it, I meekly replied, "It's  cheaper  here!"  Sigh.  at least I'm out of the closet now...no more sneaking around in fear. ----  --------- _____________________  whoa, the way things are going we may need to Raunch Patrol the links..!

      today's topic is baby joshua. what is it about him that breaks your heart? i got to spend saturday night and sunday morning with him :) saturday i was just holding him, and he wasn't really *doing* anything, but you should have seen me. i had a huge, almost stupid smile on my face the whole time. even sunday during nursery as he tried to eat my jacket, that little boy was just breaking my heart! obviously it helps that he's as cute as a button. him and his little croissant chin and brown fisherman sandals. i've already decided that he must have a band when he grows up: joshua and the heartbreakers. i can't wait until he can talk...to me that is!!! whenever sarah and sam are there, i call joshua "sahm," pronounced like the korean dish where you place bulgogi in lettuce. so it's sarah, sam, and "sahm."  otherwise, our office is getting busy preparing for next weekend's conference which i am excused from to attend kindred spirit. i'll be leading a tour group on friday. will any of you guys be going?

(had a nice, peaceful and productive day at work..)   I think about one post a day is good, and still hope to see some interesting and out-of-the-ordinary  shpeels  on random life tidbits  :)    // Rain, rain, rain.

      frodowhodo (f, if you're out there :) i think things started getting out of control when the shout out function was added. most of our time is consumed by reading other people's comments, no? if you really want things to simmer down, i suggest we halt shout out for the time being.  seriously.  i know, as much as i think shout outs are amusing, i have to admit it's the culprit. it's become a free-for-all in here. the guestbook is enough  creative space for others. so  frodowhodo,  what do you think?

      i've not been inspired enough to write a real one, but here's a little tribute that shall be my Assignment #3.   Mr. Foreign Man  I salute you. So much cuteness In a little man I would not have imagined.  With Curly hair and Greek accent you lug around your chain of keys greeting all who pass you by.  An older greek gentleman takes care of the cars in the church lot where i park now.  I had to ask him to move a car that was blocking me in when i was going to lunch... he carries ALL the cars' keys together on one enormous looped chain (among which my spare also hangs).  I can never make out a single word he says but I must say, he's really a sweet little man.

Maybe when I have lots and lots of time, I will transfer it all into an archived area and find new feedback sources.   we old mamas, we no use makeup ok? natural blog is good enough for me...

      (on a rainy grey day in downtown dc) a: hey, where did you get that umbrella? 1: i bought it from a bum r: a bum? you mean a vendor 1: no a bum. i bought it off of him a: you TOOK the bum's umbrella when it's raining outside? 1: no, i bought it off of him! i gave him ten dollars a: ten dollars? that's the worth of the umbrella. he didn't make anything b: what, you took an umbrella from a homeless guy? r: (laughing out loud by now) 2: yeh, 1 punched the homeless guy and took his umbrella!  1: but the umbrella has a hole in it. and the bum was really happy when i gave him the money c: you know, you can put tape over that hole 2: the bum didn't have legs! (starts singing, "i have no legs, i have no legs" which is supposedly from a disturbing movie called "kids") r: (laughs all the way to the bathroom)  yes. this is the kind of conversation that can happen at an office, a research institute, RIGHT before a policy event. 1=intern 1, 2=intern 2, a=coworker a, b=coworker b, c=coworker c, r=me  by the way, my sisters use xanga, which is supposed to be all the rage now. it's like blogger on steroids. i mean, it looks prettier, so i guess it wouldn't be steroids, so maybe blogger with a lot of makeup... and i bet you they don't have functions like shout outs that go on the fritz (that's a german name isn't it?) i'm also wondering, where is my boss?!

      man, what i wouldn't give for some good korean food right now.. I got me a HUMONGOUS craving for some  jjigae .   Jen said there's  kimchi jjigae  at Lexington Market now!  Is that  weird , of all things to serve there.  i wonder if they get dirty looks from their neighboring vendors.  // HEY, for those of us in this area: We should go see  Jonah , by BigIdea (makers of veggietales)!  And eat at Al Pacino's! (yeah!)  :)   our first "free" weekend in a long time's comin' up..

      random thought: y'know, people's writing and speaking styles can be SO DIFFERENT.  (i know different parts of your brain control writing and speaking.. is one left and the other right hemisphere?  there's that thingamajig in the middle that's supposed to be like the line of communication between them and all but i personally don't think it works that well. --i'm setting myself up to get crushed by Mister Mister, but das ok) Anyway since we're on the topic of poem writing -- i was just thinking that we've got some real poets among us, and it's kind of surprising cuz they sound nothing like their writing when they speak..  you read certain things that people write and you expect the author to be a certain way.. then you meet them and they're completely another way.  Know what i mean?    Anyway, that's cool.  I love human expression.  I love the written word, the subtleties that it allows you.  I LOVE visual arts!  I love dance and movement.  Music.  What an awesome range of emotions and ideas we're able to express, and in so many ways..! Audience of One's so great - letting all these forms of expression come out and be developed and come together in worship..  n'est-ce pas ?  by the way, i don't know why i'm so philosophical these days...

      lunch time poem  in the morning, I wake up and have toast and think about making eggs and go to work with my mug of coffee  in between work and coffee there are little goldfish crackers they frollick between my paper work little happy faces waiting to be devoured  and I anticipate lunch,  not for the lunch itself, but  for the lunch time that is time away from work  when I can no longer sit and type and wait at my desk I run off with glee doo-whopping to the falling of leaves and traipsing over cobblestones to an hour when I am freeeeee...

      ANTS ON A LOG celery sticks peanut butter raisins  wash celery sticks. cut them in half lengthwise and then cut them in half across (does that make sense? if it doesn't, just cut them into bits and pieces or however you please). spread peanut butter over the groove of the celery (if you still have a groove after the cutting into bits) and arrange raisins like little ants on a log (or like i said before, just do what you like, and if that means throwing the raisins EVERYWHERE, i won't whimper). now stand there at your kitchen counter, don't sit! eat the sticks, getting peanut butter all over your fingers and face and relive childhood. that's what i did last night. i couldn't believe how happy i was. almost like the time i dumped cookie dough into a pie pan and made myself some cookie pizza. i must have looked eight again. sorry it took me so long to finish assignment #2.

      i woke up @ 8:43am this morning, got ready in record time and made it to work by 8:58am.  thank goodness for the benefits of working 10 minutes away from home.   if you saw a girl with a crazed look on her face this morning running like mad, that would've been me.  to join in on the bandwagon and joining in on the  heated  discussions going about pets and all:  i love animals to death (fro, you know i don't mind having a pet around! it's just the cost, expenses, time, energy of having one seems a little over-the-top for us living on a tight budget and time right now, no?), but i also have to agree with ronster too. animals are animals. there are people starving, dying, while there's animals whose owners will spend $5,000 for a shot. i don't know...

      first it was that i'm a supposed extrovert. now i've realized just how transparent i am. people can tell right away if i'm "sad" because that's not how i am normally. this works against me, especially when i'd like to go unnoticed. so maybe i should just be quiet these days. (and just a note for everyone, i'd still like to think i'm an introvert. only i really know me right?)  so i begin here and now...

      good morning boys and girls,  you know it's going to be a bad day when you come in at 7:45, have your first cup of coffee and you already want to go home, then your friend from accounting tells you she's giving notice, and you both whoop and give each other high fives while your other friend is whimpering in the corner, makeup streaking all over her face, then we have to cheer her up and fix her face... big monthly meeting that I have to present in tomorrow, another 2 hour stupid let's change everything meeting on friday... Isn't it terrible that I complain about work when I should thank God I can even stay in this darned country at all...  when all is said and done, I am not brave enough, or good enough or have strength enough to love, to be patient, to be kind   and I fear, and I forget how to hope, I lose sight and I flounder how you would search me out every time, makes me wonder why I am worth anything to you, worth the heartbreaks, worth the cross, and I finally understand that I am not, but you did anyway, because you love me.

      i think the calendar was wrong. i think the first day of fall is today. BRRRRR. it took me a while to find my winter clothes this morning. it looks beautiful outside, but it's around 40 degrees supposedly.  speaking of hairy scary window washers, when they wash our windows it sounds like they're CRASHING into our building. we always forget (even though they give prior notice) which day they're supposed to come, and my boss and i never fail to scream and totally flip out when one of the guys CRASHES into our window. CRASH and BASH and SMASH and MASH.  a conversation from this weekend: r: j, how do you get to... s: hey, why don't you come eat with us r: (looks at s who is flanked by two cali brothers and realizes what he's doing) um, we're already finished eating s: (raises one eyebrow) so are  we  (a long awkward silence follows...) j: (gets up looking a little embarassed)  R,  let me introduce you to x and y x and y: hi, what's up, how do you do who do you do (ok, ok, they didn't really say THIS part) r: it's nice to meet you (runs away)  yeh, we're becoming a rare species us singles. but gosh darnit we will survive!!!

      Wow ok, that was scary.   So nobody at my work is ever told about anything right?  (In part cuz I have hands down the  craziest  secretary woman, i'll have to tell you stories about her some other time - her name's Veronica.  R, remember?)  Anyway, these two scroungy looking men come around to my cubicle.  They're just like, "hi" as they walk across to my window.  The older one (he must be sixty-something) fights the window open and  climbs outside .  I don't have a balcony or anything, mind you.  Not really much of a ledge either, really.  I'm frozen in my seat thinking, What the..!  Is he going to JUMP?   Don't worry though, i never noticed the little latches next to the windows before.  The old guy latched himself to those with a belt he was wearing and the second guy handed him a window wiper thing.  When they finished up the old guy climbed back in.  whew. What a scary way to clean windows.  I wish they would inform us of things like that.. i almost made a scene.  There's lots of older folk here too who might get a heart attack or something.

      // so i went on another field trip this morning, with three of my coworkers. Toured one of our water plants, a small dam and Ashburton Lake.   On the way back (in our wonderful city vehicle) we saw a nice, new-looking white camry by the side of the road with its front end completely on FIRE.  Like actual flames, and a bunch of black smoke coming from the engine & under the front of the car.   Poor thing, i wonder what happened.. (don't worry i'm sure the passengers were out of there & standing somewhere far away)  //  JONAH !  :) Yay, I finally get to see it for reals this time  :)  ..Al Pacino, some other time (but  soon  i hope).  //IT'S FRIDAY!  And a beautiful one too  :)  // On the Assignments , ro, you've got to start your own ones or they'll never start.  like i've drawn a  complete  blank (which isn't hard, i've got a really bad memory) on ANY actual funny moments with frodo.. isn't that crazy.  (& I'm itching to do some assignments too-- All-time Favorite Movies; Authors who shaped your writing style..)  //  from one of the better mass forwards i've received : "When you were born, you were crying And everyone else around you was smiling. Live your life in such a way That when you die, You will be smiling  And everyone else around you will be crying."

      ...it's one of those days at the institute where murphy's law is at work. one thing after another, going wrong or leaving an ugly mark. right now i just left a heated debate between the research assistants on what it takes to be a leader. they don't think president bush is one, especially in the context of the middle east. and for some reason, i could  not  bring myself to his defense. i was boiling inside, but i kept quiet. i was without comment. what's wrong with me? why do i not speak up when it counts?! it doesn't really matter when i speak at other times, but this time it mattered.   ...what am i made of? mashed potatoes i've concluded.

      on a lighter note, i'm talking with an upper-management type from a consultant firm right, he's leaning against/propping a door open with his right hand above his head, and as he's talking, with his left hand reaches under his sweater and starts scratching his tummy / rib area.  i mean, he had a shirt on under it so it's not like i saw skin or tummy hairs (!!) or anything, but it was very very distracting.  He's all scratching away as he pleases while keeping a straight face and talking on and on.   Do people who do this kind of thing not realize what they're doing?  And he's not an old guy either, like you might think.  oh well, it gave me a good laugh on the elevator ride down..

      i woke up this morning to the news that  urlLink north korea  has admitted to having nuclear weapons capability. questions: why did they admit this now? what do they want with this admission? will this complicate the campaign against iraq? how does this fit into the war on terror? what is the u.s. going to do? all these thoughts were going through my mind and so i didn't even care that i was getting up earlier than usual for work.   listen, i'm not for war, but i am against unstable regimes headed by even more unstable dictators. i cannot  believe  that the international community has let, there's no other word for it, lunatics like saddam and kim jongil stay in power for this long. history repeats itself with them, and it seems we've learned very little from the past.  and europe, the russians, they wonder why we're becoming frantic, why we feel the need to act. because they're doing nothing. worse yet, they've exacerbated the situation, for example with russia, by providing north korea with arms.  and i had this whole crazy story about couriers planned! i'll write it next time. we need to pray, think, and strategize as a country. it's times like this that i want to work for the bush administration even more.

      i love reading the paper, even if it's at night. so at 11:30 p.m. yesterday, i settled down on the floor of my room with the la times (it's just what i happened to have for the day) and started reading. i felt a bit hungry, so i decided to make soba noodles. i haven't had that in so long. the noodles cooked perfectly, and i was eating away, so happy while reading. and then it hit me. minus the reading glasses, i had become my dad. he always gets cravings for noodles at night, and he always reads the paper before he goes to sleep. i never thought that imitating your parents was a bad thing. it's unavoidable anyway, but i rather like it...  ...no online version of the news can substitute for a newspaper that you can touch and crumple and let the printed ink stain your fingers. there's something about the feeling of paper, and reading from one, that will never grow antiquated.

      random thoughts  as usual, fall decided to make a cameo and it feels like winter has settled in with his cold, cold mornings. i sleep with my socks on now, and if you know me, you KNOW i like being barefoot. last night i kept tossing and turning so i tucked my pj pants into my socks, which were the tight korean ones by the way. i thought, my my, if only someone could see me under these covers (mc hammer would be proud). almost like the time liz ripped off my blankets sophomore year and left me feeling so vulnerable...  depending on the metro driver, you can have a very smooth or spastic ride. whenever there's a sudden halt, i tend to fly all over the metro car. for example, this morning i was in my usual stance: standing with feet slightly apart, leaning on the wall of the car, black bag on right shoulder, lunch bag in left hand, reading bible with right hand. the car made a sudden halt and i was flung slightly; well, i thought it was slightly but a lady looked up at me and all i could do was laugh. at myself, because it was so embarassing...  there's this homeless man who walks around farragut north, but i've passed by him in dupont as well. he's either chinese or korean, really small with shoulder-length grey hair, and he carries this walking stick that's as tall as he is. i've wondered about him because he's asian. 90% of the homeless people here are black, the rest are white, but this is the only asian guy i've seen. this morning he was walking by and singing. everyone, including me, stared at him. if he were cleaned up, if he didn't walk around aimlessly (or maybe he  is  going somewhere), he could be any of my friend's grandfathers. he has a "i've seen him before in the form of a father/uncle/etc." face, so it makes me sad...  a lady was leaving the bathroom just as i was walking in. she left this fragrant trail, and it smelled like this english lotion my mom uses. i think it's called DuBarry. it looks like milk but smells like flowers, and my mom has to go to this korean store that sells non-korean goods for visiting koreans to take back to korea. yaah, right. so i thought of my mom and missed her this morning...  (it still smells like my mom's lotion. no, i don't need a new comforter, i just need management to turn on the heat. yes, i think we are definitely biased for feeling more compassion for homeless asians, but what can we do. and maybe it's fall, maybe it's winter. i have a headache, headache)  chex mix is hands and feet down  the best.  after eating rold's gold pretzel mix and other concoctions, i miss chex. have you tried their honey flavor? ...fro, are you out there? :(

      zippity dooda zippity ay my oh my what a wonderful day plenty of sunshine  comin my way zippity dooda zippity ay.  ..was it just me, growing up in quaint little maryland ?  i remember singing songs like this, and  Yankee Doodle Dandy , and  My Country Tis of Thee  in elementary school.  After roll-call and the Pledge of Allegiance, both first grade classes and both second grade classes would sit against the walls of the hallway we shared, and sing these songs together.  Most of them must date back to  Colonial  times!   now i wonder, did the teachers already know them or was it a requirement to learn them when they were hired..??   I had forgotten all about this til recently..  (thanx to Dooda)    Anyway, I feel American when I hear those songs, as silly and outdated as they are..

      baltimore, i'll be visiting you tonight :)  de: what a wonderful idea fro: please don't tell me you spent the night at work  i've never seen so many working mothers. they're only apparent to me because i see women in suits with babies on the metro. the other day i saw a mom reading to her son on the crowded metro. she leaned down and whispered every line of the story into his ear while he sat in his stroller, and they were in their own world. well, i was kind of in there with them since i was *staring.* i couldn't help it, standing right there and all :) this morning i saw daycare workers taking the tods for a stroll. by that i mean strollers that could fit four to five tods. so cute with their little feet dangling and wearing tiny jackets, babbling in their mini oxen cart (that's what it looked like!). what is it about little things or people that makes you so happy?

      thanks ro :) sigh... sometimes I wish the rent could pay itself and I could just curl up in my comforter until the end of time.   while I was walking back from lunch, I think I saw a couple of snowflakes (?!?!) they might have been a proliferation of white dust, pretty big and clean looking white dust, heck, in B'more, you can never really be sure...  talking about snow, here's  fro's embarrassing story #2   O nce upon a time in 2000, fro stayed late at school to do some work (either programming or writing a paper or something extremely mentally tasking...). at that time, the entire campus was going through this huge construction, so all the roads were ripped up, and you had to take 10 minute detours to go from one building to another. so this is late at night in the dead of winter, fro walks out of HAC lab to find a lovely fresh powdering of snow all over campus. in her delirium, she strolls past the freshmen dorms, loving the winter wonderland. now the road she was walking on was (like i mentioned above) ripped up, so the whole track was covered with snow, and one of fro's favorite pass-times is to make new tracks in the snow, so she was just busy doing that and basically happy to be alive. all of a sudden, the ground went from under her feet, and she went flying, feet first into the air, landing on her behind (this sounds awfully familiar...) trying to stand up, she slipped and fell again... what in the world?!?! no it was not ice. it was a strategically positioned large black plastic tarp the workmen had placed on the road to protect whatever was under it. the wonderful layer of fresh snow was the perfect camouflage for luring unknowing and out-of-it fros who were walking home. there was like no friction at all, and all fro could do was swim on the darn sheet of plastic. so fro (in a very dignified manner) crawled to the edge of the tarp, where fortunately there was a lamp post. with all the upper body strength she could muster, she pulled herself up and off the darn tarp.   now the most embarrassing thing wasn't the actuall falling or floundering on the ground, or the pair of freshmen who shared the whole experience with me from the steps of their dorm, but that you could see a perfect butt mark on the snow where i fell... sheesh, this snow thing man, gotta be careful...  this ends part two of   fro's embarrassing stories    see you next time folks!

      oh fro...i know. yesterday, maybe an hour before the end of the workday, a near-catastrophe happened, and i promise it wasn't my fault. still, i got involved somehow, and i was sitting in front of my computer, couldn't say much, felt dizzy, wondered how i had become entangled in such a web, wanted to run somewhere like a forrest gump...but i had to suck it up and finish the day.   about the voice raising an octave higher -- that is definitely a female thing. it happens to me, to my mom, my sisters, my friends, almost every woman i know. let me rephrase: every  asian  woman i know. i don't want to propagate stereotypes, but it's a cultural casualty.   my boss left for texas two days ago. one task she gave me was to water her plants, all ten of them. i asked how often she wanted them watered. oh, when you see them withering. but wouldn't that signify they were already dying?! some of the plants are in very high places which means that i'm lifting up the pitcher of water and just praying very quietly inside that it'll hit the soil and not my head. yes, and the carpet is a bit wet now. there's this one plant that she refuses to throw away, and it's some mutation between two species that she keeps near my desk. every time i look at it i shudder and i have to ask her again, can we please get rid of this little shop of horrors? hmm...maybe now is the time...

      how does it feel to have 3 people with the combined work experience that is about 2 times your age tell you you made a stupid mistake? I feel this -> ' . ' small right now.   thank you very much, older more experienced people, i know i suck. i shall try to hide behind my computer monitor now.   "I shall do better next time" just sounds pathetic when it comes out of my mouth... i'll stuff it with chips now... why does my throat get all fuzzy when I am befuddled? is there a scientific explanation that when fros get upset, their voices raises an octave and gets all fuzzy??

      It's a scary thing to bring bulk packages of food to work.   At home, you can at least pretend that your roommates pigged out too, but at work it's just you.  I was just munching on my sesame peanut crunchies* when i noticed how little was now left in the 1-lb. tub.  Not that i worry about getting fat(ter) - maybe i should start worrying just a little more, hm.  But just the thought that all those little tan-colored balls are now, in some form, sitting in my body.    * from do&i's lunch outing to the Canton WholeFoods (they're great, they had all kinds of samples out: salmon chowder, seafood sausages, gourmet cheeses.. mmm.)   //fro!  i wonder the same thing about lost clothing!  my favorite black tee, my great sweatshirt-jacket, an off-white cardigan i loved to death.. all gone.  and i miss them dearly.

      I realized, when i was walking back from lunch, that when I have a tough day at work and have no time to really eat, I always take a short lunch to go shopping... the art store and the rite aid behind my work absolutely adore me to bits.   today in my shopping bag ->  Rite Aid: 1 toblerone 1 ferrero rocher 1 neutrogena face wash (on sale) 1 vanilla coke 1 Wahoos (they're new, kinda like bugles corn chippy thingees)  Plaza art store: 1 30"x40" canvas 1 silver acryllic paint (by the way, did anyone see my last tube? it disappeared...) 1 pearlescent medium for acryllics (my last one disappeared w/ the silver paint) 1 plastic protective sleave for artwork  question: where do those things that randomly disappear go? you know the odd sock, the odd pen, the odd glove...

      *it's a beautiful morning* (do you know the rest of the lyrics?)  i was running late this morning, but when i got on the metro, it was pretty crowded. i have  always  wondered about all those other people. i want to lean over and quietly ask the person next to me, "are you late too?" and since this is dc and not ny, i won't get a beat-down.   someone  suggested i purchase a Kevlar Helmet and Flak Vest during these uncertain times. so first the goof inside me said: "yeh, i'll be the most stylin' commuter," and then the logical side of me said, "no, because i'm actually safer here. ironically, the suburbs have become more dangerous," and then the little voice in the middle said,  oh d_ve, don't be so silly!   *fro, that was quite an odyssey you shared. it's gonna be hard to top that, but we'll try... *de, i'm thinking about sleeping over on friday night. would that be ok with you?

      speakin' of turkeys, here's a funny one for ya.  fro crajee story #1  The year was 1999, and it was Thanksgiving. The place was H-House. Fro was spending her first real Shanksgiving American style with the turkey, cranberry sauce and the whole hoop-lah. Major culprits - the Schmitzer and yours truly.   so here's fro, who's cooking experience back then involved packets of ramen and boiling water was trying to help Schmitz with the 2 titanic turkeys, one in 500 and the other in Carol's apt. It was a big day, so I slept over at H-House. Schmitz was up bright and early with the turkeys. First things first, we took the baggies of insides out of the turkey, and rubbed them down good with tons of buttery goodness with all sorts of herbs and what not. Since we were poor college folk, we didn't have proper equipment, so we had to use those tin foil pans that you can only use once.   so the turkeys were happily roasting away, and we were busy with the 4 bags of potatoes we were to mash. we moved out of the kitchen so that we could watch the NY parade while mashing the taters. we would occasionally get up to baste the birds, and then we would resume mashing and cranberry sauce making... after a while, schmitz had to go to carol's to check and baste that bird, so off she went, while i was still messing around with the potatoes in 500.   i went back into the kitchen to do some-sing, probably to boil more potatoes. While I was busily doin ma thang, i suddenly realize that there seemed to be a really thick fog in the kitchen area. by this time, the whole apt was so warm that the windows were all steamed over, and I don't know why in the world i didn't notice the thick smoke coming out of the oven earlier, but i didn't. so smartee that i am, i opened the oven where billows of thick grease smoke put me in a chokehold. After franticly fanning away the smoke, I realize (yes, only then) that something was tragicly wrong. my fist instinct was to save the food, so i tried to wrestle the turkey, which took the combined strength of schmitz and myself to settle it in the oven even when it was cold, out of the oven. those flimsy wimsy tin foil things are not worth jack, but somehow either schmitz came right back, or God gave me miraculous strength, the turkey was out of the oven and sitting on the oven door.   here lies the problem, turkey on oven door, billows of greasy smoke, what the heck was wrong, how did this all happen? the darn turkey, vengeful even after death, decided to puncture flimsy wimsy tin foil thingee with one of it's bones, so turkey juice + tons of grease was dripping onto the metal parts of the oven, thus creating the wonderful San Franciscan fog effect where we couldn't even see the ceiling.   what to do? what to do? so we went to a leetle indian run mini-mart (God bless them) and bought another tin foil pan to line the already punctured one, then we placed the combined pans onto a baking sheet.   the turkey turned out just fine, a little on the dry side, but hey, after all that, i'm surprised it was edible.   ah, ah-meh-lee-kah, what memories, what larks.   p.s. preaj excuse spelling errors, am feeling dyslexic today.

      *you girls tickle me pink* and please don't get me started on embarassing, mortifying, most humbling events as they happen to me everyday.   is it just me or are you thinking about thanksgiving already? i'm wondering what the family, i mean what  i'll  end up cooking this year. last year my mom made me responsible for the turkey, which was so big that i needed my sister's help to flip. also, i left the packaged gizzard inside the turkey while it roasted happily in the oven. my sister was like, "OMG VERN, you left that in?!" i think i was already eating the meat by then. it was good though! ok, shhhh, don't share this with anyone, you know, besides everyone on the world wide web. sometimes you forget that, don't you? that this is out there, for all the people to read. dooroorooroo dooroorooroo...  *aww de, i know what you mean. just keep your chin up carrying lunch to your boss or reshelving books. ehh...hehe, that's what  i  do. *fro, if you are a pork bun, i'm going to eat you :) again, we've missed you so.

      on Pain-in-the-Buns. I'm sure almost all of you have this:  at your job you've got your actual job tasks, and then you've got those random Pain-in-the-Buns tasks.  The sad,  tragic  thing is... today it really hit me how much more of the latter type of work is going to get DUMPED on me.  Sorry if i'm complaining but just to give you some idea, we have a consultant working full-time on just this THING, and it's supposed to all get transferred over to me, as a "SIDE" thing, on top of my regular job?  {{boohoo}} ...I need a crew of smart, hard-working interns ASAP..  on Refrigerator Art. sigh, only a mom would do this.  i just got off the phone with mine, and she informed me that there was new 'decoration' in the house.  She had gone out and bought frames for all my  embarrassingly  bad, half-finished paintings from middle school and high school.  Can I say, Embarrassing!  She hung them all over the house, she said, and "they look really good".  I guess that's what moms are for, even to the point of blurring judgement..   Aww, i really ought to go visit her.

      hello...  anybody home?...  this is kinda sad without the shout outs, but still, I am glad of the returned sanity.  It takes a little getting used to though.   fro's embarrassing story #1  fro was on the ice hockey team her senior year in high school. ok, ok, don't start laughing already, there's more. It was a big thing for the area to have a girl's hockey team, so the TV crew came to take footage of one of our first games. fro didn't know how to skate before she joined the hockey team, so i don't know why in the world they let her in, but they did, maybe cause it was the first team ever, + they felt bad for the leetle asian girl. The pottery teacher was the coach. anyways..., so pre-game, there was always warm-up, when each team would skate around their half of the ring pretending to look tough and intimidating and cool and all that sort of stuff. My friends were in the stands cheering us on, and we come on the ice. (reminder: fro could just about skate then, but couldn't stop + had very little control in general) so the TV crew - Channel 2 news was on the sidelines filming at one of the doors (I don't know if they were filming live?!?!), and here comes #30 (das me by the way). fro was fine the first lap round, and then, the 2nd lap, here she was coming around, and whop on her butt she fell, right in front of the camera. Absolutely lovely debut! and was she not glad of the visored helmets.   anyways, i don't really find it embarrassing as much as funny, but it comes close.   sidenote: after I shaved my head, after practice when I took the helmut off on the ice, steam would come off my head like it were a dim sum steamed pork bun... *sigh* those were the days...  i had a lack of things to say, but i thought i might cheer y'all up by telling you some of the stupid things i done when i was more stupid than i am now.

I drove all the way from Penn -> B'more through tollbooths and bad traffic, and I'll have to drop her off at the train station today.   i miss my dad already, it's sadder to leave your parents when they look a little older everytime you see them, or maybe cause I am older, and realize more how much it takes to be a parent and watch your kids go away.   ode to daddy-doo   my dad big 'ol dad big 'ol teddy bear dad grumpy dad funny grumps is my dad i love 'ol funny grumps my dad i miss you dad  :(  fro's  dang i hate that i missed  list: * jeff serles - concert + I didn't know that there was a seminar after church ?!?!?!?! * remnant - couldn't get out to manhattan from boon-hicksville NJ, Dada refused to drive into Manhattan, I hear him though... * jonah - was working till 8.30 pm on friday, so no fun. 1st 12 hr day (didn't take lunch) pity me, pity me, ok, das enough * my brother growing up - when i left home at 14, he was 5, now he is 14. where did my baby brother go? by the way, he's 6' 2" now.   why is fro such a sap today?   p.s. I lent my vcr to a co-worker on thursday (dont' ask) then, she returned it on friday. since I was working late, I was walking all over Mt.

      de: hehe, i liked the soybean malt proverb better.  uh-oh. so before i fell asleep last night i felt a lump in my throat. i thought, this better not be me getting sick. i woke up this morning and the lump was still there. my throat feels a little scratchy, my voice is cracking a bit like a teenage boy's... and i found out that the "sick" coworker that i talked face to face with yesterday actually had pneumonia. NOTE: if you're sick, stay at home!!! don't go into work and spread it!!!  fro: i think i know what you mean. i've woken up very disturbed by certain dreams. do you wonder where in the world some of them come from? but i couldn't help cracking up at the fact that do was a part of one of your unpleasant dreams. OH DO, where are you?!  ...these macs are driving me crazy...hm, i don't know. we can think about upgrading our blogger. on racism: yesterday i was walking to the bank when i saw this homeless guy. we had very brief eye contact, but he started yelling profanities at me. i just blocked it out (this is a talent of mine), but he ended the verbal assault with "go home."  that  i heard loud and clear. and i thought, "home"? i'm assuming he meant china since that's probably where he thinks i'm from. i wasn't really mad, just upset. upset that he's homeless, and he's angry, and he's certainly not going to get any money from me. and sad that racism still exists, even in downtown dc, and that it still hurts me.

       recent dreams  i've been having really vivid dreams these days. yesterday on my way back from work, i saw two gloves lying on the ground. i felt so bad for whoever lost them. they were just plain gloves made of fleece and wool, respectively, but i had been looking for my own gloves (which i finally found). that was the other thing, i had been wondering where i had stored my scarves and gloves because it's been so cold lately. ANYWAY, so i had a dream that someone handed me a pair of gloves last night. i thought it was real.   when you're having a completely outrageous dream, do you think, "hey! this can't really happen!" in the middle of your dream?! i do this. i think i'm practical down to the bone. also, when you're having a really pleasant dream, do you try not to wake up? hehe, i'm guilty of doing this a lot. and finally, when you flip sides in your bed, does it alter your dream? yes, yes, and yes.

      About that glow-in-the-dark cake, yo, that's nasty.  actually there weren't any pic's.. i guess i can't say that til i see it; But what happened to good old fashioned natural foods?   esp. with desserts and sweets, everything has to be dyed blue or black or something gross like that, or bleached white.  yeccch.  We eat way too many chemicals and preservatives.  EVERY day...

      on the contrary. i think it is the very fact that my dad chose to stay in the states, and the fact that we are *here*, right now, that tells me about what my parents valued and envisioned. i'm thankful that i'm living in america. i can't imagine growing up in korea anymore. so don't worry, because it's true, your actions speak louder than your words.

      America, family, jobs: too many emotions with too few words...  sometimes, I think about if God calls me to stay in the States, and if I have children who will grow up here, they will know nothing that I hold precious, and they would not care to know, and it frightens me. I wonder if my mother is feeling the same way...

      wasn't last night frijjing? and so rainy. my dad got stuck on 695 and 495 for almost two hours. when he finally got to my apartment, we were both really hungry.   v: dad, i have to tell you something. woomi garden only has a buffet during lunch d: (looking crestfallen) it's not buffet for dinner? v: (not knowing whether to crack up or be sad with him, i go for the latter) but we can go to a buffet if you want! d: let's go to ilmee buffet v: (realizing she's going to overeat if that's the case. thinks about it for a split second) yeh, let's go!  you've seen me eat right? now imagine ronnie senior, who can pack it in three times as much as i can. we ate SO much bbq meat last night. i was going strong the first round, feeling a bit fatigued the second round, but gained my strength back for the last round. KO! (that's knockout in boxing, no?) by the end of the night, we both smelt like marinated, grilled kalbi.  i found out another interesting thing about my dad. so before i was born, in a land far, far away that smells like kimchi, my dad was an engineer with daewoo. he came to the united states partly because he volunteered (he was smitten by american chocolate given out by GIs at an early age. he's a "western thinker" in many ways), and partly because they needed to transfer people to the U.S. branch. my mom did  not  want to go, but i've always known this. what i didn't know was that my dad quit daewoo to stay in the states. they were going to send him back after three years, but i suppose he thought living in the states was his destiny. so he made that decision to leave an enviable job, the rest of his family in korea, and try to pursue the american dream with only his wife and three daughters.   he told me this in the car as we were driving back last night. "that's not fair!" was my first reply. "why couldn't they have let you stay? why was your only choice to quit?" he said that was the way it worked back then. there was no system to let you stay on longer. i was quiet for a long time, and i tried to imagine what he must have gone through, making that decision. deciding for the rest of us what our future would be like...  i saw again that there's a lot of my dad in me.

      ew... dennis you have a stalker!!! do you even know who he is? is he all old and disgusting? is he on your floor?  fro's suggestions: a. ignore him b. ask fro to beat him up c. send him computer virus through email d. build water pipe system to discharge sewage in his cubicle e. put mouse on sticky trap on his desk f. put sticky traps on his chair  g. reply to his email "how do I feel?!?! How would you feel if you had a creepy stalker person sending you innaproriate and wierd emails you don't care to receive you wierdo?" h. all of the above  why do my suggestions mostly orient around physical abuse? I don't know, but I don't like the sound of him.  it's all the fault of your snow white big eyes babe. I will protect you at all cost! ... I just realized option a. contradicts the rest of the options, so I hereby change option a. to do all of below and pretend you don't know what happened. but realistically dear, I would ignore him, and if he still bothers you, tell your supervisor. ok? be safe honeybunches, there are a ton of wierdos out there...

      The way my coworker was teasing another coworker yesterday reminded me of my brother when we were growing up.   I'm telling you, he used to have an  uncanny skill  for finding my greatest weaknesses and knew exactly how to probe them,  and thoroughly enjoyed doing it, as a great joke .  He couldn't stand seeing me be very serious about anything, or start being all up on myself.  I guess it was just too tempting for him.  As much as I despised it then (and being young, you know you make a really big deal about everything anyway, and the worst of it is that there's nowhere for you to go, cuz you live with him you know), I think back and it makes me laugh.  I guess it turned out to be a good thing -- you know, building character, keeping me from thinking too highly of myself, that kind of thing.  Siblings are such a funny funny thing.  And I miss my (punk) brother, he never calls anymore...  // ok, the same guy just emailed me again today - "Good morning Denice How are you today?" freeeaky.  what does he want??  whatdaheck do i do..?  // oh yeah, and the poor mouse fell for one of the sticky traps overnight.  (I  tried  to tell you to get out, little one..!)

I am definitely and will always be against daylight savings .  i heard that ben franklin came up with the idea as a joke, but somehow we ended up doing it.  Crazy, making a whole country to turn their clocks twice a year.   The rest of the world is normal.  (i don't think anybody else does it do they??)

[And I appreciate Darren Clarke so much.. not just for his GREAT electrics, but he just seems so grounded.  know what i mean?]  It's just such a  blessing  to be exposed to other Christian leaders running for the Lord in their calling, and also get a sense of what all is going on spiritually nationwide.  //  also- what in the world are you supposed to do when a stranger emails you, "Good Morning Denice".

Osborne - i think it will take me a while to digest the things he taught us this weekend * dive ins - bacon bits, bacon bits! * crazy green yarn - am knitting new scarf (for myself? for anyone who's nice to me?) looks like sorbet/ lemon lime candy :) * dori's b-day present - trying to finish it, will be done by the end of the year... I know, I know... p.s. her birthday was in August. * flea market - I love ghetto cheap everything - 10 packets of chips for $1, kettle korn from mr. korean man * a------ mills - is evil, it sucks you in and takes the spark out of your eyes (i got a brown corduroy skirt) * NY city ballet workout video - attempted, and gave up after warm ups.  * sleep - so good, so needed. i wish there was more of it, but there wasn't, still it was good.

      how can one's writing style be separated from favorite books or who you think are great authors? well... I suppose there are great authors out there whose style I don't fully appreciate...  mine are quirky: Salman Rushdie, T.S. Elliot, Franz Kafka, Roald Dahl, Dashiell Hammett, Richard Wright, Gerald Durrel... Joseph Heller - Catch 22... oh of course there's Hemingway "Hills Like White Elephants" and if you haven't read any Durrel, look up "My Family and Other Animals" I've read that like 12-million times! it's so hilarious! there are a bunch of poets I can't remember the names of...  poet, poets, poets - William Carlos Williams, Wilfred Owen, so so many more... mostly in the  urlLink modern era  of course, ever since i could read, i have read and reread  urlLink his  poetry to the bone and marrow. I think poetry really sculpted the way I write and think. ... oh my gosh, did I miss Fitzgerald? and Ezra Pound?  and... and... ok I'll stop now.  p.s. there's this strange but awesome genius Brian Andreas who illustrates and writes a collection called  urlLink Story People

       Writers  who influenced my writing:  funny that i should be bringing up this topic?  maybe.  being that it's been a few years since i've really read (and now i'm just  the Engineer ).  but i know rofrodo'll have a lot to say (do, control yourself, this is not the place for a full bibliography!).   [This is about writing STYLE by the way, NOT favorite books or great authors]  here are a couple of my near-and-dear:  truman capote .  it's been a while since i've read anything of his, but there was a time in high school when i couldn't get enough.  i don't think he wrote a single thing of extreme importance, really, but he was one talented writer.   The  way  he said what he said , mmm.  (That's a deep,  appreciative  mmm.)  clive staples lewis .  you knew this one was coming i know.  but how sweet was Narnia?  and his sci-fi trilogy was great.  very inspiring, very smart man. some other  british  authors.  i got into british writing a bit late, but with c.s. and roald dahl and George Eliot and all, sometimes i catch myself writing british (and saying things out to myself with an english accent!).  oh, and Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen) - Out of Africa.  Beautiful. that's who comes to mind right now..  i never much got into Russian.  And there were many more that stick out that were really powerful, but more for content than for writing style (George Orwell comes to mind...man, he was something else!)..

      hello friends.   i called in sick today - elway made me.   i was still going to stubbornly go in cuz of all the stuff i have to do, but she's like, "it's just work.. and you're going to get your coworkers sick.  get some REST."  It's a good thing she talked some sense into me too cuz i'm realizing now how much i needed it.   hm..what to read today?  I think if i'm conscious enough, i'll read something more substantial like one of those VanGemeren books i bought.. or maybe just watch movies.. ...it would all be so much more fun with a buddy...

      hm,  h o u s e s  eh?   Nicely toned walls (None o that  eh just paint it all Eggshell White  if i can help it)..  maybe with white molding.  and maybe have  fun  colors in a couple rooms. Nice big kitchen of course Lots and lots of cupboards and a nice big pantry and humongo walk-in closets and all kinds of other storage space.   Fro's attic for crafts sounds wonderful.  but maybe just one uncarpeted room for a studio/ crafts & projects room would do. Rocking chairs and lounge chairs and a fireplace. A big backyard with a treehouse and a tire swing  an orchard of different fruit trees would be  very nice .

(we went out to Matsuri's yesterday..forgot how good sushi was :)  - i bought myself a sad sad imitation of sushi for lunch today.  //  Enlighten me, what does this  mean  exactly?  (I saw it in the window of a nearby cafe-- they always have these three cute pig figures holding three little chalkboards with a new saying every week) Pig1)    Never place a period Pig2)    where God has placed Pig3)    a comma.  ..oh, ok.  i think i get it now.  (excuse me, i'm kind of slow-in-the-head esp these days.  probably coughed out a whole lung by now too)  //  I couldn't get onto the page either..still can't.. Ok i'm in now and YEAH, that kitty litter's reallyreally gross.  EAACCK.  I cannot believe they tell you to go buy a kitty litter pan and pooper scooper.  I don't care if it's new, those things should never touch human food..!!!

(those walk-in ones) *cream-colored carpet with scotchguard *lots and lots of grassy lawn and sturdy, shade-giving trees *a garden next to flo's and de's

      hold up. for the record, i'd like to state that i LOVED prince of egypt. the animation, the story, the songs -- all gorgeous. the problem i had with joseph was that besides the nonsensical lyrics, there was one scene where he RUNS LIKE A HYENA. yes folks, like a hyena, on all fours, and frothing at the mouth. it scared me. if you don't know what i'm talking about, go over to flo's and watch the scene in slow-mo.

       Corned Beef and Cabbage  has got to be one of my favorite foods.  YUM.  They actually had it at my lunch place today (i'm eating chopstickfuls of it as I write).  Some things I'm thankful for (and I'll leave off most of the obvious ones): 1. My job.  It's not the most glamorous, and it's definitely not all fun-and-games, but I am genuinely thankful for it.   2. AMC.  I know this is an 'obvious one' but I'm so very thankful.  I love the way God loves our Body. 3. Stories and storytelling.  ..So I finished reading all about the adventures of Huckleberry Finn yesterday.  (It was all I could manage to do all day...no eye exam, no contacts, no voting, no studying my insurance options like i wanted to.  When the time came, i drove myself to Tues Nite but was all shaken up whenever anyone passed me, or water splashed my windshield..) 4. Cruise control.  I use it excessively, every chance I get.  :)

I don't know what's up with that, but it's  vicious, vicious i say !  the brother's site is booby-trapped!

      it's so weird being home alone during the day.  reminds me of high school or something when i was sick (or skipping!...did i used to skip?  I'm pretty sure I did..) and stayed home.   It's surprising how many phone calls you get.  Loads and loads of telemarketers of course... makes you not want to answer the phone.  Then someone who used to live here (one of the dozen women who have rotated through this house, from back in the TMB days).  Then my mom (i almost didn't answer this one, it's a good thing I did). Anyway, keep me company, so as i don't get too lonesome (I've been reading Huckleberry Finn, and sipping on hot lemon tea.)

(e.g. is there any disadvantage in getting a smaller-bodied guitar?) maybe friday night?  you guys would flip if you saw me now. i'm making a mess in the living room with my tissues, blanket, mug...and yet, i have no desire to be neat today :D

      ohh, i'm sick and should be at home too.  But here I am at work.  I would've called in sick but i had to go to a mtg at city hall this morning, couldn't bail out of it.  I'm considering going home early (i feel awful :(  )  but they kind of frown on that.. it seems even sick days you're supposed to get advanced approval on (which makes no sense.).  We'll see how long I last.   Of course, I do get tomorrow off, for election day.  :)     Are y'all voting?  Also, Do you know a good (cheap) place to get contacts & an eye exam?  My contacts are probably two years old now.  If I don't feel awful tomorrow I was thinking about going to get new contacts.. somewhere.  :(  I want a nice warm backrub and lots of hot Citron tea.  And maybe one of those great big lounging chairs I can fall asleep in (in front of a toasty fire).

      here ro (dori's co-worker sent it to her...):  Retarded Grandparents   A teacher asked her young pupils how they spent their vacation.  One child wrote the following about her retired Grandparents:  We always used to spend the holidays with Grandma and Grandpa.  They used to live here in a big, brick house, but Grandpa got retarded and they moved to Florida and now they live in a place with a lot of other retarded people.  They live in a tin box and have rocks painted green to look like grass.  They ride around on big tricycles and wear name tags because they dont know who they are anymore.  They go to a building called a wrecked center, but they must have got it fixed because it is all right now.  They play games and exercises there, but they dont do them very well.  There is a swimming pool too, but they all jump up and down in it with their hats on.  I guess they dont know how to swim.  At their gate there is a dollhouse with a little old man sitting in it.  He watches all day so nobody can escape.  Sometimes they sneak out.  Then they go cruising in their golf carts.  My grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how.  Nobody there cooks. They just eat out.  And they eat the same thing every night: Early Birds.  Some of the people cant get past the man in the dollhouse to go out, so the ones who get out bring food back to the wrecked center and call it pot luck.  My Grandma says Grandpa worked all his life to earn his retardment and says I should work hard so I can be retarded one day, too.  When I earn my retardment I want to be the man in the dollhouse.  Then I will let people out so they can visit their grandchildren.

It's an official XtremeSport now.  here's a list of skiboarding  urlLink sites  - there don't seem to be too many good ones, most of them are homemade and cheesy.. actually most of them are duds, sorry.  must've been an old site & not maintained.  i wonder if it's become less popular since 1999 or so, it sounded from some of the sites like a bunch of people were crazy about it and it was supposed to be the next big thing. oh well.  (check out the  height  on the last pic  urlLink here .)

      //  you know what i'm  fighting  these days?  (besides my stubborn cough that won't go away..) cynicism.  i don't know what it is.. i had always thought it strange that people got so annoyed about little things or had that  attitude  about work politics or The System or whatever, you know what i mean.  but i guess lately with all kinds of things flying at me at work and feeling under the weather it's been easier for me to identify with that cynicism.  I don't know, i don't much feel like really getting into it here (is this already too much for a blog site?), but i will say  I MUST FIGHT IT.

       opening up a whole new can a gummy worms:  (this version comes with fresh dirt) ingrediants: 1 bag of Trolli gummy worms  1 packet of Oreos  1 large mason jar 1 big zippy lock bag 1 rolling pin 1 helpful + hungry friend  put Oreos in big zippy lock and seal properly, but not with a lot of air, cause that way the zippy might explode when you try to crush the Oreos...  bash the living bejujus out of the Oreos so that it resembles dirt. Put about 1" of "dirt" in the bottom of the mason jar and artistically layer gummi worms, repeat layers till about 1/2" from the top. Have helpful friend close the lid of jar tightly, blast some hip hop, salsa, reggae, or whatever pleases you and dance around hootin, shakin that jar.  voila! you have a whole new can a worms my friends, enjoy :)  gummy worms may be substituted with sour gummy worms, and oreos can be substituted with whatever dark cookie you can lay your grimy little paws on.

      so missed my monthly meeting today...  it was supposed to be the first thursday of the month, then it was pushed to this week, but somehow wednesday, and i so thought it was at 10.30, but apparently it was at 10... it was over by 10.25 when i was walking over, some peeps from my area was walking back, so really, meetings start like 10, 15 minutes after everyone gets there, so it probably lasted the full 10 minutes. the walk outside was nice and stimulating.  i am determined to walk the stairs to my office from now on, i am so unfit, and i want to get fit to snowboard!!! dennis, will you be my snow-buddy?

      i seriously crack myself up. blogging and having my own homepage has opened a whole 'nother can of gummy worms (oo, that would be a cool invention. frodo, can i get the stats on that? and now, who knows what "stats" really means? e.g., "i want the stats on smith." that's from a conversation with a coworker) ANYWAY. see? i crack myself up.  anytime you link someone to your site, you WILL peruse through that person's "friends" links. it's like you have to become acquainted with your friend's friends. so i have quietly said "hello" to dozens of people within the last few days. as in, "hello, i know ___. you know them too? maybe we should become friends?"   i also wonder: a) if i get most of my hits through this page b) if there are people who hit this page and don't know about inkspotted *gasp* c) which one people prefer. this or inkspotted? d) if i should just go blogger e) how in the world areeek found my site! :D which leads to the next question f) do we know half the people that read rofrodowhodo? youdotoo?  please feel free to answer the above. OH, i almost forgot. i would like to mention, very briefly and in passing, that JANE IS SCARING ME. these newly married women friends are out of control. "i highly recommend marriage" -- okeee, but there are a few steps before that. and why do our conversations have to center around the same topic? marriage and/or trying to find me someone. what happened to, "how are you doing?" is that too hackneyed/irrelevant? (fro, noah's ark complex) so i told her, "jane, why don't you stop harassing young singles and concentrate on producing an heir." without batting an eyelash, she jumped right into the next logical topic: babies.   dori, this after-work-hours entry was for you :)

      going back to the topic of utter and complete nerdiness: de, why must you be renaissance  whodo?  why can't you be satisfied with your water pipes? (ok, i can feel the beatdown, but i must continue) i guess it's strange for me that an engineer would "crave" such things. i do not profess to crave anything of your world. is this academic racism?   frodo, you must stay strong for us. if you go down, then london bridge goes down too. on recent headlines: i've concluded that brits and americans are funny, no doubt because our customs, language, history, etc. overlap. funny as in  so frivolous,  the way our newspapers holler about a certain actress's shoplifting activity and the way their papers can't stop covering royal scandals. MAN, i get so upset at today's journalists!?! they're making a mockery of the newspaper and what news is supposed to be. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. so frustrating, but it never deters me from wanting to be one. charles krauthammer, now he's the man. opinionated, but elegant, and he's got the facts straight.   roger, i just read your blogs. i completely agree. i thought about putting a disclaimer on my homepage, warning people that if they want to know the real me...well, it's just not going to happen through the internet. let's be honest, you can be whoever you want to be on the web. pretty? intelligent? witty? humane? polite! and i think most people know that, but it's very very easy to get sucked into an online journal and get deceived into thinking that  you really know this person.  on the other hand, at least on this page, we are the real thing :D haha, does that just nullify what i've said? rofrodowhodo truly speak their minds.  on iraq: "[L]et's be clear," Rice added. "This is a totalitarian regime. They know where everything is." i love condi!

      actually, Fart Proudly sounds like a book i'd like to own.   it's so true, nothing beats a nice edition of a good book, for any kind of gift (hint, hint;).  and it could be on anything and be interesting, if it's well written.  (as for space to keep all those books, i'd have to figure that one out some other time.)  I don't know, after college, i think my brain's been going through withdrawal or something: i feel like it just exploded.  this might be nerdy of me, but i've honestly been craving to learn about EVERYTHING, from  politics  (on which i am so so ignorant, as i've admitted) to  astronomy , to  world history  (again, ignoramus me) to  music theory  and the  fine arts .       ...Color theory and composition in painting.                                ........The OT and the ancient world.    i guess all those interests were always there, it's just that now i don't have a million other things i have to learn first, for a grade.   [do you feel the same way?  what do you honestly   crave to learn   about?]

      i love how we get out of church at 2,  but it gets dark at 3.30/4,  so it feels like 8,  so by the time it gets to 5,  it feels like 10.30,  and when you look at the clock expecting to need to go to bed soon,  but seeing that it's dinner time, and you still have a whole evening of weekend to enjoy,  love it :)  head cheese - saw it on a site that mentioned frito pie and all sorts of unmentionable "foods"...  headcheese - A jellied loaf or sausage made from chopped and boiled parts of the feet, head, and sometimes the tongue and heart of an animal, usually a hog.  courtesy of dictionary.com    yum... blech... and usually, i would eat anything... but thinking about the piggy head and stuff... hmmmNO I keep thinking there would be piggy hairs in it... ron, it tastes good?

      good morning. i thought i would get an early start since the office will be closed for veterans day :) i wanted to complete this assignment in the best way...so i went through my college files, researched on google, and plowed through my memory!    writers who influenced me     from the early years:  (when my appetite for reading was insatiable) e.b. white's  charlotte's web.    george orwell's  1984  and  animal farm.  louisa may alcott's  little women,  which i borrowed over and over from the public library. i'm still looking for that hardcover, illustrated version that i loved so much. frances hodgson burnett's  the secret garden  and  a little princess.  laura ingalls wilder's  little house  series. harper lee's  to kill a mockingbird.  roald dahl's  james and the giant peach.    from high-school:  oscar wilde's  the importance of being earnest.  john donne's  a valediction: forbidding mourning.  greek mythology. willa cather's  my antonia  and  death comes for the archbishop.  shakespeare, chaucer, the old old guys. f. scott fitzgerald's  the great gatsby.  j.d. salinger's  catcher in the rye.  chang-rae lee's  native speaker.  pearl s. buck's  the good earth.  and honestly, every history and english lit textbook that i read.    from college:  (fiction) herman melville's  bartleby the scrivener.  mark twain's  puddinhead wilson.  raymond carver's  where i'm calling from.  charles brockden brown's  wieland.  charles dickens's  a christmas carol.  washington irving's  rip van winkle.  (and this is where my love for literary nonfiction began) junichiro tanizaki's  in praise of shadows.  frank mccourt's  angela's ashes.  ted conover's  coyotes.  william finnegan's  cold new world.  vaclav havel's  living in truth.  our founding fathers.   and of all these authors, the four whose work i hold in the highest regard and have been the most influenced by are: george orwell ( homage to catalonia,    down and out in paris and london,  his essays on childhood), henry james ( washington square ), martin luther king, jr ( letter from birmingham jail ) and tracy kidder ( september ). i am in awe whenever i read their books or essays. and i think, writing must be one of God's most beautiful gifts. just look at the bible (and from there, jeremiah and hebrews are my favorites).

      everyone shop  Whole Foods tomorrow  (downtown Baltimore and Mt. Washington locations).  5% of the proceeds will go to the Baltimore Believe campaign.  Plus it's just a great store anyway.  //  took my bro out to Babalu for his birthday last night.  slightly overpriced i thought for the food, but it was cool.  they're very big on  plantains  there (is that a  cuban  thing?) - plantain chips, cooked plantain w/ my bro's lamb, cooked plantain with my shredded flank steak dish, and more plantain chips with our lime-y seafood appetizer.. (bro kept trying to call it plankton.)  plantains and  Ricky Ricardo .  very large black-and-whites of him and him with Lucy on the walls. Power Plant Live was loud, with music blaring from the bars at the north end.  I bet those places get  packed  on friday and saturday nights.   also saw a bit of umbc afterwards.  they've got a great new student union building with a great gameroom - plasma tvs everywhere (cable.. i miss cable), pool tables (cheap), arcade games (only 25c), foosball  ;)  and the outside is beautiful, with light spilling out of its tall glass walls into a large courtyard.   for some reason, everyone i saw was either african-american or asian (and my bro knew every single asian we passed of course)    [ i am absolutely getting  buried alive  in work.. help.. ]  the busier things get, the messier my area gets.  the messier my area gets the more i feel like  i'm losing my mind.  how i wish i could put everything on hold and do some serious reorganizing.

      going home at 3.30?!?! that's an outrage! isn't that illegal?  catching the end of Oprah? dear oh dear, we will have to do something about that...  I have something against all those mass-media-follow-the-leader peeps like martha and oprah, just kinda scary how many women would do it just cause they say so.   strange stalker man again? well, he hasn't done anything, maybe this is for real a case of misidentification. is there another big-eyed asian snow white called Dennis working for the city?

      hullo. felt weird going home at 3:30.  listened to a jeremy northam interview on npr.  (he's playing dean martin in a cbs movie this sunday evening.. maybe i'll remember to record it.) caught the last half of oprah on tv.  by the way, i didn't feel like mentioning this before but on tuesday or so the random emailer sent a third email, saying something about needing to ask me something, will i reply so he'd know the email "went threw".  uh-huh.   i only mention it now (i ignored it again of course) because walking to my car after orientation today a man and a woman were in a car turning the corner where i was waiting to cross.  the woman (passenger)'s window rolls down and the guy leans over to say to me, "hey, i'll email you!"  what the..?  there's no one next to me, he must've been talking to me.  it was only about 3:30, so i wouldn't expect a city employee to be driving around outside ... i don't know, it may not even be related.   don't worry, i'm actually not really bothered by it all. yet.  thoroughly confused and slightly curious, yes.  maybe one of you can make something out of all this.  i never was too good at solving mysteries.  by the way, i was carrying all my information from the seminar in a plastic bag that said in big letters "MECU" (municipal employees credit union), and "www.mecu.com" (or something like that) on it.  I don't know if that's a relevant clue or not...

      good morning, Ms.  elf .  (are you going to correct your math or will i have to?)  this week has been weird and strangely Bean-less.  in the few months she'd been riding with me to work and back i had gotten used to her company.  she was always the one who pulled my parking permit out for me when we parked in the morning, and i didn't realize it but she had become the reason i made sure to leave work on time - so she wouldn't be kept waiting.   these days i'm just hoping my my car doesn't get towed (i keep forgetting to display that thing), and leaving work later and later.  oh jeanbean...

      yo, buy ME a segway  :)  on the market this march eh?   How cool is that.  HEY,  I wanna visit the factory too.    I heard there's all kinds of segway rip offs in the pipeline  -      3-wheeled electric scooters and whatnot.   oh, fro.. for some reason certain pet stories come to mind - how when owners go on vacation and come back they find out how much their pet missed them cuz of the "presents" they find in their shoes or on their beds, and other mischief...  (i'm not neglecting you hon, i've been kept away)  As for my love of  words .. i dunno, my brain's drained and i can't think of a single word i treasure or am intrigued by..   i will have to get back to this assignment...

We're pretty sure we have two of them now - the dark chocolate brown one i told you about and a tiny gray one my roomies were describing..  It's bad having mice running around our place but i don't know if it's any better to have dead or suffering ones that I'd have to do something with..!  eeeeek.

      hair -  each piece of hair has history in each follicle changing color and strength with my joys and glooms tamed golden brown with the summer sun  and pools and ice pops dark lustre chocolate hidden in hats, under scarfs my hair tells my story in the little kinks and frays cutting it off is shaving away memories of  sisters laughing at the pool frost tipped breath smokey days and sometimes i am glad of it anticipating so much more to come.

      oh don't get me wrong de, I have a whole ton of stuff that I just don't use... (do can testify to that)  I am a sucker for the new hyped up thing, but the 3 things I listed are my basic necessities, I am no minimalist, i wish... so does dori, she keeps making me throw out my really old stuff, or stuff that I just don't use.  not so very impressive I'm afraid...

      that's awesome, you minimalist you.   head-to-toe wash to clean yourself with  and vaseline to moisturize.   Impressive.  //  I must say, there are some cravings that only  samgyupsal  (that korean grilled pork thing we ate) or  yookkaejang  (a SPICY soup of cut beef, scallions and vermicelli in a red-orange broth) can quench.  And I had both this weekend   :)   happy me.  (HanAhReum's yookkaejang was surprisingly good. must recommend.  Although to eat there you literally have to fight for a seat.)

      (as i write, a load of STUFF is coming into my inbox... boohoo, must post quickly..)  i was putting on my night-a-mins (Origins, it's this great nighttime moisturizer) and thinking how there are some  products  i think i'll be buying for the rest of my life.  Night a mins i think has just become one of them.  It works well, feels good, smells WONDERFUL (like citrus fruits and fragrant roots i forget the names of).  Yum. Another one (sorry this list is so girly and cosmetics-oriented) is this great hair treatment thing, from Bain de Terre.  It's the only thing i ever put in my hair (most days i forget to use it, but on days like when i actually blow-dry my hair it makes it nice and smooth and straight and shiny).  I don't know what's in it, but it's kind of just like this magic oil.  Like putting a few drops of (clean) oil in your hair where you need it.. sounds gross? well, it's great.  $14 at salons for this tiny maybe 2-oz. bottle but it's lasted me forever and proven to be more than worth it. hm, what else?  Nads (but shh, i didn't say it)...    OK, this is kind of girly and frivolous, but i want to hear about your discoveries..!  maybe i shouldn't have put it as an assignment, it's kind of hard to remember stuff like this on the spot.  Last time I went to visit my mom, she had this big fat hoola hoop sitting next to her bed.  "WHAT is THAT?" I asked.  And she showed me.   It was HILARIOUS watching my mom hoola-hoop (and she was GOOD!).  As I cracked up and rolled on the floor and pounded the bed, she was saying how great an exercise it was and that the bumps (the inside's not smooth, it's lined with big bumps) kind of massage? help tone? your abs.   Anyway, I tried after she was done, and wasn't half as good, and the bumps kind of hurt (my abs have not been exercised or toned in like forever).

       Gil Shaham  ROCKS.  Listened to a cd on the drive to fairfax that made the time whiz by..  mom and I shopped at the brand new neighborhood  Super H  ( H anAhReum, supersized).  They had this crazy  PPungTueGee  machine (you know those big crispy pancake-looking rice crackers):  every three seconds a few grains would fall into a funnel and PPUNG!!! [loud explosion] - out popped a big round cracker.  still warm from the explosion and very yummy.  The woman also sold fresh  Gim  (roasted seaweed sheets) off a Gim machine, and Peanut Butter  Ojinguh  (squid), whatever that is.    thursday with mom and bro:   early rise for  eighteen holes in forty-degree weather .   great time (except that afterwards it felt like the skin on both hands had been peeled off).   dinner with the relatives.  korean hymns, psalm 118.  turkey and ham and all kinds of korean food.  my funny little baby cousin (who talks now!  but refuses to play with me), a videogamefest upstairs, and a camera-happy uncle.  good-natured hints that ( how old are you? twenty-three ?) yes, twenty-three is a "good" age... the "right" age...    today, all is quiet.  no one online, quiet at work, even the streets are barren.

      okay, got back from the dentist... I cannot stand going to the dentist, it's absolutely awful!!! i need a root-canal -> i knocked part of my 2 front teeth out when I was 7, so one of the roots of the front teeth is weak from being chipped, so they said it's preventative root-canal, to make it stronger and all. It doesn't feel like there is anything wrong with it, but I don't want my teeth to fall out later... They make it sound like it's the nice cousin of the mean root-canal, like that is possible - a wolf in a lamb's skin i say...  I'm soooo scared!!! I don't want to lose my front teeth, can you imagine? ugh!!! please don't, even the thought is embarrassing...  boo hoo hoo...

      So i completely ran out of checks the first week of this month right, and had to reorder.  i'm still waiting for them to come.   meanwhile, i've learned to use  money orders . It's been so long since i've had more than sixty dollars of cash on me at any one time.  i didn't know how money orders worked but they only take cash.  I was so nervous and felt so garshdern  vulnerable  withdrawing huge stacks of cash from my neighborhood atm (at the ghetto corner exxon -- i didn't even think atms let you withdraw that much at one time, but they do), carrying it all around with me, and handing it all over at the Superfresh (i remembered they sold money orders there) for a little slip of paper.  aiye yayaie.  i felt like a prime hold-up target...and/or a drug dealer.  over $600 in money orders in the past two days. thank goodness for checks, i hope mine come soon.

      everytime lhf gathers together for an event, i'm so amazed and astonished at just how good God has been to us. especially last night, as everyone was sharing, my oh my, i was just a big ball of choked up emotions..    psalm 89:1-2   I will sing of the Lord's great love foreverl with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.  I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you established your faithfulness in heaven itself.

      no, it's a movie about this computer programmer dude and cubicles and bosses and staplers.  by the guy who made beavis & b-h (boo).  had some crude language but was pretty funny.  Fitting film to watch on my day off from work eh.  My dog of choice is a cat.  a friendly clean, unslobbery,  un selfish cat  (they do exist).  Or a young parakeet i could train. Ok ok.  I like the  urlLink Shih tsu .  But not with the long flowing hair and NO BOWS.   urlLink  Adorable   with short hair.  sounds like they need mucho pampering though, which i'm probably not the type to do - i barely groom myself..

      no I didn't stay too too late, just till 4.30 when I just couldn't stand it anymore. i wanted to go play in the snow the whole day, but by the time I got home, I wound myself up so much that I just fell asleep on the couch for a couple of hours.  I think I was behaving strangely after I woke up and scared dori and esthie teehee... the curry and the powder iced tea and sour skittles sure didn't help ;P I don't have a laptop yet, mr. dubya was supposed to be watching out for deals for me, but I think he has forgotten. methinks it is high time I shall terrorize him about it!! macs aye, it's some costly piece of equipment. I'm going with Dell, if I ever get around to getting one that is!!! what is Officespace? is it like trading spaces or is it some nasty daytime soap?

      hey. hope you didn't end up staying too long yesterday, fro?  it was liberal leave for me so i had to use Personal leave time but stayed home anyway and watched OfficeSpace.   finally went out to the MALL when we couldn't stand being inside any more (half the stores were closed and it was nice and empty).  then came home and made Chili, "smoked" and "chunky" (don't ask).  i've been seriously considering getting the 14" iBook.  I decided i didn't need anything  too  beefy (as tempting as it is to just pay a little more to keep upgrading, etc til i'm shelling out $3k..).  And I think I do like macs.  As for the money, it may take me a while to save, but i've been feeling kinda claustrophobic not having a  real  computer of my own. by the way, did you ever buy a laptop fro?

       on dogs    urlLink an inaccurate guide  to your suitable doggy mate  I never gave thought to which breed of dog I would really want if I had the chance to choose for myself. My sister was the dog buff in the family, and she loves dalmations, so we have a dal. I had always wanted a big dog, so I thought I would like great danes, but their faces are just not cuddly-like. I also wanted a dog who loves the water. Our dal is all trepidation when it comes to water, time and time again, I am in the water tempting him to join me, ending up being all wet like an idiot splashing around, while he looks at me quizically on land, as if he were saying, "what are you nuts?" I have found my dog of choice,  urlLink the Newfoundland  - a water dog, cuddly and big, who unfortunately slobbers, but I can live with that :)   urlLink pictures of newfs   epitaph to one sadly departed Newfoundland by Lord Byron:   Near this spot are deposited the remains of one who possessed beauty without vanity strength without insolence courage without ferocity and all the virtues of man without his vices. This praise which would be unmeaning flattery if inscribed over human ashes is but a just tribute to the memory of Boatswain, a dog who was born at Newfoundland, May 1803, and died at Newstead Abbey, November 18, 1808.

      Well, until i can get my live update and run the Norton scan again, i will just assume i'm virus-free.  which is probably true. but SOME LHF-er (with Outlook) sure is causing quite an epidemic.  {nobody open attachments to any random-looking email, even from people you know!}  // By the way, I may take  urlLink  figure skating   lessons, with elway.. just for kicks.  Pretty good deal, apart from buying the skates.

I was all stressing out and when i got to work did the Norton LiveUpdate and Scan Computer for Viruses but nothing turned up in the scan.. does that mean that i'm actually virus-free??   [Must go to Brother blog and ask Mr. Brain.  i wish i knew more about these things, i'm confused and getting all stressed..  I went ahead and deleted ALL my addressbook entries :(  ]  lunch with do:   a piece of subway turkey sub, one JUMBO shrimp, two seedless mandarin oranges from Wholefoods, broiled salmon, a samosa from Bombay Grill, cup of crab soup, seafood quesadilla, and a can of Sierra Mist.

      woohoo Downtown Dollar Day!! I must confess, I very much want to go to the Visionary as well as the MD Science Center (they have a very alluring exhibit on bodily functions going on right now) I am torn...  mr. boing is mr. boing because... it makes me happy :) "boing" is such a happy noise, like bouncing off something. it is an invincible noise, I like it.   fro's tacky choices of car accessories include: hula girl noddy head dog they sell on the side of streets fuzzy dice  I don't do the smellies, or the overly moshimoro thingies. I like tacky things that are just too cool, like how red jello is so very cool but not so very sophisticated. hula girl is my decoration of choice, not the ugly plasticky things, but the old skool lookie likie ones playing the yukelele with nice hair and a real plastic stringy skirt. I love tack, what can I say?

       assignment 12.  i have to confess that i don't like wiggly, jiggly, jingling things on my dash.  i don't like scents and scented doodads hanging from my rear-view mirror.  (after car washes i let them do a citrus scent though & it smells yummy) i have that  Tempo  thing on my passenger flip-down visor that everyone with long torsos bumps their heads on (it's like a flat kleenex dispenser for napkins), and  WetOnes  for wiping off fast food grease & ketchup.  there's a  disposable camera  in my glove compartment (for when you're on the road and see something you really want a picture of -- i've pulled over three times for clouds/sunsets so far; or for car accidents i suppose).  and finally, ghetto " seat covers " (pieces of cloth) in my trunk, for my seats that get burning hot in the summer when the sun hits the leather.   All in all, kind of  old man ish, huh?  But that's ok, that's why mr. ralphie is mr. ralphie.

      I'm glad to say that my mr. boing (my car) is very very gas efficient, he doesn't react to me trying to make him go at all, so mr. boing and granny me, we never venture into the left lane. we drove from NJ back to B-more on 1/2 a tank or so, that's not bad right? I'm learning a lot about cars nowadays, Esthie told me I have to check the pressure(?) of the wheels every month, so far, they have passed the fro's very professional kick test, but Esthie and I will venture to check them wheels soon.   currently, mr. boing has the following accessories: tissue, wet wipes, windex wipes, strange cha-knees tape my dad left behind, funky fro musique, a navy club... he is still missing a hula girl.

      // i am such a candy addict.  currently in my desk drawer i have a 1/2 pound box of Mike & Ikes which i am happily munching away on.  it's all about original fruit flavors, chewy or hard (but chewy's better).. lime, orange, cherry (and even lemon), sour apple, grape.  or sour fruits... SourPatch Kids.  mmm.  // you know Bill Maher, from  Politically Incorrect ?  I was at Borders and started reading his  urlLink new book  "When you ride alone, you ride with bin Laden."  One reviewer said, "Maher is both an idiot & a genius. Buy the book anyway,"  which i have to say is pretty on-the-mark.. but he's also  hilarious .  I couldn't help myself from cracking up out loud like a fool, sitting there on the couches in the Art section.  Anyway, one thing that stuck out was how americans really aren't informed enough about the importance of  reducing our dependence on foreign oil , and it's really made me think twice about wasting gas.  [read this  urlLink  LINK  ]  I feel kinda bad about the gas-guzzler that my car is too.  My next car will definitely be a hybrid. [...sorry, that was pretty random &  un -dodefro-esque.  but i read stuff and it jiggles around in my head and i've gotta get it out  :)  ]

      4 days straight of holiday, man, it was something else, felt really good to get away from work, but is such a pain to get back into the groove. Thanksgiving at M&G's was absolutely fantastic, Taboo helped our digestion, and movie afterwards: the Rookie (it was not that bad... you know, we're all in a thanksgiving, lethargic sort of mood, cheesy Disney flicks are just the cherry that tops off the sundae)  all in all, it was good to get away from work. Now I have to add renewed zest into work until Christmas time yay!!! by the way, my credit cards are about to melt... Christmas presents looms in the not very far distant.  still have to crank up some creative juices and make some spectacular prezzies. we shall see, we shall see...

      Lunch, at a cute ma & pa restaurant off Patapsco Ave: a round of Cokes, crab soups, oyster sandwiches and my whiting sandwich.   The three of us probably made an odd-looking group: my tallish white fifties mentor-of-sorts, the forties chinese consultant guy, and me (the korean-american youngun.  ok, yeah, sometimes if i think about it in meetings or whatever, i feel very out of place).  Anyway, the food was good, and it was actually kind of fun.  at one point we were talking about the Ravens and sports and stadiums, and the Consultant mentioned that if we were into baseball, his firm had these great season seats at Camden Yards...    The Afternoon: One of my projects is over at the Eastern Avenue Pumping Station (the historic building next to the Harbor Marriott that houses the Museum of Public Works).  My contact person there is the cutest old man - he kept showing me albums and albums of black & whites dating back to like 1914.  Proud Papa of a Pumping Station..  I left before the newsmen came with their cameras: they were supposed to give an interview there with my Bureau Head or someone.  ..wow, and it's already time to go home.  getting out of the office is great  :)

      Do you ever get the sneaking suspicion that the "Close Door" button on elevators isn't actually  wired  to anything?  I bet it's a huge conspiracy - it's just this dummy button that they install to give us passengers a false sense of control.  I've never once seen the door actually close any faster because someone pushed "close door."   Iceberg Lettuce  should be banned from food service use.  Technically it shouldn't even qualify as food.  [As I write, I'm having a heck of a time trying to fish out the real bits of food from the crunchy white trash in my Q''''o's Chicken Salad.] It wouldn't have to mean all the Iceberg Lettuce farmers would go bankrupt-- I'm sure there's other uses for it.. I could see it being remarketed as the new, ideal packing peanuts - cheap, non-toxic, biofriendly...?  aiye.  I'm in a strange mood.  I do so wish it were friday today...

So i guess i really don't  have  to take any days off.  But that's too weird.  I'll take at least the 24th i guess.  i was thinking it would be great to go on a little day trip with my family or something but my mommy got hurt (putting up christmas lights by herself!) :*(  - nothing too serious though.

      I want one!! but can't...  I was just going to share about my Icebreakers power trip experience. I opened my Ice Breakers can to reach for a mint just now, you know, the round tin kind that has a plastic flappy lid that snaps shut? the force of opening the snappy lid caused the remnant (cause i am a mint fiend and pop mints nonstop all day) mints to shudder. the Ice breaker mints if you are familiar with them are shaped like little pills, but are curved in a satisfying manner towards the center, so they were wobbling in there looking like they were shuddering. here is my power trip, this is me -> " Ha ha, I am the giant traumatizing the little mint community, which mint shall be eaten this time!?!" all the while, the mints are shuddering in fear. (or shuddering in laughter at my insane imagination ;p)

      my favorite is  urlLink linus  he is so smart and cute, but I hate lucy!!! she's so mean!  i was just looking around the site you linked woodstock to de, and I found out I didn't know that Lucy and Linus had a little brother called Rerun, or that Sally is younger than Linus, I thought they were the same year, and that Lucy and Charlie Brown were the same year... I also thought Peppermint Patty and Marcie were the same year... (they are right? cause they sit in the same classroom?!?!)... it is all a mystery to me...

      yo, i heard you were going to some driving class tonight right?  be careful.  it was just like driving in rain this morning (after i broke the layer of ice off all my windows - my car had turned into a popsicle overnight).. i didn't notice any icy spots when i stayed on the big roads.  Is someone going with you?  Actually it shouldn't be too bad, i don't think temperatures will be below freezing yet.

      ...thoroughly bored and insanely busy at the same time.  (yes that is very possible)...  // You know, i walked the extra block in the *bitter* cold to Gina's for lunch today, and it was well worth it.  i'd gotten into the habit of going to the  other  New York style salad bar ( you know: korean owned buffet with hot american/chinese food, "sushi", korean  banchan , and assorted fruits, veggies and salads, sold by weight ).  That one's actually cleaner and newer than Gina's but the food just isn't the same.  Anyway, if you're ever downtown for lunch M-F Gina's is the place to go.

      mm, yum.  we should have a day to cook & bake up  un common goodies.. french pastries, souffles, crumpets.. and we could buy some of those great farmers market fruit spreads, and gourmet cheeses.  A deli down the street from here sells dozens of different horseradishes and mustards.  And we could buy some of those great olives from the Frommagerie, fro!  Actually we (my house)  have  been meaning to have a Cheese Party ...  fun fun.

      ro is right,  crumpets are not scones, sorry about that...   urlLink  crumpets    [KRUHM-piht] Hailing from the British Isles, crumpets are small, yeast-raised breads about the size of an English muffin. The unsweetened batter is poured into special crumpet rings  (which have been arranged on a griddle), then "baked" on stovetop. The finished crumpet has a smooth, brown bottom and a top riddled with tiny holes. Crumpets are toasted whole (unlike ENGLISH MUFFINS, which are split) and spread with butter and jam, as desired.    English muffin  This round, rather flat (about 3 inches in diameter by 1 inch high) "muffin" is made from a soft yeast dough that, after being formed into rounds, is baked on a griddle. It can be made at home but is readily available commercially in an assortment of flavors including sourdough, whole wheat, raisin, cinnamon and cornmeal. English muffins are halved before toasting. In order to produce a surface with the proper peaks and craters (which adds to their crunchy texture and provides plentiful pockets for butter and jam), English muffins must be fork-split and gently pulled apart. Using a knife to cut them in half will not produce the desired result.    scone  [SKOHN; SKON] This Scottish QUICK BREAD is said to have taken its name from the Stone of Destiny (or Scone), the place where Scottish kings were once crowned. The original triangular-shaped scone was made with oats and griddle-baked. Today's versions are more often flour-based and baked in the oven. They come in various shapes including triangles, rounds, squares and diamonds. Scones can be savory or sweet and are usually eaten for breakfast or tea.   biscuit  [BIHS-kiht] 1. In America, biscuits refer to small QUICK BREADS, which often use LEAVENERS like baking powder or baking soda. Biscuits are generally savory (but can be sweet), and the texture should be tender and light. 2. In the British Isles, the term "biscuit" usually refers to a flat, thin cookie or cracker. 3. The word biscuit comes from the French bis cuit  ("twice cooked"), which is what the original sea biscuits aboard ship had to be in order to remain crisp.

      enough enough!! my defense for LOTR2 -  the whole movie was filmed as one whole big thing. with the vast scope of the book and the entire anthropology of different characters Tolkien created, it was next to impossible to give justice to the whole book and each creature. i heard that they had to cut out a ton of stuff already, so let's watch the directer's cut before we really criticize.  (i do have beef with the story changes they made with the elks, the Rohanian war and so on...)  ... i think i was just disappointed cause it wasn't what i thought it would be, not even that the first one was so great, but it just didn't satisfy what i had created in my head while reading the books. but i still love it! (can i stress that more?)   I LOVE LOTR's  p.s.  whodo!!! read the book!!!

       LOTR-2  OK.  I wasn't going to get into specifics, but.. [** STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!] The beef i had was: -  The pacing.  It was  distractingly off  in many places.  In a few scenes i was just like, hello, there's an army of 10,000 killers right outside the door, where is there time to be talking so slowly and just  being cool ? - The way the editing was done, there wasn't much  progression  or a real  climax  either.  The beginning was SO dark and evil (almost too real, it was very well done) and everything seemed so hopeless, but the resolution (the ending) just wasn't done well enough, that it seemed like too much of a cop out: it's like, *bling,* the elves show up, and *bling,* the big tree people show up, and *woah* where did that dam come from ? -- positioned in the perfect place and with enough water to flush out all the bad guys.  - and lastly, the comic relief was kind of random (gollum was a bit overdone, no? and gimli's character was reduced to being there  only  for that purpose.)   ok, if I sound all cynical and harsh, sorry.  And it sounds like i'm ripping it to shreds, when it really wasn't  bad  - it's probably just that i went in with  big  expectations  (LOTR1 was SO well done!!)   Also, I'm sure it's a very different experience for those who've read the books and know all the background and all kinds of details than for someone like me who {*gasp*} haven't read them.  But anyway, a movie should stand on its own.   ...We were saying how 1 and 3 will probably be best, and 2 is kind of the middle filler.  btw, i wonder if the same group of people did the editing for 1 as for 2..?  does anyone know? **and oh yeah, i don't have to even say that all the special effects were totally AMAZING.  They were the best part..

      shorry... sick yesterday and went home. it felt  soooo goood  to take the day off, I just schlept and schlept and schlept... hmm hmm good :) i have a throbbing headache on the right side of my head behind my eye, boom boom boom... blah ;o ... LOTR2 feels like the seams to a really pretty garment, unfortunately, the seams are just not as pretty as other parts of the garment, know what I mean? it still was darn good, but compared to the 1st one... well, it's just a little scatty like. I still love LOTR though. ... family traits ?!?! hmmm... we are all stubborn, we are all uber-sensitive, so we all argue a lot. my mom and my dad are such different people, I have no idea how they got together in the first place.  my dad is a couch po-tay-toe, and my mom wakes up at 4.30 to walk the dogs.  we (my sister, my bro and i) we're couch pototoes at heart, so we like lounging and eating, funny thing is, we're all pretty much kinda athletic when we need to be. we were all on the swim team, track, all sorts of stuff like that... but then we were all groomed and grown under the asian mentality of putting your children in all the classes under the sun, so i went to ballet, math tutoring, piano, violin, swimming, riding (horses that is), tennis, painting, countless countless things... one thing about the ho family, we all love to eat. we know our foods, and just let me tell you, we like to eat  well .  we also love travelling in a big circus fashion, and we travel to bask in the sun and to eat good food. we have restaurant guides of most major cities on this planet, my dad even suggested going to India for curry and would have went if it were not for the political unrest in all the neighbouring countries. we're funny like that, we would do all sorts of crazy things for food. we also love boardgames, and trash talking during boardgames, so i do that a lot...  all our weekends are spent at the pool and when it's winter, we go to an indoor pool, we're all chlorine heads, but now that we have dogs, we do much less of that. I grew up eating chicken drumsticks next to the slippy slide at the country club pool, (yes I'm a brat, what can i say?) and playing table tennis or badminton on the grass.  my bro and i are the most similar, we're both big babies and I can practically read his mind, which freaks him out (i really enjoy it). (he's 9 years my junior btw, he's my own little punk :p) that's all for now, i think i was just rambling on about what we do, I don't know if these things qualify as traits or not, but there are 5 of us altogether, so it's hard to have traits... we're all wierd and different.

      herro ebreebodee.   assignment 18.  ok, where to start.  My family's very funny.  No, really.   The thing i was thinking about that got me even started on this was, when we were growing up, i guess partly because of the korean-english language barrier, i could never expect anything i said to my mom to be heard and understood the first time.  It would take 2 or 3 times.  Every single thing I said.   But my mom's english is actually pretty fluent.  Most of the reason is the  family trait  of a.d.d.-like zoning out.  Total Immersion in deeep thoughts.  My brother's the same way.  I'll ask him a direct, simple question.  He'll just sit there for like a minute, i'll repeat myself (and be more direct if possible), and  then  he'll sort of start, shake off his thoughts, and look around a little... "Oh! huh? what?"  and then if i'm lucky he'll answer me.  (If this sounds like it might get frustrating after a while, it is.. sometimes it got so ridiculous i just had to laugh.  Of course, this is just their default state - they do have times of normal alertness and all, and it's a great treat to be engaged in conversation with them in those times.) Have  I  inherited it?  Um, yeah i'll confess to being more-than-average zone-out-ish.  And I do love those times alone to just think.  But yo, not like that.  Not quite the way mom and bro do it.  There's some intense daydreaming power running in my family...  maybe it could be used for something?  powering the house ?...   :P  Something my bro and i share, which is pretty surprising for him, considering his personality - is a tendency to be super thorough.  In anything he cares about, he'll stress over it and chew his thumb cuticle (which i do!  and my mom too, when we get nervous that's our telltale sign).  I've been learning to be more of a broad brush-stroker with some things..  I guess just with the coming time off with family and all, I was just thinking about these things, and wondering about your families. So...any quirky family traits  pour vous ?  {c'mon, fess up ;P}

      Ok.  to explain this next assignment (which i won't get to til tomorrow..) -  it might be kind of hard to look at yourself objectively (as it always is) - but i was thinking about my family and how it was for me growing up.  there's no denying that a lot of my personality and how i interact with others has been shaped by my upbringing.  Like i said, i'll get into it when i have a chance tomorrow, but some things are so very Koh, it's kind of scary & funny..

      oh you increased the left... can we decrease the right instead?  ... hey looks better!! go whodo, go whodo! p.s. which thing did you change? I couldn't figure it out... ... oh good, you shrank the font too, i was thinking of that, but didn't know if it would come up too small + decided I was messing on this way too much so went back to work :) excuses, excuses ;p oh... i thought you shrank the font...

      i increased the left margin but that's kind of weird too huh?  what do you think, better or worse? SOMEhow, decreasing the right doesn't seem to do anything. ... There was something called "padding" which i increased for the body.  I'm also playing with font size.  Did you like the bigger font?..

      yo i was about to kill the archives.  i was going nuts trying to get it to show posts after october something.  Hopefully with a fresh template it might work better?  let's see.. HOW COME "ARCHIVES" ON THIS PAGE ISN'T EVEN A HYPERLINK ?  (All i know how to do is click on Republish All under the archives button..what's going on here??) Can you cut and paste that section from our old template so it points to the archives url?

      Thanks, girl.  I LOVE this template!!  :)   :)   :)  ... {= the feeling of stepping out onto freshly fallen snow} I was getting so tired of the old butter page.  You've really been going NUTS with the crocheting huh?  I was waiting for your crochet busting-out to happen like a year ago when you were learning, I knew you'd get into it.  Yeah, it's great being able to just pump stuff out, even if it  is  all hole-y.

      hiya, know what you mean about hurting being awake... i usually wake up when Comf calls at 7 or so to be let in, but this morning she had to wait outside and call 2x before I woke up... sorry comfort! ooh... christmas cards... you know what the best kind of christmas card is, the one that has a piece of chocolate inside... (teehee :) ) does mine have chocolate in it? (just messing with you ;p) I stayed up late and made a crochet worm/ mouse/ elephant creature who is handicapped cause i ran out of yarn, so it has only 1 leg.  it started out as a weiner dog, but since I was using pink yarn, it just didn't look quite right, so it became just a thing... it's my own little mutant. (doris says it looks like the flying dog in Neverending Story...) i should patent it, it will be the next tickle me elmo, muhahaha... ahem.

      we should buy tickets to see two towers! wednesday's probably out since we all have prayer meeting and since it's opening night, it'll be like a madhouse, but you girls up for it on thursday night?  maybe?    *****  AVAM was a little too, hmmm.., demonic for me i guess. it just made me really sad to see how such amazing talent was being used in such a horrible way. but yeah, dennis, i agree with you, that buck was definitely worth it.  i'm kinda sad that we missed the aquarium though. maybe they'll have another dollar day around the corner. i can't believe that i'll be leaving for korea in a couple more days! back to the motherland. well, not really, but you know what i mean. a land abundant of kim-chi and dduk-bok-ki stands. YUM.  fro, promise me that if i start to balloon out from eating too much, you'll let me know gently but firmly ;)

      Last night, try  as hard  as i might, i could  not  fall asleep.  and i'm not the insomniac type.  I had had 2 cups of La Madeleine coffee but that was early afternoon.  I just couldn't stop thinking of the long list of things i had to do / wanted to do, all in the next 10 days.  Cards, shopping, wrapping, baking? ( why didn't i take care of all this before? ).  The vicious 2-week cycles at work (my pain-in-the-buns responsibility) isn't slowing down for the holidays either - the mayor's office has no mercy i tell you, i can't possibly take much time off and still get my job done.   Ai-ya, is it friday yet??

       friday  weekend started early cause boss left @ 2.45 or so.   mission lunacy  help hor-hay steal boris's car so that he could put in stereo system (aw, how sweet, ok enough already!) 14.00 torrential rain. hh arrived w/ sherwin in tow, i abandom them in lot to install stereo in rice rocket and kick back in apt for 1/2 hr.  14.30 watched s + hh struggle w/ nuts and bolts to no avail, plan A failed, moving to plan B... 15.00 lent hh keys, planned the great switcheroo, replacing boris's car w/ his while he takes it to Best Buy. I am to make highly dangerous phone call @ 22.00 to check up on how the plans have proceeded. 15.10 back in office, boris calls... nearly gave everything away :p talked and talked and talked 17.00 returned home 17.30 boris suggests going to Towson, I insist on driving 21.35 returned home screaming as I reached where her car used to be (where hh's car was) succesfully distracted boris. 21.50 mysterious phone call which boris picked up, had to check myself to rip it out of her hands. mystery caller hung up 21.51 called hh immediately (it was him just now, he has accomplished the great switcheroo) 21.55 "took out trash" and went to lot to seal the deal on the great mission :D   saturday  7.00 woke up late to go to morning prayer 7.15 boris was happily surprised by strange stereo system in car 8.45 I drag esthie to MVA attempting to transfer my license 9.05 failed law test :(  try again next week, next time  study first!  9.30 AVAM with boris and dennis 11.00 left boris for hor-hay on street corner 11.20 lunch at WholeFoods 13.30 MD Science Center - Grossology (smelling gross smells, making rude noises) 15.30 walked around Fed Hill craving houses we cannot afford 16.20 got ticket on dennis's puff daddy car (sad sad, Hopkins graduates cannot tell time...) 17.45 babysitting (i love the babies in our church :) ) 22.45 dead tired... ate pizza and slept zzz   sunday  children's dedication service, elisha is a diva! God's precious precious gifts to us. crocheted scarf (finished in 1 day, crazy stuff, crocheting...) otherwise non-eventful until I attempted parallel parking all over town. went to brother's house (quiet street w/ parallel parking opportunities) asked esthie to ask ang to come out and help me if possible, esthie invited the whole house + the staash to watch me attempt not to scratch up drew's car and not slam into the bmw behind me... the crew cheered uproarously when I kinda succeeded... thanks guys (people watching me makes me nervous... hence I confuse the pedals, not good...) there was lots of screaming (from me) and a lot of encouraging (from them) Good thing Staash was there, giving me tips since she took the test in MD. got home later (alive, thank God) played scrabble w/ Yan Po + boris (they gang up man... ripped me up! ;p) it was fun  watched esthie bake 4 dozen cookies ( no kidding! )  went to bed   all in all, it was very satisfying.

       urlLink selling dreams by the bagful  is it a surprise goodie bag? it just seems a little too personal... like wearing someone else's pajamas to bed...  I used to think one needed angst to produce quality and unique art.  This is not true  ...angst in my understanding is misguided passion... but unfortunately, it seems like (through AVAM) a lot of artists do believe it is necessary to live destructively to construct art. All i could think of was, what wasted talent, what waste...

      AVAM.  Survey says: (a.) strange, grotesque, and disturbing  (b.) interesting but depressing  (c.) mucho talent but sadly misdirected  (d.) worth the buck we paid to see it.   Over all, it made me sad thinking about a whole subculture of addiction and violence that i guess i don't normally think about.  So many of the artists had such tough lives, and it reflects out in their work.

      boardgames and memories  monopoly  - me in fobby pj's hoarding the mullah. i grew up playing chinese monopoly of course! chinese checkers - i played by myself, trying to find the jump with the most combinations... yes, my sister wouldn't play with me  risk  - my dad always wooped our butts with this game, not like he doesn't in all the other games. he's so smart, where did all the smart go with us kids?  catch phrase  - sitting by the road of Hop House playing for like 3 hourse straight, memorizing the cards practically, waiting for the U-haul to move the Schmitz to NC.  hotel  - my brothers favorite game last summer, he made us play it again and again. I like to buy the most ghetto hotels and make people cringe when they have to pay me.  i don't really have a favorite, but  scrabble  comes close. i suck at it, always making stupid words like zit and so forth, but it's a kind game, well at least how we play it in the apartment where points don't count, and all you're trying to do is make the craziest longest word you can :) the good company helps too.

      How's about we check out HanAhReum first and if they don't have a good set for not too expensive then we can make our own?  Which I was thinking about too actually, but like i said, that lens shape is so much nicer to play with than the squished sphere that our bead/pellet things are.   I suppose for us little leaguers the beads are good enough - or at least worth saving like $50..?   and  fun , of course :)

      i have some clear glass pellet things from some wedding or bridal shower. you have some blue ones at home right? maybe that would work. is there a home depot we can stop by? or maybe we can use plexi glass, so it will be all space age and cool... or did you want to go for a classic look?   woohoo fish and fighting! we're so wierd and geeky...  i don't think it matters how many stones each as long as there is about more than enough for the whole board for each player. when we were little and played at playing Go, we would lose so many, but there was always enough after, so i think more is good...

      19x19 board (but how many stones each ?) Yeah, i could make my own and it would be all unique and cool, but if the stones aren't the right shape it can get a little annoying.       Hey, so you wanna go for it tonight?  HanAhReum --> beef up our brains with fish --> crush each other in war of great minds.  haha, or  something  like that.

      * i was  not  considering, i was going to ignore them, but they sent me an info packet, so i just feel it is courteous to tell them i'm not interested anymore. * photography   idea:  make your own Go set ~ get those glass pellets (we have so much from the weddings) and paint a wooden board. (is that for real too ghetto?)  I'll cook some fish with you! I can make it Cha-knees style, steamed or fried, up to you! we can go to Hanna-rheum to buy the feesh, and stop by walmart to get the Go set, or were you going to go all out and get a real nice set?  fish - good for the brains (and complexion) so my mom told me Go - shows the lack of brains  it's a good combo, let's make it a night! (can't believe it's friday!) all work weeks should be 2 days long :)

      * You were still considering AVAM?  hm, it couldn't have been too healthy for you.. * Which class was it again?  Random thoughts: I was thinking maybe about going to the mall, but it sounds like it'll be a zoo.   everyone  exchanging things and hunting for bargains. I wonder where I can buy a Go set.  And who to play with?   {fro, I hope you were serious about playing with me ;)} Also been having the urge to cook some serious fish.  Always  loved  fish and wanted to learn to prepare it well (you know - besides batter-and-deep-frying.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.. man, I miss catching Spot and Croakers and frying them up: one hour from ocean to mouth ;). Which reminds me.  I miss warm weather, and the beach.  We watched a surfing movie last night, from the seventies.  Bad movie, good surfing. Right now, I'm very very sleepy. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - hey, you've been getting tired of winter too?  Well, as soon as we go snowboarding, winter can just go away.  We're still going on MLK right?

      it was my 1st christmas away from family, and it was very very strange... i was sad to hear church was cancelled, ended up shampooing the carpet, cooking dinner for 2 but eating by myself, painting, crocheting some blanket, doing work i brought home; all in all, it was just not the same.  i miss my family. even though we don't really do much, it was just being with them.  thanks a. and w. for cheering me up with  Like Mike . ... i know Go, but i suck at it. we can play if you would like...

      Hey, does anyone play  urlLink  Go  ? (Baduk) (Wei Ch'i)    I'd forgotten what a great game it was: Territories, battles, and crazy strategy, all on a block of wood with little stones.   Simply Ingenious .   My bro woops me every time, but I still love it  :) [For a great interactive intro click urlLink  here .]

       MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!  today,  2002 years ago, Christ was born into our world of human suffering. Holy Holy Holy is the Lord. ... service was cancelled today due to the fast and falling snow.  I am at home contemplating re-organizing my closet, shampooing the carpet, and crocheting a blanket. instead of all the above, i find myself watching bono on oprah... what i should do is worship.

      Today, i need a dose of Truth.    Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  (philippians 4)

      The best $3 i've spent recently is on my Dec issue of Esquire Magazine.  "The Best and Brightest" - it's on up and coming (mostly young) leaders in different fields of society.   Well, I bought it a while back but didn't get to really read it through til last night.  Anyway, there's some crazy smart people out there.  Among those included were actually one of my coworkers' son-in-law (a nanotech pioneer), and Baltimore's Mayor O'Malley, and Bill Frist (this was when he was much less nationally known, before anything happened w/ the former senate majority leader).  Actually, reading the Frist article gave me a lot of respect for him.  He's amazingly talented, and seems to have outstanding perspective.. i wonder if he's Christian?  (maybe Catholic?)  They also included a very talented and inspiring presidential speechwriter (who i'm almost positive is Christian).    A few cool designers and writers and artists too.  There was also this one guy who's kind of a.. i dunno, they labelled him "techno-prophet" - i forget his name.  But have you heard of "the Singularity"?  you've gotta read the article for it not to sound like some cheesy sci-fi thing, but anyway, it's his totally serious theory that a crazy progression of computer technology is going to mean life as we know it now completely "undergoing a phase change" in like.. what was it, i think it ends up being like 5-25 years from now (with "computers" basically ruling over us and that kind of thing).  He's not just some weirdo author though, he's a mathematician & predicted internet technology way before it was even first out.  And the article talked a little about other theories on the end of the world (what with nukes becoming so commonplace and all) etc, etc..   Yeah, it all sounds extreme, but when I hear different things - even with biotechnology - i can't help but get the feeling of the Tower of Babel - humans building and building and building, but we don't see what we're building  towards .  It's like there's just getting to be too much power for such self-destructive and foolish beings.  It really is very scary.  [And how can people NOT see the need for an Almighty, and that He must exist? (is that good logic even?  i dunno, but that's what comes to my mind..)]  ...so there it is.  Random things that have been jingling in my head.  Again.  ;P

      yeah, it was seriously disturbing.   Well, actually I don't know if it was suffering, it was probably just freaking out.  When L came home i told her at the door and she called in one of the brothers (JL) who was right outside.  We put it in plastic bags (when i say we, i mean JL, with L kinda supervising and me hiding halfway upstairs) so hopefully it'll run out of air and die faster than it runs out of water/food?  :*(   i dunno, i don't want to think about it. Silly mouse.  First we bought an ultrasound pest repellent thing but the next day they were just running around and hanging out in our kitchen like usual.  Then we put out some instant death /suffocation ones with all kinds of yummy bait but they never went for those.  And then we got poison, and L got the sticky traps too.   Anyway, we were pretty sure there were two in the beginning:  I think there's a smaller gray one out there somewhere - or maybe it learned its lesson and left the house? ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ All this talk of ways to die reminds me of a joke i read once.  There was an englishman, a frenchman, and a new yorker who were caught by some indigenous tribe.   The chief told them their fate:  they would be killed and their skins used to make canoes.  However, he would let each choose how they wanted to die.   The englishman said, "the pistol for me."  So they used the pistol on him and he died instantly.  The frenchman then said, "for me, ze poison."  So they gave him poison to drink, and he too died pretty quickly.   When it came to the new yorker's turn, he's like, "A FORK."  What?   "You can stab me to death with a fork."   "But that would take forever, and is a terrible way to die," they said.   "Yeah.  But you can forget about your canoe!"

      ew!  ew!! I just found a  mouse  in our kitchen, caught on one of the sticky traps.  it had been so long without seeing any of the mice that we just thought they ate the poison and died somewhere out of sight.  I almost had a HEART ATTACK seeing it.  I screamed, jumped back into our hallway, and then had just decided to be brave and throw it out to spare my roomies, when it started  twitching .  EW EWWWWW!!!!  :*(  (now I'm just hiding in my room freaking out online..)  If my one roomie L comes home first she can take care of it [i hope we can put it out of its misery instead of just putting it in the trash where it'll continue twitching..].  But if my other roomie J comes home first I'll have to lead her out of the house and call our brother neighbors for backup..     i hate sticky traps.  :( i guess they work though..

      On forgetfulness. I'm losing my mind.  I drove home for lunch to get my bag of clothes which I should have brought with me this morning (i'm going straight from work to m.c. to help set up, then after the celebration going straight to Va), only to remember that I  had  remembered to bring it.  It was in my trunk the whole time.   Oh well, whatever, so i just went ahead and ate a lunch of dumplings and yogurt and watched like 15 minutes of Spiderman (Jen was watching it.  Good movie).  Then, on coming back in to work I remembered a few of us were supposed to have a new year's luncheon in our conference rm, for which i had already contributed my $5.   What is wrong with me??  Seriously, i'm scaring myself.   maybe i should go buy myself some Ginko..  I get off early today - i just found out the City's closing at 2:00  :)

      Signed up for  bmg .  Every few years I'm so out of music to listen to that 12 cds doesn't seem like a lot (and you can't beat a deal like this at like $4 a pop). For my initial 7:  3 christian albums, 2 soundtracks, 1 -what do you call Diana Krall, contempo jazz? and 1 more Paganini.  I know, i think I now own a recording of everything he ever composed or something.  I might resell that 3-disk thing of Concertos I got last month.. couldn't decide whether it was worth what i paid for it.  You know what i wanted but they didn't have?  Norah Jones.  She's got such a great voice. And the Violet Burning.

Stayed up til past midnight assembling one of the Ikea end tables (only 19 bucks - bought two).  I remembered what a pain it was to make your own furniture (i know i know, that's why it's so cheap).  It was a serious workout putting in all those little screws.  Must get myself a power drill.   [  don't even  say  it fro..  ;P  ]

       Skittles and Graph Paper  is looking better and better lately.  There's gotta be an easy (and  cheap ) way to get ahold of a 15x15 piece of wood (and one that's thick enough, and not ugly or with distracting patterns on it)... [Been searching high & low for a suitable Go board.  Ruled out so far: Ikea's collection of cutting boards and Michaels' selection of wood pieces.] Does Home Depot cut your wood for you, i wonder..

      i mean, the information's interesting but it's definitely that much  more  interesting coming digested from the writer.  obviously for assignments like this you need sources & stats but you can tell when someone's really interested and presenting, vs. just straight facts..   that's my 2cents.  btw, it's really  great  having so many visiting columnists  :D .. really spices up the DeFro(Do).

      i take it back, i take it all back, cut and paste, do whatever you want. i don't want psuedo trash talking or people feeling bad. do whatever you want, put it back on, i am staying out of this... ... flagrant plagiarism has occured on the Assignments. I am afraid those concerned must report to the Headmaster's office immediately.   Peeps, original works in the Assignments are much preferred ok?  okay, let me say this gently, it's more fun reading what you write, are we all happy hunky dory?

       W hat falls but never breaks? fro's answer - temperature   w hat breaks but never falls? fro's answer - the day de- your answers are better.  for this, i thought maybe a heart, and then i thought the last one was related, so love.  but that doesn't make sense.   Y ou can see it, but you can't touch it. It may disappear, but has never really left you. It grows thoughout the day. What is it?  fro's answer - shadow de's answer- shadow   I t cannot be seen,cannot be felt cannot be heard, cannot be smelt it lies behind stars and under hills  and empty holes it fills de- darkness   D ies half its life lives the rest dances without music breathes without breath   W hat is better than the best, more evil than demons, the poor have it and the rich need it?   W hat has no content, yet you can see it? de- light   A s I watch I see the world pass me by. All the good, all the bad, in the twinkle of an eye.  I watch and wait, and patiently sit. I never began, so I shall never quit.  My only presence is in my being. It is hardly noticed, but worth everything.  I'm fast as light, thin as air. don't let me pass by. in the end you'll care.  To avoid me is the mark of a fool. For all you're worth, your life is my tool.  You can't beat me, But you always try. The question is: What am I? de- time

      dang that would be my fault... is it protector or protecter? it's 'or' isn't it??? aw man, i suck at spelling...  ok, i changed it, so it's the correct spelling of pocketprotector now!  clarifying:  Assignment #20 is a link, click on it to see the page to write directly on the Assignments page, go to  urlLink Blogger.com  sign in as publicmember password pocketprotector the page will change and look on the right side (you might have to scroll down a leetle) there is a navy section called "Your Blogs" click on Assignments, and it will bring you to a split screen page.  type your entry into "Edit this Post"  when you are done, hit "Post & Publish" on the top right.  Tool Bar helper: (it's the gray panel above where you type) the world link icon is for linking links, (yeees....) well, highlight what you would like people to click on to see the link and link away... the  B  is for bolding the  I  is for italics those are the basic ones... just mess around with it, no harm done ya know, ees cool.

       urlLink  Iceland  . I don't know why i'm drawn to these northern lands (i've always wanted to visit Canada, and Sweden sounds really cool too)..  Iceland is Europe's westernmost country and the most sparsely populated (almost 4/5 of the land is uninhabited - everyone lives near the coast where it's less mountainous).  Size-wise, it is comparable to the state of Virginia.  Its capital, Reykjavik, is the northernmost of any country's capital.   They have one of the highest life expectancies and lowest infant mortality rates in the world.  The best possible healthcare is accessible to all inhabitants.   So what's so cool about Iceland?   The hot water springs:   the air might be cold but the pools are toasty.  "One of the advantages of living in Iceland is the endless and ubiquitous flow of geothermal water streaming from the earth. This hot water is used for open-air swimming pools all around the country, which serve as health spas and as pleasant places to meet people*." And this geothermal energy is used to provide economical and non-polluting heating.  Hence Reykjavik (pop. 170,000) is one of the cleanest cities in the Western world. One of the country's best salmon rivers runs right through the city.  Their food:   suits me just fine -- all pure and unpolluted:   -  Lamb (is to them what beef is to us, sort of, but their lamb is gourmet.  free range like everything else there and very tender)  -  Fish (smoked, dried, Freshlots and lots of good fish)  -  over 80 types of cheese (they're very big on dairy)  Names:  Everyone uses first names, strangers or friends.  A small number of Icelanders have family names, but "by law, Icelanders must follow the ancient tradition of deriving their last name from the first name of their father (patronymic system). For example, if a man named Eirikur names his son Leif, his last name will be Eiriksson (the son of Eirikur). His daughter Thordis would be named Thordis Eiriksdottir (the daughter of Eirikur). She keeps her own name even if she marries. For this reason, Icelanders always have to be referred to by their given names. The patronymic is never used alone. Icelanders say, for example, 'the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson', but never 'President Grímsson'.*"  Bjork:   just kidding.  but she is one of theirs.  I'd like to visit in the summer.  For two to three months in summer there is  continuous  daylight in Iceland.  Early spring and late autumn have long twilight, and then the days are very short in mid-winter.  Leisure activities are mostly outdoor sport type things: Horse riding, river rafting, whale watching, salmon and trout fishing, sea angling, glacier trips (glaciers cover almost 12% of Iceland), snowmobiling and 4 x 4 expeditions over the highlands.    more from their  urlLink *official site :  Language.  Icelandic, the national language, has changed very little from the original tongue spoken by the Norse settlers. Icelandic has two letters of its own, Þ/þ and Ð/ð, which were used in old English. "Þ" is pronounced as "th" in "thing" and "Ð" is pronounced as the "th" in "them". A large percentage of English words derive from Icelandic. English and Danish are widely spoken and understood in Iceland.   Government.  Iceland has a written constitution and is a parliamentary democracy. A president is elected by direct popular vote for a term of four years, with no term limit. Most executive power, however, rests with the Government, which must have majority support of Althingi, the Parliament. Parliamentary elections are held every four years. The government is headed by the Prime Minister. The cabinet stays in power until the next general election or a new government is formed. The ministers sit in Althingi, but if not elected members of parliament they do not have the right to vote.   Climate.  Iceland has a relatively mild coastal climate. The average summer temperature in Reykjavik, the capital, is 10. 6°C/51°F in July, with average highs of 24. 3°C/76°F. The average winter temperature in Reykjavik is similar to New York City's, about 0°C/32°F in January (average highs are 9. 9°C/50°C). Usually the weather is very changeable.   More facts:  Population:     279,385  Ethnic groups:   Homogeneous mixture of descendants of Norse and Celts.  {basically if i ever visited i'd stick out like a sore thumb.}  Religions:   Evangelical Lutheran 93%, other Protestant, Roman Catholic and more  {wow.  the Evangelical Lutheran Church is the state established church, if you haven't guessed}  Literacy:  (definition: age 15 and over can read and write, total population): 99.9%   And last but not least,   urlLink IMAGES  from Iceland. click around.. landscapes, etc.  don't worry if you don't understand the words..  It's  magical .

      hey, thanks for the offer, crispy.  but that reminds me, we caught mouse#2 over the weekend.   M had come back and we were all gathered around the kitchen counter telling her about how i discovered the mouse, etc, and we wondered if the other one died too, when L suddenly screamed.  "omigosh, the other one's in the trap over there!"  (she said its belly and tail were stickin out but none of us turned to look.) So our good ol JL came over a second time and threw it out.  (we need to bake him cookies, or something)   This time it was the suffocation trap so it was good and dead.   YAY.   Now i can stop talking about dead and dying rodents  ;)  if anyone wants mousetraps we have many different kinds...

      just thought you might enjoy this ~ courtesy of dictionary.com    quidnunc   \KWID-nuhngk\, noun: One  who  is  curious  to know everything that passes; one who knows  or  pretends  to know all that is going on; a gossip; a busybody.  What  a  treasure-trove to these venerable quidnuncs, could they  have  guessed  the secret which Hepzibah and Clifford were carrying along with them! --Nathaniel Hawthorne, [1]The House of the Seven Gables  Some wretched intrigue which had puzzled two generations of quidnuncs. --L. Stephen, Hours in Library  Quidnunc comes from Latin quid nunc?, "what now?"  it's cool huh?   + do you remember back in the day on Sesame Street, they would show how they bottled milk or how baked beans were made? I loved them. Apparently, there is this one show now called  urlLink unwrapped  that does the same, I wish I have cable just for that...

ROWLING'S  HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF PHOENIX TO BE PUBLISHED ON JUNE 21, 2003 IN THE UNITED STATES, BRITAIN, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA  The World's Most Anticipated Book Is Over One Third Longer Than Previous Book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  NEW YORK, NEW YORK:  LONDON, ENGLAND: January 15, 2003 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, by J.K. Rowling, the fifth in the bestselling series has been scheduled for release on Saturday, June 21, 2003 in the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, it was announced today by Scholastic and Bloomsbury publishers.

In making the joint announcement, Barbara Marcus, President of Scholastic Children's Books in the United States, and Nigel Newton, Chief Executive of Bloomsbury Publishing in Britain said: "We are thrilled to announce the publication date. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is absolutely superb and will delight all J.K. Rowling's fans. She has written a brilliant and utterly compelling new adventure, which begins with the words:"   The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive.....The only person left outside was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four.   "Later in the novel, J.K.Rowling writes:"   Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses.'It is time,' he said 'for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry.  Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything.'    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is over 255,000 words compared to over l9l,000 words in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  The new book is 38 chapters long, one more than Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.      ah!!! i can't wait!

      i just came back from a meeting - my intro to a new team i was to inherit, and all i want to do it complain wrah, wrah, wrah, wrah... it's such a boys club, crude jokes, man he's such a ham, blah blah blah... i don't know why, it's not even such a big deal, but i feel like i have been ambushed and beat up, and afterwards, everyone just dusted themselves and left, and here i was, assigned to clean up the mess. *sigh... it's just work right? it's just work.  ... i just bought off ebay a lot of 35 knitting needles. I think they used to belong to some granny... I say used to, because, you know... i just guessing, but why else would anyone want to part with their whole set of knitting needles?...  i once bought ping pong balls at a flea market from an old man who then went into telling me how his old cat used to love playing with them. They he was telling me how sad he was when the cat died and how he hoped i had fun with the ping pong balls. somehow i remain unphased by these things. people didn't want to play with me and my ping pong balls, but heck, they're just balls, and i think the cat doesn't mind.  i hope the granny doesn't mind that all i can make are scarves or anything that fits in the rectangular category. I made a hat that looked more like a tea-cosy once, i gave it to my sister, and she put it on her bear and promptly left it in Canada. I suppose it's not cold enough in hong kong to wear it, but hey, i would have liked it if she pretended to like it.  was anyone paying any attention? am i just talking to myself?  well anyways, my point is, i have a lot of knitting needles coming along if you need to borrow any.

      dobedobedo  you know what's gross?  (i feel like i'm always sharing gross things, sorry)  There are now  two  little squirrel "rugs" on the road right outside my building.  two pink-tinged artifactual remains splayed out for all to see (or step on).  the first one's been there a whole week, totally grossing me out.  {who's in charge of cleaning up this kind of thing anyway?}  fro: The City's supposed to clean it up! Go talk to your mayor ;P de: yeah, probably someone in the city but i dunno who.  i wonder if there's an official city roadkill cleaner upper..? fro: I hate the pigeon roadkills the most, them with the flappy wings, just sick... i bet there is a roadkill cleaner man, i wonder what he looks like.  fro: my friend stepped on a rat (dead one) one time in the gutter... gross... do those count as road kill ? de: ok, roadkill's gross, but i'd rather step on roadkill than a random dead rat any day..  you don't know if it died from rabies or bubonic plague or what. y'know what i mean?  nasty yo.  If there is a roadkill cleaner man, i hope he comes around to my street soon.. fro: I looked online for "roadkill cleaning crew" and found absolutely zippo... Good luck my friend, you might have to get used to the little rugs. de: no, no: check  urlLink this  out.  (ok, so that's probably a joke but i saw other articles..  urlLink roadkill men  do exist!) fro: well, the question is, do they service Baltimore City?

      i have found a semi-healthy approach to a cheap lunch. I have been real busy, so have to eat at the desk, but I still like to get out for sanity's sake, so I walk over to ghetto-eddie's on eager st and get a salad from the salad bar. minus the bag of chips, my lunch cost me ~ $1.25 or so, not bad... as for the chips issue, i didn't want to shock my body too much ;p ... i was just thinking, I always insist on putting 5 - 7 odd croutons on my salad, but in reality, i don't really eat more than 1 or 2, but i must put them on, cause the salad just looks naked and not balanced without them... ???  croutons or no croutons, that is the question my friend, that is the question...

      yeah.  partly cuz it's not fun walking around outside these days and partly to save money, i've been bringing my lunch.  but sadly, all i could manage for today's entree was a tv dinner  (lean cuisine turkey drenched in imitation gravy with sweet potato paste on the side).   it's been years since i had one.  i guess some are better than others, but i feel sorry for people who make regular meals out of them.  yecch.

      the mark of a true packrat.  i'm a seller on half.com -  just a few books and cds. they make it really easy: type in the upc, and the pic & descriptions are automatically brought up.  they even recommend a selling price.  then when you have a buyer, the site sends an auto email with where to mail it, and you just get a check in the mail every few months or so.   But anyway, i have to admit that with almost every single item that gets sold i feel sudden regret, and have to stop myself from canceling the purchase.  Never mind that it was just collecting dust before.  Then at the end i'm just like, 'man, this person's getting a  great  deal..'    [just now sold a william carlos williams selected poetry book for $3.99.  i forget how much i paid for it]

      i read that Matisse studied a lot of Pointilism which is a branch of impressionism. " As a young man, having been a student of Odilon Redon's, he had closely studied the work of Manet and Cézanne; a small Cézanne Bathers, which he bought in 1899, became his talisman. " we had to memorize impressionist paintings by different impressionist painters my freshman year of high school, that about wrecked impressionism for me, just like the 1800 literature in college with a prof who asked me if i knew english wrecked Bronte and such for me... ... there's going to be  floism, froism... dennisism, whodoism.... he he he... ...  going to the dreaded dentist on monday....

      Matisse, Mattise...

I wasn't planning on moving too soon, but soon enough, like maybe in 2 or 3 months, after i go to the motherland and obtain a digital camera and scanner :) then come back and all of a sudden have a sudden rush of wealth and purchase a computer. the thing is i think you need to find a host or server or something like that for movable type... i don't really understand it yet, but I'm looking into it. I figure if i were to put up a projects page, I will move la blog with it too? i don't know, kinda like, since i'm paying for something, i might as well use it up for all it's worth yaknow?

Pictures.  And font formatting.  And some actual control over how your page looks.  But it sounds like a commitment (esp if we have to pay).  there's something about free bloging that makes it fun & spontaneous/ voluntary ,  know what i mean?

And personality develops [read  urlLink this  about development, from raja's guestbook site].   On top of that, we've got God changing and growing us..

      i watched  Iris  last week (i dunno whose it is.. wayne's??) - it's about this headstrong woman who becomes a famous novelist, and in her later years starts losing control of her mind to Alzheimer's.  One evening, before she is diagnosed, she finds herself having trouble even spelling out words as she tries to finish up what would be her last novel.  She turns to her husband who's nervously watching her and says something about going mad.  "How will we know if we're going mad?  ..People would tell us.  Wouldn't they, John?..."  british movie i think.    there's something refreshing about foreign films.   in general, they're more  real , and less  spelled out  for you.  at least from what i've seen.

      see, that's what people say, and i thought so too, but you live with C for a while and you get to wondering.  i'm telling you, sometimes i get a brown carbonated water craving.  can't explain why. actually until more recently i never drank diet sodas.   i'm not really sure what happened..  .. and did you say ralphy?

      oh, sad.. she was telling me last night that she felt kinda weird. *...hope you get better quickly, hon...*  soda pop. I like fountain sodas.  I love mixing them: you make your own drink.  you get to decide your own calories/sugar & caffeine content, and come up with a new taste.  like Diet Pepsi with a hint of Cherry coke.  (that way it's not too sugary or too cherryish, and you still get that crisp diet pepsi flavor.)   or Sprite spiked with Mountain Dew  :D    otherwise, I guess i'm not too big on sodas, but i'd have to say pepsi beats coke any day.  (I noticed at superfresh yesterday that it comes in weird packaging though.  like for coke they sell six-packs of cans and eight-packs of 20-oz bottles along with the bigger boxes of cans, but for pepsi it's just a six-pack of these weird extrabig (25-oz?) bottles, or the big boxes.  i wonder why that is.)  Well, once in a while i see the value of caffeine-free diet coke, which i don't think there's a pepsi equivalent for.

       urlLink here  is an article.   (i suppose we'll have to record the state of the union address  if it starts at nine)  I'm kind of going off on a tangent, but this got me thinking about Leadership.  Even without requiring that one leads  well  or in a Godly way, just being one of the Select Few who have to call the shots and draw lines where there's often only massive gray area -- especially where the consequences are measured in  millions of lives   -- cannot be an easy burden to carry.  A random thought that kind of gripped me as i was going to bed last night was that if we could ask for only one quality in our leaders, we should ask that they be God-fearing.   Anything else is really secondary.

      frodo reporting back on duty. ya know the fever hence being semi-out-of-it, made the dentist appointment not half bad. I was kinda chill in the chair... anyways, what's with this fighting against what people think about crochet/ knitting thing? I like being a granny, I don't hardly care. someone get me a dozen cats, bifocals and a tea cozy, I'm all set my friends. it's not an addiction, it's just nice to be able to make things for people. Grannies aren't cool man, they're sorta crazy and cuddly and smelling like baked tarts :)

       crochet is   urlLink  cool  .  (proof courtesy of L, and NY Times online)  just wanted to make that announcement, for everyone's information.  There seems to be rampant and unfair stereotyping of crocheting and knitting as Frumpy Old Lady Occupations (FOLO).  [L and I considered working on our current projects during the superbowlfest -- and there would have been NOTHING wrong with that -- but could only imagine the amount of teasing we'd get!]  I mean, just cuz yo' granny happens to crochet doesn't mean it's not hip, right?  [staash man, the addiction has only been s p r e a d i n g  since you first started us on it.]  hopefully this will also help justify the number of crochet links we have on our site..

      yeah, i guess cuz blue's a cool color it's not as distracting as the warmer greens or browns..  my beef with most hazel contacts on asians is that they kind of pop out at you and it's hard to focus on anything else.

       ~ things i learnt taking photos on the street this morning   * flying plastic bags refuse to move when you aim your camera at them. * don't wait for a "right" moment, pigeons fly away - snap once you've focused. * have no shame, have no shame at all, people will stare, it is O-Kay. * pro & cons of gloves:    pros - your hands don't freeze onto the hunk of metal in your hands   cons - the glove gets stuck on the button and your shutter freezes open * it makes one hungry, walking around on the cold windy streets. ... have to get more film.

      oh, so sorry ms. dede!! why do sicknesses have a way of pouncing on one when one has a day off?  remember when my body decided to turn itself inside out and empty me of all i contained when i took a day off? yick... i think it's some sort of trigger when you relax over a certain limit and your body says, alright, it's time to purge, so the sickness kicks in...  about the ears being stuffed, you can try to hold your nose and try to blow like you would blow your nose. don't do it too hard, it's bad for your brain. that's what i was taught how to equilibrize my ears when i dove.

      to entertain those who are having slow afternoons, or a rough day ~ the  urlLink Mary Blair , illustrator of It's a Small World @ Disney World  for ms. stachie whose carnivorous computer ate her work:  urlLink Matrix in Lego ~ engrish style  ... ooo, why do you get mlk off and lincoln's b-day off, how bout president's day, do you get that off too? and valentine's day and mondays and wednesdays too? you city folks man...  ... de:  yes, president's day, and good friday (how great is that!)!  but remember when i didn't get veteran's day?  (but got  columbus  day)  and i didn't get any slack around the nov / dec holidays..!  i dunno who makes our holiday decisions.   ... i went home and made O-Deng for lunch, I turned it on low to simmer while I had my 1st bowl and when I went back to the stove in like 10 minutes, the O-Deng quadrupled in size, it was really funny, like giant O-Deng. Anyways, yeah* :)  (btw, you killed my post ;P) (de: sorry, i guess when we're both in at the same time it just takes one of our edits) fro: looks like you have the dominant server, or i have sticky fingers ~ slower with the mouse...  ... hey lookee who you talkin to, i don't get mlk, got as little as you for nov/dec holidays and most definately don't get good friday (we're mostly jewish with the higher up peeps, we don't get religious holidays cause they don't want to take jewish holidays off...) ah well... don't miss me too much tomorrow.

      did i tell you i get tomorrow off?  yup.  what, it's Lincoln's Birthday.  a very important date in history. i think i will immerse myself in the half-dozen projects i've had ongoing forever.  maybe try to finish one. And maybe even do a little reading up on the Man of the Hour himself.  :)

      i forgot to tell you, the other day, my boss went downstairs to the accounting department, also where they keep all the cool stationary ~ hence my multi-colored highlighters and many many post-it pads; anyways, he went downstairs to turn in a check request and came back with a sheet of flourescent orange circle stickers just for me just for kicks. now if you knew my boss, you would know he is up tight and no nonsense, so this caught me totally off guard since this is stuff I would usually do... so yup, i think my insanity has rubbed off on my co-workers. I am very proud of myself :)

       urlLink email  is such a wonderful thing.  one of the many things our generation takes for granted.  but replying just now to a reply of the forward of my original email, with everything documented & accessible at the scroll of my mouse, i thought i would give it just a little shout out  ;)   ( urlLink more ) ... fro: truly a well deserved shout out! I also love being able to send a word/ excel document through email without having to get out of the program. technologically challenged me just found that out a while ago, so i can send all my PO's straight from word w/o trying to attach everything :)

      upon request, the story of mad cow's disease:  In 1907, Dr. Alzheimer published a treatise about a disease that would one day carry his name.  He had two young colleagues who worked with him, Dr. Creutzfeldt and Dr. Jakob, and they too identified a similar brain-wasting disease that now has Europe in a panic.  The brains of cows turn into a sponge-like mass and their behavior is called  urlLink "mad."   The human variant of Mad Cow Disease has been named Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease, or CJD.  The protein causing CJD has no DNA, and has been described as more like a crystal than cellular material.  In labs, 1000 degree Fahrenheit heat does not destroy this protein particle.  Some scientists say that once infected, the incubation period can last anywhere from one month to thirty years.  As the human brain turns into a sponge, this spongioform encephalitic condition physically debilitates those so infected.  so the symptoms are as follows: cognitive impairment  ataxia (Loss of the ability to coordinate muscular movement.)  visual distortions or impaired visual acuity  delirium  myoclonus (A sudden twitching of muscles or parts of muscles, without any rhythm or pattern, occurring in various brain disorders.)  dysarthria (Difficulty in articulating words, caused by impairment of the muscles used in speech.)  profound dimentia that leads to death  -  being slightly delirious, spastic, demented as well as inarticulate, i fall into all the categories, but it is not nice to make fun of something serious, so i won't. i don't have mad cow's disease. but i also come from the big HK, where there was the chicken flu epidemic ;p    urlLink psychotic disillusions

(people who lived in england from 1980 to current for a substantial amount of time can't give due to high risk of exposure to mad cows disease. come to think of it, i drank a whole lot of milk, ate beef like no tomorrow, had butter, and cheese... well, the disease has an 8 year dormancy period so that's 2 more years to go, hey i'm still alive.) sad sad sad... i didn't save any lives today.  ... did you know 1 donation of blood saves 3 lives?

He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.  3 I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies.  [] 25 To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,  26 to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.  27 You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty.  28 You, O LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.  29 With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.   30 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless.  He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.  31 For who is God besides the LORD?  And who is the Rock except our God?  32 It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.  33 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.  34 He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.  35 You give me your shield of victory, and your right hand sustains me;  you stoop down to make me great.  36 You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn.  [] 46 The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock!  Exalted be God my Savior!  []

       Do Not Worry   22Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. 23Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. 24Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! 25Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life[2] ? 26Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?  27"Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 28If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! 29And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. 30For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. 31But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.  32"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. 33Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. 34For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

       do  -- if you ever read this, i had like a ton of dreams about you this morning.  we were just chillin', munching on these huge bags of korean snacks... i vaguely remember something about a 125-dollar bill..  anyway, i had fun  ;D  i was reading about dreams and i guess most people have a flood of dreams starting at around 4am?  i always thought it just felt like that cuz you only remember the last few.  and then they say that dreams are just leftover thoughts and images from your day, but sometimes there's all these complex plots and twists that i feel like i would never have come up with on my own.. but of course the first few moments after waking when i'm pondering the dreams i'm not thinking too straight.  it's probably 90% nonsense.. dreams are such funny things.  did you know that people born blind dream too?  they dream in sounds. ... is it me, or is our blog page just slow lately?  is the template really meaty..?  everything i post takes a lot longer ... i'm glad you feel better fro :)   i'm still kind of lightheaded.  three fingers on my left hand were numb and tingling this morning. ... fro: did you sleep on your fingers? oh, you didn't know? Google bought Blogger - hence a lot of heavy behind the scene renovation i think, which is partly why the template died (this is entirely my stipulations, i think it was google and my joint efforts that killed our template) the template's not meaty, actually it's kinda trim, but Blogger is having issues, indigestion or something. I think they are still working out some bugs.

      a real life Scam Alert:   Police want you to be aware of a new scam.  Thieves are putting a thin, clear, rigid plastic "sleeve" into ATM card slots. When you insert your card, the machine can't read the strip, and asks you to re-enter your pin number.  Someone behind you watches you enter and re-enter your number.  You may give up, thinking the machine has captured your card and walk away.  The thieves then remove the plastic sleeve with your ATM card, and empty your account. To avoid this scam, run your finger along the card slot before you put your card in.  You can feel a couple of tiny prongs on the sleeve that the thieves use to get it out of the slot.

      have you heard the story of Stone Soup? my elementary school class performed it, i think it was the first play i was ever in.   it's about these two hungry scoundrels who come upon a villiage and scheme up a way to get themselves a nice meal.  they pretend like they're a pair of great chefs, carrying around a stone and boasting about how great stone soup is.  Stone soup is very tasty, but stone soup with a few carrots, now that's excellent.. the rather miserly villiagers they run across are reluctant to participate but they do, contributing what vegetable or spice or meat they have, until at the end there's a really grand soup, and the whole villiage is brought together to feast.  i don't know why i was thinking about this exactly, but just that in some way, some of what our consultants do for the government kind of reminds me of this. (have i totally lost you?  that's ok, i'm not so sure i understand myself)

      I took my chewy flintstones vitamin (wilma, i think) and i'm feeling better now, but yesterday i was feeling anemic -- lightheaded & dizzy like i have bad circulation or something -- and was more unconscious than usual last night.   anyway, like most other times when i'm extra tired, i was having some  intense dreamage .  not that i remember anything spectacular happening, but just that it was all so clear and felt real.  you know how sometimes you dream yourself asking if you're dreaming?  i was like,  huh? this is a dream?? ..  it was such random normalish stuff:  conversations, scenery, little details...  i dreamt someone asking me a question and replied out loud.  (don't know if roomie heard me.. hehe.)   With the sun rising in the morning, i thought to myself that it must be close to 8:00 and opened my eyes to check the alarm: 5:12 ?? was i dreaming?  shall we just go back to sleep and let our real alarm wake us?   but no.  it was almost eight.  the clock must've broken overnight. i had to check another clock and my wristwatch before admitting it and fought my way out of bed..

      bonjour, le fro. i'm bored.  been reading through operations manuals and an instrumentation report.  snore...   it's nice to have a slow week though.  snow  again ??  ok, drought's over, it can stop now.  for real. yes, i'm so ready for spring too.   i wonder if a new york outing would be possible, one day in april or may..?  It would be nice to check out MoMA (matisse picasso ends in May) and eat yummy Malasian food @ china town..  ;P  i have small group tonight.. or else i'd go with you.

      yes, yes and yes! image hosting means we have a leetle home somewhere out there in the great dubya dubya dubya to hold some info so we can copy an image say from the web, save it in the place and therefore being able to show that image on the blog site ( i think...)

      if we do, will we have everything together on one site (old&new)?  even if we come back to the small size someday?   and image hosting means that you can directly cut and paste pics off the web?..

      should we go plus-size with the blog so that we can do image hosting?  it's either $5 a month or $50 for a year. there's a set $5 setup fee.  what say you? what say you????

      i'm going for a russian tea party theme, but i don't like each blog being in its little cage, i want the day's blog in one box... still trying to figure it out. i borrowed a co-worker's html for dummies book, so maybe in a week or 6 we will see some original template action, right now, it's just me trying to mess with the pret-a-porter ones.

      i'm hooked on BK hashbrowns.  fat little quarters, crispy and warm.   yum. i consoled myself with them after driving out to essex(?) for a meeting that was postponed til tomorrow. also stared a squirrel in the face for a good five minutes.. the resident inspector puts peanuts out on the railing of the office trailer where we meet.  i was standing on the platform when this squirrel climbs up and starts munching away on them like i'm not even there... cute little critter.

      it's not my boss, he's just fine, i even helped him pick out a toy to send to his niece (legos!) , and he's in town. he was out just that day working off site.  i can't leave this desk, the Product Manager that I was supposed to have a meeting with at 2.30 is late (he gives me the creeps) so I have to be here.  i down in the dumps cause of this stupid html email process that i have been sorta pioneering. you would think a publishing company should have a system capable of sending mass emails other than just text, but no. so i've been waiting for the web group to debug this program for like a month and a half to send out this email, meanwhile, the publisher of that product is getting hot under the collar cause we're taking so long, so i'm the sausage in the hotdog ya see, so if the 2 sides of the bun don't cooperate, the dog can only squirm. luckily, the publisher is one of the nicest people i've worked with, and he's being really really patient, while I just feel even more guilty + want to kick the web guy's butt cause cooome ooon, 1 1/2 months, things expire and need to be done over and over again week after week + he keeps evading me. i'm just too super duper nice (i know, can you believe it? i'm nice at work) and people walk all over me. maybe i should send the pug upstairs (my co-workers bring their pets into work...) and have him bite the web guy in the shins.  phew, okay, one long run on complaint. i'm so sorry, thanks for listening. just say a leetle prayer for me that i may be God focused here. thanks.

(not multi-mode for a and g)..  will it mean i can't get online in a few places where others w/ multimode would be able to?  or is it just how fast the connection might be?..

      hm, ok after more browsing, i think i'd be happy with a  urlLink Gateway450   (the 14" S series but beefed up a bit)..  p4 2GHz-M/ 384MB/ 40GB/ modular DVD&CD-RW combo/ windows xp pro/ norton anti-v and ms office small business for about $2K even. i had to reconsider with the modular drive cuz i wasn't considering that as an option before but i think i could live w/ it. i know.  no one else is shopping laptops and this post is putting you to sleep.  but i thought i would, in case someone better informed has any burning opinions.. ... fro: ouch, that's pricey, is that how much laptops are going for nowadays? ... actually it's like $1,780 which is really good but then adding the software was $200 more, plus i'm getting knicknacks like a mouse & surge protector.. and shipping's free ... hey what happened, my rant was cut short, did you delete it by accident (or on purpose grrr...)? do you like the font?  ... hehe, sorry.  mine got cut off too..  what did you say? yes  :)

      let me just take the opportunity to plug one more animal (one of my favs!):  urlLink razorbills.  i first saw them at the baltimore aquarium, flying under water (the exhibit showed a cross section of their pool & ice ledges).  it was unreal, seeing them flap their wings like normal birds and then just pop up out of the water onto land.  they're fast.  they fly perfectly well in air too.  incredible little creatures.   and  i just read that a majority of them happen to nest in Iceland:  yet another reason to visit   :)

(and isn't it funny? the door is in front!) how did you convert from zip to jpg and did you have to save it somewhere first?  and what about bmp files? ... i tried to shrink it and it's all pixelly... let's see what should i do?...  oh and you have to save exactly what you want to show, size-wise and all that jazz, i had to save it on my desktop first... i think bmp's should work too.   i unzipped it, saved it on my desktop, re-sized it then saved it again with a new name and then saved the new image on the ftp server. it is funny, but is it comfy to drive? looks a little constricting...

It's weird thinking back that far.  i can't say i really like reminiscing on those days...

      Sick       by Shel Silverstein   "I cannot go to school today," Said little Peggy Ann McKay. "I have the measles and the mumps, A gash, a rash and purple bumps. My mouth is wet, my throat is dry, I'm going blind in my right eye. My tonsils are as big as rocks, 'I've counted sixteen chicken pox And there's one more-- that's seventeen, And don't you think that my face looks green? My leg is cut, my eyes are blue-- It might be instamatic flu. I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke, I'm sure that my left leg is broke--  My hip hurts when I move my chin, My belly button's caving in, My back is wreched, my ankle's sprained, My 'pendix pains each time it rains. My nose is cold, my toes are numb, I have a sliver in my thumb. My neck is stiff, my spine is weak, I hardly whisper when I speak. My tongue is filling up my mouth, I think my hair is falling out. My elbow's bent, my spine ain't straight, My temperature is one-o-eight. My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear, There is a hole inside my ear.  I have a hangnail, and my heart is--what? What's that? What's that you say? You say that today is... Saturday? G'bye, I'm going out to play!"

      is it me, or is it the weather, or is it just me being under the weather? An inexplicable tiredness washed over me while I was home for lunch, and as I curled up for a nap, too tired to care about the cold; delicious sleep overtook me and the minutes felt like days. It felt almost wrong to have to wake and run out the door, locking away the soft comfortable sleep to return to the hard tap tap tap of typing, or perhaps it is just the effect of falling asleep to Virginia Wolf and her quiet assertion that Mrs. Dalloway is buying the flowers herself.   or maybe i'm just nuts.

      Mt.

      fro needs your help everybody ~  i am in the process of putting together my final project for my photo class, and stupid me, thought I would double the work by putting some creative writing along side my pictures. So... being that i haven't used my creativity for quite some time, and running programs at work totally suck me dry, I am totally not doing very well. Last night when I showed doris some of the stuff, she just shook her head at some and said that they didn't quite work, so i need all y'all honest opinion and advice. I'll be linking the pictures + the writing on the page (hopefully sometime this weekend) please let me know yay or nay on them.  shanks in advance :) - - - - - phew... I just drove over to hopkins at lunch to meet with my photo teacher, and she says I am in good shape!  oh and Spring Fair is on full swing, i so forgot about it, too bad I have absolutely no time to go... too bad, first time I will miss the whole thing for (wow...) 6 years. okee I'm old. parking is a mess-pot, it is absolutely crajee.

I suppose you can go swimming, it's no little swimming hole though-- it's huge.  On weekends they close a big portion of the road that runs through there and people bike and rollerblade and picnic by the water.  people fish there too but i hear boats are not allowed.. ... i'll try to get my bike fixed up this weekend  :D  yay.

      about the beanstalk ~ there's this theory in our apartment - whatever fro does or buys or grows or cooks and such is big and beastly... except that beast plant of Dorice's (which she wanted to kill, but i have secretly revived with mucho plant food, so it's being as beastly as ever!)   all i can say is it's good to be home - you know B'more seems so peaceful and quiet compared to NY. I love it here.   other fascinating facts from fro's NYC visit: * China town NYC is da bomb! * i am eye-level to my brother's lower chest !??!! the humungo beastly thing runs in the family see...  * my mom looks so cute and little next to my brother.  * NY is BIG, and my feet hurt.  * whoever decided to keep Central Park as a park is a genius.

      I love Sinatra. I thought I'd tell y'all.  - - - - - after really yummy food in NY, i don't want to eat anything here... (except for esthie's great home-cooking) eee, i'm turning into those spoilt nasty girls who turn their noses on everything!  (never fear - i eat everything, things i like and things i don't like)  i think it's how i was brought up. we had to finish everything in our bowl before we could leave the dinner table - i think i set a record of sitting there for something like 4 hours when i was little, i would just sit there with the food in my mouth for ever. my mom (who was trying to feed me) fell asleep, so she gave up that time - and i didn't have to eat all my vegetables ;p

      i was entirely frustrated, it's sort of funny but not, and it just sounded slightly like self-glorification when i typed it up... which is  not  what i meant, so i just took it right off... i think frustrating sums it up nicely.

      anyway, the pit beef was yummy.  the best part was the makeshift buffet table of condiments-- pickles, sliced onions, barbeque sauce, creamy sauces, ketchup, horseradish, mustards... i used a little bit of everything  :)  oh yeah, and we all picked out houseplants to bring back home with us.  (please let this one live)

      O-m-G.  Has anyone else's Outlook been acting up on them?  Nothing I send is going through & it's not letting me view attachments to emails.

      I hiked 15 minutes to the flower mart festival only to go and order some mediocre sushi from Minato ~ the lines at the festival were sooooooooo long.   Truffles (the caterers) had some pit beef that smelled REALLY GOOD.  I also smelled and saw from far away: crabcakes, hamburgers, lemon-peppermint sticks... there were some people on stage with mics that well.. shouldn't have been on stage or given mics  :]  ... many many catholic high school booths... and a great little latin music group.   Flowers, flowers, flowers.  hung out with comfy & howo for two minutes each. Maybe we'll go back for that pit beef after work   :)

      exerpt from the B-Sun paper:  Lemon-peppermint sticks, ugly ties, pretty hats, maypole dancing and lots of flowers. It can only mean one thing: Flower Mart 2003.  This year's Flower Mart takes over Mount Vernon Place from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday and offers its usual array of floral displays, crafts, activities, entertainment and delicacies.  Exotic flowers, bedding plants and plenty more greenery will be on display and for sale. Visitors can check out the specialty garden or watch floral demonstrations.  But who are we kidding? You're coming for the lemon-peppermint sticks, the crab cakes, the pit beef and the raw bar. And to check out the entries in the Ugly Tie, Grand Hat, Fantasy Hair and Hilda Mae Snoops Art contests.  Visitors will also be entertained by the Peabody and Waldorf School Maypole dancers and hear live music from Love Riot and the David Bach Consort.  The acoustic duo Milkshake will keep the kids occupied, as will the Oriole Bird and the Bowie Baysox mascot. The Baltimore Zoo will present a puppet show, and Baltimore City's Mounted Police horses will strut their stuff.  There'll also be an antique car show, arts and crafts, a crewel work demonstration by the Embroiders Guild, information on health issues and more.  The first official U.S. Flower Mart took place in Baltimore in 1911, organized by the Home Garden Committee and the Municipal Art Society. Later marts were sponsored by the Women's Civic League. The event is now organized by Flower Mart at Mount Vernon Ltd.  Visit Flower Mart 2003 from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Washington Monument at Mount Vernon Place. Rain date is May 15.

      Attended a seminar on Pumping Stations today.  So interesting and so very boring all at once, you know how it is.  The very disturbing symptom I've been having these past few days is a most intense, out-of-control coughing fit.   I know one of them is coming on when I feel a crazy itch in my throat: Suddenly I'm hacking so hard I can't even inhale, and i'm all hunched over and tearing up and slobbering, with my face completely red.  it's a lot like dr. jekyll / mr. hyde actually.  i totally identify with that character now. I felt mr. hyde coming out in the middle of the seminar and panicked cuz i foolishly sat far away from the door.  I coughed my way out of the auditorium but barely made it to the ladies' room before the really scary part came... whew.

And I miss boogey boarding.  * popsicles and BBQs and lemonade.   and every holiday that involves an outdoor picnic  :)  // dudes i'm roasting in here.  = ;(  unlike the fro, hot sticky air & sticky skin are DEFINITELY not on my  good things  list.

      hello world.  (we're back ~:)     // One korean business that's flourishing in downtown Balto is the new york style lunch buffet.  i'm pretty sure that Gina's Cafe = Big AppleTree Cafe = the new Sweet Melon Cafe :   when i walked in with howoso & saw the same (owner?) ajumma at Sweet Melon as i've seen at Gina's and AppleTree my jaw dropped.  they're all walking distance from each other...  that's one mad monopoly, they must be doing VERY well. anyway, Gina's will always be my favorite...  despite the ghettoer decor, all the same menu items just taste better there.    aww, fro, i felt bad enough that you couldn't come with us ~ don't be breaking my heart like that~!   :*(  i actually tanned & managed not to get burned this time.   also showed the waves who was boss.

      Learning to savor silence and quietness of heart  TV has never before been so grating to my soul: the noisiness of it is just too much.  Every show and commercial is designed to be attention-grabbing; to manipulate your thoughts this way or that its pretty distasteful really.  Why should I subject myself to that, when its hard enough to stay focused on real things?  Well, lately I guess Ive been too busy to veg ~ which, like someone once said, really is a blessing because you dont have time to do dumb things or live stupidly.

He wants a Yao Ming jersey set, where do i go to get that? let's hit the flea-bay!

      Blessed are those whose strength is in you,  who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.  As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools.  They go from strength to strength,  till each appears before God in Zion.  (from Psalm 84)

      i went around this whole morning with the craziest hair.   in the car on the way to work i had randomly stuck bobby pins in to get my hair out of my face and didn't check the mirror til five minutes ago.  how very embarrassing...   let me just commend the consultant i conversed with in the hallway for keeping a straight face the whole time.  (man, the things i do to myself that force me not to take myself too seriously)

      look what my company just sent around:  "One of our local homeless people has recently assaulted one A**** employee this week (kicked them) and threatened to punch another employee just this morning. Both incidents were completely unprovoked. The police are coming today so that we can see what can be done about this problem. In the mean time, please be extra careful if you see this person and try to avoid walking alone. He's a tall black male who is completely bald on top but has a bushy "bozo style" ring of hair around the sides. He usually in filthy tattered clothes and is often wrapped in a dirty blanket He's always dressed like it's freezing even when it's warm out. He's a regular in Mt V., so keep your eyes peeled and keep your distance if you see him."   that guy keeps talking to me, I'm so scared of him... eeeek!!

      okay... where did summer go?  it's like it stopped snowing, then it rained, then it turned cold again ?!?! I didn't even get to unpack my summer clothes :( anyways, I was sending my brother to school and I got (as I usually do in Fall after I graduated) - school envy.      I want to go back to school, I love the nice new textbooks, the bi-yearly new start of semester, the new folders and notebooks, new pocket protector (okay, just kidding) but seriously, school is so great - must study hard from GRE's to get into school, which reminds me, I better go to the library to check out some GRE books at lunch - studying, I miss that too.   school is so hopeful, work is a perpetual pummeling.

       * The Mickey Murder *     O nce upon a time, there was a little mouse called mickey . One day he found his way to a burrow in Roland Springs and decided to make it his home. Yesterday, he smelt the storm brewing in the air and decided to find shelter in a warm and cheery home, so he picked the nicest and friendliest house in the neighbourhood and moved in, hiding out by the trash cans until the storm passed by.   In this our nice friendly house, lived 4 eccentric women, one was Ms. Esthie, she was kind and gentle and loved to read, the second was Ms. Teeny who loved little children, the third was Ms. Elway fashionista diva, and lastly, and the most eccentric of them all was Ms. Frodo who lived in the dungeons who liked to think that there weren't any teeny micey creatures sharing the house with her.   On this fateful morning, Ms. Frodo was awakened by Ms. Esthie as Ms. Esthie lovingly drives her to work every morning. Ms. Frodo dragged herself from her lair and was waiting in the dining room next to the front door, looking at the pantry and trying to decided if she wanted to bring any snacks to work. Ms. Teeny was home with her mom, so she was absent in this following most gory scene. Ms. Esthie came down shortly, and all of a sudden exclaimed, "Gosh Golly, I saw a teeny weeny mousey creature behind the trash can!"   They were an environmentally aware household and so they had 3 trash cans - 1 for regular trash, 1 for bottles, and 1 for paper, placed in that order against the wall.   "Leaping lizards, what should we do?" Ms. Esthie pondered.  "Kill it! kill it!" Ms. Frodo shouted.  mickey was much perturbed by the noise and screeching that had unceremoniously awakened him from his slumber, decided to find a quieter place to rest his little head, so he scuttled along the wall to hide behind another trash can.   "it ran to the other trash can!" Ms. Esthie proclaimed.  "AAAAAAaaaah!" Ms. Frodo replied.  mickey was disoriented and disturbed by the high pitch screaming, and he made a bad decision, the worst decision in his life, he zoomed behind the third and last trash can, leaving him trapped.   Out of thin air, there was a resounding sonic BOOM of a kick - Ms. Esthie aimed at the last trash can and gave it all she got ->    this brought Ms. Elway down from her morning regime to see what the racket was all about. By this time, Ms. Frodo was reduced into a little whimpering screaming wreck-thing, hiding behind the kitchen counter.   So Ms. Elway got the broom, stabbed at the fateful trash can a couple of times, and the Brave Ms. Esthie pulled it from against the wall. There lies the limp body of mickey, once so full of life and our trash, now motionless, prone on the linoleum - there was life no more. This sad scene was adjoined by screams all around (I wasn't the only one screaming ok?)   the story doesn't end here, no, no, there is more, much more.   was mickey to receive a proper burial that the hero of any story deserves? was he to be returned to the earth which he humbly came from?   "How should we get rid of it?"  "Who's getting the mouse?"  "Where are brothers? We need brothers!!!"  Exclamations flew like cross-fire in the air... - but Ms. Esthie, the stillness in the storm, swallowed hard, got the dustpan and proceeded to remove the poor nasty little dead mouse from their house.   We exit the front door and proceed onto the front lawn ->      the house with lovely bushes in front of it    "Throw it into the bushes," Ms. Elway said, and so Ms. Esthie took the lifeless form of mickey and hurled him onto the middle of the lawn. Mid-hurl, Ms. Elway and Ms. Frodo realized the error of this brash action, and they both belted out "NOT THERE!!!" so Brave Ms. Esthie had to once again, try to gently prod the little nasty dead mouse onto the dustpan (this is much harder to do when it is nestled in dew-soaked grass than on linoleum). Once Brave Ms. Esthie managed to retrieve our little mickey, she proceeded to find a good spot to hurl him into the bushes. "Over there,  away  from our house..." Ms. Elway advised.  So after careful calculation of wind direction, branch angles and gravity's pull, Ms. Esthie chucked the poor dead thing into the bushes. mickey's lifeless form plumetted through the branches, landing not far from a family of wrens, which vociferously protested as they came streaming out of their bush.   so thus ends the fateful tale of mickey our minute mousey friend. So long, little one, and rest in peace.

      what? you now look like Zoolander? why do you look like Zoolander?  oh dennis.... sorry about the dentist thing.    - - - - - on a separate note - - - - -   For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strenghthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkeness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1: 9-14  how do you combine the feelings of "I suck" and "thank you God" ~ cause they are swirling in me like OJ and milk, making something really wierd.   I suck - because I'm stupid-like-a-mule-and-refuses-to-budge-when-God-tugs-at-me - I look at the task at hand and declare it too hard and quit on the spot. (but you know, once I get going, it's really not that bad - maybe i should have said that I am a lazy-butt...)  thank you God - because he has "qualified me to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us fromt he dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."   conclusion ~ i want to be all these things: bearing fruit in every good work,  growing in the knowledge of God,  being strenghthened with all power according to his glorious might  so that you may have great endurance and patience,  and joyfully giving thanks to the Father,  who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.  thanks lo for blessing me w/ this Word last night: "... my yoke is easy and my burden is light."     "DON'T BE STUPID! DO IT, JUST DO IT FLO!!!"

      frustration is taking a day off for a much needed dental appointment only to be sent on a wild goose chase by mapquest.com.  this dentist has such limited hours of course, there was no way they could fit me later that day.  i should have known better.  mapquest is evil. i was partway to annapolis at this point so i decided to make the best of it and get some images from our capital city.   on another note, i must have slept on my face wrong cuz i woke up looking like someone gave me a black eye.

       the chemicals we drink.  i drank 12 oz of mountain dew this morning & now i have that distinct sick feeling i sometimes get.  i've gotten it after drinking fruitopia & fruitworks sodas too.  i feel a little like hurling but mostly it feels like i have some muscle or nerve disease & all i want is for someone to step on or pound my back/shoulders.  I used to get this feeling every once in a while and never made the connection to what I had drank til more recently.  Anyway, now my mission is to figure out exactly which of the chemicals I'm drinking is affecting me.  MOUNTAIN DEW is: Carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and or sugar, concentrated orange juice and other natural flavors, citric acid, sodium benzoate, caffeine, sodium citrate, gum arabic, erythorbic acid, calcium disodium EDTA, brominated vegetable oil and yellow 5.   FRUITWORKS (Peach Papaya) is: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Filtered Pear Juice From Concentrate, Citric Acid, Phosphoric Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Sodium Polyphosphates, Natural Flavors, Potassium Benzoate (Preserves Freshness), Gum Arabic, Potassium Citrate, Potassium Sorbate, (Preserves Freshness) Xanthan Gum, Ester Gum, Calcium Disodium EDTA (To Protect Flavor), B Vitamins: Niacin, Pantothenic Acid & B6; & Yellow, Red 40.   Possible culprits:  high fructose corn syrup, one of the "natural flavors", benzoate (a good possibility), citrate, calcium disodium EDTA (sounds pretty gross, maybe this is it), the Yellow. yuck.  by the way, don't you just love that Dew has vegetable oil in it?  once you know this, you can't help but notice how smooth it goes down...

       chemicals part II  by the way, it's definitely the benzoate.  (diet pepsi and orange soda are two more things i will never drink again) i'm looking at my diet pepsi bottle and what i don't get is that it's there to "preserve freshness".  freshness of what?  which chemical needs this chemical to be its preservative?  tsk, tsk.  i have to admit it's a good thing to cut down on food additives  :)

      hmmm... you know, I think you bring up a good point about the zoom - I don't think it has optical zoom, i was reading a ton of reviews and stuff, and i think i have gotten stuff mixed up, so I am definitely re-thinking it if it has no zoom, dang, what am I going to do with it if it has no zoom? that sucks...   anyways, I think my priorities for the camera are the same as yours, and having shopped around a bit, I think a Canon Powershot is the way to go for me, just have to decided if I have the big bucks or the small bucks. (really I have no bucks, but I figure, invest right?)

<date>03,June,2004</date>

      there's a discrepancy in the info:  is it 5.7x optical zoom or 5.7x digital zoom? if it's optical, that's amazing!  and what i read so far is impressive, esp. for $350.   but if it's digital zoom you know it really doesn't mean much: enlarging the pic in photoshop would give about the same result (grainy zoom).   but then again zoom means a lot to me -- i don't know if you care as much.  you know what made me go with a canon was their rechargeable lithium battery.  i don't think anyone else has it.  i suppose regular non-rechargeable lithium's not so bad, but digital cameras eat up power like crazy & i didn't want to keep buying batteries.  i didn't really want the AA size rechargeable batteries either.  also, i've been pretty happy with canon's processor (auto focus/exposure etc).  so that's why i chose my camera as opposed to the many many other good ones out there.  the other thing is, how much manual control do you want to have, cuz esp as you're taking photography classes, i think you'll feel the limitations of just a point-and-click...  (then again, size and cost is the other side of the coin) ... cool!  that's very good of you to offer, considering that your head has hit the tempo dispenser more than anyone else's   ;)

        -- this was a great little product that, sadly, got discontinued.  i just found out when i went to ebay looking for refills for my long empty car visor dispenser: no wonder i could never find the refills anywhere.  Tempo was like a cross between kleenexes (soft, and how it dispenses) and paper towels (thick & durable), and the car visor idea was really convenient -- except that a couple of my taller passengers would always be bumping their heads into it.  hopefully i'll win my bid for the 8-pack.  but after that, who knows how long they'll even be available?...  sad sad.

       Psalm 33  1 Sing joyfully to the LORD, you righteous;  it is fitting for the upright to praise him.  2 Praise the LORD with the harp;  make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.  3 Sing to him a new song;  play skillfully, and shout for joy.   4 For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.  5 The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love.   6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.  7 He gathers the waters of the sea into jars; he puts the deep into storehouses.   8 Let all the earth fear the LORD;  let all the people of the world revere him.  9 For he spoke, and it came to be;  he commanded, and it stood firm.  10 The LORD foils the plans of the nations;  he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.  11 But the plans of the LORD stand firm forever,  the purposes of his heart through all generations.    what else can we say, as God opens the door to two students' lives, right before our very eyes?    Lord, I am  floored  by the way You move.

      when I am at work, I am always facing my computer - my world from 8.30 till I leave is engulfed with data, numbers, text, phone calls and clicks on the mouse.  my work computer faces a window looking out at the skyline of west downtown. the glare is something terrible in the winter months, so I have an anti-glare screen, which somehow just reflects the light even more, giving me a clear view of what is outside my window.  I was reading something off the screen and just shifted my focus a little - noticing that the sky reflected on my screen is brilliant blue against the brown buildings, and there are wonderful fluffy clouds streaming from the left to the right as if on fast forward, and I was reminded of God.  And I want to live such that I never forget and have to be reminded.

       An Era Better Forgotten - we wish!   this is all very silly, and when I first saw it on someone's blog site, I was all nuh-uh...

      POUR INTO ME                      (by Pastor J.)  Find me in the river, in the waters of submission Longing to hear the words from your lips With you Im well-pleased  Find me in the river, in the waters of humility Longing to see the heavens released With powerful dreams  Will I dare to see the possibility of all the things Ive never seen?  Lord, Im looking up and Im open wide Let your dove descend on me  Pour into me your visions and dreams Pour into me your empowering Pour into me your visions and dreams Pour into me your empowering  Find me in the river, in the waters of surrender Longing to feel your Spirit on me Guiding my destiny

      from Mark 12. 41 Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. 42 But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny. 43 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 44 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."

(3) lotr - fellowship of the rings was the best of them all, but they are all good - beating star wars hands down.   (4)  urlLink mini ipods  - I keep telling myself, "my old skool ipod is still cool..."  (5) there is so much I want to do, 2004 is a good time to start!

      {95 is apparently closed down~ take 295 if you're heading south tonight everyone.  or at least check the news first.}  hm, something's wrong with my hip/left leg joint.  i was wondering why but after thinking about it a while, my theory is that i dislocated it slowly over this weekend putting those long hours in at my laptop: i tend to sit with my right leg crossed over my left, and doing that for too long probably did something bad.  i know.  i'm going on granny.  someone get me a walker.

( loyal?? ),  "does she have any terrorist contacts?", and so on.      i think it's actually more funny to me cause she is actually  so  pro-u.s.

      oooh... deedee don't get sick, I still have severe side effects from the sickness: I still can't really taste food - and there's been this funny bitter taste in my mouth for the longest time, + I'm suffering from insomnia, I am waking L. up bumping around in the dark.   fro's tips to getting better: * sleep - a lot - nyquil will bring a horse down for 48 hours.  * drink - a lot of water, or hot tea.  * take medicine once you've got minor symptoms so the minor symptoms don't develop into major symptoms.  * call up y'all brothers and sisters and ask for healing. (heh... this should be first probably...)  ...............................................................  on another note, our house went to watch "Meet Me in St. Louis" last night at Toby's - it's really fun!!!! can we go again for my birthday? the main character was serving our table, it was a real treat.  "Meet me in St. Louis, Louis, meet me at the fair...."  "Clang, clang, clang, goes the trolley..."  we had this Reader's Digest collection of showtunes when we were growing up, I think my mom or my dad got it for some reason and we found it stuck with some elvis tapes and such in the back of a cupboard, and we played them all to death, so showtunes bring back childhood memories :)

      I've been ignoring the beginnings of what could be flu symptoms, hoping that they'll give up and go away -- this flu strain sounds like a serious bummer, and anyway i've already fought off my fair share of viruses these past few months!    Hopefully my old high school trick of echinacea & goldenseal will still work.      Yup, I recommend the hard core concentrated droplet kind.

      3 good things about business trips 1) it gets you out of the office 2) you get to rent a cool cherry red car and not pay for it yourself 3) you get to act important and mature, like you really know just about everything   3 bad things about business trips 1) it's really a 13 hour day rather than the normal 8 hour day at the office 2) taking off your shoes at the airport check points  3) vendors who don't feed you well + yucky airport food which makes you hungry and want to hurl at the same time

      lack of sleep does things to your head...  this morning, my alarm woke me at the usual 7.15am, after I turned it off and went back to sleep, I had the following dream:  I was living in a house under the sea and every morning I would swim to the surface to go to work. Somehow, this morning, there was no sunlight coming through the waters and everything looked sort of scary. My underwater house isn't on the ocean bed, but suspended a bit higher. I looked out of the window and saw a whole ton of these scary looking creatures, they looked like small crocodiles but jet black and with red eyes, and there were these people wrestling them to control them. They were swarming everywhere, and my first reaction was, "oh nice, I gotta call into work and tell them I can't come in this morning..."   i wish there were monsters swarming my front door, not really, I just wish I can have a couple more hours of sleep.

      i just got in touch with my old high school college counsellor and her assistant - they were just such wonderful women... sigh... it's been what 7 years since high school and they still remember me.   I had such a great time in high school - it seems that most people just have so so experiences... but i was looking through the school webpage and remembering the things I used to do - my old friend who got me into riding is actually running the riding program, and they are building a big old gym with a swimming pool. i was in the very first hockey team we had and it looks like the team has flourished through the years :)   i was a very blessed girl.

Strengthen the feeble hands,  steady the knees that give way;  say to those with fearful hearts,  "Be strong, do not fear; your God will come,  he will come with vengeance;  with divine retribution he will come to save you."   Then will the eyes of the blind be opened  and the ears of the deaf unstopped.  Then will the lame leap like a deer,  and the mute tongue shout for joy.

      on God and Authority - part of  urlLink an article on Bill Wilson  on the Washington Post, co-founder of AA.   Wilson had a friend named Ebby Thatcher, another alcoholic, who had a friend named Roland Hazard, yet another drunk, who was wealthy enough to seek help from the eminent psychiatrist Carl Jung in Switzerland. When Jung realized how serious Hazard's drinking problem was, he told his patient that the only hope was a religious conversion -- in Jung's experience, nothing else worked. The American psychologist William James had arrived at a similar conclusion, declaring in "The Varieties of Religious Experience" that "the only cure for dipsomania is religiomania."   Well, by God, Hazard got religion and sobered up, for a while. He preached this approach to Thatcher, and Thatcher in turn proselytized Wilson.   "I was in favor of practically everything he had to say except one thing," Wilson later recalled of his conversations with Thatcher. "I was not in favor of God."   After a couple of days at Towns Hospital, Bill Wilson was past the d.t.'s and feeling really low. Science could do nothing for him. He now realized that he couldn't kick the booze by himself. Yet he was unable to believe in the only power experts knew of to save a drunk.   Then:   "Like a child crying out in the dark, I said, 'If there is a Father, if there is a God, will he show himself?' And the place lit up in a great glare, a wondrous white light. Then I began to have images, in the mind's eyes, so to speak, and one came in which I seemed to see myself standing on a mountain and a great clean wind was blowing, and this blowing at first went around and then it seemed to go through me. And then the ecstasy redoubled and I found myself exclaiming, 'I am a free man! So this is the God of the preachers!' And little by little the ecstasy subsided and I found myself in a new world of consciousness."   Wilson never had another drink.   Carry This Message   Brimming with vision and new consciousness, Wilson blew back into the familiar world as if everything had changed -- not just for him, but for all of creation. He bragged that he was going to save every drunk in the world. He went scavenging for men to preach to, finding them in missions and hospitals and jails and among his own drinking buddies. Some of his targets thought he sounded an awful lot like the Bible-brandishing temperance ladies he had rebelled against as a young man. He discovered that many alcoholics were "not in favor of God" -- God was an authority figure and drunks don't deal well with authority.    no so much about how Bill Wilson beat alcoholism, he died craving a drink. He ultimately didn't believe in God - but twisted God into a New Age Pantheistic thing.    Unlike many spiritual visionaries, Wilson came to understand "that when he heard the voice of God, it was often just the voice of Bill Wilson," as Cheever puts it. And so, in the now-famous catechism that he created, AA members are pledged simply to turn their will and lives over to "the care of God as we understood him," with italics right there in the Big Book. Prospective converts are often assured that they may take as their God the nearest radiator if that's what works for them. Almighty God with the white beard, or a gentle breeze in the treetops, or the sublime engineering of a molecule, or the vastness of space, or the love of friends, or the power of the AA meeting itself: Choose your own Infinite.   Whatever works.   I have mixed feelings about this article... but to see it published in print that God is the only one who can ultimately heal is good.

      Faith.  Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.  This is what the ancients were commended for.   By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.   By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.   By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.   And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.   - Hebrews 11:1-6    How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!  How vast is the sum of them!  - Psalm 139:17    Whom have I in heaven but you?  And earth has nothing I desire besides you.  My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.  Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.  But as for me, it is good to be near God.  I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge;  I will tell of all your deeds.  - Psalm 73:25-28

      OK, I'm not walking under any more trees this month.  I got back all late last night and went upstairs to where jn & jnfr were,  when jn cries:  Eeee! there's a CICADA on your back!!   (i would have thought it was a joke except that jn DESPISES bugs more than anyone and would never ever joke about them.) For the next few seconds i was yelping and hopping and running in place while jn went to grab st (my hero!) to get it off.  The grossest part was hearing the buzzing wing sound when she grabbed it.  Sick.   I would have been more traumatized if i had seen it i think.   Afterwards, everyone kept going  Eeee!

      For you, O LORD, have delivered my soul from death,  my eyes from tears,  my feet from stumbling,  that I may walk before the LORD  in the land of the living.  I believed; therefore I said,  "I am greatly afflicted."  And in my dismay I said,  "All men are liars."   How can I repay the LORD  for all his goodness to me?  I will lift up the cup of salvation  and call on the name of the LORD.  I will fulfill my vows to the LORD  in the presence of all his people.   Precious in the sight of the LORD  is the death of his saints.  O LORD, truly I am your servant;  I am your servant, the son of your maidservant;  you have freed me from my chains.   I will sacrifice a thank offering to you  and call on the name of the LORD.  I will fulfill my vows to the LORD  in the presence of all his people,  in the courts of the house of the LORD -  in your midst, O Jerusalem.   Praise the LORD.  Psalm 116:8-19

      for both of us,  for all of us - grateful for God's Grace that comes from Love.   I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. - - - - - Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD ,  the man you teach from your law;  you grant him relief from days of trouble,  till a pit is dug for the wicked. - - - - - My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline  and do not resent his rebuke,  because the LORD disciplines those he loves,  as a father the son he delights in.   Blessed is the man who finds wisdom,  the man who gains understanding,  for she is more profitable than silver  and yields better returns than gold.  She is more precious than rubies;  nothing you desire can compare with her.  - - - - - And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.  What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?  - - - - - Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.  - - - - - Then Job replied to the LORD :   "I know that you can do all things;  no plan of yours can be thwarted.  You asked, 'Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?'  Surely I spoke of things I did not understand,  things too wonderful for me to know.   "You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak;  I will question you,  and you shall answer me.'  My ears had heard of you  but now my eyes have seen you.  Therefore I despise myself  and repent in dust and ashes."

      I need to take this.  Jeremiah 17:5-9  This is what the LORD says:   "Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength  and whose heart turns away from the LORD.  He will be like a bush in the wastelands; he will not see prosperity when it comes.  He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land  where no one lives.   "But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him.  He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots  by the stream.  It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green.  It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit."   The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure.  Who can understand it?   "I the LORD search the heart and examine the mind,  to reward a man according to his conduct, according to what his deeds deserve."   Psalm 86:9-13  All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, O Lord;  they will bring glory to your name.  For you are great and do marvelous deeds;  you alone are God.   Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth;  give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.   I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart;  I will glorify your name forever.  For great is your love toward me;  you have delivered me from the depths of the grave.

      In the process of creating a theology that accommodates apathy, disinterest, compromise, and even rebellion, we have lost the essence of the movement for which Jesus died.   We made a mistake of making heroes out of those who were simply living a normal Christian life.  There may be no more significant ingredient to the apostolic ethos than establishing a radical minimum standard. The gatekeepers for our culture are not the heroes or supermen, but the common person it is the common person within each society who establishes the boundaries that are required to remain a part of the clan. It is not the extraordinary standard but  the minimum standard  that is the critical boundary in shaping a culture. To unleash an apostolic ethos, it is essential to establish a radical minimum.  It is essential to call people to a radical minimum standard.   taken from  An Unstoppable Force  by Erwin R. McManus via ecclesia blog

      For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.  For it is written:     "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise;         the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate." Where is the wise man?  Where is the scholar?  Where is the philosopher of this age?  Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?  For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.  Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.  For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.   1 Corinthians 1:18-25   "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,  and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.   Proverbs 9:10
