      Just a quick one today. On my left is none other than Ryan Diggle, talking about the Royal Marines...again. He's looking at machine guns, on the internet, commenting on their size. Remarks like "look at the size of that thing!" and "look at that, Ryan!" do get tedious. Gotta love him, though (I mean, it's actually a VERY BIG machine gun).  I'm in DT at the moment, and seeing as I've done everything (brag, gloat, etc), I'm logically doing something productive like updating my blog. Thing is, I can't find anything to talk about. Hmmm. *asks Diggle*.   I know, this upcoming end of GCSE/Gig Night thing. A private party is coming up on July 10th, and for just £5 (yes, children, 5 whole pounds, ask your parents nicely), you'll get an evening of booze, partying, 6 live bands and more booze. According to Monsieur James Henry, booze will be available there, but people should bring there own as well. Tickets can be aqquired from Diggle, James, Tim Watson and Chris Ellis. If you don't like those people, then piss off (so says Diggle). No ticket, no entry.  But it's end of the period now. PE awaits me, followed by History, then physics and finally french. Woo. Hoo.  Laters.

      Hey there, guys and gals. My apologies for that Cr@Zy double post on thursday. My habit of double clicking and stuff brushes off onto everyday things...related to double clicking, of course.  Well, it's official, I have my Reading ticket ordered. Ordered it today, after hearing the jolly news of more headline bands, including The Offspring, Greenday, Ash, Lostprophets and Franz Ferdinand. Other bands in the line-up will be announced at a later date, apparantly. So far, the weekend is looking good. I can't wait.  Blurgh, this history coursework is the biggest bitch ever, though. I mean, I know it's shorter than the last one, but it is soooo boring. My political section goes along the lines of "blah blah blah, war was catalyst for the downfall of the liberals, blah blah blah, dangerfield reckons war had no affect, blah blah blah, here is a quote from his book:, blah blah blah, wilson thinks differently, blah blah, some random crap, blah blah, i think that the war..." Well, you get the idea, yes? To make matters worse, it's in for friday. So. Much. Work. So. Little. Time.  Aaaanyway, at least my D.T. work is all finished. Hip hip hooray. I'm very pleased with my work, y'know (for details see previous post(s)). Now, if I didn't have a shitty, half-witted teacher (no, Emma, not your Dad), then maybe I wouldn't get a shit exam result, eh?  Well, I best be hitting the road and doing that History coursework. Or something.  Cha cha, real smooth.  Laters.

      Hello fine readers. I grace you all with a blog update.  So what's been happening as of late? Not much. Been working hard on my DT project, which makes a change I suppose. I finally got the thing painted on wednesday. And it looks excellent, which in turn put me in an excellent mood, as I was so impressed by the sheer excellence of the paint work that I look forward to seeing my excellent grade I will be receiving in the summer... *cough*  On the subject of DT, I hate it.  Moving on. Easter Holidays soon. I'm a bit puzzled over how to react on this one. No reaction would maybe suggest that I am a deprived young lad who could not even think of the prospect of missing school, so as a result, is too heart stricken and frustrated to say anything. Or I could go for the, *ahem*, 'OMG! OMG! EASTER HOLIDAYS!!!11!!!!1! 2 WEEKS OFF YEY!!!' thing. But that would just be worse. I could say yay, but yay isn't a word, y'see. If I said yay, people would surely laugh and point at me for using a word that does not even exist...right? Whatever. But in all seriousness, I think I'm gonna start revising for real when we get time off. These exams aren't easy, so I've heard.  Still, I was talking about exams with my guitar teacher (cool guy). With him having taken the exams and gone through the whole CV process, he said to me that through all the jobs he's had (he has had a few), he said that he has never had to use GCSEs/O-Levels/whatever to land a job. Ever. 'Interesting,' I thought. In addition, he also said that people he had worked with had made up all of their GCSE results, A-Level results, and even qualifications. They all got away with it. Hmmm. Still, it's not like I'm gonna slack off and make up my GCSE results in the future. I just thought that it was intruiging.  In other news, I've started my long-promised fantasy novel...again. It I get it on computer I'll link it to the site and you can all read my brilliant story. Or crap story. Or mediocre story. Or good story. Or whatever. You're the ones with the opinions, guys.  Also,

      Watching the cricket at the moment. A good day all round. Very slow progress when Butcher and Hussain were together, pace picked up after Butcher was (unfairly) dismissed after he "struck" the ball (when in fact he didn't). Since then Thorpe has been solid while Flintoff and Reid have both come and gone. Flintoff looked promising (as always) before he got carried away (again) and was caught. Still, we're leading them (West Indies) by 40 runs, and we're looking good. At the moment it's Thorpe and Giles.  Anyway, enought about cricket. This weekend I went to my guitar lesson, which was kool. Did excersises based upon the 12-bar blues which were fairly straight-forward. Also doing pentatonic lead excersises which, well, aren't straight-forward at all. Appears I have a lot of practicing to do.   My cousins came round briefly on saturday and caught up on the last month. I also loaned out a whole load of albums to Stven while he finally returned the 4 Metallica albums I gave him. Apparantly he doesn't like buying his own stuff, so naturally he'll just "borrow" it from me.  Oh, and my dad tried to fix my cd player and...failed. And he calls himself an electrician. I doubt there's nothing electrical about it, however. Simply retrieving a lost cd from inside the thing can't be  that  difficult, right? *ahem*  Well I guess that's all folks. One last thing:   158 days, 2 hours, 35 minutes   till the Reading Festival.  Laters.

      G'Day Mate(s)!  It's been a busy day for one such as I today. Why? *shrugs* Just has. Been doing some of the old homework. A little bit of physics, a tad of German, a fucking huge amount of History... Stupid homework/coursework/torture.  I very much doubt I'll be aloud out during study leave, which sucks. I mean, I can imagaine it now... me chained to my desk with a stack load of books in front of me, with my mum guarding me while she watches the cricket. Bah! You call that parenting? Still, nine week holiday after...  Moving on, as Reading draws closer the rumours of who are playing and who are not begin to stack. At the moment the only real certs are The White Stripes and The Darkness. Muse seem to be favourites, as do AC/DC (if they were there, it would rawk 100%). Others include Lostprophets, The Offspring, The Dstillers (yesssss!!!!), AFI and I've also heard that Feeder may be there too. Don't take my word for it though. Official line-up comes out in April. Pre-sale tickets are all gone, while the other 30 odd thousand weekend tickets come out after the line-up is announced. Normally they'll all be gone my mid May time, so after that the only way to get them will be from eBay or from "dodgy geezers" outside the festival itself (may be fraud though. Thou hast been warned).   So anyway, I was hoping to get a pre-sale ticket (y'know, snap 'em up while I can). However, many allegations of fraud and, well, fakes, were being made, so I kinda decided to wait 'till April. Hopefully I can get a ticket the day they're released. They do sell quickly, y'see.  In other news, the cricket starts again tomorrow. Now that seems to be all well and good, but oh no! I'm at school. Pfft. Well, at least I have the weekend. Also, my CD player has broken. I don't know why, but it may have something to do with the poor Metallica Reload CD that's stuck inside it (long story). Still, my dad'll gladly fix it after my 'fix it, or buy a new damn one' threat. *smiles*  Still, I gotta run. Or go. Or log off. Or whatever. The cat is wanting to be fed, and my History coursework is politely asking me to finish it.  Laters, y'all.

      Good evening, y'all (y'all being all those who will actually read this, which will be hardly any, I imagine)  Well, right to the point. It's Sunday, and I've been doing History coursework all weekend. That has completely eradicated the english homework, a chemistry practice paper, a German essay and some French revision completely. Man, that school works us too hard.  Still, life isn't bad. The exams are coming, sure, but along with the exams comes a nine (yes, nine) week holiday after. Halfway through I'll be going to the lovely island of Tenerife, and to cap it all off I'll be at the Reading Festival. I can't wait.   But this is only a short post, I'm afraid. I must get back to "homework" (laughs). Do note, however, that I'm not willingly starting up this brand spanking new blog. I'm currently at gun point with none other than Wardy behind the trigger. With a gun, you never know where his imagination and cunning can lead to.   Laters.

      Today, this blog update will suck... your blood.     Unresolved issues. They haunt you like, erm... umm, err, something that has a tendancy to haunt you. A lot. Anyway, so many of them floating around at the moment. One day I'm just gonna sort them all out, one after the other, like a man. *snaps out of dream* Oh, sorry. I'll re-phrase. I doubt I'll ever be able to sort them out, mainly because I don't have the bottle to. Dang.   But anyway, yesterday I finished something that has bugged me for nearly a year now. No, it's not my 3 book long fantasy trilogy. No, it's not the guy who lives opposite me, the guy who insists on washing his car with a powerhose at 6.30 on a Sunday morning. It is, in fact, my D.T. coursework. Let me portray my feelings:  WHOOOOOO!!!!!!  Ahem. It's a good feeling.  Before I leave, I have to say that it's been a while since I last watched England play cricket (although there's debate as to whether that's a good thing or not). What do I settle for? County Cricket. Pfft.  Oh, and one last thing. As Keith pointed out, it's hypocrite. Not hypocrit. I is a fool, man.  Laters.

      Hypocrits. Don't you hate them? Well, maybe not  hate  them, but don't they just really irritate you to no end? *sigh* Especially when you're personally involved.   Been one of those weeks. I mean, first it's back to school, and that's bored me. Then just little things have annoyed me. I won't name any incidents or anything. I've just had one of those weeks.  Anyway, to make matters worse, the cricket was abandoned today. FUCK! Stupid West Indian monsoon weather. Bleh. Still, West Ham won in the football. Take that, Stoke. Mwah. Or something.  DT still haunts me like a ghostly abomination... thing. Evaluation has to be handed in on Monday, and I've done, erm, none of it. Add a flow chart to that mess and it's one busy Sunday for me tomorrow. Grr.  Well, that's enough "enlightenment" from me today. I hope you've been enlightened. If you haven't appreciated this blog update, expect a visit from Bullet proof Tony and Shotgun Steve tomorrow morning.   Laters.

      Samurai Swords. These are so cool. Really. I got to hold one yesterday. And they rule. Funny, really. They're much lighter than you actually think. They feel very comfortable, and the blade on them is  very  sharp. Cool!  I was also given a lesson about Japanese duelling with these swords, and how the two duellers are only allowed one stroke (ie. one swing with the sword, then it's the nest guys turn, and so on). Very interesting stuff. Ollie, your Dad rules because of that sword.  Anywho. Today, today... Hmm. Not doing anything fun. Just another day of sodding about doing fuck all. Whoops. I mean revision. Of course. How silly of me.   I must leave you now my brethren. To do that revision, obviously. *loads up Neverwinter Nights*  Laters.

      Du bist ein N00bJ!!!11!!11!1!  Yup. That's what me, Ollie and Keet have been saying... all night... no, really. As well as laughing our arses off in doing so. Other classics include Du bist ein F@g! and Uphill Gardener. Ahh, the wonderful world of l33t.  Other great quotes of today/yesterday/whatever include these fine dialogues.  Raz: Will, you stupid, gay Fag!!  Keith: No guy thinks they're attractive unless they're an arogant cock.  (To which Will replies "But I look fucking fantastic!". Yes.)  Ryan: *To god* Smite me you motherfucking twat. (I'll be sleeping easy the rest of my life...)  That, plus the six-person orgy, added up to quite a decent sleepover. Damn cold outside though. *shiver*  Adios.

      Good evening, all. How are we? Good? Splendid.  Revision is crap. But I wont bore you with rants over how revision is the bane of my existance. Let's just say that I'm bored of it, and I have plenty of other things to do.   Well, it's Easter Sunday tomorrow. Yet the only thing that'll be different tomorrow from any usual Sunday will be the huge turkey in the oven. God knows why we're having a turkey for Easter, probably cause we got a free one at christmas. Anyway, I hope everyone's having a good Easter and all that nonsense.  But today I leave you with two dialogues from one of my favourite films of all time, Pulp Fiction. The first one I wrote down off-by-heart, but the second I had to get off the internet (I'm quite proud of that). Don't ask why I'm posting them, I just think they're pretty god-damn funny. I also think that it shows the genius of Quentin Tarantino. Lot of swearing, by the way.  Jules: What does Marcellus Wallace look like?  Brett: What?  Jules: [pointing his gun] Say "what" again. SAY "WHAT" AGAIN! I dare you, I double dare you, motherfucker! Say "what" one more goddamn time!  Brett: He's b-b-black...  Jules: Go on.  Brett: He's bald...  Jules: Does he look like a bitch?  Brett: What?  [Jules shoots Brett in shoulder]  Jules: DOES HE LOOK LIKE A BITCH?  Brett: NO!  Jules: Then why you trying to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?  Brett: I didn't!  Jules: Yes you did. Yes you did, Brett. You tried to fuck him. And Marcellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody, except Mrs. Wallace.   Jules: Oh man, I will never forgive yo ass for this. This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit!  Vincent: Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, then he's automatically forgiven of that wrongdoing?  Jules: Man, get out of my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty bitty pieces of skull on account of your dumb ass!  Vincent: I've got a threshold, Jules, I've got a threshold for the abuse that I'll take and right now I'm a racecar, man, and you got me in the red. I'm just saying, I'm just SAYING it's fucking dangerous to have a racecar in the fucking red, that's all. I might blow.  Jules: Oh, you ready to blow? Well I'm a mushroom-cloud-laying motherfucker, motherfucker! Everytime my fingers touch brain I'm Superfly TNT, I'm the Guns of the Navarone. IN FACT, what the fuck am I doing in the back? You the motherfucker should be on brain detail! We fucking switching, I'm washing the windows and you picking up this nigger's skull!

      Right. I've got it sussed. Ignore that last post. Kurt Cobain did die on the 5th (so experts say). His body was actually found on the 8th. Took me a lot of effort to find that one out. Heh.

      Heh. Finally, the perfect Ryan Jay has made an error. *gasp* It was actually April  8th  that Kurt Cobain commited suicide. Not the fifth. The numbers do look like each other in small print though (good excuse, Ryan. They'll believe ya for that one *thumbs up*).  Anyway, the plot for the missing hair gel thickens. My brother has had his hair gelled for the past two days (including today). Funny, that, seeing as it was yesterday morning that it went missing. Coincidence? I doubt it! However, I'll need more evidence before I make an accusation. Better ask him soon though. He leaves back for college tonight.  That was just a quick one, folks. I'm off doing, erm, revision. Or something.  Laters.

      Been a rough week ladies and gentlemen. Still, I'll try and pick myself up.   I was very pissed off yesterday, though. Last night I was at a party/evening meal celebebrating someone's birthday. I was a bit down and out last night, and I acted like a bit of an idiot just sitting there and doing nothing, only talkling to people who I felt like, and whatever. Fair enough. But what I didn't appreciate were the comments I was receiving. Taking the biscuit and leaving the crums everywhere was "*sigh*, what's wrong now?" When that particular comment was made, I honestly felt like shouting at the top of my vioce, for everyone to hear, a big "FUCK OFF!" followed by me storming out the damn restaurant, cursing all the way back home. But I didn't, which was rather sensible, I think. I didn't enjoy it, most of it was my inability to socialise. As I said, though, rough week. One of those weeks that just gets worse as it progresses.  Anyway, on a happier note (for English cricket fans, anyway), England have won their first test series against the West Indies for over 38 years. We ruled. Hoggard got a hat-trick, Thorpe got a century in the 1st innings, Flintoff took 5 wickets in the West Indies' 1st innings. Overall, as I said, we ruled. Hopefully we can get the whitewash and beat them in the fourth and final test. Fingers crossed.  Cricket is not the only sport I've been watching lately, however. On saturday I watched the FA Cup semi-final on saturday (Arsenal-Man Utd). Football has always affected me, mainly 'cause my family is very fanatical about the beautiful game. Quite distressing really. My beloved West Ham are wasting away in the 1st Division (funny, really. They call it the 1st division, yet it's actually the 2nd...logic, anyone? I think it's because it used to be the 1st, until the premiership came along). But the Hammers (that's West Ham's nickname) are looking, well, shit, basically. It makes me sad. *cries*  In other news, my hair gel has gone AWOL. Some evil member of my family has actually hidden it. No jokes (well, to them it was a joke, obviously). So my hair is a mess at the moment. (eh, what? it's always been a mess? you wanna say that to my face? oh, you do, eh? *runs*).  Laters.

      Ha ha! In the computer room in my house is a huge leather chair which was delivered to my house today. I must say, it's the most comfortable seat I've ever sat on. Except maybe the sofa in the living room. Oh, and my bed. Nothing beats my bed. But then that's not a seat... Anyway, it's a damn comfortable seat, this office chair. Now I can pointlessly browse the web in comfort. Yay!  Well, I had my German listening today. It went good. Not brilliant, but then not bad. Better than I was expecting iot to be. So that's kool. Only writing and reading to go. I always love the writing exam. Gives me so much freedom, and lets me show off my German grammar knowledge... if any. Yes. As for reading, well, I can cope, I suppose. Depends on the question. As they say, s'only easy if you know it.  But anyway, half term next week, so a little break before the exams. Does get bloody hectic after that though. Science, maths, business studies and french start to come in. Argh! Still, that long summer is approaching afterwards. With Tenerife and Reading planned so far, it's gonna rock! (Subject to availability. Terms and conditions apply).  Speaking of Reading. Only about three months away. I can't waaaaaiiiiit. Gonna rock (hopefully). Just a few more great bands on the line-up and it's gonna be a rocking festival. So far on my 'must see' list are:  Lostprophets. Green Day. The Offspring. The White Stripes. Yellowcard. New Found Glory. Ash.  Reel Big Fish. Darkness (maybe). Dropkick Murphys. Placebo (maybe)  Should be great!  Gotta go though. Enjoy the rest of exams, fellow sufferers of the disease the doctors call... The G.C.S.E. They'll be over soon enough.  Laters.

      Yo. So this is my situation. The one and only Ollie is behind me, talking to Keith, who is absolutely shattered. Rachael is lying with him, and the three are having idle conversation about, well, erm, nothing. Ollie is now standing next to me. And looking at me. Is he trying to come onto me? I don't know. Nor do I want to. (He's stroking my shoulder now, by the way).  Benny boy is in the room next to us, playing the guitar (so what's new, holmes?). Playing the Pulp Fiction main song, pretty easy I heard. We're all amazingly talented. I bet we could out-solo Kirk Hammet and Slash at the same time, with our hands tied behind our back and humming the tune to thunderbirds/thundercats whilst on pogostick and/or those space hopper things, all the while atop a mountain, made of jelly (strawberry flavour). Ben agrees. Quite clearly.  Right, anyway, there are pissed grown-ups downstairs, talking about the size of bollocks. Umm... no really, you don't understand do you? They are, no kidding, talking about fucking bollocks. Did I mention that they were pissed? Out of their fucking mind? Oh wait.. I did. Mashed, they are. I'm surprised they're even talking. If you haven't guessed, we're at Keith's house. This is every-day stuff, you know.  So that's the situation. But, y'know, I've realised something tonight. Now, think about this for a minute. Where are we all gonna be in 10 years time? Working? Studying? That's all good, but will we know each other? For the first time it's coming clear that these next two years are the last we're gonna have together. Ok, fair enough, we'll keep in touch sometimes, speak on the phone, blah blah. But we won't be seeing each other day in, day out. And it's gonna suck. So what's my point? Well let's make the most of it, while we have it. There's a rocking summer ahead of us, let's not waste a god-damn moment of it.  Laters.

      I am in agonizing pain. My neck is so painful it's not even funny (how one can find pain funny is beyond me, to be honest). God only knows what position I slept in last night, but it was probably a painful one because when I woke up I only just managed to get out of bed. Since then I've been unable to move my neck to the left, unable to nod and unable to look directly up without sharp pains. It sucks. I just hope it goes brfore the big barbeque thingy magig at Emma's this afternoon/evening. Let's hope so.  In other news, or footballing news, by beloved West Ham are through to the Division 1 play-off final. Now, most of you don't really care about football (the only person in the group who I can think of who supports a team is Keith). However, I just have to mention that I am pretty damn happy over the result. We beat Ipswich 2-0, and should have scored more. Some players played outstanding and it was a real team effort. We won 2-1 on aggregate and now play Crystal Palace in the final for a place in the Premier League. Come on you Irons!  Aaaanyway, Study leave is coming along nicely. Unlike Will, I haven't been working my arse off for 6 hours a day. I couldn't do that if I tried. Instead, I'm doing about 2-3 hours a day. That way I can take more in and actually remember the stuff I've been revising. Little half-hour to an hour bursts are the best way. For me, anyway. You can revsise however you want, Maltan Man!  Not long now people. First exam on the 25th May - my German listening. Hope you're all revising hard.  Laters.

      Hey kids. Well what can I say? Been a rough week but it's been rounded off rather nicely. Firstly, school's finished. Well, compulsary education, that is. Although it is gonna be a long 5 or so weeks ahead of us, filled with exams and revising, it's still nice to know that I'll never,  ever  have to do another science lesson, another foreign language lesson or another maths lesson again. He he...  Also (or should I say auBerdem), I passed my German oral with flying colours. Well, maybe not that well. I'd say I passed it with stationary colours. Whatever the manner, my German teacher said that it was most probably an A. Add that to my potential A in the French oral, and things are looking good in the language department. Nice way to start off my exams. :)  Lastly, I handed in a reply slip and a deposit cheque which will allow me to go to Russia next year. The trip, which is part of the AS course, will be spread over 8 days. During the course of these 8 days I will have the opportunity to visit many historical places and see some of Russia's finest monuments. Should be a blast.  Now, before I go, just wanna make a shout-out to Keith who's had his last ever AGS school day. Been a kool year my friend, and may you find happiness in whatever you do... as cheesey as that sounds. *slaps self* G'luck in Scarborough.  S'all from me. Laters.

      Hey guys and gals. It's me.   Been a very rough week so far. All started at the weekend. On sunday a tradegy occured within the family as my grandad unfortunately died of a heart attack. He was a great man who always had a smile on his face and he will be dearly missed within the family. The funeral is on tuesday, and if it's anything like the last funeral I went to, it's gonna be a very sad day.   Anyway, if I have felt anti-social to anybody during any moment throughout the week, then I assure you it's nothing personal. I'm just pretty low at the moment. To those who have helped me throughout this, I thank you. Not only were you there for me when my cousin passed away, but you're also here for me now, and for that I thank you.   But I did have some good news during the week. My French oral went very well, and my teacher reckons that I got an A in it. That's a relief. I was worked up about that for aaages. Now I have my German one of friday. Damn.  That's all from me, folks.  Laters.

      Right, as I post this, I'm having a conversation with Dan Hughes-Morgan about swear words. But did you know, shit is not only the most versatile swear word, it's also the most versatlie word in the English Language.  But anyway, my assembly went well. I got a few laughs and I wasn't even shaking. I could even go as far as saying I wasn't even nervous. Result? I think I can finally say goodbye to the stage-fright that's been tortuting me for my whole life. *finally*  But then it'll probably come back on tuesday like an old Eastenders actor/actress past his or her best. Why so? My French oral on tuesday. Now even though I've learnt my presentation and questions off-by-heart, I think I'm gonna fail in the role-play. Ah well. It might turn out better than I think it will. Thing is, less than a week later is my German oral. Shite.  Moving on. Relationships. Aren't there just sooo many of them flying around at the moment? Not that it annoys me or anything, so rest assured love-birds, I'm just saying. I mean, every little social event I go to, whether it's up town or just round someone's house with a group of people, there are at least 2 or 3 couples there, and in large groups there can be up to 6. I mean, it does make me feel a little lonely sometimes. The buspark is full of them. But as I said, I'm not angry or jealous of it, so keep going with the love people. *raised thumb*  So why did I raise that little issue there? I dunno. I think the main reason is that I'm running out of things to talk about... already. Or maybe it's because the whole relationship side of my life is lacking at the moment. Whatever.  Dammit, I can hear the "booooooring" chants from my cyber audience now. Better talk about something interesting. Reservoir Dogs. This is a classic film. Anyone else who's seen it should sgree. Unless you don't like obscene violence and gore, of course. Now, although I prefer Pulp Fiction, I think that this is one of the best combinations of sickening violence and gore along with clever, witty dialogue in any film, ever. Just that moment when Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) is torturing the Police Officer is one of the greatest in all of film history. Well, that's my opinion anyway. Those of you who have not seen this film, I strongly recommend that you do.   Anyway, I think that's enough from me. Before I go, I leave you with these wise words.  'If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.'

      I'm bored. In general. Right now. At this stage of my life. I'm bored.  I don't know whether it's the depressing regime of revision which I kick-started during the week. Maybe it's just the whole prospect of exams, and the fact that they aren't providing much excitement. I dunno. But what am I getting at? I dunno, maybe I just need to do some stuff that'll make my life exciting. God knows what, but it has to be new. I mean, even watching The O.C. time after time can become repetitive. *sigh*  On top of that, this week's been crap. I'm not gonna go into a depreesive rant about how bad I've got it, but I'm just saying that it's been shit. I need cheering up. Wow, as I type this, England have just taken a wicket. Well that's a start.  In other news, I have an assembly to present on tuesday, and I  know  I'm gonna fuck it up. It involves comedy and stuff, and I don't do comedy. My form tutor just decided that I should do it. Still, I'll survive. I did an assembly once and it went smooth. A little too smooth for my liking. Hmmm.  I'm well into the fantasy novel I was going on about a few weeks back. I don't wanna publish it on the blog though. Don't ask why. But anyway, if you want to have a look in, email me and I'll send you the prologue and the first part of chapter 1. My address is godfather_2573@hotmail.com if you didn't know. You could also just ask me to send it to you through msn, if you like.  Advertisement over.  Anyway, that'll be all from me now. Laters.

      Well 'Tiger Tim' just beat 'The Scud'. Wow. Nicknames in Tennis sound so queer, eh?   Last exam today. Business studies. Whoo. The exam itself was actually pretty strange. Some questions not even on business studies. Like, ok, the last question. "John and Jane own a fish and chip shop. They decide to sponsor the town's school football team. Mrs. Jones, a parent, phones in to the school to express her concern. Why would Mrs. Jones be concerned over the issue?"  Anyway, I'm there, thinking 'when was I taught this?' I decide to give the 8 mark question a go with this answer: (well, roughly)  "Mrs. Jones may be concerned over the sponsorship deal because of the fact that the children are influenced in a negative way and are encouraged to eat the fish and chips. This would subsequently lead to health problems within the team, possibly resulting in weight problems. Not only would this affect the chidren, but it would also affect the school team, who's form would plunge due to all the overweight children playing for them"  Now, at this point, I ran out of time. If they'd have given me 5 minutes more, I would have gone on to say:  "Mrs Jones could very much be concerned by the dip in form of the school team. With overweight kids, the school team would have become the laughing stock of the nation! And what mother would want her child playing for such a terrible team? How could she face up to the social eye of being a parent of a child who plays in a rubbish football team? I say Mrs. Jones has every right to express her concern! Lead the way, Mrs. jones! Fight the system! Ban the fish and chip shops! All of them! *trail off*"  Ok, maybe not. But I was thinking that this could be one of those questions that you don't actually take seriously. History has many of those.   Moving on. Ahhh! 10 weeks of nothing? Jeez, I'm actually gonna be bored. Need a job. Need to boost the social life again. I need to wake up! 'Why don't you get a job?' say The Offspring. I might just have to. I'm boooooored already.  Anyway, this weeks recommendation is Sugarcult - Palm trees and Power lines. their fourth album. Not quite as amazing as Start Static though. Anyway, if you see a Sugarcult album, and you're undecided on what to buy, get that album. You won't regret it.  Anyway, good on ya Tim. Through to the quarter final. I think he's due to play Federer in the semi-final, should he win. Looks like it's another year without him making the final. Damn.  Talk to you fine readers another time.  Laters.

      Bon soir, mes amis. Though it is not evening yet, I felt like speaking French. It'll probably be the last time I ever do. C'est fantastique, non? C'est grande... aw shit.   Anyway, only one more left. Yup, only one more member of the biology teaching staff left to kill. The last one proved quite tricky, what with all the snakes and military vehicles. Also, the bloody gun didn't work. Last time I buy anything from Millets.  Oh, hang on. Not supposed to disclose that information. Umm, oo, err, it's all Ward's fault! He hypnotised me! Oh no, here he is again. No Ward, I told you to stay away! *punch* *kick in stomach* *runs away* *throws grenade*  He'll only be back later.  Umm... Anyway. I was of course referring to exams. I had history today. America outline study. I think I was like one of the few people in the room who actually knew was McCarthyism was. I didn't actually know that well, though. About some guy who had a list of supposed communists. People on the list got visits from the government. The least said about that the better. Anyway, American communist party gets banned, tensions between America and Russia become worse. Also, this McCarthy dude actually qualifies for the communist list himself, but doesn't get in trouble. He was a member of the government, after all.  And so another pointless fact on My Own Project MayhemÂ comes to a close. Not much mayhem going on around here, eh?  Anyway, the moral of the story? Don't be a hypocritical, contradictory bastard. Or bitch, for you female readers. Or Teh n00b, for you l33t people.  Before I leave, just a recommendation for you guys to buy Yellowcard's album - Ocean Avenue. Pretty damn rocking. As Raz would agree.  Laters.

      Hello my minions. Or am I a minion to you guys? I forget. Anyway, how have we all been? Good, you good. Ah, you're not so good, eh? Nevermind, can only get better. Woosh.  Exams are coming to an end. So that's good. 10 weeks of no school draws upon us. That's great. No pressure of school or exams. Guys, I think everyone will agree when I say things are gonna get better. But one draw back? We won't see each other pretty much everyday. Still, we'll do our best for our social get togethers, eh?  Moving on. Baddiel and Skinner. Does anyone watch their fantasy football program on ITV1 some evenings. It's on at 10 p.m. when it is on. I think it's pretty damn good. When Baddiel and Skinner are together it's comedy genius. (Their 'Baddiel and Skinner: Unplanned' series was brilliant) Anyway, for those who haven't seen this fantasy football lark, it's basically the two of them talking about the past few football matches that have taken place in Euro 2004. Guests and footballing icons appear on the show every night, and (of course) they'res Statto. Kool!  I thought it was brilliant in their piss take of the Blazin' Squad. Talking about football songs, the topic of the Squad, innit, doing a song for England came up. The debate of how to pronounce Blzin Squad developed into pure class. Went something like this:  Guest: No, you gotta say it with real ghetto. Like 'Bu-lazinn' Sssquad-a Baddiel: But what's with that hand sign? Guest: Oh that's just what they do. Like, y'know, 'safe' and 'innit'. Bu-lazin' Sssquad-a, innit. Baddiel: Right, so it's Bu-lazin' Squad. Gues: No, more rolling and lisp sounding. Baddiel: Oh right, ok.  .::About 5 or so minutes later::.  Baddiel: Okay, so what was the song that Da Buuuuuuh-lahahahahazingaa Ssssssquaddera were gonna do like, then?  I dunno, you had to be there to laugh out there. Just the fact that they were taking the piss out of the townie image as a whole was good enough for me.  I recommend that you go watch. Even if you're not a football fan, you'll get a few laughs from it.  In other news, I completed level 9 on 'Bounce' - a game on my Mum's mobile phone. It's pretty damn addictive. Basically, you're this balloon who's been doomed to wandering around various mazes and courses for the rest of its life. To complete the level, you must go through rings to open the big vault door, as well as collecting bonuses on the way. But wait! It's not that easy! There are various spikes and big-ass moving blocks to stop you in your path. They're there to, quite literally, deflate your journey. However, all is not in vain! You can cunningly avoid these obstacles and thus ply your way through to the next maze.  The mazes get harder as you go through them. Poor bastard of a balloon has to keep going. Or die. Or just sit there. Like a plonker.  Laters.   p.s. Cheers for all the feedback on my little article style thing about America. I thank you for your kind words of praise, but also for the debate that you've brought to the site. So Emma, Mike, Hattie, Ward and others, Ta. Seriously, it was kool. :)

      Let's be honest here. I'm tired about writing about me and I'm sure all you people are tired of hearing about me. I'm in exams so what I have to say about myself would be very boring. So I'm gonna talk about other issues. These issues are mostly George W. Bush, Americans and World Politics in General. Just don't get too bored. You might be interested. Also, if you already know the facts here, then I apologise. I just wanted to have them posted.   It’s long blog update, guys. If you don’t have the will power to read it all, then fine, whatever. But I ask you nicely, read it to just know the facts. You might be surprised.   November 7, 2000   It's the American Presidential elections. All the polls closed on that day and a new President would be elected for sure. Clinton had resigned and the two main candidates were George Bush Jnr. and Al Gore, Bush being a Republican and Gore being a Democrat. Ralph Nader was lingering behind them in the process, but his main role was to give Gore votes, not to actually win the election himself. Anyway, on that night Al Gore won the elections. Hardly a landslide but he won. By receiving 539,898 more votes than Junior he won. Long live The President of the United States of America - Albert Gore.  Wait; hold on, something isn't right. Last I hear Al Gore wasn't President of the U.S of A. Last I heard it was the "Thief in Chief" George Junior. But Gore won, right? So why does Double-Ya occupy the White House along with all his cronies and Dicks... Cheney? Well I'll tell you.  “A very American Coup”. That’s how Michael Moore puts it. (Do note that I’m taking most inspiration and information from his books and films, added with my viewpoints) It all started in the State of Florida. I doubt that most of you know what the political situation was (and still is) in Florida. Hell neither did I before I read some of Moore’s writing.   The Governor of Florida is Jeb Bush. That’s George Bush Senior’s son, and likewise, Junior’s brother.  Along with the help of his “Hired Muscle,” he managed to commit a huge fraud in the voting system. Know it or not, the vast majority of African Americans in the state of Florida are Democrats. Gore received ninety percent of their vote in the November 7th elections. But what did Jeb do? Months proceeding, he and Katherine Harris, co chairwoman of Bush’s Presidential campaign, paid $4 million to ‘Database Technologies’ to remove any suspected of being a former felon from the voting rolls. But of course, there were Republican voters in the state of Florida. No good denying them the vote, eh? So the focus of this denial was on the black population of Florida. So, in unfair circumstances, 31 percent of all black men in the State of Florida were unable to vote on November 7th.  They didn’t stop there, though. They had to get rid of potential Gore voters, so went on to another level. People with similar names to former felons were denied the vote. People who had the same birth date of someone who’d been caught stealing a bottle of coke from a supermarket (or grocery store, whatever) were denied the vote. Teeny, tiny similarities such as social security codes, addresses, etc were taken into account, and before anyone knew it, 173,000 voters were culled from the voter rolls.   So, as people flocked to the voting booths on November 7th, a huge amount of people, the vast majority being black people, were turned away and were not allowed the vote. Police were hired to stop any of these barbaric ex “criminals” from voting.  So that was the controversy of the Florida election. If you cast your mind back to the election night and remember the constant recounts in Florida, blah blah, that was why.   Anyway, recounts were demanded by Gore. The recounts went on for a couple days, taken place in the Supreme Court by its fair and just members. On November 9th, it was revealed that the overall tally of the recount showed that Gore was catching up fast with Bush, and was most certainly going to catch up. “Shit,” was what Bush was most likely thinking at that time. Bush and his Buddies only had one option. The Supreme Court, much in support of Junior, stopped the recount during the afternoon, falsely declaring that Bush had still won it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA! Hold on, Supreme Court in favour with a party? That’s not allowed! That’s evidence of a biased viewpoint! Harrumph! Well, if no one found out then…psst…no one will know. The whole scandal was that two of the primary members of the Supreme Court, who were appointed in the Nixon era, thought that if they retired at their ripe old age under Republican rule, their ideas and viewpoints would not be under threat and their way of rule would continue with fresh Republican members of the Supreme Court.  Now isn’t that selfish?    George W. Bush Jnr.   When asked what his favourite childhood was, George Bush Junior gave a nice big smile and answered “The Very Hungry Caterpillar.” Good choice, Mr President. Just one little problem. The Very Hungry Caterpillar wasn’t actually published until a year after you graduated from your College years. Whoops.   The President of the United States of America should not actually be the President of the United States of America. 1) Because he got there on fraud. 2) Because he is not fit to be a President of the United States of America. Here’s a little run through of his… incapability.  1) It is rumoured that Bush takes naps during his day which can last from 1-2 hours. It is also rumoured that he ends his working day at 4.30 pm. These rumours were confirmed when angry co workers lashed out at him using the effective tool that is the media.   2) It has been said that Bush is an illiterate. (First proof of this lies with the Very Hungry Caterpillar situation. See above.) Also, there’s the big college issue. How could he have got into places such as Yale if he was an illiterate? To be quite frank about the whole thing, it was because his surname was Bush. His SATs (not our brand) were lower than many other applicants who failed to get a spot in one of the most prestigious places of education in the U.S of A.  Also, many a detective has come to the conclusion that the transcripts that he wrote during college were not his own.  Also, as the TV programme ‘Dead Ringers’ regularly states, Junior doesn’t seem to have a grasp on the English language. Now, it’s not as serious as him saying made up words such as ‘Deployerise’ and whatnot, but his constant tendency to muddle up words in speeches is worrying. May it be reminded that this is the guy who could blow up the world with a touch of a button! Jeez Louise.  3) Bush is an alcoholic. (Disclaimer: May not actually be true. If anyone asks, you didn’t hear it from me. Tell them Ward said it) Though, in all technicality, he has admitted it. Not directly, but he has said that he “cannot handle drinking” and that it was “beginning to crowd out his energies and affections for other people.” Aren’t those signs of a true alcoholic?   In 1976, Bush was arrested for drink driving. Bush denies being arrested that night, and laughed the incident off as a crazy moment back in his youth. Firstly, he was in fact arrested. He spent a couple of hours in custody in a nearby station. Second, by laughing the incident off, he is claiming that endangering the life of him, the passenger and other drivers is a ‘crazy moment’. Thirdly, labelling it a crazy moment in his youth is not on. He was in fact in his thirties.   4) Bush has claimed that he has committed no felonies in the last twenty-nine years. That’s nice to hear. A clean man for nearly thirty years. Since 1974 the most powerful man in the world has not committed a crime. But what about before 1974? It has been said that the “President” once possessed cocaine, a drug which can result in life imprisonment. Also, Bush has been arrested for stealing back in his younger days, and he was also taken downtown for disorderly behaviour at an American Football game.   So is George a good President? Does he know what he’s doing? As Zoë and Ben like to say, does the Pope shit in the woods?   The United States of America!   Right, enough about me slagging off one American. Time for me to slag the whole lot off. Well… maybe not. Just to clarify, I love Americans. When I went over a couple of years ago (Happy days. Just ask Will) I found the Americans to be very nice people, who as a whole welcomed us Brits with open arms. Striking up conversation with them was always nice, and I can’t remember one rude or snobbish American while I stayed there. Consider the fact we were there for 9 days and around them all the time, I think that’s quite impressive. So American People = good. (On the whole)  Way that America is run and its policies = bad. Here’s a little list of Government policies and negative effects that are buggering up American society and the world as a whole:  •	America is the Number One country in terms of firearm deaths each year.  •	America has the highest amount of beef production. •	America is the Number One producer of toxic waste. Germany comes second with 1/20 of what America produces. •	America releases more Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. More than Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Brazil, India and Indonesia.  Combined.  •	America consumes more oil and natural gas than any other nation. •	America is the country who has more deaths and injuries involving road accidents than any other. •	Children in America are more likely to die by gunfire in America compared to any other. •	America still has racial problems, with the average income for black people being 61 percent less than the average income for white people. •	In 2001, 163 schools in New York opened without a guy in charge. (they call them “principals” over there) Furthermore, a third of schools in Washington in that same year were deemed unsafe. •	America spends more on its military than any other nation.  America the best country in the world? America the land of the free? Decide for yourself.  So why am I bothered? I’m a Brit. Why should I care? To be honest, having an illiterate, who doesn’t quite understand his job, hang his finger over the big red button scares me. Having a country that produces a hell of a lot more Carbon Dioxide than a load of other countries put together scares me. Having a country that manages to con its beloved people into having a stupid, fucking, dumb-arse, ex-felon twat as President scares me. If you’ve read up to this point, then thanks guys. I appreciate it. It took a while to write.  Laters   *The inspiration and statistics for this was taken from a lot of Michael Moore’s work. I am a huge admirer of Moore and believe that this guy knows more sense than any Bush, Clinton or Gore ever will. I highly recommend that you read his books and watch his films. You’ll enjoy ‘em. Peace out.

      Long time no Wassum. So, how about a little update on my life? Or more precisely my exams. Had the science exam on Monday. That was far better than how I thought it was gonna be. So that was all good.   The came maths. The first question was 2x5, so at that point I was thinking 'Yess, get in.' However, it just got harder and harder and harder. I didn't do bad or anything. But the last third of the exam was pretty evil. Still have the calculator exam to do. Fuck. Best revise for that one.  Then today, I had French listening. That was painfully easy. Y'see I opted to do foundation listening, mainly because I  hate  listening exams. But judging by the simplicity of this morning's exam, maybe higher wasn't so difficult after all? Who knows? The people who did it, most probably...  Tomorrow I have English language (my favourite of the lot) followed by a trip to the cinema. Planning to watch The Day after tomorrow, tomorrow (would've been more clever yesterday). Anyway, should be fun. The whole prospect of the world being torn apart is appealing to me. Also the fact that the world doesn't survive is cool. I've heard that it's literally the End of the World. Mother Nature 1. People of Earth 0. No American heroes to save the day. That's it. That is originality for ya.  On Friday it's German reading/writing. Providing I revise it should be alright. Let's hope so.  To all those going to the cinema tomorrow, I'll see you then. Everyone else, I'll see y'all whenever.  Laters.

      Science sucks! I hate it with a passion. I actually despise the subject so much I'd rather do 30 maths exams that 3 science exams. For fuck fuckity fucking sake. Fuck.   Well, fucking aside, it's been an ok half term. I got my hair cut, but no doubt it'll all be long and crazy in a couple of days. There comes a point where my hair grows to a length where it's absolutely perfect. Problem is, that stage only lasts for about three days. Then it grows, and grows, and grows. Then it'll grow some more. It's retarded. Regardless, none of you people have permission to touch it. You know what my reaction is when you try and mess it up. I'll hunt you down with a Tommy gun, I will.*  Well, my life. It's feeling pretty empty at the moment. Exams aren't helping, but then I'm kinda sensing that's not the problem. Something's missing. I'm bored. I have a whole summer to quench that boredom (complicated words are kool!) but I don't wanna wait through a whole month of exams first. Grr. I think I know what I could do to solve it, but I don't wanna say. Putting my deepest thoughts onto this blog would kill us all. Well, not all of us. I might survive. Ward's in with a chance, and it looks as if Ben could survive anything. But as for the rest of you, you'd all be screwed.  But does anyone else have that feeling? the sense that something's missing? I wonder if I'm the only one. *thinks* *winces* Thinking hurts.  Anyway, just  82 days, 3 hours and 8 minutes   till Reading. Not long now. Everyone who's going shout "Yeah!" when you read this. If you're not going, then I sympathise.  Better be going.  Laters.  *may not actually be true. Just remember though, touch the hair and I won't be best pleased.

      Séances. Did anyone catch Derren Brown’s live (or maybe not) séance last night? Started at 10:35 p.m. on Channel 4 (no, Big Brother wasn’t on at that time). Well, gotta say that I was totally convinced until the end (until the part where the man himself revealed that it was in fact an illusion by calling out the ‘spirit’ who was in fact a real person). Still, the event was totally believable, and the members of the public who took part were also convinced as well. If you didn’t see it, the looks on their faces were of total shock and horror. The part, for example, where they had to focus on one student from a group of 12 and practically all of them focused on the same picture was quite a shock for them. More so when the ‘spirit’ spelt her name out using the wine glass and letters. The name, which incidentally was Jane, was the name of the student which they all had focused on.  The séance itself took place in an old college where, so the story goes, 13 students took part in a pact suicide together in 1974. They all died save one, the ring leader, who survived and moved to Australia shortly afterwards. Ironically he died in a car crash about a year or so after moving there. Anyway, so Derren Brown, the illusionist (can’t stress this enough people) decided to pick 12 members of the public to take part in a séance to try and make contact with the students, whether it be one of them or more. Derren Brown doesn’t actually believe in spiritualism, he simply wanted to do it as he was interested to see what would happen.   So they carried it out, with the whole ‘using someone as a median’ and gaining contact through her. They (or Derren, whatever) were talking to this ‘Jane’ person through this girl who had been randomly chosen and they were randomly talking to her at different stages at her life. All the while the other people are in a circle - scared shitless – listening to this conversation between ‘Jane’ and Derren. Derren asks Jane to leave, and it’s the end of the séance. The people, who look white and scared, see a video of Jane’s life apparently sent in by a family member. The Derren leaves, goes outside, and opens a van, out steps an actress bearing an exact resemblance to ‘Jane’. That’s the point where everyone realises that it was an illusion and a psychological thing. It was amazing, and it maintains my belief that Derren Brown is far more impressive than, oo, what’s that twat’s name? David Blaine!   Anyway, that was the séance for those who missed it. It really was amazing and you should shoot yourself if you missed it (or if you’re not up for killing yourself, a ‘shit’ would be fine).   I thought this would be a change from me going on about my life. Just to clarify, I’m not really up for a séance. Just warning you.

       Ola. I'm in Tenerife. Yes, Tenerife, the Canary Island off the coast of Morroco.  It's so kool it's put me in a... no, can't accept it.... It's put me in a... urgh. A good mood! The sun is a shining and the weather is sweet. And I've only been here about two days.   Originally I had this whole update on relationships to give you. But the bastard like internet at home kinda screwed that up for me. Yeah, cheers. No worries. Nothing overly insulting. Anyway, instead you get a nice little update about my tenerife life. Here it is:  I've sat by the pool and relaxed.  And that's all folks. See you all in about 2 weeks. All you D of E'ers - I hope you're having a grand old time.  Adios.

      Ward is making me update my blog again. Fine, I succumb to your demands, but for the last time, I am not blogging about MC Hawking. Right.  Instead of going on about how I slept till about 11 this morning, cycled to Quainten, came back, watched Neighbours and then played Mafia till about now, I'll talk about something else. But I can't find anything to talk about. But then no one would give a fuck anyway, so I might as well blog about the first thing I see. Well, I'm updating my blog, so why not that? I'm  looking  at the moniter, so it's the first thing I  see.  So I'll write some crap about updating blogs.  Why do we do it? Back in the day it was Ben, Keith, Zoe, Raz and Emma. That was the "community" of blogs. They blogged about their daily lives while one of the others would come along and post a comment, or a shout out, as they were then. It was a good life for the Famous 5. But then it turned all pear shaped. Everyone else started creating blogs. Everyone else found out about the wonderfullness (may or may not be a real word) of talking mindlessly about what they did at school and what teachers they all had grudges against. (My preference is Mr. Pilkington) Yes, we all came along and joined in the complaining of how crap our lovelifes were or in the bragging about how we were getting some. Before we knew it, nearly everyone had a blog. Hell, even a group blog came along. Talk about Cr@zY.   I'm one of the culprits, fair enough. I came along in March (still a newbie, I suppose) and started M.O.P.M. During that time I've made just one constructive post, which only about 6 people bothered to read. All the rest have been bitchy posts (a lot like this one, really) without much of a meaning. So I'm thinking 'what's the point?' Why do we post blog updates? I mean, it's all the same really. Ok, Ben and Keith have done some excellent shorts, Emma wrote a cracking story a couple months back and Tom Salieri (haha, Ward, see what I did there?) does some articles that prove to be entertaining. Apart from that, it's all posting about one's merry/fucked up//fairly average/*add depressing adjective here* day. Well, I'll tell you the point.  It's an addiction. A craving. A need. People need to inform. People need to tell, to analyse, to describe, to review. They can do this via blog. An explanation that my imaginative mind conjured up is that you post an update, you attract an interest, people leave about 30 odd comments and you feel good about yourself. You do it again, attracting another 20 odd comments. Oooh, loving this. Perhaps the blog is a nice way of venting out your angry, morbid feelings. Doesn't matter if no one else gives a fucking rat's arse, you still got it out. And you can relax. Or, if you really wanna be psycological, a blog is something you have control of. I noticed the other day that I can delete any comment I like on my blog, because it's MINE! ALL MINE! An insulting comment? Ha! Bow down to me, or your view will be terminated! My blog, my rules. I can already see American Presidency in the horizon.   Moving on, I envy people for the amount of popularity they gain for their blog. Writing two paragraphs, talking about some obscure subject may seem boring. But they still bring in about 20 comments. How? I'm not jealous. I just envy them, or rather, their ability to rake in the popularity for whatever reason. (Oh, never because every member of the opposite sex fancies you, or because your blog has bright colours. Never ever ever)  This may sound like a resignation. Nah, it'll all be bog standard again by this time next week. Just trying to open everyones eyes, or something. I've nothing against blogging. If I did, mischiefmayhemsoap.blogspot.com would not exist. It's what people blog that mystifies me. *shrugs* Shine on, you crazy diamonds.  Also, if you've been offended by this, then you deserve to be. Oooh, controversial. Well, no, not really.   Before I scram, I'll let you in on a little insight. Today I ruled cities and countries alike with an iron fist.  Then i got bored and just played SimCity again.   Badum...   ...Wait for it...   Tsshh.

      A lot has happen over the last 6 days. Not to me, personally, but in the world. Saddam Hussein faced trial in Iraq. Still claimed he was in charge. Was laughed at. Another Muslim cleric who promotes suicide bombings and whatnot was welcomed into Britain with open arms. 'Can't be worse than Abu Hamza' people thought. We'll see. America had their Independence Day. No one in this country gave a shit. Except for all the Americans living or staying here, I suppose. Still, Roddick lost the Wimbledon final on July 4th. Mwaha.  Still, a lot of change took place in the sporting world. Roger Federer defended his Wimbledon title. He probably cried... again. Foolish Swiss. Also, the lovely Maria Sharapova (ooh, even saying the name makes my knees go weak) won the women's title. She was born in the same year as me, y'know. Interesting. Erm, yeah, err. Moving on…  Greece is the best country in Europe. Football, that is. Bloody Greeks. They're not a real football team. A lot like West Ham, you might say. Wasn't the best of games. (The one against Portugal, that is) They'll enjoy their moment of glory then bugger off again. Probably.  Went to see Shrek 2 yesterday. Oh, it was great. So many great characters, so many brilliant references, and brilliant one liners that anyone could enjoy. However, one character beats them all. 'Donkey?' Nah. 'The Ginger Bread Man?' I think not. 'Prince Charming?' Now you're being silly! I am of course referring to...  Puss… in Boots  The Latino, sword-wielding cat easily steals the show. He’s just brilliant. Antonio Banderas voices him superbly, and the whole cheesiness of him just adds to the humour.    Anyway, the film itself is brilliant, and I urge you all to go see it. *thumbs up*  And so there goes another pointless update. Before I go, I bought various shares in caffeine companies the other day. I drank the profits.  (haha)  Laters.

      "Today, I changed. It's too late, cause every town feels the same. I'm different. And you're distant. Add it up and it makes no difference. Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood, everybody's gonna break it up today. Everybody's talking about blowing up the neighborhood. Runnin' just to get away."   Sugarcult - Stuck in America   I love that song. I'm really in the Sugarcult mood right now. Great band.   Anyway, spent most of my day sleeping and sodding around doing nothing. Dialled various recruitment lines and was told to "check their websites". I did for T K Maxx and I was told fuck all. Thanks for that. Also tried to get in touch with Currys, Homebase and Safeway. No shit about Safeway. A job's a job. Still, I'll work in a supermarket but never McDonald's. I try not to stoop that low.   Disclaimer: If any of you readers work in McDonald's or any Fast food restaurants, then I apologise. Not! Haha! No real disclaimer for you!   Knowing my luck I'll be working there in a week's time. *sigh*  Anyway, a topic of conversation. Hmm, let me see. Henman's out. No surprise there. Euro 2004 semi-final tonight. The Czech republic and Greece. No one will give a shit, then. Cricket? Nah, everyone who reads this (all 5 of you)  hate  cricket. I'm getting the impression that sport isn't popular at the minute.  So, where are we all going on holiday, then? Me, I'm going to the sunny island of Tenerife. Went last year as well. Was quite the laugh actually. Met new people, hung out on the beach, played pool in the evening, watched the entertainment in the bar. Was actually not bad at all, so I'm expecting much the same this year. The highlight of it last year was a place called Wigan Peer. Basically, it's a place owned by this guy, and by day he lives his normal life in tenerife. Goes to the beach, goes shopping, whatever. Been living in Tenerife for a few years (he's British, y'see). He owns a successful bar. Lifes quite good.  By night, he does a comedy show at the bar. He dresses up as a woman, he sings, tells jokes, and insults people, including the audience. He goes by the alias of 'Crystal Star' and he's damn ruthless. He insults Germans. People from the North of England. (Scousers mainly) Overweight people. Skinny people. Teenagers. Old people.  The basic impression is that you really can't win with him.  Anyway. You guys know the deal with my hair. In truth, it's ridiculous. Not that it's a bad thing, but it's a joke. Well, Crystal Star did pick up on that. Back then I had my Elvis quiff thing going on. She... or he, whatever, said some bad things. Normally when someone insults my hair, I insult the bastard back. But oh no. I just sat there, totally defenceless, while a room full of about 50 odd people sat there and laughed at me. 'Just wait till it's you turn,' I thought to them. I sat there and smiled while he went on with his onslaught.  We should be going again this year. I'll redo my quiff. Just for him.   Anyway, here's a chance for you guys to post your holiday adventures. Humiliating? Exciting? Best thing in your life? We wanna know! Answers on a postcard. Or maybe in the comment part.  Laters.
