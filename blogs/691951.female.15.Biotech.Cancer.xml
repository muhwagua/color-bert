       ooo...i felt lyke postin a poem...4m a guy @ aim high...mike chan...aka semi-david!!!!! =P  -=The Poetic Mind=-  So the poetry in my mind keeps shifting like the sands of time exactly the time before I ever say, "no son of mine..." mine what? blowing up fields of emotion in order to spread thin like lotion over a promotion not worth demanding.  So began my journey to attack at ease I spend my dreams writing rhymes wiykd sometimes come off my mind too quickly enough to write the down so I find myself pressing rewind as I resign to the past...I've come down... There's this need to find a place called home somewhere within my dome so I Rome like the coliseum, largely unknown but politically prone, my eyes sown shut by the needle of revelation, a revelation stationed at a murderer's gate, has my mind blocked off like yellow police tape searching for bait to attract myself away   far away to this magnate, even more relaxed state      like a pair of Lee's jeans putting on one lobe of my mind on at a time           I patiently design a structure, made to withstand one thought after another               until what is uncovered is the strength of a brother     the kind of way lovers hover over each other in an endless summer                       but what i discover is something ungoverned.  wowee!!!!!!  long poem!!!  isnt it kewl though?

NO1 has kept in touch, even though everyone has written *KIT* all over their frend's yearbook. september - we go 2 high school!!!!!  were freshmans and we get our first 2.0... december - we finally wonder about each other in other high schools.  we actually remember each other's birthdays, though were not exactly *frends* nemore.  no presents, just cuz everyones broke.   and thats wut r lives are gonna be like...next year.  my sister hasnt kept in touch with barely ne of her frends at lowell...except at the lowell dances

AH!!!! all the people in the algebra 2 class (i like to call it *special algebra class*) are going to lowell except jessica t.  which is so sad cause she wanted to go 2 lowell but her mom put linc as her first choice..   the koolest thing that could happen when we're in high school is go to the games and see each other!!!!  i mean, i could see connie in the bleachers being a basketball manager, with coutrney there next to her. =D lets all go to high school games!!!!!! *big yawn*   hahaha...i was watching liberty kids this morning for lucero and i think i watched it wrong or something, because all i remember is ben franklin being more popular than king loui III...and kindg loui was jealous.  and someones daughter had small pox, but was cured by franklin's vaccine.  i like the litte *commercial* things when they have this *LNN* LOL...i think its supposed to be a CNN thing.  hah!!  but its cute because they have this *guess that person* and for hamilton (the guys name) they had a picture of a ham!!!!!! =D its so cute and im actually learning something!!!!!!

       u know how sometimes the gym doors are opened before school?  well..once this gurl went into the gym, and climbed up the platform thing (on top of where the teachers store the free-play balls), rite next to the windows, and tied a rope around her neck, and walked off of the platform.  she hung herself..  so  never  go into the gym by yourself because the gurl's ghost is still there....thats why the gym doors arent open there anymore....

       how do you think you did on the star-9s?  i think i did horrible because i kinda finished last in the whole class except one other person.  then i was checking my work, and mr. stannard thought i was still taking my test, so he went up to me and asked *are you done?*  >.<  lol....then clarissa opened her coke can rite in the middle of testing, and mr. stannard just took it from her and let her have it at the end.  lol. luckily we didnt have ms. prak!!!!!!!  ..and the strangest thing...one moment i was looking at mr. stannard walk around the room, and the next time i looked it was ms. puttnam.  *weird*  that happened in mr. cunningham's room too!!!!!

(poor 7th graders!!!!!) lol...our grade always likes to max out on the marriage booth =D rings  and  papers. =) what did i do at the fair?  ate a million of those free-bee conversation hearts that the booths gave out for trying, got married with 4 people (though 1 marriage is a BIG COMMITMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and got adopted by two people.  EEWwwww...tim wanted me and nicky to get married and have a kid.  INTERBREEDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!  thats just   nasty!!!!!   *shivers*   our party for 7th period wasnt that kool..none of the hyper ppl were there, and there was too much food.  nobody elses xtra credit for cunningham really worked (well..the ball dropped out 3 times) and he took mine!  oui.  o well..i think that was part of the deal.  lol...luckily amir didnt bring his famous rock-hard brownies!!!!!! (no offense..)  and we didnt go easter egg huntin because of CARTERS GYM CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!  *out of 30 eggs, my next class could only find 9* aww...and the 8 of us (yes, everyone was either at the fair or cutting or tardy) were all looking forward to it!!!!!!!!!!  =/ o well..theres next year?  they dunt have *spring-a-ling-a-ding*s at lincoln...they dunt even throw parties the way that mr. cunningham throws em!!!! =( next years gonna be...*arrrgghh*

       ...i looked into the mirrior, and i saw myself sitting in a red graduation gown.  my hair was in a bun, and i wore a smile.  but something seemed missing in 3-year chapter of my life, though i reached all of my goals.  so i guess there was a goal that i didnt stick into my head that i had forgotten about, but all of the sudden bugged me, on June 4th, 2003.  i felt a need to go back, and accomplish my important goal.  but how can you reach a goal, without knowning what it is?

ARRggghhh.....   so today was the picnic!!  and i hope i get my pics developed tomorrow!!! =D it was  reli  cold in the morning... and my teeth were chattering!! lol.  but it  gradually  got warmer, but not that sunny for me to get a tan. =(  well anywais... the swimming was kinda kool, because the water was warmer than it was outside, and it did go kinda deep.  but all the immature bois kept on splashing and it was really annoying.. and *EEW!!* i found a ban-dae in the pool too!!! >. something .. and its not like there was no roof, either.     LOL!!!!!!!  and at the beginning of the picnic, all these guys were lined up by the fence just staring at the gurls in swimming suits!  lol!  (= im kinda glad i wasnt one of those gurls in the first round of swimming...  eeww!  there were all these lito bugs that went into my food twice!!  it was  so  gross...  i dunt see the point of wearing a swim suit if your not going to swim.  yes, theres tanning, but thats all!!    lolz!!  on the bus, the driver turned the radio station to 106.1, then beaven starts singin to it.. "lets raise the windows!!! *pushes arms in air* " " oh  yea!!!  lets raise the emergency break!!! " LOL!!!!!!!!!!  one of those *all time favorite joke* things =D   we start graduation practice tomorrow!!  i think ms. pon's gonna be in a bad mood.  well, shes always in a bad mood.  but especially in a bad mood cause were probably her worst class ever.  most of us are good, but its the rest of em that makes us all look bad..  only another 4 more days!!!!!!

       so today was a bad day.. i woke up early for some reason..at 8!!!!!  and i coodnt fall asleep because i think id suffercate, from my stuffy nose!  then i looked outside and it looked kinda of rainy and foggy at the same time.. lol.  so i tried going back to sleep for about 30 mins, and i just sat up and read... and thought *hey!  its saturday morning and i didnt sleep in!!*  so i turn on the TV and flip the channels to 7.. lizzie mcguire!  then rugrats, and bugs bunny, and roli polli oolie... *sigh* i felt like a 3rd grader, and i wish i were.. then i woodnt have to deal with all that high school stuff, and i member we got a party every single holiday!!!  lol.  or usually.. and we had actual celebrations rather than watching science or history videos!  haha.  but then agen, 5 years later in school is a lot more fun!!  =)  having different teachers rather than one, and music every day! (not exactly *joy to the world* material, if ur in orchestra with me) but the music was better, i think, cuz most of us were into spice gurls, BSB, and n*sync! =) all the kool pop music.  and no1 criticized you, or otherwise the teacher would give you a chatisement or something.  awww...the good ole` days =)

       the 8th grade dance was...better than the winter one.  enough sed.   koolio!!!!  56 ppl signed my yearbook...more than ever!!     so i see you fellow 8th graders for another day, and THATS IT.  which means...i hope i see you guys in college!!!!!  cuz most of us probably wont keep in touch, unless we yum cha every week or so!!  hehe.  so different paths, different routes, different ideas of succeeding, different places to go, different lives, different schools......=(  why do they group us all together?  i mean, lowell pretty much shunns all of the *mentally challenge* ppl away, SOTA shunns ne1 that duznt know how to play an instrument/draw/write/be artistic away, linc sends anyone away from their neighborhood, SI only accepts catholic ppl to their school, etc etc...  so in many ways, their telling us to pick the ppl we hang out with carefully, and pretty much leave the ppl that arent wutever BEHIND.  and those kids, sadly, go to all of the bad schools.. =( and a lot of my frends are going there to!!!!!! =(

LOL.  eh, i guess it wasnt that easy.  oh, and another easy question if you were in my classin 6th grade: the taj mahal is in which asian country that organizes its citizens in a strict Caste system?*   a question that made me confused..*what is the world's largest island that is not a continent?  a) long island   b) australia c) tahiti  d) greeland is greenland part of canada?  i have NO idea... long island, i dunt think so...australia, thats a continent..tahiti?  i just member seeing a nice resort on TV with a glass table, and you could see the fish swimming underneat.  lol.  once agen, is greenland a country?  or is it part of canada...and  is  it an island?!?!?!??!??!?

       happy birthday erica!!!!  yesterday we celebrated her berfday for the 14th time on the 4th of july!  i guess you cood call it a family tradition.  their backyard has like 3 levels (on a hill) so it has a nice view =)  you can see the fireworks pretty good, cept there's this darn tree there now!!!!  o well.  too bad the san mateo fireworks were cancelled this year-you can usually see those really well from where they are.  LOL..on top of the hill, i cood hear some lito kid neighbors going *oOo!!!  Ahhhh..* to every single firework thingy!!!!!!!!  kinda cute, but it got annoying after a while..   the best part about her b-day, was we roasted marshmellows over the grill =D!!  so fun, and we made smores in the hot weather.  haha..her aunt lit a marshmellow on fire, then ATE it!!!!!  it was SOO nasty cuz it was all black. *cringe cringe*   lol!!  a conversation my sister had with a typical cheerleader that you wood stereotype on::  typical cheerleader:  so..what high school do you go to?  my sister:  lincoln  TC:  what city is that in?  sister:  san francisco  TC:  so...thats in berkeley, rite?  sister:  *looks at gurl funny* no, thats in san francisco.  TC:  oh.  then how do you get here?  sister:  we take the BART  TC:  whats *BART*?  sister:  *walks away*    LOL!!!!!  those are the kind of cheerleaders that you wood see on TV, like lizzie mcGuire for example.  but, these rich white gurls go to rich white schools that are hecka expensive, and are across the bay instead of in the city... that cheerleader is stupid!!  pathetically.

       today was kinda kool..last normal *school* day at aim high 4 the week.  tomorrow's our first cultural day!!!  (which is kinda weird, cuz we were supposed to have one last week) but whatever.  and its not like the 9th graders are bringing the food this week, so its all good    seminar was kool today!  we did these poems, and mine is SOOO cute! ::  japanese delight  sushi is my favorite food, it always gives a cheerful mood. sushi makes me say *hurray!* i wish i had it every day  i love the seaweed and rice inside, it makes my heart fill with pride the smooth handroll wanders down my throat, just like Popeye's sailboat  in my chopsticks that i hold, is a roll that will unfold. i'll only take just one more bite, it's my favorite japanese delight!   lol!!  it was supposed to be about our childhood, but apparently i didnt hear the teacher and i thought it was just a poem in  general .  lol..o well.   so there's this math teacher i *utterly loathe* and he's SOOO annoying.  i mean, there's nothing worse than::  a math teacher that not only cant explain what he's doing, but has bad breath, a voice that pisses you off, and makes you feel like you need to use a stressball!  GRRRrr.... and wen we were done doing work, he gave us more.  MORE!!!  and he seemed like he was trying to *know all math* but he didnt really know anything..no, that was just because he didnt know how to explain it.  which is a separate skill from math itself..   we went to the beach today!!!! (for city expo) and it was so awkward cuz i wuz wearin the wrong shoes and i didnt get my feet wet (and i didnt wanna!) so i was walking kinda funny in the sand... well, you wood too if you were wearing someone else's shoes!  and trying not to get them dirty.. .. newayz...A BIRD POOPED ON ME TOO!!!!!!!!!!  and it was SOOOO grrosss.... EEWWW!  you can read about it in miya's xanga too.  urlLink      im so bored, and im still bored.  aim high is a bad prrogram this year, and i doubt if it's gonna get better.  but the science is kool, cuz the teachers are really mellow and nice =) KOOLIO!!!!!!!  we went on a nature walk and we spotted that house thats on *that's so raven* =D everyone was all excited and stuff. LOL!!

      IM BACK FROM NYC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  yea, i hated it.  theres nothing worse than 100 ppl on each street corner impaitiently waiting for the sign to say *walk* or have the white light man on.  but even though 50% of them are waiting, (the tourists) the other 50% is breakin the law and just doing whatever!!!!!  such a weird city...and thats why the traffic is always so bad!!!!!!  poor bernie and her family...there in NYC rite now, probably suffering from the 92? weather.  hope their hotel got their power back for the AC!!!!!!!  lol!!!!  just read morgie's blog, and she was there almost the same time as me and we stayed in the same area! (times sq).  wow!  and we saw everything a day apart from each other..NBC tour, ground zero, and that hershey's chocolate place!!!! what a small world in such a big town...  the most adventurest part of new york wood have to be...on orchard street, when these chinese ppl were selling fake counterfeit purses on the street!!!!!  they heard the cops were coming by, so they would call each other up.  then, they'd shove all their purses and counterfeit items into those black garbage bags, run down the street, and  start selling again!!!!!  the scariest part wuz wen the store owners from the store that   I   was in heard an undercover cop was coming, so they shut down their metal door (click-click-click..) and just pretty much left us in the store with no explanation whatsoever...LOL!!!  then the other customer was calling her bf outside and sed *honey, they've locked us inside!!  no, i dunt know why...* haha!  my mom was so glad that we left the day before the big blackout!  so am i, cuz there is NOTHING for the tourists to do, cept walk.  half of them cant go to their hotel room, so they haveta sit in the streets!!!!!  and its not like the water's cheap currently either ($6!!)  i would hate that SOOO much and complain and whine, and my sister triple.    the metropolitan (i HATE that word!!!!  i always think its *metrop-something* so i have to repeat the darn word!) museum had a really kool exhibit on musical instruments!!!  silver bass flute, tiny violins, huge violas (that you play like a cello..well, it has that pin-thingy!), and a guitar-violin thing with 10 peg thingys at the top!!!!! interesting.  but we couldnt take pictures for some weirdo reason!!!!  well, my mom did anways...haha!! *hm...should i not take the picture, or take it-then have them yell at me?* :D  lincoln center!!!!! :D my family saw this dressed up italian guy carrying a violin case (or viola? im not so sure).  on 66th street, we followed him out the subway door--and he went to the auditorium thingy for the orchestra!!!!  i wood've asked for his autograph or something, but it would be kinda weird to walk up to a stranger and just say *hey, can i have ur autograph?* and since your so high up in that position, you can just call *security!!!* and have those weirdos out in a jiffy. haha..  ooo!!!  the center stage movie was shot there, and it was kool cuz i recognized everything (well, when i came home and spotted it out in the movie! lol)  i saw this ballerina holding a mango come out of julliard, and i think i sed *ballerina* when i was talking, and she starts looking at me weird.  hmmm...  saw rent, and now i have that *seasons of love* song stuck in my noggin!!!!  five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes!  how do you measure life..... AHHHH!!!!!  but it was a kool show.  they had three different relationships--lesbians, gay, and interracial.  so i guess it that was kool.  seasons of love....

      world lit was so funny today!!!  lol, it started with emily imitating mr. roberts (*okay..* haha) and she was soo shocked for some reason cuz he didnt say *okay*!!!!  haha.  and while taking notes from the overhead projector thingy, she dropped her pencil on the other side of her desk (you know those desks..kinda like the ones at hoover where you can only enter on one side, and its a HASSLE if u drop something on the other side) so she bends over.. and her desk flips over!!!!!!!!!!  lol!!!!!!!  =D then everyone looks at her funny, and emily just waves at the last person in the row and says *hi!!!!!* LOL.  soooo funny...and her stuff fell on the floor too!!!!  hahahahahaha..7* memories =)  GDT tryouts was kool =) it wasnt super hard, but i think that was cuz it was the first day.  we learned the basic moves (which was probably why it was so easy).  i saw olivia!!!!! (the one hu was 2nd violin and hit on graham...or so i heard) shes SOO different.  she dyed her hair dark magenta, and it goes down to her waist.  oh yea, shes really tall too (but im not sure if she was always like that or not).  lol.  i hope i make it!!! =D

THIS IS SO HARD.  so do me a favor:: PLEASE DUNT ASK ME HOW LINCOLN IS.  all i noe is..japanese is a LOT harder than it looks and in RO you can get docked off points for laffing.  little known fact::  the most commonly asked question at lincoln *do you have any gum?* lol, that was in princess diaries but its the same in every school.

      wutup comrades??? =D  today was pajama day!!!  wore my paul frank PJ bottems which were super baggy, and so long that they were trialing on the floor, so i had to hold them up.  i felt like a boy.  lol, and i put my hair up in two buns, then took it out a couple times to re-do it, and it got all curly!!!!!!  not that it was a surprise.  awww...out of 28 people in my HR, only 17 people participated!!!!!!  lol, only the girls in my new RO company did PJ day/crazy hair day.  searg let us out early for it though =)   and no one really likes the '07 cheer!  so everyone says it in their own speed, so everyone ends at a different time.   *class of 07, thats who we are!   the fantabulous freshman will go far.   what we love is red and gold,  how we feel is strong and bold.   fantabulous freshman,  GO MUSTANGS, GO!!!!!!!*  fantabulous freshman...are you confused by that unusual wording??  i didnt make it up, and no1 likes it.  *fly freshman* was too slang for mr. pang (hey, that rhymes!) and furious was too *full of anger* and NO one wanted first-class freshman...then agen, who would?  (sorry to offend people who DID want that.) oh, and fabulous was used two years ago, and fantastic was too disney-ish for us.  fabulous + fantastic = FANTABULOUS FRESHMAN!!  lol. that poster took a LONG time to paint.  and i dont paint wel either..only the other people do.    happy birthday julie!!!!!!!  happy tanjoubi--juu go sai desu (happy birthday..shes fifteen)  koolio!  i got 4 brain stamps today in manuel.  how cool is that??? (cept for the fact that their brains..) very =).  joe neilly's group is soooooo smart!!!!!  they got 6 brains..  lol, eric had a little ponytail on his head for crazee hair day, and he looked like a unicorn!!!! hahahaha...and ryan kept on putting rubber bands and hair things in his hair, but they kept falling out.  then he went to the bathroom, came back, and it looked like it was super windy outside, and he gelled it like that.  lol!!  he got a stamp for that.  sacrifice, due or die! alpha's the best,  better than the rest alpha company,  who rocks??   who rocks  (who rocks??)  who rocks  alpha company!!  it sounds better when you sound it off rather than reading it, though.  the orange game:  should be played with girls AND boys, because it looks weird when the girls hug each other to get it from each other's neck.  and their heads are like going at each other too....eewwww...we lost anyway, and seniors won.  figures.  *jocelyn??  she's just jocelyn!!!*

      what to do when...theres this cell project your doing for biology, and two ppl ask you to be your partner - a good frend and your crush.  first you pick ur closer frend, then the next day you switch to having your crush as a partner.  then, your close frend gets all mad at you and says *IM NOT TALKING TO YOU ANYMORE!!!!!!!!*  and your transferring too, so you cant say "can i work with you next time?" and you cant work in groups of 3.  and to make the matter worse, your frend has already thought about the project a LOT and has done a lot of the work.   what do you do?

      i dont understand.  this should be so easy..to just reach out my hand.  i know the world is real but nothings as it seems.  why i cant tell you freely, touchings not the only way to feel.  when the rain falls, its like heaven's crying and the name's all, the difference that there is cause tears are the same when they are trying to grow something good out of all the pain, theres no difference between the teardrops and the rain.

      woke up at 8:17 today!!!  for that MLK parade.  or, march.  so my mom and I were driving to lnc and all the doors were locked :\ WHY???  oh and there was this other guy standing around with his mom waiting too...he used to be in my jap class then he transferred!  anyways.. so i called melissa [woot i membered her digits!  well..its only one off from mine..] and she didnt go to the parade either!  she was at home :( her grandma's in the hospital and doesnt feel good...GET WELL MELISSA'S GRANNY!!!!!! :(  oh n she told me it was at the veterans parade one!!!!!!  oy.  which is...**out in the ghetto** as angela sed it gia yu: HEY!!!!  I LIVE THERE!!!! :D  then i called roshan to ask him what he was doing..hes supposed to be at the march too!!!  *damn its 9:13 in the morning!  oh the march was cancelled cuz of protestors and stuff.  the ppl that signed up got merits though*  aww!!!  the only parade that i DO wanna go to and its cancelled.  oy...  i have a dream that everyone wont be so rude.  when ppl hold open doors for you when your coming through...when people say *please and thank you*...when your walking down the street and strangers smile at you...when you see a classmate in the hall and they wave to you...when people just smile for the heck of it and not because of a joke or laughing at someone...that'll be the day.  why cant everyone be nice?  why cant everyone be polite?    i wished i lived on uranus where the ground is a flourescent teal...and its winter there half of the time, and the whole world is shifted 180º... i bet they dont have issues like we do.

       you think i have a crush on you.  you think i like you back.  but my palms dont get all sweaty when i see the site of you.  in addition, you annoy me.  and you?  you wear that red ecko shirt 3 times a week.  you keep a tube of peanut butter in your backpack.  when everyone gets an A on that test, you get a B.  stop dissing my frends and stop making me laff...because im not worth it.  and watashi no anata wa daikilai desu   i wish i were anywhere but here...
