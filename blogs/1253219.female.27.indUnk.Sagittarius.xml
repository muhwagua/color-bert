						    Travelblogue   I was going to write about my trip to Missouri in detail, but I have decided just to post some observations. It's going to be boring either way, but this way it is shorter.   We took I-40 until we reached Oklahoma, where we took various turnpikes. I took my digital camera along and attempted to take photos. This was not easy, as my camera isn't very good at "action" shots because it takes a while to take the photo. I had to try to anticipate when I would be in the right place before I hit the shutter. My judgement of the delay of the camera wasn't always good, as the photo of the front end of a BNSF train (See below) demonstrates.    Welcome to "Fort Tourist Trap"     On the way to our first stop in Santa Rosa NM, I got to see a stretch of I-40 that I had seen many times while I was in college at UNM. It's boring as hell between Flagstaff and Albuquerque. There are all sorts of strange attractions along this road like dinosaurs and various "Indian" trading posts (see the photos below).  These shops usually feature a mishmash of Anglo stereotypes about Native Americans such as tepees with dancing Kachinas painted on them. Further down the road they even have billboards with "Running Indian" on it: a comic figure of a little Indian man in a headdress and tomahawk running in his moccasins. The irony is that real Native Americans live in these places, and one wonders what they think of the images of them presented by these roadside attractions. (In fact, some of them may be Native American-owned). Just down the road from the wooden tepees sits a traditional Navajo hogan  (see photo below) with its many sides and door facing east. If you look closely as you pass through this area you can see many hogans of all sizes and made from any kind of material from logs to cinder block.    Complimentary Scorpion    In Santa Rosa we ate at a place called the Lake City Diner (see photo) on 4th street. If you even go though Santa Rosa and can take a break, you have to visit it. The food is excellent. I had a green chile chicken enchilada because when you're in New Mexico you must have the green chiles. The diner is located in the First National Bank building constructed in 1901, and the waiter station is located in the old vault. After dinner we saw another one of Santa Rosa's attractions, The Blue Hole (see photo). This is a spring that is 81 feet deep and very clear. People use it for scuba diving and swimming.   Our stay in Santa Rosa would have been better if we had not found a scorpion in our room after we returned from seeing the Blue Hole! There was a large crack under our door, and I think it may have crawled in that way. (I don't have a photo of it because we were trying to kill it.) No one slept well that night, and when we told the lady in the office the next morning her response was: "Oh yeah. They come out after we spray and we just sprayed."  We told her about the gap under the door and she said "Oh yeah, I'll tell the maintenance guy." I got the impression that she wouldn't.    Texas   I noticed an abandoned railway alignment that follows Route 66. All that remains is a berm with ties (sleepers?) set on top of it. I have a photo posted of the pilings of a small bridge (see below). I could see this alignment from eastern NM, across Texas and into OK. I think I saw an old station some miles outside of Amarillo, Texas. In this area the track bed was nothing more that a slight linear disturbance in the ground that can be seen from I-40. I am in the process of trying to figure out what it is, but I think it might be an abandoned route of the Chicago, Rock Island, and Gulf railway, but I am waiting on confirmation of this. If so, the rails along this route were taken up in 1984.   We also passed the  urlLink "Big Texan"  where they have this HUGE steak, like 72 oz. If you can eat it in an hour it's free. (I believe this was parodied on an episode of the Simpson‚Äôs). Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt able to get a photo of the restaurant. You can‚Äôt miss it. It‚Äôs a huge yellow complex of buildings.   Another roadside attraction is the Leaning Water tower outside of Groom, Texas (see photo). According to this  urlLink website     The tower, which says ‚ÄúBRITTEN USA‚Äù is actually part of a Route 66 truck stop. The Britten truck stop put up the leaning tower to attract business, and it still attracts many photos. (Just Google ‚ÄúBRITTEN USA‚Äù and see what you get!)  The Britten tower is very near the ‚ÄúLargest Cross in the Western Hemisphere‚Äù (see photo). In fact, there is a curve in the westbound lane of I-40 where they can be seen on the horizon together. (No photo, unfortunately)    We stopped at what must be the last gas station with a full-service pump in the US. It was a 1970‚Äôs (?) era Chevron station near Amarillo.  I had not heard the sound of a gas station bell since I was a small child living in Missouri.  I took a photo of a tile I found in the ladies room. It was a typical dirty gas station restroom (but not the worst I have ever seen). Always on the lookout for irony, I snapped this photo (see below) of a tile describing that the bathroom is checked regularly (once a year?) etc....      I also saw a sight that can only be seen in Texas: A large propane tank with a Texas flag flying from it.  (D*mn, no picture!)    We soon said goodbye to Texas and hello to Oklahoma. We passed through Yukon, OK, apparently the home of Garth Brooks. I have a photo of the water tower bearing this information below.  My great-aunt lives in OK City, but we didn't have time to visit her. In Oklahoma the countryside finally started to look more mid-western as we got on one of the many turnpikes.  The motel in Joplin, MO was scorpion-free. The only odd things we saw in OK was a man with a telephoto lens taking pictures of an overpass on one of the turnpikes.    Bombs Bursting in Air  The next day we made it to my grandparents‚Äô house in Missouri, near the Lake of the Ozarks. The road to their house is a winding two-lane highway lined with small mom and pop shops, antique stores, boat lift shops, small car dealerships, lumber yards, barber shops, garages, and little restaurants that have Friday fish-fries. It was such a relief to see a landscape that was not scraped off and paved over with identical strip malls and soulless housing developments like I saw in AZ, NM, TX and even OK. Not a chain store or restaurant could be found, expect the occasional Pizza Hut. Anyone on the hunt for a Frappucchino would be sorely disappointed. Dotted among these shops were numerous yellow and orange striped tents filled with fireworks.  I have never purchased or had a chance to set any off before (since they are illegal here), so we bought some sparklers and snakes (see photo below). I was astounded at some of the fireworks that were sold at these stands. They ranged from innocent bottle-rockets and firecrackers to huge shells with big cardboard tubes from which to launch them.  The big fireworks had names like "The Heart Stopper,"  "Mystical Dragon," and "Do You Hear What I'm Sayin'?" This is the same nation where we have to put ‚ÄúCaution: Contents Hot‚Äù on coffee cups to avoid lawsuits, so I find it amazing that we let people play with explosives without training or a license of any kind. I noticed that the fireworks are made in China from a company in Hong Kong, so I doubt they have any liability and you would never be able to sue them if you wanted to.  Antique Stores  There are many antique stores in this part of Missouri as well. I like to go to antique stores in Missouri because they tend to have actual antiques. In Arizona antique stores tend to carry junk from the 1970's. I purchased what might be a 1900-1918 Ernst Wahliss art pottery (porcelain) vase. It's not very big or fancy, but I only paid $12 for it (see photo above).  The woman who owned the little store said that people demand a very cheap price for her wares and then turn around and sell them on ebay.  Soon it was time to go home, and all I can say about the return trip was that it was all of the above in reverse, minus the scorpion. (Not really, but I think this blog is long enough already) We did see the Jacket Fire that is burning near Flagstaff. It wasn‚Äôt much of anything at the time, but now it threatens to burn a major powerline that feeds Phoenix.

						    urlLink    I followed this old railroad alignment from NM through Texas and into Oklahoma. It roughly follows the Route 66 alignment. In many places it is a berm with the wooden ties (sleepers?) still in place on top. In some areas the berms have been cleared and the ties are stacked in piles at the edges of the fields. I will look into this line, but I guess it was an early transcontinental line...? After all, the route followed by Rt 66 was originally scouted out as a railroad route. This is the remains of an old bridge.  &nbsp; urlLink

						   Oscar Night     I was watching bits of the Oscars tonight and I was sickened by Michael Mooreís fictitious acceptance speech. I have nothing against people speaking out, but the Oscars is not the appropriate forum.  Mooreís comments about the fictitious President that was fictitiously elected and a fictitious war (or whatever) were all inflammatory, and I could see how you might agree with him, but his comments about the ìfictitious orange alerts,î were way out of line.      Mr. Moore, are you suggesting that the terrorist threat is fictitious?  Were the events of September 11th, 2001 fictitious? Were the images of  passenger jets being flown into buildings full of people, and the subsequent catastrophic collapse of those structures only figments of our collective imaginations?  Was the phone call placed by Todd Beamer, as he and other passengers tried to take back Flight 93 from their hijackers fictitious?  Is the enormous void in Lower Manhattan fictitious? Were the over 3,000 lives that were lost fictitious?

						   My war Blog: (Part 1)   AKA: Some opinions of the uninformed:   To be honest I donít know what I think about this war. I guess that is why I am not too upset about the demonstrators on either side of this thing.   At the outset I was convinced that president Bush had some kind of intelligence that suggested that Saddam Hussein was a threat. There had to be a reason for him to be pounding the war drum beyond the well-known  personal grudge. I supported the war at that point.   As the months went on, there was no evidence of anything that might make Saddam an immediate threat. I still hoped we had secret and damning intelligence that we could not share for some reason. Bush went to the UN, which I thought was a good idea. No weapons were found, but the Iraqis did a great job of stalling, giving the UN bullshit documents, and hiding  things from the inspectors. They didnít allow U2 spy planes to be used (Which should not be a problem if he has nothing to hide.) Saddam is a ruthless, evil man with a history of lying and noncompliance.    However, if we were watching him, wasnít that a form of containment?  What could he do while we were watching him and inspectors were crawling all over Iraq? Why couldnít we wait? On the other hand, he had 12 years to comply, and I doubt he had any intention of doing so.   President Bush castigates the UN for being impotent. This is nothing new; for as long as I can remember the UN has done a lot of talking and has rarely taken action. They put peacekeepers in a war-torn country but refuse to let them fire their weapons to keep the peace, they talk about punishing rogue states but refuse to put armies together to do it. Bush was right to compare them to the League of Nations.   However, our government pushed and pushed, like a spoiled child to get their wishes passed, and when France,  Germany, and Russia refused, we threw a temper tantrum.  Of course Russia and France were selling arms to the Iraqis, a violation of their own precious UN treaty. (The French owe us one, by the way.) The US, Britain, and Australia go ahead with war anyway. A Coalition of three.   Tony Blair. This guy has guts. I have to respect him for going against his party and his people to support us. He was immensely supportive after September 11th and continues to be despite the political pressure against him. I have to wonder what Bush said to him, or what intelligence he shared with Blair to convince him. Tony Blair has been compared to Bill Clinton, but Clinton would never have had the courage to do something unpopular, even if he felt it was right.  To be continuedÖ.

						   Dave still has shingles, and one of his good friends (George Miller) passed away recently. I guess this is not a good time for anyone.      We need Dave more than ever right now, I mean I need my "Will it Float?" fix. We need to be grounded and centered by Words of Wisdom from Dr.Phil. We need Dave's "desk rants," we need humor.  It's the antidote for incessant and useless war coverage in the (current) absence of an actual war. Anyone who saw his post 9/11 show (Sep 17th 2001) knows that Dave knows how to present the right mixture of gravity and humor.

						   My War Blog Part 2  AKA: Some Opinions of the Marginally Informed   I have been busy lately, so I havenít added to this thing as often as I would like to. I had the intention of writing some long-winded essay on how I feel about this war. I think thatís unnecessary since I seem to change my mind daily.    Bottom line: If Iraq is truly dangerous to our national security (for reasons that are still secret or I assume they would have shared them with us), then I support this war. If this is an excuse by President Bush to go after Saddam for personal reasons, then I will not be voting for him in the next presidential election. (Hell, I may not vote for him anyway.) Iím not sure any of us, as in regular civvies will really know what is going on until itís all over.   I find it interesting that Bush was itching to attack Iraq right after 9/11 BEFORE going after Al Qaeda. Thank goodness Tony Blair talked him out of it.  I donít understand the logic of going after a potentially dangerous state while ignoring the one that actually carried out the attack. My friends were all opposed to the war in Afghanistan, but I wasnít. It was necessary and justified, and I hope the Second Gulf War is as well.   The Media and the War  I read a page on the Beebís website (http://www.BBC.com/ ) about public opinion on media coverage of the War.  People from all over the world could post their opinions. I find it interesting that two people could watch the same coverage and one could declare it pinko-liberal and pro-Iraqi, and another sees it as a jingoistic propaganda tool of the US Government. I guess it all depends on which side of center you happen to lean.   Since I donít quite know which way I lean (despite the party affiliation on my voter registration card), I see most of the major networks as being anti-war before the war broke out, and still so, but in a subtle way. The reporters make snide remarks every so often about the progress of the war or the performance of the troops, yet there are few reports about civilian losses (Except from Arab TV, which is a propaganda mill as well). I get the feeling that weíre getting a sanitized version of events, but the reporters arenít really happy about it.  The BBC World Service, once the bastion of balanced reporting, is broadcasting nonstop negative reports about what the US is doing in Iraq. They seem to forget that there are British soldiers involved as well (It must have slipped their mind). Their website seems to be much better, with a mixture of good and bad news. I just try to remember that itís all propaganda in some form or another.    Opinion  I want to hear news, not opinion. Peter Arnet is in trouble for giving his opinion. He can have an opinion, but itís not his job to report it. Get an editorial column if you feel like voicing you opinions, otherwise just stick to the facts (Or a close approximation).   This just in: Now weíre making noises about going after Syria. I hope this is not true.    Random thought: Whatís wrong with a little jingoism now and then?

						   Three words: Gorgeous Colin Firth.   Now, to be honest, I havenít seen What A Girl Wants for obvious reasons. Iíll rent it when it comes out on video.  I have been told that Firth is in nearly every scene, so it might make up for the fact that it is intended for preteens. I have, however, rented everything I can find at the local Blockbuster, which isnít much. I have purchased the DVD set of Pride and Prejudice (the famous damp shirt!) and plan on buying Bridget Jonesí Diary and a cute little film called My Life So Far. Iíll probably have to get the latter from Amazon.    I wish we had a real video store here. The kind of store I'm looking for specializes in less well-known films. They have *all* of Orson Wellesí and Alfred Hitchcockís films, good and bad.  They have all of those foreign films too. Want to watch a weird and utterly confusing film by Jean Cocteau? No problem. Itís the kind of store where you can rent The Singing Detective, and they have an entire section devoted to Cary Grant, etc. These places exist. I have seen them. Unfortunately they arenít anywhere close to where I live.

						   A Usenet Community    I have been lurking and posting to Usenet since 1996 when I was liberated from AOL. Lately, I have been thinking about the sociology of online communities. I actually had a Soc. professor who had done her dissertation on Usenet. My favourite newsgroup has always been alt.fan.letterman (AFL). I first posted a message there sometime in 1996. Over the years there have been personalities who have drifted in and out of the newsgroup (NG). One pillar of AFL is Don Giller (AKA Donz, Donz5), who is the foundation of the NG. I started reading Donzís Letterman Folder posts when I was on AOL in 1993.  He has taped and compiled a database of every Late Night and Late Show that was ever broadcast. Ask Donz any LN/LS-related question and he can answer it. For example, one could ask who was on the show on Feb 13, 1983, and if there was a show on that night, he could tell you who the guests were and even what bits were done. His archive has been so valuable that the producers of a Headliners and Legends special on David Letterman tapped Donzís personal goldmine for material. Two other AFLíers (Traci and Carl) also contributed to the special.   AFL is a tight-knit little online community of posters and goodness knows how many lurkers. Even staffers from the Late Show have been known to lurk and post. However, Dave does not read AFL as far as we know, and posts addressed to him will be answered with a sarcastic ìDave ainít here, man.î Each night the show is summarised and dissected. Guests are torn to shreds for being boring, flighty, or stupid, comedy bits are judged for lameness, every piece of music played by the CBSO is carefully logged, and the show as a whole is summed up in a concise Late Show Quick Guide. Two AFL regulars make screen captures of key points in the show and post them on their web sites. There is even a place for fanfic-if you dare. Even the trolls are relatively interesting in AFL. One in particular likes to post ellipsis-filled inane messages usually ending in ìÖ.HOLY CRAP!î Then there is a troll who will teach you the finer points of Gentonism. (No I donít what Gentonism is either).  The AFL community extends beyond the Internet. Each summer, selected AFLers converge on 53rd and Broadway to attend ìDaveCon,î the annual pilgrimage of the Dave faithful. They attend a taping or two, and are often allowed to go onstage and even backstage after the show. Each time an AFLer attends a show, they are obligated to prepare an online ìTrip Reportî with photos describing their experience. And AFL has even changed lives. AFLíers Sharon Best and Alan Page met through AFL, and are now engaged to be married. They met at a Late Show taping in October (The Warren Zevon Show).   The AFL family keeps the NG alive and bristling with humour, dripping with sarcasm and riddled with AFL-specific acronyms that drive newbies insane. For example: NTTAWTT, SLDSH, AITWAKHPTCB,  etc. If you are interested in posting to this NG, mind you lurk before you leap. There are many in-jokes and running gags that create a minefield for the uninitiated. Such subjects as pie, honeymoons, and dental floss have special significance and should not be taken lightly. A good command of English grammar and spelling are a must. AFL is a great companion to the Late Show, and my viewing experience isnít complete until I have read it.   Oh, and whatever you do, donít ever mention Harry Truman. Youíll thank me later.    AFLer Sofia Norberg once posted this about the dynamic in AFL: "To make posting here at Ass-Bitch Central more enjoyable for everyone, every post is now scrutinized by grammar goons and spelling nazis, torn apart by smart-asses and cranky bastards, then graded 'funny' or 'not' by a guy who thinks I'm a newbie, after which more hilarity ensues as the Inner Sanctum argue among themselves about whether his choices are right or wrong, and then - finally - we all view the scoreboard so we can tell who's funnier."   ILIHAT!

						   May We See Your Fake Photos Please?    A couple of kids went to NYC to see the Late Show. They were too young to get in, but they hung around 53rd and Broadway and managed to meet several folks who work on the show, including DAVE. They posted their trip report on their web page with the pictures to prove that they had met Dave &ndash; or so we thought. Eagle-eyed troll Carol, was ready to debunk the story. She presented several weak (pathetic) arguments based on what she considers to be &ldquo;logic&rdquo; to prove that the photos were faked.&nbsp;   Now in general, AFLer&rsquo;s are a savvy bunch who are not about to be taken for a ride. They were quick to find the real version of the doctored photos. Check them out. Links to the "fake" and the "originals" are listed above.

						    I have just seen the trailer for Love Actually It's here:  [ urlLink Trailers ] I am hoping this will be a good one. early reviews are good, but who knows. Apparently it's still in editing. The trailer features a snippet or two of of ODB (Colin Firth).&nbsp; They may leave in the bit about Sep 11th. I wonder if they should, I mean it didn't affect them (The British) like it did us. They can use a reference to it in a RomCom in the UK without trivialising it, but how will it go over across the pond? I will post the narration that mentions 9/11 when I find it.

						   Netscape R.I.P.    I read on Auntie Beeb (The BBC online) the other day that Netscape is being discontinued. I was a bit sad to hear this, as I have been using Netscape since 1995. This article contained some links to other sites, including mozilla.org, and a site that offers browser emulators for a walk down memory lane. The site lets you chose a dinosaur browser and one of their links or put in your own and see how the old browsers performed. I chose Netscape Navigator c. 1994. I went to some familiar pages and saw how there were no background images, no frames, no tables, no Java. Just a long page of text and pictures that one would have to scroll through. Ah, the good old days.     I sometimes forget that it has almost been a decade since I first surfed the Web. I joined AOL in 1993, and knew about the Web, but as I said we didn&rsquo;t have access to it at first. I remember waiting impatiently for the new service. I can&rsquo;t imagine living without it. I didn&rsquo;t get to experience the Web until 1994 (?), when AOL made it available to it&rsquo;s users with a terrible clunky piece-of-crap browser that was primitive even for that time. I left AOL in 1995 for a real ISP, and was able to use Netscape (Netscape was much faster and more stable.) and having been using some version of it ever since.     Upon hearing the news that Netscape was doomed, I downloaded the latest version of Mozilla. I will give it a test drive tonight to see how it shapes up. It is similar in appearance and layout to Netscape for obvious reasons, but I don&rsquo;t yet know how it handles. It does seem to have some additional and useful features.      The BBS     This has made me nostalgic! I remember when we got our first PC, a 286 15 MHz IBM clone, built for us by a guy we knew who ran a small local computer company.&nbsp; It was quite a mysterious thing, especially to someone like me who had only used Apples and the odd TRS 80 (A dinosaur even at that time!). It had a color VGA screen, and a mouse. It had a 40 MB internal hard drive (The guy claimed it was all we would ever need). Most importantly it had a modem. The guy who built the computer left a list of phone numbers to call. These were Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) around town. It took me a while to get up the courage to dial one up on our screaming 2600 baud modem, but I finally did. Before long I was listed on several local BBS&rsquo; and became acquainted with some of the sysops, none of whom I ever met face to face.&nbsp; There was one in particular, a guy who&rsquo;s handle was &ldquo;Nifty Corpse,&rdquo; who seemed to be quite famous in the local BBS community. One time a sysop broke in and we chatted. He said it was rare that girls would join a BBS, and of course he tried to pick me up (he would not have bothered if he could have seen me). The sysop tried to impress me with his computer. It was a kick ass something that he had built himself with all the newest, fastest guts and software. It was impressive, but then he ruined the moment by mentioning that he drove a VW Rabbit. I suppose one must have priorities. &nbsp;    &nbsp;I soon became interested in ANSI graphics (remember that!?) and downloaded a little program called &ldquo;The Draw&rdquo; that allowed one to produce these lovely images. The best part about the whole BBS thing was ITCNet and FidoNet. I used to read the ITCNet teen chat. It was exciting to read messages posted by people all over the US! (Remember this was before I had AOL). It was my first taste of something like Usenet. I also found the &ldquo;Berlin Connection&rdquo; a BBS that specialised in connecting Americans with family and friends serving in Germany.     My friend Sara introduced me to AOL when we were in High School, and I never went back to the BBS. I wonder if any of them are still around? They were really the equivalent of a home page now. Each one was designed by the author&nbsp; (sysop) just as they wanted it, with their own ANSI art and with discussion boards devoted to their interests. To me, AOL was a much flashier and bigger version of a BBS, and I found it very impressive at the time. Later I found AOL cumbersome and irritating.       Why I left AOHell    To be honest I left AOL for a bunch of reasons, mostly that AOL simply didn&rsquo;t work (This was early 1995 and they were growing so fast that their infrastructure could not keep up. I assume it has improved or they would have gone out of business). I also became annoyed with their online tech support. Tech support was set up as a chat room, and you would go in and wait in a virtual queue for the tech to get to your question. This was a typical (albeit fictional) exchange:    LameTech103: Blah blah&hellip;What is your question?     TudorRose: I was downloading a file and&hellip;    (The text boxes in tech chats were unusual in that they only held a short line of text and it didn&rsquo;t wrap, so you had to submit another line if it was too long. This allowed the tech time to cut in, and they always did.)     LameTech103: I am sending you Downloading 101. Check your mail for it. It should help. Good bye.     Then the tech would go on to the next person. &ldquo;Downloading 101&rdquo; was a useless document written for complete idiots, and it did not answer my question.&nbsp; I noticed that if one had a feminine &ldquo;nick&rdquo; the techs would always write you off as stupid and send you a dreaded&nbsp; &ldquo;101&rdquo; document. However, users with a neutral or masculine nick were allowed to finish their entire questions and then the techs actually made some kind of attempt to answer them. (Or maybe it was all just my imagination.) I decided that AOL wasn&rsquo;t worth the effort and I left. I was a little scared to venture out of the safe, shiny AOL bubble, but it was worth the leap. I did miss some things like the Letterman and X-files folders. These were similar to Usenet groups, but for AOLers only.&nbsp; I also had to give up my kewl nick &ldquo;DScullyFBI&rdquo;. &nbsp;  (I&rsquo;m not a nerd or anything)  &nbsp;

						   What have I learned today? A "private" blog isn't really private.  I think this is why they manufacture those books with the blank pages called diaries. Yes, I have a link to here on my web page, but who the hell ever goes to my web page? (I have a hit counter so I know the answer to that question.) I guess itís a good thing I haven't posted my 300 page manifesto on why poodles should be running the country.  Boy, that would have been embarrassing!  I guess Iíll leave up my AFL blog. Someone posted it, so itís out anyway. I took down the rambling pointless blog on fanatics and the internet. I wouldnít have had the time to compose (If that is the right word) any blogs if I had a job.

						   I have noticed that President Bushís case for war in Iraq closely paralleled the efforts of Winston Churchill to alert the world to the threat posed by Hitler. It makes one wonder if President Bush and PM Tony Blair have read ìThe Gathering Stormî and used it as a guide. President Bush did make reference to appeasing dictators and the League of Nations.  The obvious difference is that Hitler was a very grave threat, but the full scale Saddamís threat to our country, if any, has yet to be proven. Last night I was reading a chapter in ìTheir Finest Hourî and it contained my favourite Churchill quote:   ëHistory with its flickering lamp stumbles along the trail of the past trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days.í  Churchill said those words about his late predecessor Neville Chamberlain. I expect I am missing his true meaning, but Churchill goes on to question the use of history with its flawed and incomplete view of the past. He argues that a man is really measured by his conscience. Churchill knew Chamberlain would be judged harshly, so he chose to highlight his intentions, not his foibles. Chamberlain wanted to avoid another bloody, pointless war, and he only failed in his attempt because he was signing a worthless pact with an evil and duplicitous man. Churchill argued that when hearts are weighed, the flawed picture presented by history loses its importance.   Why am I going on about this? I think this principle may apply to Prime Minister Tony Blair and President George W. Bush today. With what intention and with what conscience did these men make the heavy decision to go to war? Was it for the good of Iraq and for our two nations, or was it for some other, less noble purpose? Were the data on WMD embellished, and if so, why? If the real reason for war was not WMD, then why not reveal the truth to us? Surely if it was compelling enough for President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, it would be so for the rest of the world.

						   I have just discovered Coldplay. Yeah, I know I'm really behind. I have been hearing about them for ages and meanwhile I have had my head stuck in the sand for the last three years (Graduate school).    I heard this fabulous song one day in Macy's and was mesmerized by it. I wanted to know who it was and for months I heard it here and there, but never on the radio or in any context where the name of the band might be revealed.  I happened to remember some of the lyrics, so I did a Google search on what little bits I could remember. After several dead-ends I happened upon a personal page that had some of the lyrics and "(Coldplay)." So I went to a Coldplay lyrics site and looked at each song until I found what I had remembered. It was "Clocks." Just to make sure, I found a site that had a streaming video for Clocks. That was it! I bought the album today and I am listening to it for the first time as I type this. I know I could have illegally downloaded it from somewhere, but why? I wanted to hear the whole album and it is better just to buy it. I would however like it if the record companies woke up and offered music by the song for a small fee (Like Apple's site). I would pay for it, as I always rip all of my CD's in order to play them on Winamp on my PC and my portable MP3 player. I love the freedom of making up a playlist and being able to arrange it and rearrange it according to my mood.      I am enjoying it v. v. Much so far. I'm always happy to find new music because I hate 90% of the crap they play on the radio. K-lite is now playing all the songs that were really big when I was in High School.  This is a sure sign of aging .&nbsp; Smashing Pumpkins on K-lite?  It's just wrong.

						   I haven&rsquo;t blogged in some time because I haven&rsquo;t really felt like it. All I could do is complain about how disappointed I am in the Bush Administration. I am most disappointed at the way we sent our soldiers into a very dangerous place for reasons that have not been clearly defined.     I&rsquo;m also pissed off that I spent 3 years getting a graduate degree but have been unable to find a job (I finished school 8 months ago!),&nbsp; Who cares really?     So what have I left to Blog about? Colin Firth. Again.  Why Colin? I have no life, but I have lots of unwanted free time to ruminate on such important topics as Colin&rsquo;s lack of eyebrows, how generally gorgeous he is despite the aforementioned lack of eyebrows, and whether it was really necessary to revisit the fight scene in Bridget Jones 2.     Colin Firth Fandom    Here you have a guy who&rsquo;s been busting his ass (arse?) as a &ldquo;jobbing actor&rdquo; as he puts it, for years, but he never seems to get any notice. Every time he releases a new film, all of his fans all wait eagerly thinking, &ldquo;This is it! He&rsquo;ll make the big time now!&rdquo; Yet, it never seems to happen. (Firth seems perfectly happy with this however, as his acting jobs are very steady and that is all he admits to caring about.)&nbsp; Maybe his fans are the only ones who are disappointed.     For example, recently I saw two trailers for Love Actually. The first was British, and it had equal amounts of Grant and Firth, if not slightly more Firth. The American trailer, however, was all about Grant. I think Colin got a brief half a second. &nbsp;    Colin does seem to be more famous in the UK, where he made quite an impression in BBC&rsquo;s Pride and Prejudice (1995) where his Fitzwilliam Darcy sent women swooning with his &ldquo;wet shirt&rdquo; scene. But why can&rsquo;t he seem to get a foothold here in the US where A&amp;E shows Pride and Prejudice every year?     Things do seem to be changing, however. At the recent New York premiere of Love Actually Firths fans made quite a ruckus while fans of Hugh Grant were either absent or tongue-tied. Co-star Emma Thompson even commented on the enthusiastic reaction. Fans at the Today Show on Monday made a sign for him, and on The View today a fan had a sign that read &ldquo;COLIN.&rdquo; Colin came out to a &ldquo;standing O&rdquo; and lots of screaming, especially while they were showing clips of Bridget Jones.     At one of these events, the press actually asked his fans to scream &ldquo;COLIN!&rdquo; again as if he were still there, long after he had left the red carpet. I think the clip was used later and the impression was given that the piece was filmed while he was there!     Crossing the Line    There are several Colin Firth message boards (which I will refrain from identifying) where fans have been posting their personal accounts of premiers and screenings of Girl With a Pearl Earring, and Love Actually (New York and London.)&nbsp; One woman on one particular board (which I will also refrain from identifying) was at the recent New York premiere of Love Actually. Colin was signing autographs when he approached this woman to sign her book. The fan, who according to other sources had been warned by security already, grabbed poor Colin by the shoulder or lapel and kissed him on his dimpled cheek!     Assuming that all of the accounts of the event posted by fans on other message boards are true, Mr. Firth did not seem pleased (The fan in question did not mentioned this of course.)&nbsp; He was gracious and went on with his autographing duty, but you have to wonder what he was thinking.     I have this to say to her: That was way out of line, and actions like that might just make him decide not to greet his fans anymore! I know you feel like it was OK, but how would you feel if some random strange man grabbed you and kissed you?     Ok, now I have that off my chest!

						    The Employment Agency    After sorting though the marketing jobs and applying for 11 jobs that did not have marketing in their title, I decided to go to an employment agencyís website.   I decided to go ahead and fill out the online forms. It was all so convenient. All I had to do was post a resume, list my skills, and schedule an appointment at one of their locations right there online. Great. So I listed all of my experience, but mentioned that I didnít expect this agency to find me a job in my field. I clearly stated that although I had an MA in a specific field, I was only looking for a clerical position. Surely they have some filing and general office positions. Right?   Three days later, on a Friday evening I received a phone call from a woman who informed me in a sour voice that I was ìtoo unskilledî and they could not help me. I tried to explain to her that I didnít expect her to find me a job in my field, just a clerical position. She responded by saying: ìWe only deal with professionals.î

						   I have updated the old Blog. I still intend to actually write something. I was thinking about starting a new blog about my adventures trying to find a job. That's why I changed the name of this blog to "The Bitter Boat"    I have been looking for a job for a year now.  (Hey George, where the **** are all of those new jobs? ) To be honest, I donít blame President Bush for the job loss. It was just bad timing, but don't tell me that there are jobs when it just isn't true!  I have given up on archaeology for a while. There are other fish in the sea, so I'm going to go try to find them!  So from now on I think I might post about my wonderful job-hunting odyssey. So here it is, The Bitter Boat.*      *My friend Holly was the first and only person I know who uses this phrase. I have no idea where it originated. I'll have to Google it.

						    No more whining - for now   Looks like I have to stop whining. Have found a job at a real estate brokerage. I'm an "administrative assistant" which in my case is just a very low level secretary. I started on Tuesday, so I don't know how things are going yet. It's a new experience. Murphy's Law is in full effect as usual. Today I found two full-time perm Archaeology jobs posted. A whole  TWO  jobs at the same time in the same state! That's a record. I applied to one of them, but I'm not holding my breath.

						    Wonderfalls   I have found a new TV show that I think I might actually make a habit of watching. Itís called Wonderfalls and itís on Friday nights at 9 p.m. (8 p.m. here) on FOX. Itís quirky, weird, acerbic, and I can identify with the main character in many ways.  This show reminds me of how far TV has fallen with its endless string of lame ìrealityî TV shows where skinny blondes in bikinis and buff shirtless men eat disgusting things as they vote each other out of the boardroom while having extreme queer-eye makeovers. (BTW I do enjoy QE in small doses) I long for the days of shows like Seinfeld, Frasier (when it was good), and Cheers.  My other favorite shows at the moment are The Gilmore Girls, The West Wing, Coupling (PBS), and Alias (even though I think it may be close to jumping the shark if it hasnít already). Oh, and I cannot forget Letterman, whom I have watched religiously since 1992.

						   I am taking a break from whining about my unemployment for a moment to blog about something that I usually write about in my "analogue" diary.   The following is only my opinion  as an American who is watching this unfold on TV and reading it on the BBC online.    11-M   Today a terrorist group has influenced the elections in a free democratic nation.  The significance of this event cannot be underestimated. Last Thursday, March 11, 2004 terrorists murdered 201  people and injured 1,400 others.  For the Spanish, 11 March will always be a day of mourning just as 11 September is for us.  This attack came on the eve of important national elections.  The day before the attack the election was almost too close to call but after it was revealed that al-Qaeda, not Eta, might have been responsible for the attack, there was a change in public opinion.  It was as if the people of Spain saw the attacks as a result of the ruling party's support of the war in Iraq and they cast their votes accordingly.    A large majority of the Spanish people did not support the decision to help the United States in the war in Iraq, so one might argue that the attack drove more people to go out and vote.  Isn't this a textbook example of democracy in action?  It would seem to be at first glance, but upon closer inspection something more insidious is revealed.  To this American observer it looked as if the Spanish believed that they could bargain for their security by voting for a government that would pull Spanish troops out of Iraq.  This was not democracy in action; it was the manipulation of an election by fear and the slaughter of innocent people. If the election results were just a coincidence, a sort of collateral effect of the attack, then it was far more successful than the terrorists ever intended.  Several European nations seem to be returning to the idea that they will be safe as long as they try not to do anything that might give their enemies a reason to attack them. This did not work in the past (e.g. the appeasement policies of the 1930's) and it will not work now. The French are worried about an attack in retaliation for legislation to ban religious symbols such as headscarves in state schools. In this case it is not their involvement with the US that makes France a possible target, but their own internal policy.  What is to stop the terrorists from carrying out attacks wherever and whenever they please because they disagree with national policy?  Are the Europeans going to have to think twice every time they pass a law?   Today the terrorists have won. They have learned that they can use bombs not only to kill but also to influence the outcome of a democratic election.  If we allow this to continue we are giving up our freedom and opening the door to a threat that is every bit as perilous as that posed by communism, fascism, or any other oppressive ideology that is spread and maintained by terror, coercion, and mass murder.

						    Just when you think you have it figured out...   I got a call today from woman at bead store. I didn't want to hear from her because I really didn't feel like being told I didn't get the job. I waited for her to tell me I was a loser, and almost fell over when she said, "We would like to hire you." (I sh*t you not.) There was a long silence. This was because I was trying to understand what I had just heard.    She said "You remember..?' I said: "I got the impression that I was completely the wrong person for the job!"  I don't remember the rest of the conversation, but I thanked her and turned it down. Why? Because I didn't think I wanted to work for someone who had been so rude at the interview. I had left feeling humiliated and embarrassed. How bad would it be if I actually worked for him?  Why knowingly go into a job when you have already had problems with the boss?   I don't know if I have made a mistake, and now I have no right to whine about being unemployed!       Today's Lesson: You never can tell about interviews! I had a stellar one last October and never heard from the company again (not even a "sorry, you're a loser" letter), and now this terrible one that resulted in a job offer. Go figure.

						    Or, maybe not...   Bead interview was v. bad. Came in and a woman threw an application at me. (Found out later is was actually OK, as she was just busy. She was v. nice.) Answered a few questions and then she showed me around the store.  Was v. impressed. Then she went in the back to speak to the owner.   I went in to talk to him and he began by asking me about my degree. Anthropology, what is it? I explained briefly that it was the study of man. Then he then started grilling me about the fact that I have made so much an hour at other jobs. He was very rude and confrontational. I tried to explain that I didnít have a problem with the salary because I had been paid for a skill that I would not be using at this job, so I didnít expect to be paid for it. I pointed out that the salary was listed on the job ad, and that I knew when I applied that it was not a high-paying job. This was not the right move, as he took offence to the comment (Which was NOT what I intended). He said  ìYou would have to work here for at least 7 years before you  might  make $14 an hour.î (This job was full-time but offered no benefits, sickdays, or anything.) In the next breath he says ìBut we want someone who will stay with us, and it takes a long time to train someone.î That is true, and I understood that. For a business an employee is an investment in time and money and you want a return on that investment.    This was the tone of the whole interview. I felt like I had to just sit there and take blows from him like some bad kid who has been sent to the principal's office.  I began to wonder why they called me in the first place! The crowning touch was his final statement: ìWeíll call you later this week or you can just go out and sit out there and weíll let you know.î   (Why donít they just take you outside and beat you with a bat for half an hour? The end result is the same!)  My mom had a phone interview this week. The woman saw how much she had made at her last job (it was on her resume, so the woman had the information  before  she called) and then said "I don't think you will be happy working for $12/hr." and hung up.     Todayís Lesson: If someone is completely unsuitable for the job, then donít call them in for an interview and then subject them to a lecture about how unsuitable they are!

						   Just came back from an interview at a dot com here in town. Itís my third interview. I would really like to get this job since itís right up my alley. I live on message boards and I donít mind working behind a computer all day. Its also a growing company which is exciting. But I am not getting my hopes up. I am used to disappointment, and I am sure they have found someone better with so many people looking for work!   I have another interview today at a bead store. They need a ordering and billing person. Maybe that one will work out if the other job does not. (At any rate Iím going to be fried from all of these interviews!)

						    Doing Your Bit  Pat Tillman was killed in Afghanistan last week. He gave up a multimillion-dollar contract to play football so he could join the Army Rangers. He made the decision to serve his country after September 11th.   I had considered joining the military after Sep 11th, but I wanted to finish grad school first. I also thought I was too old to join up (I was 24 at the time). I also figured I was too short and weak and at one time the fact that I'm a girl would not have helped me any. Above all, Iím just a big fat coward. These were all lame excuses. I still desperately want to do something DIRECTLY to make life difficult for terrorists. I don't want to just wave flags while I sit on my fat ass watching reality TV. I want to get involved.    I have always been fascinated with WWII, especially with the soldiers (like my grandfather who was in the Battle of the Bulge), sailors, airmen, and even civilians (including those who served in a  clandestine capacity) who fought against fascist ideology and oppression. It must have been both exciting and terrifying to have such a tremendous cause to fight for. I want the chance to make a contribution to this fight too. I just donít know how.

						    So CloseÖ  The job search continues. Yes, I have a job right now, but Iím what they call ìUnderemployed.î  I am making less per hour at this job than I made at my very first temp job right out of undergraduate, and $4 less an hour than I was making before I left my other job to go to grad school.  I cannot afford to move out and get my own place, but if all goes well I could afford to buy a car and insurance/gas etc... On the upside, its better than the $5/hr I made at my first fast food job, and I may get health insurance after 6 months. (I pay $260 a month for continuing coverage that Iím going to lose in about 5 months.)    I finally had a breakthrough with my search for a Government job. I really want a permanent job with the Park or Forest service. I want to spend my days in a dark little office in bumf*** nowhere where I can do my work and not worry about the ups and downs of contract work. I got a call from a very nice archaeologist in Tucson who works for the Park Service. I was amazed when he offered me the job. Yes! I could move to Tucson! He even mentioned work at an historic period site near Tucson.  Then came the catch. I knew the job wasnít exactly full time, but it turned out that he could only guarantee that I would have work until the end of September. The job paid  $3.75 more an hour than I am currently making.) but there would be periods as long as two months in a row where there would be NO WORK at all.   To accept this job I would have to buy a car (I share one at the moment) and find a place to live by May 3rd . I almost felt like taking the leap, but the possible financial repercussions of going into debt for a car and then having no guarantee of work were too much for me. After some consideration I turned it down. It hurt me to do it, but it was too risky.    I had also applied for a job here in town. Full time, permanent work with great benefits. First permanent job I have seen for ages. I havenít heard from them, and the job closed last week.  Another opportunity lost.    I am seriously considering getting a GIS certificate. I havenít done this yet because I can just see investing time and money in yet another degree (Not a degree per say, its 16+ hours grad credit) only to be in a position where I canít find work again. I worry because all of the un/underemployed archaeologists end up doing GIS, so Iíll end up competing against the same people for the same few jobs, just in a different field.  Where are the jobs? If I were to start over as a frosh again, what would I do differently? It seems like things change so fast that once youíre trained for a job, it is obsolete or they send it overseas.

						    The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour: A Sign of the Apocalypse?    I tuned in to ABC tonight hoping to see Alias, but instead of Jennifer Garner swinging from a helicopter in a bright red wig with a Rambaldi artifact tucked under one arm, I saw Nick and Jessica. (The "Chicken of the Sea" Jessica and Nick.)  I had seen promos of this show for weeks and thought that it looked like a parody of the Sonny and Cher show from way back in the day (before my time).   To be honest, I only caught about 3 minutes of their opening act and it was so obnoxious that I turned it off. I am hoping that this show is meant to be a clever postmodern parody of a 1960's variety show yanked out of context to create an ironic juxtaposition between the wholesome TV of the past and the sex and violence on TV today (instead of simply a lame vehicle for Jessica and Nick).    Note:  ABC  did  air Alias after Nick and Jessica.   HAPPY EASTER and a HAPPY BIRTHDAY (April 12) to Dave Letterman (I know, he ain't here)

						    The Wax Lion   I found out last week that Wonderfalls was cancelled. Fox had decided to run ìEncore presentationsî of lame reality shows like The Swan in its place. I cannot imagine why the Fox suits think this crap is better than a brand new episode of a show like Wonderfalls. I guess it all boils down to ratings. Ratings = advertising $. I think they should have given Wonderfalls a longer run. How could it find its fan base when it was shown on Friday twice, (with a rerun of the first show on a Thursday) then again on a Thursday? I only knew about the move to Thursday because I looked online. I do recall seeing some promos for the show and did not think it looked promising. However I caught the last æ of the first show one night just by chance and got sucked in  (IIRC, the promos for the X-Files looked lame to me too, but I happened to catch a show and became hooked).  They filmed 13 episodes of Wonderfalls, the remaining 10 of which may never see the light of day. I deeply regret that I did not tape the three episodes that aired.      I broke my rule about not being a loser and signing online petitions. I signed the Wonderfalls petition and was surprised to see that, as of Friday evening, there were 11,700 signatures. I also signed up to suggest they release the rest of the episodes (ësodes?) on DVD.  I donít have any hope that it will do any good. Advertisers on Fox want millions, not 11,700 people to watch the show, and no one is going to go to the trouble of pressing a bunch of DVDs of a show that no one watched!   Wonderfalls was an excellent antidote to the ìReality TVî black hole that television has sunk into. I think Fox should have given it at least six weeks with more promotion and a mention of the critical acclaim that the show had garnered. I really believe that there are a lot of folks out there who would like this show if they ever got a chance to see it.

						   Well, am now gainfully (?) employed. Am employed at least. I have worked at my new job for almost two whole weeks. I like it so far. Not a lot of stress (which if course is why the pay is low), but the work can be slow at times.   On my second day or so this guy walks in while the broker was out (My desk is in the front room/reception area. The more important you are, the further your desk is from the front door). This guy starts out by insisting that he was in last week and that the broker had asked him to come back. He's selling office supplies door to door for a well-known office supply company. He tried to win points by saying that he is in the same church as the broker and assumed that the broker must buy things from him to help him out. He kept pressing me to "just get signed up for some toner" or something, and we would get a catalogue.  I was certainly not going to do anything like that. I just had to figure out how to get rid of him. Luckily my co-worker came in and politely told him that we bought supplies from X and that we didn't even order things very often so we didn't see any reason to switch to Y.    He didn't take the hint and kept pressing us, so finally I just asked him for his card and told him we would tell the broker that he had been in. This got rid of him for the moment at least. I wasn't in on the following Monday (Had jury duty) and apparently "Toner Boy" returned - twice.   Well this past week Toner Boy returned with "muscle" as he put it, a guy of some kind who was there to figure out why he couldn't seem to make a sale. The broker was there, but he is much to busy to be bothered with things like that, so again the co-worker and I had to try to get rid of him. While the co-worker went to talk to the broker about it (I think she just pretended to speak to him) Toner Boy asked me how long I had lived here. I replied "Twenty years" to which he replied: "You don't look old enough to have been here twenty years."    Ugh!  This is an example of the first sign of aging: men give you bullsh*t about how young you look. It's like when people tell someone who is ill that they look really good. You know it's a lie, and they woudn't even bother to say it if it were true.  It really ruined my whole day and Toner Boy is now at the top of my sh*t list (Ok, so Bin Laden is actually at the top at the moment, but Toner Boy is a close second or third).   Being the receptionist/secretary is a bit like being a bouncer or a guard dog, you have to be the filter between the outside world and the employer, both on the phone and in the office.  I have had to deal with telemarketers who pretend like they do business with us. The worst so far was a jerk from D&B (as I will refer to them) who wanted to speak with the broker (Whose name he didn't seem to know) about "Updating his business account information." He seemed annoyed when I didn't just forward him through, but asked for his name and number (Telemarketers hate that).  I have also started asking them if they currently have an account with us, and if they don't, then that's it. (They don't like that question either. )

						    The Bitter Boat   Just got turned down for two jobs in one day. Wow. Last year there were no jobs to apply for so I was saved the humiliation of being turned down. So far this year I have applied for several, got a phone interview for one, a real interview at another, nothing for the third, a job offer for the fourth. I applied for a National Park Service job in Tucson. A very nice gentleman from WACC called me and we talked about the work they would be doing this summer, including some historical archaeology near Tucson. I was practically drooling all over the phone. I really, really wanted to do it.  The pay was low, but I didn't care. It was archaeology.   The catch? The job was only guaranteed through September.  I would have to buy a car and move to Tucson for six months of work. After that I would be on and off furlough. I was so disappointed. I wished I were like my friend Kristy, who just lived in her old Bronco for several months when she started grad school. But I didn't even have a old Bronco to live in, and I was afraid to go into debt for even a very modest car when didn't know if I was going to be able to make the payments. I had to call him back and turn it down. It really hurt.       I know exactly what I want to do when I grow up, I just can't seem to find anyone who will hire me to do it.     People Skills.   I quit my clerical job last week. This was the  worst  job I have ever had, and I really, really, wanted it to work. The commute was short, and though the pay was low, the job was bearable. It was some kind of income until I find the archaeology position that I'm looking for. So why did I quit?   My boss had always treated me like I was a stupid child - literally. He never trusted me to do even simple things such as send a fax without his "help." This didn't worry me at first because I thought he would back off after I had been there for a while. I was eager to show him that I could work independently. After all, he had told me that this was the kind of employee he was looking for. I tried to get things done before he even asked for them. I never let him down, I always did what he asked, and he never complained about the quality of my work.  However, things did not get better. Whenever I sent a fax he just could not believe I managed to send it without jamming. He sat right next to me at my desk when he dictated letters and e-mails. Sometimes I didn't even have enough room on my desk to type. If he didn't like the way I was doing something he would take the mouse out of my hand and do it for me (even if I knew how to do it). It was very frustrating. He would also insist that I write down everything he said, and he wouldn't give me directions until I had pen and paper.   If you use Microsoft Office, then you know that there is usually about three ways you can carry out any command such as writing a formula in Excel or setting margins in Word. He would insist I did it  his  way, which was usually not the way I knew how to do it. I had no choice because he sat right next to me when I worked, and he would scold me and tell me I was wrong if I tried to do it differently.  I tried to do things his way if it was faster or more efficient than the way I did it.   I finally decided that I needed to talk to him. I told him that it made me very nervous when he sat next to me when I worked.   His response (paraphrasing here): "I know it makes you nervous, but it doesn't bother me that it makes you nervous and frustrated." Then he went on to say: "There is more than one way to do something."   Right! This was exactly the point I was trying to make. However, it soon became apparent that there was more than one way as long as it was  his  way. So having been defeated on that point, I decided to bring up my second concern. I told him that I didn't feel like he trusted me to do my job and I didn't know why.   His response: "Because I don't think you know how to do it."  It would have been better if he had said I was ugly and I smelled bad.  I knew exactly what I was doing, but because I didn't do it  his   way, he had assumed I didn't know how to do it at all.  I gave my notice.   He tried to talk me into staying, and then he went off about how he had 8 years of college and how he went to grad school (I never told him I have an MA). He told me he learned such and such about software in college. So I pointed out to him that I knew how to write formulas in Excel because I had used it in stats in school.   His response: "Doesn't count! Doesn't count in the real world!"   Ok, so let me get this straight:  Your   college experience counts, but mine doesn't? That makes sense. He also went on to tell me that I could learn valuable "people skills" from him because he's so good with people (I sh*t you not).   I take pride in working hard and doing a good job. I don't need to be told I'm doing a good job, but I refuse to work for someone with such a low opinion of my abilities and intelligence (unless it's a job that I really want to keep). Especially since I know damn well how to it. Sometimes you just have to suck it up, but not for this particular job. He actually made me feel worse about myself than I did when I was unemployed.  I went in the next morning and left my keys and a note. I was going to leave him this:   "After thinking about our conversation yesterday I have decided that I cannot work for __________ anymore. Since I am obviously so incompetent, I am sure that my departure will be of no inconvenience to you."   But I decided to take the high road and leave a simple note. I hated doing this, and I don't ever want to do it again. I just want to find a job and stay. The last job I quit was 8 years ago at a fast food joint. I had been there 7 months, which is practically a lifetime in fast food. I hate instability, and I really just want to get a job and stay there so that I can buy a car, move out, etc...

						    Home Improvement    I wish I would have started this earlier, but I have been busy. We are trying to have the tile and carpet in our house replaced with ceramic tile. We have had 1200 sq. ft. of the house tiled which covers the master bed and bath, foyer, family room, hallway, kitchen, and second bath. The bedrooms, living room and dining room will have new carpet.   Finding a contractor was a nightmare. We had several come and take measurements, but never call us back with an estimate. We got wildly different measurements for square footage from every single contractor who did call us back with an estimate. This made buying the tile difficult. We picked the second highest estimate and added 10% to be safe. Weíll see how much we have left over. If we have any, we may tile a bedroom and tile around the tub/ shower in the second bath.   We are also having a custom "neo-angle" shower built in the master bath, and had to find matching porcelain tile listelle for the shower. Since the shower was being replaced, we also decided to replace all of the fixtures, since the ones we have are original and are 16 years old. It took my mom FOREVER and many changes of opinion before she finally settled on the brushed nickel and gold fixtures. Then there were the shower doors. She finally picked a set of  nearly frameless doors.   We are also trying to get new light fixtures in the bathroom and two ceiling fans for the bedroom installed. This has also proved to be more difficult that it should be. The two men who have agreed to do installation have backed out at the last minute, and now we're on contractor #3. He says heíll be there next Friday. Until then, its getting hot, and I have a box with a fan in it on my bedroom floor that is just collecting dust.    Demolition day was last Monday. Our house looked like some kind of biohazard zone; everything was covered in huge sheets of plastic. The demo went well, and was not nearly as bad as we had feared. However fine white dust is everywhere, and its so fine that it goes right through the vacuum cleaner bag. Today the second bathroom was torn out. We had to make sure that we had at least ONE toilet and shower or bath. Most of the tile is in, and the grout is drying.   I started this blog topic because I have heard that such projects usually tend to be nightmarish, and I was thinking I would be posting all of the ugly details here. For example, 20 years ago when my parents bought their first house here the toilet in my bathroom leaked (brand new home). So the builder sent someone to come in and reseat it. When they reseated the toilet they ruined the linoleum floor, so the flooring guys came in to put in a new floor. In so doing, they scratched the tub. When the guy came in to buff the scratch out of the fiberglass tub, the fiberglass dust permeated the wood of the cabinets and could not be cleaned off. So they had to come back and replace the doors. All this for a leaky can. Fortunately everything has gone so well that there hasn't really been anything to Blog about. I downloaded Hello today and I hope to post photos of the new work when I get a chance.

						    The Job Search ñ again   It's time to start looking for any kind of job again. I have given up on the last archaeology job that I interviewed for. They sent me an email about a week later that said that they were looking at other people. I took this as my "Sorry Charlie" and let it go. A week after that they sent me another email. I almost didn't open it. This one said "Things are moving slowly, we'll let you know in 1-2 weeks." That was about 4 weeks ago. Why don't people just suck it up and send you a proper "Sorry Charlie" email or just say nothing at all?  It's very rude.    Misleading Job Ads ñ again!   I wish there were a law about placing bogus or misleading job ads in the paper. Before I got the job at the real estate brokerage, I applied for an entry-level "management" job. I received a call from an outfit called "Gl*b*l Marketing" who wanted to schedule me for an interview for a management position "to manage an office of 10-15 people." I asked her what the company did, and she said they sold perfume. I had just seen a story on the local news about perfume marketing scams. I got ready to go to the interview anyway, hoping that maybe it was legit, but decided against it and called to cancel. Several days later I received a call from them again wanting to schedule me for an interview. I told them I had already been scheduled and I had cancelled. The girl at the other end gave me a snotty "good luck" and hung up.   When I started the job at the brokerage, one of my co-workers told me she had answered one of those ads and actually went in for an interview. Turns out it's not an interview at all. They herd everyone into a big room and give them a sales pitch. She was v. pissed of for wasting time and effort on it.   Yesterday I replied to an ad in the paper that read: "Admin Asst. Will Train New office needs help. No Exp. Necc." This morning I get a call from a girl that sounds like she's 12 years old trying to schedule an interview with a company called "F*v* St*r Marketing" because they need "Managers for an office of 10-15 people." Just like the last marketing "job" I accidentally applied for.  I told her "No thank you," but I should have asked to speak to her supervisor and to ask him or her why they place misleading ads in the newspaper! I feel stupid for falling for it!

						    A Small Victory   I finally heard about the archaeological project I carried out a few months ago. It was the first time I had done an entire project from start to finish on my own. At my last (real) job we always had our draft reports reviewed by at least one person, and usually two before they went out, so I had another archaeologist review the report and make suggestions before it was submitted. It went through the DOT and SHPO with no problems and no comments. This is a small victory! Now if I can just find a job where I can do something like this (anything archaeology-related) full time...

The company who does their on-site tech support has a network problem earlier this week. Somehow they managed to get a guy out to the house yesterday (Tues) to install the new HD. So far so good.

						    Tech Support Saga   My dad bought a D*ll computer this last January for Christmas. We have owned a D*ll before (a 486). It was a good computer and we had no complaints with the tech support. So when he went to buy our newest computer, he decided that the machine he wanted was a D*ll.(We have owned a G*t*w*y and two C*mp*qs too) We ordered it and it arrived very quickly, and all in one piece despite a warning that parts may arrive separately.   Starting in March he began to have weird error messages starting with the computer refusing to boot up. Multiple use of Ctrl+alt+del was the only way to get it going. Then we got an UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME error. I got it working simply by turning it off and letting it sit. This advice was obtained by Goggling the error message. It was the least invasive of methods suggested to repair the problem, including a confusing article on a version of this error code posted on Microsoft's site.  Then we got a string of IDE and SATA drive failure messages on bootup (We don't have a SATA drive). It was like the BIOS settings kept changing. I called D*ll's tech support and of course they blamed the error on us, and gave suggestions on how to fix it. I'll spare you the details, but since march I have had to call D*ll once or twice a month for hard drive-related errors. At one point I was even instructed to open the case and unplug the drive to clear the static from it (or so they said). The tech promised us this would solve the problem and that if it happened again they would replace our hard drive.   No matter what the problem is the techs invariably blame it on a phantom corrupted file, new software/hardware (in spite of the fact that none was installed), or "power surges".  I find this interesting because we have two other computers in the house and none of them have had any of these "very common" problems.   We were pretty tired of these bootup errors by the time we received another UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME error this last weekend. I spent the evening on the phone with a tech who was giving me bullshit about how I probably messed up Windows XP by opening a corrupted email (it's the phantom corrupted file again!). We know better than to open emails with files attached to them. I asked him if he could see the history of calls for this system and pointed out to him that the common denominator in all of the problems was the hard drive (or the HD controller?). I also pointed out that I have an H*wl*tt P*ck*rd with XP and I have never had a problem like this with it. This didn't seem to make any sort of impression however, and he made me use the Windows XP disk to run Chkdsk on the hard drive, which he claimed was to fix the phantom file that I had so carelessly corrupted by opening an email. He assured me that he would call me in an hour after the chkdsk was done running and that the computer would reboot.   2 hours later and no call from D*ll support, chkdsk had quit 25% of the way through due to errors, and the system still refused to reboot. Out of desperation I tried restarting it, pressing F12 at the D*ll screen where I had seen a place where you can run a diagnostic on the hard drive. When I did so it said it had failed, and I got a "code 7" or something like that. I had no idea what this meant, but I called D*ll back. The woman told me to do exactly what I had just done (F12, IDE check) and I told her I had got a 7. "Oooh." She says. "Your hard drive has failed."    Really?! Might we have a bad hard drive? I would never have guessed it after four months of sporadic HD errors!! So my dad gets on the line with this woman and she tells him how they are going to do the HD replacement. She gave him a phone number for the company that sends out techs to do the work, and a case number. She assured us they would call on Monday to schedule an appointment.   Monday comes and no call. I call the phone number the D*ll tech support woman gave me and I get a "This number has been disconnected" message. I call D*ll customer support to complain. She gives me another number to call.  I call it and get a woman with a very bad attitude who tells me that their network is down so they can't tell me anything.   So that's where we are.

						   I haven't blogged on anything political in a while because to be honest, I haven't been quite sure what to say.  I don't know what to think about Iraq. I'm not sure we will really know what effect it will have on the world until we have it well behind us. We were told that we were going to war for reasons that do not seem to have been valid. That is not to say that I am certain that we were intentionally misled. We are not privy to all of the intelligence (good or bad) that is available to President Bush, so we might see it differently if we had the whole picture.   If I sound a bit wishy-washy about this it's because I am.  I cannot pretend to know enough to have a really informed opinion on this. This is not because I neglect the news. I read the BBC online and watch the evening news every night. Still, I feel like I am not getting the whole story. Partly because as I said above, the public cannot be told everything that goes on in the world, but more importantly, I do not think the press is willing to present issues in a fair way.   I have noticed that the evening news (CBS, NBC and ABC) tend to present news with a particular slant. Sometimes it's subtle and sometimes it isn't. For example, two prominent news anchors could not even put aside their feelings during the funeral services for President Reagan. One anchor practically blamed 9/11 on Reagan, and the other used Reagan's example to show us how badly Bush Junior is doing. This was entirely inappropriate.     It is not the job of the press to tell us what to think ,  despite what some people might believe.  Their job is to report daily events as fairly as possible and let us make up our own minds.    I am trying to make up my mind about the upcoming election and the media situation is not helping me. I am shocked by what I see going on in the current administration, but at the same time I am getting that information from a media who presents them in the worst possible light. My only other source of news is the administration itself with all of their spin, or campaign ads that are very misleading. The truth must lie somewhere in between.

						   I have just been watching the funeral for President Reagan. I was moved by Nancy Reaganís goodbye to her husband. I felt very strange watching it all. It felt so private and personal.   I don't remember anything specific about President Reagan. The first national election that I can remember was for his second term. I was eight at the time. I remember that I wanted him to win.   But I never understood what impact he had in the fight against Communism. I knew we were supposed to hate the Soviets and that they could kill us all in a moment if they wanted. I also knew that we would do the same to them. I was not as frightened as I should have been. I remember hearing about Star Wars and how I wanted to believe that we really had such a thing. I just could not believe that anyone could destroy America.     My best friend's brother used to try to scare us by telling us that the Soviets had a bunch of missiles aimed right at our city because we had an Air Force base (two, actually).  I remember him describing what would happen if we were bombed; he told us that all the lights would go out because the bomb would suck up all of the electricity.  Several years later we read "Z for Zechariah" in class. By then I was old enough to have some idea of how much danger we were really in. The following year the Berlin Wall fell.    I wasn't paying much attention to world events so I didn't think about President Reagan when the Wall fell, but I had been following some of the changes in the Soviet Union. I saw that there was hope in Gorbachev's reforms.  I was aware that the Soviet grip on power was loosening, but I didn't really know why. I have only recently learned about the role that President Reagan played in lifting the Iron Curtain from Eastern Europe and the years of peace and prosperity that followed.

						    The Democratic Convention.    I would blog about it, but first of all I havenít been watching, and secondly there are many other bloggers who are far more qualified to blog about it. Kerry gave his big speech last night. I didnít watch it. Why not? Talk is cheap. (I wonít be watching W either.)  I was not impressed by what little I saw during the Democratic convention. For years the Democrats have promised us better schools, better jobs, and better healthcare, and for years they have failed to deliver on their promises. The Republicans, however, for good or bad, usually make some kind of an effort to draft legislation and try to get it passed. That is not to say that I always like what they do, especially when it comes to issues like abortion and education.      I will most likely be moved one way or the other by the past actions of the candidates. W has shown us what he can do as president (!).  Kerry is harder to read, and if what I have heard is true, I donít think I want him as president either. But I will vote for one of them and hope I donít end up regretting it later. I need to spend more time looking into our representatives. I think it is easy to forget how important the Congress really is. When we blame the President for our problems we must remember that heís not the only one in charge in Washington, and that our enlightened Forefathers put together a system that spreads power among the branches of Government for this reason. Blame or praise should not fall on the head of one individual; screw ups and victories are usually group efforts.

						    Weasley is our King      I found  urlLink this website  by accident. It has some fascinating theories on the HP books. One explores how the chess game in The Philospher's/Sorcerer's Stone is a metaphor for the second war and another argues that Ron = Dumbledore. I am still a bit skeptical, but I liked it. I know hardcore HP fans know this stuff already, but it's MY blog and it's new to me!     Oh and according to  urlLink muggle.net  JKR says Tom=Voldemort so Tom does not = Half Blood Prince.

						    Media Bias - Again      You may have heard this (but probably not)  that Sandy Berger, the National Security Advisor to Clinton ( urlLink and an advisor to the Kerry campaign until this story broke )  urlLink is alleged to have removed documents from the National Archives  relating to the Clinton Administrations' reactions to Al-Qaeda. Berger insists it was an honest mistake. However, he was supposedly seen stuffing documents in his clothing (pants?!) and multiple copies of a report that he wrote went missing. How does one "accidently" pick up and lose several copies of a report?     This story, if true, is disgusting on many levels. It appears that he is trying to cover for mistakes made during Clinton's term by stealing and destroying documents that  belong to the American people.  They are part of our history, regardless of how damaging they may be. It is also another example of the level to which people in the past administration would stoop to cover their  mistakes.     This story should be getting a LOT of press, but it isn't. Why not? The Democratic convention is soon and the liberal bias of the evening network news as as thinly disguised as ever. If this theft were the work of someone in the Bush administration it would be all over the news. I don't want the media to support Bush, I don't want them to support Kerry, I just want them to please TRY to be as fair as possible. As I have said before, where do I get my news when I have a choice of the smarmy "balanced" liberal media or overtly polemic (and scary!) conservative talk radio?!       I couldn't even find a decent online newspaper article to link to. They buried the details of the allegations against Berger in the VERY END of the article after much ink was spilt over how the timing of the news leak was suspicious (it is) and how the 9/11 report is going to be damaging to Bush.   One article even had a Kerry campaign ad next to it!

						    The Half Blood Prince    Tthis is the title of Rowlingís 6th book. Who is the Half Blood Prince? There is rampant speculation on  urlLink Muggle.net  as to who this prince is. The possibilities are bounded by Rowlingís definition of ìHalf-Blood.î Does it mean a ìmudblood,î or does it refer to an individual who has a link to a royal lineage within the wizard world? Perhaps this individual is a pure blood wizard but is not full-blooded royalty. JKR has never suggested this in any of the books so far.    I would like to think itís Neville Longbottom, but if we operate under the known definition of pure blood, then Neville is out because heís a pureblood wizard. Could it be Hagrid? Perhaps the scruffy but noble Remus Lupin? (Rowling stated in a chat that he is a half blood) Or maybe itís someone we donít know of yet?     One hypothesis on Muggle.net is that it  has  to be a character from the second book because JKR almost used this title for the second book. JKR has said itís not Harry or Voldemort, and Lupin made his debut in the third book. It has also been suggested that Tom Riddle may be the Prince. This requires us to separate the human Tom Riddle from the evil being that he later became. I donít know if this separation is possible in JKRís world or not (This is starting to sound like those crazy French folks [see below]). A line from CoS (Chamber of Secrets) makes this seem unlikely:  ìVoldemort,î said Riddle softly, ìIs my past, present, and future, Harry PotterÖî  (American paperback p. 313).  I think itís fun to speculate and to read the ideas of other fans.      6  LONG  years of Latin and my minor in Classics have come in handy for interpreting things in the Harry Potter books.   (Of course it's the only use I have gotten out of them.)

						    Another V. Minor Note on the Harry Potter PoA Film.   (SPOILERS) I forgot to mention this. I got a kick out of the part when Harry was looking for Pettigrew in the hall and he runs into Snape. The pictures on the walls are complaining about the light from their wands because it's night and they are trying to sleep. At the end of the scene Snape is standing there with his glowing wand (!) and a picture turns to him and says: "Are you deaf!? PUT THAT LIGHT OUT!"  I am probably reading too much into this, but I think this is a reference to the British TV series "Dad's Army." I have been reading about British Civil Defence during WWII, including a book by Mike Brown called "Put That Light Out! Britain's Civil Defence Services at War 1939-1945."

						    The Second Worst Interview Ever    My adventures in interviewing are a regular part of the Bitter Boat, and here is my latest:   I have very little experience interviewing. My very first interview wasn't good. It was at a small local bookstore. I think I was in High School or fresh out of school at the time. The man asked me if I had a customer at the front desk and one on the phone what do I do? I replied that you put the one on hold and help the costumer up front. Wrong. He was not at all kind about it either, and basically said I'd ruin him if he let me work for him.   My second "interview" was for a fast food job. Got the job that day.  My third job (a temp job) was offered to me sight unseen two weeks after I graduated from college with my BA. I got my fourth job two weeks after I finished the third. I had a great interview and was offered the job right there. My latest temp jobs were similar. I knew someone at one company so she hired me based on that.   I have had no luck since then. After several interviews that seemed like they went very well, but produced no results, I decided to check out a bunch of interview guides from the library like "Interviewing for Dummies," "How not to look like a total and Complete Idiot at Your Interview,î etc... I read them all and took the advice. Be positive always. Answer every harsh negative question with an answer that would make Pollyanna look like Scrooge. Love everyone. Have no major faults, only little small ones. Turn every negative into a positive.  I took the advice and practiced it. I studied. I prepared. I went in and was doing fairly well until he said:  "Can you do something for me?"   Uh oh. This wasn't in the book.   "Answer the phone."   There was a telephone by my seat. I thought: ìOk, this is weird, but no problem.î I had just spent two months doing the phones at my last job. I picked up the phone and to my astonishment nothing but total gibberish came out of my mouth. It was a string of noises that did not correspond to words in the English language. I put the receiver down and smiled.  "Let me try again." I tried to laugh it off and regain my composure. I picked up the receiver and could not, for the life of me, pronounce the name of the company. Again, odd sounds issued from my lips as if I were speaking a mysterious ancient language.  I have had to do presentations in front of people before but I practice. I have always feared that freeze-up that happens to some people, but I haven't had this problem in a long time. This is because I PREPARE for hours. I have it down cold before I open my mouth. This is not to say that I am a great speaker, but I can manage fairly well. The phone caught me off guard, even though it was a perfectly reasonable request.         That of course was the end of that. He did keep talking to me for about 10 more minutes, talking about benefits, etc. But I knew it was just a waste of our time. Why torture me with a spiel about the great benefits I   would have had   had I been able to say "This is Blah Blah and Associates how may I help you?"

						    Notes on The Prisoner of Azkaban    I saw the latest Harry Potter film last week. I wasnít sure what to expect since I had not read any reviews. I immediately noticed the look of the film. There were so many small details to notice, and the overall mood was a bit different. I have since read that some people donít like the new sets, which are a bit harsher than the old ones. I disagree, the sets seemed more realistic and magical in a less sugary way.   The only thing I knew going in was that I probably wasnít going to like Lupin. Professor Remus Lupin is my v. favorite Harry Potter character.  I found out before the movie was released that David Thewlis was playing Lupin. I have only seen him in The Singing Detective (1986 mini series) where he had a small part as a soldier on a train, and in one of the Prime Suspect series. I had serious doubts about this casting choice solely based on his physical appearance. This was incredibly shallow on my part, and I seem to have ignored the lessons that JKR has woven into the HP books about about prejudice. There is  nothing  about the way JKR described Lupin in her books that would suggest that David Thewlis looked wrong for the part.     Thewlis won me over completely. He  WAS  Remus Lupin, and though he may not have looked like  my idea  of the part, he acted it perfectly and I cannot imagine anyone else doing it.   For the record, I also liked his 1920ís (?) clothing and his appreciation of swing music, which were not in the book. Gambonís Dumbledore (Michael Gambon was also in The Singing Detective) didnít quite have the twinkle that Richard Harris gave him, but he wasnít given much of a chance to shine. I hope he will have a bigger part in GoF.   WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD:   I liked how this film focused on the relationships of the characters but it left out some important details that I think would make the film confusing to the uninitiated. Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were never explained or how the Maraudersí map came to be. Harry thinks the person across the lake making the Patronus is his father. I do not think this was explained at all in the film. I liked the film despite these deficiencies. It had an edge that the other films lacked, but I worry about how they are going to fit all of the relevant stuff from The Goblet of Fire into the next film.

						    Deconstructing Harry   I have recently found a Harry Potter site that I have yet to fully explore. Itís called  urlLink mugglenet.com . I did however find this  urlLink article   from the New Zealand Herald about how French intellectuals with too much time on their hands are deconstructing Harry Potter. They have put the Boy Who Lived through the Structural-Marxist (or something like that) grinder and cannot seem to agree if he is a neo-liberal capitalist (?!), or a pro-third world anti-globalist tree hugger.   The big question is: If Harry were an archaeologist, what sort of archaeologist would he be?  Would he be a processual archaeologist or some variety of post-processualist? Hermione could convince him to take up Feminist archaeology or the archaeology of house elves though a Marxist lens (in the article they cite his Marxist leanings over House Elves). Perhaps he would be a Behavioral archaeologist and carry out magical experiments on pottery or garbage. Does he agree with Kuhnís views on paradigm shifts, and how does this affect his view of archaeology as a science?  The possibilities are endless, but unfortunately I donít really feel like thinking about this long enough to come up with something clever. Maybe the 7th Harry Potter book will be titled: "The Secret of the Hermeneutic Circle."

						    Election Stuff   They have just reported on the news that Al-Qaeda and "Old Fuzzy Face" (UBL) may want to disrupt or influence our elections, as they did in Spain. If there is ever a time NOT to miss an election, it would be this one. I was going to vote anyway, but now I  have  to, especially if it can be taken as flipping a big bird to the terrorists.  To be honest, I haven't quite decided whom to vote for yet. I just heard some interesting things about Kerry's military record today. If true, IMHO, he is no better than Bush when it comes to his military record!  I'll post the link to the article if I ever find it. My dad got it somewhere from a site claims to be  "subverting the mainstream press." (Translation: It's Conservative)   Dream Team   I still wish that we could have a McCain / Biden ticket. I know one is a Republican (sort of) and one is a Democrat (sort of), but both of them seem to have their heads in the right place and seem to actually know what is going on. I think I like these two because I am sort of a conservative Democrat / liberal Republican. I'm in the middle and have never been quite sure what party I should belong to. I guess I'm an Independent, and that is why I recently re-registered. Being an Independent does not mean I will always vote for the third party candidate. I think that this is usually foolish, and it just splits the vote. To me being an Independent means that you don't have to slavishly vote along a certain party line. Being an Independent means that I will vote for whomever I think will do the best job, regardless of their party affiliation.      Bridget Jones Returns   The  urlLink trailer  for Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is up. It's a very short trailer-ette.  I have made it clear how I feel about Colin Firth, so needless to say, I'm anxious to see this movie, even if it is a dreaded sequel.

						    Tech Support Update II   A guy from D*ll came by yesterday and replaced the motherboard, CD-ROM and DVD drives and all cables. Hopefully this will solve the problem once and for all.

						    Tech Support Saga Revisited.    About three days ago my dad's D*ll computer had another serious problem. He started it up and it was unable to read the DVD and CD-ROM drives. They just were not there!  D*ll just replaced the hard drive about three weeks ago, and the computer wasn't even used for a week because we were away on vacation. It worked for about 7 days before this happened.   I called D*ll tech support and was instructed to monkey around with the cables. For some reason they assume everyone carries their desktop computer around with them everywhere they go and they kick them around and use them for target practice or something, because they ALWAYS make you open it up and reseat the cables.  How does a cable become loose while the thing sits quietly on a desk all day?!   I did this and then the tech in India gave up and forwarded us to a guy in Tennessee. I guess D*ll employs a few Americans. This guy made me monkey around with the cables again, but I at least understood why. He was testing the connectors and cables. The verdict? The drives are daisy-chained on one ribbon cable that plugs into the motherboard. The plug on the motherboard was OK (We hooked the HD to it and it worked) however, the CD or DVD would ONLY run if hooked up independently, not together.  So at the moment the DVD drive is disconnected because that's the way the tech had us leave it. At least we can use the CD-ROM this way.  My dad told the guy in Tennessee about the hard rive crashing too. How the computer refused to recognize the drive several times before it failed altogether. After hearing this, the tech ordered us a new DVD, CD-ROM cables and even a new motherboard in case thew installer needs it. They will supposedly be coming Friday to install it. This computer was purchased new, directly from D*ll in January of this year, and it has not worked for more than two weeks straight without a problem.

						    Potterpotheses   I have decided that because I have the time, Iíll start adding my crazy Harry Potter hypotheses to this Blog. Millions of fans havenít been able to crack JKRís story yet, so why should I be able to shed any light on anything? I donít expect that I will, but I might as well post my thoughts. I have not read a lot of analysis of the books and my degree is in Anthropology, not Lit so I will probably make a mess of this.  SPOILERS ABOUND!!!     Sometimes a moon is just a moon.    Remus Lupinís boggart is usually described as a ìsilvery white orb.î The students in his DADA (Defence against the Dark Arts) class think itís a crystal ball when they see it during their boggart lesson. He is also described as fleeing from Professor Trelawney when she tried to give him a reading on her crystal ball. After reading PoA I had thought that JKR used this vague description of his boggart to make sure that it wasnít obvious early on that he was a werewolf, and the boggart was not a crystal ball, but a full moon.  However, there is some possibility that the silvery orb may not be a moon. This occurred to me as I re-read the books recently, and it was also suggested by someone in one of the forums.  Is the orb a moon, or is it in fact a crystal ball or a globe like those housed in the Department of Mysteries (DoM)?  Did he flee from Trelawney because sheís a weird old bat or because he had a fear of what he might see in her crystal ball? If this is the case, here are two possibilities:  1.  IIRC, only part of the staff (Snape, and Dumbledore) knew he was a werewolf, so perhaps he feared Trelawney would out him.  (To me this is the most likely.)  2. There is something he fears in his future, perhaps a prophesy like the one about LV.  I still think itís a just a moon, especially since the boggart in the film is obviously a moon. But itís still fun to speculate.  Speaking of moons, JKRís official site is covered in crescent moons. Some say this is a reference to the eventual demise of Remus Lupin. I would like to think that it means that our dear Remus is the Half Blood Prince, however, it could just as easily refer to  LUNA  Lovegood.

						    Shipping ñ Potter Style   I can recall as if it were yesterday   Öyes the X-Files ìfolderî on AOL a decade ago. I have to admit I was a Mulder/Scully ìshipper.î This was my introduction to fan ìshippingî (the act of wanting certain characters to become romantically involved). There were also Scully/Skinner, Scully/Frohike, Scully/Smoking Man even Skinner/Mulder ìshippersî out there on AOL all waiting with bated breath for the moment when their two favorite characters would succumb to their secret smoldering desires on screen. If this did not happen, or if it were happening with the wrong person, these shippers produced copious amounts of fan fiction describing the torrid trysts of their chosen ship.  I had all but forgotten about shipping until I started reading several Harry Potter forums. You have not seen shipping until you have sailed the HMS Harry Potter.  One board has a ìLove Threadî which I naively thought had something to do with JKRís overarching theme of love  (which I strongly suspect is ìthe power the Dark Lord knows not.î OotP Am ver. p. 841). But no, the Love Thread is located in bloody shark-infested waters where many ships are engaged in a fierce and endless battle. I have not had the courage to venture into this thread, but I have heard stories from those who have (and have lived to tell about it).   When shipping comes up in conversation on other threads they can range from the possible: Harry/Hermione and Ron/Hermione, to the ridiculous (and downright creepy) like Luna/Lupin. Why not have Trelawney and Remus steaming up the olí Shrieking Shack?  How about Mrs Norris/Crookshanks (a bit slashy, that), Mundungus/McGonagall, Snape brewing up a little love potion for Dolores Umbridge, or Filch/Peeves?                  Quite a few fans have pointed out that Nymphadora Tonks is the most eligible female character because of her age and therefore is the figurehead of many ships.  urlLink Check out this very amusing cartoon  about Tonks and her unfortunate shipability.  I refuse to be on the crew of any ship. I think that the overall story is more important, and only if the ship were key to it would I jump aboard. Although, to be honest I wouldnít mind seeing Professor Lupin find love- even if it is with poor TonksÖ

						    Loser   I applied for an archaeology/GIS job a couple of weeks ago. It was an entry-level job, which I thought improved my chances of getting an interview. No GIS degree required, just BA in anthropology or related. I even knew one of the people at the company. I had most of the experience they were looking for and I thought I was a good fit so I was hopeful. I just received an email today that they have hired someone. I am very disappointed since I didnít even get an interview.  I am getting very, very, depressed. It makes you feel worthless and hopeless after a while. You start wondering if itís you. You start wondering silly things like ìIs it because Iím short?î ìIs it because Iím female?î ìIs it because I have bad hair?î  ìAm I just a nut who canít do anything useful?î  In the meantime I have been trying to focus on pointless things like reading Colin Firth and Harry Potter forums (Whoís the Half Blood Prince!?) to keep me occupied. I have been writing stories and I have been reading, but sometimes I just get overwhelmed, esp. when I go online to look for jobs (not archy jobs, just  anything) . I just donít know what to do.
