      Ok. Welcome everybody to the blog of fadefast.co.uk. in it i'll ramble wildly about stuff to do with work, life and love generally.   The random gubbins below is all my testing, of this evening, in work and when i first set it up.  Mass respect to blogger.com - it's actually a really good system (when it gets its ass into gear!) and the bonus is i can add stuff when i'm in work and bored off my tree :-)  Ok, bye for now - I'm actually off on a weeks hols now so no updates for a little while! Keep checking back thou!  Paul

      right then. now it's time for me to get this thing back up and running, seeing as i've been linked to!   tech update: there should (should!) now be comments added for the blog. thanks to http://www.enetation.co.uk/ for that. bloggers - check it out.  I think I am *still* hung over from the weekend. A class event, and the meal at TGI's is something to be remembered for quite some time. Uncontrollable giggling from Lev, Simon, Pat and me made it a great time. Plus Lev's Last Show deserves a mention - as being the most messed up show in the world ever. Taking all the CD's, minidiscs and records from the studio, killing Sue, and letting him fill. Oh yes :)  OK, s'pose I'd better look like I'm doing some work now. Another week of fun filling envelopes I suspect...

      OK, so I have been very bad at updating this thing. Going to start now I think!  Didn't work on sunday - bonus. All got cancelled. So instead I went over to Warwick and had much fun with Paulyg, Cheryl, Stu, Saaaaaaaaaaahmon, RTJ and assorted others. Was great to see the old crowd again. Hopefully will be doing it again in a few weeks!  Current things of interest are BigBrother, my shiny new T68, and Ems (obviously) who has just gone on hols to St Tropez for two weeks. Am I jealous? Yup.  By the way, waiting now for my T68 to return from the CPW people - with T68i software! Yay! Should be quality. Get to pick it up this evening :)  Currently working in a department that is not my own. I am sticking labels to envelopes. Joy. There must be machines that do this?

      Well I'm back after a crazy crazy week in the emerald isle. A fantastic time was had, a perfectly relaxing and lovely week. Spent a bit of time in Cork, Killarney, West Cork, lots of lovely scenery, 40 shades of green and wicked company - the best in the world in fact!  But now I'm back in brum, at work, and loving it... not!  Really tired... might just crash out this weekend, we'll see.

      What a crazy few days. A few quite worrying things have been announced in the past few days (see  urlLink www.kpmg.co.uk ) and so it's going to be an interesting few months.   Aaaaaaaanyway, the sun is shining, the birds are singing - or at least they would if there were any in the centre of Birmingham - and I'm going to be moving house shortly. More details to follow.....  OK, off to buy CDs on the internet. Hurrah for music!

      Hmm. Been kinda slow with this thing. Didn't realise it would be such a pain in the arse to keep updated! Ah well.  Fun fun fun for me on a course this week. Have nearly fallen asleep a number of times. Ho hum.  Also found out today the exact details of a course I'm supposed to be group-leading next week. A 2-day-er with a load of 6thformers from some college in Birmingham, teaching them about management skills.  1) *I* don't have management skills. 2) They probably don't want to listen 3) I'm not that impressed.  Oh well, 2 days out of the office I suppose. Then just a few days to survive before I go on holiday again! Yay!  Back to the dodgy Shipman drama on ITV1 then......

      Oops. Seems as if again I've almost forgotten about my blog. Must.... make..... effort......  Ah well. OK, news at the moment? The Day Of Reckoning In Which We Will All Be Judged is approaching, and is in fact on Monday. Joy of joys. It's gonna be a weird day in the office that day.   And just to make it more interesting, I have an exam too on that morning. Which is why I am at home now, "revising". At least, I'm going to have started by ten, yes, that is my mission.  Onto more pleasurable things. Have you seen that VW Beetle ad? The one with the really  really  haunting music? Well, the song is by "Aqualung" and it urlLink ' s called "Strange and Beautiful". It was available properly (ie legally) on the net, but now it's more difficult to find. I say  more  difficult, because it's not totally impossible. In fact, very easy, if you switch your brain on.....  What other links can I tell you about? Erm, dunno really! S'pose I should get up and start work. Yes. That's what I'll do. Back later no doubt.   And if you are reading this and are bored, then COMMENT! It's not hard! COMMENTS ARE GOOD!   Thanks.

      La. I don't seem to have updated this thing like, forever. But I've been busy, that's my excuse.  So, I've moved, and knackered my ankle in the process. I am limping everywhere, but at least it is getting a bit of sympathy! The house is great and is slowly but surely being sorted out, will get cable tv and phone on Sunday, so I finally get my internet access back! I miss email........  Then I go back to college. Great! Will do the pre-course reading at the weekend I guess, not really in the mood for it but it'll get done.   Find out if I get to keep my job on 2 Sept. Hopefully everything will be OK and normal service will resume from then on. Until then, however, it'll be preying on my mind.....

      Well this post comes live from my adopted room just outside Cork in Ireland. Studying hard as ever (!) whilst listening to some quality radio -  urlLink RedFM ,  urlLink 2fm , and  urlLink 96  to name but three. All good fun!   No news really, apart from I am scared at the roaming bill I'm going to have when I get back. I've had more pointless calls from work this week than ever before I'd think!  Er, what else is going on? We went to the cinema last night and saw The Bourne Identity, quite liked it! Think it'll be a night of pizza and DVDs tonite, go out for dinner tomorrow night then out on the lash Friday. Lol, how quickly a week can be explained away!  Come on  urlLink BlueYonder ! Your web mail is being very slow today! Sort it out, how else am I supposed to keep contact with people?? Hmmm?

      Oh, such a long week! It's amazing how slowly time goes when you're waiting for a certain day or a certain even to come around, isn't it?  Working at a client site for the first time in what seems like ages, and feeling pretty tired about it all to be honest. But I have a week away next week (see earlier sentence!) which is going to be really cool, and then it's back to college for the fun of study again.  Apart from that, no real news. Debating whether travel insurance is a good thing or no, because there are better things I could spend 20 quid on. Maybe an annual thing through work could be worth the effort. Then at least I never have the cash in the first place!  Thanks for all your comment people, keep them up - they are what make me write this thing in the first place! I just wish I could think of some sort of structured way of saying things about me every time I post.....  Borrowing from someone else's site then!  listening: BTTB mix watching: nowt - no time reading: FHM and (shhh) accountancy magazine making: video cds of elecshow2000 and copies of stuff for emily annoyed by: the m6  That'll do!

      Ladies and gentlemen, I have only one thing to say.  Don't drink  urlLink Grolsch.  It is an evil drink and must be avoided in much the same way Stella should be.  That is, unless you want to wake up the next day with a horriffic hangover and feel like you want to die for the rest of the day. Yes, kids, that's exactly what I did on Friday and I'm only just recovering now. Ouch.  It was people's leaving dos - yes the great cull of 2002 is taking effect. Those who wanted to go went on Friday, those who don't want to go but are going to will do so next Friday. Thankfully we've got away without too much pain on that count, but still. Nowt really one can do about it I guess.....  So now I need to tidy up, do some washing and hoovering. Rock and roll, eh?

      OK, now I've got a new counter so I can see how many of youse lot are looking at these random wibblings.  (Wibble, there's a word that isn't used as much as it should be.)  Didn't get the chop (hurrah!) so life continues as normal. All good! Now I am pretending to do work - so with that I shall continue.  Might write more randomness later......

      Just one other thing to add today - Emily, can I just say that I love you deeply and truly from the bottom of my heart. I know it's crap but this is my equivalent of shouting it from the rooftops! I know I'm far from perfect but I just wanted you to know that I utterly, utterly love you!

      Can I just point out how annoyingly infectious the new Number One Single is - Nelly ft Kelly and "Dilemma". Its an R&B record, which of course I find it extremely difficult to like, but it's actually quite good!  Other good stuff in the (or about to)  urlLink chart  include(s):  DJ Sammy - Heaven (an old Bryan Adams track, if you don't believe me, look  urlLink here  Oasis - Little by little (a classic I think you'll agree - if you don't you're wrong) Big Bruvaz - Nu Flow (again, addictive) Manics Greatest Hits! Someone please buy me this? Badly Drawn Boy - You were right  and so on.  *Sigh* back to the study I suppose......

      Righteyho then. It's about 10pm, I've spent the evening in a meeting after college, then a pint or two, and now I'm home and have achieved nothing.  Unless you count a cable run up the side of my house an achievement!  Nothing of any substance to say, so I won't, but I will say that I can't wait for these exams to be over and I get a nice holiday and a relax. Yippee!

      God I hate case study. I'm sitting here reading very boring information about a very boring company. Ah well.  So I'm just going to do the "i'm..." thing now, and maybe more later? we'll see!  listening: Radio 1 and U2: Best of - 1980-1990 watching: Chris Moyles on five - believe it or not, funny! reading: the same book as before doing: Case Study :( annoyed by: Case Study, rain, the cable run i'm going to have to do amused by: the spagetti of cables behind my tv now that a Freeview box has joined the PS2, video, cable box......

      Oh, my dear Blog. How long has it been? Quite a while. Does anyone read these random musings I wonder? 230 of you idiots at the time of writing! Why? And who are you all?   Plenty of .co.uk's, a warwickpiazza.net, some assorted IP addresses and a btopenworld.com it seems. Quite a number in the past few days! Come back, dear readers, I will now be updating regularly(ish).  Actually, the most fascinating part about these webstats is the "referrer" bit, aka where you were last. Lots of you from  urlLink Mr Paul Gillibrand and Mr Dave Smith 's fine Blog, but more interesting are:  1) The Yahoo search for "BTTB Mix", which I must have mentioned once 2) The Google search for "fadefast you without me" - which is extremely flattering! An opera user no less!  A few from the homepage too, which is quite nice. The logs for  urlLink over there  are also highly entertaining, but I can't be bothered to go into them now. Who *are* TG4 anyway?  Well, what news have I? The exams, they are all over! Woo! So my life can get back to some semblence of normality from now on. Back to work tomorrow, after a well-earned week off!  We went to Geneva last weekend which was really *really* cool, it's such a lovely city, and with  urlLink easyJet  flying there for practically nothing it would be a sin not to go! The  urlLink photos  will be online shortly - well they are there now if you know how to find them ("geneva" will help) but I am clearly too lazy to update the menu page.  And so I've spent the last few days at home, generally relaxing and not getting up until 9 or 10, which is lush. Tomorrow is going to be a struggle!  Quite looking forward to getting back into work, although I fear I've forgotten everything I've ever known about auditing. This scares me somewhat. Ah well!   Also find out how much my pay rise is tomorrow. So if I'm in a foul mood tomorrow evening, you'll know it wasn't as good as I hoped :)  Righty-ho, I'm off. More postings more regularly from now on! (maybe)

      Right then, I'm back! Posting more regularly - ha.....  Well I'm just back from London where I attended  urlLink Mr Paul Hammond 's flatwarming party - during which he was very proud of his  urlLink .net  magazine article as part of the BBCi team. And rightly so!  I also heard a number of very interesting things this weekend, including some ******* about ***************. Can't possibly repeat what I've heard......  And then I went to  urlLink RaW  to enjoy the spectacle of Paul and Mark's "Arm Wrestling with Chas and Dave" show. Quality it certainly was!  So now I'm knackered - all ready for another fun week at work. Hopefully I'll be in the office all week this week, so that'll be nice. Hopefully anyway. At least it's a 4 day week!  Bye!

      Well hello there! Long time no Blog, so I thought I'd better come and fill this bugger in.  As you can see from earlier posts, I failed my case study exam. This is annoying because (1) I've gotta resit it, and I hoped I'd never see the cream-painted walls of ATC again (as pretty as they are!) (2) The resit course clashes nicely with my planned trip to the States, for Em's brother's wedding. This is particularly annoying cos I was really looking forward to it, and it was just another disappointment in a really disappointing weekend.  However, things are looking up now, cos I think I'll be able to get back early on Monday morning, and the course starts on Tuesday. Woohoo! If anyone has any bright ideas on combatting jetlag, or indeed on good places to get car hire or particularly nice airlines, email me at the  urlLink usual  address!  Other news. I'm working in Slough at the moment - yes, right on the Slough Trading Estate - and a lunchtime last week was spent looking for the Office building. Found it too - my colleague wants a photo right outside it, so expect them to be appearing on line some time when I remember to upload them! I still have a reel of film to upload from Christmas, which I will do when I get around to it. About two weeks ok?  In technology news, I now run a dual boot system with Win2000 and Mandrake Linux 9 - this is indeed being typed on Mozilla 1.1 under Linux. It's ok, however it's not doing what I wanted it to do, because: a) xmltv refuses to compile - or specifically a perl module it requires refuses to compile b) freevo keeps crashing, but I can work on that c) my G450 card does not output onto the TV head under linux without some nasty-looking poking of the kernel. Now, I believe that it *can* be done, I just don't understand how to do it. Any offers?  But if I can get all these things to work, then I'll have myself a nice little PVR - which will eventually run via infra red from downstairs. PS if you ever come to my house, just have a look behind the TV and have a laugh at the cable running upstairs to the bedroom - it's amazing what you can do with a pair of scissors, some gaffa tape and a 10m run of telephone extension lead......  But I don't think there's much else going on. At least, I can't think of anything! Have been spending a ludicrous amount of money on CDs recently - just bought:  blur - the best of eels - beautiful freak oasis - the masterplan lemon jelly - lost horizons david gray - new day at midnight  and for xmas I got:  u2 - best of 1990-2000 (despite it including songs from 2002....) coldplay - a rush of blood to the head  I'm working on putting my entire CD catalog online at some point, I have all the albums entered now, just the compilations to go, then my own compiled CDs - and I'm not 100% happy with the software I've got at the moment. (Songs-DB if you're interested!) Dave has given me some ideas - will have to look at them at some point.  Wow, what an incredibly long blog entry! Time to go and pack my bags now for another trip to sunny Slough....

      Ok, quick update for now.   1) Failed case study exam. Arse. Gotta retake in July. Arses. 2) Back to work now ready for the busiest of all busy seasons. Great. 3) Think I am still hungover from the New Year, spent in Ballyvoorney in Ireland, got very drunk. Cool! (And thanks Ems for being the best!) 4) I have (another) phone number, this time an Irish one: +353 86 168 0178  That'll do for now. Back soon!

      I came on here tonight with the intention of blogging something. However I realised that my life is not very interesting!   The only thing I've really done is fiddle with my computer a lot, fighting with myth to get it to work. Seems to be going quite well!  Can't quite get mythmusic to compile, but that can be worked on. Got more important things to be doing at the moment...   ...one of which is fighting with Orange. It appears that it is my handset now, so that's only 9 months old - there's gonna be war.....

      First of all, just want to say a big thanks to Dave and Simon for a lengthy IRC chat last night about setting up my computer in a non-broken way. Turns out that half the problems I am having could be due to some setting I enabled at install which appeared to put me into Fort Knox mode - changing my hosts.deny back to blocking out everything for example!  Seem to have broken it for good however during the procedure, so re-installing Mandrake is the way forward. Must remember not to be so paranoid about security settings next time!  In other news, I'm tired but now starting to catch up on sleep.  Orange are being foolish about the fact that a whole bunch of cells are down in Birmingham - so this means that I am finding it increasingly hard to make calls at home. Grrh!  And I'm on a diet. I am  absolutely starving  and I'd just like everyone to know that. I believe that I am supposed to feel better for doing this - however I can see me just getting grumpy because I'm hungry! Ah well, gotta be done I guess. Em and I are doing the same kinda thing, so that helps a lot!  Back to work...

      OK, had to add this one. In a moment of boredom, I was browsing the referrals page on Sitemeter for this very blog. Two particular Google searches caught my eye:   urlLink http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=arm+wrestling+with+chas+and+dave  - which I think is quite gratifying for the AWWCAD team!  But, more bizarrely:  urlLink http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=things+to+do+in+northampton+on+monday+17th+feb+2003&btnG=Google+Search  - yes, that's right - "things to do in northampton on monday 17th feb 2003"!  Would the person at 195.92.168.#, also known as E2-BRM-POP, or the Energis UK Birmingham POP network, please stand up?

      And again, thanks to the good and great Pauly G for pointing out  urlLink this  deconstruction of Avril Lavigne's lyrics for Sk8er Boi. Very funny... and I wonder how many random websearch hits this'll get me??

      Pauly pointed out on the phone the other day that I should have some sort of online shift sheet, much like  urlLink Dave's (*)  one. This is because I am all over the country and if anyone is in the local area, I could conceivably meet up with them for a drink.  Pauly was travelling to and from Reading whilst I was in Slough - so we missed each other by about half a mile every day!  So, as I am lazy and this blog is the only part of my site that seems to be updated at the moment, here we go:  W/C 10th Feb: Bromley W/C 17th Feb: Birmingham W/C 24th Feb: Birmingham MTW - Northampton ThF W/C 3rd Mar: Stafford MT - Newcastle WThF W/C 10th Mar: Nottingham W/C 17th Mar: Droitwich  But, as a warning to potential burglars - my housemate doesn't have away jobs so don't even think about it!  (to the tune of Day-oh!) #Hardman, Paul Hardman #Works 'round the country, so we're off to rob his house  Anyone remember that being used on  urlLink Simon Mayo 's Radio 1 show?  Don't think there's much else going on - working bloody hard at the moment.  Argh!!!

      OK, just a quick update.  Got  urlLink MythTV  going over the last week or so - thanks Dave! - and it's all good. Can now record stuff on computer and then watch it down in the lounge.... *grin*  Anyway, off to the Emerald Isle today. Hope we beat them in the rugby on Sunday! Heheheheh....  But now, time to do some work - I am working from home this morning! This is the life.....

      Mmmm, MythTV 0.8 released today. Guess what I'm going to be spending my evening doing!  Ems and I went to the  urlLink Glee Club on Saturday for their late show. Fantastic, three great comedians for only 11 quid. Bargain!  Also I'd like to heartily recommend  urlLink Henry's  Cantonese Restaurant for anyone wanting a really good Chinese in Birmingham. If only this mention would get me some sort of discount :-)  Hmm, right. Back at it!  (PS Congrats to someone who hasn't announced their Big News on their own website yet - you know who you are!)

      I just had to blog this.  A colleague and I were discussing the Mary Whitehouse Experience, and the original radio shows, as well as the TV shows - and of course regurgitating plenty of ages old gags along the lines of "History Today"!  But the most useful thing that we found was  urlLink tmwe.co.uk  which has an archive of some offthe Mary Whitehouse Experience radio episodes! Unfortunately they're in dodgy WMA files but I'm going to enjoy spending an afternoon listening to all 29 available episodes!  Oh hang on, that's nearly 15 hours. Maybe not all in one go then :)  There is also  urlLink this site  which has some real video clips, again that's today's lunchtime sport!

      Guess who's back? Yup, me I'm afraid.  Cant' be bothered to blog about computer changes and developments to the network, 'cos they are very boring and you'd all just turn off now.  So instead I'll think of something else to say.  The new F1 season has started apace, and the first race was actually pretty exciting! Good to see not a sign of the German w**ker on the podium ( you know who I mean ) and good to see Coulthard back on the winners list! I think the new qualifying setup will actually make the race a bit more interesting, 'cos one little slip in qualifying puts you somewhere at the back...  And in 6 Nations news, England thrashed Italy this afternoon. Good news for England. However, I'm slightly concerned that the weekend that England play Ireland I'm over in the Emerald Isle... d'oh!   The UK tour is now over for a little while, I think that I should be back at home for the next week or two. Hurrah!   Um, what else? 24 is very exciting at the moment, although I have banned myself from posting anything about the BBC3 episodes so that my friends (Pat!) don't shout at me. But it seems to be all good so far!  urlLink 24@BBCi  and  urlLink 24@Fox.com  will help you out if you so need it!  OK enough, now back to writing some exciting job review forms. Do you get the impression that I don't like the paperwork element of my job?

      Well, my spectacularly unupdated blog, how the devil are you? I just thought I'd come on here to see what mad fools had been looking recently, and I see a whole collection of hits! So thank you one and all.  So far, the Fadefast UK Tour has been going to plan, and as expected I'm in Geordie-land at the moment.  Working hard! As usual.....  But nothing of news to note really. Phone gone back to Ericsson (bah!), computer fine, work fine, relationships fine, so all good!  Meeting up with some old school chums in the not-too-distant future - you know who you are - so that'll be cool.  Also for some reason seriously considered  urlLink MP5  as a lifestyle decision... will be interested to know how many people click on that link and for what reasons!!!!  OK, back to PLCA reconciliations... Ciao for now.

      Advance warning:   HACK SHOW THIS SUNDAY 2-5PM   Yes kids, Mr  urlLink Pat Scullion  and I will be doing some radio this weekend, most likely to be 2-5pm on Sunday afternoon.  It's alll on  urlLink RaW  and you can listen live on the internet - so do that for it will be goodness.  If I think about it I'll do my best to find a chat client that you can use to talk to us in the studio - but pending that not working, comments on here please!

      Howdy Blog. How are you?  I'm at home at the moment, and the only internet connection I can get is a 26400bps link to Freeserve. Blimey, it's slow! Dialup on 56k in Brum is bad enough, but this is actually painful!  As far as my news goes, I don't really have much - off to the Emerald Isle tomorrow, which will be nice! A week off work - and by 10am on Monday I already felt guilty about leaving my team at it while I was relaxing in the garden! I need to switch off.....  I don't think I've made any sufficiently geeky purchases recently that are worth listing here... however plans are afoot to get the  urlLink Nokia  6100 when my 12 months expires in May.  However, because I'm on Everyday 50 and I really rather like it, I shall not be changing my number - for the first time in 5 years! Yes, impressive isn't it!  I really want a 3 phone, but I'm going to wait for at least a year until I see how it goes. Its all well and good being an adopter of new technology, but not when you want it on a budget! I have more important things to be spending my money on!  UK tour therefore recommences next week with a healthy stint in Nottingham. From whence I shall no doubt post more....  (BTW, as a reference - for good radio listen to  urlLink Red FM  on the ASX stream - its rather good! Quality is a biit rubbish, but definately listenable even over a dialup connection!)

      Drunk. Drunk is the way to be.   I thought I couldn't get more smashed than I was last night, then I went and surpoassed myself tonight with a wrecking session so large that i'm hungover already. Great :-S  But anyway. I miss you RaW guys. Does anyone have any plans to meet up in the great place that is Warwick? Russ, fancy visiting the Formule 1 hotel again? I really think a Top B session is in order. Or indeeed, any night when loads of people can make it. Click comments if you have any ideas.............  But I really think I should go to bed at this stage.  So I will. Goodninght.

      Well, in a fit of boredom, I've been doing some analysis of my personal webserver. Whenever I'm online, Apache is sitting plugging away at serving up a few webpages - a few of you out there know the address that its working on - and most of them are password protected, so random stumblers to this site, don't expect some easy way of hacking my computer!  Anyway, the analysis of codes returned looks like this:    200	39% 206	0% 301	1% 304	12% 400	3% 401	3% 403	3% 404	39% 405	1% 500	0% 501	1%    So 39% of my webserver's time is spent serving up 404 not found errors. Oh joy. Let's have a look at those 404's then....    GET /default.ida?XXX	75 GET /scripts/root.ex	28 GET /MSADC/root.exe?	25 GET /scripts/..%255c	23 GET /c/winnt/system3	21 GET /d/winnt/system3	21 GET /_vti_bin/..%255	17 GET /_mem_bin/..%255	15 GET /msadc/..%255c..	15 GET /scripts/..%c1%1	14 GET /scripts/..%c0%2	11 GET /scripts/..%c0%a	11    Brilliant! Viruses galore trying to get into my computer. Good job I'm not running MSIIS then.... Anyone know exactly which of the many webserver-attacking virii the above attacks relate to?  I was going to look at the source IP data but discovered that it doesn't really make a lot of sense - sometimes when I look at my own site from my own computer it goes via the external connection, so recording my own dial-up IP instead of 127.0.0.1. Ho hum.  So there you have it, sad spod fans!

      So the "activ8" stuff was an ad for AOL 8.0. Boooooooring!  Hopefully my workload should quieten down again very shortly, with an end to the job I've been on. Because of this, there's not much news at the moment from my end.  The US trip is creeping closer, so I've got to have a look for hostels and so on in the city. Ah well, thank god for the Internet!  My phone is screwed again, so apologies if you've tried to call me in the past couple of days. New one tomorrow or Monday!  Had a lovely email from someone working on the Henry's website yesterday, saying thanks for the review and asking what a blog was. That was nice! I will no doubt go and have a look to see how he came to the site.....  Big Brother has started again, and after my initial excitement, this year's housemates seem to be pretty boring. We'll see how they do.  OK, it's late and I'm going to bed. More soon.

      Well a couple of things to update you on.  I'm very  very  busy at work at the moment, so don't have a whole lot of time on my hands to write blogs, play with computers and suchlike.  However, a couple of things to mention.  1. Blueyonder is crap.  At least, their email service is being less reliable than a particularly unreliable thing, to which I have been unable to access my email for the last couple of days, and mails are getting lost somewhere. So I've transferred my main email account to fastmail.fm - the usual address will still work, but hopefully they'll go to fastmail rather than blueyonder - but if you've sent me any email in the last two days or so - resend it please?  2. I need to do some work on my mythtv setup.  Rumours of a 0.9 release abound, and most importantly my mplayer needs fixing so it doesn't segfault. But that's boring.  3. The new phone gets ever closer.  Definately going for the Nokia 6100 now.... I think!  4. Hack show was ace. Thanks to Cat and Pat for a great show!  5. Thanks to paulyg and Relly for creating the 2000-01 yearbook - I get a bigger entry than in 1999-2000 when I actually was somebody! Better late than never.....  6. Why does no-one comment any more?  7. This is just a place holder for...  8. Has anyone seen the adverts on the TV for something called "8"? It does the usual "communic8", "activ8", and finishes with someone drawing an 8 in the sand with a stick. WHAT?  That is all. A weekend of sleeping is about to commence......

      Wow. Well, I'm back, and surprisingly not too jetlagged.  I was greeted in London by a grey, wet, and miserable day, which is not what you really want to see when you're hot and sweaty and all you want to do is have a shower and go to bed.  But anyway, the holiday. Fan-bloody-tastic. I had the most amazing time ever. We did all the sights of New York and Chicago, and both Emily and I came to the conclusion that we love Chicago much more than New York.  Now that could have been influenced by a number of things; the weather was much nicer in Chicago (hotter and less humid), our hotel was fantastic and very close to the Magnificent Mile, so there was more opportunity for shopping - and shop we did, more of that later - and there was a lot less pressure to do everything.  You might not quite get what I mean, but what I'm trying to say is that when you're in NY you feel you need to do all the sights - Empire State, Ground Zero, Ellis Island, Statue of LIberty, Central Park, etc etc - whereas in Chicago as long as you go to Sears Tower you feel you've done your bit and can take it easy. Perhaps I've got it wrong, but that's how we both felt.  So, the shopping. I became somewhat of a label freak when in the States.  That's only because it was all so damn cheap! $25 got you a Tommy or Ralph Lauren polo shirt, which is all of about £16 - plus you've got to buy all the usual tourist stuff like I *heart* NY T-shirts and NY Yankees baseball caps.  Bought plenty of presents too!  So the wedding was the reason we went there and it was good.  It ought to have been - the rehearsal took long enough! Anna looked amazing, and so did all the bridesmaids, and I have to say that the groomsmen looked pretty dapper too.  Ems cried through pretty much the whole ceremony, which is perfectly ok - it's her brother after all!   I'll put the photos up just as soon as I can, I did manage to fill a 64Mb disc with snaps (that's over 300) so it'll take some time to sort through them. Plus, my folks want to see them, so I'll have to get them printed probably before I get them online. We'll see!  No doubt more as I think of it...

      Ok, right, we're in New York baby!  You might have spotted that i've removed the link to White House Hotel below. There's a very good reason for this: it's a dive.  The room was no bigger than my wardrobe, the beds were, well, dodgy, and the walls didn't actually meet the ceiling. It was like sleeping in a ..... i dunno, words don't quite describe it.  So, thankfully the staff there were kinda good and let us go without charging anything and recommended another hotel. Step in to the light,  urlLink SoHotel ! The room is nice but basic, its ensuite and it's only about $30 more than the other place. Phew!  Lots of exploring to do, so we're off to do it. Bye!

      Well well well. What a bonkers busy time at work I have been having. Thankfully as of right now (well, in 2 minutes anyway) it should all slow down when the accounts of my major client finally go to the presses.  Anyway, that means I can finally go on holiday. Woohoo! Off to New York, Chicago and Davenport with me, using the kind services of  urlLink British Airways ,  urlLink Airtran ,  urlLink Dollar Rent-a-car  and the kind hospitiality of White House Hotel edit: link removed, see above ,  urlLink Cass Hotel  and the lovely Anna and her folks.  So that's all good. But in the last five minutes I have suddenly been struck by the thought - what exactly should I be thinking about writing in this here blog about my holiday? Is it best to write about the experiences I have, the media I encounter (eg the US tv and radio networks, the NBC studio tour I'm hoping to go on), the services I use (like those fine companies above)? Where should my blog be situated?  And more to the point, who is still reading it now that IRC is in full force?  Then it struck me. Who cares? This collection of random musings is for me really, and the people who read it (I presume) care about me and what is going on in my life to at least some small degree. Or, alternatively, you stumble onto this site looking for songs by Spaced Ghost or Avril Lavigne's home phone number. (Damn, done it again!!!)   So I'm just going to muse about what I feel like at the time. Sorry if that disappoints you but that's just the way it is :)  Alternatively, you can  influence  the way that the whole thing works by clicking on that "Comments" word just over there.  Use it! I might even give you a mention.  That was deep and meaningful wasn't it? Screw it. MythTV 0.9 is  urlLink out .

But it's all good, I feel ready, I feel prepared, bring it on!  So that's my only news really. Apart from a few little things:  * I'm incredibly happy, thanks in no small part to a young lady of whom I have an aquaintance ;-) * Broadband is on its way.... 9th August! Woohoo! * This keyboard is really clunky for some reason * I'm going to buy a laptop! It's not for me though. * I'm hungry * I promise I'm going to blog more, and more often.

      Woohoo! Right then. Can I just say that broadband rocks? BROADBAND ROCKS! I take back all the bad things I have ever said about  urlLink Telewest ....... er, no, actually I don't. I like broadband though :)  In other news, I've now moved into the other room in my house.   It's a really nice room, and I've got lots of lovely new furniture and stuff.  Unfortunately I have to work tonight so I'll start that now... but I just wanted to say a few things:  * I'm still as happy as I ever was, even more so in fact * Happy Birthday Cat for either yesterday, today or tomorrow, depending on which time zone you're in! * Broadband means I can listen to so much radio and download so much stuff it's not even funny * MSBLAST.EXE is a pain in the ass (the blaster virus got in but couldn't get out!) * That's it I think!  I think i'll try and stuff some more updates in during this week as I think of it.

Coming up soon, will hopefully be the tale of the Great Ireland Adventure, to take place in the first weekend of October.  That should be a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to introducing some of my best friends to some of Ireland's finest attractions and hostelries.  What else has been going on? Work work and more work really! So instead of a proper update, 'cos I've got nothing to say, I'll let other people do it for me:    urlLink Falling Over Spaceships    urlLink An excellent review of Jump London    urlLink Anyone good at Scrabble?    urlLink The new REM song, Bad Day (excerpt from RemHQ.com)   That's what I've been reading today!

      Wow, well the fadefast world tour has taken a new international turn. I'm currently in Oslo on work, doing some licencee visits for a rather-well-known car rental company.  It's all good fun, and rather cold - we even had snow earlier today, to which everyone in the office was delighted; not because snow is fun but because snow means accidents which means more cars to rent out!  The  urlLink hotel  is lovely but this keyboard is very odd with å's and ø's and æ's and all the symbols in weird places.  But now we're off to the city centre to do some eating drinking and shopping! woohoo!

      Just a few little things... it has been brought to my attention that  urlLink RaW  has won the  urlLink Student Radio  Awards 2003! Good job, I say, and one of the greatest feelings in the world. I still remember blindly stumbling onto the stage and taking an award from Andy Parfitt....  Other things:  Apparently Alex Parks (the winner of Fame Academy) has also done a cover of Mad World. I haven't heard it but don't hold out much hope   Project Gotham Racing 2 is hard. Very hard. So I won't be buying it, I don't think.   Minor setback (see below) probably overcome.   That is all.

      Ah, I'm tired. I've decided that I don't like the darkness. That's very different to saying that I don't like  urlLink The Darkness  'cos I do.   I'm just fed up of getting up in the morning and going to work IN THE DARK and getting home IN THE DARK. And yes, I know that it's only November and there are many many months of darkness ahead.  Also, in this gap right here, I feel compelled to talk about a few things, and apologies if this sounds like  urlLink Pat 's blog, because I've just read it and it's no doubt influencing me!  We all trooped (well, I drove to London to meet the others) to see  urlLink Dave Gorman  at the Bloomsbury Theatre last Sunday.  It was GREAT. I can't tell you too much about the show, 'cos Dave basically made us promise (until we felt really guilty) that we wouldn't spoil the shows for other people. So go see it (find the dates on the website above) and laugh until you think that you might seriously have some sort of seizure.   And the other thing is a song, that is capturing the hearts and minds of a lot of people, and by the time it gets released *everyone* will love it. Seriously.  It's Michael Andrews feat. Gary Jules - Mad World  (Pat - not what you said!)  and it's great. It's really slow and sorrowful, and obviously it's a cover of a Tears for Fears song, but it's really really good.  Listen to it and imagine you're in your own little mad world.  It's coming out as a  urlLink single  soon, but for now you can get it on  urlLink NOW 56  or on the  urlLink Donnie Darko soundtrack . The original track is on the  urlLink Tears for Fears  Greatest Hits type thing.   Anything else? Erm... Slight disappointment today as far as the "top secret plan" goes, but it's only a small setback.  And it's not even a confirmed small setback either. Are you confused yet? 'Cos I am.  Oooh, yes.  I knew there was something else.  I got me an  urlLink XBOX ! Woohoo! It was a multipack thingy from  urlLink Game  in the  urlLink Bullring  and I am very pleased.  Next purchase for it is  urlLink Project Gotham Racing 2  and a second controller :)  Could I get any more hyperlinks in this post? Probably urlLink .

      Have you got a  urlLink Bluetooth  mobile phone?  Do you hang around at train stations, on buses or in places you might meet people?  Watch out - you might get  urlLink Bluejackq ed!   urlLink BBC News Online  alerted me to this new "craze" - will it take off I wonder....?

      Just a quick hello to anyone looking for the "badger and mushroom song" which is  urlLink here  or to people searching for the SoHotel in New York, which you can find more info about in the  urlLink archive , which should now be at the bottom of the page, until I figure out a clever way of doing it with a side bar!  These were the top two searches on this site!

      It appears that, to my annoyance, Gary Jules is slipping a small bit in the race to Christmas number one.  7-1 now! Very disappointing. We'd all better resign ourselves to the fact that we're not going to have a good Christmas no.1......  It's our work's Christmas Party tonight, and so I fully expect to be hung over like a dog tomorrow. Hopefully it'll be a good one, I'm looking for plenty of gossip and scandal and none of it involving me! Hurrah!   Very  disappointed at the news that  urlLink 24  won't be shown on the BBC. Hopefully  urlLink E4  will get it instead.  Incidentally, anyone who wants to try Linux (and see what all us geeks are so interested in) should have a look at  urlLink MandrakeMove  or  urlLink Knoppix  as these are both very good Live Linux setups - in other words, you pop the CD into your computer and boot it. It writes nothing to your hard drive at all, so it's totally safe.  Enough geek chat for today ;)

      All seems to be working now, so I will start on fadefast . co . uk properly!  Just to let you know, this blog is now located at  urlLink http://blog.fadefast.co.uk , so please update your bookmarks! (For now, the old link will still work, but I am probably going to move the blog over to  urlLink movabletype  at some point, and then it really will rest at the address above. Thanks.)  In other news, odds for the Christmas Number One (according to  urlLink bluesq.com ) put Pop Idol 12 in first place (1/2) followed by The Darkness (3/1) and Gary Jules (4/1). Now I don't mind too much if The Darkness make it to number one, but Pop Idol 12??? Nooooooooo!  Gary Jules for number one! I'll be buying it... will you? And if you don't, will your conscience ever forgive you?

      I am in the process of changing my hosting from a nice simple setup involving Easily and Freeserve into a really complicated one involving (in no particular order) Easily, ZoneEdit, 34SP, Fastmail and Blogspot. Oh, and probably Blueyonder.  This has had the unfortunate effect of jiggering my email, meaning that mail sent to my usual address maybe getting lost somewhere, or maybe in a big black hole just waiting to pop out when its all sorted itself out.  Whatever, just be aware that your email may not have landed at my computer just yet so I may be slow(er than usual) to respond.  Ta.    UPDATE 0900:   It appears that www . fadefast . co . uk is also broken, as the DNS A record from Easily has disappeared but the new one from ZoneEdit has not yet propagated. Mail to fadefast is definately disappearing as the MX has gone altogether. Fingers crossed that it all comes back up....    UPDATE 1600:   Mail is beginning to be delivered from various sources now, depending on your name server.

      Woo! My first proper update of the new year, yes, it's been that long since I have updated!   OK, lets do this week by week since Christmas.  Christmas and New Year were great, xmas spent at home and New Year spent in Ireland.  On New Year's Day we were at Emily's cousin's wedding, and the party was held at  urlLink the Summer Hill House Hotel  in County Wicklow. A thoroughly good time was had by all!  Since then, I've been in: Birmingham, London, Leeds, Cork, Chichester, Birmingham, Chichester, Oxford, Slough, Birmingham, Slough, Cork, Cambridge, Birmingham, Cambridge, and now back in Birmingham. Madness!  What else is there of note.  I am currently slumped on the sofa watching  urlLink Donnie Darko , which is turning out to be very weird but very good.  Ems and I are thinking of going on holiday for a couple of weeks in the summer, but it is proving very difficult to decide on a place to go! Any suggestions? Email me - iwantaholiday@fadefast.co.uk . Thanks. :-) So far the most talk has been about  urlLink Zakynthos  (or Zante depending on your travel agent) if that helps!  Technology news: I've just order a new 80Gb hard disk, and so will be taking the step of installing  urlLink Debian  as my OS of choice. I'm sure that this is not a particularly interesting statement, but it's a true one none the less ;)  Also, my new toy is a new mobile phone - the  urlLink Motorola  MPx200. It's actually very lovely, and allows me to do all sorts of things, including proper internet (albeit very slowly) and check email. It also synchronises with  urlLink Outlook  and does plenty of other things. Including MSN Messenger, which is the greatest part of it! Coming soon... a huge  urlLink Orange  phone bill!  So. Work is busy, Ems and I are happy, life is good.  I am still lonely due to my good friends being in London, my parents in Devon and my girlfriend in Cork, but hey.  I'm sure I could post some photos too, but I can't be arsed right now!  Web trawling of note:      urlLink Friendster , something to do with linkages between people. JOIN!    urlLink Monolithix.org , lots of good stuff for Smartphones    urlLink Modaco.com , more smart phone goodness   That's it for now I think.  Don't  urlLink forget   urlLink to   urlLink check   urlLink other   urlLink people's   urlLink blogs ....

      There have been lots of hits to this blog for my old, poor, eminem / kylie / techno remix by the name of "can't get you without me".  As  urlLink boomselection  doesn't appear to be hosting it any more, then I thought I would boost my own ego a small bit by putting it here for a limited time only.  Yes you too can own this piece of musical genius (?) by sending your favourite download manager  urlLink here  until I take it away!   EDIT: The original site is archived  urlLink here . Quite low down the chart at the end it seems - believe me when I say I was much much higher up at one time!

      My head HURTS.  I don't know why I have such a bad headache but I do.  Not really much to report currently.  Work is, well, work, and it's cracking on as ever.  Everything else is going well!  I've been looking at these various Friend-Of-A-Friend sites recently, and I think I'm registered on a few of them.  The one I'm most impressed with is  urlLink flickr.com  as it's got a really nice flash interface, and allows you to share photos with a group as well as just chat and create linkages between people.  So if you know me, I'm on there - come find and talk to me!  I'm not conviced about so much private information being made public by these sites, but hey ho, it's all good fun until someone loses an eye :)

      Not much to report at the moment re: April 1st post.  In fact, nothing at all to report.  Which sucks big time.  So in order not to get myself depressed about it, and by the fact that I'm sitting on the sofa on a Sunday evening doing stuff for work, I'm not exactly in the best frame of mind anyway, I'll type about some bobbins.  On April 1st, a  urlLink press release  was issued by Google saying that they were to launch an email service allowing each used 1Gb of storage.  I saw this and thought "Good April Fools guys, now get back to doing what you do best, being the best search engine on the web."  By the next day it was obvious that it was either the best April Fools gag in the world ever, or they were serious.  They were serious.  Over the forthcoming weeks it became apparent that there were some problems with the privacy problems surrounding GMail, but those aside, it seems that not exactly every one can get a gmail account.   I did.  And on initial look, it looks like EVERY OTHER webmail client out there.  Not that impressive.  Ok, yes, you can get 1Gb of mail, but what's that impressive? You can search your mail apparently, but I can do that already with my mail provider,  urlLink FastMail .    If you can convince me, do so in that there comments box.

      Hello blog trawlers, how are you today?  I know that I don't really post long posts on this thing, mostly 'cos I've got nothing much to really say.  My life isn't exactly that interesting, although I suppose it is somewhat different from the humdrum "Get up, go to work, go to bed, repeat until dead".  Mostly because you can slip "Get on a plane and go to Cork" roughly once every couple of weeks in there.  Now that's the bit that's really frustrating.  Every two weeks equates to not seeing your girlfriend for 11 out of 14 days, which, quite frankly, sucks.  As anyone who has been in a long distance relationship will tell you.  However this long distance relationship is a Really Long One, which I think makes it harder still.  Anyway.  Anyone who knows me will know that I love Em very much, and we've pretty much decided that we want to be together for ever and ever.  And it is because of this that I have been trying to apply for a secondment to Cork for bloomin ages.  I originally discussed the form with my performance manager in December 2003, and now it's April 2004 and nothing significant has happened to it whatsoever.    That's obviously incredibly frustrating.  It's been a case of "Oh, I've been trying to get in touch with the partner" and "We keep missing each other" and weeks and weeks of silence.  We are all hoping that something is going to happen on it very soon, but both Em and I are getting unbelievably annoyed over it.  I've even come close in the past weeks to chucking it all in and trying to find a job over there.  Particularly as I'm really disillusioned with work at the moment.  The most frustrating thing is  not being able to do anything  about it myself.  I am usually in control of most things in my life, and as this is the most important thing happening currently, I'm basically in the lap of the gods, or more precisely, in the lap of two well paid men who have a million and one more important things to do that sort out the future career and happiness of a lowly employee. NNnnnnneeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!  Hopefully someone will get back to me soon.  Hopefully.  If they come back with the wrong news, however, I will cry. I mean that.  I'm probably most scared about how I tell Em if it is bad news, 'cos I know she'll be heartbroken.  I'm praying every night that it'll work out OK for us, and that's not something I usually do.  All I want is to be happy.  Is that too much to ask?

      I've just got me a new phone, due to the Motorola I had before being rubbish! It crashed one too many times, so to Orange's credit they very quickly replaced it with a Nokia 6600.  Now obviously this has got me far too excited by the possibilities behind photo blogging and the like.  Particularly as the photos the camera takes aren't half bad!  So, a photo blog was necessary, and it's here:  urlLink http://photoblog.fadefast.co.uk  (which may not work if you are very quick off the mark...)

      Astute bloggers will have noticed that Blogger has changed, and in order to herald this, I have changed my template to something that is all new, quite blue, and apparently standards compliant.  Which will no doubt annoy  urlLink MarkT  because his lovely new bit of software to convert my blog to the Vobble IRC Channel will have been broken.  Ho hum :)

Please.  reading: FHM (the one with the big poster) and trying to read proper books, but never really having the time  doing: Work. All the bloody time. annoyed by: Work. See above.  amused by: Dunno really....

      I've now got myself a place in Cork, which is only about 5 minutes walk from work.  It's a lovely little flat, possibly slightly more money than I wanted to pay, but hey, I'm sure I'll work something out.  It's very modern, all wooden floors, things like that, and has all mod cons installed - including ADSL ready!   I think almost everything is ready now.  The ferries are booked for Fri 20th August (to come back to the UK with a van) and Sun 22nd August (to move everything over to Ireland, and take my car with me).  Its quite scary actually, packing all my stuff up for such a big move.  The attitude of my parents isn't really helping either, but I'm just going to have to knuckle down and get on with it.  I have to say that I'm really looking forward to it.  Obviously it's going to be a big change, and a big challenge work-wise, but I really can't wait.  And, the major bonus will be being able to pick up the phone and say "Hey, want to go to the cinema tonight?" not "Hey, want to go to the cinema a week next Friday?" :-)

      Most of you will probably know by now that I've been going out with Emily for the past two-and-a-half years, and during that time have spent a significant proportion of my life in airport departure lounges, on aeroplanes and in baggage reclaim halls.  The latter usually worrying whether my bags managed to make it onto the same plane as I did (which they have done on all but one occasion!)  If you hadn't twigged yet, Emily is Irish.  Believe me when I say that that is more than enough for one person, or indeed two people (when Ems does the return leg) in any amount of time. Plus, it is extremely frustrating only seeing your girlfriend for two-and-a-half days out of every 14.  Something had to change.  And it is finally changing!! After six months of waiting for my own firm to sort its act out and grant me a secondment, I finally gave up hope and started looking around.  And, as luck would have it, I've got myself a job, doing exactly what I do now, with the opposition, over in Cork!  So after an exceptionally stressful and annoying 6 months, I'm now facing into an incredibly stressful six weeks of packing up all my stuff, and moving to Ireland.  Fun fun fun! This blog will be updated with bits and pieces of information as I find it, do it or lose it, but at the moment we are looking at various flats in and around Cork!  My friends at the moment are:  * www.choices.ie * www.flatfinders.ie   * www.daft.ie
