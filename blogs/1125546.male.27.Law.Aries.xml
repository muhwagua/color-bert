      I was watching Sportscenter just now, which is a luxury of late. On a commercial break I happened to click through and find a documentary on National Public Television, which entailed a couple Brits being led around North Korea. A comment by the Brit was telling...I am paraphrasing, but it goes something like this, "Both Korean peoples long for reunification, and are blocked from it by the American military presence." Yes, of course, it is the American military presence, not the belligerant, violent, and, I think we can safely say, evil, North Korean regime that is the main holdup in Korean reunification. I guess while we're at it, he can blame us for Germany too. Heck, we had nuclear missiles stationed there.

      Maryland has shown that it maintains some sort of sanity in its electorate. Bob Ehrlich was  urlLink sworn in today . Ehrlich, a rather charismatic former Republican congressman was essentially forced to run for governor when the Democrat controlled statehouse wrote out a plan for his certain defeat when redrawing his eastern Maryland district in 2000. Talk about a mistake. Of course, Democrats as a rule haven't been known for their keen political judgment as of late, so I am not all that surprised.     When I lived in Northern Virginia I used to feel disconcerted going to Maryland, as it had a penchant for doing roadwork during business hours, and its state agencies were rather snobbish and difficult to deal with. Hopefully Governor Ehrlich can make some much-needed changes in the way Maryland operates. If it hopes to keep up with the growth in Virginia, he will have to.

      I've been convinced to apply for a JAG position in the Air Force. If anyone has any advice on the idea please feel free to email me. My intentions aren't set in stone yet, but it looks like working as a JAG would be a lot of fun.

      After an evening of quality time with the wife, and a little more studying, I decided it may not be a bad idea to do a late-night roundup.    It's not often you find a story on California GOP politics in a British paper, but the Independent has a quasi-rant (I'm honestly not sure exactly how to describe it..) on the chances of an  urlLink Arnold governorship .    Despite some the rather nonsubtle jabs at Schwarzenegger's past, the conclusion of the piece is on target. The California Republicans are in dire need of a candidate, and moreso, leadership. Bill Simon was not an ideal candidate last year, but neither was Grey Davis. Regardless, Simon was unable to seriously threaten Davis, primarily because of the lack of an effective GOP infrastructure in the state. Perhaps Arnold would create a rallying effect in the party, akin to Reagan, ,and energize it when the governorship becomes an open seat in 2006.      If you're interested in a more detailed assessment of the GOP situation in California, take a look at Shawn Steel's  urlLink article  on National Review Online.

      The next time Daschle complains about not being informed enough on foreign affairs issues, he has  urlLink no one to blame but himself . Is it possible that there are Democrats out there who view national security as just another political pawn,  who hope to capitalize on the inability of the United States Senate to make educated and well-reasoned judgments on the state of our nation? I hope not, but the available evidence is disconcerting.

      And the snow just will not stop...I know your average Bostonian will laugh at us (and we'll laugh at them, because they talk funny), but this kind of snow hasn't been seen around here in well over a decade. It is ale and fire weather, that's for certain.    I've yet to comment on the finding of the empty but chemical-ready  urlLink warheads in Iraq  for a reason - it's not news. There will be more such things found, and likely, worse things. Even Hans Blix appears to offer no explanation on this one.

      The baseball All Star game seems to no longer be a meaningless circus. The plan to give the league that wins the game  urlLink home field advantage  in the World Series is a big deal. Ever since  urlLink Pete Rose bowled over Ray Fosse  in the 1970 All Star Game the seriousness of the contest has been greatly diminished. This squeamishness to play the game hard was exemplified last year when it was called a tie as there were no more pitchers available on either side.     I wonder what happens if there is a tie now? Do you play 3 1/2 games at the AL park, and then 3 1/2 at the NL park? Pick up after 4 1/2 innings, and finish the game elsewhere? I don't think this was resolved in the vote.

      Britain sends the  urlLink pride of its fleet  to the Persian Gulf.  This story is one of the few where The Guardian lives up to its name...    Oh, and this is funny. It's been targeted by anti-war protesters. Now let's think about this for a second...it's one thing to go play Human Shield in Baghdad (a game, I hear, that is really not all that fun when the bombs start dropping), and another entirely to take on an AIRCRAFT CARRIER directly. It's easy to be noble when you know the target of your ire is too civilized to actually strike back. The ironies with which antiwar protesters must travel continue to amuse me. It's almost as if they can't shake them...

      As I and most others in Nashville are now officially snowed in, there's not much else to do but pontificate (that, and study for the bar...).  I flipped over to MSNBC a second go, and they were all excited about Kansas City getting its first snow of the year, a total of 4 inches. Meanwhile, we get 6 (I went outside and measured...it varies between 5 and 7 inches) and don't even get an honorable mention! Not to get too excited over a minor issue, but such an example is just emblematic of the poor reporting at MSNBC. If you don't understand that more snow in the South is a bigger story than less snow in the northern Great Plains, you might have a problem with journalistic judgment.

      Where is the Left on North Korea? For an ideological bent that claims in their collective loudest voice to care about people's rights, who will go to the edges of the Earth to support abortion, and who will send out thousands of attorneys in an election to make sure minorities do not feel the least uncomfortable at the polls, they are silent...almost stone silent, about the  urlLink atrocities of Kim Jong Il .  I often come to internal loggerheads about such things. There's a part of Realpolitik in me that says we should contain, contain, and contain until we cannot contain any more. Then there's the other more Wilsonian part of me that says that all tyrants should be deposed, and left to their fate at the hands of those they oppressed.   We have two Stalinists dictators in the crosshairs right now. Millions have died at their hands. Yet, the whole "War is Not the Answer" crowd (led by the expert generalship of none other than Sheryl Crow) finds some sort of emotional satisfaction at making sure that any efforts to free these people are thwarted. The people who live under dictators lack one primary, and decisive thing that we take for granted, and that's the vote. A prerequisite for the vote is freedom. Once they have the vote, they deserve the leader they get. Regardless, when people vote, they don't knowingly vote for butchers.  But no serious person believes that Saddam Hussein actually got 100% of the vote. Neither did Castro, or any other "president" or "premier" in a totalitarian society.   The antiwar left often asks why the people don't just change their leader, or why we don't just helicopter in to Baghdad and arrest Saddam.  This, sadly, is a testament to their lost grasp on reality. When a perspective loses its grasp on reality, it no longer deserves consideration. It only deserves contempt.  If the freedom of those who are oppressed daily, tortured, and killed for no more than having the  wrong opinion , among other things, is not worth a war, then nothing is. The United States is a country who liberates, not conquers. If we were conquerors, our colonies in Europe and Asia would be the first to tell you (note for any antiwar readers, we have colonies in neither Europe nor Asia).

      It's  urlLink about time ...Why we haven't been keeping a closer eye on visitors from EVERY Muslim country is beyond me. We can fool ourselves all we want, and attempt to be a tolerant society to a fault, but the problem is the Islamists (note, I did not say Islam). Any interpretation of the Koran that requires destroying infidels and making the entire world Muslim is suspect. Any country where there is a significant adherence to such an interpretation ought to have its nationals watched. And that's all we're saying...watched. It's not as if we are putting a scarlet Q on their vest, or making them wear some hideous sounding cow bell.  We heard a similar mantra to that coming out of Islamist teaching from the Soviets during the Cold War. Krushchev promised us our children would all be living under communism. And he actually meant it. He lost, along with his system, but thanks in large part to visionary American and British leadership in the 1980s, after significant Soviet world gains in the 1970s. Societies ignore at their own peril what their enemies tell them their intentions are. The Soviets did it, the Nazis did it during the 1930s, and the Vandals weren't too shy about it either, if you want to go way back. It's a cliche, but if one does not study history, one is doomed to repeat it. Repeating such history in the age of WMD is suicidal folly.

      For those of you not in Tennessee, you can skip this next post. If you have any interest in the politics of the Volunteer State, please feel free to proceed.  Finally, the Tennessee legislature is making at least a token effort to live within its means. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor when Speaker Jimmie Naifeh made the following acute observation, ''We are going to have to try to work within the current revenue structure. We have to try to do this without raising any new revenue.'' See it  urlLink here  in The Tennessean.  For those of you not in Tennessee, this is the equivalent of Bill Clinton swearing off women. After the battle of attrition waged during last year's legislative session, this turnabout, worth whatever Naifeh's word is worth, is nominally quite the development.  The Republicans did well to pick up the seats they did. Unfortunately, the General Assembly is still a Democratic institution, where they maintain a soft ten vote majority. I say soft because there is a healthy group of Democrats who remained true to their word to oppose the income tax, and who were reelected on that basis. And that is a good thing. Despite the words of the good speaker, we all know that the income tax will never be dead. It's a battle that will have to be fought every session. This will especially be true as the issue of equalizing teacher pay across the state per court order is brought into effect. Expect the Democrats to connect the income tax to education. Better yet, count on the TEA forcing the Democrats to connect the income tax to education.  Point being, the boys over at Tennessee Tax Revolt better be gassing up the trucks.

      I have to give Tony Blair a lot of credit. He has stepped up to the plate on the War on Terrorism and taken some fastballs in the face. Unfortunately, in politics, you never get to take first.

      Now that the formalities of blog creation and purpose are out of the way, I can continue on to more engaging, and at times entertaining, topics. For instance, the rather insane woman organizer of the Naked Liberal Woman Message to Space for Peace (I don't think that's the official name, but it ought to be) is on Hannity & Colmes right now. Talk about wacky. I suppose there's something to be said for someone's persuasive ability when they can get 100 women to take off their clothes and lie in the grass spelling things, but it doesn't say much more than that if that person is actually trying to affect public opinion. Geez - her stated position is that "America should disarm." What are we supposed to do with that?

Perhaps there is some value to getting the Franco-German alliance on board, but I can't see it.

      It appears the rewriting of history to besmeach Reagan  urlLink has already begun.  The author is disingenuous at best. His contention is that Reagan was no conservative, as the federal government expanded on his watch. Of course the federal government still expanded on his watch...he became president when there were only 165 (approximately) Republicans in the House of Representatives! Democrats like to spend money...it's an established and proven fact, close in its indisputable truth to the law of gravity. Perhaps an argument could be made that Reagan should have pushed harder, effectively shutting down the federal government, but that would have also thwarted his goal of increasing defense spending to push back the expansion of the Soviet Empire.    The article is written as if Ronald Reagan were not president, but dictator. Politics is a vocation of compromise. Unfortunately, that means many good ideas are watered down. The alternative is worse.  Additionally, the attack that Reagan "went soft" on the Soviets is ill conceived. Once the Soviet Union was forced to bargain from a position of weakness, Reagan was willing to bargain. Remember Reykjavik - he left at the suggestion that SDI be abandoned. He got up, and left. I don't think this is an action of someone "soft" on the Soviets. And that was in 1986, when the author claims such softness was rampant.    Remedial history? Not at all. Misinformation? Absolutely.

      France is a favorite topic of mine. No country has quite had the immense swings in importance and mood as have the French. Since the Gauls fell to the conquests of Caesar the region's history has been one maddening roller coaster ride, peaking, I suppose, with the rise of Napoleon. That was nearly two hundred years ago.  urlLink Nowadays  things are different. Apparently, the French can't even tame the Ivory Coast. Now comes the obvious question.    If the French can't keep the peace in the Ivory Coast, a small nation on the west African coast, and former colony...well, it's obvious what this leads to. What is their opinion on the current international climate worth? Iraq isn't China, but it's certainly more than the Ivory Coast. Why should we heed the advice of a country that, for lack of a desire to find a nicer way to put it, is a complete failure in its international relations? France, as it is situated, has no useful role to play in the world. It is an annoyance, and should be treated as such. The policies of the government are inexcusable and dangerous to the world.     You want to influence events, you want to make the world a better place? Get off your hands and build a military, dismantle that monstrosity called a welfare state, and step up to the plate. Until you earn being listened to you, I hope the leaders of our country ignore you and treat you for what you are - an international has-been and an apologist for ruthless dictators.

      I must believe  urlLink this  to be one of the most disjointed articles I have ever read. Of course, Maureen Dowd is not someone I often agree with, but my main beefs with her this time are almost soley organizational. There is an overtone of a theme, however, and that appears to be that no matter what, Bush is wrong. Bush could have proposed minimum welfare benefits of $100,000.00 per year last night, claimed that we have been wrong all along, and should cede Alaska to Iraq for its trouble, and have resigned on the condition that Al Gore be instated as president, and Dowd would not have been happy, claiming with her unparalleled automation something about how the oil companies made him do it.    Sheesh, you hate to do it, but I guess some people are better written off. Working for the New York Times seems to be like working for the INS - no matter how incompetent you are, and no matter how much you get worse, you're never relieved of your duties.

      The speech was magnificent. Not quite as good as the 9/20 speech, but then again, not much could be. My take is that Bush has neutralized the Democrats on the domestic front, and has raised the curtain on our intelligence on Iraq's capabilities, revealing the tip of a WMD iceberg. Powell will drain the tank to show how big that iceberg is on 2/5.    Bush was very impassioned, throughout the speech, but especially regarding the War. He is a war time president, and thankfully, knows it. I don't mean to dwell, but I'm not sure his predecessor could convey what Bush conveyed tonight. The speech was little on style, as far as soaring oratory goes, and large on substance. Of course, I would argue that Bush has a style, and that style is plain communication. It's not Clinton,  where it sounds good but you can't remember a thing he said once it's over, and it's not Reagan, where you believed him because he communicated effectively with large ideas, but instead it's simpler. Bush has a delivery that is no-nonsense, and straightforward. And it's effective because you know he is in fact honest. Clinton had to spice it up, and appear more glib, precisely because he was fighting an assumption he had created that he was not to be trusted. Reagan was simply well-trained in communicative skills. His delivery was professional and he had ideas to convey.    The domestic part of the address was needed, and well done. I am glad he stuck with conservative themes regarding the budget and taxes. The AIDS initiative was surprising. I didn't expect it, but it is in our interest. Africa at some time or another must join the world in this century, and that plague of a disease makes doing so extraordinarily difficult. Democracy can grow everywhere, but cannot take root when death is more of a certainty than order. In many places in Africa, that is the case, both from conflict and disease. We can address the latter more efficiently at present than the former, and I agree we ought to do so. If Japan, which is basically an island of rock, with minimal natural resources, can become a first rate world economy, there's no reason most of Africa cannot do the same given a good chance.

      Today is the day to ponder the content and style of the State of the Union, slated for delivery tomorrow night. Especially in light of the delivery of Hans Blix's report today. Actually, I doubt very much that the report affected Bush's speech at all. Bush does not need the UN to tell him something that our intelligence already knows. What he's waiting for I don't know. Perhaps it is a sufficient military build-up (a la the Powell Doctrine, or, more accurately, the Eisenhower Doctrine). I certainly hope he's not waiting on France and Germany. But anyway, back to the speech itself.    Bush needs to convey three things tomorrow night: first, he must establish indisputable resolve regarding Iraq, second, he must convey a sense of urgency to the War on Terror and Iraq in particular, and third, he must make an impassioned case for his tax cuts.  Actually, I think he ought to lead with the tax cuts. Not because it's more important, but because by demonstrating he is aware of domestic issues, he neutralizes the Democrats attacks on the domestic front. Above all, he must show leadership. Leadership is what all people want, and specifically what the American electorate looks for in a president.  Bush has the bully pulpit of bully pulpits tomorrow night to show he has a vision, understands the situation, and intends to act. Polls showed in the 1980s that though Americans may not have always agreed with Reagan, they trusted him, and respected his convictions. Consequently, he enjoyed one of the most lopsided reelection victories in history. Bush knows this. He knows he must emulate Reagan, not his father. This knowledge, and his obvious political acumen, will ensure a great speech tomorrow night.

      I guess I lied about posting more frequently. So it goes...I actually had what I thought was a rather good post earlier, but my computer decided to blink out on me right before I published it.    I perused a variety of news sources on the web this morning and noticed a plethora of anti-war pieces. The usual suspects were present: the Washington Post, MSNBC.com, etc. What was most appalling was the apparent lack of fact checking. Apparently, France and Germany alone make up "most of Europe," to quote a paraphrase.  Authors and editors alike appear to be unaware of Spain, Italy, the UK, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary. It's no surprise that many of the countries who have committed to assisting the United States with Iraq are from Eastern Europe. The memories of dictatorial regimes are fresh in the collective Eastern European conscience, and their foreign policies reflect it. Surprisingly, France and Germany have a much shorter memory.    My theory regarding the Franco-German alliance is as follows. France and Germany are simply resentful of their self-imposed irrelevance. Neither country can defend itself, much less assist in a war in the Middle East. Being impotent on the international stage is hard for two counties who have spent a good portion of their history influencing world events, often times at the tip of the sword.  The proud fall hard, and what we are seeing is two former world powers operating on the fringes of world events. They do not want to follow the United States, which is why their rhetoric is so vitrolic toward the US. However, they are unable to lead on their own, though they claim to be staking out the high moral ground. War is certainly a horrible thing - but we must not forget the death of thousands, or millions, at the hands of a smuggled WMD, is worse.  That is what we are facing with Iraq, and after Iraq, North Korea.    I must make it clear I am no advocate of war for the sake of war. No one is that insane. However, avoiding a short term unpleasantry without looking at the long term picture is foolish. This is precisely what the Old Europe contingent is doing (courtesies of course to Sec. Rumsfeld). And they do it at the eventual expense of their own people, which is contemptible.

      It appears there's more seriousness to the Korean Krisis than previously thought.  urlLink A carrier group and long range bomber  support is nothing to sneeze at. Four are being sent to the Persian Gulf, and for Iraq, that is likely overkill. Bush isn't going to back down with North Korea, methinks.

They know better - I have no idea why those opposing this stage in the greater War on Terror do not seek counsel from those who have lived close and in person through not only the Cold War, but also World War II. I suppose it's an ignorance of history, or more accurately, a thorough knowledge of revisionist history. The gentleman quoted is right - you can't negotiate with madmen. You can only negotiate with democracies - henceforth, let's make all dictatorships democracies, one cockroach at a time...

      At least  urlLink here  we have a protester who truly understands that protests are  impotent when affecting world events. The comments at the bottom of the article are interesting, though I wouldn't go so far as say they are enlightening. Complaints about the Left being silenced here are bogus. Just because no one is listening to you does not mean you are silenced. The nuts who preach from street corners in New York are not silenced - they are just ignored.  The same goes for those opposing war because it is "bad," or who advocate that we should bomb Texas because it has oil, or those who have concocted assinine conspiracy theories about the Trilateral Commission joining with the Illuminati to control the world, with Bush as the frontman.     Believe me, a true proponent of freedom, liberty and capitalism for all peoples of the world - we  hear  you, it's just that we have chosen not to listen because you have nothing of value to say.

      Here's a letter I submitted to the  The Tennessean  today:       To the Editor:    I began reflecting a little after reading reports and watching coverage of the worldwide war protests this weekend. I do believe that the protesters in each European capital this weekend outnumber each respective country's military personnel.  Doubly, this also tells you something about the priorities of many of Europe's denizens. It reminds me of an old joke, of which many variations exist, where someone works harder in an effort to avoid work than they would if they actually just worked. If the same numbers of people protesting this weekend actually funneled their energies in a constructive direction, there wouldn't be a despot on the planet who was safe. As it is, despots cheer, and the empty slogans march triumphantly, pointlessly in an unwilling charade supporting the worst mankind has to offer. And they offer no better way, nor appear to realize they are obligated to offer an alternative, if they are to protest with any credibility, which is sad.  To turn about a oft seen slogan, surrender is never the solution.     The children of Europe play amongst themselves in a dangerously delusional fantasy land.  It is sometimes forgotten that we broke away from them.  We are from Europe, but we have long ago ceased to be of Europe. This is an important distinction to be made and remembered. History has proven, repeatedly, that we in the United States tend to know better. Europe, repeatedly, has shown itself to be the opposite, and ultimately ends up relying on us when situations deteriorate, from World War I and II, to the Cold War, to the Balkans.  Once again, we know better.  Freedom and security is preserved by the visionary and the brave, not the hesitant and the weak.  For over two hundred years, the United States has been the former. With all respect due Margaret Thatcher, this is no time to go wobbly.    Nathan Moore Nathan@moorestore.biz

      And  urlLink THIS  is classic. Somehow this protester hasn't changed my mind about the necessity of the liberation of Iraq, as well as the rest of the Middle East. But then again, when has a protester changed  anyone's  mind? Everyone has the right to freedom of speech. They can speak all day long, and some do. But quantity does not make quality, a maxim that is gaining more credence the more we see these protesters take to the streets. Slogans are not policy, and what these people allege to be protesting against is policy. At least give us something to talk about...at least a reasonable chance to debate some comprehensible argument...but if the most you can muster at a protest is a few tens of thousands in a nation of 280 million+  (citing the last protests in DC, NYC and SF) you are wasting your time. They'd be more effective not protesting at all.

      I too am quite disappointed with the current conduct of select diplomats and nations in the UN. However, I think the situation is not as bleak as  urlLink Mike Silverman  makes it out to be. True, "Old Europe" and those other countries who want to maintain a ready supply of cheese and w(h)ine are avoiding the lessons of history like the black death. And again, as history repeats itself, it is Britain who stands ready to defend a continent she has had a long but strained relationship with. But the positive common factor between the days of Nazi appeasement and today is that the United States stands ready to bail Old Europe out of their collective shortsightedness.     I believe in Bush's resolve. His core values are deeply rooted, and unlike his predecessor, takes the presidency seriously. He will not allow the United States to risk its very existence as the preeminent world power and mankind's last, best hope, to placate a handful of cowardly diplomats from second-rate countries seeking to enjoin the United States from acting for no other reason than to remedy their own bitterness at a pathetic and self-inflicted irrelevance.     Perhaps we ought to form a new international organization. The permanent members would include the United States, the UK, Israel, Australia and the former Eastern Bloc, none with veto power but the first four. Membership in the organization past the permanent members will be based on each country's adherence to and history of supporting democratic principles. I advocate the formation of an organization for the good countries of the world.  The organization will act both as a political force and a free trade zone. Only those countries that are ruled by their citizens will be welcomed into the fold. Those who apologize for dictators who happen to occupy their former colonial lands will not be tolerated. Thugocracies will not be tolerated (Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, China, North Korea, Venezuela, Libya, Cuba, etc.). Expulsion will be by a 2/3 vote.     I know my visionary and new UN will never exist.  It's a nice thought, though. However, a NAFTA that includes the UK is not an improbable possibility...

      This is a  urlLink fair point ...online polls are notoriously unreliable. They are as scientific as choosing what sports team you're going to root for based on your favorite animal. However, I must take contention with Mr. Volokh on one not being able to pick just one right out of the poll that would be most important to freedom and democracy.    Despite the unscientific nature of the poll, I believe its results are correct. The 2nd Amendment was not inserted in the federal Constitution to ensure hunting rights, but to ensure the people the right to rebel against an oppressive government. Assumedly, once one possesses the ability to rebel against an oppressive government, the other rights would fall into place in a sort of libertarian way. Interestingly, the Tennessee Constitution explicitly places more emphasis on the right to bear arms than the 2nd Amendment in its Declaration of Rights, going so far as authorizing the possession of military arms in case the People must rebel.     Of course, nowadays, neither I nor my Southern brethren would stand a chance with our hunting rifles and the like against a tyrant government commanding the power of a modern military, so this point is useful in theory only. With the noise activists on the Left are making, you'd think we'd need to rearm with military wares, seeing as John Ashcroft and his thugs have already knocked my door down three times this week and Tom Ridge won't stop tapping my phone lines.    Oh, wait, those people are the same ones who favor gun control / confiscation...so I guess if we really did have an oppresive government they would stand up and, well, protest some more?

      The sheriff of Milwaukee is truly a  urlLink man to be admired . Everyone is familiar with RINOs, but he appears to be a bona fide DINO (Democrat In Name Only). Calling out the race-baiting left is something everyone should be willing to do, and appears to be a strategy the national GOP leadership is becoming comfortable with.  Orrin Hatch's vociferous denunciation of the Democratic filibuster over the Miguel Estrada nomination was amazing to watch on Wednesday night (I do spend my nonstudying time watching C-Span 2 - go ahead, laugh). It's about time. I'm sick of being labeled as a racist because of simply having common expectations for all people, regardless of race.   The true proponents of equality before the law are not in the black leadership today. They certainly are not in the Democratic Party. There is not one heir to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s legacy today among the left-anchored so-called black leadership, from Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the Congressional Black Caucus.  The true proponents of freedom, and judging those by the content of their character, are Republicans. The Party of Lincoln daily fights for the timeless truths stated by the Founding Fathers. Equal Protection, the First Amendment, Due Process....not a one a real concern of  the Left (unless, of course, you agree with them). When was the last time a conservative yelled they were being censored simply because they were being disagreed with? Or that equal protection demanded  any  sort of preferential treatment? The leadership of the Democrats today fights only for retention of power, the Constitution be damned. It is a sad state of affairs for a party with many distinguished statesmen in their history.

       urlLink Old news is old news . So Mr. Blix is to report yet again that Hussein is violating the will of the U.N.  In court the judge would have stopped the prosecution from piling on the evidence. Saddam Hussein is a bona fide liar, mass murderer, and Stalinist tyrant. He has made his own case for his demise. I trust Bush, but I am not sure what we are now waiting for. Germany and France can either come around or not, the world doesn't really need them. An alliance is set. Between us, the Brits, and the Aussies, not to mention all of Eastern Europe and most of the former Soviet republics (save, of course Russia itself), there is little chance this war will last as long as the 1991 intervention. Additionally, there is no longer any water in the "rush to war" argument, so frequently set forth as gospel by Reuters and the New York Times. If we were rushing any slower Hussein will most likely die from rheumatoid arthritis rather than US intervention.

      This  urlLink article  by John Fund from OpinionJournal.com compliments my argument a couple days ago about the downsides of diversity. It truly is a zero sum game - if pursued as a policy, more diversity equals less qualification. If diversity occurs by accident, not design, so be it.  But diversity by design necessarily waters down academic requirements. The only time this is not the case is when there are two prospective students, both equally qualified from different races. The fair resolution of this type of quandry would still be random selection. The difference between proponents and opponents of affirmative action lie in the results desired. For example, the fact that one student is black, and lower to middle class, and the other is white, and lower to middle class, if both are equally academically qualified, should make the decision between the two fungible. Proponents of affirmative action tip the scale. Opponents say flip a coin. It's better to take the fair route, in my opinion, than to give value to a fundamentally flawed standard. The only kind of diversity that should matter in an academic setting is viewpoint diversity, as this is requires an emphasis on thought and choice, instead of uncontrollable outward characteristics. But one doesn't see institutions of higher learning scouring student applications for membership in the Federalist Society, or the ACLU, or to see whether or not the person worked on a political campaign.      Our system of higher education as it now stands isn't looking forward - it appears to be looking sideways. I would think that those serious about the quest for truth would want the most qualified and best trained individuals marching forward with them, regardless of race.  The unfortunate but correct conclusion seems to be that there are few academics out there serious about their quest.

      It's an easy prediction,  but I'm going to make it anyway. The moment there is confirmation that Saddam Hussein is dead, or else gone from Iraq, we will no longer see isolated comments and interviews from freed Iraqis, speaking well of democracy  urlLink "Whiskey. And sexy" , but with bated breath - we will instead see a grateful people rise up to thank us, and Britain, for ending one of the most oppresive regimes in the history of man.  What we do with that gratitude is important. Iraqi self-rule, in my mind, goes without saying.    The occupations of Germany and Japan after World War II were four and seven years, respectively. Neither country had a history of democratic traditions. The Weimar Republic was a complete failure, primarily because of the oppressive terms of the Treaty of Versaille. Japan, on the other hand, was starting from zero. History has proven that democracy can exist in nations previously lacking what many consider the necessary experience.  Japan was certainly a much harder case than Iraq will be. The Japanese culture was and is still very collectivist in its thinking. Shintoism, the source of the emperor worship that largely led to the bloodiest and most intense fighting of the Pacific Theater, had to be outlawed by our occupying forces to make way for the secular and democratic state of Japan that now exists. Essentially, the occupying forces had to dismember a personality cult and forbid a religion, while at the same time educating a populace about the operations of democracy who was completely unfamiliar with the theories of individual rights inherent in, and necessary for, democratic functions.    The job in Iraq is much easier. The personality cult is not followed voluntarily by the population, but is instead imposed by a despised dictator. Already the people are in a mindset conducive to governmental change. At this point, any form of government that may take shape in postwar Iraq is preferable to the regime that now exists under Saddam and his sons. There is no sociological collectivism to break down,  and no religion in need of destruction.  The Islamists currently inhabiting the northern part of Iraq are at this time being picked off and destroyed by the 173rd and allied Kurdish forces. That leaves Sunnis, Shiites and Christians remaining in the population, none of which appear to have terrorist tendencies. The Kurds in the north tend to be Sunnis, a sect of Islam that is among the most liberal in the Middle East. In postwar Iraq, the Kurdish element will be vital to a properly functioning Iraqi democracy.     It is to the benefit of the civilized world to maintain the territorial integrity of modern Iraq. Talks of a separate state of Kurdistan would be disasterous on two levels. First, the existence of an independent Kurdish state would do much to destabalize eastern Turkey. Turkey already has a moderate problem with Kurdish terrorism within its borders. Reinforcing the militant Kurds in Turkey with an ethnically familiar state next door would simply add to those problems.  Second, the Kurds would be an important moderating factor in a national Iraqi government.  This is not to say the Shiites will start terrorist camps without a Kurdish counterbalance in national Iraqi politics, but such an influence would definitely be useful in deterring  Islamist factions in Saudi Arabia from causing trouble in southern Iraq, where the Shiites may not strongly oppose their presence. Third, a wholly maintained Iraqi state would tie together the two problems mentioned above. If the Kurds in northern Iraq are focused on their own country they will be less likely to direct their attentions to the rebellious Kurdish contingent in eastern Turkey. Some resources will be expended to assist their brethren in Turkey, but not nearly as much as would be the case if an independent state of Kurdistan was formed.  Because of these ethnic considerations, a separate state of Kurdistan would be less motivated to interact and keep tabs on the separate Iraqi state to the south.     Additionally, geopolitics and internal stability would be more complicated for the Kurds if a separate Kurdistan was formed. The oil produced by Iraq leaves Iraq by the Persian Gulf. If Iraq was divided into two states, the Kurds would have to negotiate pipeline rights to get their oil reserves out of the country. This sounds like a small consideration, but would lead to massive amounts of economic waste and security concerns for a newly formed state. Relying on Turkey is a nonstarter, and putting trust in Syria is inadvisable. This is not to say neither could be done, but it puts the Kurds in a precarious position regarding their chief economic asset. Defense costs to secure it would cut heavily into what ever profits could be realized.     The form of the democracy is another question for another day. I've been taking notes, and will hopefully have something up in another day or two on the subject.

      My alma mater, which used to be a relatively conservative bastion in the midst of a generally liberal academia,  urlLink continues to drift wholly left .  Strict scrutiny is quite the heavy standard to be deemed satisfied.  First, diversity in higher education must be deemed a compelling government interest. I believe the argument ought to end there.  SCOTUS will likely find diversity to be a compelling interest, however. The meat of the decision will likely fall into the means of achieving racial diversity.     The degrees of grey are many. And as this article correctly states, the means will likely be debated intensely in the Court. However, allowing the Michigan way of doing things to continue is horrible. Let race be a factor, sure, but not at the expense of academic qualification. Perhaps admission floors should be set, where no individual, regardless of their melanin content, would be admitted. The argument made by Dean Syverud at Vanderbilt Law School has some merit, but unqualified minorities by definition are unlikely to offer worthwhile opinions in an academic setting. I don't care what your race is, you ought not be in law school if you had an LSAT score of 140 (to make an absurd point). But in its entirety, I believe the Dean is more wrong than right. Law school does not exist to provide sensitivity training to handle minority clients. Law school exists to train one to think logically, to think creatively, and ultimately, to think like a lawyer. And as many attorneys who have been in the craft for a long time have told me, that process does not end after three years of law school. The foundation is simply laid in the first three years, while the building process ought to continue to the end.     So while arguments are being made to validate the Michigan method, the real question to ask is whether the Michigan policy advances the purposes of a legal education. That debate is obviously sidetracked by the constitutional considerations, but even if SCOTUS finds for Michigan in some way, the question as to whether the method is intelligent has not been answered. Just because something is deemed permissible does not make it advisable, to borrow a trite but accurate phrase. So far, no arguments have convinced me that race is a valued substitute for intelligence. Law school is an interactive learning process, and regardless of race, my education was not enhanced by people speaking in class who had no grasp on the topic at hand. If there is a problem with listening skills, as Dean Syverud noted in the article with students at VUSL, perhaps there are other ways to address that.     The ultimate conclusion, as all roads in this argument lead to, is that only qualified individuals ought to be admitted to institutions of higher education.

FYI, for those who don't know, Columbia, the county seat of Maury County, which is two counties south of Nashville, holds an annual Mule Day celebration. Mules are a way of life there. Y'all should check it out sometime (actually, it is a lot of fun!).

      Just now on FNC - confirmation of the banned Al Samoud II missiles. The report was leaked earlier, but apparently Centcom now confirms it. Quick question - name the real weapons' inspectors from the following list: a) Hans Blix, b) US Marines, c) French.    Tune in later for the results. The winner gets a prize.

      Good news is coming in from the front. It appears that one, if not two, Republican Guard divisions  urlLink have been destroyed . If the term destroyed as used by Gen. Vincent Brooks is similar to that used in parlance by we civilians, that's a great thing. In a matter of days, the crack troops of the Hussein regime have either surrendered, fled in disarray or been blown to bits.      This proves exactly what's wrong with arm-chair generals and partisan fools (I use the term "fools" to classify those who would say the sky is red just because a member of the opposite party said it was blue). The war is clearly going well. I am no grand military strategist, and the knowledge of military strategy I do have comes from history classes where the professor gleans over the strategy part of conflict, leaving one to interpret the diagrams of troop movements on one's own, but everyone should understand that no force can achieve victory in modern war if it does not possess comparable air power to its opponent.     No matter how hardened the now-destroyed Baghdad and Medina divisions were, they were destined for defeat.  Without air cover, these divisions were at our mercy from above. No doubt the B-52s simply pounded them into oblivion. Why the arm-chair generals and other naysayers could not see something this simple is mind-boggling. The worst part is that these people get paid to be on national TV and be wrong. I suppose it goes back to the widespread and irresistable Vietnam comparison. I reiterate, and cannot stress strongly enough that this is NOT Vietnam. Vietnam has minimal comparative value to any war we will fight in the future. To think any administration, and any pentagon, would allow itself to pursue a defensive war, saddled with absolutely silly rules of engagement, is insulting, whether it be a Democrat or Republican. This war is about victory - if Iran or Syria continue to supply the Iraqi regime, I have no doubt there will be massive explosions heard on the other side of each respective border, with no apologies. Syria is no Cambodia. We will not be afraid to send in troops and let the world know it if it becomes necessary.       As the elite Iraqi troops fold, I keep my fingers crossed. No war is easy, but we know we haven't gotten to the hardest part of this one yet. Our servicemen and women are now in the red zone, within chemical and biological weapons range. If Saddam (contingent, of course, on him being alive, seeing as he misses his own speeches nowadays) orders the use of WMDs, Allah help all who fight for him.

      There has been much posted in the blogosphere having to do with inapt comparisons of the current liberation of Iraq with our experience in Vietnam.  The general consensus, and I believe it to be an accurate one, is that as far as wars go, this one has more in common with World War I and II than Vietnam or Korea.  The scale is obviously smaller, and our enemy is conventionally outgunned, and if need be, outmanned, but the concept and goals are similar. We are embarking on a war of liberation, with the assistance of our most steadfast ally, against an enemy with expansionist aims who repeatedly vocalizes ill will against the civilized world.     The ruthlessness of our enemy is unparalleled. Saddam Hussein is of the same mold as that of Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler. We can only be thankful his resources are fewer and his military acumen less developed. His brutality towards his own people is unlimited. He practices extermination based on both race and dissent. He rules through fear, and enforces his will through a combination of threats and brainwashing. The Fedayeen are the Stasi of his regime, spying on all and showing mercy for none. He blows up markets and kills his own for the benefit of public relations. His regime is based on lies, and his hold on power balances on the tip of the bayonet. He likely kills more of his own each year than we will, by accident, in this war.     Tell me again what is unjust about our intervention in Iraq? The answer is painstakingly simple for those on the Left who like to complicate things - there is  nothing  unjust about what we are now doing. We should have done it sooner, and there are other countries where we ought to do it in the future.

      I like Geraldo Rivera. I know many who don't, but that rumor about him being "disembedded" has done nothing but raise his profile and stature as a journalist. Everyone knows that the first rule of verbal combat is never to address the opposition directly - it's important to maintain some sort of dehumanization lest you give credence to your opponent's views. If it is truly the "rats" at MSNBC who started this rumor, I am in a chronic state of scratching my head to figure out why. Surely such a lie would be easily found out. Point proven - no sooner had I read that the pentagon had issued Private Rivera a one-way pass back to Kuwait City, I glance over at Fox News and there he is!     In addition to Peter "Baghdad Rose" Arnett, the brains behind that rumor ought to be fired. And  urlLink Reuters  ought to do a better job of confirming their facts.

      Just to add to the last post - running a well thought out and intelligent blog is  hard . Glenn Reynold, Eugene Volokh, etc. are masters of the craft. It's very time consuming, and once you have a regular audience, it becomes ever the more imperative to maintain a high standard of content and timely posts.      I'm not quite to that point, though I do think it would be fun.

      I suppose I ought to be more regular in my posting. I was just informed that my blog was added to a list of local DC bloggers. Fair enough - I've since moved out of the area, but I'll take the plug - and run with it.     For those who care, I lived in Northern Virginia for three years, bouncing back and forth between Courthouse in north Arlington and Crystal City in the south. I enjoyed it, but am glad to be back in my native Tennessee.  The real world has a nice flavor once you've been a Washingtonian for a little while. For me, it didn't take all that long.     Don't get me wrong - Washington is a great place to visit, and I love to go back every now and again,  but between the traffic on the Beltway and the pervasive smell of ego in the air, I prefer more humble surroundings...

      And  urlLink this  provides us with a much-pressing question...is the Syrian leadership stupid? Are they not witnessing what is now happening in Iraq?

If we completely obliterated the Iraqi miliary in three weeks, how long do they think they would last? It appears they must still be working under the Mogadishu philosophy.

      This kind of thing  urlLink irritates me .  I know Robert Fisk is  the Old Faithful of anti-American polemicists, but please....can you  not get it  just a little more?     When it comes to anti-Americanism my usual reaction is one of pity. For the most part, the people who chant and parrot anti-American slogans are simply ignorant. It is pitiful that they can look out their window, get on the bus, go to dinner, and turn on the television and still not understand they live in history's greatest beacon of freedom. Worse, if they actually took the time to read the most basic summary of the last two hundred years the righteousness of our nation becomes indisputable.     Despite having the greatest opportunity in history on two separate occasions in the last sixty years, we chose not to occupy, but to rebuild. Other smaller events, such as our actions in Yugoslavia and Kuwait, also show our hesitancy, and at some level, ideological inability, to permanently occupy any country. We love freedom, and oddly enough, tend to also rebuild the societies of those who had attempted to dominate us.  If we were truly imperialistic, who could stand up to our might? Why would we choose Iraq? Could France defend herself from us? Could South Korea? Could Saudi Arabia? Of course not. But that's the unfortunate truth.     My biggest problem with the Left today, and specifically those who are anti-American in their tendencies, is that they have no regard for the facts. Facts are an inconvenience. Arguments are based on the wind, essentially, expressing contempt for any suggestion of absolutes and therefore having the luxury of never being wrong. The unfortunate addendum to this is that those who should be ignoring them instead celebrate them.  The media outlets of our country and others (to include the BBC and al Jazeera) foment ignorance on a mass scale.  I certainly will admit their are moments in our past that are less than proud, but they are DWARFED by those times in history that by any objective account are admirable and that should be celebrated. Our most bloody conflict came in the process of ending the enslavement of another race. What other nation can claim such a history?    We are not a racist nation. We are not an empire-building nation. All those under the power of the United States government choose to be there.  We are made of 50 formerly independent states, and a  handful  of territories.  Iraq will not remain in our control any longer than it takes to set up a democratic government. The Iraqis don't seem to mind our presence. They walk past our tanks without fear, and kiss our soldiers like old friends. I ask Robert Fisk, and others like him, why? Why do you oppose such a force for good? What is in it for you? Some are ignorant, but Fisk is intelligent. I am puzzled. Some folks are educated beyond their intelligence, but I don't believe that is the case here. There is an ulterior motive, though I don't know what it is...

      Three weeks in, and Saddam's government no longer operates. Watching the scenes on the street, and those certain to come, one only wishes we hadn't dithered about in the UN for all that time.  This victory, in such a short period of time, demonstrates just how useless that organization really is. If Germany and France had gotten their way, we would still be debating the freedom of the Iraqi people. Instead, we have delivered it.

      What an inspirational morning! It appears to resemble a cross between Eastern Europe 1989 and Paris 1944. Either one works, though of course the fall of communism is much more fresh in our collective memories. Plus that statue felled in Baghdad was rather Stalinesque. Wow. Of course, the wonderful commentary on CNN and MSNBC points out repeatedly that there's still a lot more to do - almost, it seems, attempting to marginalize the significance of the moment. In fact, completely missing the significance.     While true that we have mopping up to do, the fact that we are watching a people, who have been completely oppressed for over a generation, taste real freedom for the first time, well, it just makes your heart jump and your spine tingle. At least it does mine. This is awesome. The followup, impromptu rally in Dearborn, MI of Iraqi expats is equally compelling. The naysayers, the shortsighted analysts, are wrong. They will still be employed tomorrow, though, which is sad.     Freedom is chronically discounted by the realpolitik and liberal establishments. Why, I don't know. Just imagine, if you will, the Middle East today if this had happened in 1991. The complexion would be much improved, and democracy may be more widespread. This is only the beginning.

      I just feel the need to note this because of the depressingly short attention span of our national consciousness. The War on Terror has still just begun...Afghanistan and Iraq are just battles in the greater scheme of ending the threat of nuclear terrorism.  I in no way discount the importance of either, nor do I diminish the sacrifice, honor, and bravery of our men and women fighting for our nation, but a perspective wrought with patience is a necessity if we are to see the eradication of Islamism through. There is no middle ground to be had. Every harbinger of destruction has told the world what he was to do before he did it, from the Romans (in Carthage, among others) to Lenin to Hitler. The world, characteristically, ignores such warnings, and always at its peril.  We must remember 9/11, and the we must imagine a nuclear device aboard one of those planes. Now let's look at Syria, Iran and North Korea.

       Free Speech - What Does It Mean?      I just read an  urlLink article  about Tim Robbins, the ubiquitous boy toy of Susan Sarandon, and his perceived trampling of his free speech rights (courtesy of  urlLink Drudge ). His rant, as it were, appears to be a scathing rebuke of all who inhibit his and Ms. Sarandon's self expression. Robbins' ire is primarily focused on the Baseball Hall of Fame and its president, Dale Petroskey, for Petroskey's refusal to honor Robbins' movie, Bull Durham, due to Robbins' recent comments opposing the liberation of Iraq.     Someone needs to hand Mr. Robbins a copy of the Constitution, and fast. The 1st Amendment does, in fact, protect one's ability to speak freely. It also has these other things about press, religion, and assembly. All are very important, and all should be fought for.  But...they apply to the government. Mr. Robbins is mad (that's what he is, mad...it's a childish emotion, and a childish argument, by a routinely childish man) at a  private  individual, unassociated with the government, in charge of a private institution, doing a voluntary thing, which he has now decided he no longer wants to do.  The Supreme Court has held that free speech is a protected right, but that the very best speech is not, i.e. you can't always say everything you want to say the way you want to say it, but you can still say it.    Despite all the chicken little calls about the Patriot Act, the censoring of adverse opinion, and the suppression of free speech, the current administration has done  nothing  to impede Mr. Robbins' and his cohorts in idiocy from speaking their collective minds.  Black helicopters do not follow their limos, and men in black are not knocking at their door. In short, Mr. Robbins must understand that his 1st Amendment rights are alive and well, just that his opinions are not respected. A blow to the ego, I know, but the reality is that once you have something to say, I will indeed listen. So far, color me unimpressed.

      Not only is Australia a true friend to the United States, who isn't afraid to put her resources where her mouth is, her prime minister is also  urlLink tired of the French .  Though I must disagree that France was a global power at the end of WWII (only the US and the USSR were capable of such a feat, postwar), the sentiment is shared.    France out of the Security Council of the UN would be a welcomed development, and might actually salvage the usefulness of the organization itself. Unfortunately, the side effects of such a salvage operation are negative. Russia and China value France as an ally, and would likely bolt the Council if the French were required to eat their croissants on the curb. Keeping both these giant countries engaged is important. Europe can't counterbalance us internationally, but a Chinese-Russian alliance could, and in a much more hostile way.  Germany and France play diplomatic games with their egos. China and Russia play the same games with nuclear missiles.

      I had noticed this trend, and I'm glad someone who gets paid to do it has put together an  urlLink article  summarizing the hypocrisy and intentional pollyanna-ism of the Left in the war.  Casually reading many opinion and "news" pieces, it seems the antiwar Left is hedging itself, once again, attempting to say they always knew the war would be easy, and that they were always concerned more with the aftermath, the so-called "winning of the peace." This is nothing more than dishonest hawgwash.     First, it is silliness to ever say "winning the peace" is more difficult than winning the war. Anyone who thinks administrative housekeeping, and delivering food and water is more difficult than dodging bullets, suicide bombers and artillery pieces is either very naive about the reality of war or intentionally dishonest.  It's a general feel, of course, because citing repeatedly is burdensome when there are other things you have to do, but it seems there are many who were pining for a replay of Stalingrad in Baghdad, who wished our soldiers dead (or who wished an outcome that could only come about with many of our soldiers killed), or at the very least rubbed their hands together in glee when the looting began, and whimper with disappointment as it starts to wane.     Remember, this is all happening within a month. The war, the aftermath, the chaos...it is all contained within a thirty day period. And yet, some still appear unsatisfied.  If you are angry about the conduct of this war, and the resolution and recreation of Iraq in a democratic image, there is, quite simply, something incredibly wrong with you. You are more partisan than civil....you prefer death and destruction for the sake of your apparently insatiable ego.  Nothing is more important than vindication, even thousands dead. Tortured and imprisoned children, raped daughters, wives and mothers, wood chipped dissenters, all are acceptable as long as inspections continued. A million Mogadishus are ok, just to show the US a lesson.     People who think this way are sick. For the safety of our posterity, and the continued strength of our nation, they should be ignored, no matter what their number (and right now, it is small, but loud). The adults, finally are in the White House. We who put them there must remember to ignore the children, and keep them there in 2004.

      Despite this  urlLink article's  muddled style, it brings once again to the fore an improper focus on the looting (which we now know to have been rather minor) of Iraq's museum (the best I can tell, there is only one).  Somehow, protecting the oil producing capacity is less important than protecting the museum.    Appreciating history is important, and as a culture we do a pretty good job of it. However, if I had to choose between rebuilding my country's water purification plants, rebuilding the government apparatus and feeding my family and friends, or, preserving a few artifacts, I would hope the choice would be clear. The oil revenues will provide Iraq with a headstart in its effort to rebuild and provide for its citizenry. Perhaps we could have done both, protected the necessities, and also protected the niceties. But such an assertion requires perfection. We just fought a war where the opposition killed more of its civilians, by far, than we did. We aren't perfect, but we're closer than anyone has ever come...ever.

      There has been much to scoff at in the world of kneejerk war reactions. Surely, the liberation of Iraq was for oil. Surely, it was just a big business deal to enrich the shareholders of Halliburton and  urlLink Bechtel .    There is one response to such nutty assertions - look at the facts. First, what would you rather us do? Leave Iraq the way it is, or better, kill some civilians to vindicate your clueless prewar predictions? What is it that you people want? I have an idea of what you want, and it goes no further than petty politics. Being one who loves politics, I can appreciate the desire to make gains for one's particular ideology or party. However, the desire to mar the coalition victory with charges of profiteering by its associates gets one nowhere.    The great thing about America, and the thing that liberals (modern liberals, not classic liberals) miss, is that we are the most capitalist economy of size in the world. We gain our power, and our power to exist, from the entrepreneurial talents and wealth creating activities of our citizenry. The rights protected under the Constitution allow our economic system to continue and grow. I don't remember who said it, but I thoroughly agree with it. The greatest asset of America, besides her people, is that we are the largest free trade zone in the world.    Now, knowing this, doesn't it make sense that an American company would be the proper choice to rebuild Iraq? From what I can gather, the only other enterprise who could handle a project of this size was a French concern. It doesn't quite seem proper to reward the French for their unapologetic intransigence in international affairs, who did everything thing they could, short of taking up arms, to thwart the liberation of the Iraqi people.    So we are left with American companies. How horrid!!! How despicable!!! How silly for anyone paid by the New York Times to bring it up because it has no journalistic value whatsoever!!!

      So...talk about ingratitude...Shiites, who are now able to conduct their religion as they want, now that Hussein is no more, are protesting the American and British presence in Iraq. I believe Shakespeare had a good line about ingratitude in  Twelth Night , something about it being the most distasteful vice of all, but that is neither here nor there. What we have on our hands is a potential tyrrany of the majority, with certain Shiite leaders bent on creating an Islamic theocracy - essentially, Iran II.  A truly representative government must be set up - and there must be a strictly enforced 1st Amendment included in it.

I can't remember Bush or any administration official ever attempting to link Iraq to the attacks on 9/11. Why this lie seems to have such traction is beyond me. Additionally, we knew, from 1991, that Iraq had WMDs. Where they went is now the current question. The problem with materials such as VX is that it doesn't take much to cause extensive damages. A ton of liquid is easy to conceal in a large enough space. That ton effectively released in midtown Manhattan would be catastrophic.

      Just returned home from a family get-together in Tifton, Georgia. No cable...no internet access...kinda relaxing.    Now, back to some intermittent blogging (intermittent being the best I ever do...).   The Tennessean  has a lead story on the  urlLink controversial nature  of allowing teachers to use test scores to satisfy the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act. The story is a bit choppy, but the gist is that some teachers want to use their students' improved test scores to reach the level of "highly qualified" under the Act, but still keep the results of the students connected with each teacher confidential.     Naturally,  The Tennessean  misses the point of the story. The point is not that some teachers want to use the scores, when favorable, to satisfy themselves as "highly qualified" under the federal law, but that they want to do so without releasing the scores to the general public. Anyone who knows me knows of my recurrent ranting against a general lack of accountability in education, but I can see some merit to not taking the scores associated with these teachers and dropping them on the street corner for all to persuse. However, there are some individuals not employed by the education apparatus who do deserve to see the scores - the parents.    Let me make a simple metaphor. Say you have a family, and you're interested in their safety. You are searching for a new car. You want a new car that has a lot of value for your dollar, but you also want to make sure that a large portion of that value can be found in enhanced safety features. Unfortunately, you can only get one rating for that car - "high value." Unfortunately, you don't know if that's because the car has a really good engine, or whether it has enhanced side based air bags. The same problem exists here. It's terrible, I suppose, that some incompetent teachers be found out, their feelings hurt, and, God forbid, pressure is brought down upon them from parents to do a better job.   The point is clear. There is one quote in the article from an alarmingly clueless parent about how a teacher can be "highly qualified" based on other factors beside academic performance, such as "by how they interact with the kids."  I'll bet a dollar to a donut that most parents don't feel that way (but leave it to my illustrious Gannett ragged hometown paper to find the one). I don't care how the teacher interacts with the kids, as long as it's effective. One way to check on that is, despite the naysayers protests, test scores. If a teacher has been around for ten years, and the scores of that teacher's students is always below the median, we might want to do something about it. If my kid was going to have that teacher next Fall, I'd sure want to know.

      It has been said by James Taranto of OpinionJournal.com that the road to peace in the Middle East, and specifically Israel, goes through Baghdad. I submit this was true, and if my geography is at all accurate, you have to go through Damascus to get back to the West Bank.    I'm very curious to see what track the Bush administration pursues in its dealings with Syria.  Clearly, Syria is the main troublemaker in the Israeli - Palestinean problem.  Lebanon is essentially a client state, a terrorism franchise, if you will, and acts to enable a multifront war on the Israeli people. The Syrian leadership, after showing great stupidity in the midst of the fall of Hussein's government, appears to be coming around...somewhat. If they respond to verbal pressure, we should increase it. Couple it with a few carriers hanging off the Mediterranean coast, and we'll get some good results.    Besides, we have some unfinished business in Lebanon.  Remember, our greatest losses in Lebanon in the 1980s were at the hands of Hezbollah - we've got 241 US Marines to avenge.

      These  urlLink poll numbers  are worth checking out. It appears that attention spans are short, and Bush needs to do a better marketing job. There's plenty of time, though, and a full-court marketing blitz, even for the best ideas, would be wasted this far out from the general election.     The "strong leader" numbers are positive, and I think those will play the most significant role of any facet polled. We'll see...but the fact remains that among DEMOCRATS, nearly 2/3 can't name anyone running for their own party's nomination. Scary if you bleed donkey.

      The Sox won - so the morning is bright, crisp, and can simply be summed up in the word of happiness.   I haven't yet had a chance to expound on the ESPN handling of the Rush situation. I don't have much time now - I need to be out of the house in about five minutes, but I thought I would go ahead and get started anyhow.   I haven't seen too much commentary on last Sunday's Gameday Countdown.  Maybe the mushy feel-good, yet completely wrong, way the members of the cast, from Chris Berman down, conveyed their "feelings" was all too expected. I was still taken aback at the extremity of the pandering though. The gist of everyone's comments (primarily those of Tom Jackson, and in a roundabout way, Berman) was that they were wrong, not Rush - that's assumed - but they were wrong for their apathy when Rush made his allegedly insensitive comments.  It immediately struck me as telling that it took them a week, and apparently pressure from the same media Rush was criticizing, to come up with this hoolala.  The point had been made. No one in the case seemed to take offense at the time of the comments. It took others to pressure them into thinking "correctly."  I have more, especially on Tom Jackson, who has eternally lost any personal respect coming from yours truly. Wilson County is calling, and I can't be late.

      I also want to go on record saying that those Comcast dish-bashing commercials are completely bogus. We just got DirecTV a month ago, and it's worked beautifully.

      Meanwhile, California is about ripe.  And quite frankly, they're about to get what they so richly deserve.    First, they elect Grey Davis, not once, but twice. Then, they change their mind. Next, they poll evenly between an unprincipled actor and an arguably racist communist for weeks. Now, they appear to have decided on the unprincipled actor.  When's the big one coming?

      Out of a morbid curiosity, I decided to check out Dennis Kucinich's web site (since he just announced his candidacy and all), and it was worse than even I had imagined.  I've finally found what I've been trying to put my finger on for months...Kucinich is the anti-Galt - he's the perfect establishment candidate of  Atlas Shrugged , combined with the destructive ideals of  1984 .    Fortunately, there is no hope this kook will be elected. But to know there are people in public office who think this way is a disheartening. The people of Cleveland - you disappoint me deeply.

      I think we should  urlLink encourage our seniors to go north for  prescription drugs.   In a basic economic sense, we're simply shifting costs. In a sense this is an exemplary case of comparative advantage. Let me explain.  Two governments are in the model: the United States and Canada. Due to the still-open border between the two, and the short distance between population centers, transaction costs are low. The Canadian government has chosen to subsidize prescription drugs (and healthcare in general) for its citizens, and apparently, for anyone else who chooses to buy them within Canada's borders. In a broader view, Canada has spent extensive time and effort developing its welfare state.  Here, Canada is providing subsidies to a certain subset of American citizens the rest of the American public has chosen not to provide. At first blush it appears that our seniors are mooching off of the Canadian welfare state, resulting in a direct and uncompensated expense to Canada. Let's expand the analysis.  Canada itself has been a free-rider under the United States military and economic umbrella for years, and remains so to this day.  In the nineteenth century American proved a buffer for Canada from Mexico, and throughout the twentieth century, the United States has intervened across the world in wars and conflicts where America's and Canada's interests have been closely aligned. The United States has proven its superiority at defense, while Canada has shown its tendency to provide social services. The current War on Terror and American leadership and resource commitment are only the latest example. Canada has provided token assistance, but such assistance is miniscule compared to the resources, both absolutely and as a percentage of GDP, that the United States has deployed.  Economically, Canadian business has access to the largest and wealthiest market in the world at little cost. This access surely results in sufficient economic activity and tax revenues for the Canadian government to compensate for any subsidies provided to American seniors buying drugs north of the border. If at worst the added tax revenues from American market access wash with the prescription subsidies, the "use" of the American military more than compensates for the extra trouble.

      The assessment of the Oprah survey is a bit problematic. The conclusion is that   "However, the most likely conclusion we can make is that people who seek out Oprah's life-affirming TV are probably just more aware, open and honest with their emotions."  I think they're emotional wrecks. Part of having emotions and functioning in reality is learning when to let them go, and when to control them.  I'm not saying Oprah causes her watchers to lead stressed-out, basically unhappy lives, but I am saying that perhaps her format and message exacerbates the stress in people's lives that would otherwise not rise to the level of "hectic." Ratifying stress doesn't help it - if anything, it encourages it.

      Somehow,  urlLink this  is not surprising. From the few times lately I've watched the show, and the many more I had to watch it when Mom controlled the television growing up, Oprah has made a living pointing out every middle-aged woman's faults and telling her that they're OK, to probably include some faults they didn't even know they had.  Now, with the Dr. Phil spinoff, you have an entirely new hour of fault-based programming where the central theme of the show is telling people how utterly stupid they're acting. Now, obviously, sometimes this assessment is completely accurate, but it can't be good for the overall self-image. I personally wouldn't want to be on a nationally broadcast feel-bad show where my utter unability to comprehend daily life is exposed and I'm made to bawl like Cubs fan on-stage.  Maybe the people who do this get a Dr. Phil prizepack, with some extra Weight Watchers items autographed by Dr. Phil. Maybe, though, they are just that pathetic.

      As Dennis Miller so eloquently quipped about the Democratic field  I havent seen a starting nine like that since the 1962 Mets.    This election cycle is primed for expansive Republican gains on the national and state levels.  I had been debating whether President Bush would have coattails down the ballot.  Because of a variety of factors, I am now convinced he will.  First, and perhaps most important, Democratic turnout and Democratic appeal to swing voters have become mutually exclusive outcomes.  The only candidate that truly excites the Democratic base is a quasi-communist governor from a non-diverse, non-mainstream New England state, who has only McGovernite appeal to the broader electorate.  The only other candidates who are viable are those who are slightly more to the right of Leonid Brezhnev than the good governor from Vermont, to include John F. Kerry and Dick Gephardt (Clark will doubtlessly fade).  Unfortunately for the Democratic Party, the latter excite the base about as much as a broad-based tax cut.  Without turnout, the Democratic candidate for president will be doomed, and any Democratic candidates down the ticket will suffer the extended consequences.  Another factor that will certainly damage any national plans the Democrats have is the status of California. A Republican governor there now creates a strategic problem, potentially wresting away a key state that was once solidly in the Democratic camp.  The Democrats have no national victory strategy that does not include California.  I am not quite convinced California is winnable for a more conservative Republican, but Governor Schwarzeneggar makes it interesting, as he will certainly stump heavily for President Bush.  Millions of  Democratic dollars earmarked for battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania will have to be diverted to ensure California voters dont drift to the red (well, the electoral red).   Combined with a lack of Democratic turnout, and a new battleground state, Bushs positive popularity itself will enhance Republican turnout.  The economic numbers now being released are a sure sign that domestic issues might become nonissues by next November.  With a chicken now in every pot, the national focus will be forced to return to national security and the War on Terror. This is where our President is at his best, and where Democrats lack credibility the most.

      Am I missing something  urlLink here ? Hasn't Bush acknowledged the sacrifice and loss of American life in Iraq repeatedly?   The problem is not as The Tennessean (or, Pravda on the Cumberland, as we locals oft-times call it) puts it.  The problems Bush and others in the administration have noted with media coverage of the war stems from the tunnel-vision mentality of most media outlets.  Yes, soldiers are dying. No one welcomes it, but it's an unfortunate cost for something larger than any one individual. Media outlets such as The Tennessean miss the point. Every loss of life is tragic, but the losses are not in vain, as much as Gannett rags and others would have us believe.

      OK, I just took that compass test, and refuse to post my score. Here's why - the questions are crap.  I knew I would come out on the right - but my authoritarian number is out of line.  The questions that I detected had something to do with  the authoritarian axis seemed to be too vague to ensure accurate weighting. For instance, thinking that hippies are really immature seems to throw one toward the authoritarian side of things. Additionally, questions that ask one's opinions on society seem to weigh into one's perceived role of the government.   Of course I think entertainment infused into "news" has created shorter attention spans. Does that mean I think the government should regulate it? Of course not. The abortion question doesn't make sense either in this context, and shouldn't be used to weigh whether one is an authoritarian or not. An individual who is pro-life is typically so because they are anti-murder, not because they believe the government should interfere with personal liberty. By this logic, anyone who believes in the criminal penal code is authoritarian. If this is what the test means by authoritarian, its measurements are largely useless unless viewed from an anarchist's perspective.  Whether something is advisable does not go to whether it should be permissable, and I think that is where this test fails miserably.

      Just looked at the  urlLink Political Compass  again.  I took it awhile back, but don't quite remember how I came out. I was about to take it again, when I became decidedly perturbed by the opening question. Apparently, frictionless commerce is incompatible with "humanity." I'm not quite sure what to do with this one.   I suppose I'll choose a less decisive answer to the first question and answer the rest. The remaining questions on the front page seem a little more fair.  It seems the compass does get a little play throughout the blogosphere, but I'm more inclined along the lines of Jacob Levy's  urlLink assessment .

This  urlLink article  is a little dated, but provides estimates on Chinese manufacturing productivity over the last twenty years, and attempts to explain and account for inaccuracies in the government released data.

      Andrew Sullivan's  urlLink commentary  on the similarities of John Kennedy and George W. Bush is interesting, and largely accurate.  I take exception with the last line of the analysis, however.  I'm not sure whether Bush is an "old-style Democrat" on foreign policy, or if he is, whether that is the best way to characterize him. That assertion seems to be mutually exclusive, as in Bush isn't like "old-style Republicans" when it comes to American foreign policy, because the best way to describe him is as an "old-style Democrat."  Of course, the crux of Sullivan's conclusion is that the Democrats are missing the obvious when they criticize the President's foreign policy.  This is undoubtedly true, and is an example of the symptomatic venom that is the modus operandi of 21st century Democrats.  The reason for this intraparty intransigence (if you accept that Bush is in fact an old-style Democrat in his foreign policy) lies in the complete devolution of the modern Democratic Party from the Democratic Party of forty years ago.  Neither Kennedy nor Wilson (if you truly want to go back to the old-style Democrat model) would recognize his party today.   Bush as an Old-Style Republican   I see Bush as consistent with Republican foreign policy objectives, recently reaffirmed by Ronald Reagan, and stretching back to Theodore Roosevelt.  International political theorists have at times implied, if not outright stated, that Rooseveltian foreign policy is incompatible with Wilsonian foreign policy.  This is quite simply not true. The objectives and means of each philosophy actually mix and match quite effectively.  Wilson, a reluctant warrior, eventually staked his place in history on a diplomatic initiative. He believed, as it appears President Bush does, that the worldwide expansion of democracy is in the best interests of the United States. The difference lies in a perception of international relations.  Bush appears to understand, as did Roosevelt, that treaties are only enforceable by tip of the sword.  Countries behave as though in a Hobbesian state of nature, with no governing rules save those imposed by the more powerful. Frameworks don't enforce themselves, as evidenced by the recurrent impotence of the United Nations in dealing with Iraq.   Post 9-11, the result of our foreign policy, that the United States should pursue whatever course is in its best interests, is purely Rooseveltian. Bush's methods follow a more Roosevelt-inspired path, with the added Wilsonian modification that the end-result of worldwide democracy makes the United States, and the world, a safer and more secure place.  In short, since the beginning of the Cold War, Rooseveltian means have been the key to both Rooseveltian and Wilsonian ends. In the new, one hyper-power world, where the slightest margin of error could result in cataclysmic destruction, this merger of the two philosophies seems to be the proper bet.

       urlLink This  is disgusting. There's such a thing as prosecutorial discretion.  The concept must be lost on the district attorney's office in the Bronx.  This unfortunate story puts good people in a bad position.  Criminal justice has three potential purposes, depending on your philosophy: deterrence, retribution, or rehabilitation. Which purpose does this prosecution serve? That's right - none. Deterring the elderly, or law abiding citizens in general, from defending themselves is not in the best interest of any sane society. There is no retribution to be had. This gentlemen positively affected his community by preventing another violent crime. If anything, the state, on behalf of the people of the Bronx, owe him. And finally, what do we want to rehabilitate this man from? A keen sense of self-preservation? An intolerance for robbery?   This kind of incident is what makes me sick. Unfortunately, I am sure it would happen in most jurisdictions. From my observations here in Nashville (among other things, I do practice criminal defense), I'm not convinced it wouldn't happen here, either.

      Just finished watching the opening of The Daily Show - complete and accurate coverage of the MTV Dem Debate. Wow. Are these guys for real? Those videos are perhaps the funniest thing I've seen in a long, long time.   Nice clip from Dean - the Democrats should get the votes of poor white people, too. Hmm, yet another group, but is it a minority? e.g. a potential Democratic voting block?  Only if they forget about God, guns, and gays, I suppose...

Properly categorizing the anthropological reasoning ability of the frontrunners in the current Democratic field is beyond the scope of this blog and the expertise of its author.

      This  urlLink reported use  of the Patriot Act to attack a strip club is, to me, alarming.  Clearly, such a use of the act was NOT what was originally intended.  As far as legal analysis goes, I'm not one who buys into the often-harped, seldom realized "slippery slope" argument.  Quite frankly, most slopes don't turn out to be slippery. You're fine one minute, and the next minute, you fall straight down. You clearly know when things have gone too far. It's not a gradual regression.  This, however, appears to be one of those times when the spirit of the law ought to be invoked. Whether or not you personally believe strip clubs to be patriotic in their nature, reasonable people can (and would) agree that the Patriot Act was not designed to bag small-time corrupt activity.  This reminds me of the devolution of the RICO statute, which was originally designed to break up organized crime, but as of late has been successfully applied to distasteful corporate activity.  Somewhere along the way the original purpose of the act is lost, and the landscape of the law is drastically altered.

      Good eyes by  urlLink Vodkapundit :  "Barbour entered the race as a nationally known Republican who had not been a full-time resident of Mississippi in years. But in a state that has grown increasingly Republican yet remains among the poorest, Barbour told voters how his contacts in Washington and among corporate leaders could benefit Mississippi economically."   Three things - number one, Republican tendencies do not equal poverty. Second, the Republican Party does indeed consist of those who want to better their life. And third, anyone heard of Hillary Clinton? I don't even think the woman had lived in New York a second before running for a statewide office.  Once you scalp the Post article of the heady claims of Republican inferiority, lack of residence, and what appears to be utter surprise that poor people vote Republican, you're left with "Haley Barbour has been elected governor of Mississippi."

      Yesterday was a hectic day - which is fine. Hectic usually means productive, and this case was no exception.   The Democratic  urlLink memo  leaked when circulated among the Senate Intelligence Committee is alarming, though not startling.   urlLink Claims  by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, ranking minority member on the Select Committee for Intelligence, that that the memo was "likely taken from a waste basket or through unauthorized computer access," are irrelevant, at best.  The problem with the memo lies in its pronounced strategy to use intelligence information and the intelligence evaluation process for political purposes.  Per the Democratic Party, the purpose of the committee is not to evaluate our nation's intelligence network, but instead exists only to act as another torpedo to be fired at the administration.  For shame, both for what the Dems in the committee are doing, and for a pattern of behavior where the strategy outlined in this memo is not at all surprising.

      Just a side note... and I think I'll be done blogging for the night. I'm tired of every mention of a casualty in Iraq, followed by the following phrase, or something substantially like it - "the bloodiest day since Bush declared major combat over May 1."   For anyone out there who cares to listen, let me set something straight. There will be more American and British deaths and injuries. There will be more firefights and ambushes. The price of not obliterating a country in the course of liberation is the mass survival of regime loyalists as well as the mass survival of the general civilian population.  Major combat operations are indeed over. Anyone heard from the Republican Guard lately? Pick a division... they don't seem to be too coherent these days. Anyone seen Saddam's sons? Oh yeah, they're dead. How many cards are left in that 55 card deck? 15, I think (as of July) - it  could be less by now. How well are utilities throughout Iraq operating? Oh, better than before the liberation. Is oil flowing out of Iraq? Why yes, it is. How many wives, sisters and daughters have been raped by American servicemen? 0, zilch, none - which, I do add, is quite the contrast to the situation before we arrived.  So, as you can see, major combat operations are indeed over. The country is indeed recovering.  A few desperate Baathists are attempting to sabotage the new Iraq. By an objective account, they are  losing .

       urlLink Andrew Sullivan  has an interesting theory as to the how's and why's of the results of the latest Washington Post presidential  urlLink poll .  Bush's support in the 18-25 age group still amazes me.  It comports with other polls, though, and the overall trend is an encourageing one. For the life of me, I can't remember when the poll was done and who did it (I think it was Pew, and it was a couple of months ago), but the number of college students who supported George W. Bush's handling of the war in Iraq was over 60%, and at the time was tracking higher than the same approval rating given Bush by the general population.    Andrew Sullivan's theory, and I think it's largely on track, is that we are seeing the emergence of the 9-11 generation. I find myself hedging somewhat, however. As a disclaimer, I am an eternal optimist. One of my hobbies is reading biographies of successful people. Pessimists and cynics don't tend to accomplish great things. I am personally affronted when I feel a pessimistic urge or a cynical impulse coming on.  This is one of those times.  My small dose of cynicism lies in what some have individuals have called, and I routinely deride as, the MTV generation, whose members are typically characterized by an inability to determine what's really important in life, and doubly damning, also lack the attention span to make proper sense of their surroundings anyway. Perhaps what we're seeing here is a morphing, of sorts, away from a skewed and Clintonesque perception of reality to a true understanding of the world around them.  If this is indeed the case, and it actually looks as thought it may be, the Democratic Party as it currently exists is already dead.  A reliable volunteer base can usually be found on college campuses, as well as the next generation of academia engendered lock-step ideologically liberal drones. If this dries up...the outcome would make me ecstatic.  If the Republican Party ever could crack a third of the black vote in every election, there wouldn't be an elected Democrat anywhere outside of a gerrymandered district.  The demographic swing noted in the Washington Post poll, among others, could have the same effect.

       The Final Roll Call , which I mentioned in the last post, should encourage us, not sadden us. We as a people have a lot to do - the battle in the field is fought by the men and women in our military, but the battle of ideas, empowering those men and women, is fought at home.  For those of us who have any political experience whatsoever, we know the election cycle never truly ends. Viewed in hindsight through the dust fumed shadows of September 11, 2001, the 2000 election of George W. Bush was extraordinarily timely.  The re-election of George W. Bush is, on the contrary, a clear imperative. That election cycle is now upon us. The alternatives are, in a word, frightening.  The progress of the War (World War IV, I like to call it) relies on the outcome of the 2004 presidential election.   Any one of the Democratic candidates would roll back the gains now made.  In a game where one mistake can be fatal, any release of pressure is unacceptable.  We have not been attacked again since September 11, 2001.  Decisive action and a clear vision from the Commander-in-Chief are the reason.   I go on record now holding that the election of the eventual Democratic nominee in 2004 will result in the loss of a major American city. At the end of the day, quite plainly, the Democrats don't get it, haven't gotten it, and never will get it. Life is now too serious to play their race-baiting, class warfare, personal assassination, lie-based, discrimination-filled, hypocritical, and destructive brand of politics. A once-great party is on the verge of complete irrelevance. For the sake of our nation, let us hope they make it all the way there.

      I tend to go to this  urlLink site  every few days to ensure that my perspective is absolutely correct. Here you find a listing of all those who have died in service to us, the American people. It's important to think of their sacrifice in this way. They did not risk, and pay, the ultimate sacrifice for the United States government - they did it to preserve the American existence, our existence.  Everyone of us owes a debt we can never repay. The amazing thing is that these men and women who have died fighting for freedom, and those still fighting, do not desire we pay anything back. They freely give - their existence is one of complete selflessness.  That is amazing, and I am eternally grateful.

      Short on postings, I know...it'll probably be another few days before I can get a high speed connection in the new office. It'd be nice to be able to blog while settling in, organizing, etc., but it's just not in the cards.  It appears that both the Dow and NASDAQ performed admirably today.  But of course, leave it to the most talented journalists to  urlLink poo-poo  the exceptional economic growth we are currently experiencing.    So let me get this straight...business spending is important to the economy, check; consumer spending is important to the economy, check; business spending, predicated on industrial capacity (which becomes less and less relevant as we become more and more service oriented), is a lousy indicator of future spending trends, check; but nevertheless, the outlook is bleak, primarily, it seems, because a handful of financial analysts are once again insufficiently clairvoyant enough to predict the future in absolutely sunny terms.  Despite surrendering the fact that non-defense capital goods demand is a better indicator of future growth (which, by the way, is "surging") the article still concludes the worst.  The point is that the above story is actually a non-story, with the added benefit of grossly unsubstantiated pollyannaesque overtones - no matter how good the news actually is, it's bad news.

      For those out there who want our presence in Iraq to end quickly, here's some  urlLink good news .  That's only giving us another 7 months to stabilize the country, root out the Baathists, and set up a working constitution. I am skeptical as to the feasability of this timetable. If the administration can pull this off, it will be touted as one of the most successful foreign policy operations in history. I pray we can - but let's not pull out of Iraq for the sake of expediency, and at the expense of success. Iraq is the key to democracy in the Middle East. We must take full advantage of the opportunity before us.

      Okay, I guess I shouldn't be, but Kennedy's comment has made me furious.  First, and I will refuse to acknowledge any facet of the racial angle, because, quite frankly, our side doesn't do that. But I do take issue with his carte blanche asininity. Obviously - I repeat, obviously, the individuals Bush has nominated are among the best and brightest attorneys and jurists in the land.  I dare say the same about any president's judicial nominations. You don't get to the brink of a federal judgeship without being exceptionally bright, regardless of one's politics.  Kennedy, you're not worth the time.

      Vidal is lacking something very important to those in his field (that being critics), and that is perspective.  He posits that Franklin predicted, from the beginning, that imperfect people would eventually let themselves be ruled by despots. There are, in my mind, two logical ways to apply that fear from Franklin's perspective.    One is that Frankling was concerned about an overreaching government - one that would grow to a size that, by necessity of its existence, would squash people's freedoms. Today we are largely serviced by an army of bureaucrats at the federal and state levels of government.  If Vidal truly comprehended  Franklin's "presience," he would mention this point.   Second, Franklin was concerned with a return to what was just fought against. A true despot is an unelected king, who by fiat can exercise plenary power over his subjects' lives, to include life and death, taxes and military conscription, which were items of concern to a group of men who had just pledged their fortunes, lives, and sacred honor to a revolution a mere third of the populace thought was a good idea. Unlike  George III, George W. Bush was duly elected.  Only the zaniest of the Left argue otherwise, and do on purely emotional  basis devoid of any factual concerns.   My point, longwinded as it may be, is that Gore Vidal doesn't get it.

      Interesting  urlLink summary  of the latest Gallup poll out of Iraq.  The lowest number among Iraqis on the question of basic constitutional rights is on the question of right to assembly. Instapundit reports, but doesn't comment, on this anomaly in light of the rather high freedom of speech and religion numbers.  Perhaps this difference in Iraqi opinion goes back to a  urlLink perception  I read in an Iraq-based blog last week.  As best described by the author of the blog, demonstrations have been given a bad name by the Baathist regime.  Until the Iraqi public fully realizes that they get to  choose  where and when and for what they demonstrate, the public's approval number when responding to this type of question will likely continue to lag behind that of other 1st A. freedoms. Still, over two-thirds feel such a provision should be in the new constitution. The electorate's starting point is quite encouraging.   I just love that I can now refer to the Iraqi people as an "electorate" with a straight face.

Here's the quote:  US officials have said they suspect that foreign volunteers, including some from al-Qaida, have slipped across the borders into Iraq to take part in a "holy war" against the US-led occupation.   Asked about foreign fighters, Lt Gen Sanchez claimed that "hundreds" of  foreigners cross the border to carry out attacks.

      This is  urlLink disgusting .  Anti-semitism - the only prejudice left on the planet praised and encouraged in elitist circles.  Volokh makes the good point that there are many reasons why government reports on societal ills are shelved. However, one would hope we could give the EU the benefit of the doubt. Europe's collective history of anti-semitism, from east to west, is abyssmal, and reports from the continent, from Islamist vandalism of synagogues, to the snappy racist comments of European diplomats, show many have not learned anything.   Europe once again shows which side of the Atlantic has truly progressed.  If this report was shelved for solely PC reasons, there is truly a deep and ingrained problem in the European mindset. Can anyone imagine a similar report being shelved here? about blacks? or Hispanics? Would there be silence? Or would there be protests and public outcry? Would we be collectively ashamed, or would we show our true stripes through our passivity? The EU, it appears, has shown its true stripes.

      Interesting  urlLink perspective  the  Washington Post  takes on the formation of militia in Iraq to assist in counterterrorism.  There are enough negative quotes from members of the non-participating political parties - the point that is missed is this: gee, maybe Iraqis participating in the protection and formation of their own democratic nation is actually a good idea.  The American Revolution was largely fought and won with the use of local militia.  Anyone who knows history also knows that the period after the British surrender was not exactly a rosy one. So it goes with Iraq.  Fortunately for Iraqis, however, they have a living example of what works (or, a few of them, if they choose the parliamentary route).

Because of their proximity to Vermont, one might safely presume that New Hampshirites have some sort of insider knowledge of Howard Dean. If that's the case, I like the result.

It's nice to see some sort of truly quasi-pro-democracy demos on our elite college campuses.    Somehow, I get this irksome feeling that the same people who make Tibet their pet cause are the same people who would love to have an evening cigar with Fidel Castro. Perhaps that's just an inference I've gathered on my own. It could come from the general Hollywood obsession with both Tibet and Castro. Maybe they don't overlap - if they do, it's quite the rich contradiction.

      It's unbelievable that so many in the world community are so weak in their constitutions (personal, not national) that whether or not Saddam Hussein deserves to live is actually a viable question.  Of course it's not.  The only punishment short of death that fits Saddam's heinous history is torture, and since we tend to frown upon such activity (though, assuredly, the Iraqis who try him may not frown as big), the only punishment that metes out any justice whatsoever is death.  The question is not what Hussein actually did while ruler of Iraq. Those facts are known. For psychological effect and closure for the victims of his despotism, a full trial is necessary. Legally, however, the burden of proof has long ago been carried. What we will effectively have is a sentencing hearing.  The aggravating factors are many, and the mitigating factors are few. Insanity, I detect, will not be seen as a palpable defense.  Let's just add a little due process to the Romanian and Italian methods of dealing with oppressive rulers.

      CBS has an online  urlLink story  about the libertarian threat to Bush's reelection. The whole premise of the article is that the Libertarian candidate will draw a sufficient number of votes from Bush to throw the election to Kerry.  I just don't have much faith in the national party structure of the Libertarians. Additionally, Bush is proposing a reduction in domestic spending, which should bring the disenchanted back into the fold in sufficient numbers to make a libertarian electoral coup unlikely. We'll see. Something to consider, but nothing to sweat about.

      Bud Adams has expressed his expectation that Eddie George will be  urlLink released .  Having watched George, and what he's meant to the Titans over his career, it's difficult to think of the team without him. It's true his production has diminished over the last three years. I get a bit misty anytime ESPN Classic shows the Super Bowl against the Rams.  Watching the dominance and power of George as he used to be makes for a clear contrast to how he now is. Where he used to plow through three, sometimes four guys, he now falls to the turf.  For the future of the team, it's probably the right time for George to go. The Titans are a pass-centered offense now. Steve McNair is the team leader, and he's not going anywhere.

       urlLink Al Gore ...whose side is he on, again? I'm not speaking of honorable dissent. I'm not even speaking of the loyal opposition. What I'm speaking of is outright character assassination, spiced with vitriole and simmered in hatred (Gore's speech inspired me to overextend a metaphor or two).  Gore's rant shows us what he is truly made of, and further reinforces the conclusion that we was unfit to be commander-in-chief. Head of Party is perhaps the only presidential role he has a hope of fulfilling, and he can do that quite well from where he currently sits.  Let's do some fisking...   "an exotic new approach that asserted a unique and unilateral U.S. right to ignore international law ..."   Which international law have we ignored? The action in Afghanistan was not preemption. It was retaliation - self defense. The action in Iraq was in effect   enforcement  of international law, not the ignoring of it. How many resolutions lie irrelevant and dormant until President Bush chose to lead instead of kow-tow (sp?)?   "All that is required, in the view of Bush's team is the mere assertion of a possible, future threat - and the assertion need be made by only one person, the President"   Here Gore shows his nuanced (because, hey, all Democrats are nuanced) understanding of one of two key principles. First, the one his does not comprehend. it is not the "mere assertion of a possible, future threat" that entitles us to preemption action. It's the seriousness of that threat. If Monaco threatened invasion, we would likely not overthrow the Monaco monarchy. If a man of questionable sanity, who has in the past 1) invaded his neighbors multiple times, 2) attempted to assassinate a past US president, and 3), according to  everyone , possesses the most horrific WMD's, and now has a delivery vehicle for them (Al Qaeda), we probably ought to look into it.   Second, Al Gore is correct, that all military decisions are made by the Commander-in-Chief.    "Dominance is not really a strategic policy or political philosophy at all. It is a seductive illusion that tempts the powerful to satiate their hunger for more power still by striking a Faustian bargain. And as always happens - sooner or later - to those who shake hands with the devil, they find out too late that what they have given up in the bargain is their soul."   So, by liberating the entire populations of Afghanistan and Iraq, we have struck a deal with the devil? Given up our soul? Hyperbole soup, anyone? I go on record not wanting to worship the god of Al Gore - a god, apparently, who rejoices in the domination of others souls by brutal dictatorial regimes, who supports the systematic rape, torture and murder of its people.   What happened at the prison, it is now clear, was not the result of random acts by "a few bad apples," it was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy that has dismantled those wise constraints and has made war on America's checks and balances.    Let us return to the taste of that hyperbole soup. Here is what Al Gore is saying. First, George W. Bush has destroyed the essential checks and balances of our Constitution. How, exactly, Gore does not say. But Gore is quite sure that the misconduct at Abu Ghraib is the natural result of the Bush administration's war on those checks and balances. So, would Gore have been happier if Congress had passed a resolution supporting the embarrasment and humiliation of imprisoned Iraqi militia? Of course not. The whole idea, from top to bottom, is utterly silly.   The abuse of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib flowed directly from the abuse of the truth that characterized the Administration's march to war and the abuse of the trust that had been placed in President Bush by the American people in the aftermath of September 11th.    At least he seems to have forgotten about Florida.    There was then, there is now and there would have been regardless of what Bush did, a threat of terrorism that we would have to deal with. But instead of making it better, he has made it infinitely worse. We are less safe because of his policies. He has created more anger and righteous indignation against us as Americans than any leader of our country in the 228 years of our existence as a nation -- because of his attitude of contempt for any person, institution or nation who disagrees with him.    Contempt for nations opposing freedom? Or contempt for nations attempting to maintain a multi-billion dollar scheme of money laundering at the expense of oppressed peoples? He does not say.    He has exposed Americans abroad and Americans in every U.S. town and city to a greater danger of attack by terrorists because of his arrogance, willfulness, and bungling at stirring up hornet's nests that pose no threat whatsoever to us. And by then insulting the religion and culture and tradition of people in other countries. And by pursuing policies that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children, all of it done in our name.    Stirring up hornets is, all things equal, a bad thing. However, the hornets who attacked us on September 11, 2001 were not stirred. Unless, of course, the Clinton administration had stirred them, but Clinton was painfully inadequate in his dealings with terrorist threats. The hornets, unstirred, attacked and killed nearly 3,000 people. These must be the hornets Al Gore believes "pose no threat whatsoever to us."  I would like to know how many men, women and children we have killed in our unbridled hornet stirring, and how many men, women and children were killed, annually, by Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. The numbers, if we are forced to play a numbers game, are not equal. A recent estimate was that 80,000 people died annually in Iraq under Hussein directly from the regime. American action has saved countless lives.   The war plan was incompetent in its rejection of the advice from military professionals and the analysis of the intelligence was incompetent in its conclusion that our soldiers would be welcomed with garlands of flowers and cheering crowds. Thus we would not need to respect the so-called Powell doctrine of overwhelming force.   Pick and choose your Iraq news, Mr. Gore, for it is the only way to substantiate your doom and gloom synopsis. The "so-called" Powell doctrine? Is there another name for it? Is it not really a doctrine, or not accredited to Powell?   What a disgrace that their families have to hold bake sales to buy discarded Kevlar vests to stuff into the floorboards of the Humvees! Bake sales for body armor.    Let's set aside our concerns with veracity for a brief moment. Hasn't this been a staple bumper sticker for liberals for nearly twenty years now?    Noting that Vietnam featured a pattern of winning battles while losing the war, Hughes added "unless we ensure that we have coherence in our policy, we will lose strategically."    I hope Al Gore got clearance from John F. Kerry about using Vietnam in his speech...   But amazingly, even active duty military officers are speaking out against President Bush. For example, the Washington Post quoted an unnamed senior General at the Pentagon as saying, " the current OSD (Office of the Secretary of Defense) refused to listen or adhere to military advice." Rarely if ever in American history have uniformed commanders felt compelled to challenge their commander in chief in public   They haven't - it was an  anonymous  source.    And as a direct result of this incompetent plan and inadequate troop strength, young soldiers were put in an untenable position. For example, young reservists assigned to the Iraqi prisons were called up without training or adequate supervision, and were instructed by their superiors to "break down" prisoners in order to prepare them for interrogation.    I thought it was because of Bush's single-handed destruction of the checks and balances of the Constitution.   Okay - that's all I can stomach. There's still more than 2/3 of the speech left. God help us that more than this man's family supports him. Which, according to Al Gore, for us conservatives must be the devil.

      For days, I've been trying to figure out the latest poll numbers on the economy. Over half the people believe the economy is getting worse, despite record growth, plummeting unemployment, and still-low interest rates. The only thing I could point to in order to explain this level of opinion was the high gas prices, which are more visible, and more concrete, than the other indicators. All this pondering, of course, was done in a political light, in an effort to determine what factors would affect voting patterns in the upcoming election.  It's possible my pondering may be moot. According to this USA Today article, only  urlLink 5% blame Bush  for high gas prices. Does this mean that the economy issue this election is going to be a wash? Any thoughts? Is an average economy sufficient to guarantee Bush reelection?

      The topic is generally not framed in such a way, but in all honesty, will always boil down to these two options. Either the Arab world can or cannot produce vibrant, functional democracies. Being the eternal optimist, firmly planted in the plains of reality, I offer that democracy can and will grow in the Middle East. The ultimate caveat, is, of course, that conditions must be right.  Instapundit notes a recent  urlLink debate  on the topic. When I speak of the right conditions for the growth of Arab democracy, I think in terms of who will see it through. The experiment here in America, Europe, and Asia has flourished only after complete societal upheaval. There are various degrees of societal change in each example, but in none was the process easy, smooth and quick. America suffered a horrible economic collapse after a painful and bloody revolution, emerging victorious and democratic only after the most powerful military on earth had been defeated. In the UK, the process was more gradual, but there had been numberous battles over the years, from the cornering of King John, to the effects of Cromwell and the Interregnum, to get to the current parliamentary system now functioning. Germany and Japan were both obliterated, spiritually and physically, before becoming democractic. Eastern Europe's fledgling democracies emerged from over forty years of oppressive, totalitarian rule, and are just now finding their footing.   My point, and it is an unfortunate one, is that there must be some sort of complete upheaval in the Middle East, whether governmental or societal, before democracy can exist. In other words, the people must sacrifice and brave death, or the current ruling classes must somehow be removed. Anything short of this would be an historical first. This is not to say that democratic change could not happen in a peaceful way, but the worst possible result would be democracy-in-name-only, where oligarchs and those in positions of influence manipulated the new system for their own gain. This happened some in Eastern Europe after the fall. The worst of the perpetrators, such as Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia, were quickly (i.e. within five years or so) dispatched.    Hmm...an add-on point. We've been in Iraq a little over a year. The country is largely intact. Is it at all appropriate that the United States be given a little slack here? I guess the answer to that depends on how much of a partisan you are.

      with a twelve gauge shotgun. That's the closest metaphor I can come up with to describe Andrew Sullivan's  urlLink Fisking  of the most recent Susan Sontag drivel.   I need not go into much detail myself. Sullivan does an expert job of pointing out the intellectual inconsistency and dishonesty of Sontag. If she were nearly as intelligent as she and those of her ilk would like us to believe, such inconsistencies would never surface. But when one spits upon their oath as an academic, preferring to pay only lip service to the seeking of truth, and instead chooses to promote ideological uniformity and revel in juvenile self-praise, one should expect no less.  Anytime Sontag publishes, I'm giving Andrew Sullivan the ink-loaded shotgun.

      The debate, er, concerning debates, and who should participate in them, is a  urlLink recurrent feature  of the American political cycle. More than most countries, America is hardwired as a two-party political system. Over our history those two parties have changed somewhat (remember the Federalists? the Whigs? and more confusingly in today's terms, the Democratic Republicans?), but the system has typically operated with two actors, random occurences and insufficiently popular populist movements not withstanding.  It is a fact of American political life that, on the ideological fringes, other parties do exist. Some are mere intellectual clubs, with minimal party structure (the Libertarians), while some are, dare we say, intellectually lacking, with some semblance of a party structure (the Greens).  The question is whether these parties actually add anything to the American political discourse. It pains me to say this, as I tend to have domestic libertarian tendencies, but the answer is a resounding "No." This is why.  Unlike some national political landscapes, America has functioned for her entire history under the big-tent, two party construct. Today the Democrats tend to occupy the center/left, and the Republicans tend to occupy the center/right. Within each party is a myriad of participants, candidates, and opinions. The parties are multi-issue in nature, and allow for limited dissent from the party line on an issue by issue basis. This political structure actually allows for more of a mixture of opinions, and requires candidates to be multi-faceted. In contrast, third party candidates tend to be single-issue driven, or driven by a very narrow agenda on the ideological fringe of the American electorate. The two-party system allows those who have a primary focus or personal issue to join the fold, but requires of its candidates more depth to increase their electoral appeal. Third parties, and specifically, single issue parties, by definition offer up inferior candidates who are over-focused on a limited set of issues. Either that or the party is so far on the fringe that it is, by definition, unelectable on a national or statewide level.   Candidates with unelectable party affiliations should not muddy the waters between two viable candidates. I'll take the Nader-effect, as we had in 2000, because it's just desserts for the Perot effect in 1992. But in general, we'd all be better off if We the People did not have our electoral will thwarted and elections thrown because of fringe candidacies.   Debates are designed to exhibit the candidates, their differences, and their fitness for office. They are not held to provide a soapbox to the ideologically and organizationally challenged.

I think those are sufficient disclaimers - caveat emptor to all who read this blog. I promise not to be too terribly partisan. I see no need to be so.

      All coverage seems very respectful. The exceptions are as follows: BBC's story is horribly slanted. Second, locally, WSMV, the NBC affiliate in Nashville, did NOT cut from Arena Football to cover anything. There was a short blurb from Brian Williams referring viewers to the 10pm news broadcast for more details. Perhaps he should have referred viewers to any other channel.   Disgusting.

      Opinion Journal has a great  urlLink article  by one of the Tainanmen Square protest leaders, Wuer Kaixi. It seems that the events there have largely faded from the geopolitical consciousness.   The Chinese government that now exists is the heir and continuation of the most efficient, widespread, gargantuan murder machine in the history of the world. We sidestep the issue repeatedly, preferring Chinese cheap labor and the promises of their east coast as a ripe market for Western goods and services. It disgusts me. How can we condemn Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and Communist Russia, but sit back and ignore the atrocities and evils of Communist China? The other evil bohemoths have been defeated and cease to exist. The Chinese government still oppresses one fifth of the world's people.  The communist government of China is the same one in the late 1950's and 1960's that wanted to lure American forces onto the Chinese mainland to nuke them. This is the same China that lobs missiles over Taiwan on a regular basis. This is the same China that refuses to allow democratic elections. Indeed, no freedom truly exists. Political jailings, rapes, and killings are widespread. The nation of China is not truly a nation. It is a conglomeration of peoples that have been subjugated, similar to the nations that fell under the Soviet Union's umbrella and the satellites of Eastern Europe.   If we can't take them on directly, fine. But let's not ignore the obvious. The people under the yoke of Chinese communism are no less deserving of a free life than we in the West.

      I haven't written anything about the downturn in President Reagan's condition. The reason is this: I'm not sure what to say. One of the greatest Americans in history has suffered a long and unfitting end to a brilliant life. We all knew that this time would come. But somewhere, deep down, I've always felt more comfortable about the light of American freedom knowing the Gipper was still with us.   He is still with us, in some sense. But the twilight is upon us. As he wrote in 1994, announcing his diagnosis of Alzheimers    I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead.  I guess that's the answer I need.

      I am glad to see, despite his microlevel speaking issues, that George W. Bush is quite good in the delivery of soaring rhetoric. His speech at Colorado Springs was awesome, as well as his press conference with Silvio Berlusconi. In fact, all his speeches focused on freedom and the ongoing war have been exceptional. This, quite frankly, seems to be because those are subjects he has deep, unwavering convictions about, and he is not an actor, whether that be in the Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton vein. At once it was thought a liability - I believe it to be his greatest strength.  I am curious as to the content of the D-Day address. Oh, how upset will the French be at the inevitable comparison of D-Day and the liberation of Europe and the liberation of Iraq and Afghanistan! It's apt, and accurate, and needs to be said. The French are defensive because they are ashamed - ashamed that their current geopolitical status and desire for future French hegemony (unrealistic as that is) requires a dangerous forgetfulness. They feel the comparison is somehow, I detect, unfair. To be such self-styled sophisticates, it amazes one to consider how childish the French elite view of the world actually has become. The French have always had an overinflated view of their self-importance, but never to the point of such self-destructive behavior.   Of course, the French world, and view of it, is much different now than it was twenty, or even ten, years ago. It was almost instantly begrudging, but the French relationship with the United States after World War II existed positively for very high-states reasons. There was some French intransigence and free-riding, such as de Gaulles' pullout from the military arm of NATO, and the refusal to allow Allied use of air space in the bombing of Libya, but there was little doubt as to where allegiances ultimately lied. This is no longer the case.  Since the end of the Cold War, the French have turned their attention to more local matters. The rise in influence of the European Union has changed the French goal. No longer is the nation concerned with liberty outside its borders and attacks from without. It has found a way to minimize the size of its operative world, and to once again hold sway over the path of the continent where it had seen its influence and power eroded for most of the last one hundred years. This is an unfortunate limitation, for a culture that has played so significantly in the history of Western Civilization.  France has attempted to shrink its world and remove the one factor of being a nation-state it has been dismal at in modern times - military proficiency. America's presence, especially on the anniversary of D-Day, on French soil, reminds the French political aristocracy of this fact - that in the real world outside their overly bloated EU bubble that they are the poster child of impotence and uselessness. Denial is the enemy of true progress.  Let George W. Bush remind them of this fact.

      Just now catching the Soros speech from Thursday. I feel like some real-time, C-SPAN delated fisking. It's unfortunate, both for George Soros and the crowd. He claims we don't care about the Iraqi people because we didn't send in enough troops...interesting assessment, that wouldn't get applause for any other speaker in front of this same group of naive, self-righteous, American hating stooges.  Of course, he said it, then followed that we are responsible for the ransacking of Iraqi museums.  I really liked George Soros before this. Currency trader extraordinate - geopolitical knave. His simile, that the bubble of the 1990s is apropos to the Bush administration's policies today, is disingenuous. His argument, it seems, is essentially that stability should be achieved above all else.  Accordingly, the bubbles are self-correcting. If that is the case, intellectual consistency requires one not being too worried about Bush.  Policies will self-correct.  Oh, so we've been deceived, and have embarked on a policy in which we cannot succeed...I suppose nukes's in NYC and sarin in San Francisco would be preferred to attempting to succeed.    Stifling of dissent? Really? Ashcroft passed the Patriot Act? Congress? Senate? Democrats? Anybody? Bueller???  Abu Ghraib is the moment of truth. Of course, as he then says, that is not what this nation stands for. Very true. Now is where he compares Abu Ghraib to 9/11.   The war on terror has claimed more innocents than 9/11??? Oh my - complete sillines, Soros. How many people did the Taliban and Hussein kill annually...that seems not to be considered, at all. It's a net number, not a gross, one-sided number. Soros knows better. He understands finance, which means he understands basic math.  Very unfortunate.  Now he's arguing that we are pushing Iraq towards civil war because we're not killing enough of the resistance. No response from the crowd. Only because Bush is scared of too many US casualties.  Iraq has been an utter disaster. Our military power has diminished? The Hussein government fell in a matter of weeks.   Ah, there it goes - our standing in the world is damaged. Predictable.   And now he calls for American regime change. Democracy is now disfavored by Soros and the haters, apparently.    Key No Applause Line - "The United States is the most powerful nation on earth."  I can take no more.

      The "Choose Life" Tennessee license plate has made  urlLink national news . But is it really unconstitutional? And if it really is, why hasn't the ACLU gone after George Michael and VH1 Classic for pushing the same horrific message?  For those who do not know, the Tennessee General Assembly has adopted production of a pro-life license plate, but rejected authorization of a pro-choice plate. In effect, the legislature of Tennessee is making a political statement. It has made such a positivee statement on myriad plates, from jazz in Memphis to Lake Radnor to Vanderbilt University. So what's the problem? What are legislatures supposed to do, but make political statements?  Should the pro-choice lobby (I really hate that term - I'm going to do to them what they do to the term "pro-life"), er, the anti-life lobby, be angry that they didn't get a plate? Of course! The proper remedy is to get more anti-life members elected to the legislature, not go whine in federal court that life is "unfair."  I'm going to go read the ACLU complaint now.

There were actually a bunch of faded Dean stickers around, though. Unsurprising revelation  - did not see a single Bush/Cheney sticker.

If there were an American political polar opposite to Ronald Reagan, it would be Bill Clinton. It is entirely appropriate that he not speak at the service if Nancy Reagan requests he not. The whine about a state funeral being funded by public money is the basest of claims that Bill Clinton should be allowed to speak. Someone should tell Bill Clinton he is no longer employed by the federal government (at least, we don't think he is).

      From the blog in Forsythe Park in downtown Savannah:   Bret called from Forsyth at 9:56 a.m.  The opening parade is a bit of a joke. There are about 12 protesters wearing black scarves over their faces carrying signs. There are probably 100 media, photographers and reporters.  The organizers shortened the parade route. Instead of going to the Civil Rights Museum on MLK, they are staying in Forsyth.  Meanwhile, on Reynolds Square, a small group of protesters are putting up signs while surrounded by National Guardsmen.    This is all called a "nonstory."    So, here's a lesson. Do all global events in the South. The protesters know intrinsically that, generally speaking, if you get rambunctuous in Seattle, or out in California, the police will be gentle and slow to resort to force. I don't think the guardsmen and police in Savannah and Brunswick will have that same patience.

Hopefully they were able to go buy a Coke to cool off...  This typo by the Savannah Morning News is entertaining:   Bennett was also bothered by activists displaying large photos from the Iraq war and from the Glynn County prison scandal.

      Since I grew up in Savannah, I'm watching with great interest how the G8 Summit unfolds. What everyone probably does not know is that Sea Island is a good distance from Savannah. Sea Island is right next to St. Simon's Island, near Jekyll Island, both of which are off the coast near Brunswick. Sea Island, if done in a straight shot, is probably a 90 minute drive from Savannah. Savannah seems to be the preferred place of activity over, say, Brunswick which is much smaller with less hotel capacity, or Jacksonville, which is just as close, which is not nearly as much fun. The G8 have essentially commandeered the entire Coastal Empire.  My parents have noted the build of quick fences around government buildings downtown, as well surface-to-air missile batteries along the river downtown. I would suggest the protesters not rent a helicopter.  The largest protest thus far has been  urlLink thirty , that's right, thirty people and that was in Brunswick, about an hour south.  Unworthy of news coverage, one would think. But the Savannah Morning News gives the soapbox to the self-proclaimed "leader" of the protest.  Just heard on Fox News that the "free speech zone" is on what amounts to a built-up island sand bar across the Savannah River. I just hope they leave the convention center alone...  I'm a little protective. Savannah is one of the most beautiful cities in the country, if not the world. A bunch of prepubescently mature angry children need not trash it. Where do they get the idea that they have more credibility on chaos and destruction than William T. Sherman, anyhow?

I'll be practicing in four different areas of law today - fun for the entire jurisprudential family. Throw a nonprofit meeting on top of that, and you've got a full day.  But as a quick aside, before I head out the door to court, I would be remiss in not noting that the passing of President Reagan is finally settling in. The truth is that sadness is not what the Gipper would have wanted. Reagan's trademark eternal optimisim requires otherwise.   People grieve and will view the procession of the next week in a variety of ways through a myriad of emotional perspectives. At least on Friday, I will likely shed a tear or two for the physical loss of a great man. But his spirit lives on through all of us who believe in the power of freedom and the ultimate triumph of those who are free. He defined my generation, greatly influenced those before, and will forever have touched those to come. When you think about it, it's hard not to be joyous. Ronald Reagan was given his time on this earth, and made the absolute most of it. I am thankful.

      I've finally decided what this comes down to -  urlLink liberals  just hate market forces. The market has told them they are not wanted, and they are having a hard time swallowing the cold, hard truth of rejection.  This has been discussed by many, but in the short of it, if you have to buy an infomercial (which is essentially what Air America is, then you are attempting to act above and around market forces. Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity pay no one to air their respective shows - people pay them. That's what's causing liberal skin to crawl all throughout the Air America broadcast zone (which covers the bulk of the mighty island of Manhattan). In fact, they are  not  wanted, and it hurts their pride.  It's ok - they still have all the networks and wire services, plus some cable. They aren't too bad off. It's just the message they propogate.

      I lost a lot of confidence in the FAA re 9/11 today, listening to the testimony before the 9/11 Commission. Things have changed, as in there is definitely protocol for decision-making if a similar situation ever arises.   The "analysis paralysis" MO of the FAA in Washington on 9/11 was alarming. When asked whether fighters should be scrambled to intercept UA93, the individual in Washington stammered, hemmed and hawed, which is most alarming with reports there was a bomb on board UA93 and there had already been three attacks by this point. Fortunately, fighters were already in the air after the attack on the Pentagon, so there would have been opportunity to defend the capital if need be. Though the standing order was not to shoot, this order could have been changed in seconds.

      Okay, I guess  urlLink this  shouldn't surprise me, but Bill Clinton has stated to Dan Rather that he wears his impeachment as a "badge of honor."  He somehow concludes that the impeachment vote was an abuse of power. I guess the majority voting for conviction in the Senate are equally as guilty.  The president lies under oath and obstructs justice, and it's not his fault. The sociopathic tendencies of this ex-president remain strong. It would be more prejudicial than probative to compare him to other, more substantive, former presidents.

The true measure of a free people is unbridled commerce. The freedom to retain the profits of one's labor is a prerequisite for a stable and free society. A free market economy in Iraq is the surest way to stability and modernization.   Foreign direct investment will be a key indicator as to how Iraq is actually doing. Capital will not flow into an unstable environment. If FDI is high and growing, the immediate future for Iraq will be bright.

Paternalism is not the chief role of the state, and the state functions better when it limits its scope.

If people are willing to forego the seat belt, they will have to live with the consequences.

The biggest deadweight appears to be captained by California, which has a 6.2% unemployment rate. Since California is a Republican gift if it happens, but hardly a guarantee, that should cause the GOP minimal concern.   For the sake of personal pride, Tennessee currently has a 4.9% unemployment rate, while my longtime home of Georgia is riding high at 3.8%. Want a job? Come to the South!

       urlLink Naturally , Max Cleland lost because those dumb voters in Georgia were tricked by the evil Republicans questioning the former senator's patriotism. From the AP:   Cleland, who lost both legs and an arm as an Army captain during the Vietnam War, lost his re-election bid in a bitter campaign against then-Rep. Saxby Chambliss.  The GOP had raised questions about Cleland's patriotism because of his position on legislation to create the Department of Homeland Security.  Cleland supported the concept behind the department, but insisted that a workers' rights provision be part of the bill.    At least it has been admitted, and the standard is clear. Challenging a senator's vote on a piece of legislation is sufficient to amount to a challenge of that senator's patriotism.

      There are few things in the battle of ideas that makes me more gleeful than to find an opponent who has managed to wedge itself into such a position that the only means of escape would require it to gnaw off its own journalistic credibility.  For instance, the LA Times trying to explain their  urlLink poll  showing Kerry trouncing Bush nationally fits this category. It now appears that their much-ballyhooed poll consisted of a sample containing 38% Democrats and 25% Republicans. Who would have thought, with that sampling, that Kerry would enjoy a 7% lead?  So, here's the rub. Was the LA Times guilty of bad polling (it already was a registered voter poll, which is typically skewed left) or intentional bias? My first reaction, of course, is bias. Whether intentional or institutional (it is possible that the LA Times believes nationwide that Republicans are that outnumbered by Democrats), the results are intolerable. Publishing a poll like this in the most circulated daily in the state certainly could affect the outcome in California, which, surprisingly, is not yet completely in Kerry's bag.  Then again, incompetence is not all that farfetched. We are talking of an industry where the most elite of journalistic sources have published news stories that have been completely fabricated. Journalists operated unchecked, and were allowed to repeatedly author falsehoods and manipulate public opinion by laptop. In short, monkeys on crack would have at least had the inclination to crumple up some of the false stories and throw them back at their authors.   So, LA Times, which is it?

      The suit attempting to remove "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance has been halted on standing grounds. This is where I thought it should have stopped originally anyhow - the Ninth Circuit held true to form, though, making sure that no Constitutional requirements got in their way of making Constitutional law.  The reason the Newdow suit even came to me was that he was just now on FNC. I presume his standing fell because he did not have custody of his daughter. It's possible that he isn't even a legal guardian anymore (I beg for advance forgiveness, as family law is not my forte). Point is, he mentioned how disturbing the custody laws are in this country, how they "rip families apart," etc. That begs the question, of course: Is he concerned about custody laws because they muffed up his suit, or does he really want to spend more time around his daughter?   Varying motives make for interesting speculation.

      There is a  urlLink politically correct  effort afoot in Congress to prevent the US Army from using Israeli made bullets in combat in the Middle East.   In short, this is silly, and quite frankly, could only be thought of by one of the myriad clueless lawmakers out of the 435 members of Congress. Bullets are typically used to, well, shudder the thought, Congressman Abercrombie (and the tag-along Republicans on this one), kill people. If we're to kill them, what worth is it to try to avoid offending them? Maybe the Israeli bullets will make Islamist militants spontaneously combust and easier to kill.  The argument states a public relations concern with the greater population of the Middle East if word gets out we're using infidel bullets. There may be some validity in that perspective, but overall, it simply feeds into an irrational and hateful attitude held by way too many in the region. The people must get over their anti-Semitic attitudes. We don't tolerate the least hint of racism in the United States, and the worst way it manifests itself now is in parades where there are more protesters than participants, and in a worse case scenario, one loses their job for racial reasons. The former is sad, the latter is actionable under federal and state law.   In the Middle East, racism results in death. And not just a little death, but a lot of death. Hamas and Hezbollah have stated aims of killing every Jew in Israel (a little over 6 million). In contrast, the racist organizations in the United States have to cloak their prejudice in symbolic language, and none I can think of nowadays advocate killing minorities. Still, those groups are roundly condemned and ostracized from mainstream society.  Racially based death is a mainstream opinion in the Arab world. Why the double standard? The Middle Eastern culture as it currently stands is, in fact, backwards. It is frozen in time, and has no future. The only future it does have, short of Allied involvement, is that of oppression, dictatorship, death, and destruction. We ought not cater to those peoples whose beliefs fuel this backwardness.

When Congress met to count the electoral votes, the dispute over Florida's electors would likely have been challenged by Democrats in Congress, resulting in the House choosing the president by a majority vote of the state delegations (the Senate would choose the vice president). Twenty-seven of the House delegations were majority Republican, meaning Bush would have been elected by the House under any scenario.

He will charge that Bush and Cheney have "institutionalized dishonesty as an essential element of their policy process."   Gore will also urge the broadcast media to further resist Administration efforts to manipulate and intimidate them, to fearlessly report the fact that there is no Al Qaeda/Saddam collaborative relationship, as the 9/11 Commission staff report has concluded.   Gore will also discuss the implications of the Administration's claim to be above the law in ordering the torture of suspects - and their claim that the Commander in Chief's power trumps all other laws. He will call for the Administration to reveal all orders given the military on the treatment of prisoners.    Shouldn't he just go away?

      Teddy bears have taken a new  urlLink twist .  "Bush Kills Arabs Dead", it says. And this is a true statement. Arabs supporting fanatic Islam and threatening the West have, in fact, been "killed dead". Is this a bad thing? Was killing soldiers fighting for Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan a bad thing?

      It appears that the Iranian government intends to fully  urlLink persecute  the 8 British sailors captured yesterday.   Outside of the UK government, I am apparently one of the only people on earth watching this so carefully. Maybe I read the opinion of the UK public wrong. Perhaps they don't care much that Iran has confiscated three boats and eight sailors, where a warning would have sufficed. I hope that is not the case.

      Local press coverage  urlLink finally  gets around to it. The Davidson County Election Commission (which is the county of Metropolitan Nashville) has had the gauntlet thrown. And the Democrats on the commission are most unhappy about it.  A short summary of some of the problems with the voter rolls here in Davidson County -    Nearly 8,000 didn't vote in the last decade but remain on the active list, which had 303,000 voters as of May, he said. One person hadn't voted in 34 years, he said, but had repeatedly asked for duplicate voter registration cards.   and this   Almost 40,000 voters classified as active have not voted or updated their registration records for two consecutive November elections, he said. They, too, should be moved to inactive status, he said.   and finally,   He also said 300 people were added to the county's voter rolls for the 2000 presidential election, even though they filed after the registration deadline.   Chairwoman Betty Nixon, a Democrat, is more unhappy with the presentation of the problem by Lynn Greer, a Republican, than with the substance of the problem (though she does give some lip service to it). Of course, that has been the problem, that no one made any noise about there being a problem. Now that the Republicans, who control nothing on the commission, are making waves, the Democracts are reeling.   This is the county where ballot boxes have been found in allegedly secure warehouses days after an election, where streets have been paved on election eve night to garner votes, and where, on occasion, more votes were counted in a precinct than voters existed in that precinct. It's nigh time the Repubs take a stand and demand accountability.   And The Tennessean, in fine journalistic fashion, erroneously calls Sharon Wood, a friend of mine and a Republican working in the election commission who has been persecuted in her position, Sandra Wood. Nice.

      One small step for commercial suborbital flight,  urlLink one giant leap  for the infusion of capitalism into space travel.  I am glad to see SpaceShipOne work in such a heavily publicized trial-run. This is one case where the symbolism is certainly greater than the substance. The technology is not all that earth shattering. Scaled Composites has designed a hybrid fueling system for the ship, which is more stable chemically and greatly eases the need for expensive and complex refueling procedures.  The truly earth shattering aspect of this flight is the breaking of a government monopoly on human space travel. The benefits of such a breakthrough are impossible to minimalize, though many will try.

The British people have, to put in the best possible light, been on the fence, undecided, and at times (to include now), completely hostile, to UK involvement in Iraq.

      Private  urlLink spaceflight  is the key to the further expansion and exploration of our humanity. From the beginning of history, our species has had an insatiable desire to explore. Pioneerism is innate in us and has suffered a setback by regulation as of late. Government is no longer a prerequisite for successful space flight, and stands in the way of the potential exploitation of Space for the benefit of mankind.  Initially, space flight was too capital intensive and too risky for anyone but a government entity to embark upon it. Now, the situation is different. The science required to get into orbit is now general knowledge. Mistakes have been made, and risks can now be properly assessed. We should encourage private space flight - perhaps tax credits are in order...

      And yes, they know what is best for you,  urlLink too .  Germany, who, understandably, is hesitant when it comes to state run executions, has called on Iraq to, in a summary of words, be more democratic and re-abolish the death penalty.  Okay, when did Germany have anything to do with Iraq? Who are these people again? Let's refer to a nation that actually had more of an impact than Germany in freeing Iraq, Latvia   Latvian Foreign Ministry spokesman Rets Plesums said that whatever happens to Saddam after his trial is a matter of concern for Iraq  not the Baltic state.   "We are hoping that the new Iraqi courts will conduct the trial as fairly as possible, but I don't think our government will offer an opinion about what happens to Saddam Hussein," he said. "It's not our business."    Latvia, a recent newcomer also to NATO (news - web sites), ardently backed the U.S.-led invasion and contributed more than 100 soldiers to the coalition after fighting ended last year.   At least Latvia sent troops, and still understands the need for self-determination (so odd, that only the former communist counties seem to fully grasp such things).  Oh wait, and then there's Poland   Poland, another supporter of the war, offered a similar view. Poland just decided to extend its troop deployment of 2,400 soldiers in Iraq until Dec. 31.   "Our reaction is obvious. This is a sovereign decision of an independent court and of the Iraqis themselves," said Boguslaw Majewski, spokesman for Poland's Foreign Ministry.    They sent troops too, and are currently responsible for security in a southern district in Iraq.   Germany and France - no one needs them.

      Jarvis and  urlLink Instapundit  are, I think, jumping overboard on  urlLink this .  As someone who has been involved in efforts both political and nonpolitical involving volunteers, there's no substitute for additional paid help.  You augment your efforts with paid help - you don't replace your volunteers with paid help. Both the political parties do it. The Dems just have a longer history of it. Anyone who has worked with volunteers in anything understand the different problems that arise that cannot be remedied with paid help. If you're paying someone, the threat of termination is always there. If they're working for free, well, you can't just fire them. They'll find something else to work on, because what they're doing is not their job.  Just like taxes - if you want to pay more of your money to the government, no one is stopping you.

The focus on larger employers misses the vast majority of the economy, and does not reflect the individualism enabled by various advents in technology and the emergence of small business servicing firms.

      Jacob Levy seems to be close to  urlLink abandoning  George W. Bush.  Being a rather logical fellow in most instances, this approach by Levy flusters me. An excerpt   I know a lot of Libertarians are leaning Democratic this year because they oppose the Iraq War. I'm leaning that way in part because I supported it, and thought it was a truly important project. Some combination, or some complicated interaction, of terrible incompetence; an absolute prioritization of political over policy considerations; and a serious contempt for outside, contrary, disinterested, or expert opinion have made a serious mess of Iraq, trade policy, fiscal policy, and much else besides.    The enemy of excellence is perfection.  Certainly, as we operate in a two-party system, one must take the good with the bad when voting for a major party candidate. To vote for anyone other than a major party candidate is to throw the election through inaction, and is not affirmatively helping to decide the outcome.   The truth is, in a historic perspective, Iraq is not a mess. If political considerations were tantamount to Bush, he would never have gone into Iraq to begin with. He has staked his entire presidency on the war in Iraq. A huge gamble, to be sure, and largely an unnecessary one. Levy's preference to a more intellectual administration is, whether he believes it to be or not, a pining for the return of a Clintonesque set of policies and policy decision-making, where analysis was preferred over decisive action, and where paralysis set in where decisive action was required.  I'm not happy with the steel tariffs either, which amounted to nothing more than a cheap political ploy. But once again, perfection is not the goal. The foreign policy is working. It's just not pretty while in process.

Four percent of the world's shipping goes through the canal. It sounds like a small number, but the economic ripple effect would be felt worldwide.

      I think we should just go ahead with it - put a multi-pointy little hat on the man with the respective number of bells, dress him up in a jumpsuit adorned with all sorts of bright colors, hammers, sickles, and the like, and send him on the next Osmond tour.  That's how serious Paul Krugman actually deserves to be treated. But here in the blogosphere, serious discourse must rule the day.   The latest Krugman column is  urlLink here  (link requires registration). The former Enron advisor purports to tell us all how we lost Iraq.  Lost Iraq?     figures on insurgent attacks and civilian casualties show a security situation that got progressively worse, not better;   Yes, see, Saddam Hussein was better because he provided "security." And, oh my, there is more   Defenders of the administration will no doubt say that Christian Aid and other critics have no proof that the unaccounted-for billions were ill spent. But think of it this way: given the Arab world's suspicion that we came to steal Iraq's oil, the occupation authorities had every incentive to expedite an independent audit that would clear Halliburton and other U.S. corporations of charges that they were profiteering at Iraq's expense. Unless, that is, the charges are true.   Ahh...Halliburton, profiteering, bad, feeling feverish, no longer coherent...I think it was your theory, Mr. Krugman, along with the rest of the far left, that we were there only for the oil. But since we didn't actually take the oil, Halliburton must be profiteering. In no way is it possible that NONE OF THIS IS HAPPENING! On the heels of the fact that none of this is happening, Krugman is simply more convinced that it is.   The Iraqis didn't get any benefit from the oil anyhow before we got there. Thanks to Saddam Hussein, the United Nations, and Russian, German and French "cronies", to borrow a moniker so casually thrown about, billions of dollars of oil revenues earmarked to feed the Iraqi people never got there.  To put things in perspective, check out my post below on the successes and progress in Iraq relative to other rebuilding projects the American democracy machine has undertaken. Of course, I'm sure someone made money in Germany in 1945, too. Maybe Krugman will write a scathing column about Harry Truman and his friends in Missouri soon.   UPDATE  urlLink Halliburton  shows its favor with the Bush administration by losing money.

      For those who are, well, educated about the past, it is plain on the face of things that the handover and rebuilding of Iraq is going exceptionally well. Anytime one attempts to recusitate a grayed and dying civilization from the depths of tyrannical rule, roadblocks, complications, and resistance from those who were once in power are always going to occur.  Our nearest temporal example to such an effort is the occupation, rebuilding, and establishment of democratic systems in Japan and Germany post-World War II.  The transition there was extraordinarily difficult.  The fact is, the infrastructure in Iraq is now better than it was when Iraq was ruled by Saddam Hussein, the economy exists and is growing, the schools are reopened, and the people are, most importantly, free.    Here is what the United States has done. The Baathist government of Iraq collapsed within three weeks of the American invasion, and have managed to pull together an Iraqi civilian government and transfer power to that government, all within 14 months of invasion, with a total casualty count of just over 1000, most of which occurred after victory in the war.  This is one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of mankind and modern warfare. To minimalize it, to even, in some extremes, to mock it, is to trivialize a great accomplishment and to show a certain flair for the assinine.    urlLink More  is discussed here.

      It seems that Jacques Chirac has  urlLink select undergarments  of his in a wad   Chirac said on Monday that Bush should not comment on Turkey's EU entry hopes as EU affairs were none of his business.  "If President Bush really said that the way I read it, well, not only did he go too far but he went into a domain which is not his own," Chirac told reporters at the summit.  "It is like me trying to tell the United States how it should manage its relations with Mexico," he added.   Ahh, the French.  It's still so cute - they think they actually have influence as far away as Mexico. The French government is lucky to have influence outside France.   The difference, of course, between reality and Jacques Chirac is that the United States does in fact have influence in Europe, and especially in Eastern Europe. If the French weren't such xenophobes, the thought of Turkey entering the EU would not be all that extreme an idea, and Chirac would not have his  slip  in a wad. What makes the French position all the more absurd is that the other major members of the EU, to include the UK and Germany, are for Turkish inclusion in the union.

I just got around to reading the opinion today, but have not yet read the dissents. I, along with thousands of other criminal attorneys, are rethinking some strategies in relation to our state sentencing guildines. Tennessee is one of the states that will indeed feel the effects of  Blakely .   In a nutshell, judges can no longer enhance sentences on facts not found by a jury. How this applies to sentencing hearings is not quite clear, but seems to require a jury to determine the existence of enhancing factors unless the jury is waived by the defendant.  In the majority opinion, Scalia did confirm that defendants could waive the jury aspect to sentencing, just as they can opt for a bench trial. In short, it adds additional chips to the plea bargain process and in the end will be good for defendants, and shift the burden more to the state (where it belongs, and where too often judges tend to attempt to shift the burden back to the defendant). Additionally, all findings of fact relating to sentence enhancement must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. Indictments will be affected as well.   I will blog more on the subject as the practical effects of  Blakely  become clearer.

Your plague is not just greed, but greed that compels you to create even more loss. Your greed is destructive, a byproduct of our entitlement culture. If the stakes weren't so high for those involved you could be easily dismissed as nothing more than an immature adult, wanting to have his way. Instead, your actions could destroy an institution, at fault for simply existing, for no other purpose than your pecuniary gain.  Your desire for relief from anyone but the shooter is selfish and foolish.   Needless to say, I share your former friends' and professors' disdain.

Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack and kill our service members during the war, and is still doing so. Syria continues to provide safe haven and political cover to Hizballah in Lebanon, which has killed hundreds of Americans in the past. Statements from many of Syrias public officials during this time vilified the Coalitions motives in seeking to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Indeed, the United States portrayed as an enemy is a consistent theme found in newspapers and public statements in Syria as it is in other states in the region. Although Damascus has increased its cooperation regarding Iraq since the fall of the Iraqi regime, its behavior during Operation Iraqi Freedom underscores the importance of taking seriously reports and information on Syrias WMD capabilities.

And Saddam demonstrated his willingness to use such weapons: Iraqi troops have employed poison gas against their own rebellious countrymen, and used chemical weapons against Iran in 1988. During the Gulf War, Iraq issued chemical warheads to Army units for possible use against American soldiers.  Recent defectors say U.N. weapons inspectors stand little chance of finding such weapons if and when they are allowed to return. According to these defectors, Saddam has stepped up his efforts. Scientists work under tremendous deadline pressure, and the results of their efforts are hidden in schools, buried in irrigation ditches and even kept mobile.   "They acquired seven trucks from Renault in France and they converted these refrigerated trucks into mobile biological labs," Nabel Musawi of the Iraqi National Congress, a London-based Iraqi opposition group, told ABCNEWS recently.    Now-known credibility problems with Musawi notwithstanding (no one knew then what we know now), the facts were indisputed. To say otherwise, and to put words in the mouth of the administration as though they were unique in their beliefs is, at best, intellectually dishonest.

Of course, we want to make sure Germany does things that make it happy. The last thing we need is a nation of irate Germans training Iraqi security forces in Iraq. Fortunately, though, further complications in modernizing the mission of NATO are simplified by the absence of France as even a pretend player, thanks to de Gaulle's withdrawal of France from the military arm of the alliance four decades ago. With only one member of Old Europe nipping at the heels of freedom's advance, more will likely get accomplished faster.

      Just received in the mail today David Bernstein's collection of articles discussing Lochner and its prodigy (er, disobedient children). Should be good reading.    Lochner v. New York  is every modern-day conservative's beacon of light in American jurisprudence. In it, the SCOTUS upheld the right to contract. In 1905, when it was decided, I suppose the concept of freedom was a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the idea of allowing individuals to negotiate freely, without government intervention, was too much for progressives to bear. The holding of Lochner was slowly but surely chipped away upon by the Court as the Great Depression set in, with the slow death ending in 1937 with  West Coast Hotel v. Parrish .  Bernstein's thesis is that Lochner is not completely dead. We just need the right case to revitalize it.

      Our esteemed (dripping sarcasm here) state house speaker Jimmy Naifeh, has some priceless time capsules in his camp down in Tipton County   Last week Dr. Jesse Cannon's (Republican candidate opposing Speaker Naifeh)wife Mickey and daughter Jessica ran into a hard core Democrat in Tipton County, who stated he was close to Speaker Naifeh, (we won't use his words) told the two African-American women that he thought it was fine that a "COLORED MAN" was running for office.  Jessica, one of TeamGOP's favorites, asked him in her best Dick Cheney tone..."which color would that be?"  The embarrassed man meekly apologized and scurried away. Does some Democrat really think that it was not "fine"  the "COLORED" Dr.Cannon would not run??? And who uses that word and what does it say about its user?   It sounds like Robert Byrd made a covert visit to Tennessee. Or better, that it's not the Republicans who have problems with race relations in this state. Courtesy of  urlLink TeamGOP .

      The Democratic strategy, per its two standard bearers, is nicely summed up by Daniel Henninger   For many Democrats, the vision of a city sliding down a hill is the continuing reality of America. In the version being tried for this election, economic growth is possible in a globalized world only if the middle class gets shafted. "We're moving backwards"--John Kerry, April 2004.   But the most recent Washington Post-ABC poll finds 64% of Americans optimistic about the economy's next 12 months, and more than half still optimistic about Iraq. Somebody here is on the wrong page. The Kerry-Edwards ethos of never-ending urgency and impending disaster is a weirdly European kind of politics, rooted more in the sadness of inevitable social tragedy than the largely uncontested American idea of individual possibility.    The most important part of Henninger's article is the second paragraph above - the Democratics are out of touch.

      The latest analysis on the status of "one-man, one-vote" in constitutional jurisprudence.  I still don't see the constitutional necessity for the principal at least in both houses for a state that has a bicameral legislature. States should be able to treat their regions and counties just as the United States Congress treats states for purposes of senatorial representation.   If anything, a freer hand in one house could very well represent diverse economic interests in the state more effectively. I know that would be the case in Tennessee, and would likely be so in any state of any geographical size. As long as one house is based on population distribution, the other house's districting should be reserved for the people to decide upon.  If one-man, one-vote is such an important principal, the Founders would never have authorized the US Senate (I know the purposes for the Senate were entirely different in its conception, but it still shows that there was some fudging to be done with a bicameral system regarding proportional representation).

       urlLink Daniel Drezner  has a great post on the pros and cons of quality and sensational blogging. His outlook is optimistic, though   1) In the long run, reputation matters. Sure, being a bombthrower can attract attention -- but it's hard to do successfully over a prolonged period of time. Inevitably this kind of ranting leads to major as well as minor missteps. Once a commentator commits a major rhetorical gaffe or colossal misstatement of fact, it becomes impossible to take them seriously. Which is why it's so easy to discount the statements of Ann Coulter, Noam Chomsky, Pat Robertson, or Michael Moore.   2) Technology can help as well as hinder. I've raved about MT-Blacklist before for blocking spam, but an unanticipated bonus has been the ease with which I can delete any comment. Blacklist rebuilds my site much more quickly than MT -- so it's been far easier to prune away comments now than before.   3) Commenters usually follow the blogger's lead. Whenever I use profanity in my posts, the language in the comments inevitably becomes coarser. This works in reverse, however -- the more civil my posts, the better the tone of the comments. In this respect, the presence of comments has affected me in one way -- I'm much more polite on the blog now than I used to be.   4) Compared to academia, this is a tea party. Another blogger once asked me whether I felt "surprised at the angry tone of the comments your readers leave... It can be odd to be shouted down on your own website."   Look, I'm an academic, and this stuff is nothing. I've attended seminars where the paper presenter ran out of the room because s/he was crying. I've presented papers that have been likened to poor undergratuate theses. I've had papers rejected by top journals because they were "narrow and without much theoretical interest." I've heard cruelties uttered that will be burned in people's psyches until the day they die. In other words, I'm used to a pretty high standard of criticism. Compared to that, a line like "Hey, Drezner, let's outsource your job, you f***ing a@#hole!" -- or letters like these -- just come off as histrionic nonsense.   5) Don't forget the benefits. Laura at Apartment 11D and Henry Farrell both point out the social value-added of blogs. Henry gets at something with this comment:   The most attractive ideal for the blogosphere that Ive come across is in sociologist Richard Sennetts brilliant, frustrating shaggy-dog of a book, The Fall of Public Man. Sennett is writing about the eighteenth century coffee-house as a place where people could escape from their private lives, reinventing themselves, and engaging in good conversation with others, regardless of their background or their everyday selves....  Like Sennetts patronizers of coffee shops, bloggers dont usually know each other before they start blogging, so that its quite easy for them to reinvent themselves if they like, and indeed to invent a pseudonym, or pseudonyms to disguise their real identity completely. This has its downside - some bloggers take it as license for offensive behaviour - but in general, if you dont like a blog, you can simply stop reading it, or linking to it. The blogosphere seems less to me like a close-knit community (there isnt much in the way of shared values, and only a bare minimum of shared norms), and more like a city neighborhood. An active, vibrant neighborhood when things are working; one with dog-turds littering the pavement when theyre not.   Worth a read.

      I think it only proper that I follow up a post extolling the virtues of communist loving Democratic presidential candidates with a tribute to the economic system that makes their nonsense possible.  Martha Nussbaum, a professor at the University of Chicago, writes  urlLink compellingly  about human suffering   Justice requires more. We give lip service to the idea that respect for human dignity is a fundamental moral requirement, and yet we daily allow human dignity to be violated by poverty, illiteracy, unequal liberty and other nation-based inequalities. Most of us, if pressed, would acknowledge that we belong not only to the community of our birth but also to the human community as a whole, and that we have obligations of some sort to that community. But because we are at a loss to say what those obligations are, we find it easier to lapse into inattention. Good theory helps people get a handle on their choices, making it more difficult for them to ignore their obligations.  Philosophical theories of global justice are, then, badly needed to give guidance to personal reflection and public policy. These theories will need to do a lot of hard philosophical work that has not been done before: to articulate accounts of the relationship between personal and institutional responsibility; to think about what is owed a nation that has been despoiled of resources by others in the past; to think how far and in what ways other nations ought to help nations that manage their internal affairs badly. They will have to face the thorny question of intervention. Since at least some governments of poor nations are accountable to the people of those nations, and since there is no transnational government in prospect that is likely to be adequately accountable, how far may we influence the internal affairs of another society, whether by governmental pressure or by material aid? And they will have to face the toughest question of all: How far are we required to do justice to the urgent claims of others who lie at a distance, when it means hurting the life quality of our own children?   A well posited question at the end. I venture my own answer, of course (being that it's my blog): American foreign intervention followed by free markets. The neoconservatives, for all the hell they're (we're) taking have figured that out. Unfortunately, the track record to date isn't yet sterling, not because of a failed ideology, but because success takes time. One cannot take a lawless, isolated land (Afghanistan) or a population oppressed for three decades (Iraq) and transform them into functioning democracies with free markets overnight. But you can do it over time.   As the learned professor stated, we have an obligation because no one else can.

      Here's a roundup of links from  urlLink Instapundit .  I'm rather unimpressed with the subject. In my estimation, Kerry would have been insane to choose anyone but Edwards. The only salvation would have been if Kerry's pride had gotten in the way of his better political judgment. It obviously did not.  Edwards is not to be feared in 2004 - he is to be feared in 2008 and beyond. Let's keep that in mind. As vice presidential material, he is inconsequential.  His  urlLink approvals  in his own state are abysmal from what I've read, and a recent  urlLink article  taking on a Kerry/Edwards ticket versus Bush/Cheney results in a Bush victory in the state. Remember, he only won his seat with a slim majority (51%) of the vote. There was a reason he was not running for reelection to the Senate, and it wasn't to go back to be a trial lawyer.  So, in a word, my analysis is "eh".

      I wonder whether the Bush campaign team was waiting for John Kerry's announcement to decide whether or not to keep Cheney on. Certainly Kerry considered Dick Cheney as the VP opponent when choosing Edwards (he basically said so himself). If Cheney were let go, and say (and I dream big dreams) Rudy Giuliani was chosen instead, it may have behooved Kerry to pick Hillary Clinton as his VP.  Who knows. If Cheney is kept on the ticket all of my hypothesizing will be for nought.

      The abortion stance Kerry has taken still bothers me. Not for the flip-flopping, though - with John Kerry, one must have a high threshold of tolerance for intellectual dishonesty to just observe him. It is the logical premise that one supposedly believes strongly in an issue but refuses to advance it that is bothersome. The belief that life begins at conception cannot be squared with the refusal to promote policies and laws that limit abortion.  This same vacuous thinking is often seen on the anti-war left, of which Kerry is sometimes and sometimes not a part. The whole premise that one can support the troops but not support their mission is as laughable as Kerry's recent pontifications on abortion. If the fetus is a life at conception, society ought condemn any course of action which seeks to kill it. Anything short of this condemns the society and the mores which allow the doublespeak.   The purpose of the military is to fight and defeat tyranny wherever it exists for the purpose of advancing the security interests of the United States. In short, the United States military exists to defend freedom. Its mission is its reason for being. To be against the mission is to oppose the existence of the institution, for without the mission, the military is pointless. The problem is that the media never asks the follow-up question: what is the military for, if it's not for what it's currently doing? The answer to that follow-up question would be telling, and would permanently dispel the notion that you can be for the troops and against the mission. As well, opposed to abortion while condoning its continuation.  John Kerry, the master of doublethought.

      Last night we shot off a significant amount of brightly colored gunpowder at my uncle's quasi-rural location in Wilson County. All around us individuals were shooting off fireworks, as well as those funded by municipalities around Percy Priest Lake, downtown Nashville, and Mt. Juliet, all of which we could see in the distance.  The noteworthy thing was that the number of houses shooting off their own wares was the highest any of us could remember, and for me, that goes back to the mid 1990's. I began to wonder whether there is a correlation between fireworks bought and the state of the economy.  Fireworks are the ultimate in consumable goods. For what they are, they aren't cheap (even if you can whittle the guys selling them at 6pm on July 4th down a bit, it's still gunpowder wrapped in pretty paper). Fireworks are almost instantly used, and do nothing more than create a short-lived colorful array in the sky a little ways overhead. In short, you've got to have some extra cash and be feeling reasonably confident you're not going to need that cash in order to buy them, especially when there are so many places one can "free ride" and watch fireworks at no cost.  I am curious, though, whether private firework shooting and economic confidence go together. If anyone has any data anywhere on this premise I'd love to see it. Of course, one would have to have a formula, in order to discount other factors, such as patriotic fervor aside from economic certainty, and so forth, but even that may be able to be discounted due to the prospects for free riding I noted above.  If anyone has any thoughts, please feel free to let me know.

      John Kerry must think the electorate especially  urlLink gullible  - to particularly include we cretans on the pro-life side.   "I oppose abortion, personally. I don't like abortion. I believe life does begin at conception."    To contrast with this   Afterward, several parishioners asked him about his position on abortion and his vote against a recent bill that would have banned the late-term procedure opponents call "partial birth" abortion, according to a reporter for the Telegraph Herald who sat behind Kerry's pew. Kerry replied that he would have supported the ban if it had included an exception for the health of the mother.    To say one believes life begins at conception, then fall back and vote against a bill banning a gruesome procedure such as this, is incredulous. Then in April, he showed his  urlLink pro-choice credentials  at a rally including Planned Parenthood and NARAL, among others   "Abortion should be rare, but it should be safe and legal -- and the government should stay out of the bedrooms of America," he said to cheers and applause.   But if life begins at conception, Mr. Kerry, you have made the intellectually equivalent argument that killing is ok, but only when it's none of your business - a position that is very convenient and very unfortunate.  Just another example of Kerry's flip-flopping. He goes out to the Midwest, where folks are more socially conservative, and tries to pull this nonsense.

According to Iraqi police, the would-be attacker was stopped Sunday for a routine search at an Iraqi National Guard checkpoint near the unit's headquarters. The driver jumped from the vehicle, shouted "God is great" and "I'm going to kill you."  Guardsmen opened fire, killing him and triggering the explosives in the car, according to police chief Waleed al-Azawi. Two bystanders were killed in the explosion, hospital officials said.   The more of this we see, the better off Iraq will be.

But her recent statements to the press, and her interview with Barbara Walters, have erased my skepticism. &nbsp; Her pride is her downfall.&nbsp; She claims she is being punished for cheating people. No, she's now being punished for her inability to swallow her pride and for her arrogance.&nbsp; To be so smart, her tactical decisions have&nbsp;shown a certain compartmentalized&nbsp;stupidity. She gets what she deserves. &nbsp; And for those gender baiters, no, she is not being punished for being a woman. She is being punished for lying and believing she was above the law.&nbsp; Of course, I'd imagine the same people rallying to her defense are the same people who believe Clinton was mistreated for lying under oath.&nbsp; Martha Stewart - among&nbsp;the most inconsequential trials ever.  &nbsp; If you want to see the way real corporate malfeasance is treated, watched the Enron indictments.&nbsp; No matter what you think of Martha Stewart's punishment, it doesn't hold a candle to what  urlLink Andrew Fastow  received.&nbsp; And his upward exposure was immense.

      The last day or two have been quite hectic. These things happen, especially to attorneys with limited support staff. Today shouldn't be too bad, though.   Registered voter polls - we know how I feel about them - can also be encouraging. Since they lean left, ties are a good thing.  LA Times did another one of their polls (who knows, maybe communist monocled monkeys were part of the sample this time) that had Wisconsin tied, and Bush up twelve in Missouri. All a good thing.  I'm still trying to get my mind around that huge lead in North Carolina for Bush after the Edwards selection for VP. If that's the way Edwards is going to carry the South for Kerry, we're in fantastic shape.

      I opposed the lottery in Tennessee personally. Not because I have this phobic view on gambling, but because I don't care for the idea of giving the state legislature billions of dollars to spend. Somehow I don't trust them to spend it all on education. Plus, it's a tax on the poor. Go to your local Mapco and see who are the majority of people buying the tickets. But to squabble over the salaries and compensation packages of lottery execs, which are low in view of the size of the operation and what is comparable in the private sector, is innane.   State Sen. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, the chief sponsor of the lottery, said the executives free-loaded off the lottery too long in temporary housing.  ''I think these moving expenses are just part of a condition that needs to be reined in,'' he said. ''All the expenses of the lottery need to be examined closely and re-examined. They've not done a good enough job to keep expenses low.''   Right. Because this doesn't matter    But the lottery, which started Jan. 20, began 16 days ahead of schedule and kicked off the multistate Powerball game earlier than anyone thought possible, Hill said.   Only because every day started early meant a gain in $800,000 to $1,000,000 in revenue. The total in "moving expenses" that Senator Cohen and others are so maturely complaining about totaled $50,000.00. Geeze. Get some perspective. I'm not a fan of the lottery, but the supporters of it have no clue what they're doing. If they're going to get bent out of shape about a conservative gain of $12.8 million for a cost of $50,000, they don't need to be in government. I'm not sure where they should be, or who would hire them, but they shouldn't be in government.  In other words,  urlLink this  justifies  urlLink this .

The most noted contrast between Bush and Kerry in this poll is the perception that the candidate is intelligent.

Those five percent are perhaps the most oblivious non-ketchup eating people in the nation.   Oh, and only eighty percent of the sample were even registered voters. Enjoy with a grain of salt.

       urlLink Tyler Cowen  weighs in on  urlLink Jacob Levy's  proposal to vote libertarian. I take issue with his first point in his analysis.   1. Your vote will not count, no matter what. If the election is close, the courts will decide it. "They" won't let me (or Jacob) decide an election.  2. The most important effect of your vote is on yourself. Over time people come to identify with their previous political commitments. "Digging in" is a much more frequent phenomenon than is "conversion." If you vote libertarian [fill in another other party name here], you will likely become more libertarian over time.  3. So ask yourself whether you wish to become, both publicly and privately, more toward the mainstream or more toward your potential third party vote. Make your decision accordingly.   Only because there is already one instance where point number one does not apply: the 2000 election.  The electors were already certified, and would have been certified by Florida legislature, regardless. The SCOTUS intervened to stop the bleeding, not decide the election. If the Court had stayed out (which would have been the preferable option), the House would get to decide whether to accept the Bush electors.   So, in effect, if you lived anywhere else in the country, you would have gotten two votes. One for president, and one for your congressman who would have decided the election. If you lived in Florida, you got up to three votes. One for president, one for your congressman who would have decided the election, and one for your state legislator who voted to certify the electors.  The second two points are completely valid, but the natural scenario is no court involvement whatsoever, even in a close race for president. Of course, races for lesser offices are entirely different, and point one might well apply.

      Just submitted this a moment ago.   Kerry / Edwards?  To the Editor:  President Bush has little to be concerned about with the Kerry / Edwards ticket.  There have been various theories advanced as to whether the choice of Edwards will mean anything in the upcoming election.  The answer, it seems to be, is a resounding no.  The latest poll by Newsweek, which was released Saturday after the pick of Edwards, is a testament to this fact.  Though a registered voter poll (which, typically makes for a useless poll), the left-leaning sample still does not give the John ticket a statistically significant lead.  Further, half of all registered voters dont vote. The telling number is that the majority of the those who dont vote think that a majority of those who do vote will vote for President Bush.

      I hate them. They are useless and should never be done. Registered voters are not likely voters. In fact, half of registered voters don't vote for president, and the further you move down the ballot, the more remote is the possibility that a significant number of registered voters will vote at all.  I only rant on this subject because CNN International has been reporting regularly on that silly  urlLink Newsweek Registered Voter poll  for the last hour or so. I know - that's what I get for watching CNN  International . The poll is well within the margin of error of 3 points, and it's slanted left because of the sample. Additionally, it was only done over two days. Too much attention for too little substance.  The real story, as Newsweek itself points out, is that the choice of John Edwards has meant nothing to Kerry's chances.    Although the John Kerry campaign enjoyed a rush of positive media coverage after announcing that John Edwards would be the Democratic candidates running mate, it is still locked in a dead heat with the Republican ticket, according to the first NEWSWEEK poll conducted since Edwards was tapped.   And then there is this   The survey also found that more voters think President George W. Bush will be re-elected than think Kerry will take the White House.    So there. A lot of people who don't vote think that a lot of people who do vote will vote for George W. Bush.

The Thai prime minister, as the good host, has announced that Thailand will contribute $5 million over 5 years to the U.N. to fight AIDS. Gee. Wow. AIDS in Thailand is enough of a problem. I'm not sure it's good policy for Thailand to send money out-of-country.

But here's how the United States, the leader in fighting AIDS worldwide, was treated   Organizers criticized a U.S. decision to send a pared-down delegation that forced some researchers to cancel presentations, with delegates saying they believe it was a message that the conference wasn't focused enough on abstinence.  The U.S. stance sends "a strange signal" from the largest donor nation to anti-AIDS efforts, conference co-chairman Joep Lange said. "These ideological games are very counterproductive," he said.    Ideological games?  urlLink $15 billion  over five years has been earmarked to fight the world AIDS epidemic. AIDS spreads in the third world precisely because of promiscuity, not despite it. If anyone is playing ideological games, it's the United Nations. They debate purposelessly, and we act decisively. We put out money where our mouth is. They take money out of the mouths of Iraqi children.   If AIDS will be defeated, it will be defeated like any other encroaching destructive force on this planet. It will be defeated by the United States. There is certainly a good  urlLink national security  and economics argument for controlling and rolling back the AIDS epidemic (which I will write more on later). And we are currently doing a lot right now to make sure that  urlLink happens .  UPDATE: It's quite possible  urlLink Bill Gates  (who, by the way, is an American) has spent more money fighting AIDs than the rest of the world combined.  UPDATE: If it wasn't for the picture, I would have thought I had found Bill Gates  urlLink pseudonym .

       urlLink Al Hunt  has an article in the Wall Street Journal today. If sycophancy were a kingdom, Mr. Hunt would rule it as a true believer.&nbsp; About the upcoming Democratic convention and the party legacy (pun intended) of Bill Clinton, Hunt espouses the following   He moved the Democrats to the center while keeping the party's political base energized and committed.    That is manifest in the lack of any controversy at the 44th convention of the world's oldest political party; Democrats have put aside their penchant for fractious--often irrelevant--fights over the platform or party rules. The Clinton agenda is the agenda of Democrats of most every stripe.   First of all, the position Hunt stakes out is completely amorphus, which is certainly an appropriate tact to take with his subject.&nbsp; Which agenda is he referring to? Winning at any cost? It seems so   Politically, says former Clinton aide and now Congressman Rahm Emanuel, "We're the Vince Lombardi party. Winning is everything."    &nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; What a worthwhile agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;In football, winning is indeed everything. In politics, adults understand the stakes are&nbsp;a little higher.&nbsp; Seeking power for the sole sake of exercising it is a dangerous path to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agenda that Hunt is describing in such glowful terms throughout his piece is&nbsp;that path.&nbsp; It is a path that&nbsp;was empaneled in Clinton's presidency, and was embodied in the effort to ensure his political survival.   To be sure, others deserve credit too. As president, Bill Clinton never could have kept Democrats unified without the incalculable assistance of Newt Gingrich and Ken Starr. And John Kerry's ability to transcend the party's customary interest groups and raise unimaginable sums of money would not have been possible without George W. Bush. The current president has unified America--into two distinct and solidly partisan blocs. &nbsp;  It's easier to defend the indefensible when you are unprincipled.&nbsp; Principles sometimes&nbsp;require the abandonment of an individual, because any principle worth believing in is larger than any one person.&nbsp; If your goal is power, and the means employed&nbsp; are purely Machiavellian,&nbsp;the only concern&nbsp;is with the vehicle that gets you where you want to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;When your agenda is held together&nbsp;with a&nbsp;hate based adhesive, you have no agenda worth having.   The Democrats of today are not the heirs of the previous generations.&nbsp; Democrats today are no more related to FDR or Kennedy than a bullfrog is to an elephant.   More unbelievably, Mr. Hunt believes that Bill Clinton strengthened the Democratic Party, allegedly by moving it to the center.&nbsp; Bill Clinton strengthened  himself  by moving to the center - but he used the members of his party as political bodyguards, all of whom were expected to take a bullet for him.&nbsp; And many bullets did they take.&nbsp; His presidency saw the loss of the House of Representatives, the Senate, the majority of governorships, and a significant number of state legislatures.&nbsp; His vice president lost an election that he should have easily won.&nbsp; Most of his former cabinet members who ran for office were defeated (Bill Richardson being the more significant exception).&nbsp; So, by Al Hunt's twisted logic, the more Democrats lose, the stronger they become.&nbsp;   Come back to reality, Al - we're waiting on you.

      Check out this email that came in&nbsp;from the  urlLink Davidson County Young Republicans website  (no editing done)    hey guys... was browsing the web...&nbsp; you know&nbsp; keep your enemies close....&nbsp; letting you know my name is kenny&nbsp;and i am working harder than anyone, i mean anyone you have to get bush out of office....&nbsp; he has ruined the airline business's with his allowing oil prices to soar...&nbsp; i was laid off after 19 years of service to a major airline....&nbsp;bush has also ruined our nations standing in the world community as the world's leader.... we are now the most hated&nbsp;nation in the world and most obnoxious ......oh, yea he cut taxes for the wealthest 1% they should be happy...but his brother wont be able to steal this election not this time....i would love to debate more....&nbsp; but im proud to say as an individual&nbsp;i have signed up 310 new voters so far this year all to vote for the next president of the united states of america&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOHN KERRY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good luck in your campaign, only an act of god can win it for you and&nbsp;lets face it&nbsp; even jesus was a democrat...&nbsp; he was a working man and took care of the homeless, the drunks, those with disease and no health care, unlike our president today...&nbsp;&nbsp; happy campaigning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kenny defriese &nbsp;&nbsp;   So, obviously, Mr. Defriese is in need of some psychological assistance and a few primers on history.&nbsp; But most importantly, this demonstrates what we're up against in this election.&nbsp; The enemy is not Al Qaeda, nor was it Saddam Hussein.&nbsp; The worst possible enemy is George W. Bush.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Now for just a little fun.&nbsp; Everyone I know got a tax cut (including Mr. Defriese). The&nbsp;wealthiest 1% must be huge -&nbsp;a lot bigger than I originally thought.&nbsp; Maybe it's just been too hot lately,&nbsp;and the Ford Explorer in my driveway is really a mirage.&nbsp; I actually own a 2004 Escalade, and my a/c isn't about to kick out on me.&nbsp; My house must be twice as big, but as a Republican I'm just not smart enough to find the other half.&nbsp; If I'm in the top 1%, and rich, we all really are in trouble.   Hated by who? France? Germany? There's a psychological term for that hatred, which can be metaphorically&nbsp;described as&nbsp;"missile envy".   And as a final tidbit, I imagine that nationalized healthcare in Jesus' day would have been, well, interesting at best.&nbsp; I would be all for a national system if the method of treatment consisted solely of miracle healing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the 21st century, the era for that method has long since passed.&nbsp; To stress the comparison a little more beyond the absurd, it should be noted that&nbsp;Jesus acted as a private citizen, not as a Roman bureaucrat administering a compulsory healthcare system.&nbsp; Unless Mr. Defriese can prove otherwise, I will continue to hold to my&nbsp; doubts that&nbsp;at any time in His ministry that Jesus was on the Roman payroll.   Oh yes - Bush won Florida by 537 votes - 310 just won't be enough. Cheers!   UPDATE&nbsp; Further research and commentary, courtesy of my good&nbsp;friend Bob Krumm,&nbsp;has shown that Mr. Defriese lives in Franklin, just south of Nashville, in one of the most Republican areas of the state.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, he has further lied.&nbsp; We'll find Osama Bin Laden having&nbsp;cocktails with Ariel Sharon&nbsp;&nbsp;before we'll find&nbsp;310 Democrats in Franklin.   It also seems he gave money to what must have been a relative who ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary against now State Senator Jim Bryson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting.  Google is a glorious thing.

      The New York Times, apparently an avid supporter of Linda Ronstadt (who knew?) has decided to  urlLink rewrite the First Amendment . Here's the moneyquote of utter ignorance   This behavior assumes that Ms. Ronstadt had no right to express a political opinion from the stage. It implies - for some members of the audience at least - that there is a philosophical contract that says an artist must entertain an audience only in the ways that audience sees fit. It argues, in fact, that an artist like Ms. Ronstadt does not have the same rights as everyone else.    &nbsp; I know not where to begin.&nbsp; Guess what? Ms. Ronstadt indeed  did not  have a right to express a political opinion from the stage.&nbsp; In fact, she did not have a constitutional right to even be on that stage. She certainly had a contractual right to be there (weakened somewhat by the fall of  Lochner , a constitutional doctrine that the editorial board at the NYT certainly would oppose if they knew what it was), but when she uttered those assinine remarks about the demigod status of Michael Moore she likely violated the terms of her contract, which was to entertain, not offend.&nbsp;   Whew.&nbsp; That was just on the first sentence of that excerpt.  Second sentence.&nbsp; So, the entertainer had more "rights" than the audience.&nbsp; I'm not sure why, exactly, unless one holds an overinflated view of people who are blessed with well choreographed vocal cords.&nbsp; The wording used is bothersome.&nbsp; If the audience is not entertained in a way they see fit, they are in fact not entertained at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, sentence number two makes as much sense as a barrcuda  urlLink attending a G8 Summit protest .&nbsp;   Finally, sentence number three. The whopper of them all.&nbsp; What rights do the rest of us have, or more particularly, what rights did that audience have, that Ms. Ronstadt did not?&nbsp; If someone comes into my home, and insults my wife, or my dog, I certainly have a right to not let them sleep in my spare bedroom.&nbsp; In fact, they don't get the futon.&nbsp; They get kicked out (and can stay at that luxurious Family Inn just down the road).&nbsp; What rights have been denied? In fact, private property rights&nbsp;have been&nbsp;vindicated, as are my free speech rights. Why would someone else's free speech rights be superior to mine? If the rights wash out, as they should,&nbsp;you go to the subquestion - is their a private property factor.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;who trumps?&nbsp; The metaphor extends precisely to Ms. Ronstadt's utterly stupid comments, and her breach of her contract with the Aladdin Hotel.&nbsp;   The New York Times - always underperforming.

      The answer seems, well, elementary.&nbsp; But Kerry and his surrogates are in fact  urlLink blaming  Bush  .&nbsp; The timing, you know, it's all about the timing.&nbsp; The timing is so political.&nbsp; According to Kerry et al, uber breaches of national security should come without the added bonus of political humiliation.&nbsp; Somehow, the theft (and destruction) of every known copy of a report that is hypercritical of his boss right before a federal commission interviews said boss is of no import.&nbsp; The squelching of the most top secret information for political gain should, well, be brushed under the rug.&nbsp; The carrying around of said documents like spare toilet paper is no big deal.&nbsp; In fact, it was Bush who made Berger do it.&nbsp; A seance at the White House was conducted, I'm sure, to invigorate Sandy Berger's being with the spirit of Lee Atwater, in an attempt to humiliate yet another Massachusetts liberal.&nbsp; It all makes perfect sense in the la la land of Democratic politics where&nbsp;Kerry and Edwards are the new Sonny and Cher.&nbsp;  Upon discussing zippergate with a friend last night, the&nbsp;conversation turned to how exactly one "incidentally" or "accidentally" inserts documents in one's pants.&nbsp; The more you think about it, the odder the thought becomes. &nbsp;So a trial experiment was conducted.&nbsp; Documents were on the table, and a&nbsp;trial&nbsp;insertion was&nbsp;successfully attempted.&nbsp; In fairness, it looked damned funny.&nbsp; To imagine the guy who used to have Condoleeza Rice's job do it,&nbsp;though,&nbsp;wasn't funny - it was alarming.&nbsp; And his denials! Plausible deniability from the national security advisor regarding classified documents? Hardly.&nbsp; I'm an attorney.&nbsp; There are certain things you can't claim ignorance on once you achieve a certain level of expertise.&nbsp; For instance, I can never plausibly say I didn't know the law.&nbsp; I should know better.&nbsp; Sandy Berger cannot say he didn't know he wasn't supposed to stuff classified documents in his classified areas.&nbsp; He certainly should know better.&nbsp;&nbsp;   This is bigger than anyone thinks.&nbsp; Just stay tuned.

It's hard to think of anything that looks less innocent than stuffing documents into his pants. Did Berger tell the 9/11 commissioners he was just glad to see them?    &nbsp; James Taranto - nothing less than a brilliant comedic mind (with some good analysis to boot!)

      I don't feel bad making these posts because I know that all of you who glaze over that mention of legal intricacy have this handy thing called a "scroll button" on your mouse.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Tomorrow I'm slated to argue a post conviction petition in Judge Blackburn's court here in Davidson County.&nbsp; The crux of the argument that my client should be granted&nbsp; a new trial is that the&nbsp; Blakely v. Washington &nbsp;case the SCOTUS decided last month ought to be applied retroactively.&nbsp; I have a good argument for differentiating  Blakely  from&nbsp; Summerlin  (where the Court&nbsp;refused to apply  Ring v. Arizona  retroactively), and hope for victory tomorrow.&nbsp; If  Blakely  does not convey a watershed rule in criminal procedure, per  Teague v. Lane ,&nbsp;I'm not sure what will. &nbsp; If all fails, and it likely will, I'm on my way to the Tennessee Supreme Court (via the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, of course).

      To show that they are not in fact "girlie men,"&nbsp; Californian Democrats have taken the high road and are adamant about completing the state's budget in time for the end of session.&nbsp; In a call for civility, the Senate leadership vowed to make sure that members of its caucus would work diligently to balance the&nbsp;books and secure funding for government functions&nbsp;through cuts, and&nbsp;without raising taxes.  &nbsp;  Yeah. And girlie men vote Republican.  &nbsp;  Here's what  urlLink actually happened .  &nbsp;   "I was a little bit worried about whether Arnold thought he was elected God or elected governor," said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, venting the anger of Democrats. "The governor talks to us one day about working together and together we can get this done and then another day going out and insulting our masculinity."   &nbsp;  Apparently masculinity is easily damaged in San Francisco.&nbsp; More apparently, the&nbsp;doctrinaire&nbsp;Democrat from San Francisco has a rather twisted view on God, somehow surmising that&nbsp;God gets his joys from emasculating his subjects.&nbsp; Lots of messed up things happened in the Old Testament, but I don't believe the complete emasculation of any&nbsp;city state opposing the Jews was one of them.&nbsp; Fire from heaven maybe, trumpets turning walls to dust, sure, but mass castration....eh, don't remember that one from Sunday school. &nbsp; In spirit,&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley, the cradle of sane and critical thought,&nbsp;concurs  &nbsp;   "He is exhibiting signs of severe confusion," said Bruce Cain, a UC Berkeley professor of political science. "He's going down the path of trying to keep the (Republican) Party happy and is squandering an unprecedented opportunity for bipartisanship." &nbsp; &nbsp;  Translation: projection of one's own situation onto another - the Democrats are in a tailspin.&nbsp; And in an apt analogy  &nbsp;   "You can't go kick somebody in the groin and then say let's ... join hands and sing 'Kumbaya,' " Burton said. "It doesn't work that way in life, it doesn't work that way in politics and it doesn't really work that way in the Capitol."   &nbsp;  Apparently not.&nbsp; But if you kicked a girlie man in the groin, would he notice?&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Speaker Pro Tem from San Francisco was not done&nbsp;showing his displeasure  &nbsp;   Burton brought to his press conference his espresso machine with a "closed until further notice" sign on it. Burton, who often brought steamed milk for the governor to meetings, said the governor would have to go without the frothy beverage.   &nbsp;  That'll show him.&nbsp; Senator Burton is not a girlie man because he will no longer provide the governor&nbsp;froth.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the speech, however, froth was no longer scarce  &nbsp;   "No matter what happens there will be a Democratic majority in the Assembly and the Senate," Burton promised.     &nbsp;  Billions of dollars are at stake, and the California legislature makes its stand via an inapposite espresso metaphor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nuts abound out West.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for all of&nbsp;us down South, we know a girlie man when we see it.   &nbsp;

       urlLink SCOTUS Blog  has sources, above and beyond what we can muster, that tell him the Solicitor General is preparing a request for cert from the SCOTUS in light of a circuit split on how Blakely applies to the federal sentencing guidelines. &nbsp;  Our sources who litigate these cases and have excellent contacts (you know who you are, and we thank you) tell us that there is an excellent prospect that the Solicitor General will likely take the post-Blakely questions under the Guidelines to the Supreme Court on Wednesday. One or both of two filings are contemplated: a cert. petition in the Seventh Circuit's Booker case (in which Judges Posner and Easterbrook divided); and a petition for cert. before judgment in United States v. Fanfan (a district court decision from the District of Maine that was just appealed by the government to the First Circuit). Both cases involve drug conspiracies. The government will move to expedite both the cert. and merits stages of the cases, seeking: that any response to the petitions be filed within a week, that cert. be granted by August 2, and that merits briefing be completed by mid-September or early-October (under alternative schedules that are being discussed). Argument would be held immediately thereafter.    &nbsp; I wouldn't hold my breath for a clear answer (considering that  Blakely  was to clarify  Apprendi , ha).&nbsp; Regardless, the High Court can be clear when they want to be, and are vague when the purpose suits them.&nbsp; The Guidelines do need to be ruled upon&nbsp;- this sort of limbo is unsustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Court was hoping to muddy the waters a bit with  Blakely , just to see what solutions and applications the federal district courts and the circuit courts would come up with, they've gotten their wish, and can now proceed to select the best option.&nbsp; It sounds like a quasi-federalist approach to adjudication, which is peculiar, but not necessarily a bad thing.

I am a former Democrat. &nbsp; I was the Vice-President of my College Democrats (GO TERPS ... FEAR THE TURTLE!).&nbsp; I wore all of the right buttons and had the politically-correct bumper stickers.&nbsp; And, I was a White House intern under Bill Clinton.&nbsp; Well, not literally under him.&nbsp; I was there in the Fall of 1995, in the same intern class as one Monica Lewinsky.&nbsp; Various events, and a general decision to grow up, have altered my outlook for the better.&nbsp; I plan to expand on this evolution in future entries, so hold that baited breath! &nbsp; 2.  I am a former public school teacher. &nbsp; I taught high school government and history for several years.&nbsp; My frustration with the teachers' union, the lack of accountability by anyone involved in the process, and the pressure to dumb down classes to meet the dwindling attention spans of our teenagers forced me from the system.&nbsp; I could not participate in a process to which I was so fundamentally opposed.&nbsp; This experience also helped to solidify my transition to the Right. &nbsp; 3.  I am former Beltway girl learning to appreciate the "flyover" states. &nbsp; I grew up just outside Washington, D.C. and moved to Nashville two years ago, just after getting married.&nbsp; My appreciation for the "Real America" (which is&nbsp;regularly discussed&nbsp;by my favorite talk radio guy, Glenn Beck) grows every day. &nbsp; I look forward to having this outlet to vent, analyze, question and challenge.&nbsp; I am now a writer by trade, and I appreciate all outlets to further my craft.&nbsp; Stay tuned!

      Apparently, e-commerce is not going to drain the coffers of sales tax based tax regimes after all.&nbsp; One of the biggest intellectual&nbsp;supporters of the state income tax in Tennessee, Bill Cox,&nbsp;has  urlLink backtracked .&nbsp;  &nbsp; The reasons are peculiar, though. The revisions in cost to the state associated&nbsp;with a sales tax regime results from slower than anticipated growth in e-commerce, not admission of an erroneous methodology (which would be preferable).&nbsp; Details are very much needed.&nbsp; Inaccurate growth projections&nbsp;in e-commerce could happen to anyone, as e-commerce is a new phenomenon. I'm not quite as quick to condemn the proponents of a&nbsp;state income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;on the basis of Prof. Fox's revisions as  urlLink Bill Hobbs . It's not as if slow growth in e-commerce is a good thing, and certainly not&nbsp;anything that we as free market capitalists should be hanging our hats on to win an argument.&nbsp; My response to lost revenue from e-commerce sales is "who cares?".&nbsp;&nbsp; There are sufficient reasons to oppose a state income tax regardless of this study by Prof. Fox.&nbsp;

      Slate's Fred Kaplan still does not get it &nbsp;  The key failure is that Bush said nothingand has planned nothingabout devising a general international policy toward nonproliferation. Police enforcement can go only so far. An effective policy must deal with the reasons certain nations want to go nuclearand the incentives, as well as the punishments, that might deter them from doing so.    &nbsp; Once more, it is up to us to search for "root causes,"&nbsp;besides, of course, for the obvious&nbsp;reason why Islamist regimes wish our demise -&nbsp; simply that we exist and we are free.&nbsp;&nbsp; His anaylsis concludes that credible force and negotiation are mutually exclusive concepts, each existing in its own vacuum.&nbsp; This formula is contrary to history and contrary to common sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; His quip about Iraqis wanting to leave Iraq means little, save that now, since American involvement, Iraqis are now free to leave Iraq. Prior to the liberation, they could not leave through legal means - they could only escape.&nbsp; Further, such a jab demonstrates a certain lack of perspective.&nbsp; When viewed through the lens of other reconstruction efforts, the postwar recovery in Iraq is moving along rather nicely.&nbsp; Jobs will come as stability takes hold.&nbsp; Taking back the country is beyond the insurgents capability.&nbsp; That stability is just around the corner.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyone who thinks that the removal of Saddam Hussein, the removal of the Taliban, and the surrender of quantities of loose uranium from Libya does not make the world safer lives in a partisan fantasy world.&nbsp; Mr. Kaplan plays the role of Willy Wonka quite well.

      I tend to brush off most articles on the "culture war" in America because they all tend to say the same thing.&nbsp;  urlLink Morris Fiorina  has a slightly different twist, looking at the culture war in a more dynamic perspective  &nbsp;  If swing voters have disappeared, how did the six blue states in which George W. Bush ran most poorly in 2000 all elect Republican governors in 2002 (and how did Arnold Schwarzenegger run away with the 2003 recall in blue California)? If almost all voters have already made up their minds about their 2004 votes, then why did John Kerry surge to a 14-point trial-heat lead when polls offered voters the prospect of a Kerry-McCain ticket? If voter partisanship has hardened into concrete, why do virtually identical majorities in both red and blue states favor divided control of the presidency and Congress, rather than unified control by their party? Finally, and ironically, if voter positions have become so uncompromising, why did a recent CBS story titled "Polarization in America" report that 76% of Republicans, 87% of Democrats and 86% of independents would like to see elected officials compromise more rather than stick to their principles?    &nbsp; It's worth a read.

      I must take issue with the myriad  urlLink posts  on various blogs and articles by opinion journalists as of late questioning whether or not the Republican base is "shored up."  &nbsp; It is. This is why. &nbsp; I concede the initial conservative&nbsp;problem with the Bush administration.&nbsp; It spends money domestically like it's water.&nbsp; I personally dislike Bush's spending, but in the grand geopolitical scheme, it's largely irrelevant.&nbsp; The&nbsp;conservative base of the Republican&nbsp;Party is also the staunchest supporter of Bush's foreign policy, whose importance to that same base&nbsp;dwarfs the excesses of&nbsp;free-wheeling domestic spending (er, triangulation) that Bush has pursued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throw in significant tax cuts, whose permanence will be a primary point of contention going into November, and the neutralization of the gay marriage issue with the FMA, and the base is, well, content.&nbsp;  &nbsp; A better question is whether the rabid shoring up of the liberally insane by the Democratic Party will alienate people not yet convinced that Bush is a minion of Lucifer.

      The  urlLink New York Times  makes a stab at defining young conservatism.&nbsp; I do object to the technique, however, of painting neoconservatives as intellectual bastard children of Buckley's original conservative movement.&nbsp; There is a convincing argument that neoconservatism is in fact the rightful heir of Buckley's cause, not an obstacle to it.&nbsp; To attribute ownership of&nbsp;conservatism to the paleoconservative Buchananites is inaccurate, and likely intentional. &nbsp; In all fairness, I hope the Times takes the, well, time, to address the fractuous nature of pos-hippy liberalism.&nbsp; It would make for a much more interesting read, and would shed light on a more severely divided side of the political spectrum.&nbsp; Any ideology that expresses itself through personal hatred is more of a personality cult than a movement, which modern day liberalism and the Democratic party have become.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no doubt, though, and the article gets it right, that social conservatives and libertarians are of a different ilk.&nbsp; But then again, neither side has anywhere to go.&nbsp; As long as the Libertarian Party remains composed of unelectable kooks, the Republican Party will remain ideologically solvent.&nbsp; Regardless, the Times has created a decent summary, and it is worth a look. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      So much for visiting churches affiliated with the  urlLink Presbyterian Church (USA).    By the overwhelming vote of 431-62, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) recently adopted a resolution calling for a divestment campaign from corporations doing business with Israel.     Even more perplexing is that the denomination holds $7 billion in assets in communist China. The money quotes   The church is not calling for divestment of its $7 billion portfolio from China, despite China's denial of the most basic political and religious rights and its particularly harsh treatment of followers of Falun Gong. It is not condemning Russia, even though Russia's policies in Chechnya are by any human-rights standard atrocious. It is not even calling for economic sanctions against Syria or Iran, whose human-rights records for their own people are egregious and whose Jewish citizens are denied the basic civil rights and liberties afforded to all Israelis, including its Arab citizens, some of whom even serve in the Knesset.     Priorities are beyond misplaced. I hate to say it, but the General Assembly is either extraordinary myopic, ignorant, or anti-semitic. I say just take one's pick - they all arrive at the same place.

      The bounce from the DNC for John John?  urlLink 4 points!    Kerrys four-point bounce is the smallest in the history of the NEWSWEEK poll.   Wow. Could that be any worse? MSNBC attempts to explain it away, of course. I watched the sampling they did with the focus group after the Kerry speech - the bias with the weenie doing the focusing was extraordinary. MSNBC has no shame, though I give Chris Matthews credit for asking some tough questions over the four days.  And the kicker - it was a registered voters poll, which always skews Democratic. So it's quite possible that the Johns got  zero  bounce from the convention. Now, that would be embarrassing.  No,  this  would be embarassing. A likely voter poll done by  urlLink Rasmussen Research  shows a  fall , not a bounce.  In short, partisanship aside, the DNC was a bonafide failure. The longest infomercial they're going to get, and no ground is gained. Ouch.  UPDATE Zogby sees  urlLink no bounce  for Johnx2

       urlLink Zell Miller's  article is subtitled  Why I Skipped the Boston Convention .  I would got out on a limb and say the Senator was not given the warmest of invitations.  I would go even further and say that the DNC leadership was more interested in having Bill O'Reilly wander the convention floor than the senator from Georgia.  But in reality, Miller is a Democratic by association, not by belief.  He is of the old school, when the South was a one-party region. The Democratic counterparts in the South were never as liberal as those in the North. The political alignment didn't really change until the early 1990s, culminating in the 1994 landslides.  Anyhow, Senator Miler is more than welcome in New York. I look forward to his speech.

       urlLink Blake Wylie  investigates the problems inherent in gun control - increases in crime rates.  The correlation seems obvious, which is probably why we didn't hear a peep out of the Million Mom March types at the DNC this year. It's a losing issue.  It's an issue that largely cost Gore Tennessee in 2000 (in addition to wholesale abandonment of the state years before). We in the South, and elsewhere who understand how to properly use firearms have long understood this. The places where the Dems are going to win anyway, where the populace sees the gun as some mythical orb of destruction, many of whom have never actually touched a real firearm, are never going to understand the issue pragmatically anyhow. So the result? Don't mention it.  Ireland has wholesale banned firearms on the island for some time now.  The criminal mind, which most assuredly is more intuitive than the progressive liberal mind, has taken notice.  Next time you go to Ireland, order a kevlar vest along with your pint of Smithwick's.   England has a similar gun policy, and has experienced the expected rise in crime.  The all-knowing officials in the UK attempt to explain the rise in crime in terms of low wages, which have created a land of inopportunity.  Problem is, the lack of the most efficient method of civilian protection creates an even larger land of opportunity for those who specialize in theft and intimidation.  Geeze.  Sometimes it hurts the brain to be progressive.

      John Kerry's speech was interesting last night.&nbsp; I wasn't sure what to expect, and was somewhat surprised, both in the content and in the nervous delivery.&nbsp; I've never seen a politician speak over his applause lines like Kerry did last night.&nbsp; It was almost disrespectful&nbsp;to his audience, and certainly was evident to those of us watching at home.&nbsp;   The Democrats have attempted to move to the right on issues of national security. How well this new packaging is bought by the American electorate will become more evident in the coming days.&nbsp; The problem is, John Kerry's career in the Senate can always be used to rightfully belittle any claims he makes on being tough when it comes to America's defense.&nbsp; His dovish record is sterling, and is consistent with the stance he took upon coming back from Vietnam, before the recent&nbsp;onset of waffling fever&nbsp;for which there appears to be little chance of recovery.&nbsp; It is only when political expediency demands&nbsp;it that he toughens up his rhetoric.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the only way to see if he means what he says is to elect him president, which is a sociological experiment I'd rather not undertake.&nbsp; I don't have my tax shelters set up and haven't gotten around to getting a work permit in the Caymans yet.  And he did a half-Mondale.&nbsp; He did promise to raise taxes, though he said it through the more modern Democratic moniker of "roll back the tax cuts".&nbsp; His caveat, that he only intends to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, is rather subjective.&nbsp; What he means is this - once he gets in office, and sees how utterly hopeless the federal budget is, the only prudent thing to do is roll back  everyone's  tax cuts.&nbsp; The only reason I say this is that we've seen it before, in 1992, where Clinton did a conceptually similar thing, running on tax breaks for the middle class, then reneging when the opportunity to fulfill the promise arose.  &nbsp;

I'll cop out early on this one.&nbsp; The lack of privatization frustrates the rule of law, and vice versa.&nbsp; Privatization can only occur in an atmosphere where property rights are recognized and can be expeditiously enforced.&nbsp; The rule of law is meaningless for society if there is no privatization.&nbsp; The rule of law would be the state, as there are not assets for private actors to operate through.&nbsp;   Interesting question, though. More can certainly be written on it. And may be later.

      Some people are just  urlLink bad people .&nbsp; Or maybe just clueless.&nbsp; I would imagine there's some overlap here with that whole butterfly incident a few years ago   On the fourth attempt (to capture the tiger), Lee and another officer waited for a tranquilizer team to come to the scene, but when the tiger lunged toward the officers, Lee fired five rounds, according to the report. The cat was dead by the time the team arrived.    &nbsp; And the result? Instead of blanket praise that a 26 hour tiger hunt was over, and no people were hurt, the poor guy gets lambasted   Following the shooting, the agency received so many angry e-mails and phone calls -- including at least five death threats -- that some employees were urged not to wear their uniforms for a week.    &nbsp; Geeze.&nbsp; It's a tiger! A big, dangerous, on the loose, wild animal.&nbsp; I don't care how pretty it is - it would've torn off your head without thinking twice.&nbsp; Who would threaten death over a tiger? Or any animal?   Besides, I hear they make good steak.&nbsp;   Here's my  urlLink email  for those wishing to send death threats.

      Agreements have been reached, and another Arena Football team will be playing at the Gaylord Entertainment Center (the GEC) in downtown Nashville.  Because of arrangements with the Nashville Predators, they will net more from the deal than the city of Nashville, which has financial obligations in maintaining the arena.   The (Silly) Tennessean   urlLink laments  that Nashville will only make $100,000.00 off the presence of the new Nashville Kats at the GEC.  What a shortsighted story.  Do the people who write these kinds of things think? The presence of the Kats, though not as significant as a professional hockey team, draw people into the city. These people do not just go the event and leave - they stay and eat, and drink! The economy is positively affected to the tune of a few million.  The city makes money off of everything spent. The actual impact of the Kats on the city will no doubt be into seven figures.  The same goes for the Predators - the hockey team does not in a real sense cost the city anything.  This kind of thinking eludes the critics, who are, it seems, primarily composed of liberals.  Unsurprisingly, liberals (otherwise known as Gannett reporters) are not known for their economic acumen, which is peculiar because they tend to enjoy mining and pillaging the local economy for all kinds of ill-conceived socialistic adventures.

The leak was worded as "two months before the election", which would place the attack on the last day of the GOP convention when the President is slated to speak.  Eery stuff, but good to know.  Any detail is better than none, even if the information turns out to not be as precise we now think.  The stepped-up level of alert and increased security will make it difficult for any attack to take place, or in the least, could lessen the impact of the attack relative to original planning.   Those who know ask the question "when?", not "if?. There  will  be another attack - it is up to us to remain vigilant and make it harder for them to kill us.

It's exceeded in its silliness only by the naivete of its author   Military might alone has never ensured anyone's freedom or safety  otherwise there wouldn't be over 50,000 American names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall.     Is there a logical disconnect here, or a lack of logic altogether? What do the two have to do with one another? I would like for Ms. Secours to tell us all what ensures freedom and safety but the credible threat of force.  Diplomacy without military might is pointless.  That's why we don't get much sweeping change coming out of places like Luxembourg.    Her call for regime change at the end is especially touching.

      Eliot Spitzer, the self-inflated attorney general of New York, has warned the GOP not to feature 9/11 at all during its convention at the end of this month.  In fact, he  forbids  the GOP from using it...   "It would not be fair or right," the attorney general continued. "And we will not let you do it."   Why it's not fair or right is not quite clear.  Mr. Spitzer cites inadequacies in the 9/11 Commission's report. However, it is not evident why a flawed system should undermine the accomplishments and leadership of those who guided us through those dark days.   I will go out on a limb here.  I posit that Spitzer's problems are partisan.  He is distraught that everyone, from the mayor and governor of New York, to the president and secretary of defense, were Republicans on that day.  Consequently, any Democrats on the scene had to fall in line and at least pretend they were interested in the security of the United States for a few short months.  Now that time has passed.  Democrats can pretend, as they delve deeper into the world of fantasy politics, that they are more concerned with security than George W. Bush.  Rudolph Guiliani said it best   "The Democrats haven't been careful, or stopped from talking about September 11 (and) the President's reaction to it ... It seems to me you can't have it both ways," said Giuliani, who was dispatched to Boston on the final day of the Democratic National Convention to be part of a response team of Republicans who countered Democratic criticism.     Dispatched only to keep the Dems from seizing onto something they hadn't lifted a finger to claim until political expediency demanded it.  The paranoia continues   Democrats have long maintained that the Republicans picked Democrat-dominated Manhattan for their convention -- the first time it will ever be held there -- to capitalize on 9/11 and remind voters of a time when Bush's poll numbers were high. They worried the rebuilding of the twin towers was being delayed to allow Bush to be present for the groundbreaking.     Are they that insecure, or do they really have that little to offer? The question is irrelevant because the answer is the same.  Is it somehow dishonest to point to real leadership, or is it more a partisan disgust for losing the 2000 election that has the Dems so on edge?  I vote for both. Since the groundbreaking was done on July 4, 2004, the Dems have nothing to worry about but the further emphasis on substance.  I am sure they will find some way to spin this as "unfair".  Once again, the proof shows that one party is serious, and one can't escape the failed legacy of its last White House occupant.   Politics ought never come before national security, unless of course it is used to destroy George W. Bush.

      All due respect to Cher, but John Kerry is attempted to commandeer her sentiments for use in his foreign policy   Kerry repeated his argument that the Bush administration is encouraging the recruitment of terrorists. He said Bush hasn't reached out to other countries and the Muslim community.     So, what they need is more hugs. Huh.  Funny that no one living in the real world thinks that.  Kerry further elucidates   Kerry says he does not regret his vote for the war resolution, but he regrets that Bush "rushed to war" without support from more allies and without a plan to win the peace. The Kerry campaign said the president's statement was misleading.     Ah yes, the long heard, yet solely mythical "rush to war".  Need we go over this again and again?  A nonexhaustive list of allies, in no particular order  United Kingdom Poland Czech Republic Italy Spain (until it voted Democratic) Phillipines (until it voted Democratic) El Salvador Latvia  No one there, of course. Well, no one there who Saddam owed money to prior to the war, anyhow.  And then there is the ridiculous anti-Bush slant slathered all over this AP "story". Two examples   Bush challenged Kerry, who voted to give him the authority to send troops to Iraq, to agree with him publicly that ousting Saddam Hussein was the right course of action. However,  Kerry has repeatedly said that ousting Saddam was right.        Except for when he didn't.  Then there's this   On the day that Bush announced he would create a national intelligence czar and counterterrorism center to help prevent another terrorist attack, Kerry said  the self-described "war president"  was not acting fast enough to protect Americans.     Kerry's quote or the reporter's quote? They report - they decide.

      As if the attacks in Madrid and Bali weren't evidence enough, London is now officially in  urlLink al Qaeda's sights    BRITAINS security forces were yesterday put on "heightened readiness" for a potential   terrorist attack  , after detailed al-Qaeda plans to attack UK targets were uncovered.   Appeasement works oh so well.  Let the world take notice that all freedom loving countries, are, by the very raison d'etre of al Qaeda, to be destroyed.   This was our 500th post.

      Sounds good to me. The Titans are looking fantastic. SI gives good props  urlLink here . This is the best part   "Hopefully we can split things, but I know it's Chris's job at this point," [Antowain] Smith said Sunday. "My role is to come here and help him out, give him a break when he gets tired. I'm here to give him a little advice and encourage him."       Pretty good attitude for a guy with a pair of Super Bowl rings on his hand.   Shouldn't every team be clamoring for a guy like that??  No Keyshawns on our team, that's for sure. Robaire Smith start cocking a little attitude, and the coaching staff, and more appropriately, the team, came down on him.  Let's rock 'em in the AFC South!

      In light of recent polling data,  urlLink let not your hearts  be troubled   In 1988, the Gallup polls showed that Michael Dukakis was ahead of GHW Bush from late April until early August and at one time the lead was 17 points. GHWB Bush took the lead over Dukakis all the way from mid August till November election. However the Gallup polls were showing a close race between Dukakis and GHW Bush where Bush was leading by few points until Mid October were Gallup showed a commanding lead of GHW Bush over Dukakis all the way to his victory on Election Day.     This time there's a better Bush, and a taller Dukakis. All looks rosy ahead.

      Kerry's national security credentials seem to end somewhere between his returning to his homeland and denouncing the service he now proudly touts, and select words used last week in the most controlled setting.  Neither end nor the immense amount of time in between has resulted in a John Kerry who understands foreign policy or national security.  His  urlLink response  to the latest terror warning proves just that.   At least Bill Clinton was calculated and selfish - Kerry just seems negligent.  Politics used to stop at the waters' edge - with John Kerry, it never stops.

       urlLink Little Green Footballs  had awhile back put together a slideshow from 9/11. Go look at all the pics (something like 59 of them, I think).  Sometimes anger is useful, a tool to retain resolve and focus.  In the case of 9/11, we must do so for the rest of our lives.  It is a requirement for anyone at all concerned with humanity from time to time to reinvigorate and tap into that anger.

      Seems that many  urlLink in the blogosphere  have taken umbrage with Kerry's repudiation of the Bush Doctrine's requirement of selective preemptive strikes.  If it's been explained once, it's been explained a thousand times - nowadays war is not always conventional.  There will be no marches on Washington - only Ryder trucks parked on Constitution Avenue with God knows what surprises waiting to detonate.  Knowing the risks as Kerry certainly does, if we are to believe he garnered anything worthwhile from his Cold Warrior experience, and refusing to intervene anywhere preemptively is the basic tenet of a postmortem philosophy of modern nation-state survival.  If that's our tactic, we're dead on our feet.  Action only after a nuclear strike or a biological attack is a clear indicator of insanity, and holding true to that tact is a sure sign of unfitness to lead this country.  John Kerry's inability to comprehend this is alarming. Preemptive strikes are not a sign of a man who "wants to go to war", contrary to the most hackneyed Democratic argument spouted ad nauseum at the DNC.  They are instead a sign of a man comfortable with reality as it presents itself, who understands that only decisive action save lives.  We have no time for a nuanced foreign policy as viewed through a gray hued lense.  The luxury of negligence so prevalent in the security policies of this nation in the 1990s created the conditions that made 9/11 possible.  John Kerry wants to return to this time - he wants a return to 9/10.   Kerry makes fun of the administration's lack of understanding of science.  He in fact ended his speech on this point.  Someone needs to tell John Kerry to get a grip - that time travel is not possible, and his senate voting record does matter.  National security is not a game to the Republican Party, but it is to the Democrats.  I pray that the opposition party does not keep this a secret, and that the Bush campaign reveals this stark and vital difference at every opportunity.

      The latest likely voter poll from  urlLink CNN/Gallup/USA Today  (not exactly bastions of Republican sympathizers) shows absolutely no bounce for the Kerry/Edwards ticket.   In the survey, taken Friday and Saturday, the Democratic ticket of Kerry and John Edwards trailed the Republican ticket of Bush and Dick Cheney 50% to 46% among likely voters, with independent candidate Ralph Nader at 2%.    Before the convention, the two were essentially tied, with Kerry at 47%, Bush at 46%.     I thought the convention was bad, but I didn't think it would be destructive.  And the follow-up analysis   But it was nonetheless a stunning result, the first time in the Gallup Poll since the 1972 Democratic convention that a candidate seemed to lose ground at his convention.     A McGovernite result sounds good to me.

      The new budget in California has been lampooned by the  urlLink Associated Press .  Democrats are complaining about being blocked in, and that is supposed to be a bad thing.  The  urlLink LA Times  has a similar, if not harsher, take on the budget situation. But buried in the details of the article is this nice morsel   The budget Schwarzenegger signed is balanced with at least $15.6 billion of borrowing. The biggest chunk of that is $11.2 billion from the deficit bond package voters approved in March. The rest will come in several billion dollars of IOUs to various programs and a $920-million loan to make the payment into the pension fund for state workers.     First, just blame the people for the bond issue. Sure, the pain is delayed, but it will eventually have to be dealt with. To hear the governor talk about the budget, the intention is to cut state government over the duration of his term. This year's budget is indeed a quick fix. However, the IOU's to "various programs" amount to $3.5 billion.  This money need never be paid. You cannot owe yourself money, contrary to the most concerted spin.  Point is, California didn't raise taxes - a showdown is brewing.  Schwarzeneggar has purposely set up a future budget collision.  Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are happy with the budget this year.  Watch California closely - this may yet be the beginning of a brilliant political stroke by the governor.
