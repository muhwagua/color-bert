      Now it is Sunday night. I worked at Sam's Club 2:00 - about 10:00 last night, then from 11:00 am - 8:30 ( due to evening department meeting) tonight. So I'm pretty tired. I took the next 3 days off from my day job to spend with my daughter & get new school clothes and spend time with her while she has no day care this week. Next week , her school starts again! Just surfing the internet tonight and checking all my web-based email accounts. What makes all these spam emailers think I want to buy Viagra from them!

      Cup O Ramen Noodles for lunch. I should eat better. I work here in software support 6 am - 3 pm, then tonight I work at Sams Club 5:30 until they close, which was 10:00 last night, but 11:00 a few nights ago. I'm planning to quit my second job soon. When should I do it? When will I not kick myself for giving up an extra appx $700 per month? Friday, in 2 days, I get to leave the office and spend the day at a client's office , to train their new employee to use our software! Yay, I love getting out! Now I have put on the 80's music station on the radio on my desk. Funny, the 80's music station plays the same music I avoided all during the 80's. They never play Devo, Adam and the Ants, or the B52s, and rarely play anything from the Police. That's all my friends and I wanted to hear in the early 80's in high school!

      This pink background and the cute little kitties is just not me. It is very un-punk.  but I will stick with it for now. I shelled out $6 bucks for a ham & cheese croissant, fries and coke for lunch. My little 12 year old neice sent me instant messages this morning. I use trillian at my desk so I have access to yahoo, msn and AOL/Netscape Instant messenger all in one. My sn is KackyThope on all of them.

      I am sitting at my desk on the 4th floor, taking calls from software users with questions, eating popcorn, drinking my English Breakfast Tea. OK, Liptons. I ran out. I am actually listening to National Public Radio classical music station, because I am sick of every other radio station right now!

      I took training class, almost all day every week day last week, learning a new software product that our office is going to start taking customer service calls about, pretty soon. The good news is, it's a product I used to be an end-user of, 9 years ago, on a previous job. The bad news is, its had so many updates to it that it many ways it's completely new to me anyway. The other good news is that it's so similar to the product I've been supporting for the last 5 years of my life, that I really do understand how it works, for the most part. I'll just have a hard time remembering how to call up a lot of the specific options and functions that their end-users may be asking about. My schedule for this week is the same.  This week end I worked at Sam's Club again. 8 hours Saturday , 8 hours Sunday. I find that I'm more fond even than usual, of some of my co workers there. They're such hard workers and such nice people, and I'll probably be leaving them very soon. I want to quit Nov 20, so I can go to my in-laws the next week end, and spend the "Christmas season" (which as you may know, I hate, in itself) with my children (who don't hate it, and who I should be putting on a show for). Items returned for refunds? The usual ill-fitting clothes. More boxes of baby diapers than usual. A Stir-Fry cook book. Old ladies are always returning paper-back books that, once they get it home, they then figure out they already have it and have read it.  Friday night I was surfing on yesterdayland.com, in my basement, and I saw a mouse! I set a mouse trap (left over from a whole family of mice we had to kill last January) and killed him in less than an hour. Now we're setting other traps in our house to see if we kill more , but so far we haven't caught any.   Saturday all 4 of us , my husband and I, my two kids, drove to Best Buy to buy an extention cord for our VCR and DVD players, so we can network them all up properly with our TV and all our in our gorgeous, new, wooden, home entertainment center. And while we were there we picked up a little device that is supposed to repair scratches in DVD's and ROM's. This same week end I read a news story about how women in Afghanistan die in child birth because although they may now have the legal right to leave their homes, their husbands and male relatives still won't let them go to a hospital, even if they are dying! Our search for extention cords and mouse traps is just so trivial.  I am the worlds oldest sullen teen, and the worlds most priviledged woman.

      Are you tired of all those sissy, mushy "friendship" poems that always sound good but never actually come close to reality? Well, here is a series of  promises that really speaks to true friendship!  1. When you are sad, ...I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you sad.  2. When you are blue, ...I'll try to dislodge whatever is choking you.  3. When you smile, ...I'll know you finally got some.  4. When you are scared, ...I will rag you about it every chance I get.  5. When you are worried, ...I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to quit whining.  6. When you are confused, ...I will use little words to explain.  7. When you are sick, ...stay away from me until you're well again. I don't want whatever you have.  8. When you fall, ...I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.  This is my oa! th, ...I pledge 'til the end. Why you may ask? Because you're my friend!  Send this to ten of your closest friends and get depressed because you can only think of two, and one of them is not speaking to you right now anyway.  Remember: A friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body.

      Tomorrow at my software company we're having clients visit the office all week, so we have to dress up like professionals and not wear our usual software-slob-wear. Dang. I hate that.  Tomorrow I need to ask my manager, why won't she hire my friend with all his great experience in our industry? Were his references that bad?

      Put in 16 hours at the "Member Desk" at Sam's Club this week end. Unusual items returned this week end: Half a sheet cake. Ordered chocolate, was labeled as chocolate, was custom decorated. But when the customer brought it  home and cut it, it was white cake. Ate half of it, then returned the rest for an exchange for similarly priced chocolate cup cakes. (Similar to the price of the whole original cake). I wanted to ask why if they hate white cake so much did they eat half of it first, but I didn't bother. I'm going to quit soon anyway so I guess I don't really care. People returned the usual wrong-sized clothing. One guy returned a gigantic TV and a VCR. He had bought them for his daugher to take to college with her, thinking she'd drive. But she flew and could not take the items with her. So he returned them both for a refund. I spent my whole college career memorizing which first-floor dorm lounges were able to receive which local broadcast channels. My senior year, one campus facility got an actual VCR that students could use, if they could manage to get ahold of an actual video.   Weird items people have returned in the past : The Mosquito Deleto. Everyone bough one. Everyone returned them . They looked like a lantern. You were supposed to light it and leave on a picnic table near by or something and it was supposed to somehow attact mosquitos like the Death Star, and then kill them. The only mosquitos the Mosquito Deleto ever killed were those that just happened to fly in to it because they weren't' watching where they were going . So we got back all these boxes of lanterns that stunk up our corner of the store, smelling like those old Shell No Pest Strips, and also coated with real live dead, decaying mosquitos all over! Another item someone returned was a king sized mattress and box spring. Underneath their original plastic, he insisted that they smelled like fish. I smelled it. I couldn't argue with him!   One of my first days at Sams Club ever, started with a withered up old man coming to our membership desk and asking for an asprin. He was calm and pleasent, but explained he needed an asperin because he was having a heart attack. So my manager at that time ran across the whole store, ripped open a bottle of asperin from our pharmacy area, gave him one, called him an ambulence. He remained calm and pleasent. The ambulence driver told him no, he could not bring with him in the ambulence, the cake he had bought. Then the old guy threw a fit! Then just before we closed, by about 5 minutes, a lady brought a warm garbage bag full of a doughy half-baked home-made pizza. She said her pizza was ruined because the cheese she had bought at Sam's was so "moldy"! She was not impressed by my co worker reminding us all that all cheese is mold. She didn't have the receipt for any of the items she was demanding refunds for. She also demanded to be refunded the price of the other items in her pizza, bought elsewhere, because because she said our chese had spoiled the use of them. Our manager allowed us to refund her some amount he and the customer agreed was fair, but only after listeing to this hag go on for 20 minutes and argue with everyone. Then I had to throw her disgusting garbage bag full of dough and meat and cheese away in a "back dumpster" the location of which no one wanted to tell me exactly! Saddest Item any one has returned to me at Sam's Club? A bag of dog food. The dog had run away and never come back.  Well I've been taking home an extra $400 - $700 a month just to hang around with a bunch of college students, drink frozen coke, take pictures and give people their money back. It will be hard to give up the money!  Today my 8 year old daughter was listening to my husband goof around. I don't even remember what he was doing. In all seriousness she said to me, "I'm surrounded by a WEIRDO!" I didn't argue with her.

      Recent emails between me and all my old high school friends (we all, but 1, graduated hs in 1987)  Dear Roberta, Kathy, Tim and Gary,  I have been enjoying the slew of Sci-Fi and Fantasy movie critiques (and the Yoda Song) that have been sent my way these past few weeks.  Thank you!  It is great to be almost John Lennon's final age and to relate to the fun things in life.  I am certain that all of us fit under the "Cool Aunt/Cool Uncle" title when our nephews and nieces think of us. (Roberta, your work station sounds like a haven!!!!!!)  However, in all of this movie discussion, no one has ever mentioned BLADERUNNER.  Tisk-tisk!  How could any Star Wars sequel, prequel or Nyquil be a success without Harrison Ford or Rudgar Hauwer!  Now for my 2 cents on TV shows;  Star Trek (with the original cast) will outlast all of the Star Wars movies combined because it's plot had so much MORE sexual tension.  Wasn't Mr. Spock was the biggest tease?  Here was Captain Kirk making it  with every bouffant babe in the galaxy, and poor Mr. Spock stuck with getting his Captain and all of the crew out of another jam...Trekkies couldn't wait to watch an episode where Mr. Spock might succumb to his human side and make a few conquests of his own.    I was on an "I Dream of Jeanie" kick all throughout my last pregnancy. The first five episodes are SO SUGGESTIVE.  Anthony Nelson is unhappily engaged to his superior officer's daughter, when his space capsule takes a wrong turn and leaves him stranded on an island until he frees a beautiful genie, named Jeanie, who rescues him.    Jeanie is disgusted with his fiancee because she (his fiancee) doesn't appreciate how sexy he looks in his astronaut suit or his AirForce uniform!  Unfortunately, as he begins to show more of an interest in Jeanie, her character becomes less cunning.  She slowly turns into a ditsy Barbie Doll genie.  The show really loses it's steam after they're married.  Too bad, it got off to a great start!  That's all for now, Bye.  When did Jeannie and Major Nelson get married?  I had no idea! -Gary   Jeannie and Tony Nelson got married in the final season of I Dream of Jeannie, due to a combination of protests from the League of Decency , or what ever their television equivalent, and their declining ratings. I always thought that it was a good move, because it allowed Tony to make of of Jeannie's wishes come true for a change, but also a bad move, because then it just became even more of a duplicate of Bewitched. They already had the evil, brunette-wig twin cousin, and allowed Boyce and Hart to be guests, they didn't need to be more alike. There's an especially funny I Dream of Jeannie, after they're married, where all the supporting characters do some kind of intervention on Tony, because Jeannie keeps refering to him as her "master" and they're afraid he's abusing her!I am not joking, I remember seeing that as a teenager. Harrison Ford or no Harrison Ford, where ever George Lucas is writing akward, stilted dialogue, people are claiming to love each other but not acting like it ( I swear to you George Lucas has never been in love, not even once!!), fatherless teen age boys are whining about being held back, ILM is making stuff blow up, lenthy POV shots let you know in advance what the video-game tie-in is going to be, and John Williams is writing the music, it's a Star Wars movie! I need a pack of stale, over-priced Red Vines licorice, just from thinking about it.  Michelle, what was that cartoon you left me a voice mail about last week ? I'd never heard of it. You were right about Freaks and Geeks reruns. I only saw one , but It was hilarious!  Not only are we all nearly John Lennon's max age, but I also remember [Our English Teacher] Jane Schwab's 40th birthday, when I was a Junior at Davis.  Love Kathy

      Today at my week -end job at Sam's Club, we were supposed to give away a free, boxed, apple pie to each person who completed a credit card application. My excellent, co worker , Brad, is cute, funny, just turned 21. Anyway he looked in one of the boxes and showed me two little fruit flies flying around in one of them! I set that pie aside, and labeled it so no one would give it away. I named our two new pets "Sammy" and "Bud." And I watched them throughout the day.  Everyone there knows that while I'm working, I always like to go to the Sam's Club cafe and order a frozen coke, or the red, minute-maid equivalent. They act worried if they see me without my drink! Except for the distraction of my little pets, the rest of the day went as usual. Just 3 of us worked the membership desk today, taking everyone's picture for their new membership card, giving them their money back for stuff they don't want or that broke. Ho hum.

      Yesterday I got an email at work. It was a bulk email sent by our national headquarters, "inviting" all employees to wear red white and blue on Sept 11. Today my husbands office did the same thing to him. My 8 year old daugher brought home a xeroxed note saying not only are children in her (public) school "encouraged" to wear red white and blue, but also they're going to have a school assemebly in which they will recite the pledge of allegiance and sing the national anthem and God Bless America. Jingoism just doesn't get any better than this. I"m tempted to keep all 3 of us home, plus our baby, just to get us all out of this and to celebrate my husband's birthday, Sept 11, free from all this insincere, embarassing group-hysteria.

      I broke down and ordered basic cable tv this week. When we first moved to New Brighton , August 1999, we ordered basic cable. In a few months we decied we couldn't justify spending almost $50 a month just for tv, so we called the cable company and told them to cut us back to this $10/mo local channels cabled to your home package. So from then on, we just got a bill for about $12/mo...but continued to receive most of the basic channels all along! MTV, Catoon Network, CNN! We were so lucky! But last week several of those channels stopped coming in! And we knew we could not call the cable company to complain about it, because we weren't paying for them. Times are better now, so we called them and said we want to order basic cable again, which now turns out to included Noggin and BBC America! Yay! Well channels 29 - 65 still don't come in, but at least now we could legitimately complain about it! A cable guy came out and said that there is a tree branch interfering with the cable. Xcel Energy is going to come tomorrow to safely remove the tree branch and repair the cable line, apparently. Yes, in this world at the brink of destruction at the hands of Dub-Yah Bush, I am still wanting my MTV! Go figure!

      I did make it to Sentor Paul Wellstone's memorial service on Tuesday night, October 29. I dropped Paul and the kids off at home and drove right back, driving towards the University of Minnesota campus. I don't know the U of M campus well enough to know where the Williams Arena is, but I was correct in thinking I'd figure it out when I got there. I was shocked that surface parking was pretty easily available. I followed the crowd to the older-looking college athletic arena. Mounted police and police and guards on foot were everywhere. Several were shooing us away from the main entrance. It had just been officially declared full as I got there, before 5:30, for a service scheduled to start at 6:30. The guards were saying there was some kind of over-flow room set up with tv's for everyone else to watch.Lucky for me, someone near me declared that if they'd wanted to watch Senator Wellstone's memorial service on TV, they would have stayed home. She just pulled open a side door to the arena, it was unlocked and un guarded. About 25 of us or more just ran in , ran up a stairwell, opened another door, and found ourselves on a balcony behind the top of the main floor bleachers, with a perfect view of the floor.  So much for increased security and bag checks!  Venon Bellcourt, who happens to be other idol of mine, was announcing songs played by a Red Lake band drum group, from a Northern Minnesota reservation. I remembered standing outside the Minneapolis Metrodome one winter day in about 1991 when the Super Bowl was in Minneapolis. I was part of a crowd gathered to protest Washington DC's poor choice of team name and logo, Vernon Bellcourt was announcing then, too! Then the crowd had hushed to listen to a little guy I'd never seen before, it took me a few minutes to recognize he was the guy we'd just elected to the Senate, speaking as emphatically as if he were still campaigning! Paul Wellstone showed up to events all over the state, all the time. That was one of the great things about him. Now Vernon Bellecourt was speaking at Paul Wellston's funeral :( Larry Long, a lefty-folk singer sang. Sounds of Blackness sang, and as they sang , tv monitors started showing close-ups of celebraties being ushered to a special VIP section to my lower far left. I'm pretty sure that's where they were, I need to get new glasses. The crowd applauded and cheered when it showed Jessie Jackson. It was good to see everyone so happy, after being so sad. They burst in to a standing ovation when the tv monitors showed Senator Hillary Clinton and former President Bill. Suddenly it was like people were paying more attention to the tv monitors than to the larger event. If I'd wanted to watch this thing on TV, I would have stayed home. It was like mass-rock-star sighting! I was afriad girls were going to start throwing panties! Al Gore, more cheering! Walter Mondale "Fritz! Fritz! Fritz!" The monitor showed a close up of Governor Jesse Ventura being seated. Half the crowd booed, half cheered. The cheers took over. The news only reports the booing part. Then the monitor showed and old man I didn't know and the crowd booed! Loudly. Not just a few people, it was like a mass-booing hysteria! Imagine coming to a co-worker's funeral, and having the other people there boo you when you walked in the door. Later I was informed that that was Trent Lott. I'm sorry, but you have every other minute of every other day to boo Trent Lott. But at a funeral? Paul Wellstone would have been appalled! Each of the people who died in the accident (except the 2 pilots for some reason?) was represented by a family member or close friend who told amusing anicdotes about that person. Much appreciated, becase I didn't know anything about most of them, and very little abour Mrs. Wellstone. The women's shelter that she founded has been re-named the Sheila Wellstone Center. More cheering. It was good to hear. Then Senator Wellstone was represented by an assistant of his, who started out talking about Paul, but ened up calling on a specific senator, by name, and telling him how he should vote. I guessed at the time that there was a valid reason for that, but I was wrong. Reading about it later, it was just a spiteful act of public humiliation. Sad. Paul Wellstone would not have condoned it, even if later on he would have gone home and laughed his ass off about it! Later I found out that even that over-flow room was filled to capacity and some people had to spend hours standing outside watching it all on some kind of jumbo-tron. The papers are all complaining about how it became a political rally, and how Paul Wellstone's grown sons and some others included calls to support Paul Wellstone's causes and support his then-unnamed Democrat-replacement when we vote in a week. Well, memorial services for incombent, campaigning sentors have very little precident, so there's really no known protocol preventing people from including one's political goals from those other aspects of the legacy of the deceased. I owe Trent Lott a letter of apology as a Minnesotan, a Wellstone supporter and memorial service attendee, for the treatment he received that night. Then if I can compose a real letter of complaint against his actual policies, I'll call or mail him about it, as opposed to publicly insulting him at a funeral. It's been interesting to read about the memorial service in the paper, and listen to people complain about it on the radio. TV and Radio stations are being criticized for broadcasting it, as it provided un-equal campaing time for the democratic party. But the memorial service for an active US Senator is newsworthy, and appropriate for broadcast, so I've written a few broadcasters who I'm aware have been particularly criticized, to tell them so. I loved Senator Paul Wellstone so much, this just hurt! I can't remember being so thrilled with any politician who was currently in office, that I would rave about him in my spare time, the way I did with him, so frequently. I've seen him at several events, some of which were his own fund-raisers of course. He certainly got around. I'd have preferred Alan Page over Walter Mondale for our new Democrat candidate, but no one asked me, and they were in a real hurry. Some Minnesotans had already voted for Paul Wellstone on their absentee ballots, and the Democratic Party is suing, I don't know, SOMEONE, because in Minnesota, votes for deceased candidates are invalid. So if someone voted for Norm Coleman on their absentee ballot, their vote counted, but if they voted for Paul Wellstone , then their vote is not counted at all! So the only MN absentee ballots, completed and returned so far, that will be counted will be those for Norm Coleman (aka Mayor Quimby). It will be interesting to see how this one will turn out! Love Kathy

      I miss Senetor Paul Wellstone so much! I cried all day Friday and all week end. Here are the places I remember seeing him: The rally in front of the Minneapolis Metrodome in 1991 to protest the Washington DC use of racist logos for their team, at the Super Bowl that year. His Fund Raiser in about 1996 at which Al Franken spoke. His Fund Raiser at about that same time, in Highland Park in St. Paul, at which actual Ben and Actual Jerry spoke, and distributed Ben and Jerry's ice cream bars. That is the only time I remember also seeing Sheila. One day around 1996 my friend and I drove past his campaign headquarters on University Avenue in St. Paul, and he was standing out in front , talking to someone very animatedly, jumping up and down and waving his arms! Martin Luther King Day Rally, January 2001. He came and spoke. His spanish-speaking daughter-in-law came and spoke at a social justice meeting that my husband and kids and I attended, also in January 2001. Paul Wellstone himself was unable to attend, as he was in Northern Minnesota meeting with our Miners who were on strike that winter. My husband Paul insists that in 1996 he and I both took the bus , several times, to some place on Highway 280 and made fund-raising telemarketing calls for Paul Wellstone, but I swear I was not there. Paul must have gone without me. He insists I was there.  I need to go back to volunteering to teach English as a Second Language. I'm not making a contribution to the community, really, these days.

      Gave notice at Sam's Club. Nov 3 will be my last day. Spent Monday 10/14/02 all day at a client's site, being on-site for reference as they upgraded to our newest HIPAA-compatible software, they kept my on my toes, going from employee cube to employee cube all day with questions.  That day, my little girl turned 9! And we had a small family party for her. Let her pick the restaurant (ARBYS??) and opened presents at home afterwards. Came back to work on Tues, yesterday and found that my favorite client lost all his data in a hard drive crash and had stupidly not kept any backup tapes!! I am sorry, but they are so hosed! It was actually a relief to be back at my desk, just taking customer calls again all day today! Sitting at my own desk with my own radio drinking my own Lipton's hot tea.

      My husband and I saw a band called Low at the Pantages Theater in downtown Minneapolis last night. They're a band I didn't think much of, by their albums, but they grew on me, live, and I loved their show. Very mesmerizing and  hypnotic music. I loved being in downtown Minnapolis and seeing so many familiar places. I loved being there after dark! I didn't like having to pay a babysitter $30 so I could go , though!  Back to work at Software tomorrow. The work load is so much, my neck is stiffening ,  just from the mental stress of it. I'm glad I quit Sam's Club, although I miss the extra money.

      Yet another version of that 80s nostalgia email:  You are an 80's child if:  *You had a crush on Jon Bon Jovi, or knew someone who did. *You know what a "burnout" is. *You wanted to be on StarSearch. (Come on, we all did) *You can remember what Michael Jackson looked like before his nose fell off. Or even when he had those freaky eyes in "Thriller" at the end of the video. *You wore a banana clip or one of those slap on wrist bands at some point during your youth. *You owned a doll with 'Xavier Roberts' signed on it's ass. *You knew what Willis was "talkin' 'bout." *You know the profound meaning of "Wax on, Wax off." *You can name at least half of the members of the elite "Brat Pack." *You know that another name for a keyboard is a "Synthesizer." *You hold a special place in your heart for "Back to the Future." *You know where to go if you "wanna go where everybody knows your name." *You thought Molly Ringwald was REALLY cool. (Was there an 80's movie she WASN'T in?) *You know what "Sike" means. *You fell victim to 80's fashion: big hair, god-awful fashion plus accessories. *You wanted to be a Goonie ("Goonies never say die.") *You actually thought "Dirty Dancing" was a REALLY good movie, but you couldn't see it because your parents wouldn't let you. *You've heard of Garbage Pail Kids. *You knew "The Artist" when he was humbly called "Prince." *You actually saw Ted Danson as the MacDaddy he played "Sam" to be. *You ever wore flourescent -neon if you will clothing...(or nailpolish). *You could breakdance, or wished you could. *You know who Max Headroom is. *You remember when ATARI was a state of the art video game system.(Remember Pong) *You own any cassettes. *You were led to believe that in the year 2000 we'd all be living on the moon. *You remember and/or own any of the CareBear Glass collection from Pizza Hut. *Poltergeist freaked you out. *You carried your lunch to school in a Gremlins or an ETlunchbox. *You wish you were alone now with Tiffany. *You have ever pondered why Smurfette was the ONLY female smurf. *You watched Jem religiously, desperately wanted those red flashy earings, wanted to communicate with some being named Synergy, or you wanted green hair like that lead singer of the Misfits. *You know what a Doozer is. *You wore biker shorts underneath a short skirt and felt stylish. *You ever had a Swatch Watch. *You actually spent countless hours trying to perfect the care-bear stare. *You had a crush on one of the Coreys (Haim or Feldman). *You remember when Saturday Night Live was funny. *You had WonderWoman or Superman underoos. *You Believed that "By the power of Greyskull, you HAD the power!"(damned straight!) *You thought that Transformers were more than meets the eye. *You know what a "Whammee" is. ("No Whammy, no whammy, stop!!") *Partying "like it's 1999" seemed SO far away.  If you can identify with at least half of this list then you, my friend, are a "Child of the 80's."

      An 80's nostalgia email that I've received, in several incarnations, several times, over the years:  You remember when Jordache jeans were cool.  You wore anything Izod, especially those windbreakers that folded up  into a pouch you could wear around your waist.  In your fifth grade class picture you were wearing an Izod shirt with  the collar up.   You know the words to any Weird Al Yankovic song by heart.  You ever rang someone's doorbell and said, "Landshark".  Three words:  "Atari", "IntelliVision" and "Coleco". Sound familiar?  You remember the days when "safe sex" meant that your parents were gone  for the weekend.  You remember "Friday Night Videos" before the days of MTV.   While in high school, you and your friends discussed elaborate plans to  get together at the end of the century and play Prince's "1999" until you passed out from partying.  You remember when music that was labeled alternative, really was.  You took family trips BEFORE the invention of the mini van.  You rode in the back of the station wagon and faced the cars behind you.  You've ever conversationally used the phrase "Jane, you ignorant slut."  You watched HR Puffenstuff as a child but now that you're older, you really understand that it would have been much better had you known  about drugs at the time.  You've recently horrified yourself by using any one of the following phrases: "When I was younger..."or "When I was your age..."or "You know, back when...".  "Schoolhouse Rock" played a HUGE part in how you actually learned the English language.  You're starting to view getting carded to buy alcohol as a GOOD thing.  You ever dressed to emulate a person you saw in either a Duran Duran, Madonna or Cyndi Lauper video.  You remember with pain the sad day when the "Green Machine" hit the  streets and made your old "Big Wheel" quite obsolete.  You honestly remember when film critics raved that no movie could ever possibly get better special effects than those in the movie "TRON".  Girls thought Sean Cassidy was dreamy and lusted after Ted, the ship's photographer, on "The Love Boat".  You freaked out when you found that you now fall into the "26 - 50" age category on most questionnaires.  Your hair, at some point in time in the 80's, became something which can  only be described by the phrase "I was experimenting".  You're doing absolutely nothing pertaining to your major.  You're starting to believe (now that it wouldn't affectYOU) that maybe  having the kids go to school year-round wouldn't be such a bad idea after all.  You ever wanted to be "gagged with a spoon".  U2 is too "popular" and "mainstream" for you now.  You ever used the phrase "kiss my grits" in conversation.  You ever remember trying to guess the episode of the Brady Bunch from  the first scene.  You spent endless nights dreaming about being the Bionic Woman or Wonder Woman or the Six Million Dollar Man.  You had ringside seats for Luke and Laura's wedding on "General  Hospital".  You remember "Hey, let's be careful out there".  You know who shot J.R.  Your parents wanted you to attend medical school but you decided it was pointless since Quincy got all the babes anyway.  This rings a bell "...and my name is Charlie.  They work for me."  You ever wanted to learn to play "Stairway To Heaven" on the guitar.  You were unsure if Diet Coke would ever catch on, after all, look at  Tab.  You know all the words to the double album set of Grease.  You ever had a Dorothy Hamill haircut.  You sat with your friends on a Friday night and dialed 867-5309 just to  see if Jenny would answer.   "All skate, change directions" means something to you.  You owned a pair of rainbow suspenders just like Mork used to wear.  You bought a pair of Vaans and wanted to order a pizza in history class so you could be just like Jeff Spicoli in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High".  You owned a preppy handbook.  You were too young to go see the "Blue Lagoon" so you just had to settle for second hand reports.  You remember when there was only PG and R....none of this PG 13 crap.  You learned to swim about the same time "Jaws" came out and still carry the emotional scars to this day.   You remember when your cable TV box had the three rows of numbers and you had to move the selector switch accordingly.  You actually believed everything Leonard Nimoy told you on "In Search Of...".  The "ABC After School Special", "My Mom's Having A Baby", actually  taught you stuff you didn't know.  Your jaw would ache by the time you finished those 'brick-size' packages  of Bazooka gum. (I preferred "Hubba Bubba")  Bo and Luke Duke.  VCR's cost $1,000.  There was nothing strange about Bert and Ernie living together.  Rotary dial telephones.  You actually believed that Mikey, famed for his Life Cereal commercials,  died after eating a packet of "Pop Rocks" and drinking a Coke.  You searched all over for the jeans with glittery designs on the pockets.  You've ever eaten a candy ring, necklace, cigarette or whistle.  Gloria Vanderbilt stretch jeans were the height of fashion.  You prefer roller skates to roller blades.  You ever thought someone was cool because they had a  "bendable" pencil.  Or because they had a mechanical pencil or painter's paints or parachute pants.  You ever had the poster of Farrah Fawcet-Majors in the one piece  swimsuit.  Or had the Farrah Fawcet lunchbox or the Farrah binder or spiral notebook.  If you ever wore Garanimals.  (Hey!!  At least my clothes matched!!)  If the phrases "Na-nu Na-nu" or "Shazbatt!" mean anything to you.  If you ever secretly practiced your moon-walk.  If you ever argued over which was better...."Close Encounters" or "Star Wars".  You remember when HBO was new and they played "Gone With The Wind"about  a million times.  You remember when MTV was new and they played "Video Killed The Radio Star" about a jillion times.  You ever thought Bonnie Tyler was a good singer.  You tried "Billy Beer".    You ever wanted a Ronco product or ever bought a K-Tel record.  You had to chew a red tablet after brushing your teeth to see how well you did.  "I'm Chevy Chase and you're not...".   "Rock-Em Sock-Em Robots".  If you know the words to Steve Martin's song "King Tut" or ever say......"Well, excuuuuuuuuussse ME!"....or "I'm a WILD and  CRAZY GUY!"  You ever "feathered" your hair.  If you ever even considered owning "Mood Rings" or "Pet Rocks".  If you remember when the televangelists were really concerned about dungeons and dragons.  "Pacman", "Frogger" and "Centipede", friendship pins, colored hairspray, Martian head bands and you can't get the word "like" out of  your  vocabulary.   This timeline appropriately describes actual events in your  life: "Star Wars" opens, you are just hitting the double digit ages and you think the creatures are WAY cool. "The Empire Strikes Back" opens, you are now in early double digit ages and you are convinced that the special effects are much better, the characters are WAY cooler and you want one of every collectible out there. "Return Of The Jedi" hits the theatres.....you  are  now a full-blown teenager and you cannot take your eyes off Princess Leia's  breasts or Han Solo's butt. The theme song to the "Greatest American Hero" still comes back to you on occasion...."Believe it or not I am walking on air, I never thought I could be so freeeee, Flying away on a wing and a prayer, Who could it be, Believe it or not, it's just me".

      Great words from Garrison Keillor in Salon.com: On Coleman supporters: I know those people. To my own shame, I know them. I'm ashamed of Minnesota for electing this cheap fraud, and I'm ashamed of myself for sitting on my hands, tending to my hoop-stitching, confident that Wellstone would win and that Coleman would wind up with an undersecretaryship in the Commerce Department.  ...To choose Coleman over Walter Mondale is one of those dumb low-rent mistakes, like going to a great steakhouse and ordering the tuna sandwich.  But I don't envy someone who's sold his soul. He's condemned to a life of small arrangements. There will be no passion, no joy, no heroism, for him. He is a hollow man. The next six years are not going to be kind to Norm.

      I can remember my 3 years of high school as if they lasted 10 years. I can remember my 4 years of college as if they lasted another 10! But the 15 1/2 years between college graduation and now? Feels like about 5 years. Until I remember all the stuff that has actually happened in between. Countless jobs & co-workers. Countless apartments and room mates. My wedding and kids and more apartments and houses. Still, its just felt like one unusually long semester!

      Funny email going around the office: ATTENTION  EMPLOYEES NEW COMPANY RULES SICK DAYS: We will no longer accept a doctor statement as proof of sickness. If you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work. SURGERY: Operations are now banned.  As long as you are an employee here, you need all your organs.  You should not  consider removing anything. We hired you intact.  To have something removed constitutes a breach of employment. PERSONAL DAYS: Each employee will receive 104 personal days a year.  They are called Saturday and Sunday. VACATION DAYS: All employees will take their vacation at the same time each year. The vacation days are as follow:  Jan.1, July 4 and Dec. 25. BEREAVEMENT LEAVE: This is no excuse for missing work.  There is nothing you can do for dead friends, relatives or co-workers.  Every effort should be made to have non-employees attend to the arrangements.  In rare cases where employee involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the late afternoon.  We will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and subsequently leave one hour early, provided your share of the work is done. OUT FROM YOUR OWN DEATH: This will be accepted as an excuse.  However, we require at least two weeks notice; as it is your duty to train your own replacement. RESTROOM USE: Entirely too much time is being spent in the restroom.  In the future, we will follow the practice in alphabetical order.  For instance, all employees whose names begin with "A" will go from 8:00 to 8:20, employees whose names begin with "B" will go from 8:20 to 8:40 and so on. If you are unable to go at the allotted time, it will be necessary to wait until the next day when your turn comes again.  In extreme emergencies employees may swap their time with a co-worker.  Both employees' supervisors must approve this exchange in writing.  In addition, there is now a strict 3-minute time limit in the stalls.  At the end of 3 minutes, an alarm will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, and the stall door will open. LUNCH BREAKS: Skinny people get an hour for lunch as they need to eat more so that they can look healthy; normal sized people get 30 minutes for lunch to get a balanced meal to maintain the average figure; fat people get 5 minutes for lunch because that's all they need to drink a Slim Fast and take a diet pill. DRESS CODE: It is advised that you come to work dressed according to your salary. If we see you wearing $350.00 Prada sneakers and carrying a $600.00 Gucci bag, we assume you are doing well financially and, therefore, you do not need a raise. Thank you for your loyalty to our company.  We are here to provide a positive employment experience.  Therefore, all questions, comments, concerns, complaints, frustrations, irritations, aggravations, insinuations, allegations, accusations contemplations, consternations or input, should be directed elsewhere.   HAVE A NICE WEEK!

      I'm trying to figure out how blog skins works so my web log will look really cute and contain all those imbedded pop culture photographs I've seen on so many others. My computer at home is still in the shop. Will get it back in the next few days. I am writing this from my desk at work during my "lunch". I have about 30 open call - tracking calls, many of which I haven't even really read throroughly. The phone keeps ringing, and I keep adding those new calls to my existing ones, without being able to work on any of them. I quit Sam's. I was sad. It was like being a teen ager again there. But I can't fit it in to my schedule any more. I'll miss the money too. I have spoken with some Minnesota Literacy council people, so I can start volunteering to teach English as a Second Language , one night a week again. I may not have 20 or sho hours a week to work at Sam's but I think I can give up one or two hours a week for a good cause. I used to teach ESL in the evenings before my kids were born. It puts my linguistics major to work.  Work sent me on a road trip to the small town of Braham Minnesota, to demonstrate our accounting software products. The drive was long, I am lucky I didn't get lost. They were pleasent, but it seemed like they weren't really impressed by the product, as I used a borrowed lap top to demostrate how people use it. So I was very surprised when I arrived back at the office and found that in the mean time they'd called and agreed to purchase our payroll product, one of the products I had demonstrated! At least my effort wasn't completely wasted. And for one brief moment I felt like income , as oppsed to over-head, like I usually do. My 9 year old girl is in Karate two nights a week now, two blocks from our house. Girl Scouts once every two weeks. Catholic Ed (husband's idea, not mine!) once a week. I hope we're not burning her out! My 3 year old is obsessed with the DVD remote and insists on taking it potty with him and sometimes sleeping with it! My voice mail at work is filling up with people who want to know why I"m not calling them back? But I can't call them back to tell them why I'm not calling them back, I have to take the next call. Or train the new person. Or drive to Braham, MN. Or visit someone who is calling me over, as team lead, for a difficult question. Can't say my life is not full!

      Spent Xmas Eve at noon, my husband, kids and I drove 5 hours to Green Bay to spend Xmas with my in-laws. 24 hours later, Xmas day, at noon, my sister in law and I drove back together in her car, because we both had to work the very next day, and neither of us can drive in the dark.  Next Jan 18 I have a confict. I have my ticket to go to Henry Rollins' spoken word show in downtown Minneapolis...but then my company scheduled its post-season holiday party for that same night, and my husband likes going to that!  Grrr.

      Admin and sales seems to have almost doubled our customer base at work. Even knowing that, they would not approve any new hires for the company until existing employees prove we can not handle the work load. Well, I think we're proving it. At least, *I* am, anyways. The phone my phone doesn't stop ringing now, and half the time its customers who want to know why I haven't returned my calls, which is because my phone doesn' t stop ringing. And I'd declare some vacation days, but no vacations will be approved until after new years, because, after all, we're so short staffed right now.  This week end, Debi and I bought our tickets to see Henry Rollins speak on Jan 18, in downtown Minneapolis! I am so excited. It will be my third time to see him speak. I have also seen him sing, twice.  The next week, I get to to take two week-night classes and a week end class to be approved to go back to teaching English as a Second Language, as a Minnesota Literacy Council volunteer, in a local community center, hopefully one night a week, like I used to before the kids were born.I hope I get to teach small classes of absolute beginner Adults like I did the last time.   On Thanksgiving Saturday we were still in Green Bay Wisc, visiting my in-laws. My father in law brought me to the Green Bay St. Vincent De Paul's thrift store and let me chashier all morning from about 9:00 until they closed at noon. A pretty good gig, since almost everything they have is an even dollar amount!   I have absolutely got to learn Spanish, though. That has to be my next project!

      Then I posted this one: We always used to go to the Capitol Theater to see movies, in the early 70's. It was only 50 cents for kids! Then in about 1974 it  burned down, terribly. It was a local disaster because it had been an original old Vaudeville Theater, and it was such a beautiful work of architecture, it was a historical landmark. While on fire, two guys actually manged to run in , pick up the opposite ends of a GRAND PIANO, and rescue it from the fire!For several years the burnt facade of the Capitol Theater still displayed the charred poster advertising "Coming Soon, The Apple Dumpling Gang." A few years later, maybe 1977, it reopened, and my mom took me and my sister to see Bob Hope do stand up comedy there for the Grand Opening! The grand opening started with the curtain going up, and nothing on the stage but the previously-rescued grand piano, with a spot light on it. Probably a very touching scene for adults. Some lady stood off-stage and acted as the voice of the piano, telling  everyone its history, about the fire and how "I" (the piano) was rescued. I was about 13 or 14 years old, so I thought it was corny.  Then just a few days later mom tood me and my sister back to the Capitol, to see Jose Feliciano! I was actually excited about that,  because I knew he was the singer of the Chico and the Man theme song!  Good Concert! As a teen ager in the late 70s and early 80s, I was active at the Warehouse Theater, I'm always glad to hear that those guys are still  at it!

      My home town is Yakima Washington. I just posted this to a yahoo message board about Yakima history: Hi, Thank you for approving my membership to this list. I moved to Yakima at the age of 2, in 1966.  I attended Nob Hill Elementary school (with its annual field trips to the Snyders Bread Factory), Wilson and Franlin Junior High Schools (now middle schools) and Davis High School. I attended the LDS churches , the one on or near 37th ave and Teiton, and the one farhter north on a street called Edgerton or Edgewood or a street that had the word "Edge" in it somewhere. I left in 1983 at age 18 and have rarely visited since. I used to take the Northern Pacific Rail Road to Tacoma, in the late 60s and possibly the very early 70s. Being so small, however, the main thing I remember is that the attendants always gave my sister and me a paper train-conductor hat to wear, with blue and white pinstripes. I attended the grand opening of the trolley line, in about 1976 or so, my mom sang it the Sweet Adeline's chorus. Seems to me that grand opening was held on or near the Eisenhower school campus. We actually believed that it would make us a tourist attraction! I remember when the downtown Yakima mall opened, and it had a B.Dalton, a Wulitzer organ store, and a gift shop called the "IN Shop". Later it included the Jolly Joker Video arcade (I avoided it, full of juvenile delinquents), and Ron's Coin and Book in the basement (including all your "gaming" needs). I loved hanging out in that mall as a teen ager. I'm sad to hear that it is being neglected now, but my mom says she's working on a project to turn it in to a charter school, which would be a great use of the space! Later, a Prairie State Bank opened downtown, and it had this weird dress code where all the female employees had to dress in pioneer dresses, and the tellers had to stand behind barred windows, as if it were an old-west bank. I wonder if it was embarrassing to work there? I always came home from school and watched Uncle Jimmy's Club House. I think all us kids in my family were on it, for our birthdays, several times! I find that one thing I miss today is the weather! It was mild, compared to here in Minnesota! I also miss the relatively-fresh, and not over-priced crab and shrimp! I get homesick for it.  I feel stupid for not learning Spanish while I was growing up in Yakima. If I'd have paid more attention, I could have picked it up from everyone around me! I honestly belived I'd never need it, and I didn't bother. Now that Spanish is more widely spoken here in MN, I'm kicking myself! Now I'll have to go out and pay for Spanish class, I guess! I stopped by Yakima about 5 years ago and was happy to see that the "Restaruant" (I forget its name) still, at that time, had that rotating hunter sign, with its rifle, shooting up the place. When ever my family took the Tieton Drive bus downtown, I used to duck when we went by that guy! Does anyone still read this Yakima messsage board/ email list? I'll post more fuzzy childhood memories of Yakima as I rememeber them.

      I found these resume bloopers on the net and thought they were funny!  "Revolved customer problems and inquiries." Just what every employer is looking for -- an expert in passing the buck.   "Consistently tanked as top sales producer for new accounts." Sales managers aren't likely to be impressed with this self-proclaimed underachiever.   "Dramatically increased exiting account base, achieving new company record." If customer accounts were leaving in droves as this statement implies, it's probably fair to assume that this candidate also tanked as a top sales producer.   "Planned new corporate facility at $3 million over budget." Every hiring manager is searching for employees who exceed budgets by millions of dollars.   "Directed $25 million anal shipping and receiving operations." Either this person is showcasing compulsively stubborn management qualities, or he has a challenging product packaging/storage problem.   "Participated in the foamation of a new telecommunications company." This job seeker was also in charge of bubble control.   "Promoted to district manger to oversee 37 retail storefronts." This is a common resume typo. There must be literally thousands of mangers looking for jobs in today's modern world. Here's a tip: Use your word-processing program's find/replace feature to quickly correct this common mistake. You can also modify your application's spelling dictionary so it won't recognize the word "manger."   "Experienced supervisor, defective with both rookies and seasoned professionals." Many of us have had a boss like this at some point in our careers, but you usually don't find them being so up-front about their leadership inadequacies.   "I am seeking a salary commiserate with my training and experience." There are a couple problems with this statement. To begin with, salary requirements don't belong on a resume. Secondly, a salary should be "commensurate" with experience (meaning proportionate to), not "commiserate" with (meaning to express sympathy for).   "Seeking a party-time position with potential for advancement." Sounds like a fun job.

      This from http://www.shirdi.org/index.htm :  Today the world is in a transitional phase.  The next war is looming large towards the end of this decade. Old order is bound to change giving place to new. The human society needs a new meaning to life and a new system. Incarnations like Rama and Krishna had brought about such transitions through wars. War is the culmination of a divine drama where the heroes of truthfulness are ultimately victorious. This macro role of the spiritual powers is going to be enacted in a more perceptible manner in the days to come. All of us understand the meaning of a war. Let us then pray to Him to have mercy. Let us pray to Him to bring about a better order where human beings and other species can live happily together.

      What follows is a transcription of some of the best signs in Washington during the peace march January 18th.  Many of them are very good!  for those who care......   Drunken frat boy drives country into ditch.  Bush/Cheney: Malice in Blunderland  Who would Jesus bomb?  War begins with 'Dubya'.  Bush is proof that empty warheads can be dangerous.  Let's bomb Texas, they have oil too.  How did our oil get under their sand?  If you can't pronounce it, don't bomb it.  Daddy, can I start the war now?  1000 points of light and one dim bulb.  Sacrifice our SUV's, not our children.  Preemptive impeachment.  No George, I said Mac Attack.  Frodo has failed, Bush has the ring.  Look, I'll pay more for gas!  It's the stupid economy.  Draft Richard Perle.  Draft dodgers shouldn't start wars.  War is sweet to those who haven't tasted it (Erasmus).  Pillow fights only.  Our grief [over 9/11] is not a cry for war.  Different Bush, same shit.  Stop the Bushit.  Just war / just oil.  You don't have to like Bush to love America.  Bushes are for pissing on.  Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld: the asses of evil.  $1 billion a day to kill people-what a bargain.  Consume -- Consume -- Bomb -- Bomb -- Consume -- Consume  What's the difference between me & God? He might forgive Bush, but I won't.  Smush Bush.  America, get out of the Bushes.  It's time to trim the Bush.  Pro-lifers:  Wake from Bush's propaganda spell  Don't make me come back here [to a peace rally] again.  Disarm Bush too.  Big brother isn't coming-he's already here.  Empires fall.  An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind (Gandhi).  Impeach the squatters.  Mainstream white guys for peace. (Sign held by three mainstream-looking white guys)  Hans Blix-look over here.  Let Exxon send their own troops.  Curious, George? -- get a clue.  Destroy Florida. [It could happen again]  There's a terrorist behind every Bush.  How many bodies per mile?  SUV owners roll over for terrorism.  We can't afford to rule the world.  War is  so  20th century!  9-11-01:  15 Saudis, 0 Iraqis.  While you were watching the war, Bush was raping America.  Don't waive your rights while waving your flag.  Leave Desert Storm to the desert.  Drop Bush not bombs.  Fighting for peace is like f___ing for virginity.  Bush is to Christianity as Osama is to Islam.  I asked for universal health care and all I got was this lousy stealth bomber.  America's problems won't be solved in Iraq.  War is not a family value.  2 sided poster, one side has a picture of a chubby feline, with  the words: GOOD FAT CAT other side has a picture of Cheney, with the words: BAD FAT CAT  Colorfully dressed drag queen carrying a sign that says:  I  am  the bomb.  Picture of the peace symbol:  back by popular demand.  A picture of Bush with a red-stained upper lip: Got blood?  A picture of Bush saying "Why should I care what the American  people think? They didn't vote for me."  A picture of Bush saying "Ask me about my lobotomy."  Beneath a picture of Osama bin Laden dressed as Uncle Sam: I want YOU to bomb Iraq.  Beneath a picture of a menacing soldier pointing his rifle/bayonet toward the viewer   : Say it! One Nation under God. Say it!

      I let my husband and kids attend  my husband's Catholic Church without me, today. I attended a Unitarian Church in our neighborhood, where I should be going in the first place. A local attorney and member of the ACLU spoke for a good 1/2 hour about how the hijackers of the flights that were downed on Sept 11 2001 , and their supporters, are criminals, but not representatives of the militaries of their respective home countries. That Pres Bush and his supporters are using that event as an excuse to erode the civil rights of all americans, but particularly arabian and muslim Americans and guests; and that we need to be more vigilant about what other laws are being passed and revoked while the political right is distracting everyone's attention away from any non-terrorism-related issues. Lacking, as is too often the case, was any suggestion about what we as American Citizens should do about it.

      No big updates, except we got a dog. Abby. 1/2 German Shephard, 1/2 Spaniel. 2 year old female. We got her fixe right away. The humane society we found her at said if we did not get her spayed in 30 days, they would come take her back, and fine us $500 ! Now I come home from lunch to let her out of her kennel and walk her, then drive back to work, so essentially I don't really get a lunch.  My 3 year old son's day care told me, a few weeks ago, that they were going to start charging my son the old, toddler rate, a more expensive rate, because he has to many potty-training accidents, more than the other kids and at a later age. Next day my husband asked them to show him where in our contract we signed last September, did it say we'd pay a higher rate if not fully potty trained by a certain point, and they reversed the decision. Thank heavens.  About 2 weeks ago  , he pulled the fire alarm on our way out of his day care, and the owner had to call the police to get it turned off! Yesterday it was the going-away party for somone in the company that I barely know, but I arranged to go anyway. I convinced my husband to leave work early enough for him to pick our kids up, and I got to go out for drinks with my co workers. They had beers, I had 2 cokes, because I don't drink. I loved being able to go out with people!

      Do you feel this way about Star Wars III ? I do.  This pasted directly from bbspot.com  Thursday,  February 20 12:01 AM EST  Man Hopes Episode III Doesn't Ruin His Childhood       By Brian Briggs     Phoenix, AZ - Lance Hymer, 31, like many of Generation X, is eagerly awaiting the final chapter of the Star Wars saga, and like the rest he's worried that Episode III may ruin his childhood.   "I have a lot invested in the Star Wars movies, and I don't mean financially like my friend Ted. I mean in here," Hymer said pointing to his heart. "When I saw Star Wars for the first time I was like 'wow.' When Empire came out I was like 'double wow.' Those were the greatest times of my life, and now that's all in jeopardy."  Episode I and Episode II filled Hymer with dread. He could feel his idyllic memories slipping away. "I'm worried that through some plot twist Episode III could entirely alter how I feel about the original trilogy. What if the Jedi turn out to the bad guys? What if there really is no 'force?' It could alter my reality in an awful way."  Hymer isn't the only one concerned. His neighbor, Hans Oloman, isn't worried about his childhood, but about his "golden years." Oloman has over $300,000 in Star Wars memorabilia stored in his basement, and plans to sell the merchandise to finance his retirement. "A really bad Episode III could mean all my years at yard sales and on eBay could've been in vain. I might be living in this giant AT-AT on the street instead of the Shady Acres Golden Village. Do you want that on your conscience Mr. Lucas?"  Demographers fear another "lost generation" if Episode III stinks. "Generation X is perched on the edge of the Sarlacc's pit and something as ruinous as a Star Wars failure could push them right in," said Dana Phillipe from the Make It Good Foundation.  No one is certain what George Lucas might put in the final film. Rumors of a Jar Jar/ewok love scene and a musical scene involving Emperor Palpatine have fans of every generation on edge.  Gloria Wilkens from Lucasfilms said, "Mr. Lucas realizes how important the films are to millions of fans around the globe and appreciates their concerns. That is why he's taken even more control of Episode III than any of the other films."  "Nooooooooooooooo..." sobbed Hymer.

      I just posted this message on Memory Lane http://priest.proboards17.com/ It is true, too!  "Over 2 months ago, my husband and two little kids scoured all the Humaine Societies in our area, looking for a dog they could all agree on. They chose a 2 year old female German Shepard/Spaniel mix.  So she's been with us for over 2 months now. Very affectionate and energetic. I've pretty much ruled her out as a guard dog, unless standing on your hind legs and licking a stranger on his face counts an an assault.  But I feel so bad. I just don't like her. I pity her sometimes because she has to put up with our schedule in which we sleep, as a family 6 - 8 hours a night, and are gone to work and school over 8 hours a day and she is all alone in our house during that time.   But to me she's just a bio-hazard. A poop-pee-and-shed-on-my-carpet machine. I try to be nice and pet her, but I can't take getting licked all over my face by a dog and I have to push her away when she does it. Plus I keep having to take kids' toys and all our shoes and boots away from her , because she chews them.  I'm glad my kids & husband have a dog, and they love her, and she loves them and is so great with them, but I think she knows I don't like her, so , again, I pity her.  My biggest love of my whole life was one of the many dogs I had when I was a kid, whe I was pre-school age, she died when I was in Kindergarten. I hope my kids love this dog that much. But I"m sorry I just don't."

      Words from Al Franken:  Norm Coleman called me last night. After a few days of taking hits for some controversial remarks, Coleman told me he had decided to respond in more detail about the comments he made in Roll Call.   Specifically, people had been offended by this passage in the Capitol Hill daily: " 'To be very blunt, and God watch over Paul's soul, I am a 99 percent improvement over Paul Wellstone,' Coleman said . . . When pressed about the remaining 1 percent, Coleman sidestepped the issue . . . ."  On the phone, Coleman sounded anguished. "I believe I owe it to the people of Minnesota and to Paul's soul to explain that other 1 percent where Paul was definitely better than me."  "Yes, I was curious about that," I told him.  "Well, for one thing, I guess you'd have to say passion. Paul was definitely more passionate than I am. Which I think came from his deep conviction," Coleman explained.  "So passion and conviction?" I asked.  "Yes. And probably authenticity. That was an area where I'd have to say he was head and shoulders above me. I mean, let's face it, Paul Wellstone was the real deal."  "So authenticity too?"  "Yeah. Paul was genuine. As I say, that's something I could use some work on," Coleman admitted.  "So we have passion, conviction and authenticity, right?"   "Yeah. You know, now that I hear it coming from another person, I'd have to say that's more than 1 percent. I'd give those 3 percent," Coleman conceded magnanimously. "So, come to think of it, I'm probably just a 97 percent improvement over Paul."   "How about humility?" I asked. "That was one quality I really liked about Paul."  "Oh, sure, I'd have to give you that one. You know, let me revise these numbers. Because Paul was also just a lot nicer than me. That's why people loved him so much."  "Yes, they did," I agreed.  "So, I think we're looking at me being just, oh . . . let's say an 88 percent improvement. Give or take."  "You know, Norm," I said, "I think one of the reasons people loved him so much is that they knew he cared about them."  "True. Cannot argue there. I think we're down to about 83, 84 percent."  "Caring about people is pretty important, Norm."   "OK. But high 70s, and that's it."  "How about independence? If Paul was anything, he was independent."  "OK. But is that really better? I mean, having a senator the president can depend on is good not just for Minnesota, but for me. The White House is sending me all over the country, doing fundraisers and such," Norm said excitedly. "I'm hot! And that's good for Minnesota."  "Norm, I'm going to put another one on the table, but I'm afraid you might get offended."   "Oh, don't worry. I don't get offended easily. See, that's an area where I'm so superior to Paul. He'd get offended at the drop of a hat. Injustice, poverty, you name it. So, go ahead, shoot."  "Well, it's just that I think Paul had more integrity than you."  There was a pause at the other end of the phone. Maybe I had gone over the line. It must have been 30 seconds before I heard his voice again.  "Sorry, Al. I just got a message on my BlackBerry from Karl Rove. Guess which Minnesota senator is going to Camp David this weekend?"  "I'll bet it's not Mark Dayton."  Coleman laughed. "Good one, Al. You know, I don't think Paul was ever invited to Camp David."   "You're probably right."   "See? That's an improvement right there!" Norm said. "Now, what was that thing you thought I might be offended about?"  I paused. Then, gingerly, said, "Integrity."   "Right." he said without hesitation. "You know, that one had totally skipped my mind. So, in summary, what do we have?"  I rattled them off. "Passion, conviction, authenticity, humility, caring and integrity -- since we're not counting independence."  "Yeah. But I think we're missing one."   I racked my brain. "Compassion?"  "Well, isn't compassion really just a combination of caring and passion?" Norm said.  I had to give him that. "OK. How about honesty?"  "No. I think integrity covers that. I swear we're missing one."  "Decency?"  "It's like that. C'mon, we said it. It's on the tip of my tongue."  I was stumped.   "This is killing me," Norm said. "It had something to do with humility."  It hit me. "Niceness?"   "Bingo! That's it. Paul Wellstone was a nice guy."  "Yeah. He sure was."  "So, I'm going with 68. I'm a 68 percent improvement over Wellstone. That's still a big improvement."  "Yes. Yes, it is. Norm, can I ask you a question?"  "Sure, Al."  "Besides lack of independence and ability not to be offended, can you tell me another area where you're an improvement over Paul Wellstone?"  "Oh, that's easy," Coleman said. "I'm very smart."  Al Franken is a satirist and native of St. Louis Park. His next book, "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them," which he describes as "a fair and balanced look at the right," will be out in the fall.

      I posted this to marco-pirroni.co.uk on Aug 25, 2003.  2 week vacation hightlights.  36 hour Amtrak ride from St. Paul, Minnesota to Pasco, Washington, with my husband and two small children, uneventful except for passing some raging brush-fires we passed right by, in Eastern Washington State. All that's between Minnesota and Washington, was mostly dirt, dry, desert, except for the beautiful Glacier National Park in Western Montana. Very scenic with its mountains and evergreen trees.   Our train seats were recliners, we slept in them.   Spent 7 whole days with my parents, in my home town of Yakima, Washington. Both 59 years old, still married after 40 years...merely living in entirely separate sections of the house, as are most of the still-married parents of most of my other friends my age. 5 of my 6 brothers and sisters still live in town, in fact 2 of them are back living with my parents. One brought his wife back with him. So they were all 5 in and out of the house, with or without spouses, at any hour of day or night, with all their children, as well as the 4 of us, visiting, and my 2 parents.   I was sorry to find that the two siblings I have who have NOT been diagnosed with mental illness, compensated by marrying spouses who MUST BE, including this brother in law who is wearing this same shirt in all his pictures I came back with...      In case you can't tell, it is a picture of a guy getting a blowjob by a fish.   I attended my 20 year high school reunion. It was great for me to see so many people again after 20 years! Especially my best friends from that time, who used to hang out with me & listen to the B-52's, Devo, and the Police. Me and two other girls were voted "least changed." The other two really did look like they were still 18, and had been frozen in time since June 1983, but I really have no idea what I was doing up there with them.   I took my kids up Mt. St. Helens. They're bored by my reminding them I lived 80 miles downwind of it when it errupted in 1980 when I was 15, and our whole town was covered in ash. Ho-hum, volcano stories from old people.   [img]http://hometown.aol.com/kackythope1/images/mtsthelens.jpg[\img] I am holding my son, my daughter is sitting on the sign, and my sister is wearing the black "Patrick" tee shirit. You can see what's left of the volcano, behind my daughter's head.   I drove the 4 of us plus my mom to visit my 6th sibling, in a neighboring town, in the "Adult Residential Treatment Facility" to which the State of Washington has committed him. He's so drugged up it was like visiting Forrest Gump. When I talked to him on the phone before we visited he said, "I'MSOEXCITEDTOTALKTOYOUMYMOUTHJUSTDRIEDALLTHEWAYOUTANDMYTOUNGEHASSWOLLENUPTO4TIMESITSNORMALSIZE!"   I've never eaten out at so much fast food restaurants so many times in 7 days, in my whole life.   36 hour train ride back. Came within 20 miles of a forest fire in Western Montana, we could smell the s'moke (intentionally misspelled to avoid the emoticon) from inside the train, & see the fog out the window. Immigration boarded our train car as I was sleeping, and took the Spanish-speaking lady, seated directly behind me, away in a van!!

      OK I charged the Amtrak tickets. We never did receive any checks from that supposed child tax refund program. And our neighbor with 6 children says she only received thirty four dollars total, instead of the 400 per child that the newspaper keeps saying everyone is going to get! Tuesday night at 11:15 we get on an Amtrak train and ride for about 36 hours to Pasco Washington. How we'll get from Pasco to Yakima, no one knows. Probably rent a car. We'll be at my mom & dad's for a week, leaving the following week on Wednesday night. Of course, staying at my parents' usually meant carving out a niche in the clutter and ducking out periodically to eat at Burger King a lot . I'm glad we're going. Last time my parents saw my 9 year old daughter, she was 3, and they've never seen my 4 year old son at all. And my kids will get to ride on a train & see the Pacific Northwest the whole way!

      At my desk, at work, it's 1/2 hour past when I was officially back from my lunch. I spent all lunch figuring out mixedrace.com does not really allow remote-linking of avatars. I loaded 2 small pictures of myself, scanned yesterday, to my mixedrace.com web site, then remote-linked to them from 2 different discussion lists I'm on. In each case one minute you look at my post on the discussion lists, you can see my picture, then later come back and you just see a red x.  I need to find a new host site for avatars and remote picture linking, and it needs to be a free one. And I'm too vain to ask everyone else for help. I can see in the "properties" of their photos that they all have some obscure site that they're probably paying for, to host thier scanned photographs for that purpose. I'll find a way around this. I got to keep on top of what ever play-technology today's average 12 year old can figure out, because 10 years from now marketable technology will be based on that underlying programming logic, and I will be competing with that same former 12-year-old for my job.

      Jargon Spewing Corprate Zombie.  I've been looking in on marco-pirroni.co.uk and adam-ant.net quite a lot lately, chatting to cool people over those forums. Love Marco. Sorry Adam's ill.  Still work 6 am - 3 pm M-F and the occasional Saturday, at the software company. But am significanly less motivated than I used to be. About a month ago, we had a meeting in which it was explained to us by some executive that all the executives received their corporate-goal-reaching bonuses anyway, even though we as a corpopration only met 80% of our annual goal. Because of course we want to retain them, we wouldn't want to lose their excellent leadership.  Meanwhile there is a 4% raise-cap this year for everyone else, and to get it you'll still have to meet your manager's expectations (apparently not just 80% of them) . Because of course we wouldn't want to be like all those other software companies that gave all their staff huge raises and then had to declare bankruptcy and lay all those people off. Just a few weeks earlier we all got an email saying that in order to save money, our reception area would no longer be subscribing to any magazines, so would we please bring magazines from home, so that our customers and guests will have something to read while they're waiting? Which of my magazine back-issue collection do you think I should bring in: Phsychotronic Video; Giant Robot; or Bitch Magazine? Anyway I'm putting in as little effort as possible these days and checking the internet a lot, because I think our networking dept is just as understaffed as we are, and probably has better things to do than to check up on me.  Plus they still won't hire my friend Jeff who would be perfect, so I hate them right now.  I have been in total dental agony all summer, and have just returned from my 6th dental appointment in about 2 months. Hopefully it will be my last until January. Now I have two new fillings and a crown. I will get another crown on another tooth in January. Ive already met my dental annual max this year, so that other tooth will have to wait until the year starts over.  I'm also freaking out because my husband and 2 children are planning to visit my parents next week, which means getting all 4 of us from Minnesota to Washington State, somehow, and back again. My husband and I have asked off 2 weeks from work, for the trip. But I'm depending on the George Bush child care credit tax refund, which I object to on principal, but will use anyway, for this trip. I vote for Greyhound because it will be cheaper, but my husband votes for Amtrak, which would BREAK US, but he's such a comfort-baby. We still dont' have someone to take our dog, and will probably pay to have her kept in a local professional kennel.  It will be my 20 year high school reunion! I still love my old high school friends so much! But some of them are still so bitter about high school, and about something that happened at the 10-year reunion, that some of them have said they'll come to town to see me, but they're not going to the official reunion at the hotel on Saturday, or to the picnic the next day. Sometimes I still miss sitting in each others' basements & bedrooms, listening to Devo, the B-52' s and the Police, on vinyl and cassette.   Marco Pirroni posts messages to Marco-Pirroni.co.uk all the time, and recommended a fascinating book called "Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music" by Irwin Chasid. So I got it and my husband and I are both completly obsessed with it now. Here is a quote from the Wild Man Fischer chapter, that has just haunted me, " When you're immersed in alternative, post-glitter, underground punk culture, there's humor about certain things that aren't actually funny." This was in reference to an artist who really was mentally ill and a danger to himeself and others.   Love Kathy

      Thursday Day IV  Last week when our manager announced that we would be celebrating Customer Service week "next week" but that there wasn't much of a budget for it and it would have to go for more people than usual, I said, in front of everyone, "So , in other words, its just a big pot-luck, is what you're saying." She laughed out loud and didn't stop for a long time.  I felt sorry for her on Monday when they passed around the pot luck sign-up sheet.  Today was the pot-luck. I ducked out just before lunch and bought Chinese fried rice and it seemed to go over pretty well.  Earlier to day, we all set out our jack-o-lanterns. Doris's boyfriend substituted his own personal good pumpkin for the smaller, misshapen one the company sent Doris home with. He even shaved jagged eyebrows in to it, it is so cool. And unlike the others, it does not look like it came from a stencil. During our pot luck lunch, the company receptionist had all the jack o lanterns all over the lobby, and they were lit, and she had dimmed her lights. It looked and smelled really great. When we were given our pumpkins I could SWEAR Dan M said don't include the name of your tribe anywhere on it, so everyone could vote impartially . Of course everyone just voted for the one they knew was their own tribes'; plus some tribes DID carve the name of their product right in to the pumpkin. The Tribal Council (managers) will vote as tie breakers if the votes are too close.   This afternoon I was handed our team's scavenger hunt list: 1) Compass/Sundial 2) Chap Stik 3) Magnifying Glass 4) A Survivor Manual 5) A Bar of Soap 6) Binoculars 7) Duct Tape 8) Sun Screen /Tanning oil 9) 10 Feet of Rope 10)Wooden Matches 11) Bandages 12) Flotation Device 13) Safety Pin 14) Flashlight 15) Fishing Device 16) Antacids 17) Bug Spray 18) Antibiotic Ointment 19) Asprin 20) Canteen  As of now, between everone on my tribe, we have all but the Compass, Binoculars, Matches, Bugspray. But I've heard other teams say they have EVERYTHING already. The locker room in our basement had an unusual amount of ladies in it as I raided all the unlocked lockers, looking for a bar of soap to "borrow", but it was worth it because I got a bar of irish spring, still in the box!  Also, as I write this, out in the hall by the elevator, they're holding a coctail weenie eating contest. Each tribe was supposed to send two eaters, but only one of us was willing to go. The rest of us don't like coctail weenies and don't want to get sick.  Dan M sent me the "Email Tag" email today. Each I sent it to one member of my tribe, with my designated trivia fact about the Advantage product, and I think we did a great job of notifying each other as the email passed from one person to the next. Amy C even had to go to Kevin G's computer and receive, and then send his, as if it were from him, because he was away, in a meeting.  That afternoon , Dan M, the main person pulling Customer Service week together, very timidly asked me if I thought people were really enjoying the activities. He's such a cute little guy, how could I say no this sucks? So I said yes I thought everyone was. I left out the part where I ridiculed it several times  a day, on my web log , from my desk at work.  Friday Day V  Email from Dan M:  "The Medallion has been found by Tribe Member - Travis Dye of the EDI Tribe.  Congratulations EDI.   The VitalWorks Fright Walk is taking place today in the front lobby at 10:00am.  You may vote for the best costume, the voting box will be placed in the break room.  We are going to add an addition 100 Pts to the Tribe Member with the best costume.  In addition, each Tribe will receive 10 Pts for each employee who is wearing a costume.  Voting will be closed at Noon.      The Touching/Feeling test will take place on B1 starting at 10:30-11:30.  20 Pts for each item you guess correctly.  You do not have to attend unless you want the points.     The Ice Cream Social will take place at 2:00pm in the break room.  At this time, we will announce the winning Tribe and distribute prizes.  All Tribes will receive prizes, so please plan on attending.   The Tribe Counsel has a great time planning all of the challenges for the week.  We appreciate everyone who participated and we hope you all enjoyed yourself during our Survivor - VitalWorks Employee Appreciation Week.   LAST CLUE (Just for fun.) Fridays Clue  Have you figured out all the clues? They all point to the same place on 4th floor.  1. Survival Substance  2. An object to simplify a task  3. A place to get CAKE.  Now, within that space find this item. It will lead you directly to the prize!"  We had a costume contest that day. I dressed as Hermione from Harry Potter, because I have the hair for it, and bought a Hogwarts robe from Target last year. We had plenty of animals and pirates. One tribe all got under one blanket and walked around single file, claiming to be a "caterpillar." The best costume was rigged by Tom K, also on another tribe, who rigged one of those costumes to make it look like he was riding on the back of a midget. My personal favorite was the guy who just wrapped some tin foil around his head and put a sign around his neck that read "stop reading my thoughts."  At lunch, we had that pot luck I had made a smart-ass comment about the week before. And our front desk receptionist, the kindly old lady she is, dimmed the lights in the reception area and lit all the jack o lanterns, which we all know is against the fire code, but we did it anyway. It smelled great in there. Even though there was a rule stating you can't display your tribe's name next to your jack-o-lantern, some people carved their tribe's name right in to it! Doug V. , leader of his tribe, went so far as to stand in front of the display, wearing a button that read "Vote Early Vote Often" and canvassed very professionally for votes for his tribe's jack o lantern. I have no idea who won but it sure wasn't us.  That morning the "medallian" was found...by my boss's boss's boss! The Director of Client Services Travis D found the medallian and gained numerous points for his tribe.. It turned out that the "mediallian" was a xeroxed picture of a medallion, and was located in a picture frame hanging in our break room, sandwitched in between the picture and the back-matting of the frame! One of our receptionists told me later that she didn't appreciate the valdalism inherent in the medallion search, what with people tearing apart office equipment in there, rummageing through storeage, opening unopened boxes, and finally having the medallion be in a place that required further vandalism to get to it.  My team came in 2nd-to-last, over all, for customer service week, in spite of all our effort.  The Tribal Coucil gave every tribe leader an envelope with several lottery tickets, to share with the whole tribe. Some tribes just considered it one big pot of lottery tickets and scratched them all off together. But I divided mine up among everone, because it was too hard to get everyone together.  I got extra lottery tickets for sending so many email compliments, but I just passed most of them back out to my tribe, so that the math would work out to every member getting 2 lottery tickets.  My last email out:  Advantage Tribe,  One last email from me. "Sorry all my excellent leadership ranked us 7th of 8, but we all got lottery tickets out of it. Everyone got 2. Most people,I have handed 2 lottery tickets to you, or put them in a desk drawer of yours, or on your desk, but Tawny A, Sharon G, and Vonda D, please come to me as I don't know where you are & I want to give you your tickets.  You are all the greatest team mates I could have, and I can't wait to see the "pie" pictures.  Kathy W"  And one last one from Amy C: "I'm not one for 'dorky office stuff' but I do have to say this week was pretty fun.  Kathy was a GREAT leader, and an even better sport when we were all throwing pies at her.    Thanks for being my team."   In case you didn't notice , I secretly got way way in to it as we went along. I really liked coming in to so much contact with employees of this company that I don't work with closely on a daily basis, and in many cases I had never met before!

      Wednesday Day III  The company actually sprung for bagels this morning!  Tribe Advantage is in the middle of the pack today, as far as points accumulated! We won some points yesterday when Dan M collected all the tribe leader necklaces, he said it showed creatvitity that I tied knots in teh twine for several of my beads. I did not point out that I had to do that becase I was running out of beads and I needed to spread them out. We're supposed to send emails to compliment other people in the office. If you send an email "employee appreciation" comment to someone and CC it to Dan M, then your tribe gets 5 points and that person 's tribe gets 5 points. Of course if you do it within your own tribe, you get 10 points, so we should really get cracking. Now I'm being called in to a tribe leader meeting even though once again it is my lunch hour.  OK I'm back from the "meeting." Dan M handed each of us our teams' pumpkins, one each, and then explained "the company would appreciate it if you didn't carve it here." Which is to say for this office-related contest, worth 50 points to our tribe, the company would prefer we risk injury at home, rather than risk injuring ourselves at work.  The most recent email:   "Hello Survivor Members, we hope you are enjoying the competition.     Thank you to all who participated in the Pie Throwing Contest, some of you really got "creamed."   Updates:       Your Tribal Leaders have been given pumpkins for the carving contest.  Your Tribe has 24 hours to complete the challenge.  The pumpkin challenge is a HOMEWORK challenge, please do not do the carving during company time.  All Members of the office will vote on the best carved pumpkins, which will be displayed throughout the office tomorrow.  A voting box will be in the employee break room.  Only one vote per employee PLEASE!   The Quiz and the Brain Teaser challenges will take place tomorrow.  Sorry for the scheduling error.     The E-Mail Tag game has not been started for any Tribe at this time.  This challenge could take place at anytime.  This encourages you to stay at your desk.  For all of the Tribe Members who are NOT in the office, points will NOT be deducted for their absence.       Tomorrow is the Pot Luck, we encourage you all to participate, the sign up sheet is located in the break room.  Don't forget about VitalsWorks first ever - Mini Weenie Eating Contest.  Tribes, pick your best eaters.       Clue #3   Your objective lives within sight of yesterday's lead; however here is another piece of data you might need. It makes your task less complex, single sided or duplex, in this area you'll want to search next.     DanM"  I just tore apart both  copy machines in our office, both of which happen to also be near coffee stations, but I saw nothing unusual. Now I can see everyone else has the same idea as me. Now they're all dismantling and looking around both copy machines too.

      Yesterday afternoon we got an email clue about the location about a hidden "medallion." It read:  "This stimulating elixir, made in a number of places on our floor, is a daily survivor need for most of us. Find the right source for it, and you will be close to where your prize is hidden."  We all headed for all the coffee stations and looked in, on , around, and under everything in those areas, but so far no one found any medallion. At about 2:30 some of our tribe and some of another tribe went downstairs to the loading dock that also doubles as most people's smoking lounge. First the other tribe leader, my closest co worker, Chima O, stood behind a tarp hung from the ceiling, with a bullseye target painted on it, and a hole cut in the middle, for his face. Next I did the same. Our senior manager made "pies" by spraying Redi-Whip whipped cream in to paper bowls or paper plates, and three members or our tribes took turns throwing 3 pies each , trying to hit us in the face. Mine had a tendancy to hit my head rather than my face, or hit the target just above my head so that it fell from there on my head. I was disappointed this morning to come in and see the results. We were still beat by two other teams! Oh, someone in my department just called me on her cell phone to say she'll have to be late today, because on her way here, she remembered she forgot her necklace!

      VWorks Customer Service Week Oct 27  Oct 31, 2003  Theme: Survivor  Traditionally I look forward to Customer Service week. The company usually caters some breakfasts,  lunches, and snacks for our department that week. It usually gives out small souvenirs, such as cups or pens with the company logo or some official customer service slogan on them, and arranges a few games for us to play that can be dropped in on at any time during breaks. The call center I work in is always busy, and its not realistic for any of us to be expected to leave their desk at some designated time.   This company now has about 150 employees. It has both grown and had a tremendous amount of turn-over in the course of the last year or so. This year a new administrator decided that it wouldnt be fair to limit customer service week to just the customer service department, and that the entire company should be included this time. A team of 10 people, mostly managers, met to discuss how the small customer service week budget could be used to cover all employees. They apparently decided that it would somehow increase morale and cooperation, if we adapted the them of the tv reality show Survivor,. Having never actually watched Survivor, isnt it about people who alienate and sabotage each other.? We were randomly divided in to 8 tribes  of about 12 people each. Each Tribe is named after one of the software products that our larger corporation sells and supports.   A paragraph from the original memo reads:  The Senior Executive team along with the planning Committee that has been assembled, has determined that we will recognize this event as VWorks Employee Appreciation Week because of the significant contributions of all of our employees   Monday Day 1  12 of us were called away from our desks for 30 minutes, during an appointed time that happened to be during  of my lunch hour. I recognized 4 of them, .including one I knew from a previous office but had just been hired here last week. The manager of my own department, and a woman I had never seen before, but later turned out to be a new manager in another department addressed us. The stranger never introduced herself to us, I only found out who she was, later. They both handed us a brown paper bag with one bag of chips, a juice box, a bite-sized Snickers bar, a small packet of cookies, and a Halloween toy, mine was a plastic pumpkin ring. That was the treat advertised in the email telling us what time to meet. The stranger handed out string, plastic beads, and a small box of dry ring-o-noodles. We were told that all the other tribes were being given the same kind of beads, but different kind of macaroni shells. All week, our tribe MUST WEAR the necklaces we were making. And if at any time a member of this planning committee saw any of us not wearing our necklace from the beginning of our scheduled start-time to the time were scheduled to leave,  then our tribe would loose 5 points. Even if it during our break or lunch. Even if we leave the building during lunch and they see us there.  The mostly-managerial organizers of the event are wearing elaborate necklaces made of twine and real sea-shells.  The managers told us we have to choose a tribal leader. She did not say what function the tribal leader would serve, just that we had to select one. Few of us there knew each other at all. One lady there who knew only two people in the room, suggested one of them, and she declined. Then she suggested me, and I agreed. I assure you I agreed out of a sense of sick fascination. The stranger then turned the page on our agenda to page 2 and announced that one day this week will include a pie-throwing contest, I quote from the agenda:  Your tribe has now determined a Tribal Leader, its time to show your appreciation. Your Tribe Leader will be placed as a human target; three members of your Tribe will be give (sic) three pies. The goal RIGHT IN THE FACE. Closer you get to the Target, the more pts are given.  The lady who suggested me apologized to me as soon as the stranger read us this part. Earlier that morning, a co-worker and I had noticed that the refrigerator in the break room is full of cans of Redi-Whip. We remarked on it, and hoped that meant we were going to have an ice cream social some time this week, but now we know why all those cans of whipped cream were in there. I knew immediately that me getting a pie in the face because I volunteered to take on a mystery project, and  our company is broke, yet still in need of amusement is both fitting and symbolic. I intend to get pictures of it, to motivate me in my future job search.   I should probably add, at this point, that the reason our company doesnt have money for things like employee events, significant raises, or even product development, is because last summer our board of directors voted to give executive bonuses to the executives anyway, even though as a company we only met 80% of our sales goals. Most of the board of directors is made up of executives of our company. So essentially they voted themselves raises. One of the recipients of that bonus informed us during an all employee meeting at that time, that we had to compensate those executives, to keep their salaries competitive so we dont loose them. When asked at that same meeting, why non-executive wages were not determined that same way, he explained that thats why all those dot-coms went out of business, and all those people got laid off, thats why.  My first E-mail to the tribe, as Tribal Leader:  Good Morning All,  This email includes the names & email addresses of all the members of our Customer service week Advantage Tribe. Saving this email will allow us to "reply - all" & email everyone at once, at any time.  My name is Kathy W and I was named Tribal leader at this meeting. I have worked for VWorks for over 6 years, in the client support department, and had 8 years of medical business office experience before that.  We met at 11:30 in training room 118, absent were Jean H and Kevin G. I have delivered necklce-makings to Jean & talked to her in person, but have had to leave those items for Kevin G on his desk as he is not in the office.  Linda M and  Chris B handed us all some string , and some plastic beads and small macaroni shells with which to make necklaces. Once half way through making these necklaces, Chris B informed us that we must also somehow incorporate the name of our tribe "ADVANTAGE" in to this necklace, but that we would be allowed to add some outside element to the necklaces to do so, as long as we were consistant. I have at my desk some blue cards with the word "ADVANTAGE" on them, and some paper clips. Some of us have already added our name-cards to our necklaces. If you haven't, please stop by my desk in client-support and I will give you one of these cards to add to your necklace.  Chris B informed us all that if she or Linda M or any other of the organizers of this event see us at any location during our regularly scheduled hours , without this necklace on, the team looses 5 points, so please create and wear your tribe necklace by tomorrow morning, as that is the start-time of the necklace-wearing event.  Kathy W   Another game coming up is going to be called email tag. Description: A time has been designated for your Tribe by the Tribe Counsel Host. An email will be sent to your Tribe Leader, this will indicate the start of the game. It is the responsibility of the Tribe Leader to send an email out to one member of the Tribe; in turn that member must send an email out to a different member of the Tribe. The goal is to get all members of the Tribe to respond in the fastest timely manner. Once you have collected as many members of the Tribe as possible, it will be the responsibility of the last member to send an email off (sic) the Tribe Leader. The Tribe Leader than will email Dan M This will indicate your Tribe has completed the challenge. BONUS- When distributing  your emails amongst your Tribe, if you include a sentence that indicates a fact about your Product/Service, your Tribe will receive an additional 3 bonus Pts.  My second email to the Tribe:   Good Afternoon All,  Amy C has suggested a good strategy to plan ahead of time.  When it comes time for E-mail tag, lets create a list of in which order each of us should forward the email!  So it'll start with me When I get it, I'll send it to Tawny A Tawny sends it to Chris B Chris sends it to Amy C Amy sends it to Michelle D Michelle sends it to Sharon G Sharon sends it to Jean H Jean sends it to Sharon J Sharon sends it to Paul K Paul sends it to Pat S Pat sends it to Vonda D Vonda sends it to Kevin G Kevin sends it to Doris H Doris you send it to Kathy W (me) and I'll send it to Dan M  Here are some things to keep in mind, check the settings on your email to see how often your mail "receives" and displays new messages, because traditionally mine is set = 10 minutes. I'll alter it to 1 minute for the duration of the week and you should all do the same.  We should phone-call or instant message the next person before you send them your email to verify they're even at their desk. If not, then send it to the next person on the list instead because the rules state the winning tribe will be the one with "as many  members of the tribe as possible" so it's still possible to win without all of us.  Also I just read that we get 3 bonus points when including a fact about the Advantage product in our email. So far here is the only fact I know about Advantage: ADVANAGE IS A VERY POORLY DOCUMENTED PRODUCT! I may very well put that..but if I come up with any other actual facts I'll include them. Does any one else have any information about Advantage that would be helpful? Does it run on AS400 or unix  ? Is it written in cobol? Is there anything unique or interesting about it?  Kathy W   I spent most of Monday afternoon, after our 30 minute meeting, doing the below, instead of taking calls from customers and answering their questions, thus providing actual customer service:   Sending and receiving emails from my Tribe memebers.  Passing out beads, string, and macaroni noodles to those who were not able to make it to the meeting.  Passing out blue file-folder-labels and paper clips. Explaining how to set ones email settings to send-and-receive every 1 minute.  Email from  Day 2   I receive this email from our HR director, who is in my Tribe:  Good Plan, Amy.  There is one team with 60 points- and four of us tied for second place with 55 points. Go Team Go!  Advantage Product: Company purchased was named POLCI. Advantage product runson AS400. They used to be an ASP model like BOS where customers could call in and use software that was stored on-site in Saginaw. Programming language is Synon.  Another worthless trivia tidbit: the furniture in Executive Director Tom H office came from the POLCI office. jh  Jean H   That email reminded me that the product our team was named after  is no longer being sold, and there is only one person in the whole company that still knows enough about it to take phone calls from users, and she does not work in our office. The reason their old furniture is now in our executive directors office is because our larger corporation bought them, laid off their staff, and is now retiring their product.    At 8:15 am I received this email  Dear Tribal Leaders    Please bring your Tribal Necklace to Dan M before 9:00 a.m. this morning.   Dan will return your necklace after the Tribal Council voting has been completed.   During the time from 8:30  10:00; Tribal Leaders will have immunity and cannot lose points for not wearing their necklace.   Thank you,   Jen B   No one has told me about any kind of judging, but I just had to ask my own manager who is Dan M and where does he sit (Ive never met him) and handed him my plastic bead and macaroni necklace.  Im hearing a lot of complaining, as I walk around, that the coarse necklace strings are scratching up the backs of peoples necks. One of my closest co-workers has put tape along the back of his to protect his neck from the twine. I just heard some other appointed Tribe  leader ask my manager, who is Dan M and where does he sit?  Sandy C just returned all our Tribe Leader necklaces. My 2 closest co workers are also the leaders of their respective tribes. When Sandy returned out necklaces I asked her what they were collected for in the first place. She said they were judged for creativity. I told her no one told us our plastic-bead-and-macaroni-shell necklaces were going to be judged for points. She didnt care.    Email at noon:  Todays Activities:    1:00  Popcorn and Cider will be available in the Breakroom  1:00  2:00 Bean Bag Throwing Contest  2:30  Whip Cream Pie Throwing Contest

      I can't keep up with the volume of calls, here at work, half the dept has been called out to be temporary members of some other emergency team, and our call volume seems to have nearly doubled as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountablity Act October 16, 2003 deadline approaches. So I've come in to work on a Sunday to go through some of my backlog of questions called in to me by clients, that I have not yet researched or resolved. Been here for a few hours and now taking a break, away from my call volume, away from my family & kids for a few minutes. Going back and forth on my radio dial between Top-40, Hard-Rock & Metal, and National Public Radio. Checked in on my Neopet Marco55112 and found its status was "dying" because I hadn't maintained it at all since I applied for the account a long time ago, so I figured out how to "feed" it until its staus was "not hungry". My 4 year old son was invited to a birthday party for the first time, and I drove him to it yesterday. I got lost while driving and had to call them for further directions in a restaurant I pulled in to. Last night I dreamed about driving and driving and driving, and woke up very worried. That's so weird about "Roy" of "Sigfried and Roy" getting mauled by one of his own tigers! Adds to the freak-show appeal they already had. Found the email address of ex-Soul Coughing bassist Sebastian Stienberg this week! Still too chicken to email him! My new favorite video is OutKast's "Oh Yeah" video, in which the same guy plays the part of all the musicians in the band. It looked ridiculous back in the early 80's when Paul and Linda McCartney tried the same thing in a video for "Coming Up," but the technology has improved and OutKast looked great!! I love the video and the song, its very pop-y and catchy! Still receiving too many penis-enlargement, weight-loss, debt-relief and singles ads in my email. Trillian instant messenger still hasn't resolved its Yahoo Instant Messenger connectivity problem for those of us with the free version, so I haven't had yahoo IM for about a week now. I keep triallian on at my desk all the time, and put it on on those occasional evenings I can get on the internet at night. My husband scheduled a church class for himself on Tuesday nights, so I had to move my volunteer job tutoring English as a Second Language at a drop-in center in our neighborhood, from my usual Tuesday night, to Thursday nights, so I can watch the kids while he's at church. Thursday is more inconvenient for me, because I enjoyed being the one to take our daughter to Girl Scouts every other Thursday, now he has to do it without me. I've been enjoying emailing and Instant messaging a few old high school classmates since the reunion, and we have a 'myfamily.com' page for photos I've been enjoying. The big news here in Minneapolis to me, is that the First Avenue Club, where the best non-arena touring bands play, is very nearly bankrupt and may close soon. I will be officially old, if that happens. Its where I used to spend Saturday nights so often, in collge. Its where I saw Soul Coughing and Rollins band so many times. It's a local fixture of freak-dom and we'll be deminished without it! I might have to sneak a camera in with me if I go see any bands any time soon, as my friend Debi wants, to get a picture of me in there, before it's gone!! Song on the radio at the moment: Lil Jon and the East Side Boys: Get Low. I'm liking it!! I have so many passwords to so many different web sites and softwares we use here at work, I need to keep a written list of them somewhere, I'd use the same one everywhere, but its getting more commeon for each site or software to insist on a specific format. I just pulled out my well-worn copy of Alvin Toffler's "Future Shock" looking for my favorite passage about how the children of "today" (written in 1970) are at risk of growing up to be short-attention-span novelty-junkies, because the very same brain functions that have to take place in order to learn something new, which it is dangerous to have to over-use due to the neurochemical process it goes though, maintains an expected usage-level of some kind. Will quote it if I find it.

      I just cut and pasted this out of some kid's web log. It made my day: Friday, November 21, 2003 WWJD?  So I was in the movie theater and this guy's cell phone rings. I am pissed but then even more pissed that he picks up the phone and strarts talking. I was ready to get enraged and start yelling but then I looked at my wrist and saw the bracelet that says "WWJD" or what would Jesus do. So I calmed down and did what He would do. I set the guy on fire and sent him to hell.  // posted by Scott @ 11/21/2003 09:29:20 PM

      Mass layoff at work. 10% laid off. Including two close coworkers of mine, and one of our programmers who is practically one of the founders of the company, who has been a loyal employee for 30 years, and was very close to retirement! I'm starting to want out now. I should start looking.  We got a Game Cube and the game Animal Crossing for ourselves as a family Christmas present. I just love watching my kids play it. Its such cute little virtual reality neighborhood, and I love watching my 2 kids each manouver their little characters around in it, and think of funny creative things to do.  My husband and both kids just got over strep throat! I'm lucky I didn't get it.

      I found this on federalreview.com today. Too funny...  A Brooklyn state assemblyman wants a special hotline to report drivers who are talking on hand-held cell phones. Assemblyman Feliz Ortiz says the hotline would connect to the State Department of Motor Vehicles. The caller would report the time, date, location and license plate number of the car being driven by the talker. Think about this for more than two seconds and it becomes obvious that this plan is flawed. The only people who are going see a person using a cell phone while driving would be other drivers. And how are those other drivers going to call the hotline unless they use their own cell phones while driving?

      I just dound this on somone elses web log, it made my day...  For those of you who watch what you eat...Here's the final word on nutrition and health. It's a relief to know the truth after all those conflicting medical studies.  1. The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  2. The Mexicans eat a lot of fat and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  3. The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  4. The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  5. The Germans drink a lot of beer and eat lots of sausages and fats and suffer fewer heart attacks than the British or Americans.  CONCLUSION: Eat and drink what you like. Speaking English is apparently what kills you.

      Discouraged today.  Stock price plummited.  We can't hire back those we laid off now that we're hiring again 1 month later, as officially in their employee records we documented each of them was let go for performance issues (but didn't tell them).  Bulk email from various executives tell us what spin we should put on all our bad news if anyone asks.  Husband hates his new job even though it pays more, might quit & try to go back where he came from.  Beautiful 10 year old daughter slipped in the bathtub this week end and chipped a small part of a front tooth off. Dentist smoothed it, but says you can't restore that part of a front tooth because it's too "high stress."  4 year old son will be 5 in 2 weeks, but is such an angry, destructive boy. Last night husband was out, son just hit us (me and his sister) over and over and kept throwing shoes and toys.  What I have going for me: I make a full time pay check (such as it is) and still get off at 3:00 and can pick my daughter up as she gets off from school and take her straight home like an at-home mom. I work so close to home and so close to my kids' school and day care it is not even funny. My new desk is right under the heating vent! Its so tropical at my new desk! I have 30 days off to take by December 31, 20 vacation days, 8 sick days, and 2 personal floating holidays; and every few weeks I work on a Saturday and get a week-day off in return! I surf the internet at my desk all the time, so far no one's complained, although it could happen  at any time. Any networking guy could figure it out, but I don't think anyone really checks. But like I said, they could. The Adam and the Ants bullitin boards I check frequently really cheer me up!   Sorry I'm such an incredible downer today.

      I spent a great week off with my kids while my daughter's school was on spring vacation. We didn't have money to do much, but we hit a lot of libraries and the park when it was nice out, and one night we all went swimming at the Shorview Tropics Water park! One day we packed bag lunches and brought my husband lunch at work & ate in his cafeteria with him. Friday night husband and kids and I met at H&R block to get our taxes done (we're getting a refund!), then my car died on the way home! Second time in less than two weeks! I put last week's repair, I can't even rememer what it was, and this weeks new alternator on a credit card. I am so ashamed. I want to bury myself. I found a copy of a book of "16-Magazine" history at one of the libraries, I love reading it so much, it is so funny to read old 16-Magazine articles, and read memories of former pop stars like Donny Osmond and the Bay City Rollers have to say about what it was like to be interviewed and featured in 16. I used to read 16, and their competitor, Tiger Beat, all the time!

      Car died in the parking lot yesterday, when I was trying to leave. Had to go back in my office to use the phone to:  Call my daughter's school's in-house day care & arrange for her after-school care. Call my daughter's school's front office & ask them to direct her to the day care, rather than wait outside for me as usual. Call Saturn to arrange to have my car brought in. Call Saturn's desginated tow truck company to have them tow my car to Saturn. Call my husband to arrange for him to leave work early & pick up both kids before 6 pm and bring them home Ask a co worker for a ride home, myself. Call my daughter at the after school day care just to make sure she made it. She was sobbing.  Last night, using my husband's car: After dinner we all got in the car to drive husband to church class at 7:00. Drive the kids and me to daughter's school for parent teacher conference. Drive home for an hour. Drive to church to pick up  husband, got home around 10 pm.  This would all happen to me during a bus strike :(  Not to mention, this is going to cost me a fortune, just when I thought I was catching up!

      On Ant Rap, we started a thread called Happiness Around the World, to balance out the other thread we have going called Depression Around the World. We had to put what makes us happy, I've posted to it twice, and here is what I put:  Post 1:  OK  I work 6 am - 3 pm which allows me to get a full time paycheck (such as it is) and still pick up my daughter as her school is getting out and take her home like an at-home parent (my husband takes her to school on his way to work)!  We drive separate cars, we used to not even have 1!  I get rave reviews at work, I must say so myself. And the call center I work for hasn't been outsourced to India...yet!  I can listen to what ever music I want on my radio/cd player at my desk, and have yet to get caught playing on the internet during the day as much as I do!  My 10 year old daughter does an exact perfect impersonation of Patrick the Starfish from Sponge Bob Square Pants, saying "May I take your hat sir?" like an idiot! It makes me laugh to hard I'm still laughing!  14,000 Hmong refugees in Thai camps are going to be elligible to immigrate to the US this summer, and most will probably come here to Minnesota, which make MN great, and on a purely selfish level, allows me to eat more Hmong food and hear more keej music!  It is almost spring and I won't have to wear a coat and boots out.  My daughters math-tutoring at Sylvan learning center is working! Her math skills are improving after 2 years of watching her suffer!  I get to chat to Ant fans all over the world, here and at only-lovers every day!  I still can't believe I got to see the year 2000!  I love tea, I'm going to make another cup right now!   Post 2: In 1983 when I was 18 years old I got an amazing scholarship to attend a 4-year college, my dream come true. Strangely, it was in St. Paul Minnesota, a location I knew absolutely nothing about. I even had to pull out an atlas to figure out where it was. The college experience itself was amazing, very extreme, both good and bad, but I really was lucky to get it, especially because of its location.  As soon as I arrived, and the taxi was taking me from the airport to the school I looked out the window and thought My God, I've seen this place in my dreams! All those times growing up and feeling like I was in the wrong place...this looks exactly like what I was thinking of!  Its been 21 years now and I still haven't lost that feeling! The extreme sub zero cold and the 12+ inches of snow don't really happen enough days per year to be significant to me. Its a great place both to spend your money, restaurants, concerts etc...and a great place to be broke because there are so many parks and museums and recreational centers and libraries and other events for free. There are enough freaks here to keep me in company..athough I do find that they're harder to find as I get older. I can't bear to be away from Minneapolis and St. Paul for more than about 2 weeks at a time!  I am deeply proud to be able to claim past senators Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy and Paul Wellstone as my political forbears in the Minnesota Democrats Farmers and Labor Party. Not to disagree with or offend anyone else's politics here, but that's just something that suits who I am so well, its really amazing to me.  Did I mention that I just really really like it here? And that my 'new' (5+ years now) house is walking distance from two lakes with public beaches (free!) , open all summer?  And every time I double-check with my 10 year old daughter to verify that she still likes her school, she insists that she wouldn't want to go anywhere else! I just NEED her to know that if she were ever unhappy in her school I would immediately find her a new one and transfer her, but she insists she loves her school, and she should know because she's been there for 5 years!

      Sat here at my desk at work for 5 hours today. Got 2 phone calls from customers, both of which were systems-engineer related so they'll have to wait until Monday to get answers. Updated my on-going list of clients, for the depatment, to add some new clients, and upate the sales represetntative for all of them, as one sales rep has quit, and the clients were re-assigned to two new ones. I changed about 10 back up tapes and typed in about 10 end of day functions for about 10 databases, in preparation for this week end. Also searched for Chip Skylark jpegs so I could use one for my avatar on OnlyLoversLeft Alive. Chip Skylark is the dreamy cartoon pop star who appears on the cartoon The Fairly Odd Parents, and I've decided to devote my life to him.      Listened to Rollins Band's Get Some GO again 3 times, then top 40 radio for about the last 2 hours. All Evervesense all the time. Luckly I live Evervesence. And Brittany Spears'  "Toxic", who ever mixed that was a genius! It would be better withoug her vocal.

      Hey, I wore an actual dress to work today, pumps tights everything. I look like a total girl, for a change! Our "lent" challange at home is "no eating out." It might sound shallow, but as much as we rely on fast food like a crutch, every time we're too lazy to clean the kitchen, and/or cook oursleves, we take our kids out somewhere. And husband 'forgets' his lunch and eats out at work quite a lot. And we stop at them as an impulse when we're driving around on week ends, running errands, with our kids. It might be why we all get so crabby. Fast food is not healthy. And we know it adds up financially, monthly. So far its been a great idea. And I'm reading Fast Food Nation. It started out just being about the history of various early leaders in the fast food industry. Then it went on to include how fast food companies recruit new business owners, then manipulte them out of all their money, including charging big rent for the property the stores sit on. Now I'm at the part where it explains how the cheeply-created food contains edible perfumes developed in a lab. I'm a former Burger King employee myself, from when I was 19.  Sunday I went back to Sam's Club and re-applied to work week-ends there, in preparation for this summer, when we'll be paying for both our kids to attend day care full time.  Last week I called my boss, my boss's boss, and my boss's boss's boss in to a meeting with me to ask them to appeal the decision to hire strangers off the street, instead of restoring the two specific people we lost in the lay off. But I lost that one. The dilberts-speak they used to justify it was truely amazing though. I wish I'd had a tape recorder on! At least I know I tried though.  Yesterday afternoon I called a few companies I like, to ask them if they grant informational interviews, so I can look elsewhere. I'd just like to know more about them. Guidant said they don't grant informational interviews. Medtronic , I had to leave a voice mail and they never called me back. I might call Veritas this afternoon. I know I'm lucky to have a job at all in this economy, especially a technology job, the exact kind being exported overseas by so many other companies.   I put my yahoo IM on this morning. I've been leaving it off lately, because I got sick of being propositioned sexually, and getting all those messages from men in India and various places all over the Middle East, who beg me to arrange their immigration and/or get them a job in the US. I even put in my profile 'don't flirt with me, don't tell me to do your  job search'. Well today I put it on and almost immediately got a message from a guy in Marocco, who very kindly allows me to chat in French with him, but he's very persistant that I should find him an American girlfriend to marry. Ho hum. More of the same.  Marco's message board at onlyloversleftalive.com keeps me sane.

      I am listening to JackieOnAssid's CD "Zip Me Up" at my desk today, and all week this week! I watched us bomb and shoot the hell out of the Iraqi city of Falluja (sp?) last night, and I just kept thinking, "Damn, we suck!" I joined Curves for Women gym, but I only joined on a basis of one month at a time. Per month, it costs a little more that way, but I don't want a one-year contract, what if it turns out to be lame, or I change my hours and can't go? I really do work out there for 1/2 hour almost every afternoon now.  My husband kept his job at the St Paul Companies after a mass-layoff that they had, and even got a small raise. Men from India keep sending me yahoo instant messages asking me to do their USA job-search for them. They just don't get it.

      Still no computer at home, I use this one here at work on lunch and breaks, week ends I hit one at a local library for 30 - 60 min. Check all my emails, check Adam Ant's site and Marco's site. It's totally stupid we're still paying for AOL when we don't even have a computer at home, but we are, so we can keep the same AOL email account names when we get a new one. Both my kids got glassses last week. My son keeps looking over the top of his or taking them off. He's only 5, he doesn't know what things are supposed to look like. At a department meeting today our big bosses sat in and described some new products our company has developed and will start marketing, and will arrange demos for us. I was thrilled and decided I like us again (for now). I need a new hair cut. Maybe I should get my ears pierced.

      I"m both enjoying and despairing at watching so many people around me in my real life, have a gold-fish-like collective memory that only goes back as far as the last frequently-shown news image. Today everyone remembers this graphic footage, complete with disturbing audio, of an American get decapitated by an Iraqi. Days before that, the could only remember the pile of naked Iraqi civilian prisoners withe female guard giving the thumbs-up sign Before that they could only remember the American building contractors being hung from a bridge , Ect.  Today I had a person who sits ONE DESK away from me use company email to forward one of those multi-forwarded emails with all the >>> 'greater than' signs at the beginning of each line.  She sent it to me and about 10 other people in our office. It was about people in line at an American grocery store proudly harassing a Burqua-wearing Iraqi woman about how she wouldn't have the privilege of being there among them if our soldiers hadn't liberated her. In spite of the fact she knows I teach English to refugees and am active in immigrant rights, and in spite of the fact that one of the other people on the list is from Nigeria. Oh well here it is...  Subject: FW: (no subject)      >  As some of you may know, one of my sons serves in the military. He is still stateside, here in California. He called me yesterday to let me know how warm and welcoming people were to him, and his troops, everywhere he goes, telling me how people shake their hands, and thank them for being willing to serve, and fight, for not only our own freedoms but so that others may have them also. But he also told me about an incident in the grocery store he stopped at yesterday, on his way home from the base.   >   >He said that ahead of several people in front of him stood a woman dressed in a burkha. He said when she got to the cashier she loudly remarked about the US flag lapel pin the cashier wore on her smock.   >The cashier reached up and touched the pin, and said proudly, "yes, I always wear it and I probably always will."   >   >The woman in the burkha then asked the cashier when she was going to stop bombing her countrymen, explaining that she was Iraqi.   >   >A gentleman standing behind my son stepped forward, putting his arm around my son's shoulders, and nodding towards my son, said in a calm and gentle voice to the Iraqi woman: "Lady, hundreds of thousands of men and women like this young man have fought and died so that YOU could stand here, in MY country and accuse a check-out cashier of bombing YOUR countrymen. It is   >my belief that had you been this outspoken in YOUR own country, we wouldn't need to be there today. But, hey, if you have now learned how to speak out so loudly and clearly, I'll gladly buy you a ticket and pay your way back to Iraq so you can straighten out the mess in YOUR country that you are obviously here in MY country to avoid." Everyone within hearing distance cheered.   >   >Pass it on....    I FUCKING NEED A NEW JOB!

      It is Saturday May 8, 2004 at about 1:00 pm. It was my turn to work the Saturday 8:00 - 1:00 shift in my office, we take turns doing it alone. And wouldn't you know it my husband had a church class scheduled at that same time, so I brought both my kids to work with me.  When I was a kid, for a few months, my mom had to clean the neighborhood LDS church and scrub its floors so we could receive "Church Welfare" while my dad was out of town. And apparently it wasn't tragic enough to me and my little sister that my way-pregnant no-car mom had to walk there, then get down on her hands and knees and scrub scuff-marks off the floor in order to receive aid from a church to which we had always given 10% of our gross-income in the past. We insisted we wanted to watch saturday morning cartoons while we were there, so we wouldnt have to miss those few hours per week that tv acually used to show cartoons back then. So our mom put our portable tv in our red wagon and lugged it all the way there, on our walk.  So I brought our portable tv, with Nintendo Game Cube and the game Animal Crossing attached, in the trunk of my car, and brought it up the elevator with us, in our red wagon, partly in honor of that memory. And partly to keep them busy for 5 hours. Also crackers, juice boxes , and microwave popcorn. My son found a can of coke on this up-for-grabs snack table my department keeps and has already spilled it right under my chair at my desk, I have soaked up most of it that I can, out of the carpet, with paper towels, but its always going to look like I peed or barfed or something on this carpet, I'm afraid.  So few phone calls this morning, why was this even necessary?  Last week end I bought a $23 box of American Sign Language Magnetic Poetry magnets, brought them to work, and was horrified to find out that of the 340 "sign language tiles" advertized on the box, the great majority are letters of the alphabet over and over again, and about 30 or 40 actual word signs. Plus I had already lost the receipt. So I sent out an email to about 30 or 40 people in my department to say "free American Sign Language alpahbet magnets at my desk, come get them, have fun, spell your name." A lot of people visited me to say they know some sign language, or want to learn it, and a deaf lady said she'd teach me anything I want to know...so maybe they weren't such a waste of money!  Like so many others, I'm horrified by the pictures of the abuse by American soldiers against Iraqi prisoners of war. If this is how we treat people who ARE covered by the Geniva Convention, how are we treating those held at Guantanimo Bay, who are not. Never mind, we already know. I appreciated what a comentator on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart had to say, President Bush's non-appology statements on Iraqi TV just seem to be saying, "Don't judge us by the actions of a...um... well, don't judge us by our actions. " And, "Just because it's something we DID, doesn't mean it's something we WOULD DO!"  Good lord my kids are running around on my office's 4th floor balcony outside. I have to go rescue them. It is time to go.

      I'm at work alone on a Saturday. The phone ain't ringing.  I've been working out 30-45 minutes a day, 3-4 times a week at Curves for Women. I don't think I look any different, but I do feel better! I've been attending American Sign Language club at a local Barnes and Nobel on Friday nights. I figure if I learn and retain 3 new signs each time, then it is definately worth the 60-90 minutes I spend there.  We took our kids and a neighbor girl to see Harry Potter on opening night a few weeks ago. In spite of the fact that the place was packed with families with kids, we got stuck sitting behind this angry, childless, 20-something year old girl who kept turning around and complaining only to ME that she just couldn't enjoy this (children's!) movie because my 5 year old son was figiting in his seat and asking us pretty much the same questions about the movie I could hear coming from all the other children the whole time. My husband laughed all the way home about her, but I fumed for 2 says straight!  I've also tried to go back to working at Sams Club on week ends, and I've tried to apply to other stores such as Target and Barnes and Nobel, trying to pay off the huge dental bill our family has run up over the last year, but no one is hiring at the moment.   Both kids are in a local YMCA day care at a local middle-school for the summer. For once they're both in the same place, and my 5-year-old son's behavior has matured so much in the last few days, now that he's surrounded all day by older kids and not by toddlers and other pre-schoolers!   Last week end we drove to Green Bay for my husband's 42-year-old female cousin's wedding. We drove 7 hours in a total thunderstorm with monsoon-like rain, thunder, lighting and sometimes even fog. That drive normally takes 5 hours or less. The best part of the wedding was the scandalously dressed under-age teen age cousins, looking like the Hilton sisters! I'm so old, I can litterally remember them when my husband and I were first dating, and they were babies.   It's mid June! We should go to the beach! I live near 2!

      Friday, July 23, The Saint Paul Travelers Company announced it will lay off 10% of its staff. The company did not make that announcement to its own employees. My husband got no email or memo, and there was no meeting to announce it. My husband learned this because his window from his cube at the Saint Paul Travelers overlooks the news ticker dat-board at the Minnesota Public Radio building nearby in downtown Saint Paul!  Saturday July 24, we took our kids to the Minnesota Zoo. The St Paul Travelers Company had an employee discount day, and we purchased tickets for it several weeks ago. We watched an IMAX film about coral reefs, went through an exibit about animals from Madigascar, including Lemurs, We rode on a hay-truck being pulled by a John Deere tractor to a farm yard and the kids enjoyed the petting zoo. I couldn't drag my 5 year old son out of the petting zoo pen! He was petting a goat, and protesting, "But he likes me! He likes me!" We had lunch under a canopy, part of the company plan, but the Saint Paul Travelers is such a big company, my husband didn't recognize anyone there! We came back exhausted and dehydrated, just in time for my daughter to go to her friend's slumber party.  Sunday, yesterday, we drove off at about 9 am to join our friends at their camp-ground. Many of them were old college class-mates of ours, but really were my husband's friends more than they were mine. He's currently in a stock-investment club with most of them, but their whole purpose for this camp-out was to play role-playing games. Not Dungeons and Dragons specifically, but other games like it. One of them had made super-hero capes for all the children, and when my daughter asked if she had any purple ones...yes she did! We were all so impressed, as my daughter has been looking for a purple cape for weeks, to complete her costume of her hero Raven , the Teen Titan! The adults played volley ball. The children played with squirt guns, and I took numerous trips with them to to the nearby old-fashioned water pump from the ground, pumping the lever so they could fill all their squirt guns some more. I've secretly banished all toy guns from our house. I don't buy them and luckily no one has ever given them to my kids as a gift. So this was a total novelty to both my kids and they loved it! Again, that afternoon we returned home more dehydrated than before, I fell asleep on the couch that afternoon. Made hot dogs for dinner, fell asleep on the couch after both my kids' baths, and still slept through the night, and didn't want to get up this morning!

      I just found out my friend Jeff who applied for a job here, didn't get it. So I'm not taking it too well right now.  The big news here in our office today is that the 'activities committee' set up two large book shelves in our break room, to serve as the company lending-library. Today both shelves are STOCKED FULL...of paperback crime novels! Every last one of them is a crime novel. Well apparently at 2:00 we're having an ice-cream social for it anyway, so I'm going.  My boss forwarded my friend's resume to another manager in the company who is also looking for someone, so I still have some hope for that, but he'll have to interview again, and even if he gets it he won't be in my department. Grrrr.

      Two week-ends ago, we took our kids to ride the first day of the Minneapolis light-rail. We were in line for about an hour, but it was still worth it , we rode from the Veterans' Administration Hospital at Fort Snelling to the Metrodome in downtown Minnapolis. Then we rode the city bus back to the VA to get our car, and go home. Somewhat hypocritical of us, since we never ride the bus any more.  Last week end we took our kids to downtown St Paul to watch the "Grand Excursion" paddle boats come in from Davenport (LA? IA?) but as soon as the first one appeared, it started pouring rain and we had to take our kids home!  The next day was Sunday, the Fourth of July, and it didn't rain that day, for a change, and we took our kids swimming at Long Lake, a city beach near our house and we had a blast and got sunburned in a relatively short amount of time!  Two days ago, Saturday, we took our kids to downtown Minneapolis, to see They Might Be Giants play a free children's show in front of Orchestra Hall. The whole big plaza was full of alt-rock parents dragging their very confused children behind them becuase it was the parents who wanted to see TMBG, not the kids! My 10 year old daughter whined the whole time, and my 5 year old son spent all his time playing with my hair.  Saturday night my friend Debi had her cook-out in her back yard. It was so great. 3 people there now work in an office I USED to work in, and it was fun to hear the gossip and grill hamburgers and roast marshmellows for s'mores on the embers! She filled a little rubber wading pool with water and we called it a pool party.  Yesterday, Sunday, I took my son to a sign-language Catholic church in North Minneapolis. It was odd for me to take my son to Church, when it's my husband who is the Catholic, and I'm the athiest. But I'm trying to take advanage of every free opportunity to improve my sign language and that's one thing I can say for visiting churches, its free. My son spent the whole time alternately climbing on me, going limp, and humming his own little repetitive tunes to himself. I'm sure everyone there thought he was retarded. I'll take pity over hostility any day!  The free sign language group I've been meeting with for an hour or two on Friday nights at a local Barnes and Nobels book store have been really helpful, as well as the Friday sign-language lunches I've been having with co workers, 2 of whom are deaf.  Back at my desk at work right now. Chatting to strangers over my IM, at my desk. Taking phone calls from users. Today I might find out if my old friend gets the job here, that he interviewed for, over a week ago. That would be so great!  I submitted my application for part time work at Barnes and Nobels this week-end. So that makes Sam's Club, Target, and BN that I have applied to for a 2nd job. Each place says that they probably won't be looking for more part timers until their summer students go back to school in the fall. My husband and I are in a contest to see who can get a part-time job first. Who ever loses has to stay home with the kids while the other person works.
