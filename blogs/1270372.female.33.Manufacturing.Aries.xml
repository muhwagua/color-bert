      Driving my mother's car is an experience of delight, joy, exhilaration and a tiny wee bit of frustration. This car has no funny tinkling noises that make you think the engine blots are coming undone. No burps and giggles. No, this car doesn't play jokes on me like my old slanted Rose. This baby corners like its on rails. The steering is effortless, not made by Mr. Armstrong. Its sooooooo smooth. Like cornstarch on a baby's bottom.  But, like my baby Rose, my mother's car sounds like it's in the 50's. My mother likes to listen to old rock and roll. There's an Elvis Cd in. And I blare it. So, there I am driving my mother's 89 Honda Civic, blasting Elvis like I'm on my way to a sock hop, reeling around the corners and I just want to hit the gas.  But for some reason the speed limits in Edmonton are the same they were in the 50's as well.  Drat.

      I've left the farm. My last day there was spent alone. All alone. Naturally I had to do the things I don't normally get to do. So what kind of hijinx did I get up to? Photographic hijinx that's what. I'm shooting black and white film right now and the idea of arty and personal photographs came to mind.   My camera can be set up to act on a timer and with a bench and a blanket in the pine trees, I created my first black and white nudes. Me as the subject of course since I was alone after all. I hope they turn out because I managed to get alot of sap on my feet and a few pine needles in places and crevices that shouldn't be accessed by pointy prickly things like pine needles. I also ended up with a considerable amount of mosquito bites.  Not an entirely pleasant experience.   The question I have now is how and where do I get them developed. Do I do the one hour experience. Make it quick, get out of there fast kind of thing or the can I have those in a week, I'll give you lots of time to make extra prints.  Mmmnnn?

      This one just fell out and its worth posting here.  Could you send me  a bunch of words?  A bouquet of letters  that will attract certain birds.  Arranged all nice,  with a ribbon or two.   A bundle of b's c's and a's,  all letters will do.  Don't worry, don't fret,  all will be fine. Any words smell pretty in my little mind.

      I found this quote today while I was looking at photographers on the net.  ‚ÄúWe're born naked. We actually should live naked--not literally, but in terms of honesty and openness.‚Äù  I agree. I always want to be stark.  I have an deep desire to reveal myself so completely and starkly. To let people see me. Really see me. To not hold anything back, to let my emotions out. I want to strip away my skin and bones, lay myself bare. If only my emotions had a physical form that people could look at slowly bit by bit as to not scare them. Scan me slowly. But its not like that. Me, I come rushing out like a bull penned up. Startling and unexpected, the spectator unprepared, not knowing that the box in front of them holds a Jack. Turn the little wind up key, listen to the sweet song, and then ca-pow! The lids off and all of me pops out. Stuff my springs back down and close the door.  I feel the anticipation, the tinkely tinkely dee, tinkely tinkely dee, winding up, winding up, waiting for the hinge to spring.  I don‚Äôt think people really want to know what‚Äôs in the little box. They say they do. Let me in, let me know you, let me see you. But its really the anticipation, the wind up, that they like. Ooohh its mysterious, ooh what could it be, what does it look like‚Ä¶  tinkely tinkely dee, tinkely tinkely dee‚Ä¶..  Just stop winding the key. Don‚Äôt let the door pop open. But, boy do I think I will burst. I need to stretch my springs. Just be careful you don‚Äôt stretch them so far that they loose their essence.

      My sister, my only sister left today. Grandma and I drove Catherine to Calgary. Despite our differences and how badly we annoy one another, I think as the years go on we get closer and the differences slip away and we see more of each other in one another. She‚Äôs quite spectacular in her ability to be patient, and kind. Always looking to keep things smooth where I was always looking to ruffle things up. Both of these are valuable and need one another. How can you ruffle if it isn‚Äôt smooth and what to smooth out if it hasn‚Äôt been ruffled.  On the way home, we picked up my uncle Gary. I asked him what he thought my mother‚Äôs best quality was and then I asked him what he thought the worst was. We went through this for him and my Grandmother and then for me. What we discovered was one was often necessary for the other. A person‚Äôs undesirable quality feeds their best and vice versa.   I suppose it all balances out like sunshine and darkness.

      Tonight Catherine, Grandma and I went for a drive in the country. We saw a whole variety of animals. First, we saw some cattle near the road. One was down on his front knees (do cows have knees?) and had stuck his head through the fence trying to get to the sweet clover nearby. I got out of the car, grabbed some clover and walked over. They ate it right out of my hand. I got them to raise their heads high and all I could think about was the time I saw cow's eyes in little dishes in Biology class and the times I have seen cow tongue saran wrapped to a styrofoam plate in a butcher aisle. I swear I'll never eat beef again.   Next we saw 2 female deer standing in the tall hay grass. Did you know that when you see deer standing out in the fields and you scare tham into running, they actually go boing boing boing. They don't really run. They jump like kangaroos.  Finally and the weirdest of all..  We're driving along, singin a song when all of a sudden, perched there like a hawk surveying the horizon was a small orange fluffy CAT. Like a regular house cat, just sitting there in the middle of nowhere. I went closer and purred hey kitty kitty and sure enough it jumped off the fence post and strolled through the ditch and came up and rubbed itself against my leg. Mangey little thing all scratched up with half an ear missing. Tough little kitty. You could tell it had tangled with something and didn't get fed Tender Vittles for dinner. I thought about the city cats I have had over the years and how they wouldn't last 2 minutes out here in the wild wild wilderness of rural Alberta.

      The reunion is over, but I'll stay on the farm for another week. Catherine is here until Tuesday and I'll drive back up to Edmonton on Saturday with my mother. Tommorrow, Catherine and I are going yarn shopping in Olds and you know what.. I don't think it gets much better than that. Shopping for yarn in Olds with your older sister. If I could only knit her some common sense.   Today, she came into the bedroom. I was reading and resting. She asked me how I felt.  Jill? Yes?  Can I ask you something? What? How do you feel right now? Fine. Why? You don't feel funny? (She's holding her tummy and I start thinking about those pork sausages I saw her scarfing down) No. What's the matter? (She lies down on the bed opposite me, pushing all my clothes out of the way. She looks worried and sickly.) I feel all funny. My tummy hurts and I have ringing in my ears and I feel all dizzy. What do you think is the matter? (As though I would know) I don't know..maybe it was something you ate. (Hullo. Pork Sausages.)  A moment later she says Frig.   Catherine can't swear ever for some reason. I sometimes imagine her getting really mad.. Frig you! Frig off! Jesus Frigging Christ! For Frig's sake!  Its dawned on her all of a sudden she hasn't taken the anti-depressant medication she takes to stop chewing her fingernails for 3 days. I assure her that's probably the culprit to her aches and pains. She gets up and leaves the room. I follow a moment later and find her in the next room on the phone with our mother long distance confirming her suspicions. My confirmation obviously wasn't good enough.  See what I mean?  Then I get on the phone with Mom and ask her if she's ever wondered what is wrong with her children. I mean we're both on anti-depressants. Catherine is overly concerned with her physical state to the point of neurosis and I am overly concerned with my emotional state to the point of mania and did Mom have any thoughts on this.  Well, the day after our blessed family reunion, my mother admits she has felt all along that a terrible mistake happened twice. She was given the wrong babies. Her real children were out there somewhere leading non dramatic lives of a milk toast existence, calmly carrying on. I mean, she says, neither of you look like me.  Isn't that nice? Thanks Mom.

      I don't think I really like that poem very much. It fell out when someone commented that I was an early riser.Reading it again it sounds as though I'm desperatly trying to find peace if mind that is so ellusive. I seem to sound kind of fragile and lost in the poem. It's not an accurate representation, and I'll make note of that right now to avoid any confusion hence-forth.   So there.

      I woke up this morning, slipped on my jeans, still wearing white tshirt. Still sleepy and unfocused, I got as far as the living room where my sister was still sleeping. I crawled into her bed, snarled Move over and then went in for the cuddle. She acted as though I was some kind of alien leper being who had invaded with poisonous gases and no I didn't fart. I got out and woke up from this harsh reality.  Family is flipping flapjacks this morning. I feel like a pioneer.

      Yesterday was the reunion at the old Hainstock school.  The school my mother used to walk to in the bitter prairie blizzard winter. Its seems so small and cavernous now. The old swing set is still in the yard. Partially overgrown with trees and weeds. Very eerie.   The reunion got off to a start with a car rally. We piled into cars with instructions in hand and set off on a virtual treasure hunt of landmarks, signposts and in search of old farmsteads. Funny and interesting for about a half an hour. I just wanted to stop and take pictures of cows.  When we got back, the place was in full swing. Food production was in overdrive and the potluck parade was on. A room full of strangers tied to me through some connection, I flew the freak flag with my cousin Erin, being the only 2 tattooed anything, especially girls. We huddled on the front step and bitched about the respectability and straightness of the stock we had come from. Alternatively, we relished in the fact that there were no raging alcoholics, overt red necks or havoc and dysfunction. Lucky us to come from a nice, normal functioning family who don‚Äôt tattoo themselves, pierce their nipples, noses, belly buttons and other unseen parts, or yell obscenities and drink lasciviously to excess.  We skipped the skits, the presentations, and the PowerPoint demonstration of our family history. At one point I wandered in to find I had won the prize for taking the longest time to get there. I felt like telling the room of nice prairie folk that I had hitch hiked with a bunch of bikers or something. Just to make my mother scoff and my sister scowl. But I came to this with my best behavior packed and left my feather ruffling tools at home for once.

      There‚Äôs nothing like a good ride on a quad. A small death machine, spewing gas fumes between your legs, scaring the shit out your older sister who clings for dear life in white linen as you tear around the grass, baseball cap backwards, old lee jeans, tank top exposing tattoos with tree branches whipping at your gentle girl flesh. Dust flying behind you in big plumes as you tear up the gravel driveway leaving bugs in your teeth and dirt in your bra.  Hey Mom! Wanna go for a ride? Well, Ok, but you be careful Jill Ya, Ya. Hop on.  A few minutes later‚Ä¶  Jill if you don‚Äôt slow down.. I won‚Äôt ‚Ä¶..Jill I mean it! Jill, I‚Äôm going to jump off. JILL!!!  I‚Äôm a small, pretty, terror to my family. I scare them, worry them, and leave them wondering what they‚Äôre going to do with me.  If only I would just slow down.

      There was a ding dong of a door bell I didn‚Äôt know existed. The farm has a doorbell? Well whadda know, I thought. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to get that?" Catherine looked at me with impatience and a face that said can‚Äôt you see I‚Äôm busy.   Hi. (there are 2 strangers at the door) Hi. You must be‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm Anita‚Äôs daughter, Jillian. And you must be‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm Darlene. I‚Äôm a friend of Agnes‚Äô. Is she here? No, I think she‚Äôs gone into town. My sister and I woke up to find no one here. (Thinking since we‚Äôre having a reunion, they must be distant relatives.) Do you want to come in?  They came in and then Darlene sprung it on me, the real reason she was at the door. They were messengers of God, coming to spread the word. No, they weren‚Äôt my ‚Äòfamily‚Äô after all. Not in the sense that I thought. The Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses out here on a farm in the middle of gorgeous nowhere? To my perplexment, I found myself entertaining these 2 nice women. So for the next 20 minutes, I politely listened to the word of God being channeled through them and accepted their offer to read me scriptures proving the world is coming to an end. Then without hesitation I told them that I believed that once there was a God but now he is gone.   Nonetheless, I reluctantly accepted her card and the pamphlet encouraging me to save myself (which happens to be published in 254 languages and tells me what exactly God requires of me. I think the real question that needs to be answered is What is God willing to do that  I require of ‚Äòhim‚Äô). I promised, albeit with my fingers crossed behind my back which everyone from childhood knows protects you from the almighty wrath of God for lying, to call. Which I won‚Äôt.   I‚Äôm a bad girl.

      The day stated at 6:30 am. I awoke suddenly from a strange dream that I no longer remember. The lure of the quiet outdoors was too tempting. I slithered out of bed, still in last night's baggy black pants and black tank top, slipped on my shoes and snuck out the door. The sounds of birdsong and silence surrounded my senses. Intoxicating. The crisp morning air brushing up against my newday flesh. I wandered out back near the barn. Looked at the new growth field and waded out in the waist high grass. I felt if I allowed my knees to buckle, I would disappear forever. Swallowed up by the crop.   I took a photo of the old red barn peeking throught the grasses.  Next, I wandered to the garden and looked at the brand new carrot babies pushing through the soil.. I'm here! I'm here! They screamed without voice. I layed down on the ground following the advice of a new found friend and listened for the wisdom. I heard the chirper of the morning bird conference. What do they want to say to one another? One bird seemed to be preturbed at my presence. Yakking, screaming at my interference in the morning meeting. I listened, listened...  Hawks crying off far away, Bulls yawning, the flat palm like poplar leaves clapping in the wind, everything was talking and no one was saying anything.

      My mind is on the subject of will. Excerting your will. Upon others, upon the earth, upon the future. How do we do this safely? Or even productively? How does one excert their will without negative repercussions? How can I? I often seem to get myself in unwanted situations, be  in situations where I am unwanted, or generally cause havoc when I excert my will. How does one excert their will with finess. The delicacy of influencing others without causing quarrel. I am terrible at this. Oh how I plunge forward, leap without looking, jump recklessly with no concern for others.

      I think I have reached my americano limit. I had abstained. Denied myself the powers of jetfuel. Resisted from the potent brew. Withheld my desire to sip the nectar of the coffee gods. But not today. I gave into whimsy. Released my grip of the word no, blocking the passage down the smooth sides of throat allowing the warmth of a nice americano down. No, indeed, I did not resist. I had not 1 but 2. Not just one shot but 2. 4 god damn shots of rocket fuel and now I pay the price. The sweet cost of coffee elixer.  The silent buzz in the back of my neck, the hum of just the underside of my skin's surface, the jerk of my muscles as they spasm underneath all of the sensations of coffee ripping new pathways through my nerves. Unforgiving, unrelenting not willing to let me go just yet.   Can't I just sleep this off? Please..

      Today is my birthday. I slept at my friend Leslie's last night and now this morning, my birthday morning, I am here at Leslie's. So now I am 32. I feel terribly failed or fantastically successful at not achieving. What will I do? Where will I go from this point on? Where is my future? How will I find it?  And these questions lead me to think of this...

       Fun I had, lots of it, with you.  Silently slipping past theatrical gaurdians.  Striding circularly through chinese chaos. Late night nibbles on words. So many thoughts, that I don't sleep as you slumber nearby.  -Jillian    A friend and I snuck into a movie, got seperated in a chinese market, got snacks and talked about poetry late into the night and then had a slumber party. When I couldn't sleep barely at all I wrote that and left.

      This is an extension of the crocus poem. I think its about new day's breaking and and going through cycles of the day. And its about being on the beach waiting for the day to pass. And its about spring. And its about rebirth  sunshine yawning rain knocking  under dirt bark breaking bud's emerging breath lurking nearby  pebbles rolling waves groaning through sky blue splitting moments lifting beginnings lurking  life starting again

      Today, I commented to my yoga instructer that the sound of the water spinning round the wheel wells of cars moving past was creating anxiety inside. Ahh, he said, environmental noise. And later, Jabbar, another friend commented on the poetic motion of the statement. I thought, mmn, environmental noise makes for poetic thoughts.

       Favorite Leonard Cohen peoms found by accident again today:    Song  I almost went to bed without remembering the four white violets I put in the button-hole  of your green sweater  and how I kissed you then and you kissed me shy as though I'd  never been your lover  I like this poem so much for the innocence and simplicity found in the first few lines. There's an intimacy found there. Its like being in on a good love. It makes me feel like sunshine on a front porch with creaky floor boards run smooth with time.   and for inspiration:   The Only Poem  This is the only poem I can read I am the only one  can write it I didn't kill myself when things went wrong I didn't turn to drugs or teaching I tried to sleep but when I couldn't sleep I learned to write I learned to write what might be read  on nights like this by one like me  I liked this one for much of the same reason as the first. Because it too shares an intimacy. An inside on the ending is a nice touch in both poems. Right in the last lines, he reveals an identity and immmediatly you feel a belonging inside the poem. Or at least I did. I like L. Cohen. I've liked  Song  for years. I've always thought it was sweet.  Walked around in the grey skied day here in Vancouver. Took some photos of cherry blossums blooming. Made some comments and smiled at lots of strangers. Some days its easy to be available for small-talk and other days its unbearable to get out of bed. Why is it anhilating to think about starting? Anything even, the dishes becomes this monstrous endeavour. And then, thank god, I just start on something and keep going. And off on a roll I go and wont go anywhere until its done. Oh my, I wish it could all be a little more consistent. Routine is another topic on another day that I might didcuss. MMnnnn?

      A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselved, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly's supercilious blue and yellow yes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D.H.Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress. Several of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be properly considered offenses against taste and decency. Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person's lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one's soul.  -an excerpt from my favorite book in the whole world...A Conferderacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole

      I was walking around the farm today remembering all the other times I have been here. You know as far back as 4 years old. Its the same garage, the same trees, the same barn, everything. Today, I wished I had carved something, let a marker, a time bomb, a note written at 8 and tucked away behind a board, behind a pile of junk, forgotten until some wonderful night and the remeberance of having been here before.

      Spark died.  Spark was my fire engine red fighting fish who stopped fighting sometime in the night. Not well was spark, I knew. This was coming slowly around the bend. I think I can, I think I can. Except he couldn't. Slowly, he slowed down. He stopped flicking he red caboose tail at me. The way he did when playing coyly with the shadows of my presence.  Spark laid down last night on the cool rock bottom, as he has the last few days. Water wing feathers of red fluttering lightly at his sides. At least I knew he was still living. But last night those signs of life I glanced for were getting quiet. Yet consciousness still beat from beneath the scales of crimson shimmer.  I lifted the small flame from the bed of water with the small cold metal spoon. I had chased him with the same spoon days before. Wake up! Keep moving! Just make sure you move every day. Don't worry, you'll eat later. I raised him near the meniscus, near the food that he wasn't eating. Dehydrated worms bloated with fluid, gaining weight until eventually resting silently on the cool rock bed.  I knew it wouldn't be long. Life escaping, seeping out, slowing down. Where does it go?   Spark died sometime in the night while I slept and dreamt something..vague I remember barely. I woke up wanting to deny the daylight and its fore brooding presence.I Felt the need to relieve the digested fluids of the evening past. Pass on. Then I remembered the small spark of fishlife up there on the kitchen shelf, who once flicked his fire engine red tail at me while I did the dishes and washed potatoes.  Did I need to flush him too?

      "Sharp paper edges that slid across my fingertips, slicing under the surface. Not deep enough to draw more than a speck of blood though. The kind of cut that snags on your woolen sweater when I want to wrap myself around you. Damn it, I exasperate and readjust my embrace."  The chances of hurting me are not high. And I don't feel sorry, stupid or guilty. Mistakes or errors of judgment are just what they are. Kind of like a favorite pair of jeans you ripped, you can mend them and patch them and like it or not they're different. Love them for every torn seam or don't. Throw them away and swear you won't buy that brand again or maybe its the pair that fits you the best. Life's like that for me. About acceptance and being comfortable in my skin.(However, I'm not always good at it.) Loving the things that matter even the bits that hurt, that resonate and hopefully staying on course.   I stayed at my friend Curtis' last night. He lets me use his computer. I stayed up way too late writing, slept in my clothes on a couch that slowly pulls apart from the slightest movement. Blinding light searing across my face way too early and a groggy half cup of coffee. I write my best analogies and poetic ramblings when I'm sleepy in rumpled clothes.  Somewhere, latent talents have emerged.  "When I first saw her it was as though my heart jumped up in my throat, landed on my sleeve and stayed stitched there mysteriously. Held there with the invisible ties that bind. Bleeding from the small pin pricks that held it in place."  I seriously have to wake up.  ever, jillian ps. my little burgeoning hat business has started. Sold one already and onto another. There's a theory, you become what you know the most. Did it ever evade me that I would become a milliner?

      For those of you who care and for those of you who don't and finally for those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, I present the following 6 numbers:  1-5-3-6-2-4  The firing order for a slant 6. Mess these numbers up and Rose don't run no more.

      Today I engaged in one of my favorite past times, something I can never get enough of. I can spend hours and hours in search of the perfect bra. So, today I ventured forth towards the mountain of lingerie choices facing me in today's society.   There are pink ones, purple ones, shocking red ones, glow in the dark white and every color in between. They lift and some seperate. No support or semi support or extra support.  How do I decide? Today I don't feel like I need a lot of support but other days I'm in desperate need of a pick me up.Sizes scanning the first 4 letters of the alphabet and little fraction like numbers. Why didn't they tell me in math class my skills could help me one day find the bra for me.  Bras for tshirts and bras for strapless dresses. Some are for the gym and some are for sleeping. Frilly lace things and little embroidered flowers, fancy straps and an array of different closures that are obviously designed to stump even the most dextrous of teenage boys. Bras for little girls and bras for really big girls. And if you're not so big but want to be you can get a bra that will help you out in ways that no other piece of clothing can do.   The bras for the boob challenged can mold you into a whole new woman. They're actually breasts you can attach to your own. Perfect mound sphericals hiding behind the facade of white lace. They stand up firm and round everyday, no matter how you feel. Molded foam rubber made in such a way to suggest ample fat tissue resides just under neath that thin film of tshirt material. They give the impression of perfect nippleless breasts that somehow silently remind me of my barbie doll's boobs. Non-jiggling, non-sagging all the time perfect tits.   But if you want the jiggle, you can get help for that too with your brand new manufactured strap to your body boobs. Some bras even come with a little bag of jiggly jelly like material that makes your firm foam breasts bounce and will probably decieve even further the man attached to the hands as he attempts to answer his internal burning question of 'I wonder what those feel like'. Well, I'll tell ya. They feel like nippleless foam moulds with a bag of jelly in them.   So, after slowly taking in the sights, colours, textures and maddening selection I pulled myself away from my favorite pastime to wander on to pushing my parts into another favorite item of deception and allure. The Shoe.   As I tried on a few pairs of ridiculous, ankle breaking, toe squishing, height adjusting creations of modern man, I passively listened to the following announcement:  Hello Ladies..Is your bra uncomfortable? Find the straps digging in, back aches later in the day? Join us on Friday between 3-5 and consulte with our Wonder Bra Experts and let us help you find the bra that fits you best. But then I wondered why we force ourselves into these uniforms of womanhood, bind ourselves in poor fitting shoes to overstuffed bras, only to need the help of a 'professional'. Is that what I need? A professional to 'help me' find my perfect bra?  I'm getting out of the mall that wants to push me through a machine and make me come out the other side with perfect boobs and longer legs and smoother skin and bigger poutier lips. I like the small boobed, flat footed, makeupless, fashion scentless woman I am already. mmnn?

      The other day my mother remarked that she wanted to sell her dishes for no good reason except to get new and different ones and asked me what I thought. I told her that life was too short to be with a dish you didn't like.

      I feel like a seed buried in the deep warm earth. Protected by the pressure on all sides of me. Nurtured by fluid of the tears I've shed in the last couple of months. Trying to get myself to burst through. Break through the thin skin holding me back. Sprout. Push my way up, shove the comforting dirt out of the way. Find light and grow. Soak up the sustenance from the sky and not from within. Become.

      When I finally pulled myself away from the screen of many letters, I found that I was too late for Thai Away. I hope that you did not scheme and plot, knowing full well the operating hours of said establishment, prompting me to stay that one second longer with offers of optical observations.   However, along the way, I found my friend artist extraordinaire Mark Gaskin. Beckoning me to his presence with the help of a black man named Norman, I found him at his usual spot at the bar of Wazubees. A laugh, a gurgle and a mumble later plused with an rather substantial hug, I glanced at the dishonestly priced menu of thrashed fusion fare. This moment of stoppage may in fact have been the deciding factor in my inability to quench the craving for Thai spice. The throbbing bass tones of unrecognizable but incomprehensibly familiar club music making my eyes hurt, I ventured reluctantly on my way. Still in desire for spicy soup, but in debate for funny and ricocheting dialogue, I found myself on the corner talking to 2 street punks who had only moments before been bestowed with gourmet sandwiches on a catering tray. Need food must press on, murmurings from a distant Thai Away were getting fainter.  Upon my finding disappointment from the sight of upturned chairs and a lone employee mopping the floors, I knew my chances were getting slim. I needed nourishment, I was fading. Hallucinations of wet, dismembered limbs frolicking in burnt lasagna from cardboard packages were haunting me. Onward I stalked the wet asphalt beneath my fluvoged feet.  Thai was not to be my gourmet lover tonight. I would have to find another delight. Deserts whispered sweet nothings in my ear but its aromas didn't reach me enough to tempt me. Not until I walked on by a former one night stand that I new I had found what I needed to satiate my appetite this evening. Chicken Tikka and me had a round of nibbles and bites.   I chewed lovingly on his tender morsels of spiced breast of fowl. Dipped them slowly through the cooling yogurt, wrapped them carefully with the blanket of Naan and put them to bed on my taste bud tingling tongue. Ahhh. The mÈnage et toi of bread, sauce and meat lingered and danced, swirling underneath my senses. Slowly they warmed me up from top to bottom, fulfilling my nourishment needs. We were lovers once again, my old friend Tikka and me.  Unfortunatly, his price has gone up and I'm going home alone.

      The train, like the sky, reminds me of any place any time. The stars are the same no matter where you are and the squeel of wheels on rails never changes. When I'm on a train, the sway and momentum and my eyes closed and I'm in another city, another tunnel, a Paris subway sation. Pretend that the announcements are in spanish. the words on those advertisments don't look familiar. A subway is a subway is a subway.   As I get off a young girl on rollerskates glides by. Fresh. Alive. And with french accent and that slides my thoughts further and I   am   in Paris.   Walked into a store a few moments later and a lyric about a long red dress is sung and it coincides with my long red coat. A shirt drops to the floor and the sales guy says..I'll look after that, they tend to jump out towards people. I say.. I'll say, pick up the shirt and it has hand embroidered LOVE written on it and I think all that is meant to be happening is and its always a perfect moment when I pay attention.

      I saw Farenheit 9-11 the other day. I took my friend Heather for her birthday. A beautiful and sunny Saturday and all was well. 2 hours later a hole had been ripped in the cheap veneer of the false reality I had considered to be somewhat true. The fantasy of my percieved reality poured through the tear like the blood through the sheared flesh of my knee after it shredded along the rough pavement of the decrepet east van step last week. Like then, I could do nothing more than wince from the wound, and maybe shed a few tears. Eventually I just had to shrug my shoulders and get up and go on my way. As it was then, I said to myself upon leaving the theatre, "What can I do? I guess I'll find a bandaid later."
