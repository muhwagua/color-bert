      I've been reading alot of the information regarding what's been going on in the world and I am left with two prevailing emotions.  One is anger and the other is fear.  The terrorists won.  No matter what decisions America makes from this point on it is a losing battle.  Why do people use brilliance for evil?

      Okay....I better settle in....this is gonna be a long one...  I realize now that I am lazy and unmotivated....you see, as I type this, I should be in the Gross Anatomy lab studying every single cadaver in the room until I know every nerve, artery, duct, muscle, etc. in Back and Head/Neck I down cold.....but I'm up here by the window in this computer lab....typing in this blog that no one but me and two other people even know exists....why am I up here in this computer lab?....I took my new Miles Davis CD out of the CD player (Milestones....great music....) and replaced it with nothing....I could listen to Jigga again but I listen to it 3 times a day....the novelty is wearing thin and, as is usually the case, the ignorance and excess is beginning to show....  I found another blog to frequent.... urlLink Crystal  has quite a few nice blogs linked to her site but I think I have found a winner in  urlLink "Kelly" ....her musical tastes are similar to my own (I'm making this inference on what is listed in her Bio....not her weekly critique in the main blogs....) and I like her style....  as much time as I'm beginning to spend in the lab I think I am going to have to relinquish this excuse of not having enough time to design this site and chalk it up to laziness.....but what is new....  Which brings me full circle....why am I not downstairs peering into the skull of a dead person to try and find the abducens nerve?....well my classmates who I love, adore, admire, etc. are starting to annoy the holy hell out of me....they seem to be under the dillusion that I am an all knowing Gross Anatomy God and want me to help them find structures on their bodies....I ordinarily wouldn't be so frustrated with being in demand from dozens of lovely ladies, there is just one small problem....I DON'T KNOW THE STUFF!!....I'm not b.s.ing....I missed 21 questions on the Mock Practical.....but to my classmates I'm exaggerating, I'm grouchy, I'm selfish....nah shawty....I want to do better cuz the more I know the more I can give.....but they have frustrated me and forced me to go into hiding on the internet because I cannot express myself vocally to them in any non-offensive manner....  On to other thoughts....I am flirting with the notion of telling other people about this site....I have been assaulted by all sorts of thoughts from my evil mind about my motive for even creating this site....the only answer I can give myself is that I have created a need to write which last year was fostered by the newspaper and this year until recently had not been met....I also am coming to grips with the fact that despite (and maybe even because of) my vast insecurities I have a massive ego and I need to be shown approval....who knows....certainly not me....  Anyways this mindless rant is over now....I may meander down to the lab eventually....I may not....

      Let's talk about fiction....better yet when fiction becomes non-fiction....I read alot of Tom Clancy....granted the last book of his I read was  Executive Orders  which I finished about two days after I finished  Without Remorse ....anyways not much has been said of his book  Debt of Honor  which had roughly the same plotline as the recent national tragedy....of course I am sure Mr. Clancy needed a spectacular ending to his book as well as an unbelievable plot twist to get Jack Ryan (think Harrison Ford in Clear and Present Danger and Patrior Games or Alec Baldwin in The Hunt For Red October) in the office of President of the United States....but the striking similarities between his book and what happened in NY and DC cannot be ignored....here is what scares me.....in the book right before  Debt ,  The Sum of All Fears , terrorists try (semisuccessfully) to detonate a nuclear device in Denver at a major sporting event (I want to say an NFL playoff game)....imagine the terror....and to those who don't think it can happen....did you ever imagine the WTC collapsing?  Exactly....

      Okay two great things happened last night....1)I found a movie I have been searching for over a 2 and a half year period....Higher Learning.....is Higher Learning one of my top ten movies ever?....not quite....I think it was more about the fact that I always get what I am looking for eventually and Higher Learning has eluded me more than anything in my life not named I.R. (story for another day)....2) I bought the new Jay Z album.  I consider myself an expert on musical critique.  I have been involved in some controversial debates (most notably my proclamation that LL Cool J is overall the best rapper of the early era (not up for debate anymore).  Well Jay has officially become the best rapper of the new era with this album.  Witness track two "Takeover" where he lyrically demolishes all competition, past, present, and future, small and large, minor and major.  Need more evidence?  Disregard the radio friendly (yet still unbelieveably high quality) lead single Izzo (H.O.V.A.).  Girls, Girls, Girls is the truth.  I could go track by track, but instead I will say buy the album.  It's this year's Stankonia as far as I'm concerned.

      Today was a wasted day....the cable is  STILL  off (thanks alot Stacey!), so I couldn't watch the games....the only game I saw a minute of was the Georgia Tech game...and I was happy at that very moment because they scored, but I remember thinking as they scored, "Man they should have eaten a little more of the clock up there"....sure enough I come back upstairs from the lab and the losers have lost to Clemson....being a fan sucks!....at least the Braves won....  Since the cable was out I took the oppurtunity to watch Snatch....it was pretty funny....not as funny as the level people had hyped it to, but it had it's quality moment....I'd give it a 7 out of 10....  Last night, on an impulse I went to a step show....man....I should have known it would turn into a clownfest....I went with 5 girls (a story in and of itself)....and one of them has this guy she messes with and for the first time I noticed that this niggas head is on some massive proportion type shit....I'm talking bout I couldn't make up what kind of shoes he had on, he was that far away, but his head looked like he was right in my face....I mean dude's head is massive....then one of them said, "Look, there is Fetus!"....at that moment I had to check myself cuz I could not believe that she had just called a nigga Fetus....so I asked her if that was what she said and she said yeah....I almost died laughing....then I asked was that his name and she was like, "No, he just looks sorta like a Fetus"....now maybe I have spent one too many hours in Dr. Dereimer's Embryology lecture but that was the funniest thing ever....anyway the various jokes cracked almost made up for the fact that A Phi A, AKA, DST, and Que Psi Phi did not participate in the "step show"....how are you gonna have a step show without the Big Four???....bullshit I tell you....not to mention the bootleg dancing groups and singers they had up there....lets put it this way....when I left I did not care who had won....  Oh well....time to head back down into the dungeon that is Gross Lab

      Okay.... urlLink this post here ....is STRAIGHT comedy....I cannot go wrong starting my day by reading Kelly's joint....  I officially have a spending problem....I bought my 7th DVD of the month yesterday (it was the quality flick Snatch)....folks there is a definate problem here....the thing that scares me is that as soon as I buy one DVD I want, 3 more pop up in my head (T2, Jungle Fever, and Carlito's Way)  OJ, I usually don't address allegations of "wrist drop" (inside med school joke....I'll explain if you want to know), however you raise a valid point....niggas usually do not brag about CK pants....however these are no ordinary pair of pants....they are silk lined suit pants made from the finest something or the other....please believe the ladies were liking them dude!  which brings me to my next point....why was I treating the lab partner to dinner at Chili's (minor caking....and that leads to a story for another post) and I start to go into my normal routine about who the cute girls in our class are....and I realize it's too many fine ladies in my class for me to be single at this point....all future doctors and dentists too!....I am slipping....  Okay back to DVDs....so I watched Memento yesterday....maybe it was the fatigue setting in or whatever but I was left kind of bewildered....I mean don't get me wrong....I understood the jist of the movie but for the first time in years, (probably since I was 11 and saw Silence of the Lambs for the first time...) I was left dazed afterward....has anyone else seen this movie?....am I just losing my touch?  Why was I compelled to defy my incredibly slow AOL dial up connection at the crib and download "Differences" by Ginuwine?....normally his voice inspires me to throw things but I am really feeling this song....I mean I'm walking around singing off key, "My whole life has changed"....maybe it was the fact that our cable went out....  Never will a roommate 6 months removed cause the Killa to be cableless again....my roommate and good buddy Crystal's last roommate is a complete jackass who did not pay her share of the cable, ummm, sometime LAST YEAR!....so now comcast's bootleg ass has decided to deprive me of my Howard Stern fix....damn them!  Lastly, why has no one heard the top secret and ultra hot Girls, Girls, Girls remix at the very end of The Blueprint?....it's the absolute hotness!....trust me on that one....the dude singing in the intro is wilding....it's some song from the 70's and the dude says, "I'm not a one girl's guy/and they know it/when it comes to love I don't lie/and the girls respect me for it/ain't gonna say my nose can't be open/but right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from..."and then the hot beat kicks in....it starts 7:52 into track 13 and is well worth the effort....  I have the feeling I'll be back posting soon....just seems like one of those Limp Bizkit "Break Stuff" days....holla!

      Somebody....anybody....please tell me what is the deal with these "wishlists"?....I mean do people actually send you things that you ask for?....Do they expect anything in return?....is it like how it is with the front door at the club, only works for ladies?....or can a guy like me reap the fringe benefits?....I will give some psycho a minute or two of conversation if they will support my 2 a month DVD habit....any takers out there?....let me know please, someone in the know!  Okay why am I so fly today....usually I don't toot my own horn but I have to admit I look the part!....I have on my spotless white coat and a shirt and tie picked out especialy to accentuate my charcoal Calvin Klien pants....I am the man!  Me and the homie Nicole (I hope you can find a spare minute or two for a brother over Christmas break :-)...) are having  a "discussion" about the trend towards these Black male authors writing these pseudodrama novels....I find the whole thing to be terribly exploitive and a waste of trees....almost as bad as Terry McMillan (there is no way one good black male per novel can balance out the negative examples she throws at you)....I can't figure out who is doing more damage to the psyche of black males....it seems that the only characters with positive characterizations are a)men who are already married and serve as the token "good black man", b)gay and proud,  c)a child or son who has yet to be tainted by the evil that is manhood, or d)the one who makes a dramatic change for the better?....Black males get bashed enough in the media...anyway that's just my humble opinion....  On a completely different note....I am trying to figure out why I like Howard Stern's show so much....I mean he is blatently exploitative....he makes fun of the mentally and physically challenged....yet I get a kick out of watching him and Beetlejuice and Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf(RIP)....sometimes he is downright disgusting....but I can't figure it out....I guess we all have our vices, and my enjoyment of Howard is mine....

      Okay....Michael Jordan is coming back....I just performed my first impulse shopping with a credit card to commemorate his return....yes I have purchased his Wizards jersey from Eastbay....it will be here in 3-7 days...I really wish Nashville had a basketball team so I could see him play....I have to admit I hated the Bulls winning all of those championships but watching Michael Jordan play is the greatest...  I am really angry with the randomizer on winamp...I currently have a playlist of 595 songs (I call it slow mix...it's of the quiet storm variety) and yet it seems to play the same 20 or 30 songs when I am in the room....I put the songs on the list cuz I wanted to hear them....dammit!....(why do I like Blaque's version of "Time After Time"....and why did my winamp  FINALLY  play Duran Duran's "Come Undone"....)...what's that? You want a link to my  urlLink complete playlist ?.....be warned it is over 50 printed pages long....and takes a hot minute to completely download....  About Jeff George getting cut....it was inevitable....the Deadskins will stink the joint up all year but at least they won't have to deal with George's arrogance to boot....  Why did today go by so fast....it seems the days I am in the lab drag on and on....I go to the ICU tomorrow and I get to wear a shirt and tie and my white coat and look like a real doctor....  I am strongly considering joining Columbia House to get a few DVDs....any of you select few who read this please give me your input, yea or nay.  I got a chance to talk to the homies Kasi and JC today....I really am blessed to have been able to establish great friendships in undergrad....I can't wait for homecoming, not only because I will get to pick up the car, but to see the old crew....  My room smells really good right now, I am glad I decided to get that melon scented candle....now if I could do something about this cold temperature....  Well lets see what I can whip up in the kitchen....how appropriate that I am about to publish this and Stevie Wonder's "Rocket Love" starts to play....winamp has redeemed itself...

      Last night...oh boy....I think my first mistake was buying the bottle of Grey Goose....I don't know what I said to some of my classmates at O'Charlie's....  Celebrating the end of the block is one thing but I went waaaay too far....I just hope there are no major reprecussions....  I think I did reasonablly well on my practical yesterday....I had questions about 10 of the answers but I should be okay, that puts me in B range which is what I need....  Sorry Dani for getting the city wrong....that means you are a true down south Georgia girl though since you repping the home of Pastor Troy...  Well I'll probably blog a little later on..for now I'm going to read what other folks have to say!

      Okay I found another good blog reading OJ's....the good thing about this girl ( Dani )is she is from my hometown....good ole  Atlanta, GA .....God I miss Atlanta....it is cold here in Nashville and just cannot seem to find the interesting black women....it would seem like a future physician would be on easy street as far as the ladies go but my love life is like zilch....nadda....nothing....Man I miss Dear Old  Morehouse ....there is nothing like waking up getting "So Fresh and So Clean" and heading over to the beautiful land of  Spelman ....So many intelligent black females centrally located and (for the majority) trying to do something...anyway enough complaining....gotta take this practical in an hour...the upperclassmen have been really encouraging.....but I still don't know how I feel about accepting mediocrity....I know one thing though...I know my shit....I'm on top of my game....and I will be a helluva doctor....pleaze believe it!  Out for now!

      Today was a looooooong day....I took the written test for block 2 of Gross Anatomy....despite what all the second year students are telling me, I am very disappointed in myself....I passed the test which is more than many of my classmates can say but I want A's....I work too hard to not get A's....  I realized last night that the reason I am so intent on writing regularly in this blog is that I miss writing for the Maroon Tiger....Writing articles for the paper took alot out of me, but the feeling of seeing my writing in print and knowing it was meaningful to someone somewhere meant alot to me....  I have been in the lab for 7 hours and I have decided that I know all that I am going to know about the Head and Neck as well as the deep muscles of the Back....Dr. Jackson hit us with some crazy stuff today....but foolishness or not, tomorrow I will have my A, pleaze believe it....  A few thoughts on the weekend football....how bout them 'Noles?....You talk about someone laughing their ass off....I was one happy dude....I just hope Carolina doesn't do that to the Jackets or we are gonna have a problem....that song from the Wizard of Oz comes to mind....Ding Dong the Witch is dead...yes indeed!....The Falcons won which is always good and Michael Vick scored his first touchdown, but the thing that has me feeling really good is the fact that Jamal Anderson is playing well....of course he put up a good showing against the Panthers last year and it was all down hill but we shall see....I am willing to give him ethe benefit of the doubt...Now to some random thoughts....The Dolphins, Jags, Packers, Broncos, Rams, Raiders (happy OJ?), and Eagles are all legit contenders....The Chargers and Bengals will surprise....the Ravens, Bucs, Vikings, and Titans will disappoint...all in all it should be a good season....  Crystal is gone again....she is an enigma....her blog is always interesting reading but she is never around that long....oh well....at least I discovered some good ones through her...

      I just remember what has been bugging me all day....I get home last night and there is a postcard in the mailbox addressed to me from  urlLink Eastbay ....now at this moment I go....hmmm....I have been expecting to recieve my Jordan jersey for a while seeing as how I ordered it a week ago....so I get this card telling my how they are backlogged and when they recieve more from the manufacturer they will send within 48 hours of thier receipt from them.....now my thing is this....if you don't have any jerseys available you need to let the consumer (i.e. me!) know so he won't be going around distrusting his ghetto ass neighbors and ready to haul off and whup up on the first person in the hood wearing a Wizards jersey....  I am seriously procrastinating right now....I don't exactely feel like heading to the lab right this second....sometimes I just wish that all of the fat and facsia would just melt away in the middle of one night....leaving me with a perfect dissection....yeah right!....anyways enough putting off of the inevitable....

       urlLink I couldn't have said it better ....Me and the homie Corey are having a discussion as to whether  urlLink  Smoove B  is a poor man's Pootie Tang or a more eloquent Ladie's Man....since I indefinately am without my Howard fix I believe Smoove will fill in nicely....  In other news I have taken up running about a mile in the morning and in the evening....I have also decided to drink the much hyped 8 cups of water daily....have I gone crazy?....mayhaps....  I really enjoyed talking with  urlLink Dani   yesterday....she is really cool peeps with some substance to her....not to mention that she is kinda fly....  Anyways I shall continue listening to Alanis and go about the rest of my day....

      I found  urlLink Resha's site  while reading  urlLink Dani's blog .  I must say that both of these ladies are my type of women.  Too bad I'm in Nashville now, eh?  I have come to the conclusion that I will have to be satisfied with the rather bland look of this site for another 3 or 4 months because my time is really at a premium.  I have found time to read my ever increasing list of favorite blogs and check my e-mail daily, but that's about it.  That appears to be the way life will be for awhile in Student Doctor Killa Cal's life (alot going on in that sentance).  Just found....an archive of smoove writings by  urlLink  Smoove B .  If I could verbalize my macking like him I wouldn't be in the situation I am in now!  Laterz!

      Quick thoughts....  Am I wrong to be happy to be an American?....I mean true, Black men are not favored in American society, but I can't think of another place where I would have the opportunity to make money and live my life the way I want to....can you?  Am I the only 22 year old Black Male who still loves Saved By The Bell?....I will sit and watch any episode no matter how many times I have seen it before....  Speaking of Saved By The Bell, whatever became of Lark Voorhies?....Last I saw her she was making arabesque movies....  I remember once upon a time I had the following celebrity crushes, all around the same time: Halle Berry, Lark Voorhies, Tatyana Ali, Stacey Dash, Veronica Webb, Naomi Campbell, Tyra Banks, Aaliyah (R.I.P. babygirl), Monica, and Brandy (what was I thinking?)....now I'm hard pressed to think of any black celeb I'm attracted to besides the entire female cast of The Best Man (including Shelby, but strangely not Nia Long)....might I be growing up?....naaaaah....  Newsflash....these new J's still feel like Heaven on my feet.....  I feel like a complete and total jackass cuz I forgot about my best friend Eulus's birthday yesterday....granted yesterday was a hectic day....but there is really no excuse....I suck right now....I'll make it up though....  I think that's it for now....

      "Da Mayor we need your leadership"- Buggin' Out in  Do the Right Thing  I watched the end of  Do the Right Thing  yesterday....it's the only Spike Lee movie with a decent ending....if I ever get a chance to sit down and talk to Spike Lee (one of my personal heroes), I am going to ask him what he thought of Mookie's actions....for the record I don't think he did "the right thing"....  Okay....I feel regret about talking about dude's big head....that was foul of me....that will have to suffice for an apology since he doesn't know about this site, nor would he care other than the fact that I dogged him out....  Guess whose cable is still out?....Guess whose refrigerator has decided to go the way of the cable?....Guess who is about to shell out about $800 for a new one?....if you guessed Killa Cal for all three, I have a hero cookie for you....being a "grown folk" officially sucks now....  The Dolphins got shalacked but the Falcons won....I was only able to watch one of the games and it was the bad one....  Saturday night after I blogged I went to the class party....it was pretty off the chain....I had alot of fun....I was surprised by the "Bout-it-ness" of some of the girls in the class....one girl in particular had me reeling after I danced with her....I made a mental note to find her at every future class party for at least one dance....drinks were free and I have concluded that when I want to, I can remain sober and have fun....I was worried for a second to be honest....  Today seems like it is going to be a long day....again....I need something in my life....I can't figure out what it is....I'll know by the end of the day....  By the way....I am in the Newsweek "Best Colleges" issue....I don't know what page.....but it's an ad for Honda Motor Corporation.....I am answering a question at a quiz bowl tournament that my team (Morehouse College) won....I have my head turned talking to the captain....it's an interesting picture....my friend who is in the advertising business tells me that this is Newsweek's #1 selling issue....

      I have alot to say on this rainy Saturday afternoon so bare with me....  First things first.....how bout those Braves?....they swept the Stros like I said they would....Look out D-Backs or Cards (it matters not which one)....  MJ played his first game for the Wiz last night....I guess I was somewhat impressed with his performance....not vintage Jordan but not too far off either....  Tennessee State and Vanderbilt are both having homecoming festivities this weekend....I stay right behind TSU so imagine the onslaught of traffic I face as my usual 2 minute commute turns into 5....  I am getting ready for this Gross Anatomy test....if people only knew how much stuff goes on in the Head and Neck region....  I am taking a small break tonight however to check out the craziest Black man in America, Mike Tyson.....I will let  urlLink these comments  say the rest....tsk, tsk....Only in America indeed!  I've been reading my old articles from the Maroon Tiger and I realize what a great time I had in undergrad....Med school so far has been an adventure....but I will never, ever get to have as much fun as I did in undergrad....  This anthrax scare really has me bugging out....as a future health professional I want to run my ass up to Metro General Hospital and get the vaccine ASAP....no use in effing around!  Oh well this post wasn't as long as I thought it would be....maybe I'll be back later....

      Big news at  urlLink Spelman ....I can't say I'm all that surprised although I didn't expect Dr. Manley to leave before Dr. Massey left  urlLink Morehouse ....  In other news of the "I told you so" type, the Braves are one step closer to sweeping the Astros....this is the Braves year....  Oh well....I'm going to check out OJ's site now since he claims "it might be up"....later!

       urlLink Amiri Baraka  is an interesting dude....he's been through just about every kind of conflicting thought pattern that a Black man can experience....I can relate to alot of what he has written and I also wholeheartedly disagree with alot of what he has said....he reminds me of what I read in Eldridge Clever's  Soul On Ice ....I seem to even remember Eldridge quoting him....Baraka's name just popped up in my mind today as random things often do....  There is nothing like conversation with a woman who has knowledge of self....if I some of these ladies I interact with here could gain that last bit of essential character, I might be able to do the impossible and find a wife....  Lastly....I don't know why this popped into my mind....but I am kind of saddened by the disintegration of the once mighty Wu Tang Clan....I think back to when I was a die hard fan of the Wu and really thought they were invincible....now they are nowhere to be found....OJ where have all the heroes gone?

      okay there looks to be no way for me to eleminate this little double post blemish....oh well I'm not being graded on it and I did make the compulsory effort to try and remove it so I guess I'll have to live with it....Not like this was a page renowned for its display of excellent HTML....  I'm sure I'll have something more to say a little later....  (addendum) Well the double post is removed....however now OJ and Shanna's little conversation is out in the ether of the internet world....I think it's a fair trade off...LOL....

       urlLink Censorship  is a beast....I'm glad I'm not important enough for the big wigs in media to come after me and pull my pages cuz of how I feel....I get the  urlLink Boondocks  everyday in my e-mail so I'm already knowing about the various controversies that Brother McGruder has been embroiled in....it's just not right....but still I'd rather be here than anywhere else....at least till my boy Damien gets the reigns in  urlLink Anguilla ....  The  urlLink Braves  won today!!....I'm telling ya'll, people are sleeping on them but will win the World Series!  I went to  urlLink Brooks Brothers  earlier and got another of the Golden Fleece polo shirts that feel so wonderfully....unfortunately I got a large and wear an extra large so it looks like I need to go back to Green Hills Mall and exchange it....  Looks like I'm going back to  urlLink Starbucks  tonight for more study time....yeah buddy!!!...start making your appointments now cuz Dr. Smith is gonna be world class!

      Bootleggedness....why must the element of bootleggedness always be present in the midst of something Black....for instance....my school charges us for laptops....you think I'm getting a top of the line Dell?....or maybe an iMac?....nah, I'm getting a 2000 Gateway with Windows 98, and I had to beg for a DVD-Rom....that is akin to charging me for a car and then giving me a Ford Fiesta....thanks alot Meharry....  The bootleggedness doesn't stop there.....the printer in the computer lab is out of toner....they gave a tour of the gross anatomy lab yesterday to some high school kids who looked like they had just come back from a Marilyn Manson concert....yeah that's just what these kids need to see....some dead bodies with their innards poking out....that'll set em straight!  Anyway enough of my complaining....  WARNING!!!....Football and sports are about to get their weekly due....if you don't care about sports hit back on your browser.....  Okay....My Falcons got drubbed by the lowly Bears....I'm sure Billy Cade was hitting backflips in Chapel Hill....I am hard pressed to think of a season that looked so bleak so early....all I can hope is that Mike Vick hangs in there and doesn't give up....The Dolphins resumed their winning ways by beating up on the New England Patriots....that almost gets the bad taste out of my mouth from the smackdown the Rams laid....Tennessee is in mourning right now because the Titans are 0-3 (indifferent is Killa Cal) and the 6th ranked Vols lost to the Georgia Bulldogs....I don't know how I feel about college football right now....I really thought Ga Tech had a legitimate shot at the national championship....Miami is my only hope right now.....let's hope the Seminoles don't find the game they lost in Chapel Hill....okay....the sports section is over....  In other news....I studied at Starbucks last night....had a Caramel Macchiotto....it was pretty good, but the coffee did a number on me when I went home and did my jogging....cramp city!....lesson learned, no coffee before running....Starbucks is a pretty cool place to study though, especially since there is no Barnes and Noble that I know of....  Apparently I am knee deep in an old school revival....I have pulled out the old trusty walkman and the tapes I made senior year of high school and freshman year of college....some of the highlights of this tape:  BBD (I Thought It Was Me?), Do Me, When Will I See You Smile Again, Always-Pebbles, Yours-Shai, and a host of George Benson songs....sandwiched by Gravediggaz, Mobb Deep, and Thug Luv by 2Pac and Bone....it gets no more random than that my friends.....  Oh well....enough for now....

      I've found another great blog c/o  urlLink Kelly .... urlLink Daana  has some interesting things to say....more than anything else though she and I share the same favorite artist.... urlLink Stevie Wonder ....take a look at my  urlLink complete MP3 list  and see how much Stevie I have....I had to make up for all the great songs they simply couldn't put on the  urlLink Song Review ....  I'm listening to the latest  urlLink Destiny's Child  effort right now....I can see how my little sister Che can get behind them....they are okay I guess....  Damn!!....Fire Drill and shit....gotta go!

      Weeeeelllll (in a horrible Tom Joyner, after listening to "It's Your World", voice)....our military has decided to  urlLink attack  Afghanistan...I really want to throw up a prayer for all of us....this could get uglier than Bubba Sparxxx (not the song....just him....oh and the video)....  My boy  urlLink Barry Bonds   has broken Mark McGwire's 3 year old single season home run record and I couldn't be happier....Barry is my kind of dude....he does his job and doesn't too much care about anything else but doing the best he can do....I really wish he could win a title....I predicted that he would do well in the school paper earlier this year so count me among those who aren't surprised at all....  Oh will post tomorrow about the weekend in football...peace!

      Sunday was uneventful....studied....went to Wal-Mart....  Wait a minute....I went out to eat at Outback for my friend's birthday....  Today....I flunked a test for the first time in Med School....it sucks to get a 54....especially after you studied your ass off....  The Yankees are like Cockroaches, can't get rid of them....  I found a hilarious Osama Bin Ladan vs. Mr. T website the other night but I can't find it now....oh well....  I'm not in a particularly good mood now so I'll be out...later!

      I'm back....actually I didn't go anywhere yet....  I am going HOME this weekend....good ole ATL....the event Morehouse's homecoming 2001....my first Homecoming as an Alumnus!!!!!!  In other news....I have switched lab tables....my new lab partner has likened it to a mid season trade in the NBA....he says I should average a solid 10 ppg. and 6 rpg. and I'm a solid addition to the team....I love it over there although I am kind of hurt by the new name my former lab partner has given me...."Benedict Cal".....I suppose it is better than "Batter Daddy" though....  I am officially a  urlLink Kelly  groupie....I read her blog every single day without fail....my routine is now to check my e-mail and then go directly to her site....do not pass go....do not collect $200....she is so real....she reminds me of my sisters along with a dash of my roommate....  Well let me get some studying done cuz this weekend I'm going to be in the MIX....

      I went through half of yesterday before I realized it was Halloween....I look back on my life and as a kid I would absolutely trip out over Halloween and now as a 22 year old man it passed with a whimper....  I went to Fridays last night and have decided that there is officially no restuarant in Davidson County, Tennessee that really wants Black customers....last night I was with a group of the most civil people in my class (mind you I usually hang with some wild folks and so I was giving the managers the benefit of the doubt) and our service was yet again horrible....  It's the same story everywhere we go....P.F. Chang, Outback, The Cooker, Chili's....I mean if I go one on one or maybe with 3 it's fine....but let us get a group of 6 or more and there are problems....the thing is I've been in many of these restuarants on other occassions and seen how large groups from Vanderbilt or white business people are treated and it doesn't compare....often they are even wilder than our groups could ever imagine, yet they get the benefit of the doubt....  So Killa Cal is through with Nashville eating establishments in large groups....it's pot luck or bust....

      When it rains it pours....  As I typed my last entry, my personal space was violated....someone entered my home and took small items, but even more frightening took whatever sense of security I had in that little shack....  My roommate is shook....I am shook....our parents are shook....and thus ends our happy home....it is very highly likely that I will move into a far more expensive, but also far more conveniant (and yes, safe) apartment in the Meharry Towers, the closest thing to student housing that we have here....  This morning I bent my key as the door was closing....a bent key.....yeah that just about sums me up right about now....you figure it out....

      Homecoming.....ahhh Homecoming....  Where to begin....I'll just do a blow by blow....that should suffice....it's long....  I got on the road about 4 PM Nashville time riding with my friend Tiffany B....the ride was pretty great...Jay Z got us the majority of the way there....I also realized that "Rock the Boat" is fast becoming one of my all time favorites....and of course I can never ride with Tiff without listening to R. Kelly's latest....I loves it....  Got to Atlanta about 9 or 10 local time(I think we made good time)....went to Walmart and got a few items and then headed directly to Hard Rock Cafe....the first person I saw was my boy Farai....kind of fitting given that Tiff and I had just mentioned him....it hit me right then how happy I was to be back among my lifelong friends....I get in line at Hard Rock and all of a sudden I see too many people....so many people I can't greet them all at once....it kind of overwhelmed me....  As the night went on it got better and better....I saw my girl Brandy as soon as I entered the actual building....I had seen my boys Raj, Darrell, and Kasi in line....by the end of the night I had seen just about everyone I cared about except my MAIN crew....  I decided that despite the fact that it was 3 AM I was determined to see my boys so I called them up and B. Clayton was the only one awake....but I went anyway....it made my night....of course I still hadn't seen my best friend, my dawg, my oldest friend, Eulus....  Next day I wake up and go work out at Tiffany's APT. complex's very nice CardioTheatre (wonderful concept)....then she dropped me off at my boy Danny's crib....man....elated is not the word to describe how I felt seeing my boys....when I say we have been through it all, I mean it....but thick and thin, beef or not I can count on them and they are my heart....but I still hadn't seen Eulus....  I get to the campus and we walk to the tailgate and then finally in a very anticlimatic fashion we just so happen to run into Eulus....at that point my homecoming came full circle....the cipher was complete....all that was left for me was to see my family....I don't think Tiffany could understand that....she kept talking about how she had a set agenda last weekend during Hampton's homecoming....her situation was different....for me, Morehouse is a true Homecoming....Atlanta is my home....I didn't come to party and drink....I wanted to see my friends and family....  I saw my little sister, Che, and she gave me my tent pass....I'm so proud of my sister, no matter where she is or what she does she is a natural....I saw her at that stadium and it was like she belonged there....it has always been like that for her....I see her and it's like she was always meant to be there....so she gives me my tent pass and I head over to the tent....  It never fails that I run into one of my mom or dad's old friends and they always comment about how much I've grown and they always express shock at whatever great endeavor I am involved in....I can only imagine what it will be like to see the little kids I know now go on to succeed....it must be a good, yet frightful feeling to them....  It was great seeing my Pops....I call Eulus my best friend and he truly is.....but my Dad is right up there with Eulus....it sufficed for me to just hug my Dad and listen to him talk for a second....he didn't say anything remarkable, just did how he always does.....but it was enough....that is what will get me through the rest of this school year....  I headed back over to the tent after that....and I was just in Euphoria....for once I wasn't concerned about anything at all....I just meandered from one point to the next....I didn't have one second of loneliness....I was in the right place at the right time for what seemed like only the third time in my life....(all three have happened this year....first was winning the national championship....and second was graduation weekend....I imagine the next time I feel that way will be when I get married or graduate from med school, whichever comes first....)  The time comes for me to head to the step show....my homie Randall looks out and finds tickets not just for me and Tiff, but also my lab partner, Jeralyn (did I misspell it?....and why is misspell such a hard word to spell?), and her best friend....things just pieced together for me like that....I go in and view the step show....it was like everything else this weekend....nothing special....yet the best ever....I can't explain it....I just sort of took it in and savored it....  Afterward I just headed away....I think this is when the agony started to set in (what is ecstacy without agony?)....as I headed into town with Tiffany I realized I didn't want to go to the party that night....I didn't want to hang with my boys....I wanted to see a female friend, but ole girl wasn't trying to hear it, she had to watch a movie with some friends or something....I took the hint....so I just wanted to head softly into the night....and I did....  I went to breakfast with my mother the next day....we had a good talk, as has become our custom....I try hard to be a good son because that is what every mother deserves, and I wasn't one for so long....I owe her a great debt....she has made great sacrifices for me and my sisters....I didn't see my little sister Nina and that tugs at my heart even as I type this....I have a hole in my trip and I don't think she understands that, but I do....one day she'll know how much I love her, yet how much of an effort it is to show her that love at times....  And I headed back to Nashville with Jeralyn....kind of symbolic of my new life....I have decided that she is my official connection between the old and new for various reasons I choose not to get into, but it was fitting that my weekend ended that way....  Anyway, it's back to the grind that is my Nashville life....and I'm out for now....

      Right....so I got robbed right?...and my landlord didn't want to change our locks right?....so I move into the big ass Meharry Towers right up the street from the school right?....so my life is peaches and cream now right?....  WRONG....  Because I spent the entire weekend moving, I had to neglect my studies....that equals another L taken on a Gross Anatomy Written test....mind you, I am in NO danger of failing the course....I locked up at least a C long ago...still this concerns me.....I need to do well on the subject board test at the end of the course to keep my dream of being a surgeon of some sort alive....  But how can a brother focus when his new, freshly renovated (meaning I am the first living being to sleep within these particular walls) apartment has no hot water?....I mean a brother thought his cold shower days were over when he left  urlLink Morehouse  ....  On a brighter note I drank some excellent Glenlivet and ordered Digital Cable earlier today....I am looking forward to getting the mother of all haircuts tomorrow cuz I look a hot ass mess right about now...  Gotta head back to the lab now....One!

      Faithful readers (hello OJ!)....sorry it's been so long....  My apartment finally has hot water....I think....I wouldn't know for certain because the dude came at 2:30 and I had a class at 3 and I got in the shower for a second and it was warm and then cold....now it could be that the water heater needed to warm up....I'm not certain....but I do know this....there will be one unhappy Killa Cal if this shit is lukewarm and not steaming, burning my superficial layer of cervical fascia when I hop in there in saaaaaaay 20 minutes....  In other news....I have officially hooked up my apartment.....got the sweet 5 disc DVD changer that plays MP3's and also the sony home entertainment system....found The Godfather Collection at CD Warehouse for $50....came very close to buying a digital camera....still might buy it....now if I could work on my interior decoration....  Ummmm this weekend was interesting....I had some people over Friday....you could call it a party as there was alot of liquor and I danced a little....but I had to kick these 3 chicks out....I got drunker and the rest of the night is a blur....Saturday my digital cable got turned on and I watched it all day....worked out a little....ate....Sunday my good friend and former roommate Crystal cooked for a few of us and my friend Tony came into town....I studied with my classmate Heather and called it a night....this is what goes down OFFICIALLY as an A plus weekend for Killa Cal....anytime I get a fresh, home-cooked meal and get to kick someone out of my new domicile in a three day period as well as watch over 200 channels of BS it is a good weekend....  Finally.... urlLink Morehouse ....Dear ole Morehouse....my alma mater....are the  urlLink SIAC  (wack ass page probably hasn't been updated!) champs in football and are going to the Pioneer Bowl....this is a great thing....Killa Cal will be there!....

      Okay...this has got to stop....Shanna and OJ, ya'll two need to handle ya'lls grievances the old fashion way and hit up that lil message board of long ago....here I am actually thinking other people read my nonsensical web page and have actually left me a comment and I find nothing more than an ongoing conversation between the two of you....I had been wrestling with the thought of addressing this for the longest and I finally realized that it was wearing thin on me....  In other news me and the homie Nile are headed out tonight....we should be in San Antonio by the time the Turkey is hot....keep me in your thoughts and prayers cuz strange things happen on the freeway....  I'm out!

      Well it's official....I am going to San Antonio to kick it with my long lost friend Brandon and his wife for Thanksgiving....  This is my favorite time of year besides the cold weather....I love reuniting with my friends and family and knowing that life can be simple....  I have some inner turmoil going on....I swear if I ever get married it will be through some minor miracle....I can think of the countless women I have had feelings for and never told them....the list is endless....I don't know whether I am scared of rejection, scared of how it might change the way things are, or just scared in general....I need a resolution....  I got a chance to catch up on the Real World this weekend....upon further review Coral is okay with me....Nicole is insecure....and Mike and Malik are just plain cool....everyone else is non-descript to me....oh yeah Lori still can't sing....  I think that is all for now....

      Questions of the day? (mostly derived shamelessly from the mind of OJ....but they got me thinking too so oh well)....  Why is that every effing hip hop/rap/psuedo r &b (more on that in a minute) song I find on my search engines of choice have those annoying mixtape DJ's yelling in them....I mean is there anything worse?....even the DJ's at the clubs don't yell in the middle of the song that much!  Why is the media leaving us hanging on this whole Chandra Levy and Gary Condit thing?....I mean they were bordering on overkill before September 11th, but you can't tell a nigro half the story and then just say eff it....I want to know now that you done started....where is that chick?!?!?!  Why might the Falcons make the playoffs this year?....Talk about unexpected pleasant surprises....  Okay onto psuedo R&B....I have decided that the last real R&B album ever released was Boyz 2 Men's Motownphilly...and even that is pushing it....actually I recind that last comment....the last real R&B album was N.E. Heartbreak or Guy's first album...whichever one came out first....this point is not up for argument....only silent observation and head nodding cuz I'm right....  anyways time to go to bed....I'm gonna try and actually go to lab tomorrow morning....  Outro....still enjoying the DSL (heh heh heh OJ)

      Boy oh boy....where to start?  Shouts out to the soldier of the year.....the homie Nile drove over 2000 miles this weekend....my boy is a true G for that....  Shouts out to Brandon's Aunt Jackie for cooking the fire, fire meal in New Orleans and helping make sure we got to San Antonio with a satisfied belly....  Boos and Hisses go to the traffic in New Orleans (who cares about the Bayou Classic)....and the traffic in Baton Rouge....and the walls in Dallas....and that sign that says 837 miles to El Paso....that's cold bisness....  Shouts out to the homie Brandon and his lovely wife Martha for opening their home to a nigro like me.....  Boos and Hisses to the club in San Antonio called the Atrium....too crowded....bad bartenders....too many rooms....just sucked!  Shouts out to Taco Cabana for having the bomb burritos and showing me how janky Taco Bell really is....  Shouts out to sleeping in till 1 on Thanksgiving....and eating lots of Turkey and watching lots of football and playing lots of playstation....and catching up on old times....  Shouts out to the mall in San Antonio with the Banana Republic and Watch Station and Bostonian that gladly accepted my SunTrust ATM....and the always dependable Best Buy....  Shouts out to Cavender's Boot Store for holding some boots I never came back to get....and even more shouts to the one who had the right size and in 30 seconds had me out of the store with my dad's Christmas present (at least half of it)....  Shouts out to Savage's....one of the top 5 clubs I have been in in the country (and I've been in some from Miami to D.C.)....extra special shouts to the cute girl who threw it on me during Break Yo Neck....truly lovely....  Shouts out to the Billiard's place where we threw back drinks....  Shouts out to Taco Cabana again....damn they are good....  Shouts out to Djarum for making bomb ass menthol cloves....and x-tra special 420 shouts to Brandon's nigga who gave us some of the best greenery this side of Seattle....man....I had a dream about that stuff....  Boos and hisses to Whataburger for not advertising your damn burger stands on the exit signs....a nigga had to settle for Jack in the Crack....  Boos and hisses to the entire state of Arkansas and their horrible traffic....  Shouts out to the lovely Crystal for bringing me my mail....  Shouts out to Tasha and Heather for caring whether I made it to and back from San An safely....  Shouts out to Nile's girls for coming through the spot....  and finally shouts to GOD for letting me live and do my thing....  I'm out....enjoying my new DSL!

      Shanna's worst fears are confirmed....some white boy has devised a test that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am officially the bougiest of nigros now....  Note to the white boy that created this:  learn how to spell newport.   I am 0-20% Ghetto    urlLink     I don't even know what ghetto is? Effing (editor's note....I try not to have the eff word on my page anymore) Preppy. I better hop in my beamer - head for the hood and get some chicken, watermelon, and neports.  Stolen yet again from  urlLink the gorgeous, always on point Dani ....sorry boo I couldn't help myself...  Addendum....Mark Paul Gosselar a.k.a.

      Well this is it for Lower Limb, Pelvis, and Perineum....it's all downhill from here....  On a completely different note, it's funny how I equate everything to lines from movies and songs....anyway here is another....I'm taking a note from vintage Ralph Tresvant...."I gotta do what I gotta do".....of course here is not the proper place "real" matters of the heart.....but I suppose it is therapeutic for me to state my intentions here first and then I can't back down from them at a later time....  I've started to read  Violets Are Blue  by James Patterson, a continuation of  Roses Are Red , the latest in the Alex Cross series....this is coinciding with a sort of artistic revival within me lately....I've been writing poetry lately....I have given additional thought to my screenplay with the homie Corey....and I even thought about starting my book....I'm well on my way to Harper Stewart-dom and multi-media mogul status....or maybe I'm regressing to sophomore year me....we'll see soon....

      Sarah McLaughlin is playing on the winamp...."I Will Remember You"....  And I just wrote two poems that won't be read by anyone without my DNA signature....  "Cheap Talk" by Loose Ends is playing now....which probably means I'll hold a meaningless conversation very soon....  The soundtrack to my life wouldn't sell very many albums and would probably be critically panned....

      Okay I am officially frustrated as hell....  All programs that keep comments are down it appears....this leaves me no choice....I must move this page to my own domain very soon and switch over to greymatter....for a lazy bum like me this is no good at all....  I had a nice long convo with  urlLink Kelly  yesterday....she is cooler than she knows....I need to meet a Kelly out here....(1)knowledge of self and (2)the ability to have opinions, hold them up against debate, and respect others opinions no matter how different they are from yours are probably two of the 10 most important things I think I'm looking for in the future Mrs. THE Killa Cal....  Oh yeah I have modified my nickname....I am now THE Killa Cal....like The Ohio State University....I don't know why?....I just am.....  Speaking of I Am....this man Nas has occupied alot of my hip hop discourse lately and I want to put it all on the table....I am a huge fan of Illmatic....if that red CD is in my sightlines 9 times out of 10 it will be placed in the nearest available cd player....I bought It Was Written on it's release date....it was okay to me but I was somewhat disappointed....as an avid sports fan I'm familiar with the typical sophomore slump so I chalked it up to that....the impending release of I Am also happened to coincide with my discovery of cuteFTP as a method of getting MP3's....needless to say I was one of those that participated in the massive downloading of pre-release tracks and (according to my theory) the subsequent altering forever of Nas's musical career and direction....the tracks from that pre-release version of I Am included Poppa Was A Player, Among Kings, Fetus Belly Button Windon, Blaze a 50, Drunk By Myself, Wanna Play Rough, Undying Love, along with a few of the cuts that saw the light of day (Dr. Knockboots, Nas is Like, and Hate Me Now among others).....the point is that if left unaltered I wouldn't even have to dispute whether Nas was a great rap artist as a whole....those songs are still available...download them and you will seee that if he had left it intact it would have been a five-mic album....instead he altered the album and released the decidedly mediocre version that is still is stores today....then he released Nastradamus which clearly he had put minimal effort into....and now it appears that Stillmatic may have some of these formerly unreleased tracks on it and may prove to be a good album....I admit that I am going to purchase it today (yes the real version....I have my ways!....envy me!)....but the fact remains that when the fans got anxious he got bluffed and went commercial....meanwhile look at how Jigga handled it....the first time (Vol. 3) he pushed it back a second but released his album unaltered....then the same thing happens to the Blueprint and he (and this is KEY) pushes the album UP....he never compromised the integrity of the album....now is Jigga a better lyricist than Nas?....no....is he a better marketer?....yes....Is he a better performer?....I don't know, I've never seen Nas perform....I know that I can depend on Jigga to come out with a banger every time out....can't say the same for the former Nasty Nas.....  I respect the Nas from Live at the Bar-B-Que....but Nas circa 2001 has alot to prove to me....this album needs to be free of the Bravehearts....free of mention of the Firm (another album I bought on the strength and was firmly disappointed with)....it needs to get back to what worked best for him....intricate lyrics and vivid images....get your pops, Olu Dara, on here to supply somemore background horns!  Anyway that's how I feel about it right now....any comments can be directed to me either via  urlLink AIM  or e-mail at Killacal13@aol.com since the comments are down....  I'll be back with a review of Stillmatic....and I'll end this whole debate once and for all....

      Okay....so a friend has e-mailed me to tell me she and her   husband   will be moving to Augusta soon....am I supposed to be overcome with joy about this?....I mean I was resting in the comfort that this chick who I have all of these unresolved feelings for was all the way in Alaska and now she is gonna be back in the lower 48 and wanting to keep in touch?....why me?  I was watching Family Ties....it really was a pretty decent show....there are no shows like that anymore....Bernie Mac is the only really good show out there....now if only he had a theme song sung by Deniece Williams and Johnny Mathis....

             If I were a work of art, I would be   Prehistoric Cave Art  .  I am primal and mysterious. Somewhat removed from modern life, I have a powerful ability to evoke wonder and show a sensitivity to nature as well as talents beyond what most people think of me.  Which work of art would  you  be?  urlLink The Art Test       As if the women in my life needed another reason to call me a neanderthal....this solidifies the point (if there was a point) made in my last post....

      The feeling of sitting at home and not doing shit cuz you don't have to do shit can never be overrated....  I am a lazy bum....I plead guilty as charged right here in this Ford Explorer chair....but dammit I'm a happy lazy bum....  I made a nice sausage pizza and made a huge mess I probably won't ever clean up and I'm content....  I am in full bachelor form....my house is a mess but the mess is such that a few tosses here, a little running water there, and a once over with the dust devil and I'm good to go in case of ummm...guests and such....  What a life!

      well....just got back from seeing Ocean's Eleven....  Great, great movie....I have been reading a few reviews from the usually reliable  urlLink Internet Movie Database  absolutely skewering the movie but I found it to be highly entertaining and a good diversion from the norm....It looked to me like the actors were enjoying themselves and therefore giving their best effort....oh well....I guess that's why I'm not a paid movie critic (yet)....  In other news I feel a little less embarrassed and whatever about earlier....I mean a scene was made and I felt a little isolated but it wasn't the horrible ordeal I made it out to be....I was with beautiful ladies after all....  Anyway I think I'm going to pull the all-nighter....on the agenda tonight....Godfather Part III, Halloween, and Reservoir Dogs....time to pop the popcorn....

      Woe is me....  Man I don't believe the stuff that happens to me sometimes....cuch good luck, yet unbelievably bad....  So I'm eating breakfast with six of my favorite ladies in the class and the homie Geoff....well Geoff leaves me alone with the ladies....and my immediate thought is, "Oh Joy!"....I should have been thinking, "Oh boy!"....Next thing I know three of them have gone to the car and they come back with gifts....yes I had the horror of being the lone male in a gushy female gift-exchange process....I thought I was going to die of embarrassment....it was AWFUL....  I'm still shaking off the effects as we speak....  The moral of this story is (in the continuing theme) NICE GUYS FINISH DEAD LAST (and endure undying humilation every step of the way)....

      Man oh man....  It's been a hell of a weekend fa sho....  I got slaughtered on my subject board but I guess we all take a beating sometime in life (Goodfellas indirect quote....the girls of 1208 know nothing about that....)  I have gone out in style each and everynight since....getting enough dank and drank to last me into the MMII (2002 for the slow heads....)  Got the sweet Jerry Rice (black) and Charles Woodson (Silver) jerseys....No OJ I'm not a Raider's convert though....  Anyway I had big plans for what was to be posted tonight and then I got some more alcohol in my system and this is the result...  See ya when I'm sober....

      Yet another of these tests that I find amusing....this time care of  urlLink Juwan  (good site dude....)     urlLink Which Evil Criminal are  You ?   "Congratulations, you're Imelda Marcos!  You're famous for your shoes (enough that you eventually opened an entire museum of them), and sometimes lauded as a celebrity. But underneath, you're still the woman who spent billions of dollars of money stolen from the Filipino population; theft that lead to extreme poverty.  Your husband, Ferdinand Marco, stole well over $5 billion, and plunged the entire country into heavier and heavier debt. Your response? Spend it. Spend it all.  Even when you claim to have reformed, sources estimate that you illegally hold $12 billion worth of shares. I guess luxury's just your style."  I guess this is what I get for making fun of all the shoes Crystal has....

      This was left anonymously in the guestbook of  urlLink  my old ass angelfire web page ....  "Hey dude, congratulations with school. Definitely something to be proud of. One suggestion with the page tho'.   Put somethin' other than black folks on it. Too much of any one color, no matter what color it is, is no good  . Peace."  What can this dude be thinking?.....Did I say that my webpage was the official race relations website of the USA?....I have pictures of me and my peoples....at the time I didn't have any white, asian, or hispanic peoples....boy oh boy....  Anyway if I want to surround myself with black people till the sun absorbs the Earth that is my choice....I have some white and asian friends, but that doesn't mean I have to post their pictures on my personal web space....  ughhh...anyway back to the mundane....

      Man oh man....  I just remembered why a brotha doesn't watch BET....  There was a video on as I was flipping past that abomination of a channel and I had to flip back to make sure my eyes had not deceived me....what I saw was worse than Mr. Dalvin's video....  The song was "What That Thang Smell Like" by Black Jesus....people I wish I was making this up....this is why we ain't going no where....Viacom's idea of "Black Entertainment Television" just keeps getting lower and lower....  I'm taking two shots of scotch and going to bed....maybe all of this will be a dream and I'll wake up tomorrow with Andrew Young as the president of the United States....

      I survived another week....  I want to talk about Halle Berry....I knew for awhile that she had some problems....I mean no man in his right mind would ever divorce her unless either a)he was really gay and married her for the front or b)she was crazy....while the jury is still out on Dave Justice, I know for certain now that Halle is crazy....  Witness her professing to anyone who would listen about how happy she was to marry Eric Benet and how he was the perfect man for her etc.....fast forward to now, she has exposed her ta-tas for some crazy amount of money and has now chosen to be filmed taking it from the back buck-nekkid by Billy Bob Thornton....now all of this woulda been cool with me and what not but I turned on the View the other day (I hear you laughing OJ....I was bored and didn't feel like going into the living room to watch a DVD) and she is promoting the film and saying how if her husband was doing the same thing she would DIVORCE HIM!....I was like "What the eff?"....anyway I say all that to say that Halle is officially crazy....and that my friends is why I don't trust any attractive, single woman over 30....  Anyway that's all....it's my opinion and I'm sticking to it....

Also I saw Faith Evan's new video this morning....she looks better than she ever did....I think I am even mildly attracted to her new look....this is disturbing to me....

      As Valentines Day approaches I figured I'd reprint my complaint about Valentines Day that I published last year at  urlLink ClubAUC.com  ....  Any comments can be sent my way at my aol address (killacal13@aol.com)....  Without further....  Okay, I promise this wont turn into too much of a confessional. I cannot have the entire AUC knowing all of my business. Its just that with this day approaching I have a lot of emotions ready to come out, and hey, writing is a great way to deal with it. Besides there are a lot of people out there that agree with me.   Its just that this day coming up, you know the day when you spread love and what not and shower that special someone with gifts and what not, well, it sucks! No really, its for the birds.   Now you are probably reading this and saying this guy has some unresolved issues, and you would be right. Let me try to bring you to speed.   At one point in my life, my cubbie hole was full of Valentines. Every girl in the class would send me one, sometimes it seemed as if they were competing to impress me the most. The rumor got out that I liked Root Beer Dum Dum pops and all of a sudden each note would have a sucker attached for this sucker here. Then, around the time when I got glasses and it was apparent I was going to be skinny and smart and not much else for a while, the cards stopped.   Ill spare you the gruesome details, but somewhere down the line I went astray. I perpetually have no woman at Valentines Day. Maybe I spend too much of my time chasing the wrong ones. Who knows? Bottom line is that I am unattached as are many, many, many other guys and girls out there.   Enough about me though, Im straying from the point. Why do I hate Valentines Day? Well, its simple. Its for men and women that have someone. Its the same reason I wouldnt like Christmas if I were Jewish. Who wants to see what seems to be the entire free world, getting lovey dovey, kissing and what not?   But just like Christmas, Valentines Day makes stores, from Parisian to Target, tons of cash. Like it or not Valentines Day is here to stay. Guys get tricked into spending tons of hard earned money yet another day out of the year, and for what? Okay dont answer that, it was a dumb question.   Then again, maybe Im being a hater (wont be the first time). Maybe one day I will spend the day with someone I care about and learn to see it as a great day. Maybe one day pigs will sprout wings and learn to fly away from the butchers. Until one of the two happens I will continue to hate this day when public displays of affection are allowed. I officially am the Grinch who stole Valentines Day. Lovebirds beware.

      I'm in class today right....so we start going over some mental disorders to look for in patients....I swear I had at least one of the symptoms of each one of the things we discussed....Passive aggresive, Obsessive Compulsive, Narcissism, Schizoid, paranoid, and histrionic....oh well at least I have a name for all of my various problems....  I've never bought anything for someone on a wishlist....but I swear the thought occured to me today as I was looking over one in particular....this can only be a bad thing....  Oh well time to watch "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"....How much for an order of ribs?....gotta love Chris Rock!!

      okay....okay....  first things first....I'm in Atlanta....don't care to discuss the reasoning in this forum....those who need to know why already do....  Okay so I go visit my dad today....he looks so much better and is alot more active....he is a little more emotional but to me that is a good sign because it tells me he is getting his wits about him....  In other news I checked out Monster's Ball....  Interesting flick....I'll do it actor by actor  Halle-Well I have already discussed my issues about her apparent lack of self-esteem/regard but she turned in a decent performance....her southern accent (as always) was a tough sell on a Gawhgah boy like me but I mean I have "lowered expectations from her and well....she exceeded them....  Billy Bob-Well I am not a big fan of his work so I have very little besides Primary Colors to use as a gauge....it was a solid performance....but allow me to digress and state that, by way of the fact that he is married to Angelina Jolie (one of the truly beautiful women in Hollywood (regardless of what box she checks for race) and that he was for all intents and purposes going "The Full Monty" with Halle, he is the MAN OF THE YEAR!  Sean Puffy Combs-Understand that I have a very love-hate relationship with this man's body of work....hellafied R&B producer.....horrible rapper....nice dancer....horrible rapper....nice clothing line (I'm wearing a t-shirt and jeans of his as I type this)....did I mention he is a GAH-BAGE rapper....and there is also the annoying fact that 25% of people I know say we look alike....but he put in the best performance....  I'm not here to spoil the movie.....so check it out yourself.....but I will say that out of all the phlegm that is out there you will feel somewhat satisfied with this movie....

      A Different World versus Saved By The Bell  At first glance these two shows have nothing in common....and at second glance....and again at third glance....  However they are two of my favorite TV shows of all time....they come on early in the morning on TBS....and they both have at least two distinctively different incarnations that make watching the show a little difficult at times.....  Right now ADW (Spelman has a man-bashing course called ADW but that is a rant for another day) is in the Denise Huxtable years....now as any child of the 80's knows, the Cosby Show was the only quality program on TV in the mid 80's and it just so happened that one of the older children would soon be about the age that she would be moving on to college....that can only mean one thing in the world of late 20th century television....SPIN OFF TIME....  Of course this led to many questions....could Denise (Lisa Bonet) carry a show all by herself with her "quirky antics"?.....the short answer is ultimately no....as the many guest appearances by Cosby cast members showed for whatever reason people just didn't care about Denise in this new environment....and as it turns out her getting with Lenny Kravitz may have been the best thing to happen to her because it gave her new life on The Cosby Show later on (I have no life at all....I know....I know)....It also merits mentioning that Debbie Allen came aboard as the producer the next season and things started to jell on the show....I say all that to say that in hindsight these Denise episodes suck (although they still had good ratings....what does the general public know anyway?).....  Great segue into a discussion on Saved by the Bell....because for all intents and purposes this show sucks....I mean the writing was bad....the plots made little to no sense....6 kids and a principal controlled everything that went on at Bayside High and this is before we even bring up the Middle School (Miss Bliss), Tori (When Kelly and Jessie mysteriously fell off the face of the Earth), and God-awful College Years....yet for some reason I feel compelled to watch and enjoy every episode....I really care about the zany antics of Screech and Lisa and Zach and Kelly....the enjoyment of SBTB knows no bounds of race or creed....it is the one thing that all people from my generation can agree on....this show where nothing had to make sense from episode to episode was beloved by everyone....hey! our favorite kids from SBTB have gone on to even do other things (I didn't say they did good other things....)  Here is a many where are they now (or where were they a few years ago other than SBTB related stuff....)  Zach is currently on NYPD Blue....he made some really bad movies that noone saw because he couldn't make any movies about him getting bucknaked and not get branded a porno star.....he also performs stunts in his free time in off road bike races....  Slater was (or maybe still is) on Pacific Blue (another one of those "only TV can think of a premise this stupid" show about cops who can only ride bikes)....he also hosts what some TV exec wants you to believe is a male version of the View, "The Other Half (or something)" with Danny Bonaduce and Dick Clark (I wish I was making this up....)  Screech can't excape the shadow that is SBTB....he was/is on the most recent incarnation of SBTB (what's the deal with that?....I mean when will producers learn that digging up the corpse of Jackie Gleason and televising an autopsy won't make that "The Honeymooners 2002")....yep...he has been typecast....  Kelly played Valerie Malone on Beverly Hills 90210 for a while....she was your standard "young hussy trying to find herself but content to wreck the lives of all of her associates" which isn't bad when you consider....  ....Jessie went on to become the biggest star of them all....playing naked slut-bucket Nomi Malone in Showgirls....now I have seen Showgirls a couple of times (as has been previously stated I have no life....)....when I say this movie has the worst script ever I am including Surf Nazis Must Die in my evaluation....incidentally how ironic is it that both Kelly Kapowski and Jessie Spano went on to play sluts with the last name of Malone....(oh yeah I refuse to call any of them by their real names except Lark Voorhies...no real reason except to be a jackass)....oh yeah she also played a prostitute in the most recent reason for Al Pacino to yell alot, "Any Given Sunday"....  Finally Lark Voorhies who played Lisa (the character who made the least sense in a show that made no sense)....she looked as if she was going to become a legit second tier celebrity after her stirring role in "How To Be A Player" as Bill Bellamy's girlfriend....but alas, as is the fate of many promising Black actors and actresses she has been doomed to a fate of appearing in mindless BET arabesque movies....yep....she is officially a third tier celeb  Until later on....

      Okay....I feel somewhat better....my interview went pretty well....  Now to my original intent....  Five movies and five songs de jour (in no particular order)....  1)Rushmore - This movie is one part Killa Cal....one part Joey C (a good friend and big brother I never had)....we are Max Fischer....tons of great lines....just a damn good movie....  2)The Big Lebowski - This movie is a staple in my movie diet....John Goodman is at his best here in the part he was born for....Jeff Bridges is the dude!....and the dude abides.....  3)Higher Learning - No movie has the power to make me as angry as this movie....listening to John Singleton's commentary really enhanced an already great movie....  4)The Best Man -THE movie for my generation of young, upwardly mobile Black males....now if I could just innact my plan to steal Sanaa Lathan from Omar Epps....  5)Goodfellas - The story of Henry Hill will always be my favorite....hands down, bar none....  and on to the songs.....  1)Moby featuring Gwen Stefani - Southside (remix)....I like Gwen a whole lot....I discovered No Doubt a little late....  2)Shai - The Place Where You Belong....seriously slept on R&B song from an underappreciated group....  3)Musiq Soulchild - Settle For My Love....I had no idea that this was a remake of a Patrice Rushen song until a few weeks ago....he really did well by it....  4)Destiny's Child - Dangerously in Love....See the thing is....these girls have never amde a good song....they have made some catchy tunes....but good music?....not before this one!  5)Radiohead - Creep....Sums up so much of how I feel most of the time....maybe I'm really a melancholy white boy stuck in the body of an out of shape 22 year old black kid....  Anyway all of this is subject to change....but it's how I feel right now....  Holla!

      Another day....  With all that's been going on in my life I'm starting to get more and more discouraged about where exactly my life is headed....I mean not as far as my career path is concerned, I enjoy med school so far and I know I'm going to be a good doctor....no, I'm more concerned about my personality and how adversity is changing it....I used to be a super duper optimist despite my outward statements....I might play the role of a malcontent but in actuality I enjoyed my life and I felt like everything was rosey....I truly felt that each day was better than the next....  now, try as I might I just don't feel that way anymore....I wake up hoping that today I will recieve more good news than bad....today I have to perform a videotaped interview of my partner in Physical Diagnosis....I am looking forward to it....but at the same time my thoughts linger into the murky, uncertainess of my future....it's not just my dad's situation....it's a combination of alot of things....I have alot of unfinished business and with my increasing awareness of my own mortality I wonder if I will ever get to square away my feelings with the people I love before "my time" comes....hell I don't know....  It's funny cuz I had all intentions when I first signed on to blogger to list my top five movies and songs of the moment and be done with it....I have thrown myself head first into a world of music and movies....escapism at it's finest....but I know that I need to "face the music" (see where my mind is?) about my own personal problems....  I'm trying to make it....I don't know what it will take at this point....I'm lost.....

      Okay....random thoughts about items on my winamp playlist time....  I never get tired of Celebrity Jeopardy on SNL....I have all of the skits on my winamp playlist and I always laugh at them....it never fails....  Mike Tyson is also a reliable source of humor...."my style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable, I want to eat his children, praise be to Allah", you couldn't assemble a team of Hollywood writers anywhere to come up with something so ridiculously funny....  So I am sitting minding my own business when "I Really Like It" by Harlem World comes on....it was one of those moments where I questioned my own sanity....why did I download that song??....then Baby Stase's verse comes on and I'm redeemed....  I strongly considered deleting all of my R. Kelly songs after hearing about what he allegedly (and I only use that word because he hasn't been convicted yet) did to those poor little girls....R. Kelly is worse than Osama Bin Laden....I will not argue this point....  Anyway that's enough for now....

      In this addition of the ravings of a man slowly going mad I will discuss.....my top five songs of the moment and my current state of being....  What I'm feeling right now musically is (once again in no particular order):  1)U2-Beautiful Day....just a good song in general....U2 is a hella good group....  2)Deon Estus & George Michael-Heaven Help Me.....another one of those songs I love because I can relate to it....  3)Lil Will feat. Cool Breeze-Lookin For Nikki.....This is an ATL classic....if you ain't from the A-Town you wouldn't understand.....  4)Destiny's Child-Dangerously In Love.....Yep I still like it....it will soon approach Faith "Soon As I Get Home" and Guy "Lets Chill" status....  5)Stevie Wonder-Rocket Love.....not so much about love anymore to me....it's life.....  Now about my life....I just don't know....I try to do the best I can to shake these blues and I just can't.....I have given serious thought to seeing a shrink because I know that I have all of the symptoms of clinical depression....when I think about it I have been depressed long before my dad got sick but I was able to hide it a little better....I think my Aunt Lynn's funeral was a real big breaking point for me....I lost it about three distinct times....I just don't know what the deal is....I've been escaping to Black Planet alot lately....hiding my pain behind my chat ID....I haven't been studying and I don't really want to....this has been a problem for 2 months now....something has got to give....

      This one is gonna be quick....the Jackson's An American Dream is on!!!  Anyways, I am treading in dangerous waters....I have been spending alot of time in the vast wasteland that is BlackPlanet....and get this...there was actually an intelligent conversation today....I couldn't believe it....  Oh and I happened to run into this girl who I took a class at Spelman with in the chat room....I remember thinking she was really cute.....but she was also really smart and well....to put it nicely I tricked off that class....I was surprised she remembered me before I put it together who she was....hmmm.....hopefully it wasn't an isolated incident....  Anyways back to the greatest Mini-series ever....

      An unbelievable amount of my youth was spent watching cartoons....From Woody Woodpecker and Chilly Willy to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck....the Bionic Six, Transformers, Voltron, Thundercats, Bravestar, the Smurfs, and even the USA Cartoon Express....  But besides Hanna-Barbera I never gave much notice to the people behind the scenes....I mean my dad gave me an appreciation for the late great Mel Blanc, who provided the voices for so many of the characters from Bugs to Tom the Cat, but I besides the voices (and I got good at telling a voice.....), I never really gave the artists their due....  Then I started to read comics and my appreciation for the artists started to come into play....I soon began to pay attention to the names that would show up at the beginning of cartoons and to my astonishment all of my favorite Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry episodes without fail were all directed by a guy named Chuck Jones....  Chuck Jones died this weekend....this is the man that gave us among others Wile Coyote and the Road Runner, PePe Le Pew, and Marvin the Martian....his characters had a distinctive look about them and you could always tell a Chuck Jones cartoon not only because of the way the characters looked, but the subtle humor....in his episodes of Tom and Jerry it was more than mad-cap hijinx....  Well at any rate I wanted to take a moment and give tribute to this man who at the very least kept a little kid with too much going on in his head entertained....there won't be another person like him....

      Last night I went laser tagging....  The homie Geoff had been playing Grand Theft Auto 3 the day before and he was working on his sniping technique....well he put it to good use last night....he finished in 2nd place (out of 32) all from sniping people in one spot....I finished in 4th place for the second time in a row.....we also had nine other classmates (all female) show up as victims in our massacre....  Then we headed to a kegger thrown by our classmate Sean....cool guy that Sean!  I found the criterion collection of Do The Right Thing at Suncoast yesterday!.....and Hollywood Shuffle.....and I also came up on some sweet LaCoste shirts for $15 each....  My sisters are coming up tonight!....I can't wait it's gonna be a great week!!!!

      My mind has been altered permanantly.....  Why you ask?  Did I sit in on a Tony Robbins lecture?  Did I meet my hero Dr. Ben Carson?  Did I see a psychoanalyst?  The answer to all three of these questions is no of course.  And NO I haven't started effing with shrooms....I don't even eat them on my food.  No, I have been affected profoundly by the game GRAND THEFT AUTO 3.  Yes, this game is the greatest game ever.  It has combined all of my secret fantasies of death, destruction, and gratuitous violence.  I can drive as recklessly as I want with little consequence.  I can beat cops like stuck pigs!  Am I sick?  Quite possibly!  Is GTA3 the best game ever?  Of course!

      Well....my relapse into the world of Blackplanet is over and done with....  I, Killa Cal, who had previously made bold statements such as, "I'll never let one of these internet people get to me" and blahzay blue have let a simple minded BP chat female get me shook up to a minor degree....mind you it was nothing of any serious magnitude....but enough to wake me up and help me realize that I'm in medical school for Pete's sake....I shouldn't be in there anyway!!!  So thank you Redbonechick72 for showing me the err of my ways....  I'll miss Miss ToyaJ and Bean and Asher and Sweetness and other people with strange chat names but hey....I really met some interesting characters in Blackplanet....but I needed to call it quits so I feel safe in saying.....  To Hell with Black Planet!!!....

      Black Planet Ettiquette  Let me preface this rant by saying that I know the chances of improving the behavior of idiots who happen to find a computer and get to BlackPlanet (the odds of this happening are better than you would think.....trust me....I blame Best Buy) are slim to none....but I need to vent before I explode....  Actually this was psuedo-inspired by Kelly Kel's a/s/l complaint which leads to my first point of order....  1)Don't ever, ever direct an a/s/l request at me!.....Usually I will respond with the following "witty retort":  22/yes please/Nashville....but from now on I am going to be HOSTILE!  2)Don't flood the screen with your sorry self advertisements....it is sad enough that you are even chatting in blackplanet....don't do the complete dignity suicide thing by constantly plugging your shitty page with one picture and begging for hits and notes so that you can get a lousy BlackPlanet t-shirt or coffee mug....if you join a college newspaper you can get that crap for free!  3)About these shitty webpages....this might be my biggest complaint!  Please, please, please don't put any music on your page!!....If you must put music on your page make it an option for the visitor to turn the crap off!  Nine times out of ten I have music already playing and your annoying music is not what I want to be listening to.  I personally hold "webmistris" responsible for this....90% of the village idiots on BlackPlanet have the latest Alicia Keys/Keke Wyatt/Faith Evans song courtesy of this idiot savant....if you are going to provide code for people don't half ass it!  4)If I flirt with your "online girlfriend" don't get irate with me.....see, I'm not going to fly all the way to East Buttfuck, California and try to steal your little girlfriend who is probably 300 pounds and lives in the basement of Granny's house.....I'm just having a little fun (more than likely at her or your expense)....I'm not trying to break up any happy cyber homes....

      The whole world has changed.....  Well maybe not the whole world....but damn near close to it....  I am a full blown BlackPlanet addict....I have to have a BP fix and I couldn't think of a jankier webgroup to be addicted to....it is literally like being a crack addict....there are better forums with a more desirable group of users but once you are hooked you are hooked....it's not even as glamorous as herion....the problems with BP are too numerous to even think about addressing....yet I spend an inordanate amount of time there.....  Kel is the only source of consistancy out there....Daana's gone....Dani's still hanging around....OJ's posting as often as me....  Yep....all I read now is Kelly and the Sports Guy on ESPN.....my world view has once again narrowed....  My dad is walking and talking....  In the last two weeks I have traveled back and forth between Nashville and Atlanta too many times....by bus, by plane, by car.....one of these days I'm going to walk.....  I am now obsessed with being with an older woman (26-35)....no particular reason....I guess I was slightly influenced by this BP acquaintance (nothing good can come out of BlackPlanet....nothing.....)  I went to Chaos in Buckhead last night....interesting club....I waited for about 10 minutes to get up to an area called the "Skybar"....and what I found up there was the typical crowded club experience....you can barely move....don't think about seeing what is in front of/behind/next to/below you....only the person in front of you matters and you are only pleased if it is a phat-assed female....  I here rumors that Rapheal Saadiq and D'Angelo have done what R. Kelly and Jay Z wished they could....made a decent collabo....I'll see soon....Glenn Lewis is what I've been listening to lately outside of my usual downloads (i.e. I actually bought the CD.....eat that industry pundits)....  Got a subscription to Maxim and Entertainment Weekly....I am officially a grown up....  More nonsensical thoughts can be expected when I get back from the SNMA conference in Houston....later

      It is worth mentioning....  It is again time for the  urlLink Honda Campus All Star Competition  in Orlando, FL(by the way on the page they are promoting the Honda magazine ad that has me featured prominantly in case you haven't seen it)....in case you just happened to fall here (how does that happen) and didn't know I was on the National Champion Morehouse team last year....I wear the ring for it proudly, as not many people have a national championship in anything to their name....  Anyway, according to the latest scoreboards we are again running amuck....last year we broke all sorts of records scoring over 4000 points in the round robin portion....They aren't on that kind of pace this time it appears....but still a repeat seems immenent....  This reminds me of one of the finest moments in my young life so far....this time last year we were enthralled in the toughest game our team had faced.....we were down against Jackson State in the round of eight....our usually reliable leading scorer was struggling that round and he was feeling down and out....my role with the team up to that point was a mix of odd trivia master/wiley veteran....I was not the most prolific scorer but I was consistant and I didn't miss many questions (missing takes away points)....at any rate we were down to the last few seconds and long story short I answered the winning question (the answer was Portugal....I'll never forget it)....yep....I was the John Paxson or Francisco Cabrera for that day....I might never have another moment where I shine like that again....but I will always remember it....everytime I look at my championship ring.....  I hope John, Jay, Jared, Rubani, and this year's freshman get to do it again!!....Go Morehouse!

      Okay....  This thing about my quest lately to smell very good, I really can't explain....I guess it can all be traced back to the first time my lil sister Nina took me to Sephora....I swear in all my visits to Lenox I never paid much attention to the store....I thought it was a makeup store or something (I was partially correct)....I had no idea of the wealth of "smell goods" out there for guys....so I decided to give it a shot....I spent about an hour in there testing smells....and I was hooked....  The first fragrance I ever wore regularly was Cool Water....Like many a weak mind I was influenced by music, I heard Snoop Dogg talk about it....I said hey let's try it....I think Curve was in style at the time....I didn't care though....I liked Cool Water....I eventually ran out of that smell and I was given Polo Sport as a gift....along with an imposter Tommy (never took more than three sprays of it and I can't even tell you where it is now)....  I quickily got a bottle of Hugo Boss and that immediately jumped to number 1....it had a nice sweet smell to it that I really liked on me....and the ladies liked it too....then this Christmas Nina gave me a bottle of Issey Miyake....I learned an important lesson from that....always let a lady pick your cologne....ALWAYS.....I swear I got more compliments from the smell of Issey than I have ever gotten before....I was hooked.....at about this time I also got into the Bath & Body works shower gels....I have always been partial to the smell of vanilla so I bought two bottles of that, a bottle of coconut, and a bottle of cucumber melon....  Recently I have purchased Carolina Herrara 212 (a good counter balance to the Issey, also suggested by Nina) and a shower gel/cologne set from the LaCoste boutique....it has a fresh smell for spring....I figure I'll use that in opposition to the Polo Sport....I also like the fact that I can be virtually assured that no one else in the Nashville area has this fragrance....nothing like the feeling of smelling UNIQUELY good....  Coming soon....another recent obsession....good ties and their importance....

      A day later and no embarrassing e-mails or phone calls??....maybe I should post about more of my crushes....on second thought...naaaaaaaaah....  I neglected to make note earlier but it IS worth noting that two of my closest friends at Morehouse have each won the two most powerful positions in the SGA....congrats go out to Randall Woodfin the SGA President-elect and L. Jared "Squire" Boyd the SGA Vice President-elect.....SVR boys!!  In other news....I have an OSCE today....I am a sorry dude because I forgot what that stands for but I CAN tell you that it is a skills assessment that is a component of my Physical Diagnosis class....to further elaborate I must go from room to room and perform a section for 15 minutes of a sample patient interview as directed by a proctor....  Got tests next week, and for the first time in a while I feel halfway prepared for them....I plan to really study hard this weekend so that I can make up some ground for the tests that I flubbed earlier this semester....  I have kept this area sports free for a long while, so I am waaaay overdue for my commentary....  Baseball season has started and I'm a happy camper....the Braves have scored 20 runs in three games....Barry Bonds has 4 home runs in 3 games...if things keep up at this pace it will be a great season!!.....In basketball things are pretty much unfolding how I expected them to....people should keep a close eye on this Shaq situation....if he is hurt, watch out!!.....the Kings, Mavs, or even (ugh) Spurs could all sneak into the Finals and make noise....I wouldn't want to play any of those three....  The NCAA Final Four was really cool for me....my little sister was able to attend Saturday's games....we both had a particularly keen interest in the games because her friend AJ Moye played a key role in Indiana's success....next year our neighbor "Lil Earl" (he's not so little anymore) will be playing Division 1 ball at some major school (the school he mentioned to me as being in the lead is a preseason top 10)....as if I needed another reason to follow college basketball closely, now I have even more interest....  I don't know if I mentioned it before or not but my high school alma mater won the Georgia 4-A Championship this season losing only one game in the process....the aforementioned "Lil Earl" was on that squad...congrats to them!  Anyway time to wash off and smell good!!....sometime later I will talk about my new found obsession with body washes and colognes....but not now!!!  Peace

      Okay....  I had told myself I wasn't going to do this....but I am....  I was having a convo with my friend Coco (I love you buddy!!!) and she was telling me how she talked to my first crush....and she asked about me....  So here goes....a list of my 4 most significant crushes....I am pretty sure they didn't know or if they did played it really cool....the time range is 5th grade to senior year of high school....I hope they don't happen to run into this...I would be very embarrassed...but oh well...here goes nothing  Kelly S. - Man....I don't even know what it was about her in hindsight...but I had the biggest thing for her for most of my middle/high school years....we were only in class together for one year but I would run into her at various functions or at the mall and since Coco was her good friend I would keep up with what she was up to through her....well, according to Coco she has two kids now....the trippy part about it is that I know the dude who is the father, we went to middle school together....she's marrying him on Jan. 1st....I'll be there....I jokingly told Coco I would do a Dwayne Wayne....I wouldn't do something so silly....I'm happy for her....  Staci - I will never forget the first time I met her....first day of school sixth grade....she was the cutest girl I had ever seen....well we ended up being in the same class all the way through high school and she always had this Halle Berry thing going on....she was hands down the cutest girl in our class/school....she didn't like me at all when we met (I was very obnoxious....hard to believe eh?....heh heh heh)....but we ended up becoming good friends....saw her at a christmas party this past holiday season....I kinda sorta made an effort to tell her how I used to feel and then at the last minute I just sorta insinuated at it....  Inda - *sigh*I was going through my Tatyana Ali phase....I knew her most of my life but I didn't develop a crush on her until around Sophomore year of high school....she lived right up the street from me....matter of fact I caught the bus about two houses away from her....anyway for some reason she reminded me of Tatyana Ali....she was a year younger than me but she was really nice....I made   very weak   attempts to holla at her and she pretty much let me now it wasn't happening....she's doing big things where she is....so I hear....  Leslie - Okay in this case we barely knew each other....usually I can at least become friendly with a chick I find attractive....but whenever I saw this girl I would freeze up and I couldn't say a word....she was in my summer program at Xavier University of Louisiana....she was from Cali....she forever altered my perception of Cali girls....for awhile I really did wish they could all be California girls....my roommate during the program, Marcus, made a half-assed attempt to tell her that I liked her and I got sooooo mad with him....I don't know what I was scared of....I wonder what she is up to now?  So there it is....I finally got my feelings out in the open about four of the women who have caused the most inner turmoil for me....  It's funny because the whole nature of this blogging process is highly personal yet this is the first entry which really feels PERSONAL to me....like I am giving you (whoever you are) a glimpse into who I am at the very core....I'm a hopeless romantic....a big scary kid....but I feel a little better...

      This is my last attempt to post something before I go full swing with moving to Killacal.net (the time is coming people....I tell you!!!)  I made three attempts to post a tribute to my strong as hell, great role model of a black man, Dad....yesterday was his 52nd birthday and he worked harder to get to this one than he ever has....I am so proud of my dad I don't think I can adequately express it....if I can grow to be half the man he is I will be okay....  In the meanwhile I am also very proud of my friend  urlLink Beth ....I already knew how intelligent she is (I have the honor of talking to her pretty much daily)....but still she never ceases to amaze me.....check her out....I see big things happening in her future!  Here goes nothing....if this doesn't save....adios Blogger

           urlLink Which "Saved By The Bell" Character Are You?      Not to mention I knew which answeres to get so that I could be classified as the coolest white person on TV ever.  So I just got back from the SNMA convention in Houston, TX.  Soooo much went on.  Firstly I didn't do any of the things I was supposed to do.  Go to meetings??....Blah?....How can you go to meetings when there is a Brooks Brothers right downstairs?.....However I did have too much fun....more fun than the law allows (literally).  First day....man oh man....get to the airport at around 7:15 and wait till 8 for the bar to open....me and Geoff each had 4 drinks (mine was scotch and tonic) and we were also joined by our classmate Amanda....we arrive around 11 in the morning and me, Geoff, and Dave ride out with their linebrother Dave....(yeah two Daves)....we roll out to the university of Houston.....this school was something completely different to me....from my very limited view it seemed kinda cool but it was very, very different.....then we decide to take it to the other TSU (which by the way will never be refered to as TSU by me from this point forward....)....Texas Southern is the perfect school for you if you always wanted to be greek but aren't so sure about the Divine Nine....it seems that the black folks at THIS school have taken every conceivable three letter combination of Greek letters and formed a group....are you dark skin with nappy hair and face only a mother could love but you still want to twirl a cane???....join ramdom organization A!!!....yes at Texas Southern noone is a nobody!!....Then we make our way to a place that served Empanada's (also known as Oompaloompas....).....these balls of fried tortillas with chicken inside were the greatest.....Michelina's needs to begin work post stat on creating a microwave version for my enjoyment....  So we get to the hotel....the Westin Galleria....at this point I would like to congratulate the genius who decided to connect a hotel with a mall....what a great effing idea!!!....I then proceded to go wild inside of what is probably the most ballingest mall I have ever entered....Lenox and Phipps have nothing on the Galleria....oh and I did see Kelly from Destiny's Child in Gucci not to mention....that and I discovered that there is a LaCoste boutique!!....went to a meeting led by some chick who probably should have been a kindergarten teacher but somehow found her way into someone's med school....at this point I am tired and head into the mall again (this happened about 90 times during the next three days)....then we got ready for the night's festivities...  The Hard Rock Cafe was the spot for the night....prior to leaving however, it is the custom to get "liquored up".....because we were in Houston we decided to go all out!....the Super Magnum of Grey Goose and two huge bottles of Apple Puckers were purchased....drinks were tossed up all around (not to mention there was weed)....by the way.....our room consisted of me, Geoff, Dave, and Mark (this is key later on)....so after a suffiecient period of drinking and smoking we head out to the Hard Rock....I had a blast....I saw one person I was expecting to see (Renita) and one I didn't expect to see (Charmaine) and I was pleased on both counts....after hanging for a while we decided it was time to leave....but we couldn't find Mark....and well since me and the other three were all in some various form of intoxication Mark didn't make it into the car with us (which in hindsight was probably a good thing)....so off we head to Taco Cabana cuz aggin's are hungry....but Houston Dave kept giving Meharry Dave bad directions such as:  "Whenever I tell you to turn make a left" (while pointing right) and while on the freeway (yeah you can get off at anyone of these exits)....anyway we somehow ended up in a Denny's parking lot where Houston Dave says, "My house is around the corner.....I'm finna piss the dog and I'll be right back"....yes that's right this man did say he had to "Piss the Dog"....now if any of us had been sober we wouldn't have gotten out of the car.....we would have in fact headed to the hotel....but we were not....and as a result we were "out there bad"....we ended up taking a cab back from Denny's after finding out were probably in the neighborhood Jason's Lyric was filmed in....not good times....bad times....we make it back to the room expecting to not see Mark...not only do we see this fool....we see him posted up on the floor in the bathroom with one hand on the rim of the toilet looking up with a blank look....and despite the fact that we all needed to urinate "The Dude" would not leave his post....Geoff laughs for an hour and we all head to sleep....  Day two....we wake up the next morning and the Dude has changed positions....he is now sleeping with his upper torso in the closet and his lower body in the hallway....we all had to step over, around, and even on him to iron our clothes and anter the bathroom....we get dressed and decide to call "Piss the Dog" and see what the hell happened last night....dude didn't remember having left us at all....he said he woke up and his front door was open and he was basically out there bad just like us....we had a few good laughs about this and then I decided to go pay my friend Renita a visit....we caught up for a long time and even went into the mall (I got a LaCoste Cologne and got on the mailing list along with a cd or two)....went to a meeting and discovered how obsolete I really was.....turns out that our region feels like our school has too much voting power even though we have over half of the membership in the region and control 85% of the funds.....long story short they gave our school only one vote and left the other delegates high and dry.....at this point most of us said eff the conference and it became about having as much fun as possible....  We then head to a party at a place called "The Mansion"...."Piss the Dog" had never heard of the Mansion so we were apprehensive at first....turns out that this place might have been the best club I've ever had the pleasure of entering....it was laid out like a Mexican Hacienda with various outdoor patios and plush upstairs areas with couches....it had beds in the main room and it was just the greatest....it combined the best parts of 112, Vegas Nights, and Karma all in one club with the atmosphere of the Industry and crowds as good as the old Phenomena(if you aren't familiar with Atlanta clubs none of this will mean anything to you)....in short this was the best party ever....beating out the imfamous 2000 Senior Party at the Chili Pepper....yes it was that great....we headed to Taco Cabana and then called it a night....  The next day my boy Bernard was having a barbeque so initially the whole crew was supposed to roll out that way....Dave still had alot more weed so he wanted to make some brownies and we also still had some shopping we wanted to do....I went and got some Air Huaraches (Dark grey/light grey)....then Amanda made her way up from Louisiana with her cousin and best friend....we end up heading out to this mexican restuarant which was nowhere near as good as the first one we visited and then I headed back to the hotel so that Eulus could come get me and whoever to go to Bernard's....Whoever ended up going from about 4 people to just me and Heather....Bernard had just pledged Omega so he had some of his LB's over....they were cool but after a while I was ready to go.....2 hours after a while had passed I was finally able to leave and we headed back to the Hotel....I didn't really want to do anything at all when I got back to the hotel....Heather and I had gotten a half gallon of Absolute and it would have been fine by me to have a little room party and call it a night....I happened to run into Charmaine again and I REALLY wanted to kick it with her because I hadn't gotten a chance to even so much as dance with her and she was looking GOOD....but at any rate I headed out with the fellas and we ended up going to a place called Semper's which I didn't remember very well because of the brownies.....  Which leads to today....somehow I packed all of my stuff and didn't leave anything in Houston....I saw Charmaine again this morning at the airport but I was just too tired/high/plain ole out of it to even go sit with her....luckily for me I was able to get her number so I plan to call her for certain....the flight was okay (kinda bumpy) and I've been asleep ever since....  I am glad I have tomorrow off because I will need it....what a weekend!!

      More people watch BET uncut than I realized....  So I was checking my site meter stats and what not and a surpising number of people (okay like 3 or 4) got to my site buy searching for "What That Thang Smell Like" by Black Jesus.....sheeze...I talked about that horrible video one time!!!....oh well...whatever gets hits I guess....  not much to say today except I should be studying.....so guess what I'm finna do?

      The Honda team has "hit the big time".....they haven't seen this much publicity since the BET days....anyway thanks to Beth for finding  urlLink this link ...  Got another issue of Entertainment Weekly as well as the latest Maroon Tiger (the newspaper I worked on for two years at Morehouse)....I must say I was kind of taken aback and a little ashamed that one of the articles in the paper was taken directly (word for freaking word) from an e-mail I got....the second annual Profeteezy awards....as I was reading it I was like, "Hey this is familiar"....the current EIC is on my buddy list and happened to be online as I was reading it....just when I was about to send him a message he signed off...come on Geoff!!!....I know ya'll are better than that....we can be original and FUNNIER than some mass produced e-mail that I got twice!!!....don't let me down like that again!

      I overslept and missed class....so what is the first thing I do?....go to Blackplanet!!  There is a problem here people....I recognized it though....I'll fix it....give me time....I'm not a bad guy, just lazy....  Anyways I know I said in an earlier post I was going to talk about my new love of ties....well I changed my mind....just don't feel like it anymore....  Let's talk about this whole daylight savings time concept....this is really screwing up my internal clock....instead of merely losing an hour I am sleeping like crazy....I actually woke up around five am and then went back to sleep and COULD not wake up....I hit my alarm clock violently when it went off at 7:09 or whenever and proceded to sleep until 11:15 or so....I gotta get it together though cuz tests are coming....  Another good episode of the Cosby Show came on Nick at Nite last night....this time Cliff's father and his two friends (one being the dude from Herman's Head....remember that show???) came over to play Pinochle....TREEEE-mendous comedy....the subplot involving Vanessa's date was classic....the lil dude was funny, although watching it now he seems a little....umm...non-heterosexual...."Is that all Dahsta Hustable???".....hilarious!!  Anyway....I gots to do better...no more missing class for any reason!

      A few things....  Firstly....I turned to Tech TV as I sometimes do in my TV viewing and I saw a little segment telling people about Blogger and how to blog....the chick on there seemed to be on the far left end of the bell curve in terms of intelliegence as she kept clicking the post button instead of post and publish and then getting mad because it wouldn't show up on her page....I found the whole thing to be kind of funny....  Also I saw a couple of my favorite episodes of two of my favorite sitcoms ever....the Cosby Show was an episode featuring the Grandparent's 50th anniversary (the second one...not the one with the Ray Charles song, but the one with the James Brown song)....what I liked about this episode was not just the whole song and dance routine (which, it should be noted, was VERY good)....I liked Elvin's interaction with Cliff and Claire in this episode more than anything....Cliff teaches him this whole "hands off" technique for dealing with Huxtable women which was just hilarious....and then this jackass goes into the kitchen to open a jar of pickles (A man's job he says) and immediately has to employ it....it's pretty funny....then I wake up this morning and the Fresh Prince is on....lo and behold it's the BBD episode....also featuring Geoffrey getting to play the big shot role and messing up Phil and Vivian's getaway weekend....it's the little things (as Joe would say).....  On another note....I feel very badly for attempting to trick a friend of mine with this e-mail that tries to pry deep dark secrets from them....my boy Nile tricked me with it and for a split second I thought it might be funny...but in hindsight I kind of violated her trust and I feel bad about it....what's worse is that I sent it to two other people....luckily said friend is much smarter than me and was not fooled....she says it wasn't a big deal....I still feel bad....sorry!!!  On the menu today....Killa Cal makes Nachos!!!....it's gonna be hell to clean up....but heavenly on my stomach!!

      Success finally.....  I got a 100% on my vital signs skills....the test consisted of Blood Pressure, Pulse Obliteration point, radial pulse, brachial pulse, temperature, and respiration rate....I know you might be sitting here reading this like "big effing deal"....well it is....we used one of those old fashioned mercury standing sphignomanometers (blood pressure thingy for the layman) and we were judged for our "technique" and these skill tests are usually graded very harshly....so I'm proud of myself....  In other news I have seriously considered chalking up the semester and restarting next year as a four year Freshman....I would be taking basically the same classes and whether I could really do it was never an issue....it was just a matter of having the right mind frame....and right now I STILL have too many loose ends at home to tie up....I'm on the road to full recovery of self....I'm just not all the way there yet  I had a really nice convo with a lady from Clark Atlanta University last night....our convo began with me having to defend my alma mater (Dear old  urlLink Morehouse  for the unintiated....how did you get here???...LOL)....and I realized that, while Morehouse may look like a really good place to those who only read "mainstream" press and the propaganda they send out, Morehouse has some serious PR problems brewing....the gays, malcontents whose parents force them to go there, and general arrogant jackoffs that comprise a large amount (although NOT the majority) of the student population are making Morehouse a hard pill to swallow for many of those in contact with them daily....now I will never be ashamed nor apologize for being a Morehouse Man....I was well prepared for life in general, as well as grad work, by Morehouse.....it is an excellent school and my experience there was unforgettable....but the big wigs need to work on improving the PR for my generation.....  Speaking of the AUC....congrats to the following....Spence, JT, Neil, Van, Dawud, Smitty, Jared (Squire), Randall, young Kathy, Rebecah, Bridgit, Deah (you shoulda told me!!....I woulda been there for you!), Tiffany, and the Kappa dudes (not gonna blow ya'll up yet...I'll wait till the proper time)....my neophyte Greek friends....remember your roots....and remember how you got to the point you are now.....I'm proud of all of you!  One last note....as is the early morning custom I was watching a Different World and an episode I had completely forgotten about came on.....it featured Tisha Campbell and Whoopi Goldberg....Whoopi was a dynamic speech teacher who helped Tisha (who I keep wanting to call Gina....that is typecasting folks!!!) to get the courage to tell everyone she had HIV/AIDS.....A Different World was really highly slept on....a truly great show...ahead of it's time!  Holla later....e-mail me at Killacal13@aol.com or on the instant messenger (I'm ALWAYS at least online....you might get an away message but those are the breaks eh?)

      Lots of things today....  Watched "The Game" the other night....it was really, really good....made me look at the way I live my life in a new light....  Thank you to Kelly for giving me a cold dose of realness one time....I am kinda boring....I like things rather mundane....granted I do get extra wild on occassion (usually alcohol or weed induced) for the most part I like my routine and I don't want much to interfere with that.....but I feel something awakening in my persona lately....I've been more vocal about how I really feel....I have been more assertive in my wants and desires....we'll see where this goes but I feel something stirring....  I am happier now than I've been in quite a long time....no particular reason to point to other than my Dad's steady recovery....I am enjoying life for the first time in 2002....I think I needed the down time.....  In Blackplanet I got into my first large scale argument.....I don't want to go into details because a)it's over and done with and b)it wasn't that crucial to begin with....but the whole experience did bring up a much larger point to me that I feel applies in life in general (not just digitized binary life....which is all some people apparently have).....the point is I appreciate people who bring it real, live, and direct to me a whole lot more than people who smile in your face and talk behind your back....although I don't respect the dude I was arguing with for many and varied reasons I can at least respect the fact that we aired out our issues like men and got it all out in the open....there are certain people that for whatever reason cannot do this....there are people I know for a fact are in my life that do not like me, yet put up a front like they do....if you don't like me it would behoove you to say so....let feelings be known and we can go forward from there because I don't have time for shadiness....I need all the light I can get right now....

      Been an eventful weekend....  I won't talk about my tests....not worth mentioning....  Friday night was a "Martini" party...cocktails mixed by yours truly.....I had fun....  Saturday went to the mall and in one fell swoop got caught up with my X-Men comics.....yeah I'm a big effing kid...I bought three "trade paperbacks" basically collected story arcs....I also bought Harlem Nights on DVD....guilty pleasure....  Sunday I rested....then went back to the mall....got a Milwaukee Brewers jersey and a t-shirt....and three more movies....Rounders, The Game, and Star Wars Episode 1.....I figured I couldn't go into Attack of the Clones (which has to be ten times better by default) without giving the Phantom Menace one more shot....this brings my DVD total over 120 which should be illegal....  Just got done watching the 20 most contraversial (sp?....who cares!) videos according to MTV....of course there was no Public Enemy or NWA....but they did manage to surprise me with a 2 Live Crew clip....the choice for number one (*****SPOILER ALERT*****Prodigy....Smack my Bitch Up....your bad for missing it) was new to me....I never caught it in the week that they showed it....it DID live up to the hype though....I caught the surprise ending before it caught me....I saw it coming a mile away but it was still something interesting....  Back to the grind tomorrow....it's the anchor leg of the relay....the homestretch....gotta call in my reserves....can I make it?.....we'll see!

      I was all prepared to type a few words about how no one talks about Shaq's lack of free throw shooting ability anymore when I turned on my TV this morning to MTV as I usually do on the commercial break for A Different World....  Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes left the world of the living yesterday after a fatal car crash in Honduras....  I was a big TLC fan....I can't front....I am also a lifelong Falcons fan.....so the Left Eye and Andre Rison saga was a big deal to me.....I remember when they duked it out in front of Club Flava in the Dec....and I remember when they got arrested in the grocery store parking lot....they were the first large scale dysfunctional couple that I knew about....I told a few house burning jokes....but I admired the way she took it all in stride (crazy as she was).....I had a crush on her first (before I jumped on the whole Chilli/Tatyana Ali theme that has dominated most of my post pubescent years)....overall I dug Left Eye....I was interested in what moves she was going to make with Death Row (probably something wack....but still)....more importantly....another Icon for our generation is lost....our parents had to deal with Jimi, Marvin, John Lennon, etc.....arguably deeper individuals (though they were all absorbed in negative aspects of life as well to some extent)....well, we have lost Pac, Biggie, Aaliyah, and now Left Eye....listening to "Waterfalls" will never be the same again....  One love Left Eye!

      Lazy Sunday mornings are my favorite.....  Last night there was an "interesting" array of movies on cable....one of my favorite bad, bad movies, "Showgirls" was on TNT....boy oh boy where to begin with that crapfest....the script in that movie is sooooo bad that it becomes funny....like my man Bill Simmons from ESPN.com would say it rates a 100 out of 100 on the unintentional comedy scale....Glenn Plummer is at his absolute worse as the Anti-Don Cheadle....and Jesse Spano overacts her ass off....but the three best characters to me are the bitchy black dancer who gets dropped, Gina Gershon's slutty Cristal Conners with lezbo tendancies, and Jesse Spano's sexually repressed black rooommate Annie....I'm telling you if you get past all of the gratuitous nudity (which TNT does inexplicably) you have a very good bad, bad movie....  On the flipside, "Scarface" was on the History Channel....each time I watch it again I enjoy it more and more but I have a confession to make....I had never seen ANY of Scarface before this year....yes, all through high school and college I would wing it whenever Scarface references were made.....I don't know what the deal was but I had avoided Pacino flicks like the plague....hadn't seen Carlito's Way until sophomore year of college....anyway I watched it by myself the first time (I was told that was a mistake)....I didn't think it really lived up to all the hype....well having seen it a couple more times it has grown on me more and more....  Finally, I haven't done it in awhile so it's time for me to mention the top five songs of the moment for the Killa Cal  5)Oooooh This Love Is So - Al B. Sure....and I have OJ to blame for this....I listen to Al B. Sure everynight before I go to bed now thanks to this fool....  4)Spend the Night In Your Mind - Ceelo Green.....this is the best song on the best CD to come out this year in my opinion (and I've bought the most CD's this year since the summer after Freshman year in college)  3)Dangerously in Love - Destiny's Child....this song has officially entered the coveted Calvin Pantheon of Great Songs.....  2)Special Delivery (remix) - G-Dep, P. Diddy, Ghostface Killah, Craig Mack, and Keith Murray....I hated the original with a passion....but the remix is HOT....I will be buying the album "We Invented the Remix"  1)You Don't Have To Call - Usher...yep this song says so much by saying so little....I sing it in the shower, walking up the street, in class, in the car when other songs are playing....  Honorable mention goes to the Fat Joe song with Ashanti on the hook....when I install my harddrive on Monday that is the first song I will download....  Be back later!

      Before I begin this post  urlLink go see what this idiot Mike Tyson has said now.   Okay....now that we have that out of the way....I plan to offer my take on three things I've seen/heard in the past two days....DVD-Spy Game, New Release Movie-Spiderman, and NEW Music-Musiq "Juslisen"  First up Spy Game....well acted....mostly a man on a mission agains higher forces type deal....must admit I haven't seen many Robert Redford performances so I have little to judge from but he performed very well here....the plot was believable with only a few stretches of shaky logic....good direction....the DVD is loaded with special features.....not groundbreaking but good enough to keep you wanting more for 2 hours....I'd give it 3 and a half out of 5 stars.....  Now Spiderman....I want to approach this movie from two ends....firstly as a comic book geek (yes I STILL read comics)....I didn't get into Spidey as much when I was younger although I have read all of the essentials....without giving away too much of the movie I will say that it was extremely faithful to the origins stated on pulp.....of course certain liberties were taken for the benefit of 21st century moviegoers and their intellectual lazinesss but that is too be expected....the characterizations were ON POINT....everything was right to me....it was as if someone had taken the pages of Amazing Fantasy 15 (first Spidey story) and the first few story arcs of Spidey and translated them directly.....all in all it was the best conversion from comic to movie since Superman (yes even better than Batman)....  Now as a film critic....the movie did suffer a little from cheap scary moments (I mean how cliche is it to splice in a scary face and turn the volume waaaaay up to make the audience jump....you can come better than that Sam Raimi....you made Evil Dead!!!)....Other than that the complaints are few....there were no dead patches in the movie, all loose ends were tied up....as I said about Spy Games it was nothing groundbreaking but the movie was VERY entertaining....overall I would give it 4.25 stars out of 5....  Finally Musiq's latest release....now usually I go track for track with my analysis (I DO actually have a history of critiquing albums check the archives at  urlLink Club AUC....look under AUC interactive, entertainment section ....however it's early (11 AM on a saturday might as well be 7 AM on Monday)....so I will say that it was what I expected.....a very solid album....overall it's not the best album to be released this year (Ceelo Green and His Perfect Imperfections gets that title)....but it's a good buy nonetheless (if R&B is your thing)....  I'll probably come back and do a track for track....but peace for now....

      I'm sitting here perusing profiles on Blackplanet....it never ceases to amaze me the kind of things I see there....for instance  one girl has the song "My neck, my back" playing in the background....hopefully this song is a regional "phenomenon" (I use that word in the loosest possible sense)....basically her neck and back are the only two places she wishes to be licked that you can say on the radio....at any rate in the same breath this young lady asks for respect and this that and the other....why do people do this?.....why do you want to be objectified in one thought and then exalted in another?....why do you cuss like a sailor and in the same breath profess to be a child of God....BP is full of such paradoxes....now I am no saint, nowhere near it....but I also try my very best not to play the role of hypocrite....oh well.....  So yesterday I had another OSCE....I'm sure I talked about OSCE's before....this one went pretty smoothly beside my one classmate acting an ass....you know that joke from Kings of Comedy where DL Hughely talks about the one person at everyone's job whose ass everyone wants to beat....well this guy is the prototype....and I really hope to God that I'm not the one who does what everyone else wants to do and introduces him to a hard, fast-flying fist....

      Random thoughts today....  Shouts out to the homie 4ever  urlLink O2thaJ  for the proggy to clean up my overactive computer....  X-Tra Special Dedications to  urlLink Killa Kel  for the recommendations on the Portishead songs....I now know what people were raving about before....it's good stuff....  My subscription to Entertainment Weekly and Maxim have caused me to wonder why we (blacks) don't have those types of publications....no offense to Ebony, Jet, Black Enterprise or their readers....but it seems to me that to write for these publications you must sign a waiver turning over anything resembling a sense of humor....I mean really....is there a non-patronizing Black magazine with some sense of an edge....why doesn't Chris Rock or someone like that take on that task?....We did it twice a month at the Maroon Tiger so I know it can be done....we brought the news and current issues while at the same time maintaining a tongue in cheek sarcasm that seems to be reserved only for college students.....oh well maybe my buddy  urlLink Beth  will do that for me....  My dad is doing so much better and I feel so great about it....he left me a message on my voice-mail in typical C. Miles fashion with a movie reference (New Jack City....he called me Nino Brown)....thanks once again to all those who have shown concern, compassion, whatever....it means alot to me for real!  I can't wait to go back to Atlanta for Morehouse's graduation (and the other AUC graduations for that matter)....Hopefully I will be able to handle all of my excess business in Atlanta (pick up the car, tie up some loose ends with some friends, eat at Lafonda)....  Songs of the moment (no particular order)....  1) Musiq - Half Crazy....This dude can do no wrong so far....yet another in a series of Musiq songs I am feeling....I can't wait to go to the hook up spot on Friday and pick this up....  2)Portishead - Roads....This is the first song that Kelly told me about and also the best of the ones I've heard....why did it take me so long to wake up and listen to this???  3)Cameo - She's Strange....Partly because this song applies to so many women in my life right now....and partly cuz the cameo never gets old  4)Janet Jackson - Would You Mind....Janet has a way with words.....and she has her way with the words on this one....  5)Ceelo - Bad Mutha...."I'm bad, I'm bad, I know I'm bad".....it reminds me of growing up in Southwest Atlanta....where stuck up kids "thought they were bad"....  Also worth noting:  That video by this chick Truth Hurts is one of the scariest things in creation....I don't like the cut of her jib....  The Fresh Prince of Bel Air was an aight lil show in hindsight....  A Different World on TBS is in the stretch run right now....the zenith....the apex....the creme de le creme....this morning's shows were the episode where Ron and Dwayne have a run in with racist football fans (also known as the episode with Mr. Carosi from the Beach episodes of Saved by the Bell) and the episode with the fake ex-con who gets treated badly while using questionable journalistic techniques (also known as the episode where Dwayne Wayne makes his only faux pas of the entire run of the series and tells him to "go to Morehouse with that")  That's enought for now....I'll be back when I get the feeling....

      Today is a special day for me....  Eighteen years ago today  urlLink my baby sister Che  was born....  Me and my other beautiful sister Nina were sent to a friend of the family's as my mother gave birth to Che.....I'll never forget that day....my baby sister who has already gotten a perfect score on her math SAT, skipped a grade, been a student at GA governor's honors program, and gotten a presidential scholarship at Spelman is 18 today....  Next year on Feb. 9th my beautiful, charismatic sister Nina will turn 21....Nina knows me better than anyone else....I have spent more time with Nina than anyone else....I admire her so much....sometimes we argue but there isn't a single person on Earth I'd rather have on my side than Nina....  If you put Nina and Che in the same room the first question that gets asked invariably is if they are twins....and the way they work together you would think they are....they take notes for one another about various events....they have codewords and special slang about different people we know....in short they make a perfect team....sometimes I feel like a priviledged outsider when I watch them interact....the week they came up to visit me is easily the best week of this very terrible year so far....I can't wait till they come back next month!  Days like today really cause me to sit back and reflect on how blessed I am....Happy Birthday lil Che Che!!!.....your big brother is proud of you!

      Reading back it seems I focus too much on the negative....I am going to work on that....  In that vein, my mother has been running into alot of my old friends lately....I have been blessed without alot of good, true friends wherever I go....anyway my boy Rashard came by the house the other day and spent about an hour talking with my mom....Rashard is a really good guy, I can't recall him ever having a bad word to say about anyone and he just has a really good heart....that's my nigga I'll do anything for him....  Talking to my mom this morning she was telling me she ran into one of my OLDEST friends....when we started really getting into it I realized that I've known this guy longer than I hae known even Nile (3rd grade), Eulus (2nd grade), and Rashard (1st Grade).....I've known Bryan P. since Kindergarten....I just typed it, yet it doesn't even seem real....I've known this guy since I was five....I will be twenty-three in eight days....  This guy Bryan P. is is the smartest guy I know....I say this without flinching or giving it a second thought.....I'm not just talking book smarts either (and he definately was book smart).....this guy had a way with dealing with people at such a young age.....I don't think I have TERRIBLE people skills, but I could brush up.....this guy had a way of dealing with people that was so smooth....and we were KIDS....anyway as we grew older we fell into different crowds.....I was a classic nerd....he was the most popular guy in the class....but we always had a friendship....he always had my back and he saved me from alot of traumatizing incidents....nothing in it for him except, I figure, he valued our friendship, which was predated me wearing glasses and others discovering my smartness....he was always down for me....anyways we went to different high schools and I always made a point of at least keeping word of how he was doing....I don't recall whether he actually finished Mays....I had heard rumors that he was doing the job corp thing....I gotta be real and say that I didn't really think he was going to make it for awhile....so imagine my delight after this morning's conversation with my mom....my mom taught his brother and I'll never forget when she told me about a conversation she had with their mother one day....she told me, "Dexter is the exact same way that Bryan was when he was his age.....and she's  worried "....well I don't think she has as much to worry about anymore....moms tells me that he is married now with a child....he keeps up with another childhood friend and they are all doing the same thing I'm doing....TRYING TO MAKE IT....I try my best not to be judgemental (although being judgemental is a basic human characteristic....so I will be guilty once in a while)....  In other news another of my good friends, Nile (of the San Antonio road trip), is graduating from Morehouse on Sunday....this guy and I have enough stories to write three or four books....we started out at Morehouse together....same dorm, same floor....us being roommates would have never worked because we can't be around each other for that long a time (I   need   the ablility to kick him out....our friendship thrives on it)....his road differed from mine but we both reached the same end point....I'm proud as hell of him!  I'm headed home in the next threee hours....I'm excited....I get to see my dad....I get to see my mom....I get to see my sisters....I get a much needed break from Nashville....I get to kick it in my hometown, the great city of Atlanta....I'll only be home for six days....but something tells me that's all I will need....

      I guess I shoulda wrote that tribute to Moms after all....cuz now I am sicker than I've ever been.....of course she gave this cold to me and my Grandmother so no amount of words would have prevented me from getting sick....but still....  I haven't been this sick since I was laid up with the flu Junior year of college....and I had a test this morning...needless to say I don't think I did so hot on it....oh well.....all of this is starting to look nonsensical....I'll holla later...

      Okay....so much to say....  Firstly....today I have been listening to Musiq (Mary Go Round, Halfcrazy, and Girl Next Door), Fiona Apple (about 20 songs) and Free Bird by Lynrard Skynard....no particular reason for mentioning that.....  Took my mom's, my sisters, my cousin Bryan's son Malik, and his mother Melanie to breakfast today for Mother's Day....it was really cool....moms and them were here for TSU's graduation.....my cousin  urlLink Radiance  graduated on Saturday....it was a nice ceremony....reminded me of last May 20th when I finished Morehouse....ahhhhh....  Hopefully I will be back in the ATL in time to catch a few senior week parties....my first graduation as an Alum should be really cool!  I had more stuff I wanted to say but I feel a touch of the cold my mom had getting passed to me so I am about to make some tea....I refuse to let a cold get me!!!  I know I usually write tributes and what not on special days but I wrote my mom a nice e-mail awhile back and I don't think she comes here (I kinda hope she doesn't) so I don't wanna waste words....I love her...she loves me....you only get one mom and my mom is the best....she raised a good young man if I may be so bold to say so....

      I've got more to say....  So for those that are wondering....here is what happened this week....  Saturday last....I got into Atlanta sometime in the afternoon courtesy of my classmate Ama (safe and sound)....we went to a graduation party for the homie Voltaire who finished Morehouse with a GPA at least a full point higher than I finished with (he's the man!!).....then we went to the homie Nile's house for his graduation party....it was over by the time we got there but I came bearing gifts....he called Me, Kasi, and Malachi the Three Wise men carrying Hennesy, Frankenspice, and Mirh (or however you spell it....and yes I know it's not frankenspice but that's what he said)....anyway the Hennessy bottle almost got us in trouble....after awhile of me catching up with my boys Reggie and Maurice and flirting with Nicole (one day she will see I was serious) his mother comes downstairs....long story short I had to make a blood promise to her that the son she worked so hard and yelled so much for would walk across the stage the next day....he did....  Still Saturday....we headed back to Kasi's and changed....met up with Antoy and headed to Cafe Something or the other at Lenox Mall for an Alumni Party....I was the youngest person in there by about five years (or so it seemed)....then we headed to Fuel....all the while drinking copious amounts of Crown Royal and Scotch....needless to say I was pretty gone by the end of the night....so I hope my good friend  urlLink Beth   can find it in her heart to forgive me for the silly way I behaved when I saw her in NYC's parking lot....  Sunday....after two hours of sleep we headed to Morehouse's graduation....I felt a surge of electricity flow through my body as I stepped onto the campus green....Julian Bond was in the middle of his speech when I arrived....I saw alot of old friends and some people I would have rather not have seen but I was in my element....I had many friends walk....I took a moment and sat with my good friend Travis's family as he walked across the stage and I was also able to give Nile's family the thumbs up as he passed behind me....the best moment of graduation for me (well besides seeing a couple of long standing crushes) was when Nile passed through the processional and hugged me....I was really happy for him....  After graduation we hung around a minute taking in the sights and then headed to Cafe Intermezzo to meet our boy Damian and his family....I had a great Breakfast Burrito (of course under a fancy name)....we had good sports related conversation mostly about the draft....I enjoyed myself....after breakfast I meet up with my mom and we head to my Uncle Steve's house to see my dad....  Dad looked good!....he is still in his wheelchair but he was in good spirits and we enjoyed some great Barbeque....my Aunt Kym and her son Lil Conrad came by and we all really enjoyed ourselves....later on my mom came back and my sister Nina got off of work and came through....we talked with Uncle Steve and then me and Nina left....I don't feel inclined to say much else about me and my sister's conversation other than I learned so much about her strength....people put alot of talk into me and Che but I see the   BIGGEST   things coming from Nina.....  Monday....I woke up late (as is the custom on my visits to the ATL) and headed to Uncle Steve's....I met his physical therapist Phyllis....she was really nice and it turns out she is related to one of my classmates....Dad did really well....it seemed he was a little pressed about doing really well for my sisters and I, but his progress is amazing....we spent the rest of the afternoon eating leftovers from Sunday and watching movies....I had planned to spend the night so my sisters left and Uncle Steve, Aunt Phenola, her father Big Daddy, my pops, and I watched Scarface....I really didn't give it it's due the first time I saw it....it was really a great flick....  Tuesday....My dad got a visit from his speech therapist, Pam....she was also really nice and she worked really well with Dad....then we headed to see my uncle Harvey....he is due to have some work done on his back and he was in alot of pain but you would never know it unless he told you so....my Auntie's Gee Gee and Stella also came by along with my cousin Margie and her daughter Jamilah (spelling man....I always say these names....never have to spell them) and a friend of Uncle Harvey's Dr. Hill....we had good conversation on the state of the world (mostly me, Auntie Gee Gee, and Uncle Steve) and good ham sandwiches....but more importantly I think it was good for Dad to see all of them and vice versa.....we headed back to Decatur and I went to see the lovely aforementioned Beth....we had good conversation with a side of Mickey D's and she let me listen to the new Eminem (a must buy if only for Superman)  Wednesday....once again destination Decatur, but not before being entertained by my six year old cousin Jasmine...she is a trip and a half....she sang Lil Bow Weezie for me and did some impressions....she is the greatest....so anyway we brought some KFC over for Dear Old Dad....spent some QT....then I headed to my friend Tiffany's....I am kinda selfish and I sorta inconvienenced her in just dropping by unexpectedly and then having her take me home....I felt really bad about it cuz I live far, far away and I didn't have the use of anyone's car....if you ever read this I'm SORRY TIFF!!!  Thursday....I went to lunch with my friend Lyndsey at my favorite spot in Atlanta, La Fonda Latina.....then we picked up her sister and saw Spiderman (for the third time....still love it)....then I went to see my Aunt Lynette who has by now surely found the URL to this site since I slipped up and mentioned it in conversation....  Friday....most of the time was spent either packing or on the road back to Nashville care of my cousin Radiance  Which leads to today....checked out two and a half movies (that is how movie hopping goes....they don't synchrnoze the movies for you!...the un-facists!!!) Insomina (pretty good not great), Enough (better than I expected...need to catch the other half), and Unfaithful (great!!....must own on DVD!).....and I caught the end (and best part) of the Celtics game....went and harrassed some of my peoples...  And that is my busy week...it probably took a week to read all of this....and in the Eastern Time Zone I am 23 years old....Happy Birthday to me!!

      In a matter of a few hours I will be 23 years old....  It's funny how in the past year I've seen the extreme highs and lows of my life....  I graduated from Morehouse a little before my 22nd birthday but that was easily the best moment of my young life....  The evening of January 1st, 2002 is easily the worst few hours of my life as my dad's life hung in the balance and he came within a few minutes of dying....  This year has taught me alot about who I am....  I started medical school, an accomplishment that I think I take for granted more often than not....  I also moved away from Atlanta and started to gain some independance (bills)....  I have established good credit (let's keep it this way)....  I have gotten closer to my sister Nina (subject of a post all its own soon enough)....  I have gained some really good friends here in Nashville....  I lost my grandmother and aunt....  But I think the most important thing is that I have lived another 365 days....more hard days than easy ones, but I have the feeling that these days are going to be the ones that shape my life forever....I know that I will always remember the year I was 22....someone very wise said you should always be careful what you wish for....I think I wished that I would never ever forget my 22nd year of life....well the Almighty has made certain of that....I will never forget it....

      The program started today....and I am sooooo exhausted.....  It should be an interesting summer at the very least....there are some of the usual suspects....the girls with bad attitudes....the guys who plan to pull all the females....and now I have this new role as the Teacher....yeah...I'm teaching Math to these undergrad rascals....like i said...should be interesting....  So I just got back from eating Indian food with Beth and Jylana....Jylana was driving my dream car....all I could think about was changing the color to that cold ass grey and keeping the drop top down....dinner was good although we were left in questioon about our "non" (unclear about the spelling)....they brought out some tortilla like substance and we were like "surely they jest"....after a while they brought out the real "non"....I enjoyed the meal and the company :-)  Well I have another long day ahead of me tomorrow....

      The Birthday was great....  I'd like to thank Shanna, Tasha, Demeka, Heather, Mom and the sisters(first ones to call), Dad, Radiance (for being a great cousin), Lou, Crystal, Johnny, Phonso, Natasha, Tonya, Angela, Geoff, Jeralyn, Luther, Candace, Romney, Daana, OJ, Kelly, Beth, Dani, Toya J, Johanna, Nile, Reggie, Maurice, Nacosta, Tiff, Tiff, Tiff (I know too many Tiffany's), Alex, Lenia, Shawanna, and everyone else (I'm a bad memory guy....sorry) who careed enough to wish me a happy birthday or did something to make my day special....you made me a happy guy on a day I was trying not to be happy on....  I bought myself a copy of Fight Club (my other copy is considered a loss at this point), P. Diddy's newest absurd claim, The Eminem Show, and the book Red Dragon....  the P. Diddy CD is a good party CD....Fight Club on DVD is essential....Red Dragon is one of the best books ever, soon to be one of the better movies out (better than Manhunter for sure!)....  okay but lets talk about the Eminem Show....White America is pretty solid....not great....but I won't just up and skip it either....Business is about the same....Cleaning Out My Closet is where it starts to get Eminem-like....the gloves come off with his mom.....I don't know what to say except I'm happy that I love my family....Square Dance is kinda like something from the second album in as much as flow and content....solid track....a pretty funny skit revolving around the Kim incident with the bouncer is next....I like albums with worthwhile skits....Em usually has a few....Soldier, Say Goodbye Hollywood, and Drips are kinda lacking at least so far.....you've heard Without Me if you have a radio or television....not much I can say about that that would sway you in one direction or another....  Another Skit with Paul Rosenberg (he was the guy yelling on the Marshall Mathers LP) telling Em ot leave his gun at home....good if you like skits (I do)....Sing For the Moment is blahhhhhh....but then comes the stretch run.....and this is what makes the album worthwhile....Superman is the best song on the album to me....they'll probably play it out on the radio this summer with a few minor (language) changes....enjoy it before then the last verse is where it gets really good...Hailie's Song has some bad singing and as is the case usually with bad singing you either love it or hate it....my boy thinks that the one rapped verse on this cut is the best on the album.....that's arguable....it's a good verse....great song....what would an Eminem album be without Steve Berman?....well maybe the next one won't have him as a result of the end of this skit....another good skit....When the Music Stops is another pretty good one especially if you like D12 (then again I don't think most people not named Killa Cal liked D12)....Bizarre does his thing at the end if you are a clever enough listener....Say What You Say (the JD diss song) has some bad rapping by gay ass Dre which will probably arouse more speculation about his sexuality than quell it (don't think I don't read your lil interviews???....keep me AND TIMBERLAND's names out your mouth??....don't cosign for another producer dude!)....but oh well....Em holds up his end of the bargain, it's an aight song....Till I Collapse is another of my favorites....he brings it pretty raw and real on this track....and I like his list of his top rappers....the last real song on the album is My Dad's Gone Crazy featuring his daughter Hailie Jade....it's a decent song....nice touch of adding Hailie....  All in all it's not the Marshall Mathers LP....like my boy was telling me after he bought it, there is no stand out like Stan....Superman comes close but it's not an instant classic....it's a good buy....it's neck and neck with Ceelo for best album of the year so far....  Time to hit the sack...I found out I'm teaching Math this summer....this should be interesting....

      I woke up this morning for a twenty third year....8401 days of life (including leap years)....here are some of my favorite things:  Tom and Jerry Cartoons, A Different World, Saved By The Bell, Quesadillas Con Chorizo from La Fonda Latina, White Pizza at Fellini's, intellectual women, soft hair, women with glasses, Robert De Niro/Al Pacino movies, the mind bender at six flags, a slightly watered down Dewars Scotch and Tonic, a perfectly mixed Tom Collins with Bombay Sapphire Gin, the Long Island Ice Teas at the Box Seat, Braves wins, Football blowouts, close Basketball games, Brooks Brothers Ties, Issey Miyake, Goodfellas (the movie not the cheap Ashanit video remake), Scarface, Unfaithful, Spiderman, the commentary track from the Bamboozled DVD, the whole DVD concept, Grand Theft Auto 3, NBA Live (the series), aggressive women, hair coloration (preferably blonde streaks or all red), my family, my crew from senior year (Eulus, BJ, Will, and Danny), IDT, my Meharry fam, cute girls with a wry sense of humor, Sanaa Lathan, Heather Hunter (yeah I shouldn't know who she is....but I do...deal with it), Halle Berry, Monica Calhoun (sweet Mia from the Best Man), and one other woman who will know soon enough if she doesn't already (I'm almost ready...)....  I'm thankful to God for life....I wouldn't change a thing.....

      See....I talked Sherry Carter up!!.....she was on a commercial for Blockbuster video shamelessly plugging some bad movies....  Anyways I'm concerned about one of the bloggers I read (and who also reads me)....I really hope everything is alright....and if there is anything I can do for you, you know how you can reach me if you feel the need to talk....I hope it all works itself out...but know that I'm here if you need me!  That's all for now....

      Man....I just got done watching Forrest Gump (well the tail end of it) on HBO2....  I love that movie on so many levels....it has great music first of all...each song fits the scene perfectly....especially "Free Bird" when Jenny is on the ledge....some people don't like the little quirks with Forrest being involved with various historical events....I do!....but more than anything Forrest's unconditional love for his friends (especially Jenny) is what hooks me everytime....  All of the flawed characters he meets are taken in unconditionally by Forrest....he has concern for others that alot of my classmates would do well to notice....  The scene where he meets his son really gets me....but lately the scene where I'm apt to shed a few is when he's talking to Jenny's grave....  I love Forrest Gump....  In other news, it was discovered that I have a new channel, MTV Jams, that might actually be better than VH1 Soul....they show a good mix of Hip Hop and R&B like the old show Bill "I can't believe I get paid to be this bufoonish" Bellamy used to host....now all I need is the return of Video Soul with Sherry Carter and Donny Simpson on Prime Time....I can dream can't I?

      So far I like this group of kids I'm working with....there are a few random complainers....but they seem pretty cool for the most part....  I want to talk about unsung songs right now though....songs that are buried somewhere on someone's soundtrack, played late at night on the quiet storm, or just a good song stuck on a bad album....alot of the songs on my 3000 strong MP3 list are like this....  So I'm listening to Jill Scott "Dreamin"....this song was on the In Too Deep soundtrack....it's basically a version of beautiful dreamer....very nice and mellow....good Sunday morning music....  Norman Conners "Valentine Love" is another....it's basically a duet between some unknown male and female....it sounds very similar to "Golden Time of Day" by Frankie Beverly and Maze....he is also behind the "You Are My Starship" song...  O' Brien did probably the best cover of any Stevie Wonder song ever in his version of "You and I"....he made changes in the song that made it his own....yet it retained the essence of the song....as opposed to the just as good yet more "coverish" "Ribbon in the Sky" by Intro....  In the category of "I shouldn't like this terrible song but I do" is "Straight F*cking" by Gator and the Transitions on the Baby Boy Soundtrack (actually that whole soundtrack is pretty great!)....it's the song playing when Jody goes to visit Pandora....it might just be me showing my quirks....but I kinda dig that song....  Kilo Ali's "Love in Ya Mouth" was a hit in Atlanta....and with an appearance by Big Boi it qualifies as a highly slept on song for Outkast fans looking for a good verse from the dynamic duo....  Ghostface Killa's favorite band from his youth must be Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band with his reworkings of Cher Chez La Femme (Cher Chez Le Ghost) and Sunshowers (Ghost Showers)....Sunshowers was the song that haunted me for so long as "that song playing in Rickey and Doughboy's house when young Trey comes to visit them"....you know the scene where Tyra Ferrell is telling young Doughboy that he wasn't sh!t and would never be sh!t....  Well it's time to throw some food together....

       urlLink Kelly is back!!   And speaking of Kelly I have new found respect for her (on top of the mounds of respect I already had)....teaching is   MUCH   harder than it looks....I only lasted an hour and 10 minutes of the two hours I was alotted....I really hope I don't have two hour sessions in the future.....it's hard trying to talk to a group of students who look like they really don't want to be there, especially when it's your first time teaching....Kel and Moms can have teaching....I know now that teaching cannot be a plan B at all for me....  In other news, I felt a part of me die on Saturday night after Mike Tyson was emasculated by Lennox Lewis....it was agonizing to watch after the 3rd round....being the true fan that I am I was pulling for Mike up until the 5th or 6th round (or maybe I just disliked Lennox Lewis   THAT   much)....but after that point I wanted Lennox to put him out of his misery....Mike looked terrible out there....a few friends and I have discussed the very real possibility that Mike was actually fighting on Zoloft or Valium because after the first round he just looked completely subdued....the man didn't even try to block the jabs after the 3rd round for Pete's sake!....  On another completely different note....I am once again at odds with myself on the whole notion of marriage....I know, I know.....why is this 23 year old black, male, medical student frustrating himself over something that he very clearly should not be thinking about?....I really wish I knew....but lately I have been feeling like I either will never WANT to get married or I will end up settling for someone....neither of those options is very appealing to me....maybe I should just not sweat it eh?....I'll try....  Anyway I should probably show up to Meharry soon....more to come later....

      Well I realize I kinda left whoever reads this rag hanging on the whole pops issue....  He never had the surgery....long story short they had some problems making sure he was able to breath adequately while anesthized...when he came to after not having anything done he was kind of upset, but other than that he is fine....I appreciate all of the well wishes and prayers....it meant (and still does mean) alot to me and my family....  I feel very blessed in the fact that I have so many quality associations and friends....  In other news, I made what I thought to be an easy test for my class to take while I was away.....turns out it was not so easy as the class average was a 16.1 out of 25....I'm at my wits end because the hardest question on the test was a 10th grade level question....I wasn't trying to humble anyone or break any backs....I want these people to do well and get into med school....I'm going to try some suggestions that my mother gave me....  Flipping the script.....I am starting to think that I just cannot read women's signals....I am certain that there are a couple of ladies around here who are feeling me but I haven't picked up on any of the signals at all....it's like I'm blind to them....or maybe my mind is elsewhere with some other unresolved feelings....I'm not entirely sure....I know for certain that I feel very strongly about a woman that I know, but the time and other circumstances are not right for me to make a move on it....  Life is all about the tough decisions....one of these days I'm going to have to hop off of the fence into one yard or another....just not yet....

      It's Father's Day.....  My Father is still with me today and that is a blessing....  I am in Atlanta now and earlier I was at my Uncle Steve's house (where my dad is staying) in Decatur....we talked about alot.....but I think the biggest thing was the idea for a family reunion....with all of the set backs that my family has faced in the past year we pretty much came to a consensus that a family reunion is in order....spearheaded by my cousin Steve, with the idea that we need to get together under happy occassions instead of always getting together when a loved one dies (as has been the case for a while now)....I really hope we can make that happen....  In other news I am in town for Father's Day but more importantly my Dad is having surgery tomorrow at 6am....please remember him in prayer....hopefully this will be the end of this saga and we can continue to move forward with life.....  Happy Father's Day.....I know I'm happy

      New York, New York big city of dreams....  I've never been to New York....closest I've gotten is getting onto the wrong train in Baltimore (New York bound when I was actually headed to Washington)....well I've been giving serious thought to heading to New York for this Morehouse/Spelman Alumni party....we shall see very soon....  In other news, the word on the street is that I am teetering very close to being fired from one of my jobs....what scares me is that I really don't care at this point....I'm sure there will be more to say about this whole saga very soon....  I have eaten more free food today than the law should allow....got me a nice western omelet from the hospital (BANGING), a chicken snack with beans and some potato salad that I didn't eat, some pizza, and a portion of a sub sandwich, not to mention the Rice Krispie treat....yummie yummie....  Last night I attended a Kegger thrown by one of my great classmates, Sean.....I hit the keg hard and fast....when I got home my head was swimming....I thought I was gonna call my ole friend Earl.....but that leads me to another point....why is it when you get drunk you just go through your call list and just call people at random?....I woke up this morning and a friend asked me why I called and told her I was in NY and the Statue of Liberty was moving....I think there should be a law about drunk people and cell phones....like a breathalizer in the speaker end or something to prevent semi retarded people like myself from making as ass of themself....

       urlLink This just seems right....   I need to take lessons from Smoove B man, I'm telling you!....that guy is on it!  I wrote three poems while sitting in a boring endocrinology lecture.....I debated whether I should publish them or not....I decided towards not....  Today is a self wallowing day.....I need a hug from someone....maybe I'll get one....I went and spent more money that I don't have at Banana Republic....some how this cycle must end....

      Minority Report was much better than I expected it to be....the vision of the future that exists in the mind of Steven Spielberg is truly a wonder....not merely the twists and turns taken, but also the things that many filmmakers take for granted (such as memorable dialogue and characters with depth) were all well done....by the by, the previews for Goldmember and the new Bond flick look OUTSTANDING!....this is shaping up to be one of the better movie summers....  In sports....I am officially a World Cup junkie....despite the fact that I drank for 7 hours Friday I still woke up at 6:30 Saturday to watch the World Cup game....go Brazil....the Braves are hot....but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the tragedy in Chicago....St. Louis pitcher Darryl Kile (a damned good pitcher) was found dead in his hotel room....autopsy pending, I really hope it wasn't a murder....  I had more to say....but not now....maybe when my mind is clearer....(hint....it involves women....come on now what else do I think about?....music???...come on now....not anymore)

      I have one goal in my immediate future....putting on some more clothes and getting my morning Western Omelet....but I'm sitting here listening to George Michael "One Last Cry" and talking to Dani on instant messenger....why should I go anywhere??....  So I'm headed BACK to Atlanta AGAIN this evening....sometimes I think I should have just spent the summer there....but the money I'm making is okay....  Man....life is becoming Grand Theft Auto for real....I couldn't believe what I read on  urlLink Beth's blog  this morning....dude was on a MISSION....that is some wild ish....  I am going to succumb to impulse buying very soon and get the digital camera that I have wanted for almost 3 years now....yep....I have a spending problem.....cuz this Banana Republic bill is staring me in the face and I'm going to pay the MINIMUM...(why do I like typing words in CAPS to MAKE A POINT....heh heh heh....I amuse myself)  Anyways the only thing I can think about is getting in a jacuzzi at some point this weekend....I worry about my future....

      Man.....there was a time when Death Row Records was THE label....I'm sitting here listening to Young Daz's verse on "Let's Play House"....they don't make music like this anymore....  Anyways I attended a beautiful wedding this weekend....my classmate Carmen married her longtime boyfriend Stephen.....they had a really nice reception at a place in Atlanta called Villa Christina....watching those two, truly in love ALMOST got me to change my mind about never getting married....almost....  I went clubbing on Saturday night in the ATL....I don't have to dance at all to have fun in the club....I like people watching....folks do the wildest stuff in the club as if they are in total isolation....I just grab a Hen and Coke in one hand and a Heineken in the other and post up....very rarely I will dance with some extra cute girl but I can't really dance so whatever....  Everyone seems to have an opinion on the BET awards....well I stayed far away from those beezos.....I really could care less about that mockery of my culture....but that's just me....I have been Cita/Hits free for going on 3 months now and I feel better way down in my soul....  I was supposed to go to New Orleans for the 4th....but instead I am going to spend the actual 4th with my dad (shoulda been the plan all along) and then go to Mom's family reunion in Greensboro, NC....the last time I had a great time....I'm looking forward to seeing old familiar faces....  They moved the NY party to a Friday evening, thereby making it impossible for me to go logistically....I still want to head up that way someday this summer....I am kind of hesitant to hang with my one friend up there cuz his girlfriend is possibly the craziest female I've ever met, so I'm gonna need this OTHER PERSON to still be there....that will be the deciding factor.....  Anyways that's enough blogging for now...gotta show my face a few places and pay a few bills....

      Just one thing before I start part two of my nightly slumber.....  the Mau Mau's song from Bamboozled, "Blak is Blak", might be THE hardest song ever....Mos Def, Canibus, MC Serch and the others absolutely RIP it....might be the most underrated song of the past 3 years....just my opinion....  Shouts out to my heroes Max aka Blac Thor and Smoove B.....and I'm out

      The 4th of July....spent the morning with my dad.....read him the story of Lita Sullivan's estranged husband's capture after his being on the run for 15 years (he alledgedly put a hit out on her)....the family ever vigilant.....Lita Sullivan went to school with my dad and his brother and sisters so it was a personal story for them....  I headed to Best Buy to buy the digital camera of my dreams only to find it not in stock....disappointment reigns....I got Vanilla Sky to ease my sorrow....I have yet to watch it....  My sister Nina and I then headed to a family friends house for dinner....lots of good food and interesting conversation....my mom's friend has two children who have both graduated from college....the younger attends Morehouse School of Medicine (going into her second year like me) and her oldest makes Blackhawk Helicopters....one thing I can say about when we all get together is that we always have interesting conversation....I think the biggest shocker was my very strong anti-marriage sentiments (they get stronger by the minute)....I just feel that this world is moving toward a place where marriage just has no place....I'll say more about this later if I feel so inclined....  Nina had passes to this "thing" (for lack of a better word/phrase on what to call it) at Evander Holyfield's crib....dude's land is just the most....I mean really....the MOST....Evander just has too much....his pool is bigger than my mom's house....hey...more power to him....I ran into this dude that is writing a book on my grandfather allegedly....sometimes I wonder about these "fate" meetings with people....like someone upstairs has a wonderfully sadistic sense of humor....  See the night before while having a talk with Beth, my balling-in-New York-buddy, my moms knocks on my door and tells me that my grandfather has been hospitalized with jaundice (yellow skin....among other things a sign of liver failure) so instead of going to the family reunion we are going to Mississippi....  Needless to say running into buddy made my stomach turn....this guy just wants to make some quick bucks to tell a story that means too much to me to see it go to waste....my grandfather deserves more....he spits some mumbo jumbo about how he wants my grandfather to live to see it published and aaaaaaaaalllll I have to do is help him get some amount of money from Dr. Walter Massey (Morehouse's president....like me and him are just old chums or something!!!) for some book he wrote way back when....  Anyway....so my mother and I head to Meridian, Mississippi (where my grandparents live) on Friday....as is our custom we ate at Cracker Barrel on the way....I made a bad choice with my breakfast but my hashbrown casserole was good....we arrive in Meridian and head straight to the hospital....my grandmother meets us in the hallway and tells us that it's the "worst possible news"....my grandfather has liver cancer....he's dying....  We don't know how long he will be here....I'm on standby mode as I type this because I know at any moment I might have to head back to Mississippi....the worst part was breaking the news to my father....he loves my grandfather....it's a long story but the short version is that my mother's father went to Morehouse with my dad's father....he pledged him.....and through some twist of fate (or God's work depending on your perspective) their daughter and son, respectively, met and fell in love....I am the result of that love....we lost my father's father (my namesake) in 1993....in that time I have gotten alot closer with my other grandfather....he held my hand the entire time I was in the room with him on Friday....  I feel right now like my world is coming apart....God is really showing me who is in control of things and there is nothing I can do about it other than pray....my friend Erica was telling me on the way back to Nashville how the Bible tells us to celebrate death and mourn birth....it makes sense but is easier said than done....Life is all I know....death is a great mystery....I KNOW that eventually everyone I love and even my own essence will be lost to me....how can I be comfortable in that....  Anyway I am making myself angry, sad, and confused....I'm through typing for tonight as this has turned into something I didn't want it to....

      As a couch potato I don't know if there is any feeling quite like seeing your favorite episode of a good TV show....especially if you haven't seen it in a while....  Last night I saw the episode of Martin when he and Bruh man got a job selling bootleg shirts at the Whitney Houston concert....the shirts said "Whitty Huton" and had a picture of Bruh Man with a wig....I laughed my black ass off....I still giggle about it....now all I need to see is the episode of Living Single when Kyle Barker gets a fish and names it after himself, then the fish eats all the other fish in the tank....for some reason I love that episode....  Today is the last day of one of my jobs....at least, the last day that students will be here....there is an awards ceremony today....I really hope all of them go on to have much success....  Well I think I need to get an early start....gotta send some bills off...

      Okay....so tonight for my classmate Val's birthday, we went to a little eat/play pool pub called Bailey's and then went to this place called the Bourbon Street Blues and Boogie....  Now I gotta tell you I wasn't so keen on the idea of Blues and Boogie, but man it was really fun!....I had a blast and the music was great....the guy who performed at first was just aight...but when the guy Michael Burke and his band arrived I was into it....He played some songs I recognized in a Bluesy/funky way (Hey Joe, Going to Kansas City, some non christmasy version of Please Come Home for Christmas)....fun was had by all involved....it was just a really good time....  On the way home I saw FOUR Nashville police cars around one car that apparently had committed some moving violation....and on Sunday at the Hooters on Harding Place I saw two cars pull one man over for not having a seatbelt....I ask is this city that lame that it takes that much manpower for such a minor violation??....not only that, they also have a tendency to block the entrance to places that are STILL OPEN.....such as the time I was at Kroger and a dude ran a red light and they blocked the entrance to give him a ticket....I swear this "big city" where they make the street lights blink at 11:30 has a waaaaaaaaaaay to go....

      Friday I drank entirely too much....we were making home made Long Islands.....needless to say the night ended with me calling an old freind (and it wasn't ole girl Joy who I used to mess with back in the day)....I knew I had gone too far when I started listening to Who You Wit by Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz and then dancing to it....  I say all of that to say that prior to this weekend a night like that would have taken me out of the game for at least two weeks....well Saturday night I drank again.....Houston we have a problem....Luckily for me Saturday night didn't end the same way....anyway next topic  There is something about being a student that causes you to turn every discussion into some sort of debate....  What's the best movie of all time?.....what's such and such's best movie?.....what's better Mad TV or SNL?....What movie had more memorable lines Friday or Coming To America?....on Saturday night all of these arguments were tossed back and forth and then some....I mean we got to the point where we were naming an actor/actress and people would name his or her best movie (in their opinion)....for the record I stated that Julia Roberts is the ONLY legitimate actress of her generation....upon further thought on the subject I feel that the actress in second (Marisa Tomei) isn't even close....there are just some bad actresses out there....what's the deal with that?  Anyway I found a good DVD player for 69 dollars so of course I know have one and a half DVD players in every (non-bath) room in my apartment (only having two rooms that adds up to three).....and I also caught The Royal Tenenbaums....I loved it....highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor that doesn't require a laugh track to know when to laugh....  Anyway's off to handle bizness

      First things first....  Dad's surgery was successful....it was eating me up being her in Nashville while it was going on....and I blew up my mom and two sisters cell phones trying to get updates....but he is doing fine.....he got re-trached and was super hungry but he had no complications....thanks for all of you who were concerned and kept us in your thoughts and prayers....hopefully this will be the end of this nightmare....  The program ended on Thursday....now I don't hate much in this world....but I DO hate public speaking....I sweat....I shake....I just don't like it....so imagine my disdain when I'm called up to speak to the students at the banquet....Now I must say I was killing them looks wise....I had on my favorite bow tie (I might have been dong THE MOST and been completely overdressed....but still I looked good....I got alot of compliments).....but I didn't quite know what to say....I got to speak last out of the three mentors that spoke....and I kept my words brief.....but I got a standing ovation.....I don't really know why....I didn't say much and I didn't say ANYTHING profound....but one of the students told me later that I was their favorite mentor because I "really cared about them when alot of people didn't"....I'm glad I could make them feel that way....  I went to see Austin Powers in Goldmember that night....I was expecting it to be packed....so much so that Geoff and I ordered 10 tickets on Fandango just to be CERTAIN that we had tickets....we had a group of eleven so you can imagine our fear in not being able to get everyone in....when we arrived there were 4 frigging people in the theater....it was like we had a private showing....anyway, the movie was great...to address the questions most asked about the movie (in no particular order):  Beyonce is not spectacular but she doesn't take anything away from the movie, and she looks better than Liz Hurley and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) combined....Mini-Me and Austin's Dad are the two best characters in this one.....Goldmember is funny as hell but one of those characters you really don't want to look at all of the time.....and well Fat Bastard is still very funny....the movie takes some twists and turns that you don't really expect but for the most part (with one big exception) all of the twists are good and very funny....much has been made in critic circles about the cameos, to me they were well placed and VERY funny....overall I say it is neck and neck with the second one in terms of overall quality and I give it an A-.....  Didn't do much outside of getting paid yesterday.....I picked up NCAA College Football 2003 and went to hooters for wings and beer...  I also talked with a classmate....I was getting ready to fuss at her about not hanging with us and not returning my calls when she told me her father had died....I felt so terrible.....it's yet another reminder of how short and fleeting life really is....she is such a sweet young woman and I hate to see her having to deal with such pain because she is so outgoing and lively, but she seems to be holding up well....  it's so hard to keep a good outlook when life keeps rolling you snake eyes....but I'mma keep playing till my last chip is down....  Anyway I'm 2 weeks overdue on a haircut....and I have clothes to wash....life doesn't stop....  (P.S. Beth....my application is in the mail...I've been waiting for a job opening like that....you know the economy is in bad shape....one thing though?....do I have to act like Puffy's guy??.....cuz I would have to withdraw my name....)

WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PLACE TO BE MASSAGED?  My neck....  8. STRONG IN MIND OR STRONG IN BODY  mind.  9. WHAT TIME DO YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING?

      Coping....  I realized (with some help....) that I have this big outlet for coping, yet rarely if ever do I address the real shit going on in my mind....  I am starting to think I am one of the more shallow people I know....no substance whatsoever....  Anyway here is a major dilemma....the surgery my dad was supposed to have about a month ago got rescheduled for tomorrow....I had no idea about this until last Thursday when I am talking with my Uncle who also happens to be the one taking care of my dad....  Said uncle has a way of making me feel terrible about things as far as dad is concerned....he fusses about the fact that my sisters and I work....he says that if it was his father he would be doing a whole lot more.....he just makes it seem like I'm doing everything but the right thing....  My friends, sisters, and Mom tell me that being in Nashville and doing the med school thing is what I need to be doing....but if that is the case why do I feel so guilty about what my uncle is saying....why do I feel that I need to be in Atlanta tomorrow for my dad's surgery?....what do I really fear?....do I only want to save face in my uncle's eyes?  I try to balance things out....my sisters had a very clear and concise argument as to why I shouldn't feel as much obligation as I do....I try to tell myself, "Hey, you are a 23 year old black male in medical school, when your uncle was your age, he was getting as high as a kite"....that only goes so far....because at the end of the day things are still the same....my dad wouldn't be here if not for my uncle....  But I have bigger things to worry about....my mother's father is dying as I type this....he is in a hospice in Mississippi....I know he would rather be home....all my granddad had in his life was his family and his dental practice....he served as a politician for awhile, but his loves were us and his practice....when he had a stroke a little more than a year ago, he was lost one of his loves....a man who, every single day for decades would go to his office and do something he loved was no longer able to....I can't imagine how terrible that must feel....and now what's left?  Meanwhile I am struggling here in Nashville....I find it amusing that people think I just coast through school....I don't....I haven't.....I won't go into greater details because I'm just a secretive person that way (see it's not just about friendship and loyalty....I don't like to open up about anything at all....)....but I'll just say that last semester was not a good performance academically....and I have some major issues to resolve this week or M.D. might become nothing more than a dream....  But yeah I gotta also worry about what my uncle has to say....I can't even tell the people I feel the strongest about how I feel....I don't really feel like I can talk to other people....I don't know exactly what it is, other than I feel I can't trust people....I'm insecure and I don't know how you fix insecurity....I sit back and I think to myself, how many people can I really trust....how many people have any idea how Calvin really feels at any given moment....and right now I can't say that anyone does....I tend to give more detail to a few select people....but even then I don't let my guard down....Nina and Che know a great deal....but not everything....I used to be able to talk to my dad....I love my mom but I can't talk to her about me....I have friends around here and other places that I talk to when certain issues come up.....but I make sure I dance around them as awkwardly as I can....in short I'm a hot mess....who would ever want to take on the terrible job of cleaning me up?

      This weekend I went up to Sandusky, Ohio.....  What the hell would you go to Sandusky, Ohio for you ask?....well there is an amusement park up there called Cedar Point....man, oh man....  We left around 1 AM Central time....we had a 9 hour trip ahead of us....I had never been to Kentucky or Ohio before so I was kinda excited just about seeing some new things....I wanted to see the stadiums in Cincinatti....unfortunately the highlight for the trip up for me was seeing an all night skateboarding park in Louisville....I was asleep most of the rest of the way....yes I wussed out....I would wake up and offer random bits of trivia or whatever to give the appearance that I wasn't asleep, but I fooled no one....Anyway we got to Toledo at about 9:30 Eastern time....Toledo was where we were supposed to catch some Ohio state freeway into Sandusky....well we missed our exit and ended up in Michigan for a few seconds (I'd never been there either)....we turned around, ate at Mickey D's (and pretended to leave the Drewski....funny stuff), and had to take the turnpike into Sandusky....  Cedar Point's claim to fame is having the biggest, highest, and scariest roller coasters in the world....as we arrived in Sandusky we pull up over this hill and all of a sudden we see the top of this roller coaster....all of us in the car (Geoff, Drew, Amanda, and I) start tripping....I was completely and totally shook....  So we arrive in the park and make a beeline to the Millinium Force (the one we saw from 5 miles away)....mind you the park has only been open for 17 minutes when we enter the gates....the line for this bad boy is already an hour and fifteen minutes.....the way the line is designed, the ride makes a turn right above/around you....the people seemed to be going at super sonic speeds....but the line is also designed to hide most of the ride from you (strategic trees, tents and awnings for shade, etc.)....so we had absolutely no idea what to expect....all you could tell was that the seats had almost no type of restraint mechanisms....talk about scary....as we approach the loading station we notice that the lift hill is not like typical lift hills....none of the slow click, clack, here-comes-your-doom type thing....it pretty much pulls you up at about twice the speed you normally go up....that was a good thing....if I had to go up that 310 foot steep hill that slowly, I surely wouldn't have rode it....so we get strapped in while they are playing some funky, new age music....and I turn and tell Geoff, "I have no idea why I let them strap me into this thing....what am I doing?"....by the time I was done saying that we were off.....the lift hill while fast, was very steep....I had a sense of impending doom....we reach the top of the hill and then head STRAIGHT DOWN....I mean the angle had to be something over 80 degrees....and we were going FAST....we had a couple of passes over big hills....some sharp turns....some tunnel action....all in all it was the best ride I've ever ridden....  We also rode the Raptor which is sorta like the Bat-Man at Six Flags....a looping ride with the track over your head....the newest ride in the park was a back and forth ride that takes you vertically while supposedly twisting you....the thing about it is, depending on where you sit you may only be twisted on one pass or another....or if you are in the middle you get twisted just a little bit but never enough....it kinda sucked....we went to T.G.I. Fridays and got a bite to eat as well as a few drinks and then took it to the hotel for a nap.....man that nap was just what we needed....we headed back out to the park at about 8....it was much cooler and the lines were shorter....we took out the Magnum XL-200 twice and two wooden roller coasters before heading back to the Millinium Force again....the second time was better....it seemed to go alot faster....  Overall I had alot of fun.....besides the sea-gulls (my arch enemies and a topic for another day) Cedar Point had no flaws....I will return!

      This is my life....I had no choice in the matter....  Never let anyone tell you that being a 23 year old black male, starting your second year in medical school equates to being a success....nope....not when "it's your responsibility to take care of your father"....when you feel pressure to give large sums of money to family members please follow through because when you don't "you are a liar and God hate's liars"....I wouldn't want to piss God off any further....I mean look at my life now....  Anyway yesterday I had my first class of my second year....I had heard all sorts of things about the professor of my behavioral sciences course....what i found out about her was she has a vocabulary that is off the HOOK....she used $20 words like she had a million dollar budget in her mind....of course I believe she doesn't have any synonyms for the word germaine (she used it at least 10 times in describing the course) but she can't be perfect I guess.....all in all I think I am going to enjoy this course....maybe it will help me figure out what is wrong with me and my family....  I gave serious thought to doing a sort of "Life Story of Cal" in five parts on this here site....but I'm going to hold off for now....I think I'm going to write a script instead....see where that takes my mind....how exactly does a medical student find the time to write a script?.....that's part of the fun I do believe.....  No class today....so I'm turning today into Movie day....it seems that in my latest DVD purchasing binge I have forgotten to watch most of them (imagine that....buying 10 DVD's in 2 weeks and not watching ANY of them)....I watched Primal Fear this morning....pretty good movie.....not great.....but I was satisfied....Magnolia is on now.....I'm letting it reach the point where I left it on during my last attempt....I will also be giving Vanilla Sky a THIRD audition as I have fallen asleep the past two attempts to watch it....from that point i will play it by ear, although I feel compelled to watch Braveheart, given all of the criticism I've taken for having not ever seen it....  Yep....this is the life I live....

Today was registration day for second year of med school....I wasn't really looking forward to today but seeing my old classmates was actually pretty cool....I was doing some silly flirtation...I think I might have actually missed a couple of them....oh well.....lets see if I feel the same way after the first block....  So as of late I have been talking to a rather interesting young lady....she's real cool....we'll see where it goes....  Not much else to say right now....gotta read some Behavioral Sciences stuff (I'm also taking Biochemistry this semester and some more physical diagnosis)....

      I'm back here again?....how did I get here?....I meant to go to Blackplanet chat at 8 in the morning....  Oh well.....so the Rhodes furniture people call me at too early o'clock to tell me that they will be delivering my table this morning....so I got up and did what I shoulda done Saturday and vacuumed the floor....now all I can think about is "what if my table is too big for my lil ass apartment....what will I do!!......I think I'm just being paranoid though.....  The new freshmen have their White Coat Ceremony today....it reminds me of how we got shafted last year....every other class here at Meharry has had embroidered coats with the Meharry seal on the left side....our class got plain white coats with a damned cheap ass name tag and a pin....I know it's petty but hell I'm a petty dude....these suckas bet not have embroidered coats or I'mma kick up some sand....  I'm going to upload all the wonderful pictures I took/will take today sometime this weekend so you all (all 10 of you) can see the beautiful people (and I mean that quite literally) that I go to school with....med school has some great looking women!  More to say later!

      I bought the digital camera I've been wanting all summer on Saturday....oh joy!  Saturday I also bought a much needed table for my apartment and two directors chairs....then I went to a party thrown by one of my classmates....I was supposed to provide the music....instead I brought one decent CD and one TERRIBLE cd....I was too drunk/high to care though....  So anyway last night I go see Martin Lawrence's latest....Runteldat......very, very funny....but what interested me more was the segment at the beginning detailing some of the things he had been through up to that point and his assessment of the media coverage.....I realized that he made several good points about the media's tendency to micro examine the things we do in our daily lives....I guess the price of fame is peace of mind though....glad I'm not famous....  I will never, ever figure out women....in my on going pursuit of this young lady I find myself recently pissing her off with my actions....I admit I do some stupid things but damn I don't really have the patience to try and coax you out of your desire to not want to speak anymore....I have got enough stress in my life....I'm starting to think it's just not for me to even date, let alone get married.....all the verbal and mental sparring....I just don't have the energy for it....life is too big for all that!....and then for what?....so I can have the exclusive right to look at you for the majority of the rest of the days of my life.....ughh.....  Sometimes I wonder what the hell it's all for.....

      So where was I?....ahh yes....the white coat ceremony was lovely....I got alot of nice pictures and then decided to take some pictures of my classmates as well....I have such a great class....then I went to my classmate who had the party the other night's house and a few of us drank margaritas and shot the shit....there was supposed to be a barbeque at the ampitheater at Meharry....and I suppose it was....but it was kind of dissappointing....I called it a night but didn't sleep well...  Saturday I spent mostly transferring pictures from my camera to this computer here....I really got some great pictures....halfway through my boy Nile signed on and I sent him a few.....the pictures convinced him that he should head back up to Nashville sometime soon for a repeat of earlier this year....sounds good to me....then I headed out to a picnic at Centenial Park....it was an Alpha picnic, directly in front of Nashville's replica of the Parthenon (I found this to be very appropriate for some reason)....I had fun at the picnic and also had alot to drink....in a drunken rage I found myself blurting out the address to this site so my traffic should increase for a few days until they find out how boring I really am and see that I don't update all that often....maybe they'll start blogs of their own or become a Kel/OJ/Daana/Dani (if she ever comes back!)/Beth junkie like I am....  Anyway after the picnic we headed to Friday's to grab something to eat....our service was terrible, but the food was good....that's how it seems to go at Friday's on Elliston Place....the bright spot was me winning the trivia contest....I had to fight off this woman with a gold outfit and a matching gold hat....turns out she was like the point's leader at that particular location....I impressed her with my trivia knowledge....I was winning the next contest pretty solidly but my party was ready to head out....I had gotten the full amount of points on the first 5 questions and I looked like I was going to run away with it....but I ended up in 2nd place by the seventh question....the table in front of me was gunning for me and they were dissappointed with me leaving....I probably could have come back and won....but oh well....we'll never know...MAYBE I CAN CONVINCE ONE OF MY READERS TO GO BACK AND DO SOME TRIVIA WITH ME BEFORE SHE HEADS BACK TO ATLANTA (how is that for being subtle)....  I woke up this morning and Forrest Gump was on....I got a pleasant phone call, but it was at a crucial point in the movie....I have a confession....Forrest Gump now makes me cry several times during the course of the movie....then I was inspired to call my mother....she gave me some great words of wisdom as she is prone to do lately....and she helped me to see certain things in my life in a new light....we talked about quite a few things....I'm really blessed....I love my mother....  Don't know what I'm GOING to do today....I NEED to clean up but there is a fat chance of that happening....

      I been away awhile eh?....well if you read  urlLink Che's stuff   you know that my maternal Grandfather passed away on Wednesday morning....  Well I don't want to dwell on the bad stuff so I'll give some highlights....I saw my cousin Bryan for the first time in a while.....we kicked it hard....went to the mall where he hit on every girl with a pulse and some redeeming quality....we went to Applebee's and knocked back a few drinks....and we went to the casino where we got cleaned out on the Blackjack tables....we almost got run off the table for awhile before the guy next to me intervened and started giving me some tips....I was up $200 at one point and probably should have left well enough alone....but I had to get greedy....I left 100 in the hole....  I flew on a propeller plane in the legs of my trip between Atlanta and Nashville....man...talk about scary....and it's small too....I'm glad i'm noat claustraphobic or I would have gone crazy....  Speaking of planes....I feel compelled to speak on Delta's monopoly of southeastern flights....it makes no sense that a flight to Meridian (with a layover in Atlanta) costs less than a direct flight to Atlanta....yet because Delta has exclusive rights to that route they can charge me and anyone else flying that route an arm and a leg....it's just not right I tell ya....  I think things will work out so much better for my aunt and her kids with them in Mississippi with my Grandmother....it lessens some of the tension that was so strong and still growing with them living in my mother's house....maybe it was the circumstances, but our family hasn't been nearly as amicable in YEARS....funny how death can do that....  My family was loving the digital camera....Sony should give me a commission because I think I virtually sold 3 of their cameras to various people over the weekend....  Anyway another long week is coming....gotta hit the hay.....

      Lately it seems that my random rantings have taken a backseat to other things in my life....  School is going well...been taking more pictures than the law should allow....and well I'm enjoying where my young lady friend is taking me (most of the time)....  In short, although Death paid me a visit in the past month, Life hasn't treated me this well in a long time....  On another note....in my time at Morehouse I met some interesting people....however perhaps no one was more interesting than  urlLink the homie Faraji ....Raj has entered the wonderful world of blogging....Raj is one of the three best writers I know (now if we could just get Joe from Dallas to start blogging)....keep an eye on his life of "swarth and excess"....  That reminds me of the good old days....when words like swarthyness, coonery, debauchery, and stunnage were fixtures in my very unscholarly vocabulary....I really can't wait for Homecoming so I can be reminded of the memories created in Atlanta as a college student....the days of being a psuedo-celeb (if Raj was a third tier celeb I guess I must have been on the fifth or sixth tier) and balling on a budget....the days when we created a VIP list and there were no such things as delusions of granduer....  Anyway....for the sake of my obsession with smelling good all of the time it is time to overpay to wash and dry my clothes....later for this site

      Man....what can I say  Okay I did well on my tests....first block can be deemed a success officially....  The homie Geoff is the social coordinator for the class and thusly I usually make the flyers and what not for events....so yesterday we are supposed to have an event at The Sports Cafe on the Water at Metrocenter....Geoff had gone up there the day before to make final arrangements and give them some expected numbers....the usuals....  Why do we arrive and the Sports Cafe is CLOSED???....not closed for the day see you tomorrow....closed for a while, paper on the door, big signs closed....man we were salty....we went through a series of calling people to notify them of the cancellation of event and what not....and end up where everyone in Nashville ends up....Chili's....but it sucks that I worked my creative juices hard for nothing....  Anyway three of my closest Nashville friends were born on Sept. 6th so they are having a big party tomorrow....I am supposed to be making the punch....the last batch of punch I made was a rousing success....so we'll see this time....  Time to make a celebratory round of drinks and play some Madden....

      The neglect of this site is a crime....I'm sorry....I'm sorry....I guess having no form of commenting fools me into believing that no one reads this rag at all....but I know someone is reading it.....right????......right????  Anyway what happened last week?....nothing of interest really....  I was voted in as the historian for Meharry's chapter of the Student National Medical Association because of my obsession lately with taking digital pictures with my digital camera.....I have been charged with making a website for said organization even though I can't get my own domain that I STILL pay for off the ground....I suck for that....at any rate look for BOTH relatively soon....  I learned this week that talking mess in Black Planet is not the wisest thing to do if you don't like real life confrontation....  On a related note I amaze myself at times in my ability to totally flip the script and be the monkey ass nigga that the intelligent side of me hates....I mean sometimes I just do the most ignorant things just for the sake of doing them....as if all of the repressed badboyisms of my youth come out in forms I deem as safe....escapism is a mutha....  I have tests tomorrow and wednesday in all of my courses.....have I studied?....actually yes.....have I studied ENOUGH?....no not quite  I talked to my dad this morning....it seems like everyday he makes strides in one capacity or another....I'm so glad I get to talk to him everyday without worry of someone placing the heavy (and undeserved) burden of guilt on my shoulders....  In other news I have been reading the novel Hannibal again....it is a better, albeit slower, read the second time around....I picked up on some things I never noticed the first time around....  O.J. and Syl went to Atlanta this weekend and I was a de facto tour guide/Atlanta opinion guy for them.....despite the fact that I was all the way in Nashville....I am sure that they will have plenty to say on their respective websites about their trip....I will say that my great city has managed to both excite and dissappoint me as I had a chance to vicariously see Atlanta from an outsiders unbiased perspective for the first time as an adult.....(that was a busy statement....I'm not quite sure it made sense)  Anyway, what has been put off for weeks (washing my clothes and studying) must be done or I will have dire consequences (I will be a stinky man with failing grades)....I PROMISE to update more frequently this week....for real....and as a bonus I will find someone to host my comments!  Bye!

      Well....let's see....I had taken the time earlier today and written some thoughts on classroom etiquette....but the sentimental creature I am, combined with the media bombardment of 9/11 imagery have given me a desire to recount my life on this day last year....  My day started the same as any other, and I imagine any other for the people who were affected by the days events....Death isn't like one of your boys....you never get any warning or sign that the day is any different....  Anyway I was down in the Gross Anatomy lab doing some work on my dear old first, fat body, affectionately known as "Addy" (for her large amount of adipose tissue...gotta love medical humor!)....we had just started the head/neck block and I was dissecting the circle of willis (some of my finest Gross work by the way!)....at any rate Dr. Jackson enters the room and very matter of factly says, "My wife just called saying some plane crashed into the World Trade Center.".....me, Dr. Jackson, and two classmates (Eric and Spence) speculate for a minute and eventually come to the conclusino that some idiot had lost control of his Cesna.....I guess in hindsight it shows how inexplicable the days events were to us at the time....assuming it was some rich person's folly....  About 10 minutes before class started I decided to go to the lounge and check on my food in the freezer (we were having a rash of food thefts and I had a particularly good lunch in there that day although I don't recall what it was now)....well the lounge was PACKED....and some people were in tears....as I got in closer to the TV, I was just in time to see the second plane crash into the building....I went into the classroom to tell Dr. Jackson what had happened....somehow we still managed to get about 30 minutes of class in before the news of the pentagon crash and the threat of another plane going down (I think someone had mentioned Camp David, where we thought Pres. Bush was)....at this point many of my classmates were in various states of panic....people were calling home, checking on family and friends....  I remember a few distinct thoughts....My mom, dad, and sisters came to mind....our house is near the Atlanta Airport and I remember thinking very logically that hijackers with bad aim could take our house very easily if Hartsfield was one of the points of attack....I thought of my classmates who worked in New York....Caishe, Darrell, Trey, Fza, Joe's brother Jordan, even the former Miss Maroon and White Naila....I saw a few of my classmates with family in New York and Washington in tears and wondered if they had lost anyone....  The next few hours were a blur as I fluctuated from disbelief to anger to grief to exaspiration....I remember thinking how happy I was to find out (relatively quickly) that my limited NY connections were all safe...and even second degree contacts were all alive and well....I remember thinking to myself, "My grandmother has just passed....we don't need anything else like this" (I laugh at that thought given everything that has taken place since then)....  I remember that Me and Crystal were in the midst of a lightweight beef and weren't really speaking....we've been on good terms ever since....that brought alot of things into perspective for the both of us....when I got home I was so happy to see one of my best friends in the world....I made sure all of her people were okay....I told her all of mine were okay.....then she decided that we should go to the store and to the gas station....apparently her mother had warned her that in Texas they were raising gas prices (as much as 10 dollars I believe)....we got to the gas station and I swear I had never seen a scene like that, everyone was filling up....the prices had indeed gone up a few cents (we later found out that price gouging was illegal and would never happen like that....not when they can very slowly nickel and dime us to death as they do now).....we went to the store and stocked up non-perishables....we were eating canned green beans until the day we moved....  Well the world is almost back to normal now...people still hate each other now almost as much as they did then (except they hate muslims more).....I wonder what the world needs next....  Till later

      The games this weekend....ahhhhh...gotta love football.....  So who looks strong?  Right now everyone to be honest....well The Ravens looked terrible and the Steelers looked subpar....and well the Bengals apparently are still the Bengals....  Today I want to talk about the person sitting directly next to me in the computer lab....Miss J. A.....she has started what we haved decided to call "football lessons"....in her purse as we speak she has a cheat sheet telling her all of the positions at any given time....she sat down this weekend and watched the NFL Sunday Ticket at the homie Dave's crib....  This is commendable on so many levels....more women should do this....by the end of the year J.A. will be able to discuss football on an intermediate level which immediately thrusts her into the upper echelon of women in America....along with my favorite lady right now and the venerable Charlie Cole (also known as the "Black Something about Mary")....  Anyway.....who is winning the super bowl you ask?....well I made a prediction on  urlLink OJ's message board in the Sports section (the thread entitled 'The NBA is cool but umm.....'   I'm not sure I want to make another prediction this soon....but for now I would like to say that Michael Vick has elevated his status in my eyes....and I already held him in high esteem....the man WILL be a Hall of Famer barring injury....  coming tomorrow some type of acknowledgement of Sept. 11....

      I am a terrible friend....  Last night I got a call from my girl Tiffany (one of the 9 or so Tiffany's I know).....she called me and asked me what today's date was....I knew right away what the problem was....I forgot yet another birthday....  I am too lazy to get my PDA fixed....and even then I probably wouldn't use it....but I need to find a way to remember birthdays....unless i get a daily reminder leading up to it I'm going to forget....that's pretty much a given with me if your name isn't Nina, Che, Pat or C. Miles....at any rate I feel terrible....  So to Eulus (I forgot his birthday last year....my oldest and best friend....if I forgot his, I don't think anyone is vulnerable), Tiffany, Beth, hell the list is too long....I'm sorry....I owe alot of dinners man....  Ugh....anyway I didn't do as well on my Biochem test as I thought I did (although I still passed with little problem).....anyway that shows me I need to buckle down and get for real....  Time to read a little and get ready for Monday Night Football....tomorrow will be a run down on the NFL....

      First of all...I must laugh for about 3.5 seconds at the bookbag Blogger is attempting to have it's users sport....wow....  Okay....so having read  urlLink Raj's latest tale of Swarth  I have officially placed him in the Hall of Fame with imaginary characters such as Shaft and Tyler Durden....  Okay so I have tests coming up on Monday and Tuesday....Round 2 might go to Atta and company as I haven't devoted myself as thoroughly as I needed to....but this has been a fun filled block....one of those blocks that will happen when you learn more outside the classroom than in it....  I need to update my links....as all of my inactive friends are now once again active....hello to the approximately 4 people who take the time to read this rag....the days of blogspot are drawing to a close.....Killacal.net is closer than you think....  In the mean while read some of my old stuff to keep you entertained....

      My life, my life, my life.....in the sunshine....  Today I bought two more volumes of Neil Gaiman's  Sandman  series (Volume IV  Seasons of Mist  and Volume IX  The Kindly Ones .....I already had  Preludes and Nocturnes , volume I) as well as the other  Death  mini series (I already had  The High Cost of Living ....the one I bought today was  The Time of Your Life ).....I also bought True Romance and an issue of Stuff (the best to date....I am about to subscribe)....  Back to Neil Gaiman's work....I am so angry with myself for not getting into it earlier....back in high school I used to buy comic books from my friend Carmen's brother Andy....and he would always try to get me into Sandman but I was too much into X-Men....my mistake....the incorporation of mythology and literature into comics is amazing to me....I can't wait to read the rest of the series....  Ugh....relationships....I wrestled with whether to bother to put anything at all about last nights events here considering my readership (or the fact that the person concerned here reads this....by the way how messed up is if for you to read my stuff and not give me the address for your stuff?)....anyway....I don't wanna fight no more....I'm spent....I'm punch drunk....I'm dazed.....like BP's favorite Deceased Princess and subject of many a female homoerotic crush (it warrents mentioning that most of these females hated her when she was alive....how shady is that?) Aaliyah sang, "we need a resolution"....anyway I'll leave it at that....

      I woke up this morning.....got myself a gun....  Right...so i'm about 3 seasons too late into my Soprano's kick, but I just officially started with Season 1....I love it man....every bit of it...I'm mad I missed the premiere of Season 4 last night  The Raiders-Steelers game was excellent though....the Steelers look BAD so far....and I for one couldn't be happier....  My Falcons....ahhhh...my Falcons....three turnovers in a row???...that score should have been so much worse....so credit is due to the defense....but as I was saying on soulcity....we need recievers!!!....  I've heard good things about "Barbershop"....frankily I didn't care if all of the critics and all of my people bombed it though....I am still going to see it....it passes the initial tests for me...and that's all that matters...maybe I'll convince someone to take me to see it some day this week....  well....I had more to say...but I'm not gonna say it now....so......peace

      Maybe I'm a misanthorpe....I'm willing to accept that fact....why do i say this?.....well last night our class had a "gathering"....about 15 people showed up so I don't know if you can really call it a gathering....  Well anyway....the only people I talked to were J.A., Dave, and the folks I came with....I just don't like those folks man...I can't get into them....the ones who were there coulda cared less about me anyway....so it didn't make me any difference....there was a time where I woulda at least liked to have taken pictures of them....but last night I didn't even care about THAT....and I'm COOL with that...ugh...anyway....  So today was a pretty cool day....went to PD and learned about the HENT exams (Head, ears, nose, and throat)....then I went to lunch with J.A., TaTa, Doris, and Dave....we had some pretty good conversation about male/female relations, why having a son is better than having a daughter, and other things....best lunch I've had in a while....  I went to Turtles and got what up until Tuesday was the BEST MOVIE NOT ON DVD....yes people.....Boomerang is out on DVD....don't all rush to Suncoast/Best Buy/wherever you buy your DVDs at once....I also got the special edition of True Romance which means I have yet another DVD to sell to the used DVD place....I also bought Cree Summer which I am listening to right now.....Curious White Boy is the jam easily....  Anyway....J.A. told me she stayed online for a few hours and read ALL of my posts....I was in awe with that fact although I don't think I really reacted as strongly as I felt....I feel I lead a really boring life and I can't imagine how anyone could stand to read all of this mess....anyway I digress  Somehow on the ride home she and I began to discuss the appropriateness of an 80's party....think about it, 3 years ago the idea of an 80's party would be silly....but people born in the 80's are becoming adults now....nostalgia is setting in....look at the 80's revival in fashion and pop culture....before you know it Hair Bands and Leg Warmers will be back....Diadoras and BK's are already back....Leather Jackets with zippers wouldn't surprise me....  Anyway....J.A. pointed out to me that in the 90's the rage was 70's nostalgia.....in the 80's it was the 50's and 60's....call me slow for just catching on....but I don't think it will be too far fetched to see a 90's revival in 2010....and I'm here to tell you I will be in full Neon, Cross Colours, Saved by the Bell effect then!!.....  Which brings me to another point....in the car we heard "Turn This Mutha Out" by "then MC" Hammer, and he used the phrase, "in effect"....Al B. Sure (who Geoff and I concluded WAS in fact the gayest man alive in 1987) had an album entitled  In Effect Mode ....someone who is hipper to the 80's slang needs to let me know EXACTLY what "In Effect" meant and where it was derived from....  Anyway I'm going to watch Marcus Graham do some fooling....peace

      Friendship is a funny thing....  Sometimes you can remember how they start....and sometimes you can't....  My earliest memory of my boy Eulus was going over his house for a sleepover (I know that's not the term reserved for little boys but "overnight party" sounds hokey)....anyway, we played footbal in his yard for a while and then watched movies....Karate Kid was the feature that night....  I remember that Eulus was in my second grade class, but he got into the Fulton County Majority to Minority program and transferred to Heards Ferry....  Well somehow or another we ended up ALWAYS over one another's houses....spending whole weekends....we would start off just going over to play some video games....or going to some movie....then somehow the whole weekend would be gone....and it would be time to go to school the next day....sometimes I left straight from his house to go to school....we were both the smartest people we knew....we would debate and debates would turn into arguments....we would fight all the time....we would also play contra and bionic commando and tecmo bowl....he was my best friend....  We started middle school and I was at Camp Creek and he was at the middle school de jour for Fulton County, Ridgeview....at that time my friend Nile was also one of my best friends and I remember a moment that played out like a bad 80's sitcom....you know when a person has 2 best friends and they meet and fight each other....well that happened with me....Nile was outspoken....and Eulus was no punk.....so they used to disagree all of the time....they probably don't remember that....anyway I had a Super Bowl party in 7th grade and those two of course were beefing....and it turned somehow into me and Eulus beefing....I don't remember much else about those times but I know we were going in different directions for a while....  High School started and once again we were at different schools....it's funny because when I was in middle school all I could talk about was going to Mays High and I ended up at Westlake....well Eulus went to Mays....if you know anything about Atlanta, you know that as far as elite black high schools go, there is Mays, and maybe Douglass (I hope the Drewski doesn't read this) and then everyone else....Well we each did our things at our respective places....both of us doing fairly well, towards the end of our high school journeys we started to kick it more....he had a car so he was able to get around....  Anyways one day we were discussing college on the phone....I was on the fast track to Xavier, and I had also just visited Howard University, which I liked alot....he was headed to Tuskegee to be a Vet....he always loved dogs....both of our fathers had gone to Morehouse.....but for some reason we never really thought much about doing it....we had gotten the same SAT score (I believe)....and briefly we discussed the fact that both of us had recieved full scholarship offers to Morehouse....so somehow it ended up that by the time it was all said and done we both not only ended up at Morehouse, but also both started summer programs on the same day....  Freshman year he stayed in Graves Hall, which is the honors dorm at Morehouse....I stayed in Dubois with my boy Nile (who also ended up at Morehouse through happenstance)....we went on a road trip to Howard for their homecoming (they crushed Morehouse 55-3 or something...but we didn't even go to the game)....we also hit up a med school tour with the Health Careers club that took us BACK up to D.C.....as the year progressed we kicked it more and more....we decided to room together Sophomore year....  Sophomore year could be a whole post by itself....some of the highlights were homecoming, the Holyfield fight/the night our room flooded, the yelling across the way at Will and Phil, the adventures with Seante`, the many drinking sessions at B.J. and Fza's, the time I went to Miami and missed the wildest Eulus related Morehouse moments, and on and on....we had alot of fun....and I know I was a bad roommate, but he put up with me better than anyone else has....  Junior year he went to Stanford for Spring semester and that was rough for me....in alot of ways I kind of "found myself" during that time, but it was odd without my best friend....the nigga that knew me best and could probably help me see my way through alot of the stuff that was going on....senior year, we kicked it more than the law should have allowed....we had some rough patches in there, but it's all been worthwhile  As we have grown into adults Eulus has always been one of two people that I KNOW without a doubt I can count on for ANYTHING....when my pops was sick he was the first person there for me, as a matter of fact I was at his house when I got the phone call about my dad....I know I can count on getting a call from Eulus once a week....his family is my family and my family is his family....he is the brother I never had.....  Well my nigga Eulus is turning 23 today....he is persuing an advanced degree at University of Maryland-College Park (go for the Ph.D nigga!!!)....that's my nigga for life and I wish I could be up there celebrating with him....do the damn thing homie!!....don't party too hard!

      Interesting weekend....  The beautiful homie Gayle and some of her friends were nice enough to let me roll down to the ATL with them....the ride was smooth....I was privy to some girl talk which is always funny at the least....and all the ladies were beautiful so that always helps....they were staying at the Doubletree on Cobb Parkway and I've obviously slept on this place for a while....the interior is like a French Quarter style veranda deal....ballingest to the extreme...they had a jacuzzi style tub, which is all you need for the Killa to be happy....I would never leave the room....  Anyway Gayle dropped me off at the crib and I walk in and see my pops who wasn't expecting me...it was great....he's looking real good....and walking around and what not...we talked for awhile...I showed he and my mom some pictures that I had taken....Nina came home and she took me to Popeyes cuz her brother was hungry....caught up with my nigga Rashard and I got up to date on all the Westlake (my high school alma mater) news....then the homie Nile came by and we decided to see what Buckhead had to offer....  I went to the Metropolitan Pizza Bar and my cousin's boyfriend Lou saw me from outside and came and holla'd at me....then my homies Ray G'z, Will, and Larkins popped up....it was great seeing the three of them....those were three of my closest friends at Morehouse and I was glad to see that all was going well....Nile decided to dance with this big rutish looking white girl who it turns out was a power forward for Wisconsin's Women's B-Ball team....I laughed at that fool....but we had alot of fun....  Saturday morning I was up kinda early...got two slices of bacon and headed to my bank which happens to be in the middle of Publix on Cascade road....inevitably I run into someone I know....this time it was a family that my family is really cool with....the husband works for a local radio station and helps with Morehouse's homecoming yearly, being the good alum that he is....the wife is from a city near my mom's hometown and used to date my uncle waaaaay back in the day....they have two little girls that convinced  urlLink my little sister Che  to give up babysitting as a money making venture....  Then me and my dad went to the Morehouse football game....I saw some good old faces (Coach Nix, John Kelley, Officer Davidson, John Terrell, Cool ass Beth, etc.)....but the highlight was easily the people sitting about 3 feet from me....now understand I don't jock any type of movie star....but I have to say it was wild sitting next to Denzel Washington (who's son had a good day rushing the football for the victorious Maroon Tigers, 24-17, in a sloppy contest against Bowie State) and someone who I never really figured was that cool with Denzel, Mr. Wesley "Blade" Snipes....yes Shadow and Bleek were kicking it at the Morehouse game....and yes Bobby (as in Bobby Digital my digital camera) captured it all....I also got lots of pictures of the cheerleaders....rekindling my love/hate relationship with the Maroon Tiger Cheerleaders (All love right now)....  Me and pops went to the tent where his homies hang out....they all made him feel pretty special and whatnot....I think it was a good experience for him....we had a few beers and some good food....and all in all had fun....I came home....caught a nap and then the homie Rashard came by....we went to Nile's and hooked up with him, Maurice, and Playboy Reg....I'll post about the dynamics of all of that later on this week....as we were leaving we got up with the homie Cauthen and hit the liquor store....then headed to the lovely Nicole's house....  Nicole had pizza for us and we all kicked back and chilled and laughed about old times....it was great....even though we were teased by an expected, but unfulfilled visit by our friends Tiffany and the lovely, elusive LaToya.....man Latoya is on a short list with Elenda and about 2 other girls from Westlake I'd like to "run into" and catch up on old times with....anyway.....I flirted hard with Nicole....she knows I have a crush on her....she's got it going on....and she's a homeowner now too!.....oh...just give me a chance!!!  Anyway....we went to a homie of Nile's birthday party....there were alot of people there...unfortunately they all knew each other and I knew none of them....that's not my kinda thing....so I bounced....  All in all it was a great weekend....back to the Nashville grind tomorrow....I leave out at 6 in the morning....and that is 4 hours from now....better get some sleep....

      Okay, call me a hater....but I am tired of the same five black actors de jour being in every psuedo-romantic buppie movie....if I get asked one more time about wanting to see   Brown Sugar   I'm going to kill someone....I have taken to calling it   The Best Wood and Basketball Jones   because it is basically the same movie concept that has been rehashed over and over.....some young urban professional falls in love with some other urban professional....there may be a childhood flashback although it is not manditory....and everyone lives happily ever after although there may be a fight amongst the friends for some terrible action that occured in the past....and don't forget the Black studly mandingo brother so that Black Women (who apparently only really require that one aspect and not really a story as evidenced by the box office take for   The Brothers     and  Two Can Play That Game , two of the most terrible movies ever) will be in attendance....anyway I say all that to say I'm not going to see Brown Sugar...  So I was watching MTV Jams while eating some Turkey Spaghetti yesterday (I cook for myself, yay!....I'm half a functional adult!!) and it appears that Master P has for some unknown reason has decided to REMAKE BOUT IT, BOUT IT....now a bit of trivia for those who maybe didn't know...the version of Bout it, Bout it that came out in 1996 was Part II, making this new version with "The Diplomats" (I am tempted to make an immunity joke....I'm so corny... I know) unofficially part III....but anyways I can't  really get mad about it or say that I am surprised....I mean we are talking about Master P here....ugh....  Anyway that's enough non-studying...time to hit the books hard for a few hours....

      Okay I have updated my links again....  I re-added  urlLink Beth  and I have found the funniest people on the internet (yes funnier than the onion and OJ....although it might not be as funny as OJ's message board)....anyway Resha, Vic, Carmen, et al. write at  urlLink Kthxbi  (old AOL terminology for Ok thanks, bye....by far the worst internet slang term ever....worse than the misuse of LOL and LMAO)....check them out....very, very funny....if you don't laugh at SOMETHING there you might be legally retarded (which makes me wonder about the readership I attract)....

      It's almost test time....again....the lives we choose to live....I tell ya....  Anyway I was thinking about the different friends and associates I have, and I am really lucky....I am almost always surrounded by positive people with alot to offer society....  I have within my close circle of friends:   several excellent, pulitzer caliber writers....gifted web designers....experts on dealing with people on personal levels....people on the fast track to business success....people with compassion rarely seen in the 2002 human being....people with gifted comedic talents....  My friends are some of the most thoughtful, thought-provoking, awe-inspiring people on the planet....  I have friends who have given me their last quarters without question....driven completely out of the way to make sure that I was a part of the action....made room for me when there was no room....broken the rules to get me into places....been an ear to listen to my often frivalous complaints....dealt with my assholish tendencies....dealt with people they couldn't stand because they were cool with me.....brought me food when I was hungry....taken me in when I had no place to go in a new city....  My friends have accepted me for who I am.....sometimes selfish, sometimes giving....sometimes joyful, sometimes melancholy....I have more mood swings than a heterosexual 23 year old Black man should....and I lash out at the people I love the most at times....and yet my friends are still there for me....  I don't know why I've been on this friendship kick so much lately....most of them won't even get a chance to read this...but I want my friends to know that my lack of vocalization doesn't translate to a lack of appreciation....  Thank God for friends....

      Has anyone heard the new Jay-Z and Beyonce song???....it's a blatent line for line rip of 2Pac's song Me and My Girlfriend....this is unbelievable to me!!....whatever happened to creativity in music?....and to think this time last year I was defending Jigga as the best artist....I feel ashamed for ever saying that....and then I hear that Toni Braxton had collaborated with Murder, Inc to come out with a remake of Me and My Girlfirend and is mad that Jay Z and Beyonce are "messing with her money"??....and they wonder why we download music for free on the internet??....why should we pay for a stale rehash of someone elses material???  Ughhh...the Braves are gone from yet another postseason without a World Series ring....this looks like the end of the road for the great Braves teams as either Maddux or Glavine (and maybe both) could leave via free-agency....it was fun while it lasted....and even though we only have one ring to show for it, I couldn't be prouder to be a Braves fan!....anyone who has something negative to say is jealous pure and simple (except Yankees or Blue Jays fans)....  Well it's time to go be productive....

      I should have posted something a while back....I've been a busy boy....  Let's see....what are the highlights?  In no particular order (I rather like randomness)....I saw Red Dragon on Friday night....it was everything I expected and more....I put a review over at urlLink  OJ's Message board  in the "Give a review of movies you just rented/watched"....for once I wasn't let down by a movie that I had high expectations for.....  I went to a party Saturday night at this Greek house at Vandy....I saw the gorgeous Jylana, who informed me that she occassionally reads the mess I type here....I felt pretty special....I must admit I kind of dig it when I find out that someone I completely don't expect to have taken notice of this website tells me that they know about it....  Said party was pretty cool....I was slightly intoxicated, but no worse for wear....Vandy has this house that apparently the Alphas, Omegas, and Sigmas share....I have heard various rumors about how they got the house....the one I will choose to propogate is the one that was told to me by young Ja'Nera (who I saw at the party)....allegedly the frat that used to own the house was suspended and forceed to give it over to the Black frats because they were taping "bumfights"....I had no idea people in Nashville were doing the bumfight thing....my boy Corey sent me a link to Bumfights about 6 months ago....who woulda known the fall out from that would be so far reaching?.....ahhh well...  Every week I make promises that I break....cleaning up my room, typing more frequently here, going to class every session....let's see how I do this week....

      Okay, I'm switching things up around here.  First things first, I think Max Kellerman was probably smart enough to copywrite the name of my old College Newspaper column (Around the Horn) so for now I don't have any snazzy title for this little project.  Today was a big sports day for a day with no major games to speak of.  The Pro Bowl rosters were announced today.  As is usually the case I have some issues with some of the players chosen/snubbed.   urlLink Here  you'll find the complete Pro Bowl Rosters.  First things first, Jeremy Shockey's inclusion.  What the hell is the deal with that?  I know that the NFC doesn't have too many standout Tight Ends, but the man played half a season.  Boo Williams of the New Orleans Saints would have been a much better choice.  Itula Mili put up some decent numbers for the Seattle Seahawks as well.  Some pundits (PTI and Around The Horn participants) took exception to the two top teams in each conference by record (Philadelphia and New England) only getting two players apiece on board (incidentally the same number as the ATLANTA FALCONS!!!!).  I personally don't see a problem with it.  To me it illustrates an actual strength of those particular teams.  They are low on star power, but high on depth.  So their strength as a team (and what I feel is going to get them each to the Super Bowl) actually hurts them when it comes time to award individual achievement.  You can ask the Texas Rangers and Alex Rodriguez about that.  Speaking of which, I'm always down to give my two cents about A-Rod.  My first published online work was an article written when A-Rod signed his $250 million dollar contract.  Well it seems like the A-Rod to Boston trade is officially dead.  It's going to be interesting to see how each team and the involved players recover (or not) from this debacle.    On one side we have A-Rod who clearly wanted out of Texas and was willing to lose some money to do so.  I would like to be a fly on the wall in the clubhouse around June or July when the Rangers hit that rough stretch, knowing they won't see the plus side of .500 until the next season.  I'm sure there will be some fireworks of some sort.  How about Nomar Garciapara?  I think the Sox have no choice but to still try and unload him, especially in light of Kevin Millar's statements about wanting A-Rod over Nomar.  I think Nomar has a few choice words for him.  The Red Sox will still be a force in the all of a sudden LOADED AL East.  Let's not forget that the Blue Jays were doing well for a while last year, and although they haven't been major players as of yet in the "Hot Stove League" they will probably be improved on experience alone.  The Baltimore Orioles have finally joined the new century and thrown their hat in the Free Agent arena making moves for Miguel Tejada and possibly Vladimir Guerrero and either Pudge Rodriguez or Javy Lopez.  Anf of course the Yankees are still the Yankees.  So what if Andy Pettite and Roger Clemens are gone, they reload like other teams rebuild.  But just imagine if all of the pieces had come together and Boston had gotten A-Rod and Magglio Ordonez as planned.  Well it looks like imagination is all we have as far as that one goes, and somewhere George Steinbrenner is breathing a sigh of relief.  Meanwhile the fans are left with another disappointment to add to their growing list with Major League Baseball.  Next time I'll talk about Bowl Season and College Basketball.  Peace for now!
