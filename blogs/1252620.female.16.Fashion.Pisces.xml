      ..That distant look is in your eyes  I thought with time you'd realize it's over, over It's not the way I choose to live And something somewhere's gotta give A share in this relationship gets older, older  You know I'd fight for you but how could I fight somone who isn't even there I've had the rest of you now I want the best of you I don't care if that's not fair  Cuz I want it all Or nothing at all There's nowhere left to fall When you reach the bottom it's now or never Is it all Or are we just friends Is this how it ends With a simple telephone call  You leave me here with nothing at all  There are time it seems to me I'm sharing you with memories I feel it in my heart but I don't show it , show it Then there's times you look at me As thought I'm all that you could see Those times I don't belive it's right I know it , know it  Don't make me promises baby you never did know how to keep them well I had the rest of you now I want the best of you it's time to show and tell  Cuz I want it all Or nothing at all There's nowhere left to fall When you reach the bottom it's now or never Is it all Or are we just friends Is this how it ends With a simple telephone call  You leave me here with nothing at all  Cuz you and I Could lose it all if you've got no more room  Nowhere inside for me in your life  Cuz I want it all Or Nothing at all There's nowhere left to fall It's now or never  Is it all Or Nothing at all When you reach the bottom it's now or never Is it all Or are we just friends Is this how it ends With a simple telephone call  You leave me here with nothing at all

Could it be the little Things you do to me Feelings that I'm feeling Are so new to me I'm going through So many changes Nothing ever felt As strange as How my heart goes Crazy when you Look at me-oh  When I'm with you Its paradise No place on Earth Could be so nice Through the crystal waterfalls I hear you call Just take my hand Its paradise  You kiss me once I'll kiss you twice  And as I gaze Into your eyes I realise its paradise  Now I know the Sweetest dreams can All come true 'Cause I found Heaven Here on earth When I found you Its nothing I could Ever make up How I hope I never wake up Just to find this Isn't true reality  The world around just Disappears without a trace Telling me that I have Found the perfect place Let it stay this way forever Deep in love and may I never Spend another day Without you close to me  Ooh paradise Yeah  Oh just take my hand Its paradise  You kiss me once I'll kiss you twice  And as I gaze Into your eyes I realise its paradise   Ooh paradise

      "Why do we always go out of our way to hold on to the wrong ones and let the right ones slip right through our fingers?"  "I never thought you'd hurt me, i guess you live and learn, then when you're playing with fire, you're bound to get burned."  "As I stared into your eyes, you asked me why I was about to cry, its because I knew you were going to say good-bye."  "Let me be angry... please. It is the only way that I can keep you from seeing how much I really need you."  "Oh, I shouldn't care or wonder where and how you are, but I can't hide this hurt inside my broken heart. I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before because I'm not supposed to love you anymore."  "Missing you isnt the hardest part, its Knowing that I once had you that breaks my heart."  "And the thing that really bugs me is... those things about you I used to love... those are now the things I hate so much.”One day you will love me as I loved you, one day you will think of me as I thought of you, one day you will cry for me as I cried for you, one day you will want me but I won't want you."  "I have wasted thousands and thousands of kisses on you; kisses I thought were special because of your lips, your smile, and all your color in life. I used to think that was the real you when you smiled, but now I know you don't mean any of it."  "We ignore the ones who adore us and adore the ones who ignore us."  "I wish I had the guts to walk away from what we had. But I cant because I know you wont come after me, and thats what hurts the most."  "Never say goodbye if you still want to try. Never give up if you feel you can go on. Never say you don't love a person if you can't let go."  "I love to say I hate you because it means that I will live my life happily without you, or will sadly live a lie"  "Watching you walk out of my like does not make me bitter or cynical about love, but has rather made me realize that if I wanted so to be with the wrong person, how beautiful it will be when the right one comes along."  "I wish i could read your mind and hear your thoughts as you see me, so that i could just fiugre out if you wanted me or not."

The first thing we did was look for our dorms!! we stayed in Thompson Mangham (room 308) hehe. then wen i went to open the window i scratched me leg against this nail that we sticking out of the bed. and i have this long scratch on my leg and it was all bleeding and stuff. =(  well then we had an opening ceremony and then we had free time. i think we got hung aroung in the lobby. then went to sleep at around 3:30.  then on Fri we woke up at like 8:30 and breakfast was at 8. but we still made it. hehe.. then we went to morning service but we didnt go to a workshop because we weren't too interested in the topics. =/ so then we just hung around and talked and played. hehe. at around 12 something we went to lunch and then we hung out some more after that. after dinner we went to go watch fireworks!! they were so nice. =) man i never saw the sunset tho. =(  so then we went back to the college and did something! hahahaha... BAD KIDs!! haha..wut a nite! okay then we slept at like 4. dont remember wut time we woke up the next day. so we went beading (for the workshop) and we made flip flops! then we played wit waterballons.. hehe...um then there was a talent show and it was funny!! hahahaha.. then stuff.... stuff..... stuff... so then the next day we woke up at like 8:50 and missed breakfast. and was kinda late to service. anyways afterwards we packed up and went to lunch. then on they way home we went to the outlets for like 1 hr. then came home. on the way home i was sleeping in the car.

      ok so monday.. hmm we went out in the morning and then like at around 4 ish we picked up amos and we hung out at our house. we just chilled and then at like almost 7 we took him home cuz he had to go eat dinner wit his family. but then amos calls us back and says that he wants to come over again. haha.. so then like at 10 he came back and chilled some more, took some pictures and talked. we "mugged" the camera. haha.. then his parents picked him up at like 11 something but then his dad had to talk on the phone (in their car) and suddenly amos pops back inside the house and stays for a little while. then leaves at around midnite. *sighs* it was fun. remember those times wen go out after c.c. and stay out past midnite, the bowling and movie times, the TE times, and hanging at ppls houses. we're gonna miss u amos!

       If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?   If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all    I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with    I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?    If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my man?    I don’t know why  you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true    We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life    I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?   ‘ Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today   ‘ Cause I love you ,  whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side    I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I

Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love  Guys are so hard to trust Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl?

      i'm tired.   i tried really hard to be nice.. but its not working. i'm really glad that i didn't give certain things a chance because i can really see what happens when {--_____--} yes.. i shouldn't put in too much detail.  certain people just expect too much. if they like u, they expect you to like them back. and if u don't they just get all retarded and not want to be your friend anymore. they would delete anything that has to do with you. its soo soo dumb. they stil want you to know about them and they have people around you tell you things and its just kinda like "who cares?" But the funny part is you actually know something that the other person doesn't know you know. this makes me laugh!  what's up with stupid chicks looking at people.. its like i was shopping at foever 21 today and this chick kept on looking at me like i didn't notice. i was just standing there and she was like 2 feet away from me looking at me.. i was soo gonna be like "biatch! wut the crap r u looking at!?!?!?" hahaha... but i would never do such thing. hahaha..

      people annoy me!!  why is it that people go and try to look for things that were never there. For example, if feelings were never there, you can't just go and force there to be feelings. It's like impossible and stupid. In the end it's just gonna be bleh. sigh.   I really don't like it when people call me every 5 minutes, to tell u the truth, it annoys me... a lot.   i'm tired of people being.. selfish. sigh..

      it hurt. wut hurt? i dunno.   i was listening to the radio and these people were saying how like  we shouldn't hang onto the past when we can look into the future . so like this girl had a bad relationship with this guy and now she has a new guy, but she's holding things against him for the things the first guy did. but the host person was saying how she shouldn't make the new guy "pay" for the things the first guy did. "if ur in line at a grocery store, the person in front or behind u won't pay for ur groceries." [because its none of their business] so like wut the first guy did has nothing to do with the new guy and she shouldn't hold things against the new guy.  yes.. thats all i remember.. o wait thats all they said. ahaha.  and as we were pulling up in the driveway, we heard this song on the radio but i dunno wut its called. it was realli good.   anyway, its realli funny how certain people are. so a person likes a girl but yet he thinks that trying to get her jealous is realli gonna help. and the thing is the word JEALOUSY is not in her dictionary and plus she doesn't get jealous.  oo and on friday we were watching some movie in english and like i'm guessing it was a love sceen thingy. so the dude's kinda shy but he confesses his love for her and everything.. it was sooo sweet.. i was like "awww" *tear* i'm usually not a big fan of all this cheesy crap but this time it was too sweet! haha....  i'm soo weird! haha..

       i went bowling earlier and i won!  fashO ! hehe.. it [bowling] has become my new favorite sport. :)     &nbsp;  i don't the idea of renewing the friendship was such a good idea. i mean i did try and i will try no more, it has gone out of hand. it's been so friggin long and he's needs to get over it. he needs to stop randomly IMing me and saying stuff. it's really stupid. really tired of it.     &nbsp;  life goes on. you live and learn.

        summer   time ...     &nbsp;   i really want to get  away  from sac. It's getting sooo boring. >sigh    &nbsp;  i guess renewing a friendship is a good thing. Although it may be hard since they don't wanna talk to you and all. I mean i know i'm not the most  lovable  person, but u can't just gossip about me. I mean whats the point of it if i'm gonna find out about what you're saying anyways. if u have something to say.. say it to my face. I've explained everything many times already and i'm tired of repeating myself. if you assume that i'm lying even before i say anything then don't ask for the truth. But i will... thanks enoch.     &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       starting to really like the color orange! hehe..    &nbsp;  everything seems to go in a  circle ... cuz no matter wut it is it always comes back to u or goes back to wherever it started. Even if u don't want to go back to wutever u had/ started with, u just  fall  right back to the same place. sometimes u may not even realize it. let me just tell u, it sucks butt big time!    &nbsp;  i wish there were more good  suprises  in life.. the unexpected  goodies .. its like sometimes u really want something but u don't wanna say it and u get unexpectedly since u didn't think u were gonna get it. then its soo like cute and all... &nbsp; just someone who knows u super well and really knows what&nbsp;u really&nbsp;want..    &nbsp;

       "Sometimes it's easier to pretend things are okay rather than face a difficult truth. So we go through the motions, the rituals of everyday life. We hope the comfortable rythyms of familiarity will hold off the inevitable just a little longer. Return things to normal...anything to buy us more time. Playing pretend, make believe - it might be one thing we never outgrow."
