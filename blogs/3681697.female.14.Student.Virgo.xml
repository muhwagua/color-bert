      Im just writting to say that i really really hate blogs they are so boring and stupid.I think that they are ment to be like diarys.Diary's are ment to be secret but everyone always reads them anyway.If your parents say that they havent  read yours dont worry they are most definatly lying all parents cant resist the idea of being able to know your most personal and privte thoughts.Which really does ruin the purpose of having a secret diary in the first place if its not even secret.Its just the same with thoes stupid poem books, people bring to school with dark and 'meaningfull' poems in themthat they 'really' dont want anyone to read,'really'.To help relise there strong emotions. If you dont want anyone to read them then dont bring the to school for people to see.If u ask me its just an attention seaking thing.Its gay and to make matters worse they leave them everywhere no matter which way u turn theres always one there screaing out to u  READ ME,READ ME ,READ ME.And they always have the owners name neatly printed on the front.So u dont get confused about which depressed,suisidal teenager your actually reading about. Opps there goes half the depressed highschool population out of there class rooms and sharpening their pitchforks.with signs saying kill the evil person who insulted our poem books. * i apologise to those of the high school depressed population who wouldnt do this.but hey its a steriotypical world isnt it. If you are a type of person who likes to analise everything then i would strongly advise that you stoped reading right now .I hate people who analise everyhting that you do. Its sooo annoying its like if your annoyed at something that doesnt mean that theres anything behind that.somethings really are jsut in black and white. well thats all im going to say bye

      ok well my trip started out really really badly. and ended badly. but the middle was ok. i did some really stupid things though. and im glad to be back. because i think if i hadn't moved when i was 11 from america to australia then i would have ended up just like ellen. and although i love ellen heaps, that would be bad. you see ellen is well.... she drinks... alot... and used to smoke pot... alot (but doesnt any more thank God) and she smokes cigaretts.... alot. and im pretty sure she has taken drugs before. shes also not a virgin anymore. but she told me if she could do it over she wouldnt have done it because she would rather be innocent again. in my opinion i dont think she was ever innocent in the first place but you get what i mean. on the subject of me doing stupid things. well we went to ellens best friend Lydiana's graduation party. and i had a few drinks. it wasnt very srtong though so i didnt get drunk or anything. but i did smoke a cigarette. but it was my own choosing, she didnt peer pressure me into doing it or anything. and cait (shes my other best friend. i have lots.) is going to be mad at me for saying this i think but the cigaretts werent that bad. yeah but anyway. hmmm yeah. ok well i could write heaps more but i cant be bothered at the moment. so ill write some more later. byebye luv ya'll

C-C-C-Cinnamon lips and candy kisses, on my tongue. Fun!  B-B-B-Buttery eyes, if only cries could come from those eyes. Oh!  Have you landed yet and, if so, would you let me know?  I'm tired of looking up into those starry eyes.  Does it rain where you are? Does it snow?  And, if so, remind me not to go there, the weather affects my knee.    I've never felt this way before.    C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips, go powder your cheeks and meet your new beau, oh...  C-C-C-Counting sheep, if only sheep could put me to sleep, oh...    I've never felt this way before.   Some day (one day) you'll miss me.  Mundane Sundays, when I'm gone.  One day (some day) you'll miss me.  One day when I'm gone (adieu and so long) One day when I'm gone!   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.   Have you landed yet and, if so, would you let me know? I've never felt this way before.

      well school is boring. i hate it. exept for rock music. rock music owns! and graphic design isnt to bad. but this week it was horrible cuz my brain decided to malfunction. urg! anyway back to rock music. so today we recruited ross our bass player. ross is awsome. and hes quite cute to but that is beside the point. hes really nice. and we got michael as our drummer. hes insane. but oh well i dont care. hes good at it so yeah. and now we have to decide what covers to do and i want to do all of them. but for the moment we can only do one and so im leaning towards imaginary by evanescence. but yeah and other ones we have in mind are - seven nation army, wonderwall, come as you are. um yeah i think thats pretty much it.   and also school is good because i see all of my friends. and tournament of the minds (TOM) is cool to. you do lots of fun things. people think that its really boring and just more work, but what it is for me is an excuse for me to hang out with my friends on the weekedn and my parents have to let me because its educational. you just do alot of drama games and its really fun. my faveorite game is called The Quote Game. and you just write down random quotes on bits of paper, they dont have to be famous, and then you put them in a pile and when its your turn to go up you pick one read it and then try and incorporate it into a senario that your given by the audience without letting them know that youve said the quote. yeah. anyway g2g byebye. love ya'll ~Lily~

      shit. i feel like crying. i just watched 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter. and the last scene you saw bridget crying. and it reminded me so much of all the times i cried. the time i cry at michaels funeral. the time i cried at ana's house just after kit kat had come back from NZ. the time i cried under my cover for three hours. the time i cried in the shower. the time i cried on the plane. the plane. god that was so shit i wrote a letter to kit kat on it. i was crying so hard but i couldn’t make a sound. i just wanted to sob my heart away. to throw myself down on my bed and scream at the top of my lugs. oh how unfair life can be. i was supposed to be happy. i was going to america. i was going to see ellen. why wasn’t i happy. im going to give kit kat the letter. god im almost crying now. im so weak. i hate myself. and then luci had the dream that i had killed myself and she was so upset and then i thought i would be missed so much but i don’t know how to cope at the moment. i just want to breakdown. to have my friends hold me while i cry. but above everything i want ellen. she was the best. ive never felt so alive then when i was with her. she accepted me for who i was and was with me for every step. she complimented me on everything. she encouraged me to be who i really was. and ive to be that person. but i come back here now and i just feel so cooped up. i cant be myself. im so judged, im judged by the people who love me, im judged by those who don’t. im sick of having to hide. im sick of having to lie. its taking up so much of my resources and i just cant deal. ha. alex im doing the one tear thing. maybe ill be depressed enough tomorrow that you’ll get to see it. god i suck. oh my god im turning into what i was last year. i dont want to hate myself. why am i like this. god im so fucked up. I mean compared to some people i have the best life. but to me my life sucks. fuck. ok im gonna shut up now. i think im gonna call kit kat. well cya later luv y'all  ~Lily~

      ive decided  that im boring. i get home from school and i write about my day. but i mean. thats what you supposed to do right? so yeah im gonna be boring now and talk about my day  so... first period was english. our teacher wasn't there again. im so annoyed at her because i need to ask her questions. urg! so in english we went to  the library and then alexs and hellys class came in so i talked to them for a bit and then we got told off so i secretly talked to helly while "reading a book". heehee. and ooh must wash her thingymabobby. i stole it off her so i could wash it. anyway yeah then i had math which was HORRIBLE!!!!!!! because we had a test. but then shes like its only a revision test and because i don't understand anything we are doing i didn't answer any of the questions. i tried to do the first two though. but then i gave up because i knew i was wrong. and so i worked some more on my english homework that i was supposed to hand in on monday but didn't, partly because i hadn't finished and also because she wasn't there. and then at the end of the lesson she read out the answers and then she made us hand them in. so i went up to her and explained that i had no clue how to do anything. and she was very nice about it. she did go on for ages.  and im going to go to a tutorial thing after school on tuesday. until 3.30. but oh well. i'll learn. anyway yeah that was the most eventful thing that happened all day. exept maybe the fact that in rock music (period 3+4) i had to sing into a mic and then everybody was listening and it was very embarrassing. and yeah. so that was my day. much more boring then yesterday. oh well im a boring person so its all good. well byebye luv y'all ~Lily~

      well my day at school was interesting. actually much better than i thought it was going to be. so i got out of the car. as i usually do. and i was walking down the path to get to the main entrance for students and i thought. oh no. graphic design. i used to like it. but i broke up with my b/f on friday and i have gd with him so i was not looking forward to that at all. but it was quite good actually. because i got a good computer and kristian sat next to me. and both he and i had basically no clue how to use bryce 5, this 3d software that we're using at the moment. so we're sitting there just fiddling away. laughing at the ridiculous colour we're making the mountain and the grass. and suddenly its 10.45 and time for recess. and we part our separate way and i leave that class much happier than when i came in.   and then recess um, i cant remember. ive had a slight case of amnesia here folks im sorry you’ll just have to live without a recall of my recess.   anyway the after recess we had double sose with Mr. Lockhart. i hate sose at the moment its boring as hell. actaully ive always hated sose. but i like history a lot. that might've just been the teacher, Mr. Williamson (Mr. Will) he’s the coolest teacher in the whole world. anyway back on track. sose. i sat by myself until arlin felt sorry for me sitting there all by my lonesome. ppft. as if. thats what he told me. he just wanted someone smart to copy off of. i let him though. im a sucker. plus arlin is ok. anyway. yeah he sat next to me then malachi sat next to arlin. and yeah. the two hours progressed very slowly. but i did the work. arlin copied off me. stabbed arlin with my pen. got in trouble for laughing. arlin went through my bag. took my gum. threatened to stab him again. he didnt give me back my gum. he stole a piece and then so did malachi. i didnt really care. hmm. then i our teacher was going on about that if you do something wrong in school, the levels of where it goes like teacher, grade co-coordinator etc etc. so then i asked him to who would it go if you got caught dealing. and he didnt know what dealing was exactly. hes so dumb. i mean how could you not know. i asked him this because of elle. and once i asked him will looks at my from across the room. smiling/laughing at me. and so i told him to shut up. and i started to laugh a little bit. and yeah. um then we had to do more work. and arlin was telling me funny stories so i started telling him about the time me and elle went babysitting and ellen brought along a bottle of "ginger ale" (really alcohol, quite strong too i might add.) and she drank a bit of lit like 3 sips and was getting tipsy. and anyway then Mr. L was like lily stop talking and get on with you work. and then i just kept talking but more quietly. and then mr. L was reading out the answers and i asked malachi what the answer was to a question and Mr. L is like Lily im sick of hearing you laughing and blabbering away so you can move if you like. and im like no sorry. and yeah. it was funny. anyway then there was lunch   lunch  was  rather  boring  today  because  alex  and  others  were  at  choir  ok ill stop writing like this its pissing me off. um lunch. luci and i listened to music as we usually do. then sam was like hey listen to this. but ur not allowed to see the front. so were like ummmmm. ok. it turned out to be shannon nole. or however you spell his stupid name. heehee t’was funny! and yeah. i did do choir but i quit because it sucked. um yeah and i forgot to eat lunch.it just slipped my mind. then everyone swapped bags. well not every one but most ppl. i didnt. ph well. um then i had to go to class :(   the next class happened to be science. and i sat with arlin and malachi. and arlin was chopping bits out of malachi’s ruler and the the ruler shattered all over the floor. and then arlin decided that he wanted to draw on me with whiteboard marker. so i was like no piss of. stop. and then he went for my pants but didnt get them and then im like NO, NOT THE SHOES!!!!!!!!! and he started laughing. and yeah. he did get it on my sweater though. and all over my hands and on my book though. so i boycotted the drawing on me. and moved to a science lab desk thing where you do all the experiments. than it was time to go and i was happy because i could leave. yeah   then i came home. and finished the book i was reading called finding cassie crazy by jaclyn moriarty. which is a really good book. then i went online at 4.30 and started writing this and now i am finished at 5.59 pm on today. byebye luv ya'll  ~Lily~

      ah well elliot hasnt come on msn. oh well im sure we can talk later. i had my party yesterday and today and it was fun! but then again it  wasnt very fun either because we bought spray paint and then when luci did her tag on a peice of paper ella got all upset and started crying and shit. and i realy dont want to go to school tomoz. i think ill tell my parents that im feeling rather ill because both phoebe and jess had a cold and i need to get better soon because of the rock challenge. and yeah i hope it works. my watch is slowly dying. the glass is all cracked even more :( oh this is evil. cant talk about it though ive said to much already. byebye luv y'all ~Lily~
