      I haven't posted for four days, so thought I'd better write another entry before I stop alltogether.  I got a call today from a careers advisor at my school. Didn't catch most of what she said as I was tired, but she asked if I was coming back to sixth form and what subjects I was doing. She also asked if I was going to school to get my GCSE results. Dunno why she called... It was pointless really. Think I said "yes" to most of what she asked as I was tired, even though it was around 2pm...  I was just lying in bed day dreaming when she rang. She well fucked it up. I was thinking about Jamie, and how things will be when he moves here. He gets his A Level results this Thursday. Pretty sure he will have done fine, so not sure why he's worried. If he doesn't go to Leeds Met, he'll go to Sheffield. It's not that far...  I'm friends with Wendy now, though we apologised to each other online. She asked if I wanted to go to town this week, but I don't know if I can be arsed. There isn't really anything there to go for. I'd rather go do something like go-karting or paintballing... Or to a theme park. I sooooo wanna go on some rides.  I really really wanna go to Blackpool Pleasure Beach! And the London Dungeon! Grrr. My sister has said when she starts her new job, she'll save up and take me to Blackpool. Knowing her she'll drag me where she wants to go though - she's 23 by the way. Leanne and Wendy have also said they'll go with me, but Leanne won't go on trains... Don't think I'm getting a coach to Blackpool unless getting the train is really expensive.  Oooh that reminds me, they have a fair at Roundhay Park on Bonfire Night! Yay, can't wait. The rides aren't that good, but this year hopefully Jamie will be able to come. They have a really nice fireworks display. It's just getting there that's gonna be a problem. Maybe dad will drop us off... that's if it's not just me and Jamie alone. So may have to ask Wendy and Leanne to come.   Hmm, what else do I have to say? Ooh I can't wait to get my GCSE results. Dunno why, they're bound to be bad. Guess I just wanna see friends really. And I'm still hoping for an A* in ICT! Plus a few B's. Some C's. And two or three D's. Pleeeease don't give me anything lower. I'll feel so stupid because I know if I'd tried hard enough, I could've got all my results C's or higher.  Anyway thats about it for today...

      Dad woke me up early today....  "AMY! Becky's here!"  What? Why's Becky here? I haven't seen her since our GCSE exams in May... When my sister commented on her looking pregnant.  Turns out that she came to tell me she's pregnant... She's only just found out. How coud she not know!? She's seven months gone. She is only tiny though, and doesn't look seven months. She thinks it's gonna be born on my birthday, bless.  I'm a little worried she won't be able to cope and maybe have it taken off her. She's only just been for her first scan, to hear its heartbeat. She's going to see a midwife on Thursday to get a scan and find out what sex it is. I know she's scared of giving birth, but she seems really happy about it.  Her boyfriend is 23, I think at that age he'd have been a little more careful, but by the sound of it he wants the baby too. Shes only 16. A few days older than me, as she always says... "I'm older than you - by eight days!" She doesn't act older than me though. She acts young for her age.  She has always been hyper and immature, although recently I think she's grown up a bit. She used to drink and smoke, but now she's stopped because she's pregnant. I always thought Rachel would be the first of my friends to get pregnant. I was really, really wrong...  I never, ever expected Becky to get pregnant. I'm soooooo shocked. I feel really weird. I felt like this when I was told Dolly was pregnant too. She used to be my best friend, but then we fell out and she moved house. I havent seen her for like five years now. I did once see her in town last year. Anyway she had a baby at 16. She'll be around 18 now. I found out from Vicky that she called it Chloe.  Wonder what Becky will call her baby. She told me her boyfriend wants to call it Libby if it's a girl.  Ugh.  Maybe she'll name it after me, hehe. I am her best friend, after all! Even though we hardly see each other, we have been friends since nursery. Almost 17 years I guess. I think even though we hardly ever see each other, we'll be friends for a long time.  She did get in with a bad crowd, and that's mainly why I never see her. And then there's the fact that she is hyper and immature. Well, not any more it seems... Though she's a little childish. Things will probably never be the same for her now she's expecting a baby. She's going to college in September, and it's due in November.  Not sure how she will cope, but as I'm one of her oldest friends I will do my best to help her. I'm actually looking forward to seeing her scan next week. Boy or girl? She wants a boy, hope she gets what she wants. I'd love to be there for her during the birth as well, but it'd be a little weird.  God parents! Pick meeeee. Lol.  Would be really nice to have a part in it, but I'm not likely to. She's gonna be too busy for me. Well, then again... I don't think she'll know what to do with a baby. I'm guessing her mum will help a hell of a lot. When it gets to be a toddler, things will calm down a bit I'm sure, but knowing how she was as a kid... God help the baby.  She was prodding it today, and I'm like "Don't prod it! You might hurt it." And she's like "No I won't, it doesn't matter if it turns out stupid anyway cos I'm stupid. I dont't want it to be smarter than me!" What? You dont want a stupid baby. You should want it to be smart!  She told me to put my finger in her  belly button  to feel its umbilical cord...  Eeerrr.  I wouldn't do it. She settled with having me feel her stomach. It was hard and ikky.. Well not ikky, but... different.  I never wanna get pregnant. Ugh. Pain!  My mum was saying to me today would she have got rid of it if she knew earlier... And I said no, I don't think she'd ever do that.  Anyway... I'm happy for her if she's happy for herself.

      Bored again. So doing yet more tests - on  urlLink www.tickle.com .     The Relationship Assessment Test:  Amy, your relationship is more likely to last if you and your partner improve how you   understand each other's strengths and weaknesses  .    The Zodiac Match Test:  Amy, the best Zodiac Match for your personality is   Leo  .   Palm Reading Test:  Amy, your palm reveals you are especially good at   letting your love flow  . Our psychologists were able to confirm what palmists have known for centuries: the lines in your palm reveal many things about you - including details about your future. Your palm shows you are a very warm and compassionate person. You give your affection freely to friends and family that you care about most   What's Your Back To School Style:  Amy, your back-to-school style is   Funky 'n' Fabulous.      What's your Cat's Type:  Amy, your cat's a   Mugger  . Talk about mugging for the camera! That's right, your cat's a natural-born showoff with a wild independent streak. How else would they end up being the center of attention so often? And really, what could be more endearing than a furry little friend who steals the show — whether you're home alone, or hosting a dinner party?   What Zodiac Sign Should You Be:  The planets are very complex. Maybe your astrologer will disagree, and maybe a few tendencies will vary, but overall you're a   SCORPIO  . You're just like a water sign, which comes out in the way you're so in tune with your emotions and your intuitions. Your symbol is a scorpion, which represents your secretive nature and your ability to emit a powerful poison when vengeful. A bundle of contradictions, you have the ability to demonstrate both the best and worst qualities that characterize human nature. Generally, you are intense and passionate, yet stubborn and competitive. You use your intuition fearlessly, and you have a tendency to explore the nature of existence through the study of philosophy and religion. Although it is difficult for you to trust others, whenever you finally do, the result is deep and powerful. On the downside, however, you must work hard to suppress your jealousy. Your dedication, drive, and persistence will guarantee you success, and you are known and respected for your imagination and idealism.   What's Your True Colour:  Amy, your true color is    Blue   ! You're blue - the most soothing shade of the spectrum. The color of a clear summer sky or a deep, reflective ocean, blue has traditionally symbolized trust, solitude, and loyalty. Most likely a thoughtful person who values spending some time on your own, you'd rather connect deeply with a few people than have a bunch of slight acquaintances. Luckily, making close friends isn't that hard, since people are naturally attracted to you - they're soothed by your calming presence. Cool and collected, you rarely overreact. Instead, you think things through before coming to a decision. That level-headed, thoughtful approach to life is patently blue - and patently you!    Getting a bit bored of taking tests now.

      Feeling better today, so thought I would do some of those silly tests they have on Spark Life -  urlLink www.sparknotes.com .     The Stress Test:  You exhibit a Stress Factor of   ((( 16% )))   - which barely registers. Get a job, hippie!   The Death Test:  You can expect to die on:   Thursday, January 9th 2059   at the tender age of   71   years old. On that date, you will most likely die from: Cancer (10%), Alcoholism (4%), Alien Abduction (4%), Homicide (3%)   The Jerk Test:  The results are in... you are certifiably   ((( 25% )))   Jerk! That's lower than the worldwide average of 28%!    The IQ Test:  The results have been tabulated, and your IQ is...   ((( 103 )))   That's about average for your age and sex.   The Love Test:  You are officially...   ((( 8% )))   in Lust! That's lustier than the worldwide average of 21% in love! Is it a bird? A plane? Is it a boy? A girl? Is it love, or is it lust? Ah, you. You are that rare mix of sensitive and sensual, romantic and randy, pride and prejudice, etc. When you see your crush, you waffle like a Belgian, unsure of whether you'd rather paint their toes or suck on their toes. Poets have long been puzzled by your kind. You'll never fall for robots or nymphos, but you will suffer longs bouts of marriage.   The Unintelligence Test:  The results are in! You are...   ((( 61% )))   Untelligent! Your score is close to the current worldwide average of 64%. Here is the custom report of your personality than led our team of geeks to conclude (with confidence) that you are a moderate but   excitingly different woman  : "The subject shows an astounding level of intelligence, and her sense of observation is one of her best qualities. Considering this, she shows a lot of potential, but that's only part of the equation. The subject is brave, however, and shows real strength in that department. Courageousness is a large part of untelligence. Finally, the subject displayed a poor (and a little bit boring) sense of humor, a nearly satanic lack of morality, and a complete lack of self-confidence. The balance of these three traits is important; high levels of confidence, medium levels of morality, and a good level of humor make for the strongest individuals."   The Greed Test:  Greedy animal! You are certifiably:   ((( 25% )))   Greedy! That's lower than the Worldwide Greed Average of 35%!    The Gender Test:  It all adds up... we feel   ((( 36% )))   certain that you are... A Woman! How do we know? Well, deep down, your gender affects everything about you, from your favorite number to your views on Canada. Many women who took the test think and act just like you, as you can see from the graph above. Statistically speaking, you are a woman - whether you know it or not.   The Dateable Test:  Hot Cha! You are:   ((( 42% )))   Dateable! That's lower than the Worldwide Dateability Average of 63%! You are neither more nor less dateable than your peers— welcome to the land of mediocrity, home of the masses! You have an undeniable animal magnetism, but you're just as likely to attract small animals as you are to attract human beings. Nevertheless, the people you flirt with generally find you funny and cute, or "fute." You have good hygiene, which is an imporant aspect of relationships involving two or more people. Avoid seafood and walks in the woods.   The Personality Test:    You are a Dreamer!   (Submissive Introverted Abstract Feeler) - reserved and imaginative. You are basically the shy, silent type. You don't have much interest in facts and figures or most of what's going on around you, but the internal worlds you build for yourself are rich and complex. Luckily, your creativity and strong heart mean you have a deep personality evident to anyone who gets to know you. It's just that not many people do. Talk to yourself less, other people more.    The Wench Test:  The results are in... thou art:   ((( 37% )))   Wench! That's equal to the worldwide average of 37%!    Wow... I've had such a fun day taking all those tests.  *Sarcasm*  Anyway, maybe that shows a better insight to the sort of person I am.

      Annoyed with Jamie at the moment... And feeling a little down.  Seem to get annoyed with him quite a lot. He had a go at me over something he obviously feels strongy about, and it's not as if I'd know anything about it, so just basically took it very badly. Not sure if he's noticed yet.  I'm the sorta person who gets offended and upset quite easily but I don't show it with words, just tend to give the guilty person the silent treatment. Feeling pretty pissed off at the moment and not really willing to show any affection towards Jamie because he upset me.  I never seem to be able to forgive people easily, and so give them the cold shoulder for a few days before giving in and showing affection. Never really worked out why I find it so hard to trust people and forgive them when they do silly little things that upset me.  I'm guessing it's all to do with the fact that I was bullied at primary school. Not very confident with myself, and so prefer to stay in rather than go out and possibly be faced with someone who likes to express their thoughts openly. A lot of my 'friends' don't understand why I lack self esteem. Even Jamie is pretty oblivious to it, though he does know I don't particularly like who I am, not sure he's chosen to acknowledge it properly though. It's usually "go to the gym then." It's not as easy as that though, is it? Nothing ever is.  I've been asking my parents to pay for me to go to a gym with my sister for 10 months now. My sister has lost a lot of weight and is currently a size 12, while I've only managed to lose three stone. She often nags me to go to town with her and then she drags me to shops where only the skinniest of people go - New Look, Select and so on... I'm sure she just likes to shove it in my face that I can't wear clothes like that.  Then we come to my sister. I hate her sometimes. I can't say I love her, even though I'd be devastated if anything ever happened to her. She's one of the people that used to bully me I guess. She has always been bigger than me and so if we ever had a fight it would usually result in me cowering in my room after having her take her anger out on me by hitting me repeatedly. My parents didn't stop her like most parents would do... They just ignored it. If I remember right, I'd catch mum laughing a little sometimes. My grandma was the only person who stuck up for me. She hasn't really done it much in recent years.  It's unfair that everyone in my family is thin and I'm fat. I feel out of place, kinda like the black sheep of the family. I feel so out of place with my so called 'friends' as well. Maybe they want me to be fat so they look good. I dunno. I feel out of place with Jamie too. He deserves so much more than I can give him, and I hate myself for that.  I feel out of place with everyone.

      Hmm. I've done sod all today.  I installed The Sims, only to find that it wouldn't work. So I tried installing it again after uninstalling it - and it wouldn't work. Did eventually get it installed again, only to find the same problem... So what do I do? It's installed on my dads computer, but I rarely get on it as either one of my parents is on it, or my sister. I'd have to fight them to get on it. Silly computer.  Leanne called me today at like 11am. I was still sleepy so I just let it vibrate and ignored her. She called back later though. She's just got back from a week in Scarborough - fun. She blabbed on a bit, then went. She called back later to ask if I'd go to the doctors with her on Wednesday.  *Rolls eyes*  What am I, her mum? I'm not walking up there... It'll probably piss it down knowing my luck.  Anyway, most of my days are spent waiting for Jamie to come home from work and get online. I do actually count down the hours, sad as it is. Today he came on a little later because he had to go to the doctors, but my mum had put my computer on defrag anyway because of the trouble I've had with it lately.  Back to Jamie... I felt differently for him yesterday. Not sure why it happens, but some days I love him lots and other days I don't really feel anything for him. That's not to say I don't love him... I just don't feel anything, like everything is empty and I have no feelings at all. It's a little scary.  What else have I done today?  *Thinks*  Nothing... And what am I gonna do for the rest of the week?  Nothing...

      Today's agenda:  SmeagleLuvsU: i just farted n it stung ma arse Cannibal Sheepy: ew SmeagleLuvsU: lol SmeagleLuvsU: sniff up!  A usual conversation between me and my 'friend' Wendy normally starts like this. (Wendy is SmeagleLuvsU by the way) Although we fell out recently, we now seem to be talking online. She hasn't apologised to me for being a total bitch though! I'm always the one to say sorry first to friends, so this time I've decided not to.  I'm currently listening to a Casaloco song I've been after for a long time. Full blast. Hopefully next door won't complain, as they usually do - and then they have the cheek to let their 'little' brat of a kid scream and cry, the spoilt cow. I can't stand her. 10am in the morning when I'm trying to lie in, she starts screaming and doesn't stop until she gets her own way.  I usually get my own way, but I can tell you I don't scream until I do...  How clean is your arse? says: boo dint u get ma txt? Arise, Fair Sun, And Kill The Envious Moon says: yeah I fell asleep tho  Another friend of mine.  That's a lie. I couldn't be arsed texting him back. He was being dirty and I'd get told off if I replied. Why is it that I always get stuck with the horny males? The only person I'm willing to help is Jamie, or rather that's what I've got to abide by.    urlLink http://www.dorrk.com/contenti/story_fat.jpg     And who's this? Why, it's only Charlene, a.k.a 'Baby Whale.' The most despised girl in the whole of my school. Well, she doesn't actually look like that... But I can see the resemblance.  I could go on and on about how much she annoys me. For one, she copys my ideas in my English lessons! She's also a user and a backstabber. The latest gossip circulating around my school is that she accused her step dad of raping her - urg, yeah right. As if he'd even want to shag a 4'10"  tub of lard .  Anyway.  "Amy, come and open the door for me!"  My sister forgot her door keys - again. Then she made me feed the cat. She bought me a cornish pasty while she was out. I don't usually eat them because they're ikky, but I was hungry so I started to bite into it, and...  "Eeerr it's got big onions in it!"  Soon put me off.  Also got a phone call from a friend at school. "Hiiiiii, bet you're surprised I'm ringing you!" Very. We had a chat about... Not much. School and exam results and AS Level courses. She's only going to be in one of my lessons.  So in September I'm gonna be in Year 12 - Yippee? No, I'm scared I won't be able to cope. I've chosen Art Graphics, ICT, English Literature and RE. I've got a feeling that English is gonna be really hard - that's if I'm allowed to do it. I need a C in GCSE English Lit, but hopefully if I get something lower they'll still let me do it as normally I do quite well in English.  I think thats about it now.  Still waiting for Jamie to stop wanking or stop whatever he is doing and talk to me. That's one of the things I get moody over - not having him lavish his undivided attention upon me!!

      I realised today that:   My life sucks .  I am midlessly  bored , waiting for something, anything to come up, to save me from an endless pit of bordomness.  Okay, that was a little dramatic. The main reason I've created this is because I have nothing better to do with my sad little life. Past journals/diarys have been scrapped, so let's see how long this 'blog' will last!  Right now I'm feeling a little tired and drowsy, also feeling my period pains start to kick in! Only another five days of mind numbing pain to go...  Also only 18 days to go until I get my GCSE results - All  A* 's, no doubt! I'm shitting myself at the thought of opening a large brown envelope and having a big blaring fat  F  stare back defiantly at me, proving that I really am a typical blonde.  *Crosses fingers*   I'm guessing all my innermost thoughts are 'supposed' to be on here, but I'd better be careful what I say in case anyone I know reads this... There's nothing really interesting about my life, I do sod all to be honest.  I've been sat at home for the past three months after completing my GCSE exams. I've not been out of my house much except to go to a crappy Summer School and to stay over at friends houses and go shopping.  The only highlight of my summer holidays has been meeting someone I'm  madly in love  with online. Wonder if I should name him? It went horribly wrong at first, not at all how I expected it to be. Things soon picked up when we were alone though. I don't suppose he'd appreciate me posting what we got up to, even though I'm tempted to write down all the details so I never forget. Sad, aren't I?  After meeting him my thoughts and feelings were all over the place. I am still in love with him, although my feelings of wanting him have intensified a lot more and I hate not being with him. He is hopefully moving to the city I live in to go to university, instead of being 200 odd miles away from me, getting up to God knows what.  I'm gonna be honest now and say I think I'm horrible to him more than I should be. He lets me get away with a lot of things and I think I take advantage a little bit. I don't mean to be nasty to him most of the time, I just get frustrated with him and act like a bitch. He's not left me over one of my moods yet, thank God. Not sure what I would do without him when I think hard about it.  I know I will never meet someone else like him if I lose him.  Anyway I think I'm going on a bit too much about him.  *Blush*  I don't really have much else to say, other than it's really hot and I don't think I'm gonna sleep well tonight.  I'll write something more about myself later on, but for now I'll leave whoever finds this guessing about me...
