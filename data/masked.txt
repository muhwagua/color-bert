the army corps was about to arrive, practically as a whole unit, in south africa; but it was evident that the exigencies of the situation, and the widely divided areas of invasion, would at least defer the execution of the plan which had been formed for an invasion of the [MASK] free state from cape colony.
lord roberts's plan was first to concentrate to his left, taking every measure to induce the boers to believe that the original scheme of invasion by the centre would now be resumed, and in this purpose he succeeded so well that his field army with the necessary transport for a cross-country march was assembled between the [MASK] and the modder without serious mishap. cronje at the new centre of gravity was not reinforced, all available boers drawing down towards colesberg.

but this " critical value " of the force is found to depend in an unexpected manner upon the hardness of the steel; the critical value diminishes as the hardness becomes greater up to a certain point, corresponding to a [MASK] temper, after which it increases and with the hardest steel becomes very high.
for steel which has been made redhot, suddenly cooled, and then let down to a [MASK] temper, the critical value of the magnetizing force is smaller than for steel which is either softer or harder; it is indeed so small that the metal contracts like nickel even under weak magnetizing forces, without undergoing any preliminary extension that can be detected.

in 1789 klaproth isolated from pitchblende a [MASK] oxide which he viewed as the oxide of a new metal, which he named uranium, after the newly discovered planet of herschel.
berzelius about 1823 found that the [MASK] oxide, when treated with excess of sulphuric acid, gave a sulphate not unlike the ferric salt.
he concluded that the uranium salt was ur 2033s0 3, where ur 2 0 3, according to his analysis, represents 864 parts of [MASK] oxide (0 = 16).
like fe 2 0 3, the [MASK] oxide lost 48 parts of oxygen per ur203 (= 864 parts) as water, while ur 2 = 816 parts of metal remained.
peligot's results, though called in question by berzelius, have been amply confirmed by all subsequent investigators; only now, on theoretical grounds, first set forth by mendeleeff, we double peligot's atomic weight, so that u now signifies 240 parts of uranium, while uo 3 stands as the formula of the [MASK] oxide, and uo 2 as that of berzelius's metal.
the precipitate, after having been collected and washed, is digested with a warm concentrated solution of ammonium carbonate, which dissolves the uranium as a [MASK] solution of ammonium uranate, while the hydrated oxide of iron, the alumina, &c., remain.
dilute sulphuric acid attacks it but slowly; hydrochloric acid, especially if strong, dissolves it readily, with the formation, more immediately, of a hyacinthcoloured solution of u 2 c1 6, which, however, readily absorbs oxygen from the air, with the formation of a green solution of uc1 4, which in its turn gradually passes into one of [MASK] uranyl salt, u02.

stannic sulphide, sns 2, is obtained by heating a mixture of tin (or, better, tin amalgam), sulphur and sal-ammoniac in proper proportions in the beautiful form of aurum musivum (mosaic gold) - a solid consisting of golden [MASK], metallic lustrous scales, and used chiefly as a yellow "bronze" for plaster-of-paris statuettes, &c. the yellow precipitate of stannic sulphide obtained by adding sulphuretted hydrogen to a stannic solution readily dissolves in solutions of the alkaline sulphides to form thiostannates of the formula m 2 sns 31 the free acid, h2sns3, may be obtained as an almost black powder by drying the yellow precipitate formed when hydrochloric acid is added to a solution of a thiostannate.
stannous salt solutions yield a brown precipitate of sns with sulphuretted hydrogen, which is insoluble in cold dilute acids and in real sulphide of ammonium, (nh 4) 2 s; but the [MASK], or the colourless reagent on addition of sulphur, dissolves the precipitate as sns 2 salt.
the solution on acidification yields a [MASK] precipitate of this sulphide.
stannic salt solutions give a [MASK] precipitate of sns 2 with sulphuretted hydrogen, which is insoluble in cold dilute acids but readily soluble in sulphide of ammonium, and is re-precipitated therefrom as sns2 on acidification.

surrounding the [MASK] is a space called a ditch, which is nearly but not quite on a level with the green and slopes gently away from it, the side next the turf being lined with boarding, the ditch itself bottomed with wooden spars resting on the foundation.
a [MASK] is divided into spaces usually from 18 to 21 ft.
the end ditch within the limits of the space is, according to scottish laws, regarded as part of the [MASK], a regulation which prejudices the general acceptance of those laws.
on crown-[MASK]s it is customary to use a small biased wooden jack to give the bowler some clue to the run of the green.
the bowler delivers his bowl with one foot on a mat or footer, made of india-rubber or cocoanut fibre, the size of which is also prescribed by rule as 24 by 16 in., though, with a view to protecting the [MASK], australasian clubs employ a much larger size, and require the bowler to keep both feet on the mat in the act of delivery.

lake champlain, which lies beautifully in the valley between the [MASK] and adirondack mountains, belongs mostly to vermont.
vermont (vert mont), the [MASK] mountain state, was so named from the evergreen forests of its mountains, whose principal trees are spruce and fir on the upper slopes and white pine and hemlock on the lower.
along the shore of lake champlain are a few species of maritime plants that remain from the time when portions of western vermont were covered by the sea, and on the upper slopes of some of the higher mountains are a few alpine species; these, however, are much less numerous on the [MASK] mountains of vermont than on the white mountains of new hampshire.

upon andrew jackson's election to the presidency, the telegraph became the principal mouthpiece of the administration, and received printing patronage estimated in value at $50,000 a year, while [MASK] became one of the coterie of unofficial advisers of jackson known as the "kitchen cabinet."
in the quarrel between jackson and john c. calhoun, [MASK] supported the latter, and through the columns of the telegraph violently attacked the administration.
[MASK], however, continued to edit it in the calhoun interest until 1835, and gave vigorous support to that leader's nullification views.

its fragrant shoots and the fine yellow [MASK] of the young leaves recommend it to the ornamental planter.
the molybdates may be recognized by the fact that they give a white precipitate on the addition of hydrochloric or nitric acids to their solutions, and that with reducing agents (zinc and sulphuric acid) they give generally a blue coloration which turns to a [MASK] and finally to a brown colour.
the algal fungi, phycomycetes, are obviously derived from the [MASK] algae, while the remaining fungi, the eumycetes, appear to have sprung from the same stock as the rhodophyceae.

con.) [MASK] assimilating cortical branches, which are the ends of branches from the medulla and fit tightly together, forming the continuous surface of the plant.
in the algae such a cell consists essentially of: (1) a mass of protoplasm provided with (2) a nucleus and (3) an assimilating apparatus consisting of a colored protoplasmic body, called a chromatophore, the pigment of which in the pure [MASK] forms is chlorophyll, and which may then be called a cliloroplast.
it is from such a living and assimilating cell, performing as it does all the vital functions of a [MASK] plant, that, according to current theory, all the different cell-forms of a higher plant have been differentiated in the course of descent.
among the [MASK] algae the differentiation of cells is comparatively slight.
the thallus in all cases consists of a branched filament of cells placed end to end, as in many of the [MASK] algae.
many of the lower forms of brown seaweeds (phoeophyceae) have a thallus consisting of simple or branched cell threads, as in the [MASK] and red forms. the lateral union of the branches to form a solid thallus is not, however, so common, nor is it carried to so high a pitch of elaboration as in the rhodophyceae.
the simpler fungi, like the simpler [MASK] algae, consist of single cells or simple or branched cell-threads, but among the higher kinds a massive body is often formed, particutissue t~jf larly in con nexion with the formation of spores, and, er~n,~,onthis may exhibit considerable tissue-differentiation.
similar modes of growth occur among the siphoneous [MASK] algae and also among the red seaweeds.
of the thallus, whatever its external form, by branched, continuous or septate, coenocytic tubes (siphoneae and fungi), or by simple or branched cell-threads (red and many [MASK] algae), in both cases growing mainly or entirely at the apex of each branch, is almost universal in.

the latter are plates of [MASK] tissue one cell thick, while the stem consists of uniform more or less elongated cylindrical cells.
the root differs from the shoot in the characters of its surface tissues, in the absence of the [MASK] assimilative pigment chlorophyll, in the arrangement of its vascular system and in the mode of growth at the apex, all features which are in direct relation to its normally subterranean life and its fixative and absorptive functions.
in all [MASK] plants which have a special protective epidermis, the cortex of the shoot has to perform the primitive fundamental function of carbon assimilation.
the cortex of a young stem is usually [MASK], and plays a more or less important part in the assimilative function.
it does not at first appear to be the same with the bulkier plants, such as the ordinary [MASK] herbs, shrubs or trees, but a study of their earlier development indicates that they do not at the outset differ in any way from the simple undifferentiated forms. each commences its existence as a simple naked protoplast, in the embroyo-sac or the archegonium, as the case may be.
we have the formation of numerous mechanisms which have arisen in connection with the question of food supply, which may not only involve particular cells, but also lead to differentiation in the protoplasm of those cells, as in the development of the chloroplastids of the leaves and other [MASK] parts.
brown and escombe have shown that the amount of solar energy taken up by a [MASK] leaf may often be fifty times as much as it can utilize in the constructive processes of which it is the seat.

each is a small protoplasmic body, in the meshes of whose vubstance the [MASK] coloring matter chlorophyll is contained in some form of solution.
if not, there must exist in the [MASK] plant, side by side with it, another mechanism which is concerned with the manufacture of the complex compounds in which nitrogen is present.
the probability is that this mechanism is to be found in [MASK] plants in the leavesat any rate there is a certain body of evidence pointing in this direction.
the [MASK] plant prefers as a rule nitrates of various metals, such as calcium, magnesium or potassium.
the normal [MASK] plant is seen thus to be in possession of a complete machinery for the manufacture of its own food.
the power of [MASK] plants, not even specialized in any of these directions, to absorb certain carbohydrates, particularly sugars, from the soil was demonstrated by acton in 1889.
bonnier has drawn attention to the fact that the mistletoe in its turn, remaining [MASK] in the winter, contributes food material to its host when the latter has lost its leaves.
mycorhizas.the most interesting cases, however, in which fungi form symbiotic relationships with [MASK] plants have been discovered in connection with forest trees.
each species of [MASK] plant may form a mycorhiza with two or three different fungi, and a single species of fungus may enter into symbiosis with several green plants.
these are: (i) that the [MASK] plant is so stimulated by the symbiotic association which leads to the hypertrophy, that it is able to fix the nitrogen or cause it to enter into combination.
that the fixation of the gas is carried out by the fungal organism either in the soil or in the plant, and the nitrogenous substance so produced is absorbed by the organism, which is in turn consumed by the [MASK] plant.
whichever opinion is held on this point, there seems no room for doubt that the fixation of the nitrogen is concerned only with the root, and that the [MASK] leavec take no part in it.
this coloring matter, as shown by its absorption spectrum, picks out of the ordinary beam of light a large proportion of its red and blue rays, together with some of the [MASK] and yellow.

the principal symptom may show itself in general pallor, including all cases where the normal healthy [MASK] hue is replaced by a sickly yellowish hue indicating that the chlorophyll apparatus is deficient.
the chloroplasts are generally distinguished by their [MASK] color, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll; but in many algae this is masked by another coloring matterph ycoerytlsrin in the florideae, phycophaein in the phaeophyceae, and phycocyanin in the cyanophyceae.
these substances can, however, be dissolved out in water, and the [MASK] coloring matter of the chloroplast then becomes visible.

the eggcell or oosphere is a large cell containing a single large nucleus, and in the [MASK] plants the rudiments of plastids.
metamorphosis.it has already been pointed out that each kind of member of the body may present a variety of forms. for example, a stem may be a tree-trunk, or a twining stem, or a tendril, or a thorn, or a creeping rhizome, or a tuber; a leaf may be a [MASK] foliage-leaf, or a scale protecting a bud, or a tendril, or a pitcher, or a floral leaf, either sepal, petal, stamen or carpel (sporophyll); a root may be a fibrous root, or a swollen tap-root like that of the beet or the turnip. all these various forms are organs discharging some special function, and are examples of what wolff called modification, and goethe metamorphosis.

they were fed with hay during the annual inundation, and at other times tethered in meadows of [MASK] clover.
in addition to the use of several kinds of animal and other manures, [MASK] crops were sometimes ploughed in by the romans.
from the third edition of hartlib's legacie we learn that clover was cut [MASK] and given to cattle; and it appears that this practice of soiling, as it is now called, had become very common about the beginning of the 18th century, wherever clover was cultivated.
[MASK] crops, such as turnips, clover and rye grass, began to be alternated with grain crops, whence the name alternate husbandry.
nor did this increased tillage interfere with the increase of live stock, as the [MASK] crops of the alternate husbandry more than compensated for the diminished pasturage.
the great losses arising from spoilt hay crops served to stimulate experimental inquiry into the method of preserving [MASK] fodder known as ensilage, with the result that the system eventually became successfully incorporated in the ordinary routine of agricultural practice.
rye is perhaps more largely grown as a [MASK] crop to be fed off by sheep, or cut green for soiling, in the spring months.

it is a matter of common observation that the [MASK] of the sky is highly variable.
it is evident that the normal [MASK] is more or less diluted with extraneous white light, having its origin in reflections from the grosser particles of foreign matter with which the air is usually charged.
as to the origin of the normal [MASK], very discrepant views have been held.
some writers, even of good reputation, have held that the [MASK] is the true body colour of the air, or of some ingredient in it such as ozone.

briicke also brought forward an experiment of great importance, in which he showed that gum mastic, precipitated from an alcoholic solution poured into a large quantity of water, scatters light of a [MASK] tint.
the light scattered from small particles is of a much richer [MASK] than the blue of the first order as reflected from a very thin plate.
the general conclusion would appear to be that, while as seen from the earth's surface much of the light from the sky is due to comparatively gross suspended matter, yet an appreciable proportion is attributable to the molecules of air themselves, and that at high elevations where the [MASK] is purer, the latter part may become predominant.
ordinary observation of the landscape shows that there is another part, highly variable from day to day, and due to suspended matter, much of which is fine enough to scatter light of [MASK] quality.

in other respects the hirado factories do not produce wares nearly so beautiful as those manufactured there between 1759 and 1840, when the hirado-yakz stood at the head of all japanese porcelain on account of its pure, close-grained pate, its lustrous milk-white glaze, and the soft clear [MASK] of its carefully executed decoration.
at the industrial exhibition in rioto ware ~, (1895) the first results of their efforts were shown, owari attracting attention at once, in medieval times owari was celebrated for faience glazes of various colors, much affected by the tea-clubs, but its staple manufacture from the beginning of the 19th century was porcelain decorated with [MASK] under the glaze, the best specimens of which did not approach their chinese prototypes in fineness of pdte, purity of glaze or richness of color.

kiera followed as evelyn turned toward the main house, a sprawling, single-story compound made of brilliant [MASK] stone and dotted with hundreds of glass-less windows.

kiera lay on the bed an hour after evelyn left, staring at the [MASK] ceiling with its brightly corded edges.
a'ran, assuming his sisters could handle the newest member of their family, turned and started toward the [MASK] dwelling before him.
they walked a short distance to an open atrium in the center of the house, complete with a small oasis rising up from [MASK] stone and curved benches.
unlike the cheerful [MASK] walls of the house, the tall wall was the unwelcome shade of dark grey that she'd begun to despise after days in the spaceships surrounded by it.
there were rows of grey chairs and several [MASK] benches in the rear, a handful of tables next to yawning windows, and a wall of what looked like constellation maps.
a'ran said nothing, though he clenched the arms of his chair hard enough for his knuckles to turn [MASK].
another was hunch-backed and dressed in heavy robes despite the heat of the day, and a third man barely taller than her had [MASK] irises and silvering hair.

they nearly reached the women's wing when the strange little council member with [MASK] eyes called out to her.
her eyes welled with tears, and she ducked her head, turning [MASK], then red.
kiera looked around, speechless at the soaring ceilings, the atrium with a waterfall in the foyer, and pristine [MASK] walls covered with the multi-colored roping.
she had changed to the [MASK] dress, the one she'd worn to dinner that night and the hem touched the tops of her bare feet, which pointed downward.
the silk cord was fastened to the brass gas lamp that centered the ceiling of the room, the other end tightly knotted about her soft [MASK] neck.
i think the gal in my dream was wearing the same [MASK] dress he sold you.
she wore [MASK] slacks, an emerald-green silk blouse and high-heeled shoes.
cynthia cooked something quick and italian for dinner, small [MASK] things that looked as they would suddenly explode into butterflies, given sufficient time.
the [MASK] dress scarcely touched the tops of her bare feet and fitted her perfectly.
edith looked up, rubbed a sleeve across her eyes to dry them, then brushed her hands down the [MASK] dress, smoothing the fabric against her legs.
looks like annie had a few good meals since she fit into that [MASK] dress, wouldn't you say?
once more, she wore annie quincy's [MASK] dress.
she stopped and smiled, holding out the edges of her [MASK] dress as if to show it off.
when dean answered it, edith shipton stood there, still clad in the [MASK] dress, that she now owned.
but it was august and that river isn't exactly world-class [MASK] water.

are you blowing your nose or waving a [MASK] flag?
edith passed by, dressed in civies, her beloved [MASK] dress temporarily put aside.
she was dressed in [MASK]....
it probably was edith shipton in her [MASK] dress.
dean brushed off a [MASK] cloud of flour and greeted a well-dressed, good-looking man in his late forties standing in the hall.
edith shipton's jaw dropped and a panicked look spread across her [MASK] face.
dean dreamed of [MASK]-dressed hookers smiling and calling to a line of seven little miners who looked suspiciously like snow white's benefactors.
at least she wasn't wearing the annie quincy [MASK] dress.
"the [MASK] dress, blonde hair and her trying to emulate annie quincy...it frightens me," cynthia said with a shudder.
take off the rose colored glasses—'my sins will continue'—or better yet, wait until you decipher a few more pages and she gives it to you in black and [MASK], chapter and verse and supplies the sinful details.
as dean watched, scarcely breathing, she lifted the ancient [MASK] dress above her head in one motion and dropped it to the floor.
she was as [MASK] as the garment she now casually pushed with one foot behind a hall table.
the tall trees were draped in a [MASK] robe that had drifted to the earth, not snarled their way downward like the wind driven eastern storms where snow was a dirty word, not the magical hush that mother nature bestowed on the mountains of the west.
miss annie's pretty much spelled it out in black and [MASK] in this here journal, even if it was in code.
as it tolled its final gong, edith shipton appeared, in her late night attire— the annie quincy [MASK] dress—her hair loosened about her shoulders.
once beyond access to the river below, the seldom-used path presented an unbroken cover of fresh [MASK], now blanketed in more than a foot of fresh powder, as it followed the large pipe toward the reservoir.

he informed dean the climbers, who were due to check out later, had left for the ice park, grumbling at the heavy accumulation of snow which was abating to a last-ditch flurry after depositing thirty inches of fluffy [MASK].

crumpled in the waste paper basket was a small piece of [MASK] paper with a telephone number.

thursday's storm had roared into town with uncommon severity, bringing with it not only more than two feet of fresh snow, but a wind that set the [MASK] stuff a-dancing and swirling about the town, like a wild rhumba or some native fertility rite.
she's just sitting in the room, in her [MASK] dress.
the headlights of a slow moving car washed her [MASK] body, shadowing the curve of her buttocks, the roundness of her shoulder, painting her golden hair in its light.
dean made a move toward her, but she scurried out the door with a loud laugh, still naked, dragging her [MASK] dress behind her.
she had tied the silk cord to the brass gas lamp at the ceiling in the center of the room, before knotting the other end about her soft [MASK] neck.
it was on plain [MASK] notepaper, lined and firmly creased, written somewhat shakily with an ink pen, in the dainty script of a woman.
mrs. shipton was packaged a little loosely to start with, so the [MASK] dress and her being pregnant and all just pushed her all the further.
she mimicked annie from the beginning—wearing the [MASK] dress—dying her hair—candles in the room.
then she added, "did edith wear her [MASK] dress when she came to...your bed?"
"she had the [MASK] dress with her," he answered, embarrassed.
that's more of a stretch than trying to fit gladys turnbull in annie's [MASK] dress.
between bites he added, i even brought the [MASK] dress.
one of them bundles says it's mrs. shipton's stuff but all it has in it is the [MASK] dress.
you thought it went to the hospital, in a pocket of the [MASK] dress.
"why would edith put the [MASK] dress back on but no underwear?" he asked.
"she put the [MASK] dress on because she was annie quincy when she died," cynthia said.
edith didn't have anything on but the [MASK] dress.
he must have put annie quincy's [MASK] dress on her.
annie's [MASK] dress would easily slip over her head.
"i'll leave donnie's problems for the guys in [MASK] coats to sort it out," dean answered.
he turned, looking over the back of the sofa and there she stood in a plush [MASK] robe with a towel on her head and yes, she definitely had a waddle to her walk.
it was pink with [MASK] tips, in an antique brass planter.
it was [MASK], the least showy.

that's why the kid is all [MASK].
the huge [MASK] dog lowered his head and bared his teeth at the stranger.
he cowered in the corner, clutching a [MASK] hen in his mouth.
the sky hung like a gray sheet over the [MASK] landscape and huge flakes continued to fall.

"i didn't know exactly … i didn't know when or what or …" she stopped, knuckles [MASK] as she gripped the edge of her t-shirt.
gabriel cursed under his breath.  he had no way of knowing what kind of test a deity like death could create, but it wasn't likely to be good.  while he had full faith in rhyn, he also knew better than to trust the petite woman in [MASK] standing in his dream.
"i welcome it," rhyn replied, facing the small woman with flowing [MASK] hair and gown.
she wore [MASK] and smiled, more like a nursemaid than the woman whose job was to collect souls.
"you're so [MASK]," ivy said, scaring me from the doorway.
yeah, but you're really [MASK].
i shrugged and said, "i burn easily…because i'm so [MASK]."
he had awakened a few moments before the usual time, ordinarily a good sign, but after rubbing open his eyes, he discovered it was a [MASK] day, hazy and sultry, without a speck of blue in the sky.
[MASK] days weren't supposed to show up until at least july, certainly not in early may.
[MASK] days were always like that.
he has a black and [MASK] sense of right and wrong.
the late spring sun had finally fought its way out of the [MASK] haze and was slipping down in the west, painting the countryside in yellow brush strokes.
[MASK] days and philadelphia had that effect.
small talk progressed to let's-go-someplace-else and before dean knew it, he was between ethel rosewater's [MASK] silk sheets.
there was also a small sheet of [MASK] paper listing 11.2 gallons of gas purchased in aberdeen, maryland, a mileage figure and the amount of the purchase.
i'd have my [MASK] hat on but it was still dark when i dressed.
she took a plain sheet of [MASK] paper from her desk and proceeded with flying fingers to type the 14 names and addresses using an old manual typewriter.
the trail dead-ended at a faded [MASK] house at the edge of a clearing that commanded a view of the val­ley below.
the little girl was a beauty: her blond curls were pinned with a bright red ribbon and her [MASK] dress had a red sash about the waist.
the attendant ushered them into a sterile room of [MASK] tile and stainless steel.
the corpse was covered with a [MASK] sheet, but before pulling the cloth back, the attendant again looked at cynthia, who nodded.
the body looked like a flipped fish—a huge [MASK] under belly.
he maneuvered her arms out of her jacket and [MASK] frilly blouse.
he then draped a second towel across the lower part of her body and removed her panties, no "thursday" cotton things, but small and [MASK].
what was supposed to be sunshine, mild temperature and puffy [MASK] clouds turned out to be intermittent showers and a sky as gray as dean's sweat socks.
dean asked her about the motor home but she could give lit­tle information except to say it was boxy looking and blue...or [MASK]...or light colored.
his expression went [MASK].
she opened her pocketbook and pulled out a [MASK] envelope and thrust it at dean.
a short stocky man in a [MASK] t-shirt and matching sneakers jabbed a hand at alex.
the filly was mostly [MASK] with a few brown spots – almost the opposite of her mother.

she showered and put on a [MASK] sundress with a full skirt and spaghetti straps.
alex drove his [MASK] dodge truck home and she followed him in her new white buick le sabre feeling equal amounts of joy and guilt.
a [MASK] truck pulled into the yard but josh didn't look that way.
that evening she prepared a special supper for alex and dressed in the [MASK] sundress he liked so well.
the sight of the [MASK] dodge ram truck threw her pulse into high gear.
the [MASK] sandal heels gave the ensemble a dressy look.
the box contained a pair of earrings - delicate filigree in [MASK] gold with sparkling diamonds.
the earrings would go well with her [MASK] lace and satin wedding dress – and her wedding ring, of course.
the wedding ring was [MASK] gold filigree with tiny diamonds.
through the living room window carmen saw a [MASK] truck slow down to pull in the drive.
tables were covered with [MASK] linen table cloths and adorned with violet colored napkins inside light gray napkin holders.

that evening she was fixing supper when she glanced out the window in time to see a [MASK] truck pull up at her house.
his teeth were [MASK] in the reflection of the flashlight.
like pieces of [MASK] glitter, frost winked back at the sun from the grass and the top of the old farmhouse.
the [MASK] block walls of the dairy remained solid, but the windows were dark.
a [MASK] wisp of fog was the only clue that it was actually warmer than the crisp march morning.
the [MASK] appaloosa would be three years old in july.

[MASK] tailed deer, as well as an abundance of smaller wildlife already frequented the ranch, so his north american safari had its foundation.
the rabbit leaped into the air, and bolted across the field, his [MASK] tail visible above the tall grass with each bound.
a thin [MASK] line formed around his lips.
his hands were balled into fists at his sides and the knuckles were [MASK].
something [MASK] glistened in the flowers.
as she walked out with the full cup, she noticed alex talking to a man in a [MASK] smock.
the [MASK] god, darian, strode through his marble halls, the soft footfalls of his leather boots the only sound in the imperial corridor.
the eldest of any of the [MASK] gods to mate, he'd been lauded with celebrations for days upon the announcement that he'd chosen a bride.
the [MASK] god heard the note of sadness.
their betrothal was short by [MASK] god standards, a matter of six days.
she's not of much use to the [MASK] god.
he had a streak of honor that marked him the son of a [MASK] god as much as his golden eyes.
they passed the obelisk marked with the [MASK] god's lineage.
i'm the [MASK] god.
i trust you more than anyone, jule, but these rumors of wars between immortals have been around for three generations of [MASK] gods.
no [MASK] god has fallen in the history of our worlds.
no one would stand in the way of a [MASK] god, even an abusive, power-hungry father.
the [MASK] god fell into a heap.
only a member of the [MASK] god's family can kill him.
slay the [MASK] god, slay the balance.
he walked like he was the [MASK] god, with confidence and command.
she recognized the necklace that marked darian as the [MASK] god.
he leaned over to her and yanked off the necklace marking her as the mate of the [MASK] god.
she walked through the gateway and imagined herself as important as the [MASK] god walking into his palace.
"they heard how the [MASK] god's mate slept her way to the top then landed a god," another snickered.
only the sons of a [MASK] god had eyes the color of amber!
the only guardians in existence are now in the mortal realm, and you are now the [MASK] god.
the people around her—the [MASK] god she was sworn to serve as a guardian—needed her.
she felt the sudden urge to run again, as far as she could from her past, talia's death, the bleak future of the [MASK] god and his guardians.
"your fate is with the [MASK] god, jenn," the watcher said.
your fate is with the [MASK] god, jenn.
if she didn't make it out of here, she'd at least go down serving the guardians and the [MASK] god.
darian walked down the hall and stairwell to the study where his brother, the [MASK] god damian, was probably plotting how to outsmart the pesky little immortals who'd declared war on them.
darian watched his little brother, at once proud of the [MASK] god that damian had grown into and crushed by the sense of his own failure.
he'd begun to remember his life as the [MASK] god, memories that had been trapped in darkness for so long.
how does the [MASK] god get put on babysitting duty?
he'd expected the grey god's powers to be like the [MASK] god's, yet they weren't.
although he couldn't do everything he'd been able to do as a [MASK] god, he'd gained other abilities.
more importantly, she had to find out what jonny's next step was, once the month-long truce between [MASK] and black gods was up.
the [MASK] gods had a long tradition of finding and mating with oracles.
"he's better suited to be the [MASK] god than i ever was," darian said.
i believe damian has a hunter among his men, but the [MASK] god refuses to speak to me anymore.
tucson, arizona near the [MASK] god's former headquarters
he approached what had been one of many former safe houses belonging to the [MASK] god near the base of the tucson mountains.
"bianca!" the [MASK] god bellowed into the hallway.
while she'd been one of the original guardians to escape the immortal world with damian, she'd also been at the bottom of the totem pole, once the guardians in the mortal world rallied around their [MASK] god.
jenn stepped away but felt the [MASK] god watching her.
jenn waited until he disappeared as he traveled to the [MASK] god's headquarters.
but he seemed calmer than the [MASK] god, more driven.
her mate, the [MASK] god damian, sat with his adopted brothers, the assassin dusty and the original immortal jule.
"nope," the [MASK] god replied.
the [MASK] god hadn't said a word, until requesting a hostage of his own in exchange for sending his brother to live with the black god.
if all was as it used to be, at one end of the orchard was the [MASK] god's palace, a place a woman raised as a peasant had never seen.
one eye still glowed gold, the telltale sign of those born into the [MASK] god's family.
her gaze flickered towards the other end of the orchard, where the [MASK] god's palace had been.
that was probably the worst lesson for someone who was a [MASK] god.
no one was in the [MASK] god's study.
as the [MASK] and black gods of this earth, you are bound by the requirement to turn the violator over to us.
"damian," jonny said, turning to the [MASK] god, "i will not object if you wish to turn her over to them."
the [MASK] god winked at him, and darian resisted the urge to snort.
darian asked, stepping into the center of the room beside the [MASK] and black gods.
darian smiled, doubting the [MASK] god would remotely agree with the two women before him but proud of them nonetheless.
she'd killed one [MASK] god and been killed by another.
it was pristine and [MASK], rising out of the ground like a natural formation.
in his time as [MASK] god, the obelisk had been the source and seat of power for the white gods in the immortal world.
damian's son would be the first [MASK] god born outside of the immortal world, and not even jule dared to guess what that would mean for the white god's power.
it was so before the schism, when the [MASK] god took an oracle as his bride and was himself betrayed.
as the [MASK] god, he was sworn to protect humanity.
i'm here because it's the will of the [MASK] god.
she wore the mark of darian, the firstborn of the [MASK] god.
sofi wore the [MASK] god's pendant, bianca wore dusty's mark, and yully wore jule's.
you're not a [MASK] god.
unlike you, a [MASK] god had some choice in who he took as a mate.
she was proud of what she'd done, how she'd beaten the [MASK] god.
the lives of the [MASK] god's mate, and her best friend's mate, were in her hands.
she didn't expect her life to change quite so fast or to be accepted into the [MASK] god's family with such ease.
even carrying a [MASK] god, jenn couldn't explain sofi's pregnancy accelerating so fast, unless …"wait, exactly how long have you been here?"
she's no longer your sister, not when she serves the [MASK] god.
memories of a time when he'd been happy as the [MASK] god with his oracle at his side.
it radiated power, the seat of the [MASK] god's magic.
she touched her name, leaving bloodied streaks on the [MASK] marble.
[MASK] lightning snaked through the air.
magic shot off him in bursts of black and [MASK] lightning.
they burst into [MASK] flames.
[MASK] fire spewed from the ground upward, towards the sky.
damian studied him, the [MASK] god's power swirling in the space between them.
taran stepped into a cavernous bedchamber lit by low burning hearths and scented by the [MASK] flowers sitting in each window.
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of [MASK] tents were neatly aligned outside the wall.
[MASK] and black feathered arrows suddenly poured from the surrounding forest.
he watched the massive [MASK] cliffs grow closer, awed by their size.

if you had called these sensations respectively [MASK] and white, he would have adopted them as readily; but he would mean by black and white the same things that he means by sweet and sour.
at length the wind rose, the mist increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher than before, half out of water, a hundred [MASK] points, three inches long, at once above the surface.
looking farther, i was surprised to find that the chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a duellum, but a bellum, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted against the [MASK], and frequently two red ones to one black.
one [MASK] chicken which the administrator could not catch, black as night and as silent, not even croaking, awaiting reynard, still went to roost in the next apartment.

edelweiss serves a traditional selection including apple streudel and [MASK] forest cake.
having come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the [MASK] field up the hillside.
at first she heard only metivier's voice, then her father's, then both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open, and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivier with his shock of [MASK] hair, and the prince in his dressing gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards.
the fire died down for a moment and wreaths of [MASK] smoke rolled from under the roof.
the restaurant has a tempting display case of beautifully decorated desserts, such as the [MASK] forest cake.

wash your burger down with a shake; flavors include vanilla bean, dark chocolate, mango, pistachio, coffee, [MASK] and white, coconut, and cola.
denisov was a small man with a red face, sparkling [MASK] eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair.
the [MASK], hairy, snub-nosed face of vaska denisov, and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he was only redder than usual.
the night was dark but starry, the road showed [MASK] in the snow that had fallen the previous day--the day of the battle.
corn seasoned with red bell peppers and [MASK] beans made a colorful vegetable.
the [MASK] car sat outside the building with its trunk open.
i started the dairy and everything i had went into getting it into the [MASK].
maybe so, but there have been many people attacked by bears - mostly [MASK] bears.
everything around her started to spin and then went [MASK].
more likely so they can stay in the [MASK].
there were three bedrooms but the largest one, presumably belonging to howie, was located in the rear of the house where it remained pitch [MASK].
light strobed through cracks in the boards, and the sidewalks teemed with shady-looking characters dressed all in [MASK].
even the pictures on the wall were [MASK] and white photography in black frames.
there was an alarm clock on the nightstand beside the [MASK] base of a lamp.
[MASK] furniture, white carpets, black granite countertops in the kitchen, white walls and cabinets.
sunny was [MASK] and white, just like the rest of dusty's world.
a tall, toned woman who looked like she did pilates for a living stood in the hall in tight [MASK] leather pants and a tight pink t-shirt that drew attention to her large breasts.
and the fact the [MASK] god wanted her.
there was no such thing as a good [MASK] god, and jonny would be no exception.
he returned to the house to await darian, not surprised to see bianca's [MASK] and white cat darting down the stairs.
her breath caught as she saw talon leaning against a [MASK] car.
the devil's cold dark eyes flared and turned [MASK].
you see the [MASK] clouds?
the frozen sea beneath her feet was the color of tar, the [MASK] clouds above paused mid-swirl around a pop of blue sky in the storm's center.
and still the [MASK] god walked.
"we wait," the [MASK] god replied.
talon watched the [MASK] god go.
it wasn't the [MASK] god.
"it's time," the [MASK] god said over his shoulder.
his eyes turned [MASK], fathomless, and she knew whatever creature possessed the human body was loosening its grip on its powers.
the world dumped her on top of a pile of sand near the boardwalk with the angry [MASK] sea roaring behind her.
his eyes were closer to normal, swirling [MASK] spheres.
he took in the various scenes, to include the local news, which blasted photos of the [MASK] skies and mounting waves of the tropical-storm-turned-hurricane.
the [MASK] god's there?
the [MASK] god held out his hands.
he'd been jogging for an hour when a [MASK] tahoe pulled up alongside him.
dusty glanced up at the sky, where the clouds had gone from [MASK] to slate.
the [MASK] god turned at his approach.
jonny's brown eyes, now [MASK], traveled past dusty to damian.
he said there's a new [MASK] god.
his hair was long and [MASK], braided down his back.
jule sat with his back against the far wall, his lip bloodied, one eye [MASK], and his hands chained above his head to the pipes running from the floor to the ceiling.
the new [MASK] god?
the gangly youth before him had dyed his hair from platinum back to its natural color of [MASK].
the [MASK] god's gaze turned sharp.
"then what do you want?" the [MASK] god asked.
the [MASK] god wasn't able to take his eyes off her.
damian called to the [MASK] god.
a blur of [MASK] shot between her and the attacker.
the [MASK] god nodded.
"her brother's the [MASK] god," darian said out of nowhere.
i can do things damian and the [MASK] god can't.
only two forms and a body draped in [MASK] remained on the cliff side.
he was tightly wrapped in [MASK] fabric, his head towards the ocean.
one of her eyes was [MASK] from a blow, and the sight infuriated him.
he was dressed in [MASK], and his chiseled features and striking blue eyes were perfect enough to have been sculptured.
he changed into all [MASK] and strapped a sword to his back before closing his eyes and envisioning the interior of nova sector.
unlike the others dressed for a white tie event, he was dressed in leather pants with a tight [MASK] pearl jam t-shirt, his hair braided, a chain from his spiked belt to his wallet, and heavy black boots.
he opened the windows, which did little to shed light into the stone room with its masculine, [MASK] décor.
even now, her heart quickened and her thoughts raced to the image of him in tight [MASK] clothing.
damian had a lot of cars, and she found the [MASK] bmw whose lights flashed when she clicked the key fob.
damian pulled off his sweater to reveal a [MASK] t-shirt and tucked weapons into his cargo pants, boots, and pockets.
she stayed the urge to curl up in her chair, jumping when a shadow with lopsided shoulders emerged from the corner dressed like an executioner in [MASK] hood and gloves.
if she closed her eyes, she would see the [MASK] memories crossing through his mind, but she allowed him his privacy.
he was dressed again all in [MASK], a color that should have minimized his size but just amplified how ripped he was beneath the clothing.
he sensed the visions in her head, not surprised to see his own [MASK] memories playing on the screens on the back of her eyelids along with a dark nightmare of a man in a corner crying.
it wrenched open, and a man in a [MASK] trench coat damian's size looked her over once.
shadows chased her up the stairs and flew down the halls, coating the floors and walls in shallow, [MASK] fog.
he drew away from her, and she met his [MASK] gaze.
pierre was beyond handsome with his brooding looks, wind-swept blond hair, [MASK] clothing, and trench coat.
[MASK] isn't supposed to do that.
as he pulled on the last of his clothes and crossed to his armory, a small, [MASK] velvet box nestled between two daggers drew his attention.
several cars were on fire, and [MASK] smoke spiraled toward the sky.
deep holes in the ground, rimmed with [MASK], pockmarked the shallow valley.
the large man in [MASK] with lopsided shoulders and an executioner's hood pressed himself into a corner.
though she wasn't hungry, she drank, exploring the [MASK] curtain shielding his memories as she did.
"as soon as he's done, we'll start working on you," the [MASK] god promised.
"i've been right here!" she said, shoving at him and his [MASK] memories.
the [MASK] god looked from her towards the direction of the voice.
"two, bring her," the infuriated [MASK] god ordered.
she sobbed, absorbing the [MASK] visions spilling through his mind.
pierre gripped each of their arms and led them toward two [MASK] tahoes.
he understood that the [MASK] god can never truly kill the white god for fear of unleashing the original beings, who would crush him.
damian closed his eyes in pain, unable to shake his brother's [MASK] history.
the [MASK] god doesn't share our view.
a look around her bedchamber with its [MASK], stone walls, ceiling and floor revealed nothing remotely edible.
her room was made of [MASK] stone and quiet with no sounds except the crackle of fire.
made of material softer than silk, the [MASK] dress she wore pooled at the top of her feet.
deidre continued through the halls lined with torches bearing [MASK] flames.
it was hunched over a book large enough to cover half the [MASK] stone desk at which it sat.
a small hourglass with [MASK] sand was in his palm.
unable to exit the dream fully, deidre had no concept of how long they stood before the [MASK] flames of the fire.
fevered and shivering, she felt too weak and hungry to focus well, but the shape of the [MASK] hourglass was unmistakable.
she had two markings on her back: one burgundy, the familiar immortal mating tattoo, and the new one [MASK], positioned directly beneath the original.
have you ever seen the web of a [MASK] widow?
in truth, destiny is like the web of a [MASK] widow.
his [MASK] eyes saw through her; his cold features were expressionless.
the landing overlooked the parched desert surrounding the [MASK] fortress.
his [MASK] eyes scoured her features and lingered on her lips.
a [MASK] cave yawned open before her.
the air was hot and dry, the two suns too dim to shed much light into the [MASK] fortress.
death was a dark, towering, muscular figure in the living area of her apartment, clothed in [MASK] and wearing an expression that mirrored what she felt.
she gave him another smile and turned away, retreating through the [MASK] portal.
he wore [MASK] pants that hugged his lower body to reveal the lean hips and long, muscular legs.
a flare of interest was in darkyn's [MASK] gaze, one that made her realize he wasn't leaving until he was finished with her.
the light of the [MASK] fire was too dim for her to see much more than the outline of his form.
it dissipated into [MASK] smoke in his hands.
except that, on his body, it was her name written in [MASK].
she possessed a head of coal [MASK] hair, tied in a single braid that extended below her waist, dark eyes, and a smile that lit up the room.
he couldn't imagine any childhood taunting that would have caused him to crawl into the earth through a cold, wet, and [MASK] hole.
the timing was propitious, as [MASK] clouds had begun to roll up the valley and gather above them, the advance guard of a summer shower.
thunder tumbled down the san juan mountains, heralding the arrival of pelting rain that turned the jeep road into a surging stream and the sky to an ominous shade of raven [MASK].
that would be a hoot, pushing my cart in a [MASK] cape!
dean bumped into pumpkin green, who was leaving, a [MASK] cape and tuxedo over his arm.
pumpkin held up the hanger, his outfit draped like [MASK] robed judge.
i'm leaving my [MASK] hose at home.
the attorney quickly recovered and half slid, half ran down the slope next to his jeep where they were standing, covering his shiny [MASK] shoes with dust in the process and nearly falling on the seat of his creased shorts.
she glanced down at the [MASK] abyss before them.
her trousers were [MASK] with mud front and back, her pant leg torn, and her left knee bloody.
beneath folded boxer shorts, but not well hidden, rested a [MASK] revolver.
dean ordered a cup of [MASK] kona.
when dean arrived in the hall, he was met by two men in [MASK] and his political opponent, seymour fitzgerald.
fat man in [MASK] stifled a laugh while the acting sheriff glowered.
he was a big [MASK] guy—that was the only description.
the [MASK] man, the passenger spotted in the stolen buick, had been apprehended when he returned to the vehicle to retrieve his overnight satchel.
his [MASK] eyes saw through wynn.
just under seven feet tall and muscular, he wore all [MASK] with weapons strapped to various parts of his body.
the portal to his underworld was grey; only yellow mortal portals and the [MASK] one to hell were visible.
she pushed at the [MASK] wall again, wanting to remember.
he was like a massive shadow among the sunny forest, dressed all in [MASK] and armed as if for battle, even when coming to see her.
a head taller than her, he was lean and calm, his [MASK] eyes missing nothing.
i remembered how you acted when you saw me in the [MASK] underwear.
yeah, that was probably said by someone who didn't have a big sow [MASK] bear after them.
the man standing in the weedy area of the lot was tall and thick, dressed in a trench coat, [MASK] clothing and heavy boots.
the eyes that once turned from [MASK] to white to every color in between were now blue-green in color, and her face held a human flush enhanced by his lovemaking.
his eyes were white then [MASK] then changed from every color in between, his brown hair of medium length and wavy, ruffled by the sea breeze.
they carried weapons, too, and their eyes were pure [MASK], their teeth pointed like jared's.
the flutter of a [MASK] trench coat blended with the dark sky as gabriel twisted them in midair, so he'd hit back first, with her protected in his arms.
there were no trench coats outside of the underworld he'd consider wearing, but he pulled on a soft [MASK] t-shirt and strapped a few sheaths to his body.
tall and lean, with eyes as [MASK] as gabriel's, the man who stood too close for her comfort wore normal enough clothing, aside from the knives strapped to his thighs.
his eye was [MASK], one of his cheekbones yellow.
as she watched, the [MASK] eye and bruised cheek healed themselves.
dressed in [MASK], he was an imposing figure, even in the cavernous room.
dressed all in [MASK] with weapons strapped in places identical to where gabriel wore his, the tall man was lean with cold eyes.
the muscular frame, [MASK] gaze, dark clothes all looked the same.
she stood on a covered landing of a fortress made of [MASK] stones overlooking a parched desert beneath dual suns too faded to provide anything other than indirect light.
it was dim inside the stronghold, and the first torch they crossed that burned with [MASK] flames mesmerized her long enough for her to lose sight of darkyn around a corner.
he led her past closed doors and through hallways carved out of [MASK] stone.
one opened it for him, and she trailed him into a large bedchamber complete with a hearth burning [MASK] flames.
it was muted [MASK], made out of material smoother than silk that draped over her arm like a second skin.
she changed out of her familiar clothing into the dress that matched the [MASK] world around her.
deidre opened her eyes and blinked rapidly, realizing the [MASK] she tried to clear from her sight was the black ceiling of the operating room.
the walls, however, were as [MASK] as the ceiling.
she wore the [MASK] dress still.
the only difference was her hair and the eyes that turned from white to [MASK] to every color in between.
she sat in a chair by the [MASK] hearth.
it gave off heat despite the [MASK] flames.
she was beautiful, a woman of sunshine, smiles, and eyes that changed from white to [MASK] and every color in between.
death held out her hand, and an hourglass with [MASK] sand appeared in her palm.
she tipped the hourglass, and [MASK] sand began to spill.
he went to the only portal that glowed [MASK] --the portal to hell --and stepped from the shadow world into the tiny, dark cell holding his friend.
when she felt ready to snap, the [MASK] lady returned with the little boy in tow.
the [MASK] lady's tone left no imagination to what she thought of the latest deadbeat mom in her office.
he was tall and clothed in all [MASK], ominous and large against the slate sky.
the man in [MASK] approached.
she stepped back even more and clenched the purse to her body, distracted as a sleek [MASK] car pulled up to the curb.
she took one more look at the ominous man in [MASK] and the sword at his hip and followed, shaking from more than cold.
katie instinctively believed her and twisted, staring with toby at the man in [MASK] who watched them drive away.
she felt the cold, [MASK] glare and fought the urge to run back inside the clinic.
he was in [MASK], unaffected by the cold or the light settling over him, outlining him like glitter on black construction paper.
toby had drawn him on [MASK] construction paper with silver glitter outlining the shape of a man.
her mind cleared, and she wiped her eyes at the massive form in [MASK] before her.
he was close to seven feet tall, with chiseled features and eyes as [MASK] as eternity.
his eyes glowed darker than night, two [MASK] holes in his otherwise indistinguishable face.
he was muscular and tall, clothed in dark jeans, a snug grey t-shirt that hugged his biceps and stretched across his chest and back and then sagged at his slender torso and hips, and a round [MASK] medallion that fell from his t-shirt as he leaned over her.
he shook the hand of his brother and friend, whose [MASK] skin clashed with his.
it was three months' salary, though hannah had added it to the [MASK] amex her fiancé paid in full every month without a second thought.
andre's apartment was [MASK] and fiery.
his eyes were [MASK] and empty, his frame small and wiry.
her air supply cut off, she tore at the hand holding her until the skin on his arm fell away to reveal smooth, [MASK] skin more akin to a reptile's than a human's.
he made his way through the castle with the [MASK] stones as he had many times during his long stay.
sasha was waiting for him in his study, sitting beside a fireplace that burned with [MASK] flames.
his gaze took in sasha before sliding to the [MASK] flames.
she followed, startled, only to see a massive [MASK] bird the size of a pterodactyl coasting along the tops of the waves.
katie faced him and saw that he was dressed like gabriel, all in [MASK].
she sat on the river bank across from a series of wide, large steps leading up a hill to the park where the arch stood, framed against a [MASK] sky.
the only brother not to declare outright war on him, kiki was a distant second to andre in his tepid support of their [MASK] sheep of a young brother.
he wore his customary all [MASK], his dark eyes hidden behind dark shades.
he wore all [MASK], though he was dressed more simply than she'd seen him, in dark jeans and a black long-sleeved t-shirt and heavy boots.
there were wide eighteenth- century ball gowns, women in little [MASK] dresses, one in a fifties poodle skirt, and several in dark dresses with ornate brocade on the bodice, like that of wealthy middle age royalty.
his [MASK] gaze was still visible in the dark living room.
another wild adventure by the [MASK] sheep of a sister that was dear hannah's.
rhyn emerged from the shadows near the window, dressed in [MASK] with his hair tied back.
suddenly, a massive [MASK] jaguar leapt past her toward the nearest trail.
she turned and raised an eyebrow at him, her rainbow eyes flashing with every color between white and [MASK].
dressed all in [MASK] with his dark eyes and hair, he looked like a living shadow in the snow-covered world.
it was not all [MASK] but had a white patch around one eye.
the room consisted of a massive bed with [MASK] bedding and white pillows, a wardrobe and trunks, and yawning windows to the sky that light never touched.
and don't try to tell me that [MASK] cat wasn't you!
far across the sea, he saw the [MASK] walls of hell stretching from water to sky.
he gazed into the [MASK] flames of the fire in the hearth.
he trotted down a set of [MASK] lacquered stairs, an ipad tucked under one arm.
he didn.t stay to hear the splash this time but walked through the shadow world toward the only portal that glowed [MASK], the portal to hell.
a massive creature with [MASK] fur and fangs paused in front of the open door, sniffing the air.
the door exploded open in flames, wood, and [MASK] fur.
she.d never understand a man like kris, who saw the world only in [MASK] and white!
the [MASK] fortress and dark skies made her heart drop to her feet.
the demon was too surprised to react, and jade hacked him down until the [MASK] walls were sprayed with demon blood.
he reached into his pocket and withdrew a small [MASK] pouch, pouring its contents—two green gems holding the dust of human souls—into his palm.
she relaxed into the comfortable [MASK] desk chair in front of her computer, wondering if romas had told evelyn of the half a dozen kids he expected.
all she had to do was choose the color she wanted to wear-- [MASK] for the past several days in silent objection to her presence aboard the ship-- and the ship's computer wove it for her.
i see you're not wearing [MASK] today.
to them, she was an exotic little doll with her huge, gem-hued eyes, [MASK] hair, and toned hour-glass shape.
she interacted daily with the warrior members of her husband's family, but she'd never seen one quite like this, with soulful, ancient intelligence in his [MASK] gaze and a predatory walk.
the man a'ran fought was more than a foot taller, with light skin and [MASK] hair resembling one of the observers.
crashing into the planet left the left side of her torso [MASK] and bruised.
she touched her bruised cheekbone and realized doing so exposed her [MASK] and blue arm.
the warm sun had eaten most of the snow from the roadway, leaving a contrasting [MASK] ribbon, in places still snow-patched from last night's covering.
"the number six and nine lifts service most of the double [MASK] diamond runs," dean said to fred with a smile as the old man glided to a wide stop.
the [MASK] diamond expert trails were for the donald rylands of the world.
yes, but think of the sleigh bells and the sound of the train coming in from ridgway, clanking and hooting, and billowing its [MASK] smoke.
take off the rose colored glasses—'my sins will continue'—or better yet, wait until you decipher a few more pages and she gives it to you in [MASK] and white, chapter and verse and supplies the sinful details.
piano george said they lost two fine [MASK] horses that slipped on the ice of the sneffles road and i could hear the men talking loudly about it.
it was barely evening but the darkening clouds and winter season begrimed the outside as [MASK] as a slum landlord's heart.
miss annie's pretty much spelled it out in [MASK] and white in this here journal, even if it was in code.
ryland sported a [MASK] eye but, in spite of it, was smiling.
the pen has [MASK] ink in it now.
the last memory each held involved a man with eyes piercing and [MASK] as the night sky.
jackson recognized the [MASK] eyes as soon as they were leveled upon him.
his [MASK] hair appeared darker, thicker and shone as if coated in oil.
he wore [MASK] jeans, a dark gray versace silk sport shirt with the cuffs rolled up, and a pair of a. testoni loafers.
claudia chose a [MASK] valentino.
they were a soft, sable brown with specs of [MASK] that seemed to swirl in motion around her pupils like two tiny solar systems.
connor asked, "white or [MASK]?"
right, [MASK] it is.
her fur was lustrous and her nose looked like [MASK] velvet.
her eyes pierced through him, [MASK] as coal; all traces of warmth extinguished.
on the second ring, something sharp pierced the back of her neck and everything went [MASK].
i wish you'd get out of this [MASK] mood you've been in lately.
the engine turned over and backfired, [MASK] smoke frothing out of the tail pipe.
his [MASK] curly hair was cut short, every hair in place, and his angular jaws were freshly shaven.
those pans are all [MASK] on the bottom and...
and then everything went [MASK] again.
the narrow [MASK] highway ribboned smoothly down hill under a canopy of trees.
her gaze dropped to the driver's seat, where a small [MASK] military radio sat where none had been when she left the car.
the muscular woman, with short blond hair and clad in [MASK] tactical gear, stood in a stark white hallway.
george, i have a small [MASK] box about the size of your hand with nothing but a keypad in it.
he opened it and looked at the small [MASK] keypad a quarter the size of his palm.
she'd removed her personal identifiers, hacked into the government's tracking mainframe to deactivate the implant in her brain, and changed into the [MASK] tactical uniform elise brought her over her civilian grays.
"you don't look like a spec ops soldier," he said, referring to the [MASK] uniform elise insisted she wear.
he took each side of her collar and pulled, the effortless movement ripping the [MASK] uniform down the middle.
the man before her snatched one arm and flipped out a knife, cutting through her [MASK] clothing and tossing it aside.
her [MASK] uniform was clean and waiting for her.
soon after, the men in [MASK] mowed down two of dan's men, and the three of them were left to fend for themselves.
they were going into the [MASK] water, hundreds of feet beneath them.
the occupant of the large chair in the corner of the living room launched towards her in a flurry of brown and [MASK] fur.
tim stood in his [MASK] fed uniform, comfortable with the soldiers eyeing him.
several soldiers—two in grays and three in [MASK] uniforms—approached the bonfire, speaking with the men gathered in a group on one side.
two soldiers—one in [MASK] and one in gray—approached.
"welcome," the man in [MASK] said at last.
he was more intrigued by the sight of soldiers in pmf grays as well as those in the regular military's [MASK] uniforms.
more soldiers in gray and [MASK] made their way down the bonfires, pausing to talk to mike.
mike stopped finally in a chamber where two soldiers—one in [MASK] and one in gray—were dusting themselves off.
"at first, i think it was knowing he was a [MASK] sheep like me.  my sister always treated me like i was a blight on the family name.  she tried to help me in her own way, i guess, which was better than what rhyn's brothers did to him.  i wanted to believe he could make it in the immortal world, because if he could, i could, too," she started.
an hour glass with streaming [MASK] sand appeared in his palm.
rhyn crept carefully through the demon scouts positioned throughout the forest surrounding the castle.  the demons wore the dark one's uniform of all [MASK] with waterproof cloaks and hoods.  the demon side of him rendered his presence similar enough to a full-demon's that the others wouldn't be alarmed.  he sized up each demon he passed, until he found one who appeared to be his size.  the creature didn't hear his soft step, and the snapping of the demon's neck was the only other sound in the falling rain.
the water looked … [MASK] in the moonlight.  she took a step back and looked up towards the moons.  as gabriel indicated, one moon was lower than the other.
the sounds of fighting grew faint and then disappeared.  the stream wound through the jungle until it reached a small waterfall that fed into a massive lake whose [MASK] surface reflected the stars and moon.  katie slid down the hill beside the waterfall to the lake's edge, uncertain what to do.  gabriel hadn't mentioned the stream ending or the lake.
rhyn opened a portal and walked through the cool shadow place.  the shadow world felt … strange this time.  he looked around, unsettled by the sensation that someone else was there.  the [MASK] portal to hell throbbed then dimmed, as if someone and come through.
toby huddled against the [MASK] stone wall of his cell in hell.
rhyn awoke from the island dreamscape in the shadow world.  he rose, uncertain what happened but recalling his urgency.  he crossed through the glowing [MASK] portal into the one place he'd hoped never to see again: hell.  unwilling to get stuck in the cell where he'd spent many lifetimes, he chose to open the portal into the office of the council's betrayer, sasha.  the office was as he remembered it, down to the black flames in the hearth.
yes. and the man in [MASK] who used to visit you.
"i'm not sure.  i was at home when someone broke in.  i heard someone screaming then something hot went straight through me.  everything went [MASK], and i woke up here," the woman explained.
more thunder boomed.  katie wondered what other kinds of storms the underworld might have.  would it rain something other than [MASK] water?  with her luck, it'd rain bugs, like the beetle nest she skirted.
kris looked up in time to see kiki crash through the canopy and plummet towards the ground.  kris gasped and sprung forward.  a streak of [MASK] crossed his vision as a flying demon snatched kiki out of the air.
gabe and a few other assassins in [MASK] fought off hordes of demons.  surprised, rhyn launched into the melee with his dagger.  he slashed through several demons before the creatures realized he was there.  wanting to keep them off balance, he morphed into his demon form and shredded the creatures with talons and fangs as deadly as theirs.
the [MASK] sand had run out.  he'd missed his window.  rather, he missed this window.  he looked over at the demon standing before him.  at least one of his super-demons had survived.  this one still wore half a face, that of death's favorite assassin, gabriel.
gabe took the necklace, looking at the two emeralds on the [MASK] leather-like cord.  he'd missed his necklace after eons wearing it.  he'd missed his mother and baby brother.  he squeezed them in his hand in the only hug he could give his dead family.
gabe stepped closer to the lake.  even through the [MASK] water, he could see the green souls at the bottom.
i was wearing jeans and a [MASK] shirt.
his hair was a tad past barbering time and he wore polished [MASK] shoes and black socks, inconsistent with the rest of his attire.
"you be careful now," leo called after him, "it's pitch [MASK] over there on the beach."
when he could finally focus through the [MASK] of the night, he plodded forward, feet wallowing in the soft sand like a boat in a heavy sea.
he was slowly picking pieces of styrofoam flotsam from his early morning cup of [MASK] coffee.

the older optical glasses, now generally known as the " ordinary " crown and flint glasses, are all of the nature of pure silicates, the basic constituents being, in the case of crown glasses, [MASK] and soda or lime and potash, or a mixture of both, and in the case of flint glasses, lead and either (or both) soda and potash.
the power of resisting the disintegrating effects of atmospheric moisture and carbonic acid, depends largely upon the quantity of alkalis contained in the glass and their proportion to the lead, [MASK] or barium present, the stability being generally less the higher the proportion of alkali.
the materials ordinarily employed are the following: sand, of good quality, uniform in grain and free from any notable quantity of iron oxide; carbonate of [MASK], generally in the form of a pure variety of powdered limestone; and sulphate of soda.

a more important outcome, however, of italian influence was the production, in emulation of venetian glass, of a glass made of refined potash, [MASK] and sand, which was more colourless than the material it was intended to imitate.
the invention, if it may be regarded as one, consisted in eliminating [MASK] from the glass mixture, substituting refined potash for soda, and using a very large proportion of lead oxide.
mitscherlich prepared it in 1834 by distilling benzoic acid with [MASK]; and in 1845 hofmann discovered it in coal-tar.

quantity of [MASK] being increased at to exceed the sulphur, however.
they are neutral to litmus and do not combine with dilute acids or bases; strong bases, such as [MASK] and baryta, yield saccharates, whilst, under certain conditions, acids and acid anhydrides may yield esters.
in 1861 butlerow obtained a sugar-like substance, methylenitan, by digesting trioxymethylene, the solid polymer of formaldehyde, with [MASK].
loew, who prepared in 1885 a sweet, unfermentable syrup, which he named formose, c6h120e and, later, by using magnesia instead of [MASK], he obtained the fermentable methose.
like glucose it gives saccharates with [MASK], baryta and strontia.
as cold juice has a greater affinity for [MASK] than hot juice, it is best to treat the juice with lime when cold.
the requisite amount of milk of [MASK] set up at to° beaume is then added.
cream of [MASK] of 17° beaume is sometimes used, but the weaker solution is preferable, since the proper proportion is more easily adjusted.
these results are brought about by adding to the cold juice as it comes from the mill the proper proportion of milk of [MASK] set up at 8° b., and then delivering the limed juice in a constant steady stream as near the bottom of the defecator as possible; it is thus brought into immediate contact with the heating surface and heated once for all before it ascends, with the result of avoiding the disturbance caused in the ordinary defecator by pouring cold juice from above on to the surface of the heated juice, and so establishing down-currents of cold juice and up-currents of hot juice.
to make this apparatus more perfectly automatic, an arrangement for continually adding to and mixing with the juice the proper proportion of milk of [MASK] has been adapted to it; and although it may be objected that once the proportion has been determined no allowance is made for the variation in the quality of the juice coming from the mill owing to the variations that may occur in the canes fed into the mills, it is obviously as easy to vary the proportion with the automatic arrangement from time to time as it is to vary in each separate direction, if the man in charge will take the trouble to do so, which he very seldom does with the ordinary defecators, satisfying himself with testing the juice once or twice in a watch.
in diffusion plants the milk of [MASK] is added, in proper proportion, in the cells of the diffusion battery, and the chips or slices themselves act as a mechanical filter for the juice; while in the sandwich islands coral-sand filters have been employed for some years, in addition to the chips, to free the juice from impurities held in mechanical suspension.
this is a closed vessel, into which carbonic acid gas (produced as described hereafter) is forced, and combining with the [MASK] in the juice forms carbonate of lime.
the whole is then passed through filter presses, the clear juice being run off for further treatment, while the carbonate of [MASK] is obtained in cakes which are taken to the fields as manure.
the juice, which has now become comparatively clear, is again treated with [MASK], and again passed through a saturator and filter presses, and comes out still clearer than before.
it is then treated with sulphurous acid gas, for the purpose of decolorization, again [MASK]d to neutralize the acid, and then passed through a third saturator wherein all traces of lime and sulphur are removed.
a process for purifying and decolorizing the juice expressed from beetroots by the addition of a small quantity of manganate of [MASK] (20 to 50 grammes per hectolitre of juice), under the influence of an electric current, was worked with considerable success in a sugar factory in the department of seine-et-marne in the year 1900-1901.
a saving of 40% is stated to be effected in [MASK].
if by this process a more perfect defecation and purification of the juice is obtained, it will no doubt be highly beneficial to the cane p lanter, though no great economy in [MASK] can be effected, because but very little is used in a cane factory in comparison with the amount used in a beet factory.
the carbonic acid gas injected into the highly [MASK]d juice in the saturators is made by the calcination of limestone in a kiln provided with three cleaning doors, so arranged as to allow the lime to be removed simultaneously from them every six hours.
briefly, sugar-refining consists of melting raw or unrefined sugar with water into a syrup of 27° to 28° beaume, or 1230 specific gravity, passing it through filtering cloth to remove the sand and other matters in mechanical suspension, and then through animal charcoal to remove all traces of colouring matter and [MASK], thus producing a perfectly clear white syrup, which, cooked in the vacuum pan and crystallized, becomes the refined sugar of commerce.
the syrup in the cistern is allowed to remain for about twelve hours, by which time the char will have absorbed all the colouring matter in it, as well as the [MASK].
after the sweets have come away, cold water is passed through the char until no trace of [MASK] or sulphate of lime is found in it; then a large manhole at the bottom of the cistern is opened, and the washed and spent char is removed.
[MASK] of exceptionally good quality is burnt to a large extent in the neighbourhood, and forms an important article of trade; it is derived from the lower chalk formation.
it may be obtained from storax by distillation with water, and synthetically by heating cinnamic acid with [MASK], by the action of aluminium chloride on a mixture of vinyl bromide and benzene, by removing the elements of hydrobromic acid from bromethylbenzene by means of alcoholic potash, or, best, by treating (-bromhydrocinnamic acid with soda, when it yields styrolene, carbon dioxide and hydrobromic acid.
the a-halogen compounds are obtained by heating styrolene chloride (or bromide) with [MASK] or alcoholic potash; they are liquids which have a penetrating odour, and yield acetophenone when heated with water to 180°.
the soils overlying red sandstone rocks would be reddish and of a sandy nature, while those overlying chalk would be whitish and contain considerable amounts of [MASK].
7,600 „ [MASK] ..
it has long been known that when organic materials such as the dung and urine of animals, or even the bodies of animals and plants, are applied to the soil, the nitrogen within them becomes oxidized, and ultimately appears in the form of nitrate of [MASK], potash or some other base.
the presence of a base such as [MASK] or magnesia (or their carbonates) is also essential, as well as an adequate degree of moisture: in dry soils nitrification ceases.
it is the business of the farmer and gardener to promote the activity of these organisms by good tillage, careful drainage and occasional application of [MASK] to soils which are deficient in this substance.
carbonate of [MASK] is also a constituent to a greater or lesser extent in almost all soils.
pure carbonate of [MASK] when heated loses 44% of its weight, the decrease being due to the loss of carbon dioxide gas.
the resulting white product is termed calcium oxide [MASK], burnt lime, quicklime, cob lime, or caustic lime.
this substance absorbs and combines with water very greedily, at the same time becoming very hot, and falling into a fine dry powder,' calcium hydroxide or slaked [MASK], which when left in the open slowly combines with the carbon dioxide of the air and becomes calcium carbonate, from which we began.
when recommendations are made about liming land it is necessary to indicate more precisely than is usually done which of the three classes of material named above - chalk, quick[MASK] or slaked lime - is intended.
generally speaking the oxide or quick[MASK] has a more rapid and greater effect in modifying the soil than slaked lime, and this again greater than the carbonate or chalk.
[MASK] in whatever form it is applied has a many-sided influence in the fertility of the land.
the addition of small quantities of [MASK], especially in a caustic form, to stiff greasy clays makes them much more porous and pliable.
a lump of clay, which if dried would become hard and intractable, crumbles into pieces when dried after adding to it 2% of [MASK].
the [MASK] causes the minute separate particles of clay to flocculate or group themselves together into larger compound grains between which air and water can percolate more freely.
it is this power of creating a more crumbly tilth on stiff clays that makes [MASK] so valuable to the farmer.
[MASK] also assists in the decomposition of the organic matter or humus in the soil and promotes nitrification; hence it is of great value after green manuring or where the land contains much humus from the addition of bulky manures such as farm-yard dung.
this tendency to destroy organic matter makes the repeated application of [MASK] a pernicious practice, especially on land which contains little humus to begin with.
although good crops may follow the application of [MASK], the latter is not a direct fertilizer or manure and is no substitute for such.
[MASK] is a base and neutralizes the acid materials present in badly drained meadows and boggy pastures.
land which contains less than about z /c, of [MASK] usually needs the addition of this material.
the particular form in which [MASK] should be applied for the best results depends upon the nature of the soil.
in practice the proximity to chalk pits or [MASK] kilns, the cost of the lime and cartage, will determine which is most economical.
it contains a certain amount of unaltered caustic [MASK] and slacked lime, along with sulphates and sulphides of lime, some of which have an evil odour.
s i milarly soils can be improved by applying to them marl, a substance consisting of a mixture of clay with variable proportions of [MASK].
some of the chalk marls, which are usually of a yellowish or dirty grey colour, contain clay and 50 to 80% of carbonate of [MASK] with a certain proportion of phosphate of lime.
such a material would not only have an influence on the texture of the land but the [MASK] would reduce the sourness of the land and the phosphate of lime supply one of the most valuable of plant foodconstituents.
typical clay-marls are tenacious, soapy clays of yellowish-red or brownish colour and generally contain less than 50% of [MASK].
even stiff soils deficient in [MASK] are greatly improved in fertility by the addition of marls.
the demand for saltpetre as an ingredient of gunpowder led to the formation of saltpetre plantations or nitriaries, which at one time were common in france, germany, and other countries; the natural conditions were simulated by exposing heaps of decaying organic matter mixed with alkalies ([MASK], &c.) to atmospheric action.
wall-saltpetre or [MASK] saltpetre, calcium nitrate, ca(n03)2, is found as an efflorescence on the walls of stables; it is now manufactured in large quantities by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, i.e.
by passing a powerful electric arc discharge through moist air and absorbing the nitric acid formed by [MASK].
rejecting the old notion that plants derive their nourishment from humus, he taught that they get carbon and nitrogen from the carbon dioxide and ammonia present in the atmosphere, these compounds being returned by them to the atmosphere by the processes of putrefaction and fermentation - which latter he regarded as essentially chemical in nature - while their potash, soda, [MASK], sulphur, phosphorus, &c., come from the soil.
it can also be prepared by distilling meta-oxyuvitic acid with [MASK], or by the action of air on boiling toluene in the presence of aluminium chloride (c. friedel and j.
it may be prepared by the fusion of para-toluene sulphonic acid with potash; by the action of nitrous acid on para-toluidine; or by heating para-oxyphenyl acetic acid with [MASK].
the furnace used by henri moissan in his experiments on reactions at high temperatures, on the fusion and volatilization of refractory materials, and on the formation of carbides, suicides and borides of various metals, consisted, in its simplest form, of two superposed blocks of [MASK] or of limestone with a central cavity cut in the lower block, and with a corresponding but much shallower inverted cavity in the upper block, which thus formed the lid of the furnace.
alumina and [MASK], for example, which cannot be reduced at ordinary furnace temperatures, readily give up their oxygen to carbon in the electric furnace, and then combine with an excess of carbon to form metallic carbides.
8 a in the cavity of the [MASK] blocks.
when prolonged heating is required at very high temperatures it is found necessary to line the furnace-cavity with alternate layers of magnesia and carbon, taking care that the lamina next to the [MASK] is of magnesia; if this were not done the lime in contact with the carbon crucible would form calcium carbide and would slag down, but magnesia does not yield a carbide in this way.
in starting the furnace, the bottom is prepared by ramming it with charcoal-powder that has been soaked in milk of [MASK] and dried, so that each particle is coated with a film of lime, which serves to reduce the loss of current by conduction through the lining when the furnace becomes hot.

the alexandrians prepared oil of turpentine by distilling pine-resin; zosimus of panopolis, a voluminous writer of the 5th century a.d., speaks of the distillation of a "divine water" or "panacea" (probably from the complex mixture of calcium polysulphides, thiosulphate, &c., and free sulphur, which is obtained by boiling sulphur with [MASK] and water) and advises "the efficient luting of the apparatus, for otherwise the valuable properties would be lost."
prior to 1830, little was known of the process other than that organic compounds generally yielded tarry and solid matters, but the discoveries of liebig and dumas (of acetone from acetates), of mitscherlich (of benzene from benzoates) and of persoz (of methane from acetates and [MASK]) brought the operation into common laboratory practice.

murray and renard recognize the progressive diminution of carbonate of [MASK] with increase of depth as a characteristic of all eupelagic deposits.
murray and renard ascribe this to the greater abundance of carbonic acid in the deeper water, which aided by the increased pressure adds to the solvent power of the water for carbonate of [MASK].
the composition of the ash of true coal approximates to that of a fire-clay, allowance being made for [MASK], which may be present either as carbonate or sulphate, and for sulphuric acid.
clearer evidence of their occurrence has, however, been found in fragments of wood fossilized by silica or carbonate of [MASK] which are sometimes met with in coal seams.
before the commercial production of calcium carbide made it one of the most easily obtainable gases, the processes which were most largely adopted for its preparation in laboratories were: - first, the decomposition of ethylene bromide by dropping it slowly into a boiling solution of alcoholic potash, and purifying the evolved gas from the volatile bromethylene by washing it through a second flask containing a boiling solution of alcoholic potash, or by passing it over moderately heated soda [MASK]; and, second, the more ordinarily adopted process of passing the products of incomplete combustion from a bunsen burner, the flame of which had struck back, through an ammoniacal solution of cuprous chloride, when the red copper acetylide was produced.
wohler first made calcium carbide, and found that water decomposed it into [MASK] and acetylene.

magnesia was confounded with [MASK] until 1755, when j.
compounds embraced by the second definition are more usually termed hydroxides, since at one time they were regarded as combinations of an oxide with water, for example, calcium oxide or [MASK] when slaked with water yielded calcium hydroxide, written formerly as cao h 2 o.
the matrix is the [MASK] or cement, whose chemical action with the added water causes the concrete to solidify; and the aggregate is the broken stone or hard material which is embedded in the matrix.
the oldest of all the matrices is [MASK], and many splendid examples of its use by the romans still exist.
it has been to a great extent superseded by portland cement, on account of the much greater strength of the latter, though [MASK] concrete is still used in many places for dry foundations and small structures.
to be of service the [MASK] should be what is known as "hydraulic," that is, not pure or "fat," but containing some argillaceous matter, and should be carefully slaked with water before being mixed with the aggregate.
to ensure this being properly done, the lumps of [MASK] should be broken up small, and enough water to slake them should be added, the lime then being allowed to rest for about forty-eight hours, when the water changes the particles of quicklime to hydrate of lime, and breaks up the hard lumps into a powder.
the hydrated [MASK], after being passed through a fine screen to sort out any lumps unaffected by the water, is ready for concrete making, and if not required at once should be stored in a dry place.
when [MASK] is used as a matrix, certain natural earths such as pozzuolana or trass, or, failing these, powdered bricks or tiles, may be used instead of sand with great advantage.
they have the property of entering into chemical combination with the [MASK], forming a hard setting compound, and increasing the hardness of the resulting concrete.
in proportioning the quantities of matrix to aggregate the ideal to be aimed at is to get a concrete in which the voids or air-spaces shall be as small as possible; and as the [MASK] or cement is usually by far the most expensive item, it is desir able to use as little of it as is consistent with strength.
when natural flint gravel containing both stones and sand is used, it is usual to mix so much gravel with so much [MASK] or cement.
in hand mixing it is usual to measure out from gauge boxes the sand, stones and cement or [MASK] in a heap on a wooden platform.
for [MASK] concrete, and 1 to 5 cwt.
the same praise cannot, however, be given to [MASK] concrete.
even though the best hydraulic [MASK] be used it is wise to confine it to places where it is not exposed to the air, or to running water, and indeed for important structures the use of lime should be avoided.
good portland cement is so much stronger than any [MASK] that there are few situations where it is not cheaper as well as better to use the former, because, although cement is the more expensive matrix, a smaller proportion of it will suffice for use.
[MASK] should never be used in work exposed to sea-water, or to water containing chemicals of any kind.
the matter was carefully investigated, and it was found that the sulphate of magnesia in the sea-water has a decomposing action on portland cements, especially those which contain a large proportion of [MASK] or even of alumina.
but to ensure the permanence of structures in sea-water the great object is to choose a cement containing as little [MASK] and alumina as possible, and free from sulphates such as gypsum; and more important still to proportion the sand and stones in the concrete in such a way that the structure is practically non-porous.
others, like ford's silicate of [MASK]stone, are practically lime mortars of excellent quality, which can be carved and cut like a sandstone of fine quality.
boundary of the park there is a group of about 70 active springs, known as the mammoth hot springs, which hold carbonate of [MASK] in solution.
natural soils consist of substances derived from the decomposition of various kinds of rocks, the bulk consisting of clay, silica and [MASK], in various proportions.
argillaceous or clay soils are those which contain a large percentage (45-50) of clay, and a small percentage (5 or less) of [MASK].
loamy soils contain a considerable quantity (30-45%) of clay, and smaller quantities of [MASK], humus and sand.
manly soils are those which contain a considerable percentage (10-20) of [MASK], and are called clay marls, loamy marls and sandy marls, according as these several ingredients preponderate.
calcareous soils, which may also be heavy, intermediate or light, are those which contain more than 20% of [MASK], their fertility depending on the proportions of clay and sand which enter into their composition; they are generally cold and wet.
the chief point to be borne in mind in making these mixtures is not to combine in the same compost any bodies that are antagonistic in their nature, as for example [MASK] and ammonia.
in a natural state it is obtained from bones, guano and wood ashes; and in an artificial condition from basic slag or thomas's phosphate, coprolites and superphosphate of [MASK].
[MASK] in the caustic state is beneficially applied to soils which contain an excess of inert vegetable matter, and hence may be used for the improvement of old garden soils saturated with humus, or of peaty soils not thoroughly reclaimed.

at this season roses, grape vines and other plants are often affected by mildew; an effectual remedy is to paint the hot-water pipes with a mixture of sulphur and [MASK], put on as thick as ordinary whitewash, once each week until it is checked; but care must be taken not to apply it on any surface at a higher temperature than 212°.
in the carboniferous [MASK]stone series, the purer kinds of limestone are used for the manufacture of lime, bleaching powder and similar products, also as a flux in the smelting of iron; some of the less pure varieties are used in making cement.
thomas, who showed that, in the presence of a slag rich in [MASK], the whole of the phosphorus could be removed readily.
impurities.-the properties of iron and steel, like those of most of the metals, are profoundly influenced by the presence of small and sometimes extremely small quantities of certain impurities, of which the most important are phosphorus and sulphur, the former derived chiefly from apatite (phosphate of [MASK]) and other minerals which accompany the iron ore itself, the latter from the pyrite found not only in most iron ores but in nearly all coal and coke.
drops of slag props of iron layer of molten slag- -- --:€___ layer of molten iron--- * the ore and [MASK] actually exist here in powder.
[MASK] of the limestone and the ash of the fuel to form a complex molten silicate called the " cinder " or " slag."
of lron ore lumps of [MASK] - in the upper part of the furnace the carbonic oxide deoxidizes the iron oxide of the ore by such reactions as xco+fe02.
7) the solid matter has become so hot that the now deoxidized iron melts, as does the slag as fast as it is formed by the union of its three constituents, the gangue, the [MASK] resulting from the decomposition of the limestone and the ash of the fuel.
the desulphurizing effect of this transfer of the sulphur from union with iron to union with calcium is due to the fact that, whereas iron sulphide dissolves readily in the molten metallic iron, calcium;sulphide, in the presence of a slag rich in [MASK], does not, but by preference enters the slag, which may thus absorb even as much as 3% of sulphur.
the duty of the [MASK]stone (caco 3) is to furnish enough lime to form with the gangue of the ore and the ash of the fuel a lime silicate or slag of such a composition (1) that it will melt at the temperature which it reaches at about level a, of fig.
7, (2) that it will be fluid enough to run out through the cinder notch, and (3) that it will be rich enough in [MASK] to supply that needed for the desulphurizing reaction fes+ cao+c = fe+cas+co.
in order that the slag shall have these properties its composition usually lies between the following limits: silica, 26 to 35%; [MASK], plus i 4 times the magnesia, 45 to 55%; alumina, 5 to 20%.
of these the silica and alumina are chiefly those which the gangue of the ore and the ash of the fuel introduce, whereas the [MASK] is that added intentionally to form with these others a slag of the needed physical properties.
the poorer it is in iron, the more [MASK]stone must in general be added, and hence the more slag results, though of course an ore the gangue of which initially contains much lime and little silica needs a much smaller addition of limestone than one of which the gangue is chiefly silica.
in the basic bessemer process, also, unforeseen variations in the siliconcontent are harmful, because the quantity of [MASK] added should be just that needed to neutralize the resultant silica and the phosphoric acid and no more.
of these the first escapes immediately as a gas, and the others unite with iron oxide, [MASK], or other strong base present to form a molten silicate or silica-phosphate called " cinder " or " slag," which floats on the molten or pasty metal.
[MASK] to it.
in the basic bessemer process phosphorus is readily removed by oxidation, because the product of its oxidation, phosphoric acid, p 2 o 5, in the presence of an excess of base forms stable phosphates of [MASK] and iron which pass into the slag, making it valuable as an artificial manure.
the basic or dephosphorizing variety of the bessemer process, called in germany the " thomas " process, differs from the acid process in four chief points: (i) that its slag is made very basic and hence dephosphorizing by adding much [MASK] to it; (2) that the lining is basic, because an acid lining would quickly be destroyed by such a basic slag; (3) that the process is arrested not at the " drop of the flame " (§85) but at a predetermined length of time after it; and (4) that phosphorus instead of silicon is the chief source of heat.
the slag, in order that it may have such an excess of base that this will retain the phosphoric acid as fast as it is formed by the oxidation of the phosphorus of the pig iron, and prevent it from being re-deoxidized and re-absorbed by the iron, should, according to von ehrenwerth's rule which is generally followed, contain enough [MASK] to form approximately a tetra-calcic silicate, 4cao,s10 2 with the silica which results from the oxidation of the silicon of the pig iron and tri-calcic phosphate, 3cao,p205, with the phosphoric acid which forms. the danger of this " rephosphorization " is greatest at the end of the blow, when the recarburizing additions are made.
this [MASK] is charged in the form of common quicklime, cao, resulting from the calcination of a pure limestone, caco 3, which should be as free as possible from silica.
the usual composition of this slag is iron oxide, i o to 16%; [MASK], 40 to 50%; magnesia, 5%; silica, 6 to 9%; phosphoric acid, 16 to 20%.
the lining of the converter is made of 90% of the mixture of [MASK] and magnesia which results from calcining dolomite, (ca,mg)co i, at a very high temperature, and 10% of coal tar freed from its water by heating.
the removal of the greater part of the phosphorus takes place after the carbon has been oxidized and the flame has consequently " dropped," probably because the [MASK], which is charged in solid lumps, is taken up by the slag so slowly that not until late in the operation does the slag become so basic as to be retentive of phosphoric acid.
- silicon cannot here be used as the chief source of heat as it is in the acid bessemer process, because most of the heat which its oxidation generates is consumed in heating the great quantities of [MASK] needed for neutralizing the resultant silica.
at the carnegie works mr monell gets the two dephosphorizing conditions, low temperature and basicity of slag, early in the process, by pouring his molten but relatively cool cast iron upon a layer of pre-heated [MASK] and iron oxide on the bottom of the open-hearth furnace.
the [MASK] and iron oxide melt, and, in passing up through the overlying metal, the iron oxide very rapidly oxidizes its phosphorus and thus drags it into the slag as phosphoric acid.
in the first stage the phosphorus is removed from the molten steel by oxidizing it to phosphoric acid, p205, by means of iron oxide contained in a molten slag very rich in [MASK], and hence very basic and retentive of that phosphoric acid.
this slag is formed by melting [MASK] and iron oxide, with a little silica sand if need be.
floating on top of the molten metal, it rapidly oxidizes its phosphorus, and the resultant phosphoric acid combines with the [MASK] in the overlying slag as phosphate of lime.
next the metal is covered with a very basic slag, made by melting [MASK] with a little silica and fluor spar.
coke now charged into this slag first deoxidizes any iron oxide contained in either slag or metal, and next deoxidizes part of the [MASK] of the slag and thus forms calcium, which, uniting with the sulphur present in the molten metal, forms calcium sulphide, cao+fes-}-c=cas+fe+co.
we still use the old familiar purifying agents, iron oxide, [MASK] and nascent calcium.
at the same time, hot springs, containing abundant carbonate of [MASK] in solution, produced deposits of travertine at various points.
[MASK]stone appears in various places, and in the north-east a light grey marble is quarried for lime.
the substances in commonest use are: - [MASK] or limestone, to slag off silica and silicates, fluor-spar for lead, calcium and barium sulphates and calcium phosphate, and silica for removing basic substances such as limestone.

these plateaus, with an average elevation of boo to 1000 ft., are mostly covered with forests of oak, beech and [MASK], and are deeply cut by river valleys, some being narrow and craggy, and others broad, with gentle slopes and marshy bottoms. narrow ravines intersect them in all directions, and they often assume, especially in the east, the character of wild, impassable, woody and marshy tracts.

sometimes, to get rid of these impurities, the brine is treated in a large tub-`(bessoir) with [MASK]; on settling it becomes clear and colourless, but the dissolved lime forms a skin on its surface in the pan, retards the evaporation and impedes the crystallization.

some species belonging to the families squamariaceae and corallinaceae grow attached through their whole length and breadth, and are often encrusted with [MASK].
excepting where the thallus is impregnated with silica, as in diatomaceae, or carbonate of [MASK], as in corallinaceae,characeae and some siphonales, it is perhaps not surprising that algae should not have been extensively preserved in the fossil form.
were hydraulic; it was also known that this property could be conferred on ordinary [MASK] by admixture of silicious materials such as pozzuolana or t.ufa.
heated in a kiln until its carbonic acid has been driven off, it yields pure [MASK].
this slakes violently with water, giving slaked [MASK], which can be made into a smooth paste with water and mixed with sand to form common mortar.
the setting of the mortar is due to the drying of the [MASK] (a purely physical phenomenon, no chemical action occurring between the lime and the sand).
subsequent hardening of the mortar is caused by the gradual absorption of carbonic acid from the air by the [MASK], a skin of carbonate of lime being formed; but the action is superficial.
mortar made from pure or "fat" [MASK] cannot withstand the action of water, and is only used for work done above water-level.
if, however, such "fat" [MASK] is mixed in the presence of water, not with sand but with silica in an active form, i.e.
amorphous and (generally) hydrated, or with a silicate containing silica in an active condition, it will unite with the silica and form a silicate of [MASK] capable of resisting the action of water.
the mixture of the [MASK] and active silica or silicate is a pozzuolanic cement.
the simplest of all pozzuolanic cements would be a mixture of pure [MASK] and hydrated silica, but though the latter is prepared artificially for various purposes, it is too expensive to be used as a cement material.
the slag, which must contain a high percentage of [MASK], is granulated by being run while fused into abundance of water.
this potential energy becomes kinetic when the slag is brought into contact with [MASK] in the presence of water, and causes the formation of a true hydraulic silicate of lime.
the following analysis shows the composition of a typical slag: 99.20 granulated slag of this character is ground with slaked [MASK] until both materials are in a state of fine division and intimately mixed.
the usual proportions are three of slag to one of slaked [MASK] by weight.
they are not usually manufactured by the careful grinding together of the pozzuolana and the [MASK], but are mixed roughly, a great excess of pozzuolana being employed.
this excess does no harm, for that part which fails to unite with the [MASK] serves as a diluent, much as does sand in mortar.
good hydraulic mortars may be made from [MASK] mixed with furnace ashes or burnt clay as the pozzuolanic constituent.
cements of the portland type differ in kind from those of the pozzuolanic class; they are not mechanical mixtures of [MASK] and active silica ready to unite under suitable conditions, but consist of definite chemical compounds of lime and silica and lime and alumina, which, when mixed with water, combine therewith, forming crystalline substances of great mechanical strength, and capable of adhering firmly to clean inert material, such as stone and sand.
the commonest of such substances in england are chalk and clay, but where local conditions demand it, [MASK]stone, marl, shale, slag or any similar material may be used, provided that the correct proportions of lime, silica and alumina are maintained.
next in antiquity to hydraulic [MASK] is roman cement, prepared by heating an indurated marl occurring naturally in nodules.
true, it is possible to manufacture portland cement from portland stone (after adding a suitable quantity of clay), but this is merely because portland stone is substantially carbonate of [MASK]; any other limestone would serve equally well.
although portland cement is later in date than either roman cement or hydraulic [MASK], yet on account of its greater industrial importance, and of the fact that, being an artificial product, it is of approximately uniform composition and properties, it may conveniently be treated of first.
the kilns commonly employed are "chamber kilns," circular structures not unlike an ordinary running [MASK] kiln, but having the top closed and connected at the side with a wide flue in which the slurry is exposed to the hot products of combustion from the kiln.
a possible alternative is to burn the [MASK]stone first and mix the resulting lime with clay, the mixture being burned as before.
as it descends it reaches a part of the kiln where the temperature is higher; here the carbonic acid of the carbonate of [MASK], and the combined water of the clay are driven off, and the resulting lime begins to act chemically on the dehydrated clay.
the burner where the temperature is highest, and is there heated so highly that the union of the [MASK], silica and alumina is complete, and fully burnt clinker falls out of the kiln.
this material must be picked out, as such underburnt stuff contains free [MASK] or unsaturated lime compounds.
thus the silica may range from 19 to 27%, the alumina and ferric oxide jointly from 7 to 14%, the [MASK] from 60 to 67%.
all such variations are permissible provided that the quantity of silica and alumina is sufficient to saturate the whole of the [MASK] and to leave none of it in a "free" condition, likely to cause the cement to expand after setting.
other things being equal, the higher the percentage of [MASK] within the limits indicated above the stronger is the cement, but such highly limed cement is less easy to burn than cement containing about 62% of lime; and unless the burning is thorough and the raw materials are intimately mixed, the cement is apt to be unsound.
the function of the ferric oxide present in ordinary cement is little more than that of a flux to aid the union of silica, alumina and [MASK] in the clinker; its role in the setting of the cement is altogether secondary.
it will be observed that in the hydration of tricalcium silicate, the main constituent of portland cement, a large portion of the [MASK] appears as calcium hydroxide, i.e.
slaked [MASK].
hydraulic [MASK] is a cement of the portland as distinct from the pozzuolanic class.
the most typical hydraulic [MASK] is that known as chaux du theil, made from a limestone found at ardeche in france.
it contains but little alumina and oxide of iron, which are the constituents generally necessary to bring about the union of silica and [MASK] to form a cement, but in spite of this the silica is so finely divided and so well distributed that it unites readily with the lime when the limestone is burned at a sufficiently high temperature.
analyses of the two classes of hydraulic [MASK] are as follows: hydraulic lime contains a good deal of uncombined lime, and has to be slaked before it is used as a cement.
in france this slaking is conducted systematically by the makers, the freshly burned [MASK] being sprinkled with water and stored in large bins where slaking proceeds slowly and regularly until the whole of the surplus uncom bined lime is slaked and rendered harmless, while the cementitious compounds, notably tricalcium silicate, remain untouched.
in english practice hydraulic [MASK] is slaked by the user.
the product may then be regarded as a cement of the portland class mixed with slaked [MASK].
the structure is free to take its permanent position before the [MASK] sets, and cracks are thus avoided.
a case in point is the employment of hydraulic [MASK] in place of portland cement as grouting outside the cast-iron tubes used for lining tunnels made by the shield system.
the term natural cements is applied to cements made by burning mixtures of clay and carbonate of [MASK] naturally occurring in approximately suitable proportions.
ordinary mortar failed in such positions; mortar made from [MASK] prepared from limestones or chalks containing a little clay was found to stand; mortar made from lime mixed with trass or similar active silicious material was also found to stand.
in this case the action of the water is checked by the film of carbonate of [MASK] which eventually forms on the surface of calcareous cement.
the inhabitants of denbigh are chiefly occupied in the timber trade, butter-making, poultry-farming, bootmaking, tanning and quarrying ([MASK], slate and paving-stones).
in the lowlands, on the other hand, rich stores of coal, iron, [MASK] and other minerals have been found.
it is made commercially by boiling benzotrichloride (obtained from toluene) with milk of [MASK], the calcium benzoate so obtained being then decomposed by hydrochloric acid 2c 6 h 5 cc1 3 +4ca(oh) 2 = (c6h6000)2ca-1-3cac12+4h20.
157171); by passing chlorine into milk of [MASK] (c. winkler, jour.
wahl [german patent 70773 (1893)] prepare a 97% manganese from pyrolusite by heating it with 30% sulphuric acid, the product being then converted into manganous oxide by heating in a current of reducing gas at a dull red heat, cooled in a reducing atmosphere, and finally reduced by heating with granulated aluminium in a magnesia crucible with [MASK] and fluorspar as a flux.
the metals, which by combination with oxygen became oxides, were antimony, silver, arsenic, bismuth, cobalt, copper, tin, iron, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, gold, platinum, lead, tungsten and zinc; and the "simple earthy salifiable substances" were [MASK], baryta, magnesia, alumina and silica.

the play of colour is exquisite, the basalt combining every tint of warm red, brown and rich maroon; sea-weeds and lichens paint the cave green and gold; while the [MASK] that has filtered through has crusted the pillars here and there a pure snow-white.
fizeau he carried on a series of investigations on the intensity of the light of the sun, as compared with that of carbon in the electric arc, and of [MASK] in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe; on the interference of heat rays, and of light rays differing greatly in lengths of path; and on the chromatic polarization of light.
the dried nutmegs are then rubbed over with dry sifted [MASK].
the process of liming, which originated at the time when the dutch held a monopoly of the trade, was with the view of preventing the germination of the seeds, which were formerly immersed for three months in milk of [MASK] for this purpose, and a preference is still manifested in some countries for nutmegs so prepared.
as they approached they threw unslaked [MASK] in the air and the wind blew it in the faces of the french.
this liquor is first treated with carbonate of [MASK] (ground chalk or limestone) in a " neutralizing-well," made of acid-proof material and provided with wooden stirring-gear.
the mud thus formed is settled out, and the clear liquor, which is now quite neutral and contains both manganese and calcium chlorides, is mixed with cream of [MASK] and treated by a strong current of air, produced by a blowing-engine.
the first action of the [MASK] is to convert the manganese chloride into manganous hydrate (mn(oh) 2) and calcium chloride; then more lime is added which greatly promotes and hastens the oxidizing process.
the object of the latter is to convert the manganous hydroxide by the atmospheric oxygen into manganese dioxide, but this would take place much too slowly if there was not an excess of [MASK] present ready to combine with the manganese dioxide to form a calcium manganite.
only so much [MASK] is used that an acid manganite is formed corresponding to one molecule of calcium oxide to two of manganous oxide.
this additional [MASK], which is called the " basis," certainly takes up hydrochloric acid in the next stage of the process, but that causes no more waste of acid than the incomplete action on native manganese ore, mentioned before.
as the gas issuing from these contains only about 5 volumes% of hydrochloric acid, it cannot be made to act upon [MASK] in the ordinary bleaching-powder chambers, but specially constructed chambers must be provided (see fig.
bleaching-powder is a compound obtained by the action of free chlorine on hydrated [MASK], containing a slight excess of water at ordinary temperatures or slightly above these.
it always contains a certain quantity of chemically combined water and also an excess of [MASK].
usually this [MASK] is regarded only as mechanically mixed with the bleaching-compound, caocl 2, but some chemists adopt formulae in which this lime is equally represented.
for the manufacture of bleaching-powder, [MASK]stone of high degree of purity (especially free from magnesia and iron) is carefully burned so as to drive out nearly all the carbon dioxide without overheating the lime.
about sixteen such chambers were combined in such manner that the fresh gas passed into that chamber which had been the longest time at work and in which the bleaching-powder was nearly finished, and so forth until the gas, now all but entirely exhausted, reached the last-filled chamber in which it met with fresh [MASK] and there gave up the last of the chlorine.
the fresh [MASK] is continually charged into the top cylinder, is gradually moved towards the other end, falls down into the next lower cylinder and thus gradually makes its way to the lowest cylinder.
if the chlorine is made to act on cream of [MASK], care being taken that the temperature does not rise above 35° and that the chlorine is not in excess, a solution is obtained containing a mixture of calcium chloride and hypochlorite which is a very convenient agent for bleachers, but which does not bear the expense of carriage over long distances.
- formerly all chlorate of potash, as some is still, was obtained by passing chlorine into milk of [MASK], allowing the temperature to rise almost to the boiling-point, and continuing until the bleaching-solution, originally formed, is converted into a mixture of calcium chlorate and chloride, the final reaction being 6ca(oh)2+6c12=5cac12+ca(c103)2+6h20.
this carbon monoxide is formed by the action of coal on the [MASK], formed at this stage from the original limestone.
this is always made from the carbonate by the action of slaked [MASK]: na 2 co 3 +ca(oh) 2 = cac03+2naoh.
some heat is also gained by the slaking of the caustic [MASK] within the liquor.
they are made by dissolving ordinary soda-ash in hot water, adding a small quantity of chloride of [MASK] for the destruction of colouring matter and the oxidation of any ferrous salts present, carefully settling the solution, without allowing its temperature to fall below the point of maximum solubility (34° c.), and running the clarified liquid into cast-iron crystallizers or " cones," where, on cooling down, most of the sodium carbonate is separated in large crystals of the decahydrated form.
the ammonium carbonates are driven out from their solutions by mere prolonged boiling, being thereby decomposed into ammonia, carbon dioxide and water, but the ammonium chloride is not volatile under these conditions, and must be decomposed by milk of [MASK]: 2nh 4 c1+ca(oh) 2 = 2nh 3 +cac1 2 +2h 2 0.
the milk of [MASK] is introduced at a certain distance from the bottom.
the steam causes the action of the [MASK] on the ammonium chloride to take place in this lower portion of the still, from which the steam, mixed with all the liberated ammonia, rises into the upper portion of the column where its heat serves to drive out the volatile ammonium carbonate.
the melt is dissolved in water and the dyestuff is liberated from the sodium salt by hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, or is converted into the calcium salt by digestion with hot milk of [MASK], then filtered and the calcium salt decomposed by acid.
sometimes their homes are mere huts of turf, or of clay tiles, with mortar made from [MASK] and clay or cow-dung.
they have olive presses and flour mills, and their own millstone quarries, even travelling into make [MASK], tiles, woodwork for the houses, domestic utensils and agricultural implements.
kankar or ghutin (concretionary carbonate of [MASK]) is collected for this purpose from the river-beds and alluvial deposits.

sci., 18 9 1 (3), 43, p. 475); rubidium sulphate, rb2s04, is formed by the action of sulphuric acid on the carbonate or hydroxide of the metal, or by the action of milk of [MASK] on rubidium alum, the excess of lime being precipitated by rubidium carbonate and the solution neutralized by sulphuric acid.

his method consisted in using magnesia instead of [MASK] for the recovery of the ammonia (which occurs in the form of ammonium chloride in the ammonia-soda process), and then by evaporating the magnesium chloride solution and heating the residue in steam, to condense the acid vapours and so obtain hydrochloric acid.
thatched roofs are not now allowed in london or other towns and their vicinity, but if saturated with a solution of [MASK] the thatch is said to be incombustible.
