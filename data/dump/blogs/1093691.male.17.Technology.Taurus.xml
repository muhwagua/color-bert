       No one has joined yet, because I've only just sent the invites but its new year in roughly 4 hours I think? Next year we have GCSE's and then starting collage/6th Form. How calming. LOL. Stress stress stress! Perhaps we should all take up yoga? Or learn another language fluently so that if we fail really badly we can move to that country and be a whole new person. Wouldn't that be quite good, if when your life got so bad you could just step out of it and into a whole new one! Brilliant.  Well, people, blog!!!!

       About the  urlLink snooboo.com Forum , I made a tiny slip up and accedently signed everybody out. So just log in again and it's as good as new - if you have forgotton your password, just use the Remind Password feature at the bottom of the page.   urlLink A picture of a toliet  taken by my brother. Last year he went on a trip to Germany for the Christmas Markets, we have just got the photos back, and we have cellings, we have floors, we have parts of the human body (mainly feet and hands) and to top it all off we have a photo of the toilet on the coach. Amazing photography from my brother. If you want a high-resolution picture of the toliet (big enough to go on your desktop) please do contact me.  Something not quite right about that paragraph...   Anyway, no more and no less to say really - good night.

       No the goverment won't increase pay for teh amount they are asking, they need to compramise because surely any raise is a good one? Even if it is only a couple of quid!  Everyone, I am adding a new nickname to my internet and text etc.. nickanmes: from now on, as wlel as Nicki, Nick, Sodapop and Emu I will be known as, NIKKO. Heehee. And yes there is a reason behind it but very few people know. Heehee.

       Aaaaaahhhhh, parents evening. My dad forgot most of it by the time he got home.  I ya want my opinion, the firefighters can strike for as long as they want, because the government are not going to increase their salaries by that much. Any twats that arnt careful and start fires when there are strikes can burn coz its their fault for doing it in the first place. The war I dont care about either. America are prepared to launch at minumum 400 missiles a day. Anyway, if the war starts when i'm out in America, wheyyyyy! We either: die. or stay out there until it ends :)  Toodles people, I hope you enjoyed my extremley motivational speech.

       Thats cool Tom, I think it looks good, because it creates the picture you want to see but has differnet effects and its own frame even! Wicked!  Well since I got home I have been playing about with my new 6 in 1 hair straightener. I love the curler and have been trying out leavers ball hairstyles! Yipeee. I gave up an hour ago though, kinda burnt my hand about 3 times or so.    I think the fire fighers should wait, they will get more attenion if they wait until the stuff about Iraq has all gone, or at least got canceled.  It won't be canceled. War cannot be canceled, postproned but never canceled.

       I have (sort of) managed to scan in some photos and put them together to give you the view outside of my hotel when I went to Italy. The quaility isn't very good and the lighting conditions change in each photo, and I am missing one, and they don't line up,  urlLink but you get the idea . The mountain in the background is Mt Versovous (the one that didn't explode). The city next to it is Naples, and the town I am in is called Surento.  I think the fire fighers should wait, they will get more attenion if they wait until the stuff about Iraq has all gone, or at least got canceled.

       My parents evening. Science (Moore) was ok, we had already figured out a revision thing after school. Art, she loves me. Heehee. History was good, he said that my coursework was very good and Q2 of womens suffrage was excellent. Then I moaned at him for not putting comments on it except 'reorganise'. LOL. Um, maths, my mum likes him, lol, she thinks he is really nice. He said that all I need to do is to get 4 more questions irght in the exam and I'll get a C!!!!! Yipee! English, fine fine, briliant, marvleous, excellent. Textiles, my machine work has improved considerably, everyhing is good, my paperwork is currently at a grade B so don't be surpise dif I end up getting a A or even A* apparently. Cool. Mr G is so lazy. Throughout the whole hour and bit we were there he spoke to 2 parents. The rest of the time he was just milling about or writing something. Tutt tutt. he shouldhave found something constructive to do.  Now Tom, I agree with your last paragraph in your previous blog. Very well said. Email them, complain. I might. Actually, about the firefighters. I agree with their strikes, I don't agree with how much they are asking but striking is giving them the attention and support they need. However, I do not agree with them going on strike now when we are about to go to war with Iraq, which I reckon will happen in about 10 days time if that. (They better leave korea alone btw, just look at what happened in Vietnam!!!!) They are tying up valuable troops. Even the Gerkuas or however you spell it are helping out and they are extremly valuable! These are the guys which is their sword is drawn they must produce blood with it or kill someone before it can be put back into its sheath believe it or not. Now I will continue to support the firefighters, my Dad used to be one and we tend to go to alot of the these firefighter things, shows etc.. but I really do think they should stop all this striking until tropps are available.  Have a nice day ya'll.

       Parents Evening, I didn't go as we where tight on times to get me there, but my mother gave me all the information I need. All the normal stuff like try not to stink of fags when you walk into the class room, and show some respect for the celling, use all four legs of the chair, all the normal. My favoruite quote from the evening; "he has a wicked sense of humor", my business studies teacher. She quite liked the idea that it's cheaper to use robots because they can work in the dark. (Bit of a nerdy business joke, so don't feel gulity if you don't get it.)  I know I haven't blogged for a little while, been very busy getting my head round completcated programming problems, which still have yet to be solved. Anybody with a logical mind please enquire within.  My favourite part of music lessons has started! Sorry, did I say favourite? I meant my most hated dreaded I-really-don't-want-to-do-this part of music. Composition. Sounds easy? You just write lots of notes down, play 'em and then you're done, but there are several probelems. First of all, I can't sight read very well so when I have to play them back to myself, I can't remember what I did. Secondly, I can't read or write bass cleff, I can barely manage trebble cleff! Thirdly, I can't compose! I don't know what to do and what ever I write sounds like a monkey wrote it. This is the kind of point where I think to my self I don't want to spend 1/4th of my 6th form eduction on the flipping subject. I enjoy listening to music, and to some extent I enjoy playing it, but I hate composing and I hate learning about it. The fact the clarient wasn't around in the Baroque period isn't important information to me. I really don't need to know that serialsim sounds like me playing the piano with my arse, and I really do not need to know that a Sitar is a guitar from India without frets! I don't care! I really do not care! I don't want to know this information, please, no more! That is the end! No more ever please!   urlLink How do you mend a broken heart?   The quaility of tabloids is really getting to me - it's crap. A Solicitor jailed for life for murdering her two baby sons is freed by court of appeal, Tony Blair today pledged that after dealing with Iraq, the UN would confront North Korea about its nuclear weapons programme, and The deputy prime minister John Prescott yesterday lost patience with the striking firefighters, announcing radical new laws which would enable ministers to seize control of the industry and impose a pay and reform package. So after all this in an amazing day of news, what does The Sun have for a headline and leading story? Zoe Ball and Norman Cook - the most read "news" paper (using "news" in the broadest possible manner) in the UK and all they care about is the realtionship between two people that I really don't care about. Yes, Norman Cook has made some pretty cool music, but I really think his private and work life should be seperated and respected.  Anyway, just got to say my bit about possible war and the monkey man himself.  urlLink This sums it all up  really, nothing much else to say other than what you can see in that cartoon.

       Lol. It is 8.06, and I literally have just  finished my tea, having just got home from a   very   amusing parent's evening! Highly amusing! Basically I'm awful and am gonna fail all my GCSEs is what the teachers said, and that I'm a rebel, trboule-maker, etc etc, the usual. But other than that, a VERY amusing chat with old Mr Westlife (his bame has been changed due to the fact he has called me Josephine twice this week), and then I couldn't stop laughing when I finally sat down to talk to Mrs HIcks, a) cos I knew what my mother was gonna say, b) it was quite funny seeing my mum smiling at Mrs Hicks in her 'Yeah, I'm smiling and acting pleasant but I think you are an absolute twat' way that she does, and c) my mum had said to me before hand that I could tell all my friends that she's sorry but she tried, and she couldn;'t get her hands all the way rouind Mrs Hick's neck!!! I just could hardly control myself, and Mrs HIcks probably wondered why I couldn't stop smiling at her! Anyway, hwo did eveyerone else go? Oh, and I  have found the route of my head pains- I need to stop grinding my teeth, cos it sends pains up my jaw, adn that is where it ius coming from! SO solution found! toodles peeps.

       Headache, you had a headache! I bet mine was 100000000000000 times worse than yours! Not only have I had it for a week now but i don't have an eyeappointment for another 2 weeks. An dto top that off when I was bending ove rto pick something up off teh floor in my room I whacked my head on the side of bed (has a this wooden thing around the edge) and now have a dent in it as well as a added to headache. Hmph. But I thought it was very nice to come in, put on the internet for a quick spin on my usual message boards and blogs to find that all my cool Ryan fans are really lovely and nice and don't argue with me for the sake of it. In fact they are all relaly suportive of each other, really helpful and are happy to help each other out. Then my cousin was on msn and it was cool talking to him as he is in North Carolina. His wife, dawn, has an interview tomorrow and if she gets the job they will be moving to....ready....CHICAGO! Wahoo! They are both really lucky!!! Brilliant. have to go and visit them then. :)

       No, I will not go to tan. But that site I put up was a American one and they should have a tan anyways. No I will not be waxing, I mean like dude, the pain!! I will just put on my dress, get my shoes and bag, try and do my hair poshly and nice make up and have a good time. Brilliant.

       Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!!! May I just point out though, I willl be looking after my skin but I won't be going to the full extent of having a facial (way too expensive), I won't be having a pedicure (hwo much monye is this gonna cost?!), and I won't be waxing. Guys, if you think we all complain too much about pain, I dare you to try waxing your legs, and see how much pain you get into!! Not a funny thing, waxing. Ooh, and self tan- so not a good idea if youare accident prone (comme moi!)- probably won't be doing that either, unless it washes off if it goes horribly wrong! Anyway, I cnat be bothered really, cos I'm really pale anyway, and I generally can't be assed to go to all the ttrouble. I mean, my mum ends up with orange knees and orange hands and stuff, and at the beginning of May it is blatantly obviuos it is fake! Plus, I look ill (apparently) any way, so people will just have to accept me for what I am!! Nicki, Jackie, (and perhaps even Max??!!), are yoi going to be using fake tan? I know loadsa girls in our class have been on sun beds already, but there isn't a better way to fry your skin than to go on a sun bed, so that is a definite no-no. Anyway, I am just soooooooooooo excited about it all! I mean, for most of us, this is our first real chance to dress up in really posh clothes and act all posh and have a posh meal with our friends and ride in limos and scream adn dance all night wihtout our parents being there! Wooooooooooooohhhoooooooooo!!1 I am so excited!! You boys will have to time it so that we arrive at the same time as you  (near enough!), so we can all go in together as one   phat   gang!! OMG i am so excited!! OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!! Yahhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey! Anyway, over-and-out from Jo-Jo!!!

       Well, I think pot noddles ae minging. basically. I agree with Jo, way to violent. It is making a mockery of Christianity. But yea Tom, that guy dancing is pretty amusing. Why is he killing them all anyway? Just to dance? How strange.  Anyway, I watched Ryan last night! Yaaaaay!  Debut on UK TV!!!!! Waaaaaaaahhhhhhoooooooo!!!!!! He died.                                                     That was relaly scary actually because you could hear him screaming and I was like nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Mind you I actually screamed at one point because the alien dude scared the bejeebus outta me. I'm so silly, I spend the whole program hiding behind my hands. LOL. Now I am off to town soon to go shopping, with Angela and Jo C. Hoepfully. If they turn up. I hope. But first I must go post on el forum. Chal.

       IM BAAAAAAAAAAAACK. Well, this week has been interesting. Been making green sites with Tom, eating pot noodles as soon as I get up, putting myself to sleep with chocolate, flicking water at Jackie and proving to Mr Gallagher that chewing helps me to think. I have also seen a few incredible things like Nicki drinking from a David Brent mug, Andy and Jackie breaking a safety screen and people climbing D-block with hockey sticks (and me falling off and nearly breaking my back). I have just given my parents £20 to go and buy me the DVD Ratrace when they go shopping. So no prizes for guesssing what i'll be watching when I go to bed. I have a few pieces of homework, English, Science, Tech and um, somthing else. I'm not gonna write a long blog, as they get boring. Byedibye.

       Well I have done all my homework (only one piece to do) and watched a film, Cool Runnings. Love that film. LOL. Now I am listening to all these clips I have downloaded from the inertnet. How amusing. Tonight Taken is on so I WILL be watching that. Not that anyone else will, apart from Andy probably. I'm off to town tomorrow with Jo C and Angela to spend my vouchers. Will it be fun? We'll have to wait and see. So, other than that. Chal for now.

       I went to the prom dress shop this moring and tried loadsa dresses on, it was soooooooooo fun! I'm now really excited about it all, but I have to wait till the end of February when she gets all her summer stock in b4 I buy anything. But anyway, I tried on some really pretty dresses and stuff, and it was quite a battle! There was this purple thing that was high at the front, and had criss cross straps, and I got totaly tied up in it, and the shop owner had to rescue me from it, it was quite embarrasing!! But anyway, that's me for you! It was this really nice little shop with posh clothes, no-one in there apart from the shop owner, and she picks out stuff that will suit  you, it's really cool! I thik that I'm going to go for a 2 piece, with a full (er) skirt and a boned-top (strapless) cos I tried this purple one on and it looked really good (even if i say so myself!), but it was too big, so it was being held in at the back! I'm going to go back when she has her new stock, and get one in a smaller size, and they do alterations and stuff there. BUT I am sooooooooo excited about it all, it was just such fun (apart from when I got stuck!!). Anyway, I'll stop rabbiting and go and do something useful!! Talk to ya later guys!

What have I been doing recenatly? Not a lot really. Just general things that you normaly do in January. I don't really have the energy to blog right at this point in time, and I really don't have a lot to anyway. I want something interesting and exciting to happen, soon - getting a bit bored at the moment. Have a good weekend people. When something happens I will tell you all about it.

       Maybe you s hold get your eyes tested nicki? Cos I had headaches a lot when I was younger, practiaclly every day, and it turned out i needed to have glassses cos my eyes strain too much. And anyway, its probably that you're stressed!  To be honest, I cacn't remeber nething about fame Academy (i onl watchewd a few), but i know i wanted Sinead to win, and I don't even remember who Ainsley was! Was he the black dude, or am I getting confuzzled with Ainsley Harriot? Um, dunno! oh, and I have just noticed it is Ainslie. But never mind, can't be assed to chgen it all!  I have watched very  little tv recently, only on the day i was off ill when I watched MTV and saw TATU's viedo (quite disturbing, not that i have nehting against lesbians, just its a bit disturbing).

       Pah. Yesterday was a bad day. I really could not be bothered to blog but I am blogging now so hopefully something I say may get othes to join in! I have a thumping headache btw. I have had all week. In fact its got me slightly worried. I mean, is it normal to have a headache everyday? Didn't Dr Greene on ER have lots of headaches before they figured out, that he, um, had a brain tumour? Crap.  But I mean like I wouldn't rule that out! Tumours are cancer yea? Well I think everyone in my family have died of some form of cancer. Pants. What a nice thought huh!  Well, on the TV just now they played all the fame acadmey videos. David, Sinead and Ainslie. Out of all three I must say that Ainslie has the best song and the video is quite nifty. It would be funny with Ainslie in the USa, they would not like him! I mean, he sometimes has on nail varnish but I think when performing he has just a hint of eye make up on. Which I don't mind. I think personally that if a guy has like eyeliner on it can make them look quite sexy.... or maybe that is my gothic side coming through. LOL.

       Well yoga has all different levels. From begininger to advanced. I guess when you start it you would feel silly becaause you aren't flexible but I guess the more you practise the easier you will find it to relax and once you relax the eaiser it wiwll be to become more flexible. And at the same time it improves your daily mood and way of dealing with things. :) Good way to chill out too. I'd like to try it actually although i know I said to Tom its silly but I have changed my mind. LOL.

       Go to that flexible club thingy, according to Laura it was good and she's gonna keep going, and there was only a few people there, so it was okay she said!  Other than that, I don't wanna sound rude jackie, but where would u put a trampoline? And where would u use it during the iwnter months? And when it rains (whihc is 2 outa eveyr 3 days in the UK!)

       Good morning.  Sorry, I just wanted to say that. My sister has this briliant radio which you can program as an alarm clock but te groovy thing is if you put a CD in it will wake you up with that CD and the song you choose!! Brilliant.

       Our limo has been left in the hands of Andy to sort out, so I think I might give him a nunge to get it going if people are getting booked up. I will blog more tomorrow, I started to late. But this evening my family and I went to the warehouse theatre for a very funny performance. More later.

       He he he!!! WE have a limo bookedf, and it was affordable!! huuuuuuuuuuuuuge thanks to Natalie on that one! Yeah, i did my own enquiries tonight, i phoned numerous taxi services which had pretty crappy cars at high prices, and i phoned 7 limo companies, 4 of which were already fully booked for May 9th, the other 2 were veyr expensive, and one didn't answer the phone, Pah! But at least we r sorted with it!, and Jackie and NIcki, MY LIMO BUDDIES!!! How exciting! But yeah, I expect by May we will be too vbusy with revisio and stuff than to spend hours trapsing round lookming for dresses. I will get my dress asap, and do jewellery etc at a later date, i thinks! Ooooh, I'm so excited I cant think of nething else to sya, except tiiiiiiiiiiidles people!!

       Well the 'rents can be surpirsing. Maybe if you make a deal or something with them and say that you will try and save up even if yu only contribute a small amount. You never know! Good luck with it anyway :) I hear what you are saying about the prom thing. I mean pople need to book limos now because they will be gone by the time it comes around and I guess it same with the dresses, its best to get them early. I think everyone has just been in a leavers ball mood this week! I guess the phase will pass but it is someting nice to look forward to.

       ahhhhhh my parents ! As you may know i want a trampoline, now i have asked my parents for one as a joint christmas and birthday present. I have alos found one for £355 which is quite cheap for a trampoline, but all i get is No your not having one, No you dont need one and NO YOUR NOT HAVING ONE ! But the thing is i really want one and i know for a fact i would use it alot to practise on :( It is getting me really annoyed and frustrated and my birthday isnt until July ! lol. Anyway today was quite boring and i think i have really hurt my elbow cause when eva i hold something with that arm the elbow really hurts and is very painfull. But maybe im just a wimp ! And about the prom, its AGES away, why is everybody worring about it now? Im fed up of people going on aboutn it and who is going with who, we havent even been told where it is yet we have only heard rumours and stuff, we havent been told by the head of year or anything ! Knowing our luck it wont be where we thin kit is and it wont happen !lol bye

       Seeing as everyone has been talking about the ball for a while now, although not actually in the blog I thugh I would post up a few tips, for the girls anyway: (These are from my sister and from american prom sites I have been on)  After purchasing your dress, customise it with a elegant belt or maybe add decoration to teh dress itself depending on your sewing skills. That way, if someone turns up wearing the same dress as you at least yours will be slightly different, if not better.  Don't put on bright make up!!! Keep it simple and beautiful.  Earrings which dangle usually add to the elegance. According to  urlLink this  American prom site we should do the following:  4 Months Before Prom...  Make a checklist.  Find out how much money your parents will contribute.  Start saving money if necessary.  Pick out that special dress (put it on lay-away if necessary).   3 Months Before Prom...  Begin to maintain your hair and nails.  Pick out your accessories to coordinate with your dress.   6 Weeks Before Prom...  Purchase your Prom tickets.  Make an appointment to have your hair, nails, and makeup done.  If you are doing your own hair, start trying out different styles.  If you have not been asked for a date yet, check to see if the one you would like to go with has asked anyone, or ask a close friend before it’s too late. You can also go with a group of friends and have just as much fun and sometimes more.  Discuss your plans for Prom with your parents.   4 Weeks Before Prom...  Start wearing your Prom shoes around the house to break them in.  Pick up your Prom dress.  If you haven’t already done so, introduce your Prom date to your parents.   2 Weeks Before Prom...  Confirm all reservations and appointments you have made for the day and night of Prom.  Take care of last minute details: pantyhose, film, etc.   Prom Day  Pick up your date’s boutonniere.  Go to your hair, nails, and makeup appointment(s).  Put some extra cash in your purse.

       I'm not leaving u out, and anyway, I didn't organise it, MIchelle asked me if Donna and I wanted to go in a limo with her, so we said yes. Anway, I did make a blog, but I could not for the ilfe of me work out how to format it, so i deleted it again! I was ognna try and teach myself HTML or whateva, but I couldn't! Never mind.

       Ah, now you see this is exactly what I mean when I say that I would get left, I already am being left out. People are organizing groups etc.. to go with in limos and stuff yet no one has asked me. I mean I happy to help out organize a little group but I don't want to be like THE one who does.  No, I don't think I will go to the ball after all.  Has anyone else made any other blogs no wthey have an account? If so what are they and I can link them to your name above instead of email or other sites.

Other than that, school has been pretty usual  today,  um, can't really think of much else to say, nothibg major happened, nothing excisitng happened. nothing really to blog about! Oh, other than Michelle is sorting out our limo for the ball tonihgt!

       Well as I said anyway I am usually free as I don't have much of a social life. The dates I now I am out on are next weekend, March 15th and I am away at half term. That is the best I can do unless you want dates for half term? I leave on the Sunday come back on the Friday. Happy now?  And for anyone in the blog or anyone who reads the blog and thinks that the war on Iraq won't happen I will now quote George Best who I think has put this extremly well:  I wish all these people who are dithering about whether or not we should invade Iraq would stop wasting valuable oxygen. We  will  be going to war against Saddam Hussein, it's as simple as that. It's pretty obvious that the Americans have already made up their minds, and I'm glad they have the guts to do it.  And it goes on from there. And also please keep in mind that  you cannot prepare and prevent war at the same time .  [EDIT]I FOUND THE PICTURE! Its a picture of Ryan Merriman an dtis alien kid he tries to save for episode 4 of Taken, he gets killed, they both get killed, in a fire:  urlLink HERE .

       Oh dont worry, ignore that section of my last post.  I am trying to get an appropriate date for EVERYONE, so if I say, for example, 12th Feb, 3 out of 10 people may come, whilst if a small survey is carried out, then the maximum amount of people can come.

       What the hell are double line breaks? You don't need to post  like this. A simple new line is fine and much easier to read. It doesn't take up as much space either. And about skating, just tell me the date your going and I will tell if I can go or not. Its much easier that way. I don't usually go out anyway. I'm not socialble, really. I am out next weekend, hopefully I'll be in Croydon with Angela spending my vouchers. Or maybe I will buy a train ticket and go all the way down to lands End and back.

       Ack ack ack. I'm so bored. Just got back from the IWM which was okay, the bit I liked best was the 'secret war' exhibit about MI5 and MI6, and also the Post 1945 conflicts exhibit, mainly because although i think the wars were terrible tragedies, they don't really interest me all that much, I prefer modern stuff. So yeah, I had an okay day. Now I feel very car sick, and i had forgotten i had so much homeowkr, otherwise i would have done it yesterday and not left it till this evening!! Ooops. Oh well, off to finihs writing baout water boards. What fun.

       Can everybody give me dates that you CANNOT come ice skating. I will work out the most appropriate date for everyone then.   P.S: Includes weekends and inset days up til the half term in February.   Nicki, did you turn off double line breaks in this blog?

       Jackie, yea lets do that on msn. Max, fair enough but it would be handy if you could post brefly in the future to say 'I may not be on here for a few days' like Jo did earlier and that applies to everyone. Then we know where everyone is and I don't start thinking that this was a waste of time. No Tom I haven't seen LOTR and I don't want to. Oh and please don't write Ryan with " around it. He is a person not someone I have made up so don't talk about him as if he isn't real. And yea he is the Ryan I was talking about. I don't exactly know any others do I?

And you wanna get inside my head do ya ? I wouldnt want to, its full of crap and useless information that i have pickeed up in my childhood. lol. Anyway can someone else try and do the 2 questions i set please?

       *Sigh* You know I can't believe you asked that Tom. How many times have I told everyone who he is? About a bzillion. Thsi is just proof that people don't listen to me. Ryan Merriman is an upcoming actor, he has been atcing since he was a kid. He is known at all in the UK. I only know of him because when I went to Florida last year they were premiering a new film of his on zoog disney and I watched like 7 times. It was a brilliant film. So when I got home I looked him up on the ineternet and now I am a solid fan. Happy now or do I have to explain what zoog disney is as well? Armagedon has excellent graphics, it is not a silly movie. Just because something like that hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't etc.. so chil out and just watch it and admire Ben Affleck. Don't worry anyone, you don't have to watch Taken just because I asked people too or the fact that I have been reminding people since a week before the first episode. You are the ones who are missing out on a excellent program, by the makers of Band Of Brothers. No Jackie, you don't have to blog everyday. But it would be handy if people can try and blog at least every 2/3 days. Please.  If you could be one person for the day who would you be?  I'd like to be Ryan Merriman just to see what its like being him as he is filming a vew show at the moment. Or if I had to be a female it would be Jackie because I wouldlove to get inside her head.... :) Jo, yea you can pay £20.  I have another question for you all can you name one boys and one girls name for every letter of the alphabet?  A-amy B-belinda C-caroline D-dina E-erica F-felicity G-gemma H-holly I-isabel J-joan K-katie L-linda M-mary N-nicole O-olivia P-patrica Q- R-racheal S-shelly T-tina U- V-victoria W-wendy X- Y-yasmine Z-zaniah

       Good evening. He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl, can I make it any more obvious? We are in love, haven't you heard, how we rock each others world?  Armagedon really is pants, and a bit silly. I did not enjoy that movie, sorry. Girls, please explain, why are bras done up at the back, and not at the front? This evening, I went to a rather amsuing performance of Puss in Boots which Jo has been talking about, and it was very good - highly amusing. A few lines where wrong here and there, but it was all a good laugh. Nicki - who is Ryan Merriman?

       I'm here Nicki! Sorry I haven't been blogging much at all (and I can probably speak for Dave here too), but we have both been at panto every night this week till about 11pm, and by the time I have got home I have been knackered, and not had time to blog! So I apologise for me, and I am betting that David's reason is the same! I actually watched it last night (eveyr other night i have been changing scenery) , and it was hilarious! The Dame (who is always brilliant) messed up the end so much. They were singing this song about  'Where's the Cat'  to the tune of Robin Hood, and he came in at the worng time, so eveyrone was singing different things, and then he said " right, after 3" but ewhen he got to 3 they were in the wrong place in the music, so he had to say "4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9" really qyicly, and it was so funny! Also, they got the whoel audience stadnign up and sitting down in time to the music, and some bloke got totally out and stood up at totally thew wrong time on his own, and everyone laughed at him sooooooooooo much! Even the Dame started laughing, whcih he usually doesn't do (they're not supposed to laugh!). Other than that, the usual panto 'hitches' have happened (including the princess not turning up on cue, and then not appearing for a few minutes after that too!), but generally it is all a good laugh and everyone has a wail of a time! I have also made some new freinds, which is rather nice.  PANTO PARTY  next weekend, guys!" yay! Can't wait! Hah ha ha ha.  FREDDIE AND CHIRS. Ahem. Nicki, Are you sure you don't mind if I pay £20? I will pay monday, if that's okay. Yell if it isn't, or whateva!

       Max you are participating more than Dave but you kinda stopped cos of the argument you and Jackie were having. Anyway, its not friday anymore its Saturday. What does that mean for moi? Hmm, homework and cleaning my room which is disgustingly dirty and messy. Thatway I get tomorrow to 'relax' as Goff says. If you didn't get that when I asked her what she up too in the summer holidays it was 'nothing much, just relaxing' then I ask what are you going to do on holiday? 'Relax'. Bless. I am going to Croydon next weekend with Angela hopefully. I have vouchers to spend and hopefully I can get a computer game I have wanted for ages. I prefer games like the Sims where youa ct as god. LOL. Like Rolocoaster tycoon etc... I prefer them than fighting games. I reckon there are way too many of those games out, I mean how many can you possibly make! They are all the same! Your character justs goes around shoots and blows up people. Yea... that is why I like manger type games. You can make the Sims do so many things! You can design your own rolocoasters and see if people like them etc.. Much more mind stimulating I reckon. What things have I got to look forward too? Freddie Prinze Jr. and Chris Klein! Yay. And at half term I'm going on up to Norfolk to see my Auntie. I already know one day we are going up to this posh country club like we did before for a dinner. I love country clubs. they are so countrylike and posh. I already said that but they are. Honest.  Where is Jo nowadays? I mean I know she is helping her friend at the panto but now its the weekend! Shes gotta blog at some point, hasn't she? Hey guys, don't forget,  09:00PM - BBC2 - TAKEN . Watch it, please. Pleeeeeeease. Although its episode 4 I am waiting for when my love is in it. :)

       Good evening. How can this be? Why can this be? There is no other way, this can be the only way.   IT'S FRIDAY!  Come one people! Party! No? I know, it's misserable, it's January, it's cold, it's wet, it's annoying, and generaly, it's shit. There really isn't any other way of putting it.  Something to look forward to, I think my mum and I may be going to the lake district in the Easter holidays for some walking, yay!  Anyway, blog lots over the weekend, have a good one guys.

       I said to you as I emailed Dave, if you do not participate in the blog before Sunday you will be removed because there are other people I could invite to join who will blog. I had a crap day today and can't be bothered to moan about it right now.  I made someone happy today. That is something I am trying to do each day. I will be sending a video to a girl in Brazil. She can't get programs which Ryan Merriemn is in there so I am recording Taken for her so she can watch it. Shes now really happy. And these are some of the reasons why I wish to go to Antartica on a cruise:  urlLink 001   urlLink 002   urlLink 003   urlLink 004   urlLink 005   urlLink 006   urlLink 007

       Good evening. That was my brother lost in the rubble. That was my sister lost in the crush. That was our mothers, those were our children. That was our fathers, that was each of us.  Today was a normal day, for me. Not for others. Poor Jo wasn't a happy bunny this morning, so she went home, and I can't blame her really, the poor thing, being cold and tired isn't nice. I am sure she is nice and warm tucked up in bed fast asleep. Lisa hasn't had the best day as some of you know, but I won't go into detail on here. But, not to worry, because tomorrow is Friday, and also as Mrs Crouch reminded me, we are ever getting closer to February!  I really don't know what to say, so if I haven't got anything to say, I might as well just go.

       Ok, I thought it was clear but I obviously have to state it again. To anyonoe who is a friend of mine, I am a good listener. If people ever need to talk weather it be to moan or be angry, cry or just rant and rave I will listen. If they then want an opinion or suggestion on what to do about it I will try. If they want any help, I will try. I seem to have a knack of cheering people up as well which is always useful. And if the thing they rant about or want to get off their chest and tell me is a big secret, if they ask me to keep it a secret I will. i always have done, and I always will. So people, if you need someone to listen I AM HERE!!!! People forget that!!!!  Now that is said, my day? PSE was amusing with that homosexual video but when Miss Reid tol dus about that Major from the army coming in to talk to us I was like "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEAAAAAAAAAAA". Wooooo! Then 2 hours of English back on back, hmm, it was ok I guess. We had to do a mini-presentation on a poem which I found funy in my gorup. I mean Sean and Pat were in it! But I admit it, I do make judgements on labels etc.. no matter how much I tell people not to judge grungers just because of the musi cthey listen to and stuff because I judged Sean on the fact of who he hung aorund and he is a pretty nice guy. I was wrong, I admit it. Then we had lunch which was fantabulous wth our whole blockading the tech block in. LOL. Sooo funny! After lunch what did I have? Sciene! With Mr Gallagher, we made progress today. Now he knows my name...usually its simply 'Michelles friend' or 'Jackies friiend'. Heehee. Then German which is never that amusing anyway. So. Yup. There we go.

       Good evening, I been knocked down so many times, counted out 6, 7, 8, 9. Written off like some bad deal, if you're breating you know how it feels, call it karma, call it luck, I just don't give a  I never knew Virgin radio could be so dirty, extreamly dodgy stuff going on at this time, all kinds of things. Tune in after 10pm to 105.8 FM. It is the 16th of January, which means we are half way through the month, which means it's nearly February!  At this present moment in this thing we call "time" I am extreamly annoyed with myself, I really don't understand what is going on. Teachers keep telling me that I need some help, and then they decide that I need to work harder and that I don't really need any help, so I have no idea what to do, and it's rather annoying.  Jackie, tell all, I do, and look what happens. It is perfectly okay, we arn't exactly going to take the mick or anything, and so what if somebody sends an e-mail? I know people talk about me for different reasons (mainly bad things) but so long as I don't hear it, I don't mind. If I where you, I would get it all out of your system and really go for it. My problem is I never have anybody to talk to, there are so many things I want to say, but I really don't want to bore people with it, but I really want somebody just to listen. I am trying to convince myself of this as well, but here is a theory of mine; You are born, and then you die, and anything in the middle is a bonus. So I am going to live as long as possible, and if I muck it up, oh well, I am hardly going to be regretting it when I am dead because I won't be able to think.  Are we all in touch with the news? We are sending the biggest ship in our Navy to join the rest of the guys in the Gulf. The thing that is really annoying me, a question that Charles Kennedy raised, if the USA go to war, but the UN don't - will the UK? I personaly believe that if the UN say we should go to war, then we should "join in" and go along with it, otherwise we are going to be the misserable Brits who don't do anything. However, if the UN say "no" to war, and the USA go to war, we should definatly not go with them. Without UN backing, they are making an offensive move as Iraq haven't exactly attacked the USA.  But we don't need to talk about rubbish such as war? We need to be happy and smily, even if we are in tears. I need to dream, and I have just remembered, I haven't answered Nicki's question about honeymoons. For my location, like I said, I really want to be somewhere different and unique. Away from anything else, just completely me, my wife, and nothing else. Perhaps a deserted island? Something with beatuiful scenery, next to a beach, blue waters. For the perfect wife? I am not fussed about looks and colours, blue or brown eyes, dark or light hair, I don't mind, I have the same preferences as most people, big clear eyes that you can just stare into for hours on end. They have to have a good sense of humor, enough to make me laugh, however beable to be completly serious at other moments. She has to like active sports so we can go to interesting places walking and things. I really want to do some back-packing somewhere, like in India. Anyway, I could go on for ages...  Life is rather dull, January is always like this, nobody can really be bothered to do anything. Once we get into February and half-term, people will start to pick up again, and then it's home free 'till Easter, then that's it, pretty scary. I am curently sorting myself out for work after I have finished my GCSE (last one is on the 25th June I think) - what is everybody planning to do over the holidays? Remember, you have two months free.  Good night all.

       well what a fun day i had today ! 1. boys are assholes, you tell them something in confidence then a couple of weeks later you find out that half of their mates know and possibly half of the school as well. 2. Max your outta order i neva said you could tell anyone bout wot i said and that is why i didnt say anything to anyone else. 3.Im really pissed off today 4.Im not gonna tell anyone anything about how or feel or whats up with me from now on cause it will end up somewhere like an email inbox 5.Is life worth living? Is Ilife worth being born? Is it worth me being around? 6. No one cares about me and i wish i wasnt here

       Hmm. I can see you have put a lot of thought into it. However my thoery seems to work too. I mean, thepeople I care about in the way I think you mean don't care about me in return, someone don't even know who I am or have even heard of me! Now that can get you depressed...or you choose not to be. There are choices everywhere in your daily routine yea? Wheather to get up now or in five minutes, eat this or that, drink this or that, do this or not etc... So if someone doesn'r care for you in return you can either choose to be depressed or choose to be happy and just be glad they are your mate or something. See what I'm saying? And anwsering my own question from earlier: for my honeymoon I'd go on a cruise to the Antartica and my perfect husband? A bit of you-know-who mixed with a bit of you-know-who and then some of you-know-who. Perfect.

       Good evening. Don't point that hamster at me! lalalalalalalala dadadadadadad Today, in my little world, I discovered that being insane helps despression, or so says my camel, Steve. Life is shite. That is a fact, there is nothing I can do about it. No matter how hard I try, no matter what I do, things will always turn out for the worse. No matter how deap my bomb shelter is, or how many weeks worth of food we have. It doesn't really matter how many friends I have, and it doesn't really matter how much I talk to everybody. Nobody really cares about anything anymore, so why should I care about stuff others don't care about? Well I do, because I care. Now, caring about careing sounds a liitle odd, and you are all probably thinking "what is Tom smoking?" but no, I am have a strong theory. When you care about things, you think about them, which usualy makes you depressed. Think about that for a second, if you care you are thinking about it, which makes you depressed, unless you are one of the lucky ones where the person you care about cares about you. But other than that, you get depressed. Now, because you care, you keep thinking, so the best thing to do is to care about caring. Care for your care, keep caring about caring, and eventually you will care for nothing, only caring for others. Does that make sense? Perhaps I should draw a diagram.     Does that make some sort of sense? Simply, if you care about caring, you care for all, if you care for one, you only care for one.

       I'm here ma Chris friend!! I thought I had alread blogged todayt but i just have imagiuned it! Strange, eh? Anyway, i guess thaty's why I'm at home, cos I don't know what I'm doing today! Nah, I did take the day off not because I am ill, but I couldn't face over 2 hours with a certain tecaher, but I can't even remember her name now! Silly me. But anhway, thursday afternoon i will be happy and smiley JO (or as happy and smiley as I get, ha ha), and I will be until parents evening, when meine mutti is gonna turn the tables on that teacher whose name I can't remember, and i don't remember what she said to me yesterday either. It's all done and dusted.  So, basically I went back to bed having got up for breakfast, and slept in until about  10am, got up and wandered around for a bit. Had lunch at 12,  toastie cheese!!!  Um, then did a bit more of nothing, then watched neighbours, then put some very loud Eric Clapton on in my lounge, until my mum came home. She actually suprised me today, cos she thought I was actually ill, wheraas my dad got suss straight away (usually he doesn't pay any attention to my 'illnesses', but today he came to 'chat' cos he knew I wasn't ill). However, he wasn't cross or nething, I just said that I was entitled to take days off now and then, and he said as long as I am not gonna start doing it all the time, like a certain other member of my family. Ahem. So yeah., I oh crap. no. I was about to say I have just come back form my music lesson and am cooking my tea, when I suddenly remeber that I put my potato in the oven, and never took it out again. So I now have a very solid baked potato. Never mind. Charcoal, all the same. Um, and I am off to panto and 7.30, to help shift scenery around! I shall be doing that all thsi week, so I won't be on messengert after 7.30 every evening, nor will I be blogging or answering my e-mails. Just to warn you, in case you think I have all dissappeared.   not that ne one would notice, of course.    So, see you tomoorrow guys. I think it will be safe to put in an appearance tomoorow. As long as I am not going to be head hunted.

       Well boy did I have a bad day. Although you could say bad afternoon really. The whole us lot getting banned from the tech block has really peed me off, I mean, we don't exactly trash the place!!!!!!! Grrrrr. Where are we suposed to go now though huh? Our old corner? Thats a bit cold and wet. Ew. Fair enough if it were sunny but helooooooo this is england! We don't do sun! Much. Then bloody Chris in english flicking that candy off those candy necklasses thing. He was trying to hit Lee but got me instead an dit bloody well stung like mad. If I had looked up just at that moment it would've got me in the eye. Then when I anwsered Sir's questions and it took like ten minutes just for people to write it down. Geez. Now I am cream-crackered and wondering where our Jo has gone. Jo? Where you ma Freddie friend? And Jackie, I got ma Here On Earth DVD! Yay.

       Hello peeps, I am alive.  I do love this time of the evening. My father is sitting in the kitchen with some nuts and a beer, surfing the internet and writing e-mails. My brother is watching some strange programme from the 1980s on the Sci-Fi channel about this guy who can burn things with his hand (ouch?) and my mother is reading the newspaper and drinking her tea in bed - and this happens every single night. What do I do? Well I sit in here and type away on this thing all night before going to bed.  This is quite an interesting question you ask of us Nicki, our honeymoon? Well that is kind of asuming that we get married, and having a girl friend in the first place. So in a dream world lets say... First of all, the honeymoon. Well, as much as I loved Paris and other places like Prague, I would prefer to be somewhere unique for my honeymoon. I will explain all in the morning, it's too late. For my wife? Well let me make one thing quite straight, after previous experiences in that line of feild, she has to be more inteligent and an ape. I will explain the rest tomorrow as well.  Or I could be gay?

       Ollie has shoved a pen in her leg before...  Honeymoon, eh? Hmmm, I think a nice week or two in the Caribbian with you-know-who would be very nice. Need I say more?  Cinema. Im gonna have to think about that one. If its going to be organised so late that its gonna be during the half-term, I cant come because I will be in America.  P.S: Tom seems perfectly fine. I passed him on the way to geography today, and we both made a strange noise when we passed. Insane as usual. I think he is just doing his homework and coursework, which reminds me....english homework has to be in tomorrow! Aaaaa, look at the time! Byebye.

       Oliverb oudlin is well evil, he stuck a pen in my back today ! but i suppose i better tell you the whole story ! I mangaed to get his password and was then logging in so he turned my computer off, i did this twice and then it said that contact eh operating person cause his grace log ins had run out ! So he was pretty angry and then he shoved a pen into my back ! it well hurts now ! :( Well slightly later after our lesson i slapped him round the face cause he tried stabbing me again ! hehe well anyway a honeymoon, well no where cause im not ever gonna get married cause no one would eva fancy me or would want to go out with me

       Um, honeymoon would have to be somewhere quiet and romantic, maybe the middle east or somewhere (an Island of Thailand maybe?), as there are clear waters, nice sun, beautiful scenery, and you could just do nothing for 2 weeks or whateva! Would be bliss, I bet! And my perfect man would be tall, dark and handsome, with a wicked sense of humour, kind, inteligent and motivated!! COuldn't stand someone who just sits of hsi bum all day and never does anything! How about you, Nicki? AND answer it with no references to Ryan, Josh HArtnett or Chris Klein!!! Or anyone else famous, for that matter! Pure fiction here, deary!

       Hey Jackie, it's the mother of all stomach aches!!!!! Anyways, Tom didn't blog last night/this morning which is very unusual indeed. He better be at school today or I will get seriously worried. I hope it is simply that he hasn't had the time.  So onto maybe more fun topics, if you guys (and girls, heehee) could go anyway and I mean anywhere for your honeymoon where woul dyou go? Ooo, and who would your perfect husband/wife be?

       He hasn't really been on MSN all week, nor has he been on it since friday, both of which I find quite bizarre. Also, he usually blogs every day, and I don't think he has been on snooboo for a day or two. Hope he hasn't lost the will to live already, we're not supposed to do that until we actually get our GCSE results. No, I'm joking, where the hell is he? Hope everything's okay. I will come and see 8  mile if other peeps r going too!

       The blue writing is a link, for example  urlLink this blue writing here is a link to the bbc if u click on it . Does that answer one question? NAd btw, haven't a clue what safe mode is! On the other hadn, it looks like safe mode shows u the HTML of the page, so for example you can see the link written out properly, and each line break has the html for the line on it (minus the space, of course) . I think.

       S'all good. Freddie Prince Junior, I'm on my way to ya honey!!! Wooooooooooooohhhhhhhhoooooooooooooooooooo!!! OMG OMG OMG OMG. OKay, Sorry. Got tat outta ma system now I can calm down abit. Right right. I've just bought a load of books in a shop in caterham, cos I am gonna try and learn some Spanish before I go on holiday. I bought one of those CD-rom teaching type thingys this morning, but it doens' tell you the alphabet or the numbers or anything as basic as that, so I just went and got an everyday phrase book (typical touristy thing) and a voccab tool book. Whilst I was there I als found the last book in a series of superb books that I have read, and I bought a german phrase book for my trip to Austria with the music department! Das ist kaputt.Look at this:  "Eine Ruckfahrkarte erster Paris, bitte" how silly is that? Aking for a train ticket to a place in france, in german. Right. And don't say you can get a train from Germany to PAris, it is a bloody long way and would be a bit silly to do! Spiegeleier mit Zuckererbsen, bitte. Ha ha ha!!Die nummer funktioniert nicht. Ich habe verstopfung!! Ooooh!! I bet you canm guess that last one just by looking at the last word 'verstopfung! Achtung vor dem Hund!!! Mquah ha ha ha. OKay, I'm sorry, I'll shut up. It's just that, well, um, you see............. FREDDIE PRINCE Jnr!!!! and of course, for Nicki- CHRIS KLEIN!!!

       Chewing food is generally a good idea Nicki. I found that a while ago when I got a slice of salami rammed sideways down my throat. Not funny.  Anyway, the London thingy, I would love to go, just my mum won't book it cos she always ends up booking the tickets for things, and she has a lot to pay off on her credit card at the mo, oweing to Chrsitmas and our next holiday and all!

        Am I right in thinking this is a blog where you put down your feelings and stuff that has happened during the day?  Yes. That is right. The reason I don't want people slagging each other using the blog is because that is all that will happen. People will just sit here and diss people. If I let you and Max slag each other off now then you wouldn't be talking probably, ie: your previous post. You'd still be slagging each off. Fair enough if people don't get along but slagging each other off all the time isn't gonna help. I should know, just look at Lisa and I! Do you see where I'm coming from?  I am putting off my history coursework until tomorrow. Its all confused me, i don't feel we have done enough work on it. I mean for our Vietnam one we did like a terms worth of research etc.. So far we've had what, five/four lessons on it? Well. Tsktsk. And Jo, I relaly hope we can sort out that London thingy. I get hyper whenever i think about it! Heehee. And can we move the Imperial war Musuem trip to the next inset day? Ii am away at half term. Thats a point, what is everyone doing at half term? I'm off up to Norfolk to see my Auntie! Her house is so lovely. Actually, hers and Andy's are simelar! OMG, guess what I did thsi morning. I nearly choked to death [no, seriously I relaly nearly did!] on CORNFLAKES!!!!! That is outrageous! A few saturdays ago I nearly choked on a piece of rice while watching you've been framed and the evening before that I managed to get a chunk of chocolate stuck in my throat. I really should chew my food.

You should only be doing the full course if you have spoken to Mr.Parr about it. If not, complain.  Well, this will be my last blog of the week, as I will be going to America. See you folks!

       Then all of a sudden, a pellet goes flying through the animals head, sending him straight off the fence and into next doors pond. Looking across the garden, Andy is hiding there with his air rifle...       Wot a tosspot, killing foxes.  Fat Boy Slim is sad, all todays music is rubbish. Even my favourites like Puddle Of Mudd are total rubbish compared with Pink Floyd and other 80's rock.  Anyways, Ive got my job as a part time computer engineer! Yay! Ugh, the first task they set me was the one I hate the most. Replacing a hard drive and getting all the damn settings correct.

       I had a close encounter with one of the members of the fox family who live at the end of our garden. I think it was the daddy fox. Anywho, I was in the kitchen and he jumped onto the fence like our cats do as they jump from the drive to the patio. I mean this huge great big fox was on the fence! Amazing creature. He is in really good condition with a fluffy tail and a really nice orangy red coat. And he has huge ears!!! And lovely blue eyes. It was a bit scary when he looked dead at me though.

       That does explain it indeed. I haven't watched any of it yet. In fact I don't tend to watch particular channels, its the programs I'm after. Thinking about it now the channel I watch a lot is E4 with such great programs as ER, Friends, Smallville and many many more. Other than that I don't really have many other programs I watch other than The Royal. How fun. I am writing this at school by the way and Tom has a squeaky voice. LOLOLOLOLOL. That was funny eating lunch o 20 minutes ago as Darren and Jackie kept giving each other wedgies. Sooooooooooooo amusing.

       So Max, you don't like Johnny Vaughan? What about Dom Joly? Good stuff from Fat Boy Slim? Well the channel is designed for 20-30 year olds, so that could explain why you don't like it.

       Max watch your language please. Remeber, please only swear if you are extremly angry or peed off like Jackie earlier with his BS lessons. And I think it is up to Jackie what she does about it. I woudl suggest going to talk to Mr Johnston as he does actually do something about it but its her choice what she does. I just hope it works out for the better whatever happens and that what happens in her lessons don't affect her final GCSE grade.   "Halt, who goes there? BAAAAAAAAAA!" That is a quote from a very amusing true film based on the Apollo 11 mission, the film is called 'The Dish'. It is based in Austraila. We have uiton DVD and I think you guys should watch it someday. Put it this way: "Cliff! You just bulls***ed NASA!". Any film which lies to NASA has got to be funny. And anotehr film whcih is the total opposite of The Dish is Drive Me Crazy which I saw in 1999 with Angela. It is a good teen flick, which such lines as: "Well, I guess it's easy to be a bitch now that Brad's availabe again." "It's easy to be a bitch either way." and "Get drunk, have sex, be free... we're the class of '73!" and of course the great "Son are you stoned?" "Dad, wouldn't the correct question be, son are you ill?" along with ""I'm sorry Dave. I would have drove him home but I dunno how to drive a stick." "C'mon baby I'll teach you how....I got a stick right here!" "I meant a real car Eddie not a Matchbox!". HOW AMUSING!!!!!

       Max, you are not allowed to have an opinion of BBC THREE as you can't actually get that channel unless you got digital in the past few days. It is BBC Choice replacement, it has a couple of the programmes like Liquid News and 60 Seconds from BBC Choice, but also quite a few new programmes. It is 90% British made programming.  Also Max if we ski, we all ski together. Ski school is in the morning and afternoon, and if you want to you can ski after that for a little while. The slopes are 30 minute drive from the hotel. I have got 1 dodgy double audio jack and I am trying to buy another one.  Don't you ever get bored of watching The Office?  Jackie, nothing is going to happen unless you talk to somebody about it.

Basically in simple terms...........listen to fat ****, or listen to Bon Jovi :) dont forget The Office is on at about 10:30pm out there :) BBC AMERICA! Talking about the BBC, that new channel 3 is rubbish! And your opinion is........?  Tom, got any double audio jacks to plug into the player for America?

       OOOOOOOOOO lookie. First to blog for today. Well, well, well. Chilli, baby back baby back baby back ribs. And that kinda sums up the day. We repeated that phrase for most of it. LOL. I stayed at school until 5 doing some art courseowrk. But while the teach was working on it for me I cleaned up her side and now it is all nice and neat. Fantabalo. However I did learn today that the RE and German speaking exam clash. So according to Westy those who miss speaking appointments during the exam get to be put in isolation until we have done it so no one can tell us what is in it. Brilliant. I've never been in isolation before.

       I had Kazaa for a little while (1 day) it wasn't really the viruses that I was worried about, but there was just so many adverts and other rubbish it just wasn't worth it.  Guns 'n' Roses - Sweet Child of Mine - have you seen the video to that? Haha! It was made when filming the camera crew filming the video was popular, and they all look like they need the toilet, and they all do stupid little dances when they haven't got anything to do. It's on  urlLink KERRANG!  quite a lot at the moment, look out for it.  If any of you have ever wondered how mice find good sex partners,  urlLink this is how .  Other than that I don't really have a lot to say. Apart from Max, everytime you play You Give Love A Bad Name I will play the Popcorn Dance Remix. Now, You Give Love A Bad Name is a great song, don't get me wrong, and Bon Jovi rules, but I have heard it enough times to last me 'till the Summer. So, Max, this is your warning. You Give Love A Bad Name vs Popcorn Dance Remix. If any of you haven't heard Popcorn, or the remix, just ask for a CD and I will give it to you. It's cool the first time, but after that, it's just pants. I do have another song somewhere which I made with some dodgy music software that I will have to put onto CD for the trip.  Hey guys! Are we already for some  urlLink Spice ? "All five Spice Girls are reported to be meeting up on Monday for the first time in five years. Some pop insiders are even claiming that the once-legendary girl group will talk about reforming." Own up ladies, who was a Spice Girls fan in the '90s? I know I was! Don't be shy Max... you know those footsteps at the begining of Wannabe bring back good memories.

       Those 'Simple Minds'  tracks are my favourites! www.kazaa.com is where to go for it. I have not downloaded a single virus off there (not without intentionally looking for it!!!) If you havent already got a virus checker, you can download a good one off kazaa (like mine :), or I can copy mine to a cd for ya. (Norton Anti-Virus 2003). My fave guns'n'roses track is 'Dont Cry'. Kewl song. Heavy. I like almost everything 80's. Mostly the pop/rock part. New pop is just a loada bollox (capital fm, kiss, etc are rubbish. I listen to Virgin radio)

       I have to take life more as a joke? Omg. I am not even gonna reply to that.   "We say that the time of death cannot be foretold, but in saying this we assume that it is hidden in some obscure moment in the not too distant future, never realising that it has any connection with the day already begun, this very day that is so certain, and has every moment planned in advance." "CARTER YOU DICK!!!!" "Because of you I am still alive, Thank you." "Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay." "Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me." "Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked up God to take down this plane...A REALLY fucked up God." "Well FUCK DESTINY!!!!!!!!!!" "You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by it's tail. Every single move we make,from the mundane to the monumental...the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of...is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave. " "You don't even want to fuck with that, mack daddy!"

       Dont copy them from vinyl, get KaZaA and download em, you have broadband, so it shouldnt be a problem. Forget the illegalness :) of it because I have been doing it for yonks and the police are after FBI hackers, not general home users. Makes sense.  Hm, get some Nickelback on those CD's!!! As well as the Bryan Adams album "Reckless". Some specific Pink Floyd tracks perhaps, loadsa Bon Jovi as well.  Tom doesnt seem to know how much I will be plugging "You give love a bad name" on the ski trip......

       How do you know someone has seen Final Destination 2? They msn sign in name is: DEATH IS COMING. lol. Some of us went to see it earlier. Dave, Rich and Max got ID'ed and couldn't in! How rude! There was a bunch of year 9's in there because we saw Doe's bro. That is outrageous. Even Jackie got asked her age. Bless. Anywho, thsi is the review type of thing from the official site, if you haven't seen it and want to don't read, its a spolier, slightly:  For every beginning there is an end…  Final Destination 2, the sequel to the hit 2000 supernatural thriller, finds Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) the only survivor of the crash of Flight 180 left alive. Locked away by her own choice in the perceived safety of a psychiatric hospital, Clear now lives in constant terror that Death is coming to claim her, as it did all her friends. Clear may be considered crazy, but she's not wrong. Death is moving toward suburban Route 23, heading south.  En route to a weekend getaway with her friends, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) watches helplessly as a logging truck careens out of control and loses its deadly payload, setting off a horrifying chain reaction that leaves twisted metal and dead bodies in its wake – including her own. A moment later, Kimberly finds herself still stuck in on-ramp traffic, with a line of commuters she saw die moments before trailing behind her. It was only a vision. But was it also a warning? Shocked into action, Kimberly blocks the cars from joining the traffic on Route 23 as a young police trooper (Michael Landes) arrives on the scene. The commuters begin to honk and complain …until Kimberly’s premonition comes powerfully and tragically to life before their eyes.  Death tears up the highway in a massive pile-up, with those left on the onramp narrowly escaping with their lives. But Kimberly knows it’s not over. Death won't be cheated so easily. Now this random group of strangers, who in Kimberly’s vision were all meant to die in the freeway disaster, must join her in a thrilling race against time and their own paralyzing fear to do what all but one of the survivors of Flight 180 couldn't – stay alive.  New Line Cinema presents Final Destination 2, from the same producing team behind the original film, Warren Zide and Craig Perry (American Pie I-III, Cats and Dogs), with Justis Greene (Mission to Mars, I’ll Be Home for Christmas) serving as Co-Producer. Noted second unit action director David R. Ellis (whose work has been seen in such films as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, The Perfect Storm and the upcoming Matrix Reloaded) directs from a screenplay written by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, based on the story by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress and Jeffrey Reddick. Returning from the first film are Ali Larter (Legally Blonde, American Outlaws) as Clear Rivers and Tony Todd (Candyman) as the mortician, Mr. Bludworth.

       Well recent posts have been saying something, then on a new paragraph changing subject and thats ok because it works. Its just rather annoying when people press enter as in enter for a new paragraph every time they start a new sentance!!  I am in such a good mood today. I'm not sure why. Lots of reasons I guess such as the fact that I am alive, my hair is curly today, its a nice morning, I'm going out with friends later, one week left until half term, my friends in other countries are so lovely, the pictures website has gone well and its all good as the americans would say. Talking of websites, Dave T has given me co-running the Year 11 Party Pics site, its just been re-done so go and check it out, tell me what you think. There are a few bugs we are sorting out  though.  urlLink Year 11 Party PIctures!!!

       I didnt think much of the new seats. Ok, so they were slightly more comfortable, but they didnt need to buy them.  I dont blog too often because there is nothing to blog about, I tend to say my own opinion on what someone has said (like i just did above). I got one valentine card, from Nic.J (can tell by the handwriting). I will blog once every two or three days, as there is no need to blog everyday. I just come on sometimes to look at recent posts.  The film will be good tomorrow, but I need to walk to Daves first (cant b assed to get the bus!) YAY! Then on Sunday i'm going bowling/croydon with Nic.J!!

I'mtrying, Jackie is trying so come on Tom, Jo and Max, blog!!!!!!!!!!  I didn't get any cards either not that I am bothered because I personally think v-day is a load of cobblers! Its just another excuse to feel special and for people to make money. So for people who don't get anything its worse. :( Anywho, I can't wait for tomorrow! I will probably hide behind someone during the film, I'm sure i'll get scared I always do when I see horror movie type of things! What did ya'll think of the new seats in assembly? Snazzy!!!!!!

       It was a story a teacher from my juniors school use dto say that she was in a feild, lost her car keys, asked God for them, looked down and there they were. There is also the story of the onion but I won't go into that now. I don't know why people aren't blogging, Tom has already he is busy so fair enough but Jo hasn't said anything so I may have to email her a warning saying that she needs to blog soon. I went to the careers convention at school earlier. Very helpful it was!!! I was chatting away to the lady at the army desk for about 20 minutes!!!!!!!! Then I spoke to the RAF for a while. Fantabulous.

And i dont commit myself to just oging with one person if i get another offer then i will go, i went with darren. Maybe you should set a date early then i wouldnt have gone to see that with darren i would of seen sometihng else. You gotta get in tehre early with me cause i go to the cinema all the time even if there is only me and darren.

       I'm suprised no one else has blogged today. Shocking. Max, that is short sighted I believe where you can see things up close but have trouble with things far away. Which is ok for driving I guess, not that any of us can drive officially yet.  Actually I'm really annoyed right now, I know that a number of you went to see 'Catch Me If You Can', I am led to believe Jackie and Jenny went. Thank you both of you, I guess people really don't listen to me, I'll repeat what I said to you both in January: 'I want to go see Catch Me If You Can, shall we go together in February' and you both said 'sure'.  Thank you, you have both just proved my point on how  no one listens to me .

        talking about RE (Ms Auld is a RE teacher) and she was sooooo enthusiastic about it my mum and I both kept on looking at each other smiling because we where both thinking the same thing, she wants some good grades in her department.  Same for Mr.Hanson. Its like "oh, how is he doing in the I.T". Hehe.  Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school?  Probably Andy or Dave, Nic.J as well.  Ive forgotten what kinda sight ive got. I can see close up things easily, but looking far away looks really blurred.

        Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school?  That depends on what I do when I finish collage or uni. If I join the army then I would probably only keep in contact when I get leave etc... But other than that I like to think I'd keep in contact with Jenny, and Andy.   I had my opticians appointment today. very scary stuff. I am long sighted and have to get some glasses for doing school work etc.. They should arrive in roughly a week they said. The glasses are pretty nice. I think they make me look intelligent, ish. I am feeling relaly left out at the moment from our group. I know I am ill and that I couldn't go out even if someone asked me because I don't want to make my cold worse but no one even invites me anywhere. Although i must hand it to Jackie, as I talk to her now on msn she is inviting me to a film. I think.

       Well i didnt meet either of my targets from last year in fact i have got worse, and Tom at least you didtn have miss auld moaning at you saying how bad you did in ur RE test ( I got an F). Most of my grades from last year have gone down but i beleive that is cause last yea it was what we were attaingin in lessons not in bloddy exams when your under pressure ! I think these acedemic review days are a total waste of time espically for ur parents cause most of the time they just sit there and dont acually say anything unless they have a load of questions to ask. I got a phone call half way through my interview but me being good ignored it ! This years targets are to improve my science result to a B and to make a Structured revision plan and STICK to it ! lol Sod both of those targets ! Anyway enough said about bloodly school, i went to the cinema today to see catch me if you can, no offence nicki but it was quite boring although the storyline was good, it lacked action in my opinion but some films are like that so im not gonna complain. Question for you all : Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school? For me probably Darren buts thats cause we live so close to each other Anyway byebye

       Can't remember last years targets, and I can't remember this years targets. So good luck getting those sorted then. We spent 10 minutes talking about AS/2, how my GCSEs are doing, which subjects need what doing to them and then we spent the other 10 minutes talking about RE (Ms Auld is a RE teacher) and she was sooooo enthusiastic about it my mum and I both kept on looking at each other smiling because we where both thinking the same thing, she wants some good grades in her department. I think I might just write "Jesus" 400 times on the exam and see what happens.

       I met, ready, both of mine! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!! Now I basically have to attend maths and IT revsion clubs along with textiles and art clubs AND other revison clubs including science. Argh! When will these clubs end? Especially as they haven't begun!   Anywho, right now I am multi-tasking!! I am writing a blog here, writing a blog for my austrailan type o one I am on, talking to 2 people on msn, watching last nights ER for the second time, drinking a chocolate milk shake (and may I say how marvelous it is) and wiating for a text. Ooo! I texted Paul (aka the Walrus) earlier saying 'aww bless, hes cute even when he is talking to his form tutor'. But I cunningly text him when he went in for his talk thing! Mwahaha. Bet he didn't have his phone with him. Mind you, you'll only understand that last line or so if you post on the snooboo.com forum.  I am trying my hardest to be in a cheery mood and it seems to be suceeding, even though I'm ill and I wil keep reminding everyone of that until I get the sympthay I want. LOL.

       I had met one of my targets from last year, which was to improve my maths. My other target was to get the science grade up. Didnt acheive that.  This years targets.... 1. To sustain the maths grade 2. To get grade up in science 3. To continually read books for English  *Sticks finger up for No.3*

       I have got no idea who the first person on my MSN Messenger list was. What did I do today? Cleaned cars - do I have to go into detail? Yes? Okay... We cleaned cars to raise money for our trip to Brazil in 2004. Sarah, Sophie, Law, Christable, Helen, Andy, Owen, Matt and myself. Neil didn't turn up, well he did at the begining for his meeting and then went home. We cleaned lots of cars and got very wet and cold, but it was good fun and it will be worth it in the end.  According to researchers, people bring good fortune on themselves by following four basic rules: maximising opportunity; acting on intuition; anticipating good fortune; and taking an optimistic long view of life.  Ha.

        Who was the first ever person on your MSN contact list?  Dave T.  What a wonderful day I have had since this morning. Althugh I am still as ill as a foot and mouth ridden cow I have survived the day to London, thank God for Lockets!!! Ah dudes!!!!! It was soooo much fun! Me and Dave had a good laugh and our seats in the theatre were excellent, about 6 rows from the front. the show itself 'Contact' was excellent. The lights, stage, script, costumes, dance was brilliant!!! I have found a new found love for a) going to the theatre and b) swing dancing. Fabbo. Now I can't wait for 'This Is Our Youth' Jo, now I know more of what to expect at a theatre I am not as nervous so: FREDDIE AND CHRIS!!!! WAHOOOOOOOO!

       Tom, grow your hair. I would like to see what you look like "Sam McEvilly" (sp?) style. :)  At the moment, my only letdown is a huge ulcer on my tongue. I bit it in english the other day with a loud "crunch". I cant eat at all. I dont get hungry. Oh well, saves on the shopping bill at least.

       Tom, your hair. I think, from my fashiony designery point of view that you should go for something different. Perhaps get it highlighted and than the sides a bit shorter than the top then you can do a bit of a mohegan (sp?), a bit like Joe Armfeild, perhaps.   I had the worst night last night. I woke up at midnight because Dave text me damm him!!! 4am and 6am. I ended up getting up this morning at 8.30am. Darn it. If we were at school today I would not be going in I tells ya. I have a bloody sore throat, a stuffy erughy nose, stuffed ears (everything is muffled) and I am cream-crackered (knackered). Argh, I hate bing ill but I am going out today anyway. Lets hope I don't cough or anything too loudly in the theatre. LOL. Have a fun academic review day everyone.

Having your hair the same every single day is getting a bit boring, some people have never changed their hair style since year 7! Not metioning any names *cough* David *cough*. So guys, how should I have my hair?

       My day today: ok bearing in mind I am ill with a sore throat that is murder to me.  Anyone notice how I've been strangely happy though? I don't just spend my days depressed etc... Well I think I have figured why! I have been wearing this necklcae which is a happy face which I got free as a gift from the Hard Rock Hotel I stayed in. I'm always happy when I wear it. Check my hotel out  urlLink here !! Its was so awesome, the swimming pool has an underwater sound system and every few nights they have like a DJ at the pool or a dive-in movie/concert. They showed Harry Potter when I was there. Excellent. Love it!!!

            urlLink      This is Big Brother. The application process for Big Brother 4 is now closed. Ladies and Gentlemen, prepare your selfs for another summer of complete and utter rubbish.  I'm sorry, but the first time was quite interesting. It was new, it was a bit of a laugh, it was okay - but this is getting silly. Please, not another summer of strange freaks in a house trying to prove them selves to be somebody they are not. It ain't good TV anymore. What is good TV? Well the new channel BBC Three is sounding quite a good idea. Fat Boy Slim is having his own programme, should be very good. BBC Three's indents are made up of this strange creature called Blob (the guy on the left) - it's a bit odd, but if you want to watch the indents, there are  urlLink available here . Clip 3 is a bit dareing, and the BBC will probably get lots of complaints, but never mind. Anyway, if you are interested, BBC Three launches on Sunday 7th February 2003 at 7pm.  Unfortunatly nothing exciting is happening to my life, it just seems to be everybody else with the "fun" (as they call it). So I really haven't got anything to say, I might as well live in a ditch. However, we do have something to keep us going...   four day weekend!   but I am washing cars for money to go to Brazil! So it's all good really.  Jo, you asked me about the different sized text? I have made you all a little guide to explain size etc  urlLink here . Any other questions, just ask!  G'night peeps!

I love that program, the newer ones are better I think. Although the old ones are funny in the sense that the Pete characters says 'mate' an awful lot. Perhaps he is related to Mr Dicks? Talking of Mr Dicks him and Westy have taken all teh text bokos leaving Mr Bradwell or whatever his name is 2. LOL. How amusing.

I know talking about war etc.. isn't happy but it is now and it is to do with us, with our generation. If we all posted everyday going on 'o wasn't this lesson wonderful, I learnt so much! Lunch was funny' etc... then it would be so boring! And I mean BORING. Whereas at least with this we can also have a good debate and not just a silly argument.

       I know you hit me deliberatly around the head, that is why I said  'a reflex action for you hitting me delibaratly around the head' . Yea I said stuff but that is because of your attitude to this. After a few days I'm sure I'll stop, I always do unless your Lisa. Fair enough if you have been brought up like that but just because thats how your parents act doesn't mean you should too. You know you are your own person, not just some clone of others.

       Ah, now Nic is a person I love, you are correct in assuming I will be very upset if something like that was to happen. I did not know the people in that shuttle, so ok, my deepest sympathy goes out to their families. The space program can go to hell, what is the point in bringing little insects like mice into space?  I have been brought up not to care about much, i.e: I have had to sleep in a broken bed all my life apart from when I was in a cot or whatever it is called. I am told to shut up and put up about it. I have to live with that sort of attitude, so I personally grow up with it.  In case you are wondering, I hit you deliberatly around the head because you had constantly been talking about me in science and playing some card game and saying "Max is the arsehole", not forgetting you threw that thing that Andy had  twice  at me.

       Actually, you will only be removed for the following reasons:   If you use a large amount of swearing for no apparent reason   You are quite blantently aggravating people, on purpose   You don't post at all over a period of 2 - 3 weeks even after I have emiled of reminded you to blog  Just because I disagree with what you said doens't mean I'll chuck you off. I'd like to hear what other people think on it. By the way Max, I didn't mean to kick you earlier it was a reflex action for you hitting me delibaratly around the head. So what would I like your views on? Well, I found out late about Columbia and when I was talking to Max about it all he said was 'o well shit happens'. I find that very disrespectful and rude. Its isn't everyday a space shuttle which was on a very important mission is destroyed and its crew killed. I could understand if it were a car accident because they do happen everyday. Put it this way Max, (and to Nic or anyone else I don't mean to upste you or be rude) if someone you cared about, ie Nic, was killed weather it be a car accident or not you would be extremly upset and greviving and would not want people tos hurg and go 'o wel;l, shit happens'. Thats like saying it doesn't matter. Ist like their deaths don't matter, or the crash itself doesn't matter. What about their families? 4 of them were married, what about their children? They have to grow up without a dad and that is something extremly hard to do. Then theres the space program itself, that will be put on hold now for a long long time. There are people in space now from Russia. The space station, also a very important project, what will happen to that? This has an on going affect, its isn't just 'shit happens'.  Argh, why don't you guys think before you say things?  -edit- Excuse me Jo? How can you come on here saying how all we talk about is depressing stuff when throughtout today and past week or so whenever I talk to you your always depressed! And you never give me a reason either!  "You can't go around being all depressed all the time, life goes on"  ha, thats a bit rich isn't it. I thought we were good frineds, so how come you never talk to me.

        I would just like to point out Max that BBC News is paid for by you because you own a TV  Check mate... mwhahaha   Not quite. I didnt say anything about TV, I was refferring to newspapers. But what you said is still true.  This will probably be my last blog before Nicki chucks me off!

       I would just like to point out Max that BBC News  is paid for  by you because you own a TV  Check mate... mwhahaha   I have newspapers starting from the year 2000 till present day of all important events, local and national - such as Prince Charles riding the tram!  Silence...   Found this from an amusing article called 'How to... study' in yesterdays Gurdian. "Studying is copying things from books, and revising and highlighting the nouns what you have copied. But remember, your teacher probably wrote the book you're copying from, though when you've reduced his life's work to one noun, he might not recognise it."  urlLink How to... study   What did I do today? Well this morning myself and Andy went skiing! But just before that we played with his ferrets, they are soooo smelly! But quite cute. The skiing was very good, soon as Andy worked out how to turn he was fine. Then this evening my family and I went to my grandparents for a meal and to talk about stuff such as house prices. Did you know that a 3 bedroom house in the year 1976 was £17,000? How much did your last car cost? Crazyness.  Anyway, my view on war if it has been said already there is no need to say it again. But seeing has everything has been said I want to say, I bid you good night and sweet dreams - I'm going to have a bath.

       Yes agree with what you are saying nicki but do you not think that they go slighly over board, I know septer the 11th was a very tragic day but do we still need to read about it in the paapers for the next month? I think not all that does is put us in bad moods and makes us afraid of going out, just think darren was in america when that happened ! Here you go nicki it is back again for ya !

       Now isn't this good, we are having a constructive debate nota argumentwhere peopel insult each other while swearing. How nice this is.  Perhaps they do go overboard but things like the recent Columbia crash will affect many things, like September 11th. War on Iraq will constantly be in the papers like it is now I guess but that will have a lasting effect. Some people like myself, like to read everything that happened ie: minute by minute, others don't but they have enough there for everyone I think. Plus your point about darren proves how its godo to know what is going on. Say your sister was in New York when that happened you'd want to know, even if you knew she was ok, what was happening and what was going on. So they are goo din that sense but yes, they do have it on the front page longer than people want to see it. I see your point.   -edit- Jackie just deleted her last post which this was replied to

       I agree Jackie, they do print more 'amusing' stories, or a wider range anyhow. I read the Daily Express. But when something like September 11th or the Columbia tradgey occurs I tend to read the Daily Express, Telegraph etc.. I also keep the papers for that day. I have about a bzillion from September 11th, ranging from the actual day to about a week after, including an OK! magazine. I also figured that when I'm like 70 or someting (if I live that long) my kids / grandkids may be taught about it and I can say 'weel lookie here kiddo'.

       I couldnt care less if "shit happens" was written all over my gravestone because I will be dead and won't know anything about it. The 7 crew members were going in NASA's oldest shuttle and knew their lives were at risk. People die all over the world every day, so what so different about 7 extra people? That is my opinion, I will say nothing more.  I dont read newspapers, whats the point in paying when you have  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/news ?

I cant be bothered to read the Telegraph and papers like that because they are so boring, they only write about very important stuff and dont write about some of the more funny news reports. ok !

       hello, sorry ihavent blogged lately, but im glad you all noticed ! To be honest with you all i reakon the newspapers just print the stroies to get attention, they arnt in it to deliver us news they are in it for money-- How discracefull is that? And to be honest why do they have to print about 12 pages all about how it crashed, why it crashed, when it crashed, who was in it, why they were in it, how their families are coping, pictures of it ( how rude is that) and then not fogeting they then write most of it all over again the next day. I used to read the newspaper every day with out fail but now i tend to read it if there is something good on the front page and then i only read half of the paper cause they write a load of shit in it ! What is the world coming too? Any way sorry bout my rant there just letting off a litlle steam, and id like to say im going naked to the ball ! bye

       I'm sure Jo is fine, didn't she go to see Chicago yesterday with Donna? A highly amusing picture of Andy.  I really can't get over how gay the Daily Star is. Every newspaper I have lokoed at today has the space shuttle on the front weather it be the picture of it breaking up or the crew but its there, theres a story, they are remembering. What does the daily star have? Zoe Ball and Norman Cook. Bloody outrageous and very respectaful. I may write and complian or email the bbc with my view.

Today I went shopping! I bought this really massssive scarf which is nearly as tall as me! I bought some underwear, some cosmetics, and had a good smooch around all my favourite shops - didn't buy an aurful lot because I don't have a lot of money at the moment, especily with a holiday coming up soon.  I have been talking to Andy over MSN for the past few minutes, so here is a screenshot of Andy, wearing a pair of breasts:

       Space Shuttle Columbia destroyed, crew of 7 dead. Returning from a 16 day mission. Debris scattrered over Texas.  A terrible tragedy for America and the space program and what does Max say? Shit happens. In that case if you ever die in a car accident or any other way what will be said on you gravestone? Shit happens. That is so inconsiderate. So fucking rude.

I have also, shockingly, tided up my room! dear god what is the world coming to when I tidy my room! Now I must make a start on my IT coursework after I change my 4 calendars over.

       At least you got told the clocks went forward! I didn't know. Andy picking me up to go clay peigon shooting at 9:30am. Right, so if I get up at 8am, that gives me plently of time to eat, have a shower and perhaps make a start on some homework. Did that work? No! I woke up at 9am (8am GMT to what my alarm was set) and I had half an hour to do everything in. Crazyness. Anyway, the clay peigon shooting was brilliant! I did actually shot a fair few, but that shotgun does kickback quite a bit. Spent the rest of my day doing maths coursework, oh how exciting.

       Gunshot as you are more likely to die quickly so it wont be as painfully, plus there will be less blood as a knife is sharp and it is worse. So there byebye

       It is a pretty cool room, one of the best teachers and it's the biggest room. I have cleaned up some of my New York photos that don't look crap because I used a film my brother hadn't re-wowned properley so I used it. You will see white things and parts of buldings and coaches in the background of the photos, and I have taken out the horrible bits.  urlLink Here they are.  All rubbish, but I tried.

       Right, this is just stupid. Some stupid nutter is doing road works at the end of my road, and it's quater to 1 in the morning! I am going outside to have a look...  ..I think it's Croydon Council, but really, why now? There are other through paths, you really don't need to be digging up the road at this stupid hour.

       I can (sort of) do line vectors, but that's as far as I can go. You're right, you did say "Donna and I" I miss read, being worn out by my two cousins who are staying with us this weekend. Yesterday we went to Godstone farm, today we went to the park! Ah the joys... That restruant does sound like a good idea - what kind of food is it?

       Hang on a minute Jo - Donna had a massive pudding? Donna? Only the photos will show the truth! The dinner was good, and yes I was staring into middle distance rather a lot.  For the ball, I am still deciding between a suit or a dinner jacket - can't decide, what do you think?

       The meal woz brilliant, the food woz really nice and it definatly filled you up ! Only  thing i was a annoyed about is the bit where Angela's boyfriends Simon walked out cause Darren woz flirting with Angela ! Also we were stuck down the slightly boringer end of the table so we couldnt get in to the convosation as much... After the meal woz good as well cause we managed to get into the Bowling and arcade bit, we had a few goes on the arcade then most people left. Me and Darren couldnt leave until half 11 because that was when the Taxi was booked for, so we wne tinto the bar and ordered some alcoholic drinks ! Somehow we managed to get served even though not one of us looked over 18 !! It was just me, darre, emma, helen, penny left by this time ! We all look the youngest so im really surprised we got served. Unfortuantly it didnt last for long and a bouncer came over and told us to get out of the bar and to leave our drinks becasue we couldnt prove we were over 18 ! We didnt mind though cause we were oging to leave in bout 5 minutes anyway. I think that is the best night out i have ever had, but i suppose thats cause i dont go out very often ! Lol, what a sad life i lead !  Anyway today woz fun !!! NOT i went to croydon with Goff and Darren, David was meant to come but in the end he didnt so it was a bit of a nightmare ! Goff was looking for shoes for the ball which she found but only after 4 hours and it was in a shop we visitied when we first got into Croydon ! Arghhhh. She was quite funny at times though, like when we were going to the bus stop we saw out bus was at the stop bso me and darren started to run to catch it, but Goff said she couldnt run so i said well walk quickly then so she speeded up by  about 2mm per second! Luckily we got the bus cause there were lots of people geting on it so it didnt pull away. What was more funny was when we were actually on the bus it started to move before Goff had sat down and she neally fell over !!!!!!!! I had to grab her hand and pull her to a seat. I nearly wet myself laughing ! And in the entire shopping trip i didnt buy one thing ! Anyway thats enogugh of me for one day so bye bye see ya Monday

We ahev problems here we need to sort out, we had a bit of a domestic last night. Lots of shouting. My dad no has to work a 12 hour shift instead of he usual 7 hour. Fair enough with the war and all, they need heightened security. I hope this weekend turns out for the best.  Please spare some throughts for the 12 who died in the copter crash and the one american marine who was KIA today and their famillies.

The Home Office do like to keep us informed with helpful tips, such as  urlLink Do I need to buy a gas mask or protective suit to protect myself from chemical or biological threats? And do I need to stockpile food, water, or anything else?   Anywho... Thomas is very busy at the moment because he is becoming increasingly paronoid about himself and all this work he has to do.

       Hey-ho. Well, hopefully they can avoid using weapons of mass destruction, they barely scraped by with the Cuban Missiles Crisis. Its out of our hands, just hope it gets sorted quickly. And I'm not that worried about war anymore. Well I am, I'm worried for all those soliders out there who could get killed at any moment. You see I figure why worry about it if we can't do anything directly? Its gonna happen, just hope its over with asap. I wouldn't worry too much anyway, the Iraq army would fold under the British and American. I probbaly sound quite 'oh I don;t care' but I do, I do care alot about this situation but there isn't anything I can do!!!!!! I wnat to but there isn't anything.   How are you all?  Very well thanks!  Have you all got your stuff for the ball?  I have my dress but that's it.  And are you looking forward to Natalies and Darrens party?  I'm not going but I hope ya'll have a great time!  And is it just me or are you finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the work set and coursework and stuff, i find it soo boring and i just feel like: Whats the point ! But maybe thats just me being lazy ! LOL   I totally agree!!!!!!!!!

       Is it just me or are you feeling slightly worried about war? If BUSH is going on about how they have waepons of mass destruction, doesnt that mean if we attack him he will use them? Just think of hiroshima, all tehm people dies, we are close to london and that is gonna be the main place for an attack? They would get the royals and all the cabinit as well ! Im slightly afraid that if this war goes ahead then we are gonna alll die and painfully as well ! Not to make you all feel bad but im just slightly worried ! LOL Well anywho we better live our lives to the full now cause we mite not be aound for much longer With Love jackie ! x x x x x x Anywho Back to more exciting matters ? How are you all? Have you all got your stuff for the ball ? And are you looking forward to Natalies and Darrens party? I sure am cause its gonna be fun dont ya think ? And is it just me or are you finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the work set and coursework and stuff, i find it soo boring and i just feel like: Whats the point !

       Finaly! I'm on a computer, wow. Spent most of my evening staring at my music coursework hopeing that a melody will pop out from somewhere and write its self onto a page - no such luck so far.  What a day hey? Robin Cook (British Cabinet minister and Leader of the House of Commons) resigns, UN staff at the Kuwait-Iraq border move out along with all UN staff inside Iraq. Russia and Portugal tell their staff to leave Iraq while diplomatic staff from other countries begin to leave the country. George W. Bush is going to issue a speach tonight where he will make a final ultimatum to Saddam. We are going to war. Now I ain't gonna go on about this for ages, but I am starting to be pro-war. If we stop now, he's just going to come after us in future years and probably cause a lot of damage. The people in Iraq are in great trouble and need help, what can we do? Sit around and wait to get blown up or gased, or actually stop him before he gets rid of us. Just the ice-cream talking probably, but still.  Now this is pathetic,  urlLink Dogbreath ad is withdrawn , "A TV advertisement featuring a man "vomiting" up a live dog has been pulled after record complaints from viewers ... chewing gum manufacturer Wrigley's decided to withdraw the advertisement, for its X-cite brand of gum, after watchdog Independent Television Commission (ITC) received more than 700 complaints ... 'Parents have been complaining that their children are scared by it, and some of the adults have said they were actually sick themselves after watching it'." I'm sorry, but that is pathetic, that advert is not disgusting or horrible, you barely even see anything at all apart from a dog jumping out of somebodies mouth. It isn't sick, and it's a fairly amusing advert. It didn't make me laugh, but at least it isn't as dull as Persil or a debt helper.  Anyway, this  urlLink Steve Bell cartoon  sort of sums up todays events to a certain extent. G'night.

       Jo you little f**k. What the f**k have you been f**king smoking or you just f**king high on f**king fear? You f**k.  Yes, sorry, problems with blogger this morning. All sorted now. Yes, yesterday. Ah, yesterday. Fond memories. An educated hour or so wandering around art galleries, taking in some culture. Especially that of the Tudors whose paintings all look the same. Then a five minute brisk walk through a rather pathetic peace protest. Well, they did try. And we were attacked by a few pigeons and we all now what pigeons mean. Then a wonderfull 2 and half hours of Freddie and Chris. Feel free to take Freddie Jo, Chris is mine. Hehe. I think his hair suited his character. Maybe it will be cut now they have finished the play. Or maybe his next film requires long hair. Who knows. Who knows why Mary owned a little lamb. Who knows.

       Bad moment today. We assembled the PC, and discovered we had incompatible memory. I knew this all along, but my dad didnt want to change the memory for the compatible modules. So he's suffering now. Tomorrow, my dad is going to go all the way to London, because he ignored me, and just to buy a floppy drive and replace the memory modules. (We didnt want a floppy drive at first because we have no use for it, but I need it for schoolwork).

       I got my business studies test results as well, mine being:  Unit A - How Businesses Operate - 23/35 (Merit)  Unit B - How Businesses Develop - 20/35 (Pass) ONLY ONE OFF A BLOODY MERIT! GRRR  Unit C - Business Finance - 25/35 (Merit)  So that wasnt too bad at all, considering I didnt revise for any of them. (Shhh, dont tell Dilley!)  My coursework for that is currently averaging out now to a BB grade. I could get an A*A grade if I put max effort in. I have six weeks :)    SHIT!!!!! AAAAAAAAA Just remembered, Gallaghers homework! bugger it. quarter to ten, erm, ok, plan of action.....have pot noodle, have shower, then do the work in bed. That sounds about right.

       I usualy watch MTV Dance, and quite often there is something interesting on MTV2, MTV Base just sucks and gives me a headache. But MTV for Jackass, a always.  I haven't blogged for ages, don't know why.  My business studies results are as follows... Unit 1 = 29/35 (distinction) Unit 2 = 35/35 (distinction) Unit 3 = 29/35 (distinction) Distinction is the equiverlent to a A/A*, all I have to do now is get me coursework up to distinction level and I will have my A/A*!  Unfortunatly my photos of New York didn't go very well because the film I used was the film my brother used when he went to Germany and he didn't rewind it properley. So I only managed to get 2/25 photos.  urlLink Times Square  and  urlLink a building a couple of blocks away from Times Square . I did have another film which is being processed now, but I can't remember what's on it, I think a photo of the Statue of Liberty's bum (that's all we could see the weather was so bad) and a park.  I have had my teeth operation explained to me. I am quite impressed with my teeth, I have a severe class three case on the top and bottom of the mouth, what ever the means, but it don't sound pretty does it? The whole process takes 2 years from start to finish. Braces for 1 year to align my teeth up straight, and then 2 days in hospital after an operation to move my jaw into the correct place, then back to braces for 6 months to finish is off, then to retainers for however long is needed (normaly 2-3 months). So that sounds like fun, I won't be able to speak for two days! How will I ever cope? Which brings me nicely onto my next point...  ...tomorrow Christy is doing a Sponsered Silence! So I am going to walk up to her and ask her a few questions which she can only respond to by saying "yes" or nothing at all. Mwhahahahhah power.

       HA! I have proof now taht shcool really is bad for your health. I have become slightly ill and the reason why? Instead of going home at the normal 3.35 I don't leave school until 5! Why? Because I stay for art, science, german, textiles and IT. Now i'm all run down and erugh :( And now the Inspectar Calls trip has been canceled I'm very annoyed. Well, at least we get our money back.  So what have I got to look forward to atm? My great friends on message boards I talk to who are teh most lovely people in the world! I am looking forward to Saturday Jo! Woooooooo! (BTW, if you can get dropped at my house at 10.15am or so then my dad can run us both straight up the train station). And I am emailing some people who have seen it so that we may have a chance of meeting Chris and Freddie! Wooooooooo!  What programs do you watch on MTV if you get it? I watch Jackass and MTV Cribbs. Love Cribbs. I was watching O-town!!!!!!!!!! really nice house!

       Curently i am also happy because i got my business studies results back. They are : Unit 1 = 27 (merit) Unit 2 = 29 (distinction) Unit 3 = 25 (merit) I am pretty  happy with that but that unit 1 was a bit annoying because i was 1 mark away from getting a distintion !  Overall i think i will get a B maybe if i try harder i can geet an A ! Yippee. Neway thats all i wanted to say LOL Toodles-  Jackie

       I've decided to re-change my A-level options. Originally, in a perfect world, I wanted to do I.T, Electronics and AVCE Business. But no.... Vinton said I cant do electronics because I am not taking physics. Crap. So instead I chose to do Media Studies instead of Electronics. Now, as I have seen the application form again, I just want to do I.T and AVCE Business. Media Studies will probably not play any part in my life, so there is no point in doing it as it will be in theory 25% more extra work for sod all in return. P.S: I managed to recover 50 pages of Business coursework out of the 75. The other "lost" 25 pages I found in draft form on the schools network. Not bad. I'm getting happier.....slowly.

       Ugh, this week has been so crap. I wont go into detail because there is so much rubbish that I will type. The main reasons are: Nic.J is ill with the flu :( I hope she gets better soon! Tonsa coursework Plus losing around 75 pages of business studies coursework is icing on the cake. I sure damn hope my beloved MS-DOS program can restore the floppy disk, its done 100 times better than all 6 of my Windows data recovery programs! Oh well.

       I was talking to Blackburn the other day and he asked me what changed, why we are going home, and I said nothing. That's not true ya know, I think every things changed. I know I changed. Ya know a friend of mine asked me before I got here, when we were all shipping out, he asked me why are you going to fight somebody else's war? What, do ya all think your all heroes? I didn't know what to say at the time, but if he asked me again I'd say no. I'd say there's no way in hell. Nobody asks to be a hero, just sometimes turn out that way. It's not that i like em or i don't like em- I respect them. Look, these people have no jobs, no food, no education, and no future. i just figure that, ya know, I mean we have two things we can do. We can help, or we can sit back and watch a country destroy itself on CNN. Right? Sometimes people ask me why I do it, they say what are you some sort of a war junky? I dont answer them cuz they will never understand. understand that its just for the man fight next to you. Only the dead live to see the end of the war.

       Any pictures are great guys, we can slot them into the categories or into Misc. We will put them on the site and see how they go, if people really don't like them we will have to take them off but we'll see how it goes. Thanks :)  My weekends plans are simply doing homework and recooperating from Thursday. London is really tiring. Today I did lots of art and watched Black Hawk Down. YES! JOSH HARTNETT IS IN A WAR FILM AND ACTUALLY LIVES FOR ONCE!!!!!! WOOOO!!!!! Yea, so that made me happy but now I am all very patriotic towards the USA. BHD is a true story film and they're motto type o thing: 'Leave no man behind'. Even if they guys were dead they defended them and kept the bodies safe until they could get them out of there. Now that, is honour.

       I took a couple in New York, and I didn't bring my little camera becaus I knew everybody else would bring something - which they did.  urlLink My diary of what happened on our trip, slightly edited.  The weather in NY wasn't good, so the photos I took probably won't come out too well, but I tried. I was going to make more recordings, but I only made one for some reason.  urlLink This is the group on the bus just after we landed.

       Tom, Max, please blog. You have been back for a while now and you have both been online so please find teh time to blog. Don't make me send out the warnings!!!!!!  I had an ok day today although there is one thing which is annoying me. And that is the fact that everyone keeps slagging off Mr G. Ok so he may not conduct the best lessons with his sarcastic comments and stuff but he is a good teacher and if it were between him or Mr M, Mr G would probably get us a better grade in the exam.

       Hello? Anyone out there?  Well I did not have any clue what was going on in our science lesson. To me it was a board of waffle and I sat there feeling like a total plum. So in the case of me being a plum, here is the song from Joey in frineds: "this hand is your hand, this hand is my hand, is that hand your hand? no wait thats my hand!" although in my case perhaps it should be more along the lines of is that brain your brain?

Jo, in your emails siggies you have the url for this blog, you need to take off the www so it is just http://el-bloggo.blogspot.com then it will work properly. Right now I'm doing textiles homework. How incredibly fun. I still have art work to do but it is slightly more enjoyable than usual as I am sticking pictures of Mr Merriman down! Wahoo! Oooooooooo! Jaffa cakes!

       Well today woz ok i suppose escept for the fact that i stayed behind after schoolfor 2 hours doing bloody IT coursework and im doing that again tmor. So help me GOD ! Once again i didnt do one thing in science i didnt even bother to unpack my bag, what joyus fun. I think Mr moore needs to get some control over the class. He never seems to teach us anything becuase he gets sidetracked and ends up chatting to a group of people in the corner dont ya think ? Everybody is getting well excited about leaving, we still have most of next week yet! I cant believe people are already bringing in cameras and stuff. Fair enough people bringing in the boooks for people to write in becuase it takes time to do that. Everybody is just going hyper and it is making me feel left out ! I am already fed up of school and i cant seem to get myself motivated i still have my french homework to do but i cant be bothered so that will be done on the thursday, which in fact is very stupid because there is loads to do ! Ahhhhhhhhh Just to  let you know Mr Moore is the sexiest teacher in the school other than Miss Kay of course ! Well im now off for my dinner cause i am starving and i need some nutrician (soz bout spelling) toodles

Then something else funny happened, and I can't even remember what it was now. DAmmit. But yes, and odd day in all. Boring music leesson, got into trouble for not having done enough work. Yipeee. MOre school tomorrow, can't say I'm looking forawrd to it. I was going to bring my camera tomorrow, but it looks like it's going ot rain so I don't think I will now!

       Well I didn't have such an interesting day, infact I didn't really have anything interesting in my day. At all. I did quite a bit of work, doing everything I should have done over the last two weeks. I went for a swim, that's quite exciting, lots of water and stuff. So other than all that, everything is a bit alésage.

       No more days left, lol. Went to the Europa Centre today, have to say that although the journey was deadful and Ms Slark really irritated me, the centre was actually ok. Mainly because the people told me I speak good french. But it was okay. I booked a 2 week holiday to Austria to go skiing, and then Jackie and I are sharing a caravan tomorrow night, for 2 nights. What fun. I also bought some shampoo which cost me £18 (rip off!), and some coffee and cheese. Oh, and a hat. Jackie purchased the lovliest pink bag, have to say that it suited her so well! Ha ha. But the journey was awful. Hours of the tube (about 26 stops I think, on the smelly district line). Then it was raining, and the teachers didn't know whre we were going- they had to stop and ask for directions!! Then on the way back Ms Slark said we all had to  get off the train at East Croydon, even though the train we were on would have taken us straight home, and if we got off the train we'd just be getting striahgt back on it. But no, we have to get off. So after a lot of arguing I was quite cross. But then right at the last minute the 3 of us who wanted to get the East Grinstead train just announced that was what we were going to do and legged it before she could say much! But it would have been really stpuid otherwise, and probably ad ded about 30 minutes onto our journey. Bloody hopeless teachers. Anyway! What's everyone else been up to today?

       Good Good. I had a marvellous day, I really enjoyed it, and I was so chuffed that i didn't fall over! Okay, a few near misses, but at least I'm still in one piece (except for the blisters on my ankles!). I really enjoyed myself, haven't had a good bit of fun in a long time! It proibably won't be that lo ng before I go back, Nancy reckons I'm taking her next weekend, ha ha! No. Maybe later in the summer. Anyway, thanks to max for organising it, and thanks to everyone else for making it such an enjoyable day!  Tomorrow is the Europe centre, which will probably be as boring as hell. Providing that I can actually walk to get there, lol. But you don't know, miracles may happen! Anyway, see ya later guys, I'm off to get some beans on toast!

        I can do excitement! I can do excitement!   Well. Perhaps not. But at least I tried. But I am looking forward to ice-skating otmorrow! I've only ever been once before, so I'm begging people, please don't dessert me tomorrow!" I'll probably spend most of the day flat on my back, but hey! It's all fun really. I#'ve even bought a little disposable camera to capture everyone making prats of themselves, he he! Anyway! Nicki, that song is probably by Good Charlotte? If not, I'm guessing that's it's Drops of Jupiter, by Train? But it's probably the first one! lol. Anyway, busy day at work today, insane people wanteing to buy the most bizarro things meant I was up and down a ladder all day. Anyway, too knackered to talk and my fingers are all bleeding, I must go and bandage them up, till tomorrow peoples!

       Now that she's back in the atmosphere, With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, She acts like summer and walks like rain, Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey, Since the return from her stay on the moon, She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey. Tell me did you sail across the sun, Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded, And that heaven is overrated, Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star, One without a permanent scar, And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there.

       Well. Today i got up. Ate. Got dresssed. Rummaged through the bomb site (formerly known as my room) and tried to find my english book. Attempted the end half of and essay. Got bored because it was so dull and dreary. Gave up. Had a piece of toast for lunhc at 11am. Played midtown madness for 45 minutes. Walked to the village to go to work. Worked in shop for 4 and a half hours. Encountered some veyr strange people. Packed up. walked home. Played midtown madness until dinner. Tried to make CD work- it won't. Currently sitting here. Wondering what to do. It's rainging. Yuck. Might come back later. Might not.

       Very nice! Even though, for some bizarro reason, none of the pictures can be found by Yahoo. Stupid server. Anyway! Today I went to Croydon again wit my sisters, they were both bargain hutning. Nancy got a pair of those rave trousers (with the tassley bits and stuff all down them, strings and whot not, lol!) and they are blue, Louise bought a couple of tops I think? I really can't rememebr! We were in Alders hours and she tried on about 10 different things, but bought nothing! What a waste of time, lol. Seeings as I've got nothing planned now until Monday, revision starts tommorrow. Anyone who reads this blog regularly will notice that I've said that every day, but this time I really mean it :(  I'm off, see you later guys.

       I got bored so I did this:  We were supposed to leave the school on our double decker coach at 04.30PM.  urlLink Jack  urlLink ie  came up to say hi. I think  urlLink Darren  did, I'm not sure. Didn't leave until about 07.00PM. Why? Well the coach was late. Then they had to keep repacking the luggage bit because there wasn't enough room. Plus there was a big ol crack in the front of the upper section which they thought was dangerous. Because of the late start we missed about 3 ferrys to France. Eventually we got on one at about 10.30PM. While waiting to get booked on this ferry we had great fun at the front of the coach taking  urlLink pictures ! And generally being hyper. The coach trips there and back were probably the best bit of the trip!  urlLink Madness ! To get to our designated (love that word) hotel we had to pass through France,  urlLink Switzerland  and Italy. Long trip but fun. The hotel was cool, had to  urlLink get up  each morning at 7am! There were many o amusing moments throughout the week. In Verona  urlLink Jane  ate a Kinder egg. The toy was this Virgin Mary staute so we built it and put it at the front of the coach. About a minute later a nun crossed the road!!!!!  We even brought some football shirts and made our own  urlLink team ! If ever to go to Venice make sure you get a ride on the  urlLink gondalas . Take an art book! Do some  urlLink sketching ! Ever met  urlLink Peggy ? Of course we were  urlLink cream-crackered  on the way home. Maybe that was because were up  urlLink late .... But whenever you go on a group holiday, always take a  urlLink group photo .

       I saw Tom in Croydon! It was really scary, i was talking to my friend about e-mailing people and I was saying "I e-mail Tom alot cos he's always there", look up and who's walking towards us, but Tom? It was REALLY scary! Anyway. I bought a CD today but it's for Lisa's birthday so I shouldn't really post here what it is just in case someone accidently lets slip, lol! What else did I get? Oh yeah, a beanie baby Babboon as a late easter pressent for my sister, cos she was moaning abut me not getting her one, and it was cheap, lol. Cheap-skate me. Other than that I got a little book too! For all you lot to write it, ha ha!

              I bought this album today in Croydon. It's really good, tell you more when I've finished listening to it! Good film, Johnny English, kept a smile on my face for the whole time, very good. Atkinson as good as ever, I don't think I've seen him in a new film or movie for ages? I also bought a little book for all you guys to write in on the last day of term - getting excited now, year 11s almost over! Nothing going on much in my life really. This looks quite interesting, somebody is going to turn the whole Who Wants To Be A Millionaire thing with the cheater into a movie  urlLink Millionaire scam to become film  - should be interesting.

       Lol. Tom, did you know that Julz's oboe teacher is Pete Long's girlfriend/wife (can't remember which)? Pete Long being a member of Jool's Rhythm & Blues Orchestra? She is going to have a sneaky word with her and see what she can arrange, but nothing promised though, but wouldn't that be cool?!! I cannot wait! Seems like everyone has got Jools fever at the moment!  I can't wait for Bon Jovi either- that will probably be the best gig that I've ever been too, although we will probably get deafened!! Yahooooooo!  In the end I didn't see the 300th episode of the Simpsons last night, I went to bed and watched the film about Anne Frank, which was qutie interesting. I might try to read it again, I  think. I read a lot of it when I was in year 4, but it was a bit advanced for me then and I didn't really understand all of it, and eventually my teacher told me to give up and read something more normal (teachers for you, eh?!). But I might get it out the library and read it after the exams of something, seeings as I will probably have a lot of spare time on my hands! Anyway. I've just come back from clearing up the kitchen, I went down there annd there was dozens of bowls, plates and glasses on the side, so I opened the dishwasher and found it was full of dirty plates (or so i thought). So, I washed and dried up all this stuff, took me over half an hour to do, only for Nancy to walk in and say "What are you doing that for? The dishwasher is clean, y ou've just got to empty it" and I thought some very rude things then! i was also quite cross cos I'd squeezed a couple of plates, a glass and quite a bit of cutlery into the dishwasher, so I had to try and decide which was clean and which wasn't! Worst thing was, I was about to run the dishwasher cos I'd filled it up with the powder and eveyrhting, so I would have been re-washing most of it! Geez I am so thick sometimes! After all that I have decided not to do any revision this morning seeings as it is nearly lunch anyway, I will just mess around playing computer games, and after lunhc I will do some serious revision! (says she who has said that eveyr day yet done none properly yet). Anyway, toooodle-oooo guys.

       When I went to see Jools Holland in the Royal Albert Hall they where 45 minutes late, so the crowd decided to start a mexican wave. The only problem is the Royal Albert Hall has circular seating going to whole way round the building so the wave didn't stop until the music started, just kept going on, and on, and on. The best bit was when a group of people tried to start another one going in the other direction, it lasted for a little while until the two met and it fell apart a bit.

       Yeah thanks jackie, I went to look it up in my gran's tv book! But, I haven't seen that one with Apu and the Squishee Lady before!! Saucy!!  Nicki, sounds like you had a whail of a time! My job is at a little DIY come homecare shop in Warlingham, I have been there for three weeks now and I'm enjoying it! Anywya, can't really type veyr well cos I've just burnt my middle finger on the sandwich toaster and it's gone all funny already, I will probably end up with a blister which is not going to be fun on the pad of my finger! Anyway, I really ought to do some revision today, so I'd better go before the Simpsons at 9.30! Bye guys

       Just got back from a few days up in Manchester. I went with mother to see Ronan Keating at the MEN Arena. It holds 18,000 and looks small but you don't realise at first that there is a second tier up above you! It was a good laugh. The stewards were trying to get a Mexican wave going, eventually they did and it was so fun. The concert itself was better than at Wembley. Maybe it was because he had some more dates under his belt I'm not sure. Maybe it was because there were more people? And that the audience was younger? But it was good. Veyr good atmosphere, everyone was up for it and jumping about. When he came on at the back of teh arena for the encore 'Pump It Up' and the whole audeinece was clapping and stuff I could just picture this track being shown somewhere like the Hard Rock Cafe. What is your job Jo? Max please blog. That is a request. A couple more and sposh, you'll be gone.

       lol, it was quite funny. Dad kepy piping in about burying giblets under the patio, for some reason. Nancy was throwing up in the lounge cos she is really ill, she has been up since 3am crying, she is so hot you could fry eggs on her, and she has been sick numerous times. Also she is being very "mummyfied" today, and won't be in a room without mum, so when we were eating lunch she was sprawled on the sofa. Which wasn't a good idea, seeings as she could see and smell the food.

       Really? Cool. I've just had my yummy lunch! Roast Turkey with bread sauce and lots of roastie potatoes, carrots, butternut squash, and gravy! And to finish it off yummy mini eggs! we had a really weird discussion though, we were tlaking about digging the patio up, and thne mum started saying she doesn't know why people bother to bury bodies under the patio cos it's so much work, then we started talking about how you do it etc etc. Then it emerged that Louise had gone to get a cloth out the sink, but she reached into the sink and grabbed the turkey giblets! OOooh it was funny! All this while poor Nancy is throwing up in the lounge. Marvellous, I love Easter.

       It is next Monday he comes home, or perhaps even Tuesday. I'm not sure, but I am quite positive it is one of those two days! Brad Pitt's bottom sounds like a very good piece of artwork, anyone fancy a trip to Madame Tussauds sometime soon........................??! Anyway! I've been at work all day and my knees and feet are killing me, but I really enjoy it cos it is so interesting and I'm active all day! Beats sitting on my butt watching the tv or whatever! Anyway, she has decided she needs some extra help next week, so I'm working Friday as well as Saturday, and possibly even Wednesday and Thursday! So extra money coming my way this week, lol! Its quite nice though cos Tina (who works there) likes to gossip, and sometimes when its quite we just chat about stuff! She's always asking my what I'm doing tonight (as in Saturday night) and it's quite sad cos I always have to say "staying home and watching tv"!!! At least at the mo I have the excuse that I'm too busy revising for my exams, lol. But she was quite interested to hear about the BonJovi concert that I've got lined up! Weather is horrible today, it's been threatening to rain all day, and even when it wasn't drizzling it was soooo windy! half the pots outside the shop decided to blow away, so one of my duties today was chading them all down the road! One of the wheelie bins also decided to go for a roll which was quite annoying, it wouldn;'t stay still! In the end I tied it to one of the metal bins. I really shoudl shut up now because you lot probably really don't want to hear about my dustbins and whotnot but hey! My faminly aren't in a listening mood cos they've been digging up the patio all day and are now comatosed on the sofa, so I thought I'd come and blog to get everything out of my system! That's the problem with not talking for a lot of the day- you have to let it all out eventually! Anyway, I really will leave you in peace now, have fun tomorrow guys and don't eat too much chocolate! We've got a novel new experiment going on in our house- no chocolate of any sort for easter. Whoppee. But I guess I'll be thankful in the long run! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

       It's either this Sunday or next Sunday. Just catching up on the news and I have found that Madame Tussaud's waxworks are not made of wax! Only the head and hands are, the rest is fibre glass. Only one exception which is brand new this week, Brad Pitt's bottom, which is made from a foam and silicon mixture to make it squeezably lifelike.

       Well so far this holiday i have not revised one iota ! Really i need some little person at my side to come up to me and go : Rivise you little scoundle u, or i will rip your head off and flush it down the loo! I think that way i would sit down and do some revision. But my problem is i find it so god damn boring! Id rather sit outside and burn my eyes out than revise !  The reason i dont come on during the day is because it costs a bomb if you dont have broadband, which idont have so therefore it means i cant come on during the day. I have only just realside that because it is a bank holiday today i could have come on earlier because it is cheap! But neva mind at least i am on half an hour earlier than usual.  I went down the park today with a couple of friends but it woz sooooooooo boring that we ended up coming back early ( i mean like we were down the park for less than an hour ) That dobbins hill really does your legs in even if you are used to going up it ! I think in toal i stopped like 20 times because i got knackered after going up like 3 steps. Nicki isnt coming on here today or tonight because she is up in Manchester i think and is seeing another Ronan concert with her mutter. Tom is on holiday in the Lake districk (I think) with Andy Pandy. Max is with his lovely girlfriend Nic at this moment in time so is probably too busy to deal with blogging! LOL ( they make a really good couple ) I have nothing else planned for the holidays although i want to go and see Jhonny English, hopefully dat will happen and i also have that Europa trip to look forward to on the extra day we have off. Oh what joys, I am begining to think it was a bad idea becuase you dont get to choose who you go with in a group, you just get shoved in a group as you go through "Customs". Which means i could end up with David Andrews or even Joanna. Ahhhhhhhh. Only kidding Jo ! I am dreading the french speaking cause i cant even understand what the teacher goes on about in english let alone what she is saying in french ! But hopefully i will get half decent grades in the other bits to give me a decent grade overall. You must be bored by reading this by now so i will leave you to blog for yourself or to ignore everything i have just writen ! hehe bye

       Where is everybody?!!! Is everybody revising? But surely you can't revise all day, everyday, and every night? Get a life peeps! Okay, I admit, I have been nrevising a lot, but I am still fiding time to pop in here and blog, to let whoever bothers to read the blog know what's going on in our little world!  Well, today it is still sunny but there is quite a strong wind, therefore it is nowhere near as hot as yesterday. However, sitting in a south-facing room with all the w indows shut, I am sweltering. Mother and Father are destroying the patio (it has one end missing now and a big hole in the middle) with sledge hammers, apparently it has sunk and they need to re-set it? Well, I haven't a clue what they're doing but they've just discovered it is built on mud (ha ha, yet another botch job from the builders!), and dad has got all of next week off to do it. Except he is going to a motorbike show on Monday. Louise is lying in the hammock (very suave) wearing a suntop, sunglasses and a towwl (not quite sure what happened to the rest of her clothes), and reading Harry Potter 4. Nancy is at the bottom of the garden wearing a pair of polythene gloves (??) And playing with a friend's guinea pigs that we are looking after while they are away in the Peak District. I suppose I sholudb't complain that they're down the garden, earlier Louise marched in and demanded that I held one of the pigs whilst she made a cup of tea. Animals are fair enough, but when you have to hold them for long periiods of time you begin to wonder how strong their bladders are. But I guess guinea pigs' bladders are stronger than my little cousin Matthew's (aged 2 1/2, visited yesterday), as sometime yesterday afternoon he managed to wee down Louise's top. That's a bit worrying, cos I've just realised that Louise is wearing the top again today and there was no wash load done last night..................... At the moment I'm in the middle of writing out ALL my geography case studies onto little cue cards, so I can play snap like games! Yay! I have done 3 out of 6 of my French aural topics, so I'm gradually getting there, I just need to go through them all and get mother to tell me how to pronounce half the words, lol! When I've finished the geography case studies I think I will go on and do some more on the Cold War, as I need to brush up on the space race and the arms race. It's always the things that you haven't revised properly that come up on the damned exams, so I'm gonna try and make sure i know everyhting inside-ou by the time we get to the exams! I have a month till the first exam (Music and RE on the first day), and then another week before any more exams (thank god for half terms!!). So really I'm stressing about things that aren't really gonna be that big a problem (I sincerely hope!). I just need a bit more sself-discipline, so I can work for 2 hours instead of giving up after and hour and then playing 30 minutes on this fab game called 'Super Bounce Out'. Oh the joys. Please blog guys (do I sound like Nicki?!!!) cos I am as bored as hell, haven't spoke to any of my friends for ages, and I'll go insane if there's nothign to do apart from play with various virtual multi-coloured rubber bouncy balls. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee guys.

       Well, I'm here, well for the moment anyway. Yes i have been sunning myself although it woz a bit to windy to do it today. I have been to the cinema with Nicki today to see: Blue Crush. It was actually better than expected, i thought it was gonna be a really boring film but it wasnt ! I have already got myself a tan, but i can always improve it and it will be better if i have a tan b4 i go to majorca cause that way i will come back looking fine! (hopefully with some boys numbers) Hehe In fact i cant wait for my holiday, which is not that long away now ! Woooohooooo But first i have the boring task of revising for my GCSE's and then the task of actually doing them. eek well enough of my boring chit chat ill be off now to leave u in some peace.

       Me again. It's 11am and I've done 30 m,inutes revision on teh Cold War, it's suprising how much I can remember, having already revised it thoroughly twise (for yr 10 exmas and mocks) so I don't actually have veyr much to worry about it! On to Germany next I thinks! Anyway, weather is beautiful again, but I am hiding in my room all day today because my aunt is coming (which is always a complicated procedure). She always phones up and invites her and her 2 boys (both under 5) round, they make a fowl mess, she talks absolute rubbish, mum doesn't like her, and they never leave (plus they always arrive at least an hour early, and frequently phone up at 8,30 when we're all still aslepp). Fun. Mum has told her today that I'm revising all day (I really don't feel like seeing them), therefore I'm staying in my room all day, I don't think I'll even venture down for lunch! Much safer to stay up here when she's around. So, back to history I guess, thought I'd just pop in here for a bit while I give my eyes a break! Acutlaly, beeter go and get some drink supplies if I'm hibernating all day. Later peeeeeps.

       IYo peeps. I have been having such a busy week I haven't had much time for revision yet, alrthough I have done bits and bobs that I needed to sort! Proper revision starts tomorrow though, when my sis has no more hordes of friends round (thank god!). But, at least we have glorious weather! Mum and I sat out in the garden this afternoon, we are both as white as sheets so we have decivede that we needed to tan! Unfortunatley I'm still as white as when I started, but hey, I'mm looking after my skin and I 'm not gonna look 40 when I'm 20 (me hopes!!). Anyway, gotta go, people to go, places to see.......bye!

       I'm here. Have been here all weekend, apart from yesterday when I was working from 9 till 5, and when I got home I was knackered so I ate dinner and then watched Harry Potter that someone had bought yesterday. Today my uncle came round as it was Lou's birthday, and among all the nice pressies she got 2 dance mats and the Ps game, so we have been on that all afternoon, and I mean since about 2.30! It's now 5 and I've only just given uip, ha ha! Tomorrow I'm going to France for the day with a firned so I probably own't blog as I will be back late, and when I do get back I will try and fit some revision in! That is what I'm going to do now- revision. After a second helping of that triple-chocolate-truffle-900calories a slice-Thornton's-cake..........................

       Ah yes! I was wondering where Tom was, and I've just remembered that he has gone to Thorpe Park too, so I'm all alone, :( No worries though, I've had a lazy morning! Got up about 9.45 having been woken up by Nancy shouting "Bye Jo!" about 3 million times before she went out to school, and got woken up by Louise charging around like a looney in order to get a 7.50am train- crAzy!!! So, I got up, leisurely got dressed, did some washing (aren't I helpful?), read a magazine, had a veyr long phone call to my friend Sarah, ate lunch, now I'm here! What fun. It's flippin' cold outside, hope you guys haven't frozen to death yet, cos that wouldn't be very good.  I've got everyhting sorted out for the ball now, and I'm sooooooooooo excited! My hair is gonna be so cool (even if I say so myself!), and I think I'm gonna look quite different, he he! I'm also going to pick up my dress this afternoon, so everthing will be perfect! Yay! My friend had her ball last night (Riddlesdown) and she said the limo was fab, they were all hanging out the windows and waving at anyone possible, so that's something we've gotta try guys! I think it's gonna be brilliant! Who si eveyrone having their photos taken with? Or are you lot having them done on your own? Sarah said they managed to get about 7 people in theirs, I'm looking forward to seeing it to see what it turns out like, ha ha! Generally she had a fab time, but I think ours is gonna be HUGE! Really posh place, nice food, good music, all our friends, having one heck of a time!  Right, I reallly shoiuld go and do some work now. I'm going to start by copying up Nicki's history, so I can either post it through her door tonight, or it will perhaps be Sunday? I don't know, gimmie a yell if you need it before then Nicki! Tooooooooodle pip guys. Don't really know why I'm saying that, seeings as none of you are here, but hey. Tooooooooooooodles pips.

I am really excited now except for the prospect of getting up at 7:00Am tmor ! I am going to be wiped out by the end of the day ! anyway ill be off now i may as well start getting my stuff ready, that way i will have more time to do stuff in the morning ! HeHe see ya all tmor !

       My nose hurts. And I have just discovered I have an infection in my eaar (as in actually inside my ear lobe)- it was really hurting so I was rubbing it, and discovered this big lump inside my ear lobe. Mother says it is not normal, and I htink it is because I am allergic to alot of my earings. I have just thrown most of my earings in the bin. But how my ear hurts- Nicki I totally sympathesise with you.

       I was in a good mood earlier anyways because  1) I'm going to Thorpe Park  2) American forces are in Baghdad and Brittish have now taken Basra. Its great!!! Now I'm not because of the dumbass lot round the other conrer who decided to push down our human pyramid. You have no idea how much my head hurts now. I really hate Marc, JFK and Flandrews right now and I will gold this as a long term grudge.

Even the set 5's of our year know that the summer exam is going ot be on everyhting we've done this year! Geeeez, he irritated me today. We've been doign forces to death when we coudl have been revising more useful things, like the stuff no-one gets in waves and radiation. Flippin' heck, dudes.

       I had to escape, the city was sticky and cruel. Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you. I was dreaming while I drove, the long straight ahead. To taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night, to get to you. is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep, to make love to you. Is that all right? I drove all night.  What in this world keeps us from tearing apart? No matter where I go I hear the beating of your heart. I think about you when the night is cold and dark. No-one can move me the way that you do, nothing erases this feeling between me and you.  I drove all night, to get to you, is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep, to make love to you. I drove all night, is that all right? I drove all night.  To taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night, to get to you. Is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room, woke you from your sleep to make love to you.  I drove all night. To taste your sweet kisses you arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night.   Honey love love, ooh it'd ease my mind. I need to find time, someone to call mine. My mamma said you can't hurry  love, no you';ll just have to wait. She said 'love don't come easy, its a game of give-and-take'.  urgh this one is way too fast for me. Never mind.

Helen was with me because he needed to give her a birthday present. I got to pick em up and stuff. Holly is lovely, she is so sweet. She kept coming in now an dthen tocheck on them and when they started whining she came in. Bless. You can see their personalities already, the lazy one, the attention seeker, the bully...lol. I'm feeling really down though at the moment. Everything is just so, pants.  I have found that every year my hayfever is different.

       What do you do if you think a friend needs help? Like serious help, not just that she's struggling at school or something. What do you do? What if this friend pushes away all the time, won't let anyone in? What if she won't speak to you, won't tell you anything, yet you thought you were her trusted best friend, just as you trusted her? What if she's changed so much you just don't know who she is, you don't understand her? But what do you do if you think this could turn out very badly for her? As in she might do something very stupid, but you can't talk to her, nor her family about it?   What do you do??????

       Well, what an interesting day. At least it is hot now, and I've been doing maths and history i the garden all day, now I am a bit roasty, but hey! Our phone line is dead, no-one can call us, and when pick up the phone you just hear nothing, not even the dialing tone. And it would be on a day that I need to call loads of people to sort stuff out! Plus my phone battery just died. And I discovered I only had 3p credit so I had to go out and buy some more. The umbrella shading me from the scorching sun in the garden keeps falling over. And then to top it all, a bird flies over and craps on my history book. Oh the jiys of living in the Great British countryside.  Hope whoever went to the cinema had fun, that film sounded good at first but then the trailers looked a bit silly, and hope people who went to the fair didn't get too burnt, and didn't spend all their hard-earned money!!

       Aww, poor Jackie. Sometimes it does that to me when I am on msn, if teh connect cuts out for a second you are signed out and I never realise so I start to wonder why no one is talking and they realise I have been offline for about ten minutes. Which can be crucial. I didn't know Tom was leaving and this may be late to Tom but: Have a good time! I was forced into science revision earlier. I have done all the enviroment topic now. Bet I won't remember it but I tried. I can't handle the history. Its way too hard. I may go and find Mr Weston after half term to ask for any revision tips for history. I am drinking the most disgusting drink. Lilt. Yuk! I am only drinking it because its fizzy. I am meeting up with Pennie tomorrow to do our Sk8er Boi stalking and then to buy a new top for Friday. It should be a laugh.

       lol okay bey bye Jackie! I htink Tom has gone to Greece sailing, although I ahd totally forgotten that he was going on holiday, i had just heard him mentioning it! But I think that must be where he has gone. Um, nice weather today, sat in the garden and did some revision for about 3 hours, the most I've done yet!! Weather was nice but now it's come over a bit cloudy, hence me being on the PC now! Got to go and pick Nancy up from Guide camp later, so the peace in our house will be broken! aww!  I'm off cos I'm eternally bored. Bye bye!

       Oh Bollox, just great. I write a nice long blog press post and publish and then reaslise that my connection to the internet had stopped and i have lost everything i wrote in there. FUCK ( scuse the language) Well Tom has gone to a hot country, but unfortuantly i cant remeber which one. I actually asked tom to write where he was going and what he woz gonna do but he obviousoly couldnt be bothered. Well i went to my cousins yesterday, they live in Oxted and have a mahoosive house and garden. I love it. Btw Jo one of my cousins is gonna be in the upper 6th at Oxted. Jo i will wear themed clothing if that is what you wish foir, although that will mean i will need to  go on another shopping trip into Croydon.... Thats not a bad thing though :) Have any of you been invited to a party at Goff's house on the Saturday? ( day after Helen and Pennies) I have been invited but i dont want to go if no one is gonna go ! Oh yea, i still cant work out how you get pictures on here, its too confusing Well that is it from me - The wisdom woman, farwell and goodbye

And half the people who I thought were my friends have either refused to dress up to my party, or are putting me second by saying, oh btw I'm only coming an hour before the end cos I can't be assed to turn up for the whole time. Great. Thanks a bunch, 'friends'. I am really pissed off righ tnow.

       Admit what? Did Nicki fancy your friend Jackie? Is that what all the strange italics is about? Anywya, Jo's party was brill last night, it was a proper house party (ie parents cleared out and we had the run of the downstairs etc and the garden), and all in all it was a good laugh! Today I went to work and i've been on my feet all day, they are aching sooooo much! There is sod all on the tv tonight apart from the Euroviaion thing that I WON'T  be watching, especailly as those gay Russian girls are singing. And of course dad is so busy cementing the patio he can't go out to blockbusters, so it looks like I'm going to be reduced to doing some revision tonight. How marvellous. Anyway, cya later guys

       German reading yesterday. They spent about half an hour faffing about. Idiots. But no more German! Ever!!!!!! I wnet to see The Matrix Reloaded with Jackie as she said. Yes it was nice seeing  a boy from my primary school that i havent seen for 5 years ! It was nice seeing him after all that time.  Hehe. Mwahahaha. I loved the film. I don't think it was better or worse than the first. I think its partly because of the way the directors designed the triolgy. As with most trilogys the first film like X-men introduces you to the characters and the story. In this case its helping us to understand the Matrix. Now the 2nd and 3rd films will be jam packed of action as we see neo work out he reasons why he is The One. Btw, Neo is an agagram for one. Hehe.

It was nice seeing him after all that time. The film was great, lots of action and suspence, although i do believe that the first film was better as it woz more interesting. Now all i have to do is wait until The Matrix Revolutions comes out in Novemeber. Well for those of you that went to Jo. C birthday party, did you have fun? or woz andy's party better? Big Brother has finally arrived, YAY. I already hate one of the housemates called anouska, she is so annoying and loud, she is up for eviction so that is good.

       Yeha, I though that was quite okay actually, easier than the praactice exams that we were given!! I thought the ROll of Thunder question was a bit tricky tho, asking all this nonse about how much has Cassie learnt of the right and wrong wasy to live? Ridiculous. Anyway, I thought it was okay. I never bother to plan cos it just wastes my time, and I never pay any attention to the plans anyway, so from my experience it;s more worthwhile for me just to start writing, and worry about what I do next when I do actually get stuck, which thankfully dind't happen. But I guess everyone is different! I suddenyl think iof random things to write.  So, History revision class tomrrow, I hope you're going Nicki otherwise I'll be lonely! Then a week off- bliss!  CAn't wait, havent' got all tht much planned though because I want to do a lot of revision.

       Oh yea baby! I kicked ass on that exam!!!!!!!! Eng Lit is the only exam I ever look forward to you know because I never find them incredibly hard like maths or science. The only problem I had in that exam was that I kep forgetting to start a spiderdiagram or a list of things to include in the essay so each time I wrote the introduction THEN did a small list above that. I think it will be okay though. That lepricorn teacher and another English teacher are so rude! They stood right by my table chatting away, flapping pieces of paper right by my ear while I was trying to work. How rude! They could have distracted me (which they did) and damaged my chances of a good grade! Then the lepricorn put her cup of coffee ON MY DESK. HOW OUTRAGEOUS!!!!! I had a good mind to knock it off 'by accident' but couldn't be bothered. Too much effort really. Good luck everyone! I hope you did well!

       Yes! never ever have to sit through another music lesson ever, anything I do to do with music will be strictly voluntary from now on! And to celebrate, Tom and I have had simulatneous book burnings! I burnt my book which wasn't entierly successful, firstly it wouldn't light, and when it finally caught light some dead leaves caught alight too, and set fire to the fence!! OOPS! when I'd finished, I cam back up and found a folder full of notes and songs from choir, which of course I had to burn too! This was a little more successful, I went down behind the wall at the bottom and created a nice little bonfire, whihc burnt very well for about half an hour until it started to rain. But all my music is now reduced to ashes, which actually feels like a great relief. Ok, so it's vandalism. Ok it ruins the atmosphere. And ok, a few flowers got singed. But hey,. it'ss a weight off myh mind!

         o_O Another fancier of the old.  Good for you I guess.  Charles is seen as a fatherly-type of person, and is one you can open up to.  He is known to be amiable and very dependable.  His genius is only surpassed by his love and understanding of other people.  He makes for a great companion with much affection, plus, the baldness *is* kinda sexy.    urlLink   Who Is Your Ideal X-Men 2 Mate?

       Morning. I hope Jackie's PE goes wall today! And anyone else who has an exam!    Your ideal mate is Bobby Drake.  With his innocent sweetness and his boyish good looks, how can any girl go wrong?  He's the type of guy to supply you with all the TLC that you can handle, and he'll always be there for you when you need moral support, or just a shoulder to cry on.  Though he is still young, he lacks the experiences of life, and can be naive.    urlLink   Who Is Your Ideal X-Men 2 Mate? (ladies only)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Well, i had my french oral today, it woz well hard and i hated every god damn minute of it. I think i did okay though, probably got half marks? I got health and Eduaction, i would say they were the best 2, cause environment is well hard and so is youth culture ans future plans. Well my next exam is PE so i really have to revise a lot for that, i want to get an A and i know that i can get it if i try really hard. I would say it is my best subject so fingers crossed. Does anyone want to come Job hunting with me? I want to go into croydon some time next week and have a look. Well thats it from me.

       well wht lovelly weather today. I got up about 9am this morning and pottered around for 3 hours, then decided to clear out my room, seeings as I have a huuuge amount of junk stashed away.I started with under my bed, where I foudn a ridiculour number of plastic carrier bags and loads of old chritsmas cards, then I moved onto my desk which contained thousands of unwanted, unloved, unused pens, which promptly went in the bin. NOw if you come into my room you can see the carpet, and it is possible to find what you want in my desk, which is quite an achievement. I also got round to changing the sheets and vacumink all the dust of the paintwork, and then I did an hour's revision before lunch and Neighbours! Since then I have been reivising/chatting on messenger, cos the weather is so foul I can't really be bothered to do anything properly at the moment. I've got to go out before 4pm to be at school for our first Austria rehersal, which I am so not looking forward to. If I get stuck in the front row I will scream, I really will! Also, Mrs Hicks reckons we need a bass guitar for a couple fo songs, so I dread to think what she's got in store for us, probably a shed load of stupid gospel songs that require singing stupid words and waving our arms around like loonies, cos that's what we usually end up doing. Only this year we've got Mrs Kent too, who altough she is nicer than Mrs Hicks, she picks out the most ridiculous songs for her choirs to sing.  Oh well, the joys of music. Even though my street cred is going ot be ruined after this, at least I'm leaving you lot here!  Must go finished some revision before I have to go and suffer torture, toodle pip guys!

       OOOH, also they do it so the first 2 people get the first set of topics, then the second 2 people get the second set of topics, and so on. So if you're clever enough (but it's a bit c onfusing) you could work out what you may have! But that is a bit too confusing!

       Well thank God the aurals are over and done with! I think mine went quite well, or at least Madame Slark was grinning the whole way through, lol! Jackie, in case you wanted to know, the topics that go together are: Self and Family + Environment Health + Education Youth Culture + Future Plans Anyway, for the rest of the morning Tom, Doe, Alex and I sat on the grass and had a laugh at Mr Weston who seemed quite embarrased that we all knew about the poster- nice one Nicki! Alex then walked home, and we went to my house via the chip shop, and had chip butties! I can't believe that Tom and Doe hasve never had chip butties! They weren't the best I've ever had cos really you need thicker bread, more butter and hotter chips, lol! But next time, we have to have fish finger sandwiches, they are just the best!! Bananas are ucky in sandwiche tho! Anyway I've got to do some revision tonight seeings as I've been out all day, lol! See y'all later guys (hope your art is going ok Nicki!!)

       That was amusing. While talking to Pete last night he said Mr gallagher saw it, looked suprised but thinks he took it down. My sister said Seaward left the one on his door up and I think Mr Weston found his one amusing. It was fun while it lasted. I got an email from Mr Bennett because I sent him some of the ball pics as he wasn't there. He wante dto know what Helen was doing in one of the pictures and I quote him when he says: "what is helen doing with her face in the limo?". I couldn't stop laughing at that. Anywho, yes. Got up about 20 mins ago. I have German second lesson then I'll be over to collect Jackie for lunch and revision. I have already have 2 texts from Doe and a phonecall from Jenny which didn't get far because her battery ran out. Brilliant. See you all later!

       Lol, today was fun, French for me was a waste of time, i thought we were gonna go through the oral topic so i was kinda annoyed at that. Nicki put the photos of the scicen lot drunk up round the school but within bout half an hour most of them had been taken down ! :( I dont think they like them much although Mr Moore did. Well after the french i went back to Nicki's house and we have now organised a revision session tmor in Croydon library, I cant beleuve im doing it but there ya go ! Hehe. Well nothing much more to say. I'm off

       ok Well I finally got my necklace back (he he!) after Jackie forgot, so I went to science revision and Jackie went home to get it for me. I went to french second lesson which was actually quite handy, and then I went to see Miss Bashir with Scott and ssarah which was VERY helpful! She's set up a few more dates when we can go in adn see her to go through loads of stuff. Which is useful. Tomorrow I'm doing some more revision (wow!) and going in at 2.30 to see Miss Bashir. Then more work on my french aural, and then mum and I are going to spend the whole day on Wednesday going through them all so I'm fully prepared for Thursday, cos I'm soo nervous about it!  Other than that the day has been really boring, cos I've been revising all day! Not much to say really, so I'm going to go now! Bye

       Yeh he he he he! I had so much fun last night, boogeying and mingling and socialising!  It was absoulately fab, far better than I thought it was going to be! The teachers were hilarious though, all smoking like chimneys and half of them turning up pissed or stoned! What a bad example to set! Anyway, I thorogulsy enjoyed myself and I will remember that night forever, I really will. It was absoultely brilliant, even down to the last details like Mrs Kent beeping at us on the motoway cos we were all waving out the windows like looneys, oh and of course Oliver winning Best Smile, he was in his element last night! I really thoroughly enjoyed myself, thank you all for making it so special for me! I got to go guys, my hair is still a mess, see you at Andy's!

       I think it was nice of him to write that because he was putting something personal about you rather than a simple 'good luck' like some teachers. Like in mine he wrote something thast really only I would understand properly. Madness. Well ya'll know about my wrist problemo yah? Well I got my mom to look at it (she used to be a nurse) and its def swollen so its def worse that it was! Nooooooooooooooooo! Oh yea, Tom you havn't finished writing in my boooooooooooooooooooook!

So Nikko, see me tomorrow and you'd better get writing! Anyway, in maths today I think Mr Blincoe was trying to suggest that we devise a method of cheating in the maths exam cos he said we need to have a signal to show what is wrong. OH dear, I really hope he wasn't serious, but he sounded as if he was. RE was ok cos we wacthed 'My Big fat Greek Wedding' which is such a funny film! None of my class seemed to get the jokes tho, I htink it was a bit wasted on them! I'm not writin gmuch cos I'm so excited about tomorrow and FRIDAY! I'm gonna just be a ball of e xcitement! If you can be that! But hey! Got to go cos I think Neighbours might be starting soon, bye!

       P.S: If I'm totally insane tomorrow, it's because Louise has spent all morning downloading tracks on the net and burning them onto a CD. It wouldn't be so mad if these songs were decent, but they happen to all be by Alvin and the Chipmunks, and range from things such as 'Play that Funky Music' to 'Macarana' and 'Time Warp'. They are truly dreadful, and to make it worse they're sung by cabbage chipmunks.

       Awww! Very amusing. I didn't do that IQ thing either, I didn't know it was on. I can't actually remember what I did last night. OHyeah I can, I was revising with mother, which was actually helpful. Today I got up about 9.30, ate a leisurley breakfast (cos everyone was alrady up and in the garden), oitered around my room listening to music and chilling, and finally got dresed aboyut 11am. I then did 2 hours on maths before lunch. After lumnch I lay in the hammock in the sun for an hour, then I got attacked by Nancy cos apparently I was a pirate and I might attack the ship she was sailing round the garden. So I grabbed a plastic sword and started fighting back, and it ended with her walking the plank. I then took over the sh ip, but got bored after a while a decided to jump up and down on the exercie trampoline. Then my legs got wobbly so I gave up, went back inside and did some more music appreciation, ha ha. Then I went out for a biyccycle ride with my down all across these fields and stuff, and I can tell you, boy does my back-side hurt. But anyway! I'm going to do some history revision later, and I'm going to do some more science with mother tonight. Toodles pip for now guys (seeings as MSN isn't working), and see you all tomorrow!

       Well I stayed in bed for about half an hour and then my dad convinced me to help him in the garden. Lawn mower doesn't work. So lets go inside and see if I can get the computer to work. Oooo, I know what the problem is, why don't I just move the hard drive into the other computer and then look at it? Good idea, I thought. So I did. Then it caught alight and smoke started to rise out of the computer. Back to the drawing table. Bloody cabages, should have stayed in bed.

       Very good. Unfortunatly I can't do these tests without getting a false mark, so I won't bother. For the following paragraph, replace the word 'cabage' with something that ryhmes with "ducking" and starts with "f". A terrible day. Tried to dig a cabage hole for a cabage plant in the cabage garden, but some cabage idiot built the cabage garden on cabage clay so I can only go about cabage 10cm. Another one of my cabage computers has decided that computer-cabage-life isn't just worth cabage living and is now sulking in the corner of the room not doing anything. I have a cabage head-ache and I can't cabage think straight. It's half past cabage eleven and I'm going to cabage bed.

       Jackie, seeings as I have only just got onto Blogger I will still answer your question! We went into Croydon this morning because you wanted a necklace and a hair accessory for Friday's Leavers Ball. We looked in every shop possible (lol!) and in the end you bought a clear clippy thing that you can put in your hair in about 6 differernt ways for an 'up-do'. Let me know how it goes and how you're going to have you hair! You didn't buy a necklace though. Tom bought some stuff in Next and something in Smiths that completely escapes my mind, and then he bought Die Another DAy in HMV, where he also paid for my Harry Potter CD because he had a voucher to use (but there is money sitting here next to me waiting to be given to him on Tuesday morning!). Then we went home because I had a rehersal to get to, and by the time I had got home I had 10 minutes to eat lunch before I had to go out again! I then went to a rehersal for my concert next week, and I think it's going to be a really good one, even if I say so myself. Imagine 6 clarinets all playing melodiouys and spectacular tunes, and that's what you;'ll get next Sunday! One boy is totally hopeless though, I think he's gonna be kicked out and replaced, lol!!!  Anyway, I have just done a make-up trial for the ball and have decided against weird and wonderful makeup, I'm just gonna go with natural colours on!! Nothing blue or purple, I'm gonna look normal. ANyway, my hair is gonna be quite, um, different, so I don't wanna over do it. Other than that, I'm all sorted now! yay! I'm so excited about it!  I'm going to do some revisoin this evening, and apparently we're going out for a family day tomorrow. Yippe. ACtually, we haven't been out anywhere for ages, so it should be good. Better go, I think I have to go and cook a vegetable curry!

       Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Well today I went to work again. Interesting day in all, encoutered the Warlingham May Queen, a very sexist man, and an old lady who links singing and bendy toilet brushes. Other than that the day was pretty routine, and I get to learn how to use the till next Saturday! How fun!! Sounds sad, but it all looks quite fun really, swiping credit cards and stuff!  Um. Other than that, I was awake half the night last night because I kept having dreams about the ball, and I was so excited about leaving I hardly slept a wink! Hope I get some more sleep before Friday, otherwise I won't make it to the ball! Anyway, we're having a ridiculoursly early dinner otnight cos Nancy has friends round, so better go! Byeeeeee. BTW, see you 10,.30 tomorrow morning Jackie!

       I may pop over to see you but I need someone to go with me. Jackie?? Any takers?    This Is Your Song   Live your life to the fall With a lifetime of smiles Made us know right from wrong Always knowing a lie  You made us to be tough But never too rough Rise above what you said Never easily lead.  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song I wrote it for you It won't take all day just a minute or two  You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song  So I'll try and go on Loving all that we know Through the hardest of times you put on a show  You made us stand tall When all around us would fall Even when you were alone You believed you could fly  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song I wrote it for you It won't take all day Just a minute or two  You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song We wrote it for you It'll take all our lives Just to help us get through You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song.

       Well if you want somebody to come I am around on that Sunday - chat to me on MSN. We are leaving school! Finished required education! The fact most of us have 2 years of 6th form followed by 3 or 4 at Uni doesn't really matter, but you get the idea! Hehe. I'm actually nervous, and I know I ain't the only one! I've changed my book writing thing slightly, I'm going to buy a book with lined pages for peeps to write messages in and I'm going to use a blank book for signitures from random people and staff, plus I want people to draw a picture of themselves - just something slightly different from the normal thing. I have the photos from the skating, however I didn't use a fast enough film because the shop didn't have it, so unfortunatly they came out really dull, which I am quite annoyed about, but I have got some much faster film now - just got to try again! Jackie was talking about another Thorpe Park trip in July sometime? I can't remember the date, but what do we think? Anyway, I need my beauty sleep, about a decades worth, g'night.

        Well. HEre I am, at last! What a disguisting day. Raining, all day long. There was a brief period of glorious sunshine at about 4pm this afternoon, but since about 5pm it's been simply horrible! Dioesn't crap weather just make you feel awful? I really hope it doesn't do this next Friday, cos a) we're gonna get our outfits soaked, and b) my hair'll get ruined!! But hey! I've got the camera sorted now, mum says I can borrow hers cos it's easy to load and stuff, and she's got me a couple of spare films for lots of snapping away! They're gonna be my last memories of Warlingham, so they'd better be good ones, he he! I am so excited about next week, I can't wait! eveyrone I know has to write in my book, plus put their phone numbers and addresses and stuff! And I'm gonna get some of my faveourite teachers to write in there too, ha ha! So nothing too rude in their guys! And of course camera is coming in every day, to be put to good use! THink I should have a couple of good piccies from today at lunch, all of us girlies!  Anyway, tomorrow I am going to work, again! Then I will probably try a bit of revision in the evening. Sunday I;'m revising and then I've got a rehersal for a concert that I'm playing in next Sunday. Does anyone want to come? I know you probably all don't, but just in case you want to find out what I work my guts out for all the time, you can come along to All Saint's Church in Sanderstead at 3pm, Sunday 11th May to watch me play 1st in a sextet that I'm playing. But none of you lot will proably wanna come, but hey. LAst ever chance to see JoJo in a concert, ha ha! Other than that, not much, sounds sad but I'm really lookng forward to getting back on Tuesday so I can see eveyrbody and jump up and down with excitement and stuff! Lastly, are we gonna have a group photo at the ball? Or shall we just go in 2s or 3s? I don't think that we'll get eveyrone from our gruop in, so maybe it would be best to decide to go in 5s or summink? I dunno, I'll talk to donna see what she wants to do! Talk to y'all later guys

       ha ha ha yes. I think that verba; abuse was from me, in the form of "Tom you're a bastard!!!!", "fuck", "I bloody hate you" and "piss off". Needless to say, all those insults were when I was on a ride that scared the crap outta me, and Tom had lied to get me on there! So yeah, once again excuse the language but I feel it was justified!!!

Also went on rapids, loggers leap, stampede, detonator, tidal wave.  The journey home was HILARIOUS! We were taking the piss outta richard, and we found a dumped babies pram in the bin, so we pulled it out and, um, well....used it.  As shown here....Honestly, I really wish I had my vid cam.......

       WE GOT STARTED ON! Basically we were sitting on the bus and there wioz this lairy girl on there. I was supposedly staring at her so he told me fuck off ect... Me being me, i rolled my eyes at her and muttered whateva under my breathe. She then goes " Dont talk about me bitch or i will knock you out, so once again i rolled my eyes and said "ok". Then the girl shut up and us lot carried on talking. The girl moved forward though and started listwening to our convo. We started talking bout tom and thorpe park. She then comes out with: Is that Tom going out with a girl called amy. So i replied no not likely. Then she started having a go at me cause of the way i said it! Us lot continued talking and then she came out with: Dont talk about me so i replied erm i wasnt! then she went on bout how she was gonna knock me out so Darren started laughing, then she started having a go at him ect... Then she shut up and wee continued talking until mine and darren stop, as we went to get off the bus she said: Don't even try looking at me or i will get off and beat the shit outta you. So Nicki decided to get offf the bus with me and darren! The whole time she was talking in a black persons voice thinking she woz well hard. Grrr i really hate peeps like that, she is such a hoe! thats it.

       Right, lets re-run last night. Its now 12:30.  Apparently I have a virus on my system. NAV is auto-protect enabled, and I have run 4 different types of FULL virus scans. No viruses were found, maybe meaning TOM has a virus. Good luck Tom :D

       That was a very amusing blog Jackie, made me chuckle. Hey, proof now that you read the entries! Wahey! I hope you get a smashing tan on your holiday, its nice to have a tan, it makes you feel generally better about yourself. Oh, and I will give you my address when I next see you if you don't have the full one already. That is if you even want mine!  Oh yea i can write about everybody who fancies Simon the new boy!  wa? Can you flesh that out a bit please..... Glad you guys had fun at the concert :) I was listening to my sisters Bon Jovi album and it is pretty good. I prefer Bryan Adams though.  Bless you Max you really are obsessed. Posting on ere at 3 in the morning. Outrageous. Do you not sleep? Well today I am doing sod all so if anyone wants to go to the park to sunbathe and generally just mill about down there contact me before 1. LOL.

       Nothing can beat the tan I have on my waist :D Ok, ok, odd place, but its natrual and it kinda fades as it goes up my body. :S strange. Oh well, Nic likes it, lol.  There is a section of carpet in my room which STRONGLY smells of cheese, its awful. So, I went downstairs and under the sink was this Febreeze stuff (u must of heard of it on TV), so I thought I would give it a try. I sprayed it on, and the smell has gone all round the house. I now have a headache because of the strong Febreeze smell. I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH IT TONIGHT, ITS RIGHT BY MY BED :@ I would need Nic in bed with me to take my mind off it :D  Talking of Nic...   :D  P.S: That first picture of nic is the desktop background on my laptop :D

       I don't miss any science experiments cause they were always rubbish and most of the time we did them wrong ne way! And yes i admit i did the hands on bit except if it was to do with water and then i ended up having water fights with andy and max and getting shouted at by either micheele or Nicki to come and help! Oh the joys of science. I believe that pigs cannot fly as: 1. They have no wings 2. They are fat 3. they are useless 4. they just can't okay? Now i think i have eaten my dinner too quickly as i now have a rather annoying stomach ache which is pissing me off, maybe i just need the toilet??? LOL, jokes. No i don't i only went 10 mins ago! Now i am making an effort today to write as long blog as usually mine are really short and boring and i'm sure none of you guys/ gals read it cause i always seem to write about the same things! I would just like to say that i am really excited about Thorpe park and i can't wait to go on collosus and Nemises inferno... Again! I am also looking forward to my holiday as it will be great fun and i will come back with a smashing tan to put you all to shame! hehe. The only thing i'm not looking forward to is WAXING me legs ect... Cause you know i have to have beautiful legs cause i dont wanna be walking around all stubberly and looking like a man wearing a bikini/ swim suit. Now i would like to know your adresses so that just in case i decide to send a  postcard i can send one to you lot, usually i dont send postcards but i thought i would try something new this year! hmmm... What else can i write about? Oh yea i can write about everybody who fancies Simon the new boy! But i wont cause that is just boring. Now me i like the boy that was wearing the top with no arms, he had a sexy look to him, although i know for a fact he wouldnt look at me twice! Now i would like to say school sucks and that i hate it, but me being silly i am going back to take some stupid subjects then i'm gonna be even more stupid and then go to Uni. Although i havent decided on that yet as i dont know what i wanna do. That makes it slightly difficult when choosing courses and stuff. Now by now i should think your all thouraghlly bored stiff from reading the crap i have writeen above so i will sign off here!  Goodbye

       Hmm. Well as much as I need to get a job really I can't this summer because I will keep asking for days off here and there for that U-Project trip I am on. So I would probably get sacked within....2 weeks? Well I will def get a job towards the end of the summer/begining of sixth form because that is when all the Uni folk will quit their jobs as they head off to uni and their holidays with their friends. Hmm, this shall be interesting because what I am actually do right now is just typing so I can see if people actually read the posts on here. So I am going to ask and say random things, I will only know if you have read it by you mentioning it so lets have a lookie and see where this experiment goes. Speaking of experiments does anyone miss science experiments? I know in our set 1 class they could sometimes be hard but I thought our was of actually doing them was funny. Geting in one large group of 7 rather than the 3/4 we were supposed to be in...LOL. Then of course everyone has their own jobs. ie: I would take results, Max would time, Andy would refill the acid of whatever, Jackie always did the hands on part. It worked and made it fun. Hmm...can pigs fly? That's a scientific question. For my birthday this year I want to do something crazy...yes...I want to go horse riding! Woo! I have never been before and I think it would be a laugh. Hmm..I wonder if they have any jobs going at the nearby stables. That would be great. Working with horses. Ok ok, so it'd be mucking out but hey, its stil work and its physical work so it would look good to any future employers. Wahey! Sorted. I think. Moose.

       The 6th form induction days were ok. I took on that day ICT, AVCE Business, Media Studies, Design Tech. Then we left for daves at the beginning of 5th lesson for a sleepover. That was great fun; we dragged the dancemat, PS2, TV, DVD's, laptop and some other stuff downstairs to muck around with. In the morning, I got up and went down to the newsagent to get a copy of PCZONE UK, which has previews of Max Payne 2! Yay!  On my way home from Daves (I has to walk from Selsdon to Caterham) I thought to myself "Ah, I bet im gonna see somebody I know walking down Limpsfield Road, I bet it'll be Robert". Sod's law came into play; so yes, I saw Rob with his boyfriend walking down Limpsfield Road. At the bus stop just before I saw Rob, I thought I saw Nicki.J at the bus stop, and as my eyesight isn't very good, I couldnt make out who the person was, but I thought it was Nic. It turned out to be Robs mum! :-/  Hey! I walked through the park today on my way home! It was about 12:00 ish. When did you lot get there?  I can't resist posting this: (Sorry Nic!) :D    YUMMY!!!   My plan of the week: Saturday - Cry because Nic is going away for the whole week. Sunday - Nothing. Monday - Thorpe Park. Tuesday - Nothing. Wednesday - Nothing. Thurdsay - Nothing. Friday - Cry because i'm so happy Nic is coming home! :D Saturday - Talk to Nic. Sunday - Go to park with Nic!!!!! YAY!!!!!!

       Well guys! Won't be here for a while so I'm apologising in advance Nicki! Won't be around at all tomorrow, might make it Sunday morning, but after that I won't be around until WEdnesday night or possibly thursday due to my hectic schedule! Anyays, Gimmie something for the pain, gimmmie something for BLUEEEES, gimmie me somethig for the pain that I feel when I'm hanging on a hangman's nooooose, gimmie something for the pain, gimmie something I can usseeeee, can't remember the rest! oh no! Back to the CD! I'm listening to the White Stripes "Elephant" at the moment, it's really good! 'Seven Nation Army' is wicked, but there are some really good acoustic tracks on it too, I would think that Max and Nicki would proably like it, not sure whether Tom and Jackie would though?! Anyways......... Hmmmm. Cinema was good last night, 'Bruce Almighty' wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be, actually had me laughing quite a lot! Anyways, lolooking forwa rd to BonJovi soooooo much! I Can't describe how mcuh! Plus thorpe park too, h eh ehh e! Bye now, gtg to work!

       Today - park (hopefully but it looks like its gonna rain, grrr) Saturday - nothing Sunday - nothing Monday - nothing Tuseday - Keanu Film Day with Ashleigh Wednesday - Thorpe park! Thursday - nothing Friday - nothing. And that is next week planned out. Go me and my brilliant social life!  I thought yesterdays taser lessons were interesting. I am loking forward to the art and textiles courses although I was not impressed with the textiles taser. I mean, it was like being in a taster lesson for year 7. I sat there and weaved for 30 minutes. I mean, aaargh! Its so feminine! And sterotypical of women! Yes yes, I know its hard for the teachers to do taster lessons but still. And they were doing that typical thing teachers do "Oh how lovely!" next person "That looks nice!" next person "I like that colour". Argh! They don't actually mean the compliments!!!!!! EEEEEEEEEE! But anyways, histroy was amusing. Westy couldn't spell my name right, he did Nicky, Nickee and Nickie. Duh. NICKI. Geology was well, chaos because I had no idea what to do and felt stupid all over again so here we go back into the same old science routine of me being dumb. Art taster was great, I produced a nice chalk and charcol shell whcih I am rather pleased with and Miss Starky seemed to like it as well. English Lit I am really looking forward to. War literature and all. Engjoyed that. Amusing lesson.

       Well well, what a busy girl I am! Did practically nothign all day apart frmo go out for my nan's birthday lunch, and read HP all avo! However, tomorrow I'm booked in to read all morning (lol!), working from 12.30 till 4.30, going to a rehersal at 4.35 until 6pm, and then going to Michelle's house for a 'groupie' until 11pm! Wow! Then I need to be at work by 9am Saturday until 12.30 when I will depart so I can get a train to be in London by 2.30, ready to run in the gates of Hyde Park at 4pm, and screaming at BonJovi support acts by 7.30, then hollering at THE BonJovi by about 9-9.30ish! Wow! Then home by about 1ish, hopefully. Sholudn't be too late. Then I'm waitressing Sunday afternoon, 2 till 11pm i think, who knows with the lifestyle I'm leading at the moment?!!! At least I get paid. Oh yes, then Monday Thorpe Park. Oh and Tuesday rehersal at 12.30 till 1.30, shopping until 3pm, then back to school for another rehersal at 3.30. WEdnesday I've got an induction day at Oxted so I have to be out of the house by 7.45 in order to get the 8am train to Oxted! Then I probably won't be back before 5pm! Yay! Thursday I'm working all day for my dad. Friday I've actually got a day to relax, providing I'm not called into work! Woweeeeeeeeee I'm going to be exhausted! Anyways, how were the taster lessons today? Can't have been any more boring than my day, mind you! I'd like to know how Tom's unplanned history lesson went, lol! Nicki, what was art-textiles like? And how many external students got lost, ha ha?! Anyway, Tom I am coming to the rehersal tomorrow but late as I said earlier, I phoned Mrs Hicks (aren't I good!) to let her know, just so she doesn't have my head off when I finally arrive! Anyway gtg now, toooooodles!

I feel sorry for the external students, they won't know where half the rooms are! Bless! Slight panic last night. The fire alarm went off!! But there was no fire. So I am knackered now for wondering what the hell was going on. Hey, at least we know it will wake us up if there was an actualy fire.

       Well hello guys. I don't actually know why I'm saying hello though, seeings as you're all at school for your induction day, in which case: hope it's going/went well! I've just got back from my mum's work- I went to see if Harry Potter was delivered but it wasn't; so I've come back annoyed and I'm now munching through a box oc chocolates to make me feel better, lol. Probably just end up feeling sick. Oh well! Anywho, weather looks a bit grim today, cloudy, threatening to rain, and where I am it smells like a bonfire, yet again! Yuck mocha. *bins current chocolate* I dunno what to do now. I was hoping to read hp, but it isnt here so I'm annoyed, as previously stated. I suppose there's always the tennis to watch, but the minute I turn on the tv it'll start raining in wimbledon and they'll have to abandon play, it always happens when I sit down to watch! Anyway we know what'll happen: One of the Williams sisters will win the ladies, Tin Henman will do a dramatic crash out in the quater finals, and some obscure russian will win. Probably. well like I said, hope everything went ok today, I can't wait for my indcutvion day next week, hopefully it'll be good! talk yo y'all later now

       Aww, sorry your Alton Towers trip has gone wrony. Maybe in that summer between collage and uni you guys can actually go for a weekend? Stay in a hotel and all that jazz. Jenny has a birthday on 7th August which I am not here for because of my summer trip. I get to go go-karting! Yippe! Proper helmets and all! Yes I agree Tom, they don't realise how lucky they are. Even if their birthday is in the summer most people are free to go to the cinema or something. Birthdays in Decemember just don't work well. But i am used to it now so I don't bother with my birthday anymore. Its pointless so no need to make a fuss. As much as I would like a surpise party or something it just wouldn't happen. What is everyones plans for the summer then? The induction days are on wed and thurs. Tomorrow I am going shopping in London with my sister. At some point father and I will be going to the war & peace show which I can't wait for. Tom and I have 2 trips planned which should be a blast. Jackie and I will be off to Thorpe Park next week with Ben and Si, yay! That is about it.

       One of the best things was too see everybody so relaxed! No more exam stress, just chilling out. So thanks Jo. Unfortunatly Railtrack or Network Rail or whatever on earth our train network is called at the moment, have moved a few stations around and in the doing so, they moved the train that goes to Alton Towers. So now, not only is the journey longer, but we get less time in the park, and they put the price up! The cheek of it! There is a big difference between £33 and £38 for a day out. So I'm giving cheques/cash back to people because I don't think it's really worth it any more. Grrrrrrrr. Flipping trains. The next birthday I believe is Jackies? 23rd or 24th of July? Followed by Max's on the 23rd or 24th of August. All these people with nice summer birthdays! Lucky things you are. Don't know how good they've got it, do they Nicki? ;)

       This is a celebrity blog as I am blogging from Andy's house! We taking part in the Warlingham Fate tomorrow and our Brazil team have a stall there. We have crockery and a few bits and bods to throw balls at. Hopefully get a load of money to help towards our trip. The ICT exam was pretty much as expected, only one question got me was "Name four features of the 1998 Data Protection Act" which I could not remember at all, but never mind. After talking to Barry, I am on the C/B border. That's it! All over! No more exams, and now a nice relaxing extra long summer to look forward to. Andy is watching every word I type, so I better not let out too many secrets, hehe. Looking forward to what should be a very interesting party tomorrow!

       Hi Hi Hi. Well today I accompanied my friend Sarah job hunting, she's so fussy though! She can't work saturdays cos she dances, she can't do after school because she dances, so basically she wants a holiday job that lets her leave at 3.30 everyday, and no weekends. hmmm. We started off in Hamsey Green, but no luck their, just a lot of application forms. We then walked down to sanderstead and we thought we'd got osme luck cos there was s sign in the bakers, but they said they'd already filled it, they just hadn't bothered to take the sign down! So no luck in the rest of the shops in Sanderstead, so we hopped on a bus into Croydon. Clarks said they take on holiday people which was good so we collected a form, and Clintons had a vacancy but it included a Saturday, so no luck. every other shop (Marks, BHS, Alders, HMV, Virgin, Waterstones etc etc) said they haven't got any vacancies till August/October/Christmas. Fun. So we then walked out of Croydon along the Brighton Road to go to 2 music shops, and no luck either! Collapsed into a bus stop on the Brighton Road, looked up and saw a restaurant had a sign in the window advertising for waiters/waitresses, so we went in as a last resort, cos she could do that as it would be evenings! The people in there were so nice and I got a free drink while I waited for her so I was happy after a long day! She got a trial, and then the bloke told me I could aswell! So we're both trainee Waitresses now, lol! Very strange day. Went all round the world, ended up with a job I didn't know I wanted, and then spent the rest of the afternoon in Selsdon Primary photocopying log books from 1955.  Can't be assed to go to IT cos I went yesterday and it was pants, so I'm going to do some revision of my own. Perhaps. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows?!

       Well hello people. What a bizarre day it was yesterday weather-wise! Sunny and warm in the morning, but by the time I got off the tube in London, it was chucking it down! Then, when I came out of a shop, it was beautifully sunny again! Fortunately my friend and I avoided all the rain, because we decided to get a bus back to Victoria instead of the tube, cos we couldn't acutlly find a tube station and we didn't fancy getting wet! The bus was quite odd, we got a seat so it was the first time we'd sat down all day, and it was some dodgy old bus that took us practically half way round london on it's way to victoria, but at least we got to see some nice places, lol!  Today the weather is beautifully sunny again (although it's quite windy), which  is a damn good job too, cos I'm going to be out and about again today! The only problem is the wind, so I'll have to go and do a wind test with my clothes- put on one outfit, stand in the garden for five minutes and see how cold I get, then change to the next outfit and so on until I get a combination that I'm happy and warm in, lol! Anyone else have any strange methods of deciding what to wear?  Anyway, must go because my hair is an absolute mess and I've got to deal with it pronto! Have fun at the park (whoever's going!) and I'll probbaly talk to some of you lot later! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

       Ok Jo. Fair enough.  Today I am going into Croydon with Jackie because we both have some shopping to do. So that should be a good laugh. I never did go to the garden centre because I went to Jackie's house instead and went on her dance mat. I cannot do it at all!!! I get all confuzzeled. While I was doing the lessons Jackie was whooping at some kids in their paddling pool. Hmm. Anyone guess what Jackie will be when she is older...... LOL. Jokes.

       What lucky folk you are.  I have been having a bit of a bad weekend to say the least. But I will discuss that in a mo. First of all tomorrow I have a textiles exam. Woppe. In the afternoon I am going to the garden centre with father because I need to get a proper cactus house for my cactuses because after 3 years of neglect they are alive! So now I intend to keep them all nice and healthy. Tuseday I am going to Croydon with Jackie to get Jo's pressies. I am also intending to but myself a few CD's and some matrix posters....hehe. Wednesday we should have the park. Loads of people haven't emailed me back on whether they are coming or not yet. Grrr. So spread the word people. Thursday I am not sure what I am doing. Friday is the day of reckoning with the Information Communications Technology test. Sorry, I think it sounds so much better athn ICT or IT. LOL. Today I have been reading on of my books. Did you do in WHSmith you can get any 2 books for ust £10? That is a good deal, and they have some good books on the shelves too!  So my dilemea. I have the sixth form letter. And guess what. I have subjects that clash. Wopee. But then guess what. The 2 subjects which clash are the 2 subjects I reeeeally need to do for my future career. Grrr. I wouldn't care so much if I had to drop Geology or English lit but I have to choose between HISTORY and ART/TEXTILES. HOW THE HELL DOES THE FLIPPING SIXTH FORM EXPECT ME TO DO THAT? I MUST DO BOTH OF THOSE COURSES!!!!!!!!!! I will be on a rampage tomorrow as I must go and complain to Miss H then to Mr V. Anyone care to join me? Grrr.

       Grrrr, i hate my computer. Well i went to Croydon today, the main reason was cause my sister forgot to take the photo chip with her to wokr this morning, so i went in and gave it to her. The most surprising thing was that she then payed for my bus fairs and ALSO brought me lunch !!! I then went on to buy myself some nice shorts for which i am wearing now and a top, which on the back has written: kik my arse, or something to that effect. I have also sunbathed today although not for too long as it was a bit too hot unless it weent hazy! Ne way enough said by mee, until the next time i blog...

       Today I have done nothing apart from get up, eat, and turn my hair a bizarre colour. Other than that I've been relaxing in the garden, now a small matter of exams is out of the way (well, apart from that thing called IT that I really don't intend to revise for!). Got quite a busy week planned, what with heart scans, day trips, revision classes and birthday parties all in the mix, but I'm looking forward to it because I only have to step onto the school premises for one occasion next week, and that would be the thing they call  IT, yet again. But gtg dry my hair now, and hope it hasn't turned green, cos it sure smells mighty funny at this moment in time. Toodles peeps

       Yay! Everyone is blogging! I went to Croydon today with meine mutter to get fathers day pressies and other pressies. I also managed to get a top for Jo's party but the only problem with it is that I have to get someone else to tie it up at the back. Lol. So no one better un-do it. Grrr. I also brought some fish net tights! Again LOL. And I got some hair straighters which are cool because yes, they actually work! Wooo! What a really nice day it is today. Who wants to go down the park next week? So long as it is hot that is. I am thinking Wednesday. Tell me what you think.

       Grrrr, im a tiger! Well in my head maybe? I'm kinda bored at the moment, there is nothing to do anymore unless you have bucket loads of cash to randomly spend, and even if you have bucket loads of cash you still can't go out cause your mates havent got any money! You just can't win these days.  Well i have a very weird dream last night and it involved Ben Webb, i won't go into too much detail, but he was in jail in the peodofile unit and i was in a seperate bit but aslo in jail! Unfortuantly i woke up so i can't remember much more than that. All i know is that it was quite weird. I don't even know why we were in jail! grrrr. Well later on today i am going into Croydon with Darren to get a Father's day present for my Father and hopefully i am going to get Jo's present also, But i might just not bother getting Jo anything. ( I hate her) Nah i'm jokin, it all depends on whether i can find what i am looking for! Today looks like it is gonna be good, hopefully i can top up my tan so that when i go on holiday i will already be tanned and people will think i have be there for ages already! Lol. Well thats all i can think to write about at this time so i will sign off! GOODBYE

       Goodness me! Goff is still on MSN Messenger! Dear oh dear. History. I'm not really sure. I'm pretty confident I got at least a C for paper 2, because I was very revised up on that (thanks Jo!) but paper 1, I'm not sure I did very well at all on, like everybody else. So I really am on the C/D border for that. Not particually happy, but hey, either that or go live in a ditch. Yes! That's it, exams are over apart from some random ICT paper. All done and dusted. So now is the time to start planning the summer, and then at the end of the summer think about all the things you were going to do but never did because you spent your whole time going to parites or recovering from parties. My back really hurts now because the chair I was sitting in for all 1 hour and 45 minutes of that extra tireing Austria rehersal was all bent in the middle, so I couldn't sit up straight at all! Felt like somebody was poking me the whole time. Maybe it wasn't my chair and David was just being kinky. Hehe. Kinky sailors - why weren't hey in the history paper? One of my primary school buddies who I see every month-or-two was over this evening with her family, always good to talk about the good old days. Sort of miss them, but they were all snobs apart from a few of us. All at Trinity and other posh schools now. Don't care about us lot no more.  Jo - remind me about seeing her because she said something really nice you want to hear!  They have moved the 6th form timetable around a bit since I last saw it. So I am doing AVCE Media, Business & Economics and Geography. The plan is to do ICT, but I don't really fancy it, it's just the only thing I'm actually any good at. But it's either that or something else from 12B and 12D. Grrrr. I'll shut up now. One too many Cokes and a whole lot of ice cream!

       I had a veyr nice day thanks, sat in the sunshine and revised with Tom all afternoon. Thankfully the history exam today was a lot easier than the first one, uuuurgh. After the exam I got the bus into croydon with michelle cos I was supposed to be meeting my friend Sarah but Michelle ended up tagging along, and what an amusing day it was! Michelle made it her policy to try on the most ridiculous outfit in every shop, and boy did we laugh a lot! Quite a bit of a relief after the exams, and I'm happier now cos I know that Sarah is going to get on with my friends at ma party! yay! A week to go, h ehe! Gtg, I've just dropped ice cream on me keyboard so I bette clear it up! Be!

       I am 16 too. I have been so for 5 months (I think..is June the fifth month?) and 13 days. Welcome to the club Jo. I hoep you had a lovely day and I will give you your present at your party. Which I am looking forward to greatly. I have a skirt. Which is like a belt. Heehee.  The history exam was ok I thought. It went well. I have noticed something rather amusing in the history exams. Everyone does it including me. On each question no one just sits there and writes it all. Everyone tends to just sit there and not write or anything while they try and figure the question out. Its actually quite funny to watch. All these students with papaers open, only about 20 mins into the exam staring into space. LOL. How amusing.  Could Tom and Max please blog.

       Well, what an utter load of b******s that history exam was. Weston and his bloody 'Only revise the beginning and the middle cos you don't have to do questions on the end' and then what happens, the whole friggin' lot is on the end. Dammit. Well, actually more than damn it, I am very upset and very peed off with history teachers right at this moment in time. DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT. and a whoel load more of 4 letter words. you know, I actually opened the paper, saw the question and said "shit". I was that annoyed and upset. Reall pissed off. sorry to keep going on about, but I've worked so hard and it's all been ruined.  Other than that, It think maths was ok but it was definetly harder than the first paper, but that wasn't really a suprise to me cos I was expecting a hard ppaer, lol!  not looking forward to french tomorrow, but at least it's the last one, then I only have two more exams to go! yay! Plus it's my birthday on thursday so I get a nice relaxing day with no exams!" yay!

       I get freaky dreams. They are even freakier when they are about people you know and love and something bad is happenng to them. That's really horrible, when you wake up in a sweat and crying cos it's so scary and it seems real. I hate those type of dreams. Anyway! Science this morning was okish, harder than the other exam but Mr Stickland succeeded in messing up my questions 4- the minute I had done it anbd turned the page he said "I#m sorry to say that we've just noticed a mistake in question 4" and i thought 'oh bloody hell, here we go' and then I had to re-write the whole of the quesiton and made a mess of it. 5 minutes later, "I'm sorry but we made a mistake, there  wasn't  a mistake in question 4. So I had to re-write the whole bloody thing again, except I was out of space cos I had already written it twice. Honestly. Flamin' teachers. Right now I need some food. Marmite on toast followed by chocolate fingers sounds like a good idea.  Oh guys you will laugh so much when you see my birthyda cake, it's going to be so funny and soooo sickly!! he he he he!  Good luck in english everyone, although I'm sure no-one will need it cos you just make english up as y ou go along, being creative and arty-farty etc etc. Toooodles!

       I remember Umbongo, just not the song either. Just that it was hilariously funny. I had a freaky dream last night. The first bit was that Michelle didn't have a calaculator in the science exam today. Then this bit is to do with Jackie. It was  that day  in July and when the four of us got off the bus at  the destination  the other two circle of love members managed to rush off into  the lines  and we totally lost them. Hmm. It does not bode well hey? Well I am wetting myself about the science exam today. I will probablty be really depressed on my departure of the exam hall. Wopee. Althouogh I am looking forward to Thursday where Jackie and I will be shopping with the circle of love. That should be fun. Very fun. If you know what I mean Jackie. The group can bond. Heehee. Well, the internet is kinda boring lately although I have taken greatly to  urlLink faceparty.com . That is rather fun. I will also be getting my own domain in a few weeks which should be good.

       Umbongo, Umbongo, who else remembers the advert fomr when we were really ickle? My aunty used to give me umbongo cartoons cos I loved the advert on the Tv and i can still remember the pictures, but I can't remember the words! Aww. Just been looking at all our family photos from when we were really young and stuff, quite funny cos I was the fattest little child with the most awful hair ever, and i was always covered in food! lol, not much's changed then! Well work today was fun, Tina bought her daughter Kinnou in who is three, and she is sooo sweet! She's got cerebal palsy which means she is quite backward (being brain damaged), she is very very tiny and she can't talk properly, but she is such a happy and cheeky child it is soo funny! She was driving Tina beserk today cos she was tripping up all the customers cos she's so small and doesn't register what's going on around her, and then having sung happy birthday to herself and been told off by a customer for making too much noise (jokinlgy), she ran round and round the shop screaming it at him, following him everywhere, and then stood in the doorway and screamed it a t him as he walked off up the road, then turned around and burst out laughing- she is soo cheeky cos she knows she's been naughty! Anyway, to keep her out of the customers' way I tried to get her to help me dust the shelves, by giving her all the products and getting her to line them up on the floor. This was fine for a while until she decided she wanted to help me take stuff off the shelves too, so I gave her the small stuff to do because she can't managed anything else. She was taking the little liquid ant killer tubes off the shelf, and dropping them down onto the floor, and then she stepped forawrd to try and rech the ones at the back, and trood on the reast of the ant liquid tubes, and they exploded everywhere, covering the floor, my trousers and her ickly feet in sticky ant killer stuff. Yuck. And what does she say? "oopsey" and smiles cheekily at me. Kids eh??!

       Maths annoyed me. There was a question about the mean number and all I could think of was the advert where that man goes 'can you spot the mean number' and one number takes an ice cream from the other then hits him. Dammit. I would've been so depressed last night if it weren't for lovely Jackie. 2nd July.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Jo's party. 21st June.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Party In The Park. Whenever that is......hehe. Then I was reading the email Si sent me aasking fi I did actually want to go to the cinema or was it just Jackie messing about. Hehe.

       Well maths! Yay! I am actually quite relieved now cos I was dreading maths, but then I found it easier than the mock and it seemed to be largely based on algebra, which I find ok! I didn't get twhat a box plot was though, only to be told by Dina that it is the same as a box and whisker!! doh!!  That's annoying, but it's only 3 marks and I sholdu have worked that one out anyway, lol! So yyeah, ii am ok with that. Tomorrow I have englsih in the morning and Geography in the afternoon, 3 and a half hours in total of essay writing- not quite my idea of fun!

       yeah. French was quite blugh too. Evil. And then we got our ball pictures back which cheered me up. However, the lady in pupil services tried to bite my head off, so that wasn't good. But yeah it's a really nice picture that we've got, yay! And I saw Nicki's and she looked fab, I didn't see the rest of people though! I've just got back from makros and ASDA. In makros we bought all manner of fizzy drinks and sweets for my party (including 600 marshmellows!!!), and then in ASDA we bought lots of crisps and stuff, so we now have everything we need for a party! yay! I even pursuaded mmu to buy me my own personal supply of alcopops! yay!  Anyway got to go cos my eye is giving me grief, hope maths goes okay for everyone (I'm gonna fail). Bye!

       Wisewoman hey?  Yes, two things you should know about the wisewoman, first she is a woman!  Ah ha.  And the second...  ...she is wise?  Yeah! Do you know her then?  No, just a wild stab in the dark, which incidently is what you'll be getting if you don't shut up and tell me where she is.  My holiday was lovely. Best bit was when we took a yacht, found a deserted bay and went swimming - fantastic! Piccies back on Thursday so I'll post a few at the weekend or somethin'. Exams: blugh. 'nuff said.

       Rah well I'm guessing this is going ot be my last post for a while, as I'm off to Spain tomorrow morning! Yay! I bet it rains for the whole journey down there though, which won't be very interesting seeings as we have to drive cos my dad is too stingy to pay out for air fares. But hey ho, that's life I guess. Um. Other than that, I haven't been doing much at all! Yesterday I went to CAterham to the dentist, and that was a bundle of laughs as usual. Then bought a book on M15 since the Cold War and the changing faces of espionage whcihc will take my mind off things when GCSE results are out. Um, fun. Yeah, life seems to be all doom and gloom atm, i'm sure it's not really, just through a teenager's eyes it is. Well I can't really thnk of anythign else to say cos my jammy dodgers are yelling ast me from inside my tummy (i think I ate too many in too short a space of time), and, um, just to say hi Jackie an dMax have a nice summer, Nicki hope u had fun on your trip thingy, and Tom don't forget to go to work! Bye!

       I went into town yesterday, and I bought me a cosmic  urlLink ColourSplash Flash . It's like a normal flash, but it flashes different colours, making the subjects in your photos come out in beautiful ab-normal colours. Cosmic stuff. I also bought a pretty cosmic hippy top to add to my new look. Deep red, with black and white patterns. I've got all my Austria photos etc back! This photo below is taken outside the Tate Modern. Read the bin.   I'll look though the others and post a few goodies later.

       Homesickness is a pain, 10 days into the Morocco trip and I was missing Nic. (And home of course; they dont call it homesickness for nothing).  Well today has been interesting. Went to the park with Nic and she got a lift back to her house at the end, which as you know is like 200m up the road. I got very upset, considering I had to ride 2.5km back to Caterham. Ah well, that took me exactly 6 minutes to complete the journey :D  Onto other things, I'm painting Nics bedroom tomorrow. Should be fun :) Whey! About a week ago I got my Wireless router. I can now rome my house on the laptop using the internet wirefree and not have my main computer on to do so. Merry Christmas folks.

        I smell like water lily and lavender.  I just went swimming and my dad brought with us water lily and lavender shower gell. Cosmic. The tour was not as good as Prague, probably something to do with the weather (or at least I can blame it on the weather). A very alone tour for me because I didn't have all that many people to talk to. When I wasn't pissing Jo and Donna off, or hanging around with the year 8/9s I was all by myself, which isn't fun for a week. So I got rather home sick, which I don't usualy get when I'm away. My photos come back in 3 days time, so I'll post 'em up then. I've text Nicki to see how she is, but no reply yet. Glad to be home.

       Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah everybody, I'm home at long last. Austria was ok, not as good as Prague, hotel was horrible, food was yuck, trips were ok, hanging with friends was a laugh. Other than that, raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah and now I am extremely tired even htough I've had about 24 hours sleep since I got home at 7am yesterday morning. Raaaaaaaaaah. Anywho, just bought some vegetable curry from Somerfield so must go cook and munch before I start on packing (yes packing raaah cos I'm going away again on Friday raaaaaah). Raaaaaaaah. Ask Tom about week, he knows more than I do generally raaaaah.

I'll have my mobile with me everyone so if your bored text moi, I should have a signal and hopefully there will be somewhere to charge it. I'll let ya'll know how Alton Towers works out, air....

       I see the British summer has arrived. Its raining. I brought the cutest bikini today. Its a camo one and is so cool. I'll wear it, well the top half anyway, under my clothes in Cumbria so if I do get chucked in the lake or something I won't be too wet.  I'm bored. Minesweeper anyone?

       Well, it has been a somewhat interesting week. I'm having Nic round on Friday, and we r going out for a meal :) I also sprayed one of my PC's black:    The white bits on the case is dust. The type of spray paint I used makes the dust stick like shit to a blanket. Also, I have yet to spray the CD-ROM drive. As you can see, it has been removed.

We are camping over night somewhere apparently which will be good and may have the choice to go horse riding whcih I haven't done before. I am really looking forward to it!

       Yay yay yay! Jackie's back! Went go-karting yesterday. Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuude how awesome is it!!!!!! We all got into teams of 5, our team was me, Helen, Pennie, Shelly and Ashley's girlfriend Stacy. We lost. But we had fun! I have two nice bruises on the inside of my knees now from where I kept hitting the steering wheel, painful but worth it! I drive like a man apparently. Hehe. You know, instead of going around the corners nice and slowly I rip around. Well, I try to. Lol. I didn't crash! Woo!

       hmmmm, What to write? Well, my holiday was good, it only rained once and that was for 3 minutes. Getting a sunbed was bloody stupid. Each morning my dad got up at about 6 to try and get a sunbed with an umbrella. Of course they had all already gone! So in the end he gave up and got up at 8 instead to get one without a umbrella. We visited Palma, the main town of Majorca, but it was an hour and a hlaf bus journey from where we staying! grrr. Our hotel was very nice, it had a big swimming pool, stage area, tennis courts, football courts, lots of shops, a burger bar, a pizzeria, a park, a volleyball bit and lots of bars. Also it was so close to the beach it took you about a minute to get onto the beach if you got out of the swimming pool! Erm... Didn't really meet anyone which was a bit annoying, but it didnt bother me too much as i was never bored. The simming pool had a slide! YAY I got my hair done again like last year. And the good thing was that it was 20 euros cheeper! Plus there were trampolines outside of the complex up the road so i was happy! I think i spent to much money on them though. well thats all i cant hink of to write at the mo so if u wat more details talk to me

       Cooooool, good for you Nicki! Very amusing picture Tom, you make me feel like an adolescent alocoholic. Ha ha, but it's only a bit of fun! OOoh still got to pack camera. Must remember that. Camera. Camera. Camera. Right! Um. Well work today was ok as per usual, nothing really exciting happened, and I didn't even get to do the trolley again (having been so chuffed with myself last week). But it was ok. Got a couple of good books from the library to take to Asutria, including George Orwell's "Animal Farm" which I hear is a historic read. Other than my toilteries and my lunch, I all set to go tomorrow! Should be fun, but I'm not really looking forward to a 24 hour coach journey now I know what it's like (havign done it for Prague). Well I sholud go cos I haven't got much else to say, I won't be back to next Monday probably. Then on the friday, I'm off again! yay! So have a good week y'all, and chat to ya when i get back (apart from Tom who is on the same trip, duh). Byeeeeeee guys! Oh Jackie hope you had a good holiday, tell me all about it when I get bcack!

       Wahey!  3500+ military vehicles on display, tanks, jeeps, ferrets, champs, weapons, explosions, living history reenactors, huge arena events, 1940s fashion, 1000+ stalls, world war two memorabilia, military models, 1940s history, fun fair and more!  Yesterday I rode on a tank, £5 which seems alot for a short ride but its well worth it! I have developed a new liking for tanks now. And Hummers. I love Hummers now. Hummers are basically like the jeep just ALOT bigger. You can see them in Black Hawk Down. This year they had a Iraqi tank there which drew a lot of interest. People come from all over to see the show, Dutch, French (pah!), German, even American! One day i hope to be involved somehow, maybe with my own vechiles. I wouldn't mind owning a  urlLink jeep  or  urlLink hummer  (big ol beasts!) when I'm older. Maybe ever a half track! Now  urlLink half tracks  really are nifty little things.

       Well well well. O to be an army brat hey? Spent the day at the War & Peace Show. Going again today. Got some 2 used combats, 2 for £10, not bad and today I will hopefully get the camo jacket to go with it (£5) so I'm happy. I got to ride on a tank yesterday which was so much fun. The track was all bumpy and dirty and we were whizzing along I tells ya! That was my second tank ride so far, its worth it. I am eyeing up a job with tanks, the great beasts of a armored vechile!  Jackie comes back today or tomorrow. Not sure which but I'll be soooooooo happy when she comes on msn. I'll be all grinning and cheering.

       Hello guys. Long time no blog, etc etc. Well. Today Paul came round and we watched a film and then stuff, ya know?! Without wanting to go into too much detail, just letting you know what I'e done today. Seems the Great British summer is over all ready, it's been overcast, raining and windy all day, but I can see just an ickle bit of blue sky over there now?!  Oh no, just disappeared beind that big 'orrible cloud again. Ah well, we'll have to see what tomorrow brings I guess. um.  Tomorrow I am working from 12.30 till 4.30 which will get me some extra dosh, then working the usual hours on Saturday. Then Sunday- I'm off to Austria!!!! Yahooooooooooooo! I'm trying to pack at the moment but I'm having a bit of a crisis cos I can't find my little black vest top anywhere! Where the hell is it? I've turned my room, my sisters' rooms a=nd the bathroom upside down, still no sign of it!  I can't go without it! Other than that, I think I'm decided on what CDs to take, what clothes to take, I definetly need a hair drier, Thais bites and dried fruit, then after that I will bung in as many more clothes that will possibly fit! he he. Clarinet is not going in suitcase this year, I will just shove it in the hold on the coach, seeings as last time I wasted precious suitcase space by trying to get it in! Was so devestated when I found out I could have left it out and taken more clothes! Anywho, that is about it. My top 5 CDs for the trip are going to be "Jagged Little Pill" by Alanis Morisette, "New Jersey" and "Cross Roads" by Bon Jovi, "Idol Hits" by Billy Idol and "Meatloaf and friends" by various artists (duh). Top beauty product: Nail file. Best holiday book: yet to find it! Ah that reminds me- got to go and get one!!!

       I don't see the point in Sky subscriptions etc. It'll be shown on the BBC or somthing soon anyway. When I move house, i'm going to cancel the liscence subscription, I hardly watch any TV.  Lee and I have made our own office in Warlingham school! yay! Its a bit like the server room, only more organised. Currently Lee is making his custom made "Compaq" and I am writing this.

       Ahhh, packing for holidays. Finding out how much of your walldrobe you can fit in your bag. Deciding which music to take, removing the ones you probably won't listen to, then put the whole lot in. Making lists of everything you are going to forget, and then forgetting it. Ah the joys.

       Cool, sounds wicked Nicki! How long is it for, and when?! Well, I've got four whole days left until I set off to Austria, which should be fun! howvere, I'm not looking forward to the concert side of things, a) because I am veyr unsure of the words in some songs (ummm!) and b) because I am apparently 'middle alto' so I have a little part all to myself (oh and Sally and the girl who can't sing), I can't hear either of them, my sister has deserted me, I didn't know I was supposed to be singing it until Friday, and um, I can't do it! Other than that it shoudl be fine. Oh apart from the small matter of Chango Mangos which I can't do either, me and bloody volunteering for solos. Ah yes, news flash: David T blatanly fancies Louise. PERVERT! Will explain when I see people; " just wanted to let you know your sister sang a solo, she was the better than everybody else there and I coludn't believe it was her". We all know what you're like David.......

       Well I had a fun day at work, met the lady who has been on maternity leave, was quite interesting actually. Alpa has had a baby called Shey, and was covering for Tatuna today so she could take her kids out for the day (btw Tatuna is Tina's real name, I can see why she shortens it to Tina instead of Tuna). We got a lot of work done, and had a laugh at Alpa who couldn't remember a thing after 3 months off and swore quite a lot!!! Anyways! Tom has just accepted to do my job while i#'m on holiday, which proably means he'll get to meet Kinnou and Kishan, although kishan won't speak to anyone anyway, kinnou just throws herslef at random strangers!

       We need Jackie. She keeps everyone talking or rather posting. Plus her posts can be rather amusing. I miss Jackie.  Well, right then. Wednesday. Tom and I went on up to London and he has already said what we did. The guns you can move were great fun. My arms are all muscly now, lol. Well we kept pointing them at on coming boats and then following them as they went by which was great fun. It was great being a kiddie again. Hehe. The musems were interesting, well, what we saw. I think they will have to be made into proper day outs then we can actually do all the exhibits. Oh yea - Bow, stern, starboard and port. WAHEY! It wasn't that bad wandering around trying to find the photo shop. It was worth it. Its cute. hehe. And the lady was really nice. I liked her. Yay. So yesterday I did sod all. Today I went shopping in Bromly with my sister. Got some cheap clothes in the sales. Wahey! I have alos just figured out how to make my own CD!!!!! So far I have made a 'Rock On!! A Nikko Production.' album. Over the coming weeks I will make a party album and 'Nikko's Greatest Love Songs'. If you want copies you will have to give me a CD and I will make one. Hehe.  Um, what else. Max BLOG.  Park on Sunday should be good. Nic and Jen will be joining us for once. Wahey. One last note, you know you got a willing slave you just like to play the thought that you might misbehave but since I'm only dead to you I'm saying stay away. Get it?

       I haven't blogged for a while, so two days worth of blogging!  On  Wednesday  I dragged Nicki all the way round London.  In this order, or some variation of it, we... Went to the HMS Belfast and looked around that for a couple of hours. The coolest bit has to be these massive guns that you can move around and point at stuff, so we threatened boats on the river. I'm sure Nicki has some cool things to say about the boat. It really was pretty amazing. Nicki now knows all the parts of the boat, and what the different flags are called, hehe. Then we wondered down towards South Bank along the river side, up to the Tate Modern. Didn't go in, but just had a quick look. Then we got the tube all the way over to South Kensington (near Hyde Park) and had lunch in my favourite resturant. Then we looked around the Natural History Museum (the Life and Earth sections). Followed by a quick tour of the Science Museum. Then we went back into the city to Westminster and went to "the door" featured in Die Another Day the Bond movie. It's the one on the other side of the river to the Houses or Parilment where Bond goes to meet M in the underground station. Then we bought a ticket for a boat back to South Bank, but while we were waiting we went up to the London Eye to have a look. £5! Not bad, do that one day. Then we bought ice creams and went to watch protesters in Parliment Square. They where campaigning for the legalisation of canabis. One blokes sign said "Free the Weed". Then we had a lovely boat trip up the Thames to South Bank, where we went up into Farringdon where I got us lost for a few minutes looking for this tiny little photography shop. I found it in the end, although Nicki wasn't too impressed. How was I supose to know there where two post offices? Anyway, we went in there, and because I had rung the lady in the shop up asking how to get there, and after telling her our little story she gave us some free postcards. Then we joined the rest of London and got a train home.  Today  I did nothing.

       Well I really enjoyed PITP. It was a great day out minus those cheesy feet and the fact that I too got burnt. But once I got home I slapped on lots of after sun. The train on the way back was funny. LOL. All together now - hehe. Good laughs. Good memories and good memories is what is imporant.  I went to Ash's house last night and we spent 8 hours on the Nintendo playing Bomberman and stuff. Then we watched 4 films one of which was Not Another Teen Movie which is one of the funniest movies ever. It was a good laugh. I have now seen the Ali G film, I wasn't that impressed I have to say. Dirty Danicng is always good to watch and so is The Sixth Sense. So I went down the park today. I was not impressed. I got down there and no one was to be seen so I rang Helen and she said they were in the woods and she would come a find me in a mo seeing as I didn't know where they were. So I sat there and waited. And waited. No one came. So I rang / text again and I was told to 'come and find us, its a game' to which my reply came as 'no, I am not in the mood to piss about'. Still I waited. And you know what I am like when people ignore me or leave me alone so I walked back up the Dobbins and headed home. I met Lora on the way so I turned around and went back as it was a relatively nice day. Sure enough as Lora was there they came out and we sat around all day. Which I didn't mind seeing as I was / am tired. Oh, and its fun to the be the butt of everyones jokes and jibes. Thanks a lot. I miss Jackie.

       What really worried me was the fact that Pingu was the one suggesting I used voodoo. I'm not quite sure who is going to the park and who is not, all I know is that I'm not, partly because I'm sitting here. I know Nicki isn't going, and Jackie can't go for geography reasons. Jo is in school. So it's probably just Max then.

       What the............................? Random comments! Random comments! Anyway, I had a VERY interesting conversation last night, won't go into details but involved mu Pingu, and Tom mblatantly didn't like the fact that Pingu is getting more action than him cos Tom says he's going to put Pingu and  Tony Blair in a box together and practice Voodoo on them, which is a bit unfair for me, although I woulnd't care if he blew Tony Blair up, I wolud be veyr upset if he practiced Voodoo on my Pingu, so STAY OUTTA IT! Anyways enough of that, I'm going up to school later and I think I shall wear my very mini skirt, which means I need to go and paint my toe nails! Yay papmering time! yay! Anyways see y'all later dudes. Apart from Jackie who is on holiday. Bye!

          Replace cabage for something that sounds alike to froging   Which cabage idiot put cabage Heathrow airport all the cabage way over there?  Take an age to get from cabage Victoria to cabage Heathrow. Probably worth going all the cabage way to cabage Paddington and then paying another cabage £12 to get the cabage express all the way over cabage there. Just move cabage Heathrow into the middle of cabage London, job cabage done. Planes will probably get the caught in the cabage congestion zone and get charged a cabage fiver, and a couple of cabage speeding tickets. "Excuse me British Airways, but your vehicle was doing 350km/h" cabage Ken would probably say. Stupid cabage country.

       So you enjoyed it then Tom? I wasn't sure whether you were going to l ike it or not (seeings as u are a Moby fan etc etc), but I think you enjoyed it? PErhaps not quite so much as Bon Jovi, but after such a wicked concert anything would be hard to follow! And Nicki, I had a fab day with yo u and Helen and Tom, was a good group to go with, and I have a big bruise on my back from when u knocked me over taking my shoe off! But I had fun. Meatloaf was really good, I can live happily ever after now I've seen him do the full version of "Bat out of Hell" live, I felt a bit lonely tho cos nobody else knew all the words (well, apart form the old fogies!) but hey, I had fUN! I am very burnt though, and it is rather painful. My back is all prickly and so are my shoulders, and my face is quite a strange pinkish colour! Not a good look, especailly when wearing a red t-shirt, but I suppose it's my own fault really. Anyway! Yay! Probably come back alter.

I am going to have a section with my photos, including quite a few of my cats, so once that is up you can take them if you really want, but I would prefer a link to my site.

WEll anyway Paul came round this morning and we chilled and listened to music, then I went to work and got myself covered in bathroom sealant, then I came home to change before the rehersal, and was feeling quite ill too, now I feel even worse, and I'm going back to bed cos my head is spinning. Have a very nice holiday Jackie, to Tom and Nicki- See you 8am Sunday, to Max, um, hello?!

       I think Nicki is tired. Late last night I finished setting up wireless internet in my house. We can now access the internet from any room in the house, and even the garden. Study in quiet rooms, get latestest sport results while cooking and many other things - but does my mother do something that sensbile? No, of course not. "Wireless internet? Does that mean I can play computer games in bed?" Mothers hey? Tut tut. Blog more later, she's just got onto Level 2 of Lego "Stack It"...

       OK, so the times SHOULD be fixed now. Lol. I take it Max you cannot sleep still? Aww. How lovely. I have already send 6 texts this morning and it is only 10.15. Mwahahaha. I am so tired from Thorpe Park though. I really am. But I really enjoyed it. Simon is a wimp. Haha. I am tired. At least I won't be bored over the next 2 weeks as Jackie is very kindly giving me her dance mat while she is away. O how I love Jackie. I am tired. The park tomorrow better be fun or I just won't bother so someone better come and mess about and not just sit there for the whoooooole four hours. I am tired. O look, I just looked at my msn list and 6 people are online but I didn't even notice because my brain won't function properly today. I am tired. My cats are so funny. One is asleep in the chair and one is in a box. How cute. I am tired.

How much does a mouthpiece for the clarinet cost, Jo? Right, time to reformat and redo the whole of my network. I have 3 Windows XP OS's on this drive at the mo :D I got my Pot Noodle, now all I need is a biiiiiiiiiiig wank. Check out  urlLink Froogle . I wish they made one for the UK.

A friend is coming over today and we are having Keanu Film Day. Hehe. Should be a laugh. What can I ramble about? Um, well I am watcing Laurel and Hardy and they are really funny. I have already today text Sikon (at 12.08) gone to bed, got up, showered, eaten and cleaned my room. I am now posting here and surfing the web until 11 when I shall meet my friend.

       I do say stuff, but i never do anything exciting or out of the ordinary so i have nothing to write, but i try and write something every day so people know that im alive and that i havent dropped dead! Okay so lemme think of some news.... Well on www.faceparty.com/crisppy i am officially rated a supermodel now! I have been a star for the past like year! So im really really happy although i dont like being a supermodel that much! On Monday i am going to Croydon to get some passport photos done for stupid school, although i have no one to go with, that doesnt bother me though as im only getting the photos done then going home again! It's a bit of a trip but there aint any photo machines around where i live! Then tuesday im enroling and then after that i should be going to the cinema with Nicki to see Hollywood Homicide, that should be good but i do hope that Nicki doesnt talk too much or i may have to beat her with a wooden stick. On wednesday i have a frigging hospital appointment and then Thursday it's back to the dreadding school. ERm thats about it really! Thats my life all written down in one paragraph! :( lol

       You don't say much, do you Jackie? Today at work Trig brought with him his fly swatting gun, like Andy has. He then turned into James Bond and bounced around the centre swatting flies and scaring children. I came across a fake pound coin today! Never seen one before, and the customer hadn't either, he was quite suprised! Other than Garf and Biscuit's attempt at wearing womens jackets and Alex wearing winter-wet-suits it was a pretty normal day, or as normal as it can get.

Shrina and Shay are Alpa's kids, Kinnou and Kishan are Tina's kids, Kommel is Tina's niece and Bimmel is Tina's husband. I'm going to see Hollywood homicide t his avo with Paul! Yay! WE're going to the 5.40 viewing, just in case other people are thinking of coming today (probably not) but in case you do, I'll be there with Paul!

Shay behaves 10 times better t han Shrina, plus there is the added benefit that Shay can't talk yet, doesn't make you do strange dances, doesn't try and make u sing, doesn't push you into the window while you're trying to do a display, doesn't climb up ladders.................

       Brighton yesterday was fabulas. Ema and I had a great time and I managed to find a new pair of baggy surf jeans so yay! Day before I went to Croydon with mum to get stationary. We were just outside the bag shop on the second floor and Pennie came over, with her mum. And then Tom joined us, with his mum! Heehee. How fabulas. I got some pictures from Andy's party which are amusing.

       This would be much easier if the plane came to me, then I could get a few hours extra sleep, rather than getting up at stupid times in the morning. It's 5am for crying out loud!

       Nicki, you really need to get out more. Jackie, there is a part-time position being advertised in the window of Lloyds chemist in Hamsey Green- I think that means you do after school work and the odd Saturday or something, just thought I'd tell ya! Anywho, I haven't got much to do today, meeting Paul later this afternoon and he's coming here for  the evening. Other than that trying to get a bit of work done, but not getting very far.

       A tree toad loved a she-toad Who lived up in a tree. He was a two-toed tree toad But a three-toed toad was she. The two-toed tree toad tried to win The three-toed she-toad's heart, For the two-toed tree toad loved the ground That the three-toed tree toad trod. But the two-toed tree toad tried in vain. He couldn't please her whim. From her tree toad bower With her three-toed power The she-toad vetoed him.

       Evening. Great party last nite. (Of what I can remember). Sorry Tom, I couldnt do PWD on flashkit.com, I had sorta calmed down by the end of the night. I didnt throw up *cackle*. I didnt get one wink of sleep last night, and I did feel sick at about 6:30, so I took a Rennie in a desperate attempt to stop the sickness. It worked.

       Well yesterday I went to a party with some friends from Riddlesdown, but there defenition of party is more 'piss-up' than party. But anyway, it's really funny watching all theboys who get completely trashed then dance around madly to Electric Six and Led Zepplin. Extremely funny. I left about 11pm, but everybody else 'crashed' on the floor at Bennett's house over night, havign done a midnight raid on Tesco's with  "a spot of bush jumping", as Paul so delightfully put it. Anywho. Today I've been to Caterham and the library and stuff, got a supply of alchohol for Thursday (good or bad!), and got this wicked album out the library: "Ether Song" by Turin' Brakes, it's great! Also just discovering The Thrills and The Vines, they're pretty good tooooooooo! Thursday is drawing ever closer, trying to fill up my time to forget about it! I think I might take a trip into crodyon tomorrow to go to Beano's and get some more music, wander a bit, then I'm going to the cinema in the evening with Paul to see 'Pirates of the Carribean'. Yay! Tonight I am going out to a friend's house for a catch up, so no thinking about GCSEs! yay! Hmmmmmm! Just heard that Andy's party is hawaiin themed, so better go think about that one! ttyl guys!

       I went to Ikea today. My mother and I. I can not believe how long we waited for the stuff. All the larger stuff like wardrobes (what we were buying) has to be got for you via fork-lift-truck in the warehouse. 45 minutes we had to wait. 45 MINUTES! We left our trolleys, nothing had been paid for yet so we weren't worried, got in the car and went to Sainsburys. Got some food and a paper, went back, had a look at the art and pictures (I bought a picture of a rubber duck!) and then went back to the warehouse, read the paper for a few minutes and then finaly the stuff was given out. Not going back there for a while, at least a month.

        Welcome back Jo  I'd love to hear all about your holiday if you want to tell me about it. Yes thank you, I had a great time Cumbria. Thank you for remembering :) I'm not looking forward to Thursday either, I don't think our group is meeting up but I am sure we will all merge together when we are at the school. I haven't heard of any dinners or parties, or I haven't been invited. Guess I brought that on myself by not turning up to Daz's bbq. Oh my. How could I. I'm sorry but I am rather annoyed. People are a bit mad at me for not going. Fair enough. But how come its me they are mad at? How come when other people do the same thing its fine!? No getting annoyed at that person or whatever, just me. Grrr. I just can'tget it right can I? Perhaps I should disappear off the face of the earth and then perhaps people may miss me. Or maybe they will start to spread blame out rather than focus it on one person.  I understand that perhaps I have annoyed folk by talking about James, Jon, Leon and Ema alot but that is because  1) they are new and the novelty hasn't worn off yet 2) they don't place blame on me Its not everyone, only a few. But those few make me go all urgh and then I guess it can affect the ones who I love. If that makes sense. Yes I am in a badish mood. Why? Because my gorgeous new fabulas skate shoes decided that today when I walked up to Warlingham they were going to rip half the skin off my ankle which is not pleasant. I have also been shouted at 6 times today for the smallest things. So excuse me for having a moan.

       Hi guys! I'm back! Nice to know tom missed me, ha ha! Anyway! Did y ahave a good time Nicki? I should probbably read all the blogs that I've missed, but to be honest I'm too tired to faff around with it! Holiday was great, I'll tell you all individually if ya want to know instead of boring all of you who don't want to know, but the basis was it was great, 40 degrees everyday, blah blah! Yeah. Um. I'm not really looking forward to Thursday (obviuosly), but I am in the aspect that we get to see all our friends together again, various people have organised parties and dinners and stuff which should be good! I was wondering if our gang are meeting up somewhere and all going up to school together, or whether that will be too stressful for some people? Let me know if anyone has, and I shall be there! Well got to go, mein vater is cooking me an omlete! Tah tah!"

       Fair enough Tom. I always miss everyone when they are on holiday, the funny thing is no one misses me! Weather they are on holiday or if I am. I can prove that by the large number of people who had forgotten that I had been away for that week. How..demoralising. Made me feel great. Ok Jackie, I will see you there then. I am wandering to the park today to see Ema, James was coming but he can't now as he is getting as level results and so has to go home to tell his Aunt and Uncle. I miss Ema, I was on the phone to her for ages last night! Twas rather amusing.

       Interesting link there Tom. Thans for that. I certainly had a good old chuckle. Yer, Daz is very lucky with that. I think I can come to the BBQ but only for a couple hours as it is A-level day so I tink have to be home for dinner or something. I dunno. I'll see. Jackie, perhaps I can come to your house first or knock for you as I go up to Darrens? Or will you be there early to help him set up? My next few days are as follows: Tomorrow: A-Level result day so going to park to meet James to find out what he got at AS Level. Then Daz's bbq. Friday: Can't remember. Probably nothing. Saturday: Nowt. Sunday: Nowt.  Wooooooooooo!

       Well, i have been round Darens house all day helping him out in garden ready for his BBQ, i even helped to clean his room! He has sooooo much Alcohol! And his mum payed for it all! She is even paying for food and stuff as well! He is sooo lucky in that respect. I think we may be going to see T3 on Friday but i'm not sure, i will have to ask Max when i next speak to him. I hope we do, but if we don't i will ak Darren to go with me instead just the 2 of us, cause we have wanted to see it for ages! Tsk Tsk, you computer could be seriously ill Nicki! Make sure you take it to the Healthcheck at PC World or you could be in serious trouble! lol I am so glad that the heat is finally leaving us, its an acceptable heat now, i can sleep at night now without sweating the bed down! Lol, Has anyone got ne thing planned for the rest of the week? And Tom heres a virtual hug from me also! :D  Make sure you get another one from me off MSN.

       I am back. Yay. Our norton was corrupted and blocked us from accessing everything but it works again now. Although if I disappear for a while its probably because my computer is sick. We haven't taken it in for its yearly healthcheck at PCWorld like we are supposed to. Oops.  Sorry, I thought you saw T3 on Monday when I did, just earlier. I saw it in the evening. Yes, shocking, I was in Croydon at 8pm! OMG! But Leon, Ema and James waited with me until I got on the bus which was nice. Like I said, I like having people all protective over me. Its nice.  Awww Tom. Have a virtual hug. I know, life is a bitch sometimes and its not fair when people are taken from us. I don't know to say that can help except that I have you in my thoughts.

       Well my foot still hurts, and after tomorrows little trip I'm going to be flat broke. My spots are not being nice, I look like a bloody lepoard or something. Nothing I do helps! I take tablets, I apply funny strange blue liquid after washing, I wipe clean with those pad thingys when ever I come home, but fuck it! Nothing seems to work! I'm being selfish perhaps? Maybe I am, probably am, after all I'm selfish know-it-all twat, arn't I? I think I know everything and I never shut up, do I? Well you're going to put up with me for the next minute or two. Why should I have nice clear skin like everybody else? I don't need to be like everybody else, I'm not a bloody sheep or something. Yep, that's it, I'm a selfish bugger and proud of it. I want clear skin, I want this, and I want that. All me, me, me, me. Is it really so hard!?!? Bullshit there is some all mighty god or what ever the hell people believe in. If there was, stuff like this wouldn't happen. Victor, who is my great-grand-cousin (long title, but he's close), has been ill for a last month and has just passed away in hospital. He was such a nice person, had a lovely family who are now spread all over Europe (6 children!), and he wasn't even that old. Can't believe it, and I don't want to believe it. How can somebody so nice die? Much rather the people who broke into my neighbors house and stole their car died, that would be much nicer. Bastards, they should be shot. Makes me so angry that people think they can get away with it. People so desperate and stupid that they have to resort to crime to get them out of their problems. Go to hell the lot of 'em. So I'm selfish for wanting my family to live as well maybe? I want him back, I want to say goodbye. Is that selfish as well? It's not you, it's me. Ah, fuck it, it's all pointless anyway...

Its ok, I didn't like it all that much though. Camden yesterday was cool, I have never been before and I know I will be going there alot more often now. Hehe. I got a sum 41 hoodie for the winter. I like hoodies. They are so nice and waaaarm. I met Jon's twin yesterday. I really do look alike! I got a bit confuzzeled! I hope you are feeling better Tom and that the pain goes away soon!

       Awww bless yaz Tom. Well the park today shall be amusing what with the heat and poor air quality. I have a feeling it will be a case of just sitting there. I can't be assed to bring a rug today, takes too much effort carrying it up/down the hill.  I'm out tomorrow in London with my darlings. Hehe. Can't wait to see them all again. Even though I saw James yesterday. Argh. My brain can't handle the smog!

       On Thursday, Friday and today I've been doing Jo's job which is lots of fun. Still haven't quite got the hang of which order the garden pots go outside yet. I can take in the broom trolley without it going on the road. Tomorrow I'm doing my job (doing the afternoon shift, thank goodness). So I'm very tired, but I've just had a Reef on an empty stomach and seeing things in a new light, hehehe. Beep.

I may come down an hour or two latebecause I don't fancy wandering about at midday when its at its hottest. Hmm. I will decide tonight. Tom, you should be very impressed with me.

       You're not wrong Nicki, in America, it's the same movie, but it is rated R (people 17 and under require a parent or guadian to be present) because US censorship it rubbish. You can't show anything over there.

       One of my friends told me. Perhaps there are 2 versions because they do that sometimes. One is kinda uncut but I guess for the Terminator it would be total carnage. Who knows.

       Dammit Jackie! Why must you bring that up! LOL. Yer, good luck to you to. I am wetting myself about it. I think I will go up before 11 and be ready to get my results the moment they open up. I will then jump on my envelope, run home, open it, and cry. Yup. That's my plan. Nice pic of Nic Max. I don't think she'd be too impressed. Yesterday I had one of my group meetings, it was great. Lovely to see everyone again. Today is our last meeting so I am not too pleased but I am happy because Ema has invited me to a party and James and I have spoken on the phone for nearly 2 hours every night so far since we have been back. They love me! LOL.  I am in a bit of dilemma but that is something to be spoken about quietly.    HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY JENNY

       Have fun Jo! The Lake District is so much fun and camping up there is even better :) I am sure you will have a great time. I did when I went. Yes, the film was excellent, I too would like a sequal and I would like to be a vampire. I already have the eyes. Mwhahaha. 3 weeks at Sixth Form. Good bad? I'd say good. Its going well for me. I am really knackered this week from sixth form and work. Whenever I stay up late doing homework or something I have to get up early and never get a chance for a lay in. Right now I am aching so bad. :(  Have a nice weekend everyone.

       Well. What an interesting day. Had to take half my personal belongings into school today to pack into a barrell for D of E, and I just know I'm going to have forgotten to pack something really crucial. As it is I've forgotten plates and cuttlery (quite important!), so i'm gonna have to sit on it tomorrow in the mini-bus. So yes. I just hope that a) it doesn't rain, and b) it doesn't get too bloody cold!!! I think that the cold is going to be the worst bit, having to camp for 3 nights in the freezing cold lake district, with nothing but 5 layers of clothes, a sleeping bag and a lilo for warmth. Hey ho, gotta do these thigns to get places in this world, I guess! Sholud be a laugh though, I just can't help feeling a bit nervous cos we've got to capsize in the lake, and I hate deep water. However, we do get life jackets so it sholudn't be too scary................But I bet I end up in tears whatever happens! Hey ho, so gutys have a good weekend, be back on Tuesday! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

I enjoyed the chat Jackie, Sally, Matt and I had fourth lesson. It was just plain cute I reckons. Today was ok. Lessons were good. Art was hilarious as we had to draw ourselves with a continuous line without looking which was incredibly amusing. It rained! Wahoo! My cous sent some pictures of him and his wife from this wedding then went to. It was in Montanna and the pics are so nice. I'm happy. I'm content with my life. Its fine.

BUSTED were so awesome. I love BUSTED. I would go see them next year at Wembley but tickets are like £21.50 which is a bit stepp so I will just enter lots of competitions and see if I get in there that way, cos BUSTED are worth it. Oh the park. Yer. Haven't spoken to them yet. Who went in the end do we know? Yer so BUSTED were great and I love Matt Jay now, aka, MATTIE. Phor. Wahey. Start work tomorrow. Don't know when I am working yet so I don't want any of ya'll coming in trying to harass me on my first day. But you can come in to say hi if you wish. LOL.

So yeah. Today has been one whirl-wind of a day, in all aspects. Busy, busy, what with Ofsted Inspectors lurking in corridors and stuff, plus I am trying to work out with my head of 6th form what to take up instead of geography, or whether to bother at all, so I've just phoned about 20 different unis to ask their advice, and I got to go and have a meeting with Mr Butterworth tomorrow morning to dicuss more.

Worst lesson i sprobably psychology cause ms Ajit is a stupid woman who continually writes stuff on the borad and it gets kinda boring after like 10 mins! I woul agree with nicki bout the free periods but only cause u can laugh at peeps in lessons! i am quite anoyed that i only got 8 frees now rather than the 14 i started with! lol Worst thing bout 6th form is the ammount of work you get, i think it is unbeleivable you get sooooooo much.

       Ahhhhhhhh. Eat you aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive. Omg how annoying was that whole music argument earlier. I can't believe how rude the sixth form are, especially the upper sixth. They are supposed to be helping and welcoming us not attacking us!!!!! But anyway, we will get our way eventually. I had a goodish day today. Lessons were fine. Here is a small question thingy for everyone to do:  1) Best lesson/subject? Why? 2) Worst? 3) Best thing about Sixth Form? 4) Worst?  My anwsers: 1) Geology because we have such a laugh with Seward. For example I wore my top with the sticky letters and we wrote 'seward.com'. Then changed it to 'seward rocks' (get the joke there..geology...rocks) which was highly amusing. Then using seward rocks we were finding the anagrams of it. LOL.  2) Probably English with that lady teacher I have. Its boring. We all fall asleep. 3) Free periods. You can chill out in common room, go on computers, do work in libary, go to shops, do schol service. Its so cool because most others are in lessons. 4) The upper sixth being prats and not seeing people as much like Jackie.

       Congratulations Jo :)  I agree Jackie. I disagree with Max. I would say something to Sheepy by he hasn't blogged in a while. Lol. Well I came online last night at 11.10PM. Shocking. I had been doing art and textiles since 8pm so I wanted a break. After I came offline at about 11.45PM I did a couple spider diagrams and then went to be. Got up at 8 this morning, added some more detail to all my 4 spider diagrams and then came on here. In a mo I will go and do my geology and english lit (essay and book talk prep!!) and then go off to Woolies for my job interview. O the excitment. Then of course tomorrow I am going to the CBBC Prom In The Park with Jo, Tom and Nancy which should be a laugh. Then its back to school, week one, school service, lessons, mad lunches, free periods, general studies (pah!).

I have read everyones blog since my last but I won't comment on them all as I can't remember what they all said!!  So far I am finding Sixth Form mang! There are only one or two aspects I am not liking but thats mainly teachers I'm not keen on. I love all the new folk we have in our ickle group. Jenni, JAMES....lol. Hush. I am looking forward to the geology trip we are organising for half term. We get 2 days off school which means we also get to miss the sponsered walk!!! Yea!!!  September 11th. R.I.P.

(i did leave 2 peices form yesterday to do today) Erm that phot thing is stupid and took age, my legs were acheing after that, and boy my picture is gonna look like shit! Erm i would like to say Miss Shar is usless, she talks on bout nothing so we dont get any of the info we are ment to get and we always end up walking out of the classroom with her still yabbering on bout nothing! I had four frigging lessons today, i think General studies is gonna be a load of bollocks, if id wanted to take 5 subjects i woulda done! No one said nothing bout doing general studies wen we applied did they! Grrrrrrrr What a bloddy waste of time! And not to mention energy, i do hope we dont get homeowrk for that cause i got enuf already, that probably being cause i got a bout 13 teachers and im only doing 3 subjects! Which means with every teacher i get homework, but fortuantly it means that it doesnt have to be in for ages cause i dont have then again for like a week! I now how 3 fat text books to carry to skool everyday and not to mention the 3 folders i also have to bring to skool with all my work in, by the end of the year im gona have no arms left cause they will of dropped off! Wahey this is a long blog for me, i think its cause im in a  oaning mood and im taking a break form teh 4th peice of homework of the nite! I'm not used to this, back in the good ole days of yr 11 i could leave it till the last minute and srill have to time to eat a cake! But not now as each peice takes like an hour or more to do! I Cant cope and im saying this after only  4 days at school! lol Im sure ill ajust to the lifestyle, it sounds better than urs Jo, you seen to have mountains of homwork and hardly ne free periods! Mine have gone done to 11 now cause of stu[id general studies! I would like to apoliguise for my poor spelling and grammar but i cant be bothered to check through it and make sure it makes sence! Hehe im lazy! Well thats bout it from me, im off to continue my Health and Social Care homework in which i have to read a newspaper and then rite about it and challenge its contents!

Throwing grapes at Tom and Dave, that was good as well. (It was Jenny.J who through the grape at Jenny - Tom I swear, lol!!!!). WHEY! only had 1 lesson today total, including the cancelled ICT lesson. SCHIZER. I havent done my ICT, maybe because I cant think of a project to do.

Well I've been working since I got home about 3.15 today, I literally finished 10 minutes ago, I've washed my hair, running a bath, going to dry my hair, then go online to chat to people until I feel that the time has come for me to retire to bed!  WEll today for homework I have had to write a piece on why Mussolini came to power, make notes on a chapter of geography on urbanisation, Research and do a piece on tides, learn the present tense in Spanish (regular an irregular), Do some french questions on a text then translate the whole of the text into English, 4 questions on Algorithms for Decision maths, and finally a whole exercise on manipulating surds (in the words of my teacher, "sounds vaguely obscene") for pure maths. Oh the joys! Well at least I am enjoying it atm!

       Good Jackie - you get to read a real newspaper rather than just rubbish about people who show off for a living, anyway... I'm tired. Way too much work. I can't believe it, a few years ago I stopped art, I thought that was the end of my colouring in days - but oh no, geography today, drawing maps. Green for land, blue for sea - logical you see. One step ahead of the game. Business & Economics as well, stuff about the shop Spar (private joke for Jo, SPPAAARRRRRRRRR!). More geography for the other one, Coombes. First media studies lesson today - very cool, looks like fun! Period 5 today quite a few people had a free and not many could be bothered to do any work at the end of the day, so sat in the common room. Tasha was having a conversation with Penny and Helen, and the whole room went quiet for some reason (you know what I mean, it just does) and all you could hear was Tasha saying "are we talking testicals?" Rather amusing I must say. Have you guys seen that stupid sign the upper sixth put up about us? First day in school and instantly we get blammed for the mess in the common room. No lower sixth went in the common room because they were all to scared of the upper sixth! Silly people. I think it's quite sweet the way the whole room has divided itself between upper and lower, straight down the middle. Poor Nicki still hasn't got her computer working yet, so she's probably reading this in school at lunch - hi Nicki!

Um yes. Well school is ok actually, I have a group of people I could call 'friends', probably more associates, but hey, I got to start somwhere. I'm still getting the 'oh let's all talk to the new girl and try to drag her into our clan' which isn't too bad, as everywhere I go people talk to me and yell hi across the corridors and stuff, which makes me feel liked so all's good atm.

       Food for poor ol' me as well!!!!! Yesterday was absolutely great. Not only did I get £30 for doing 5 mins maintenance/repair on someones PC, but I had a great night out too! Can't get any better than that. As my wallet has been 'topped-up' *smug* I can now afford my Only Fools And Horses DVD, Max Payne II (when it comes out in about a month) and I can also take Nic out for a classy meal when I get round to it one weekend. Corny. I have also done most of my homework so far. I'm hardly lagging which gets me in a happier mood :) P.S: BRAND new absolutemaxpayne.co.uk due for release in about 3 weeks (just before release, how convenient). Kinky.

       Oh dear. As some of you know I went to the BFI London IMAX cinema yesterday with Dave, Andy and Max to see The Matrix Reloaded. The movie was great! But, rather than finishing at about 9pm like we thought it would, it finished at 11pm. So after getting out of the cinema, into the station, getting some food for poor Andy, finding a train, then hanging around at Clapham Junction for 20 minutes to get to East Croydon I got home pretty close to 1am. If I fall asleep in the common room, just poke me or something.

       Well done Jackie. Can't believe the little amount of frees you have Jo. I have 14 I think. In fact period one tomorrow is free. Yay, Monday morning and I can sleep for an hour in the common room! I was not impressed on Friday. My Eng Lit lesson was crap, I nearly fell asleep. Its one of those teachers who talks in the same flat tones. AAAAAAH! Then I had a free so I did some school service. Then I had textiles which at the moment I hate. The teacher was treating uslike year 7's, don't talk when I am, don't talk you should be doing your work etc... She also said that when we bring in fabric we HAVE to share it, like if someone asks to use some of yours you give it to them. Nope. I'm not. I don't have much money so anything I buy I am using myself, they can go buy it themselves. I mean for textiles and art so far its already cost me £10 for the 4 sketch books. Outrageous. I don't see why I should supply the rest of the class with fabric.  Anyways, I still have one more piece of textiles to do so chal.

Hey ho, at least I'm enjoying school and I am making friends, I've even been invited to someone's birthday party- and she's only invited 25 people. I guess it's out of pity for the poor new girl, but hey! Who am I to complain?!! Got to get my costume sorted for that, but she's gonna tell me what the theme is on monday. Shoudl be interesting........ My other bit of news is that I'm going to audition for Cabaret with Chloe on Monday night! That should be an absolute hoot. I can't remember whether I said that yesterday or not, but tbh I am so tired I really can't remmeber! hey ho. Got all my files sorted, so I'm ready to be off Monday morning and straight into a full week! Fortunately I only have to carry a daily file as we're not allowed to take in our whole file for each subject, in case we lose it somewhere and then we'll basically fail our AS levels wihtout the notes, apparently. Anyway! That's about it for today, I shall give u an update as to whether I am going on the Gold D of E canoeing expedition in a few weeks time when I find out on Monday- Holly and I are going to bribe the leader into letting me join in!

       Glad you had a good day Jo and that you are making friends :) I agree with Jackie, wasn't worth £20, maybe £10 but not £20. I enjoyed yesterday, I thought that the purpose of it all did work. I know my form seem a lot more relaxed with each other. My tutor is Miss Wilkins. Great. I have in my form who I know and get along with well, Olly, Max, Matt (can't remember his second name) and Lee Reeves. Then there are Michelle and Lisa who obviously I know and all. It should be okay. I also have Charlie in my form and he is a good laugh so should work out fine. I can't see how the Sixth Form block will work at lunch what with the lower and upper sixth all in at once. That's gonna be crazy. New guy James, was a bit lost at lunch as he couldn't find people so I told him to come on over and eat with us. Then Tom took him and the new girl Jenny off to the shops. Bless them. Bless Tom.

       Today I had tutor this morning where some interesting discussions took place between a girl called Chloe and I- she was telling me all about her day at the REAding festival, each band that played in the main arena, which guys she fancies from various punk/rock bands, and all abotu her favourite george Orwell novels, aparently the best she has read was a crime solving thing from the point of view of a cat....... Anyway, she was quite cool and I ended up on duty with her at break time, guarding the main hall from little kiddies trying to vandalise anythign and everything. Turns out she doesn't like anyone else in our tutor group either, so I tink it's a safe bet that i'll be spending a lot of time with her in tutor activities. After lunch I had a geography lesson which was a bit boring but also quite bizarre- the teacher sat us down and explained the usual boring stuff, then said "here's the book cupboard, here's some paper, do something with it" and we were all kind like, 'uh???!' but then she said she wanted us to write notes around the subject of coast lines, ready for our field work trip which is like 4 weeks time! argh! That's then going to be our coursework which has to be done by 5th Novemeber, so it's all getting quite scary already! I also made a sort of buddy in geography called Amy, we shared the books around and helped each other out by swapping notes! how sad am I? I'm jsut desperate to make friends I guess! Anywho, last thing I had french and that was quite funny actually,the teacher I had today is like Mrs Mawer (Jackie will know!), but and english version and slightly less barmy. That was ok! According to Chloe and Garfunkel (? Who knows what his real name is, but Chloe called him Garfunkel) I have a good set of teachers, which includes the head of sixth form and the deputy head, both of which are quite cool. i've also been pursuaded to audition for the school production on Monday night....... CABARET! One MOnday night we all have to go along for 2 hours where we will be taught for a song and dance routine, and then we'll  havbe to go back on Wednesday and actually do the audition to a panel of, um, teachers I guess! Nayway should be a laugh and the 6th form always get heavily involved (so I am assured by various upper 6th and school council members), so what the hell? I'm going along with Chloe and her friends, so should be a laugh if that;s all. Looking forward to tomorrow, Chloe has promised to bring me in her Placebo albums for me to borrow..............

Got chatting to quite a few people about things, generally it's cool and my tutor is nice, in all aspects!! ;) Anyway! Not got much else to say really. Tah tah

       Nope, not yet, we find that out on our fun team building day on Thursday. We pay 20 quid to do fun team games and meet new friends. Well you know what? I don't want to know anybody else, the friends I have a lovely and the rest of our year are a bunch of twats. 200 of us paying £20 for one days 'fun' - you do the maths.

       lol fair enough! I've got a bit of a problem in that on my student card I've got one of the photos that we got done on the last day of school, and I'm in me warlingham uniform. That means everytime I have to show the damned thing on the train I'm probably gonna get mobbed by Oxted kids. It's weird thinking Oxted'#s my school now, and Warlingham's a thing of the past!

       I agree Tom. The odd fancy dress party like Andy sometimes has is fun and amusing because that is all it is, fancy dress and a party.  But anyway, if your trick or treating don't bother coming to my house because we never open our door to any person silly enough to knock on complete strangers houses.   I got back from Birmingham yesterday. It was cool. The uni is right in teh city centre so a five minute walk and there is the train station and many a shop. HUGE shopping centres there. I got some new clothes but I've run out of room so I need hangers and I need more drawers. Sorry about not blogging Jackie, I haven't had time. Harass Max. He hasn't said a word yet about Max Payne 2.

       I hate Halloween. It has strange routes that nobody is quite sure about, it's a bit of a famine in the 1840s in New England, USA. It's a bit of the Irish about a man called Jack who made a deal with the devil, making the Jack-o-lantern - used to be in a turnip but the USA decided it would be better to use pumpkins as there were more of them. Trick-or-treating comes from Celts and was actually to give food to the needy on 2nd November in return for giving prayers to the dead on their path to heaven. It is the Celtic New Year as the summer officaly ends, acording to the Celts in 5 BC. There really isn't much in it at all. I'm sorry to be the evil and unsprited one, but I refuse to be sucked into this. Children running around wearing stupid masks  threatening  people to give them sweets which are going to make them fat. Old people have a terrible time and every year you read about an old lady somewhere going to hospital or having her house attacked. I don't care how great it is to dress up and run around looking silly, you can do that any day of the week in my house and get away with it, come on round, it will be a ball.

Ere you are Jackiemus: 1. 1 a year 2. 1  3. 30  4. 5  5. No idea  6. Half in each. Or right on the border. It it depends where the plane was from like it may have been Brittish Airways or something. 7. gas  8. An uncle. Or Stepdad. or Family friend. 9. what 10. because our brains are dumb and are not photographic enough 11. what are you on about 12. 9 13. lonely. keanu no. its, aaaaaaaaaaaah! I have no bloody idea! 14. inside blaines head  15. how are you.  Right now all I have to say is: life can keanu off and keanu annoy some other poor keanu soul.

       Concorde stops flying on Friday :(  Nicki got Picture 2 correct first (probably because she sent the e-mail at 7:30am that day) Max got both the pictures correct, but Picture 2 after Nicki. Jo bot both of them correct, but 1 day and 1 hour after Max. So Nicki gets a hug, Max gets 10p (unless he really wants a hug) and Jo gets a smile.

       Well Today I was approached by a neighbor ova the road asking whether I could babysit on a Monday night her two kids from bout 8ish till 10ish for a fiver as she goes to a keepfit class, now of course I said yes as it means I get a fiver for doing nothing as both kids will be in bed! Yay. I can watch T.V, do my homework or ne thing really! So it means I wont be on Msn much on a Monday any more cause I wont have time! Also I will find out on Wednesday whether I will have a job, hopefully I will cause I need some money! I am also enjoying Karate at the moment as its really good, although it does leaves you with aching legs for a couple of days after cause they make you do stretching for like 10 mins and it really hurts! But now I can touch my toes and before I went I couldn't touch them, so at least I have learnt something. I will also be starting my first Kata, this is the moves I need to pass for yellow belt, which I will be taking in something like 3 months! Yay Trampolining is also going well, I am starting to learn how to do a backwards somersault as I can now do a front somersault and a front piked somersault! My sister was home again this weekend from Uni, although she didn't spend much of it actually at home, she was out with her mates for most of the time! I think she spent apporx 3 hours actually at home not including sleeping! LOL unfortunately she has to leave at like 3 on a Sunday cause it takes like 5 or 6 hours to get back, this time she was getting driven back so she didn't have to get a number of trains and buses! I am looking forward to the sponsored walk, i don't know why as I'm gonna be knackered afterwards as I'm actually walking the thing instead of helping out! Oh yea does anyone want to sponsor me? You don't have to cause i already got a few but you can if you want to. HEHE

       (These are me trying to do the dullest blogs possible)  Earlier today I was sittiing on a chair. I stood up but felt a little dizzy. I sat down. I stood up again and put on my bag. I took a step forward onto my right foot. I stopped and picked up my jacket. I carried on walking. I went outside. It felt chilly. I took off my bag. I put on my jacket. I was warmer. I carried on walking.

       I wanted to make a drink. I went into the kitchen and I picked up a mug. I put four heaped spoons of hot chocolate powder into the mug. I filled the kettle with water. I put some milk into my mug. I stirred the milk in with the powder until it was a chocolate goo. I waited for the water to boil. I poured the water into the mug. I stirred it up. I took a sip. It burnt my lip. I waited for it to cool. When it was cool I drunk some more. It was nice.

       Nicki was the first to win, so she gets to choose a hug/10 pence/take me out to dinner. Jo got it second, so she gets the runners up prize, a smile. :)  Name the object srounded in white.    What is curently on the white/black dot? It's an old photograph, so the buildings around it have changed.    Do not post your ideas on El-Bloggo! Send them to me via e-mail to my normal address. You can now edit and change dates and times on El-Bloggo, plus you might give others ideas!  Not sure how easy/hard you'll find those. If you get both of them you win a massive hug/20 pence/take me out to dinner. If you get one of them correct you win a medium sized hug/15 pence/take me out to dinner. If you get close on both/either of them you get a normal hug/10 pence/take me out to dinner. If you have no idea then you get a look of disapointment/-10 pence (you give me money)/take me out to lunch (not quite as good as dinner).  Good luck! I get back Thursday late afternoon. Bye bye.

       If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd worked for all my life, And I had to start again with just my children and my wife, I'd thank my lucky stars to be living here today, 'Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that away.    I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free, And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me, And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.   From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee, Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea. From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A., There's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say:   I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free, And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me, And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.

That is good because I get paid overtime and its extra because its a Sunday. Btw Jackie, Pam was asking Lora about you. My day was fine. Right now I am not impressed as I am cold, I burnt my pizza again and I have just been attacked by a huge spider and now I am kinda depressed at James, Jon and Leon because I don't liek people hating me or hating me for no reason. Argh.

WEnt home, packed my bags, went to Hollie's house, we all got merry, all crashed on her 'playroom' floor, woke up about 10am, came home, got dressed, sitting here freezing my butt off. I hate my bum.

       James, Jon and Leon are those 'freinds'. I don't even know why, they are being silly. I haven't done or said anything to annoy them and thats the truth, I have torn it all apart trying to see what I did which has made them hate me but I haven't done anything. Whatever the problem is its theirs and I can't be bothered with them anymore if they are going to be silly. As I said, I am not that upset with it because I have you guys and you are what is important. Tom, glad its all working out for you! Yay! Max, Jo - BLOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL.

       School is much better now. I've switched from doing AS Business & Economics to AVCE Business Studies. The main difference is the AS concenrates on the whys of thing, why does the economy work like it does, how does demand and supply work and things that happen right around the world. The AVCE is much more how a business works (as opose to how the world works), so it includes human resources, marketing and general business stuff - something which I'm finding much easier and will probably be more use to me in the long run. Unfortunatly I've had to drop Geography because of that (blocks don't fit) which is a shame - but you can't have it all can you! My NUS card arrived yesterday, and my Driving Licence arrived today! Yay! Hehe.

       What survey? Well I am pissed off with the Sixth Form only because that the party they have organised for us is located at a club/bar we aren't even allowed in so that is gay and pointless. Other than that I am still enjoying Sixth Form. I thinks its fab. Over the past week I have lost 3, what I thought were close, friends but I am not too bothered as I have gained loads more and I still of course have you fabulas guys! Oh THAT survey.

       This guy walks into a bar, pulls out a tiny piano, stool, and a tiny little man. The tiny man sits down, and starts to play the piano. This other guy notices it. "Hey, what's that?" "A twelve-inch pianist. You see, I found this magic lamp, rubbed it, made a wish, I got a twelve inch pianist." "Can I try?" The man with the piano agrees and a minute later, a million ducks fill the room. "Ducks? I didn't wish for a million ducks, I wished for a million bucks!" "You think I really wished for a twelve inch pianist?"

Jackie - the batik has come out really well, the colours are sooooo nice!!!! Max - paintballing......wooooooooo! Tom - baa. bleep.  Ok so I had an argument with James from Cumbria trip last night, I don't know if we are speaking now or not but I'm not as bothered now that my friends have grown with new folk and like the grunger lot. Its not too bad. I have found out that on Saturday - and probably Sunday - I will be working at Woolies from 8.30AM to 5.30PM (or later). Argh!!!!! I will be so tired on Monday.

       Oh. Right. Okay then. Glad you had a nice evening.  I would've been there but of course when tickets were purchased I was forgotten about which I'm still slightly annoyed about but oh well. I'm used to it so never mind.  Interesting day at work yesterday. Spent all day on stock room with Dean. Very amusing. He bailed on me for Wednesday though, he forgot he has to work so I only get him for like an hour and you can't see a film in an hour so now I'm gonna see if Rudders wants to come. Did have an idea for Wednesday which I was going to put forward to you Tom but it doesn't matter now seeing as you seem to be in London all the time and I'm sure if my plan work it would turn into another day going anywhere but the place I wanted. Or maybe we'd end up somewhere I didn't have aticket. Oh I don't know. Doesn't matter now.  If Rudders doesn't wanna come to cinema then I guess I'll be at home all day. Wahey. Even though I have tonnes of xmas shopping to you.  I have to go to work. I really don't want to today, I feel too bad and I think I will ask Pam if I can come home if it isn't too busy and there are enough people working. Got my pay. £160. Less than last time but I lost £30 when I was away for the geology trip. Ah well. What is money?   Glad we won. We are the rugby world champions. Yay us. God bless you Johnny.

All-American Rejects, London Astoria. Yay, that was brilliant. Fantastic place, didn't get squished, great music, nice venue, lovely to see Jo again with her super-cool short hair. They finished with The Last Song, and the stupid things is I joked about that before we went in. A couple of them had Union flag thongs, which was, um, nice? One of the support bands where a bit nutty, especialy the guy on the keyboard, he was bouncing around like a headless chicken. Funny though. Many more people crowd surfing than at Enanesence, but not quite as voilent. One guy got on the stage and started worshiping the second support band. So all in all a very pleasent evening, thanks Jo!

You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell.

I think some of Jacko's music is ok, even good but as a person he is very very strange.  Bush has gone home today. Hope he enjoyed his pub lunch. Media have been attacked in Baghdad. Wopee. The war is upon us again.  I'm still feeling ill. Headache and stuffy nose now. I didn't leave school until 3pm which was pretty dumb seeing as we had an early closure and I had fourth free so I could've gone home at 1.30. Oh well. Work at 9am tomorrow. Yay.

       First Level of Hell - Limbo  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Charon ushers you across the river Acheron, and you find yourself upon the brink of grief's abysmal valley. You are in Limbo, a place of sorrow without torment. You encounter a seven-walled castle, and within those walls you find rolling fresh meadows illuminated by the light of reason, whereabout many shades dwell. These are the virtuous pagans, the great philosophers and authors, unbaptised children, and others unfit to enter the kingdom of heaven. You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad.

Thats my first lay in since I started work at Woolies! Today I tried to do some work but my brain wouldn't concentrate and I ended up either sleeping or watching Lord Of the Rings. I didn't go on the comp once! Not until now so i must be ill! LOL. Hoep I didn't miss much, hope ya'll had a better day than I!!!!

        I'm too stupid to eat a Kit-Kat.   I'm pissed off, this is PC or what ever gone way to far. On my Kit-Kat that I have just eaten it did not have Kit-Kat written on it, but on one bar “break” and the other “here”. My chocolate has ingraved into it instructions on how to eat it. What else I'm I going to bloody well do with it? It's a fucking Kit-Kat, you break it down the middle, that's why it's there, that's why it has that massive line, everybody knows that and if they don't they are too bloody stupid to read!  Unfortunatly I can't boycott Nestlé otherwise I'll have nothing to eat in the mornings (Shreddies, ummmm). But I'm boycotting Kit-Kat, along with McDonalds, Burger King and the Heathrow Express.

       Yeah. Go Nicki. I am working 10 till 6 tomorrow, and 10.30 to 2.30 on Sunday. Whoppee. But at least I get £83, and it still leaves me with time to do work. Yeah, That's the life.  Not much else really, apart from when I was doing duties yeterday there was about 200 kids swarming, it was blatanlty obvious that something was happening, but what did we do? nothing. We decided it looked too scary and they were taller than us, so we just watched. Then teachers of all shapes and sizes started running after them, shouting and yelling at them and each other. It later aspired that there was some kinda major fight and then two other serious isolated incidents, and we did nothing. Makes me feel quite guilty really. Hey ho, life goes on.

       Come on folks. Lets hear about you and your week or your day.  My week has been strange. Very stressful, very tiring. Had to work again last night, shut myself in a cage by accident while taking cages out to lorry. Erm...what else?? Textiles is going good. Geology still sucks but Seward is helping me a bit more now. I had a chat with him and at least we know where the other one stands. Scottie-doo is talking to me again even though I still don't know why he wasn't in the first place. But hey, hes back at least. Erm...what else. Yea Jackie brought me some mice earlier from Woolies. I ate them. I have to work tomorrow 8.30 - 6.00. Great. Oh well. I get to see Dean haven't seen him in a while.

       I spoke to Carvell today. She is going to leave Seward a note and she said she'll sit in on a lesson next week. I'm not sure entirely why, maybe to see how I am in lessons or how Seward reacts to me asking for help? I'm not sure. I just hope it will work. Actually thinking about it now I hope I haven't got Seward into trouble.  Shit. I've just messed everything up now haven't I? Omgomgomgomg. Why can't everything be simple??? Ok I better go now and sort my head out cos its just got incredibly full of random confused thoughts again like Friday.

       Ok Nicki. I don't know fi I'm coming back on tonight cos I've been out all day today, and I have a little bit of work to do tonight. Fortuantely I don't have alot to do, otherwise I would be stuffed.  I have till training at 5pm tomorrow, I hope it all goes ok and I don't end up looking too stupid! Anyway. I got my lovelly fleece and my name badge yesterday, I haven't got my trousers and my shirts yet, so at the moment I have to wear my own black trousers, a whiote shirt, and keep my jacket done up, lol. Fair enough. Anyway, I really should go and do some work now because I should. Otherwise I'll feel vyer bad. My bargain buy for the day was 3 paris of tights from Primark in Bromely- red, blue and turqoise- £1 each. To go with my bargain boots and my bargian skirt. Wahey. I'm strange. Whatever. See y'all later guys. Bye

       Well the art trip is to Barcelona for a week. I think its the begining or March. My summer will consist of me working at Woolies if I still have a job. No park, no bowling. Just work. Pah. That blog about me feeling happier - lies! All lies! I need to speak to Madame Carvell on monday, Pennie has ordered me to. She said that I really need to go tell someone. I guess it makes sense. I don't want to spend every lunch time like I did on Friday. :(

Thinking of doing the IMAX for my birthday but not sure at the moment. What do you think? After the film (you'll all be proud of me for this! I am!!!) I went into the leather shop and asked them about the Matrix Reloaded jacket they have in the window. He let me try it on! Woooooooooooo! And it suited me! Honest it did! I WILL be saving up for it. Trust me. I'm going to Spain on the art trip. Wahoo!

       Yeah that's very true. Good point. With my politics lessons we watched this thing called "Mark Thomas: Debt Collector" and what I heard was appauling. Loads of big corporations like HSBC and other ones that lent money to Saddam's regime and sold him weapons worth millions, now he's gone they're demanding their money back. Iraq's debt is something like £30 billion and is going up all the time due to interest. HSBC are demaning something like £200 million back from Iraq, which puts like a £12,000 debt on the head of every Iraqi- money they simply don't have and can't get. I thought that was really rude an absolutely ridiculous, but this program was really eye-opening.  Anyway, enough of that, but I am finding politics really interesting now I actually understand about it! Shut up Jo. Go do something useful.

       There is something else I would like to bitch about. Attitudes to war. People are still slagging off Iraq and our involvment as well as Americas. I can see why people are so against it but I wish people would just give it up and give their soliders the support they deserve. I sat here and listened to someone go on and on about the mess we've made well we haven't! We've taken away the rules and are trying to put in place new ones will are more beneficial to the country. GAH.

       I agree with Jackie again. Except that I don't drink alcohol mainly because the stuff I do drink is never at the parties we go to. I am what some of my sisters uni mates call a 'mature drinker' because I drink stuff like JD and Coke or champagne. I don't like the cheaper alcopops and things. I can see why Jackie drinks and I think teh way she drinks is fine. She has a few but never enough to make her tipsy or anything more. I don't have a problem with people like that I just don't like folk getting drunk because its just plain stupid. Back to the example of Andy - missed his own party. Jenny at his party, threw up everywhere and probably felt like shit the next day liek most who got pissed. Its dumb. You can't remember it so whats the point in even going? Our leavers ball - it was mainly the popular or tarty lot that were drunk, they can't remember half of it. Our lot: no alcohol, just high on the buzz of the evening and we can remember every precious moment. Glad Dave's party was good. I spent the evening doing bloody homework because I was given way to much to do. I mean its half term for goodness sake, its a holiday. We should be relaxing, getting our systems back to their full potential not running them down further by working. Its not even as if I actually went away on holiday. I spent a few days on the geology trip which was doing geology work so that is fair enough, then two days with my sister at her uni who I haven't seen since she went which again is fair enough. I think family comes before college. I wouldn't be suprised if I told the teachers 'I haven't had time to do the work because I was in hospital after being a car accident' and even if it was true they would still yell at me.  I am sick of life right now. I mean is it really worth all this? All this stress over a few pieces of work, the stress of earning enough money, the stress of knowing what you want to do in life and who you want to be with. Its too much and soon its gonna get me. As Spike says:  From Beneath You It Devours

       Nicki - I wasn't having a go, anyway if you want me to, I will, so here goes....  MAX PAYNE 2 IS THE BEST GAME EVAR!!!  There aint really much to say except its bloody brilliant.  Yup, and Dave.D's party was kewl, Andy kept chucking stuff up this girl's skirt and Rob was dancing quite happily with this pissed girl. At the end of the party, Lee phoned his house to ask if his parents could pick him up. Okay, so when his parents didnt turn up half an hour later, we dropped him back home. He lived literally 30 seconds walk from Dave's house. *Hits head hard on table*.

       Yes i happily drink alcohol, but i have never drunk more than 3 bottles in one night, i have never got drunk and if there is no alcohol then i dont give a flying fuck. And from knowing my sister and her friends and half of the school most peeps are not like me, ask most peeps and there idea of a good night is going out and getting drunk so that they dont remeber a thing that happened! For me thats just sad? Why bother going out at all if your not gonna remebr ne of it? I'd rather go out and have no alcohol and be with my mates all night long! Just think Andy missed his own party cause he went over the top with alcohol.  Alcohol is just another thing for the government to make money on. In fact i dont even like the taste of most alcohol the only reason ireally drink it is to fit in, if i go to a party and everyone is drink ing then i will do it or peeps say- "omg your sad, how can you not drink? your 16 not 6" I find dat quite annoying so i drink. I'm just glad im sensible not to drink to much to end up throwing all over the place! And just to let you know I'm feeling kinda stressed so if that sounds rude... Then it IS!

       I agree with Jackie about the alcohol. You see what kinda of trouble sixteen year olds do get into and then eighteen year olds. Its pretty outrageous. And TOm I don't think Jackie is being hypocritical because yes she does drink quite happily at parties but she doesn't go out of her way to get drunk like Pennie and Helen. Jackie is one of these people where if there is alcohol she will have some, not loads, some. If there isn't then fine. It doesn't matter. I think? Jackie? Max - you never told me that. You haven't exactly blogged all aboutit like you usually do going on and on about the graphics etc..  You know how everyone seems to have 2 lines. One line is simple to get to, it can be crossed by something hurtful or by general stress. The second line is harder and when you get to it thats when you seriously start to think about things, life, people. Is it really worth it? I'm nearing that second line rapidly. I can't handle the amount of work I have. I don't have the time. I can't work any harder than I am now.

       Well I had a very sleepless night last night. I didn't go to Dave's party because I had way too much work to do so yesterday afternoon / evening I sat upstairs and did my art and as much of my textiles as I can (bearing in mind the machine I borrowed from school broke, helpful). I think I had like a 40 minute break when I was the phone to Jackie and that was it. Okay so maybe 40 minutes is an exageration. I don't know. However, I didn't sleep well because I was stressing out way too much. I need these final pieces done but I can't do them. I still have all my English Lit to do and I can't do it because I don't have the time. This is way too much and if I am not careful I will probably have one of those anexity attacks or just generally freak out.

       Yes the film starts at 12.15. I said on the email see you in the screen rather than everyone meeting before cos they could be quite a few of us.  The air marshalls would be disguised as normal passengers. The ones in Amnerica are on all flights in the US. If there were 6 terrosists as you say then ok so maybe it wouldn't work but at least those on the plane would have a better chance to live rather than dieing without a fight. Like those on teh plane that was headed for the whitehouse, it crashed before then because of the passengers taking over. They died yes, but they still gave themselves a small chance. I can see what you mean as well about them coming over from the Muslim countries but the amount of terrosists we have in our country right now is amazing. So many have been caught etc.. I don't know if it would work but I think its worth a try. Air marshalls to be on suspected flights or random flights. You never know, they may just be there to help one day.

       I believe that the air marshals are going to be disguised as ordinary civillians. Which then suggests that actually, they aren't going to be on many flights.  very good point Jackie. The only time someone has tried to hijack a plane on their own was when that AFrican bloke who was criminally insane tried to take over. But he really was mentally ill I think. If terrorists were going to hijack a plane and do something really evil and horrible, then I would presume there would be a few people, like a team of them. That's what they did on 9/11, I think.   I can't come to the cinema tomorrow, I have to be at work for 2pm. Sorry guys!  How typical is this- (you know on american web pages where they put the top-5 searches? This is one of them, and not off a dodgy site either, the netscape news site!):  Top Men's Searches     Wet T-Shirts  Beach Trips  Micro Bikini  Viagra  Adult Toys

       Guns on airplanes to me sounds like a stupid idea! If that person needed the money someone cud buy them and get them to give them the gun on a flight! Not only that but if there are like 6 terrorists on the plane they can easily take the plane, the air marshals wud be shot and killed possibly with their own guns! Are these air marshals gonna be wearing uniforms? Or are they just gonna look like normal passingers? Nicki you saying about  maybe only on transatlantic flights? Whats that gonna do? the terrorists will be more likely to pick on local flights as they did on the 9/11 attack. Most of the planes brought down were local ones!  No onto more pressing matters... The cinema tmor? You sed meet at 12.15? The film actually starts then though!

       Hmmm. Well I'm still standing by my comments of yesterday, I just wanted to add a few things in response to people's comments. Although I agree to some extent with what Max said, there was still a fair amount of child abuse going on, it just wasn't 'done' to publicise it. For example Myra Hindley, the Moors Murders, the West murders, the kid who was abused and then hung from a tree in Reigate..... there were numerous notorious child abusers/murders. I think it can't have been so easy to get guns 20 or 30 years ago, I think a lot of the guns nowadays are imported cheaply and illegally from America. Hence tighter import checks and better security, and higher penalties for being caught. I don't like the idea of air marshals. Ok, perhaps it may stop loonies from trying to hijack a flight, but why sholud they get them just on trans-atlantic flights? I would have thought that there would be a much higher risk coming from flights from the middle east to Britain and from the middle east to the USA. Without being rascist (although it's going to sound it), most of the terrorists are 'freedom fighters' etc from Muslim and Arab countries. I understand that you can't put air marshals on their flights because they are Arab airlines (not British and American ones), but I really do not think it is anything to do with flights from Britain. What I want to know is,  who is paying for these air marshals- us, the British tax-payers; or the Americans, who are the ones who are so up-tight about it anyway?  I woudl lay my money on it being us who has to fork out for it. But there we go again, me getting back to how Blair has become Bush's lap-dog. Absolutley disgusting that one man can just do what he wants at will with a country.  My final moan for the day on the point of guns. It's not directly related, but I think it needs to be said.  I personally believe that capital punishment should be brought back. People like Ian Huntley do not deserve to live. Ok, God said "Thou shalt not kill", but surely that works both ways- we shouldn't kill him, but he sholudn't have killed in the first place? But look back to the old testament- "An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"- surely this suggests that he should get what's coming to him? More and more British citizens are being imprisoned, and half the time they aren't even British citizens! This pushes up the price of keeping prisoners all the time, and like all the other good things in life, the money spent on the prisons by the good old British governemtn has to come from the tax payers. It would be a darn site cheaper to execute them. No mess, no hassle, no money, no protests about them being allowed to go on hunger strike, not giving them the safety of being locked up so they can't be mobbed for their heinous crimes, not giving them the chance to take their own lives and become 'martyrs' for other criminals of their types. Numerous states in America still use capital punishment, so why can't we? I believe that would be the answer. We should become a more agressive state in our policing policies- more police, more security for them, more severe punishment. Not just 'life sentences' that turn into 10 years behind bars because the culprit has 'reformed' or is let out on 'good behaviour'. If they're sick enough to commit a crime in the first place, then that violent/sadistic/homicidal/perverted/abusive tendancy is always going to be there.  Think that's all i wanted to have a moan about.

       I like the points everyone has made. Especially Jo's. Remember thsi can be discussed all week so we can keep this going. And make it to the blogs of note one day :) hehe.  Guns. Well. I look at America where it is so easy to get a gun. Open a bank account, get a free gun! That is outrageous. It gives the police there no authority at all. I think here our poilce force should be allowed guns. Not big guns, handguns maybe, some sort of gun. Or at least get officers out and about where they can be seen with guns so not everyone can carry then. I think knowing the police have guns would make people think twice about it so I agree with what Jo said. Even though I dislike the French...  I agree with you Jackie about there always being crime but hopefully the presense of guns would decrease general crime or at least put a stop to these shootings. Yes the highest trained gunman could miss but then think of the damage someone who isn't trained could do. I'd rather know there was someone at least slightly trained with a gun than someone who knows little. How about these air marshalls? Guns on planes? I think that we should have them on transatlanic flights, they aremost likely to be hijacked and as American have proved it has worked so far. I understand the worries about guns and the pressure of teh cabin but I think someone said on sky news they woudl take that into consideration and modify the planes or something. Someone else has created bullets which are made specially not to cause damage to the area. One shatters on impact and things like that. I think they are a good idea as I know what its like to be sitting there on a 9 hour flight and wondering what could happen.

       Let a load of people (like the Krays) out on the streets (with guns). When they were around, there was a lot less child abuse and the like. Why? Because the child abusers/killers were frightened because they would be found by em and get killed.  Ian Huntley would have been dead long ago.

       Guns- Death  Thats basically my veiw, guns shouldnt be allowed ne where, surely there must be a better way of patrolling the streets, even if the highest trained professional gun shooted could mis aim and therefor fatally injure someone. I beleive that things like stun guns should be made standard issue for  policce officers as they are far less dangerous. But there again jo has made a good point, crimals wont be so inclined to perform illegal acts if they see police carrying guns.  But if you think about it there will always be crime, whether it be viscious or not. There is nothng we can do to stop it. In my view prevention is better than stopping it mid way.

       No I don't think we should be allowed to carry guns. Bad news. Knives are illegal, and I presume so are guns? I deinetly don't think we shoudl be allowed them, because there is such a fine line between 'self defence' and 'attack' that it woudl be so hard to tell the difference, and there would just be unlawful killings happening left, right and centre. Can you imagine what croydon would be like with guns? http://www.defense.gouv.fr/gendarmerie/ However, I do believe that we should have two branches of the police, as france do. They have the 'Gendarmerie' and 'Police'. The police are like the local units who just work in the rural areas, minor offences in rural areas, blah blah, i think. Then the Gendarmerie are the more military-style ones '[I think they actually refer to themselves as being a branch of the French Army, see  urlLink the official website (If not just for the pictures!) ) ], who patrol urban areas and cities. This reduces the crime rate in cities, and France have a very low gun-crime rate, I believe. I believe that this is due to the scary image of the Gendarmerie- they have bold blue uniforms (shirts, trousers and jackets, all of same colour), knee length leather boots, black caps, and they  all carry guns  , in highly visible places. Yet the french never have any 'incidents' of accidental shooting of police officers and innocent civillians. In addition, in the big towns like Paris, they have gendermerie armed with sub-machine guns. Now that is a scary site, but crime rates? What crime??! I believe our policing system should be changed to allowed armed officers in the centres of towns and high-risk districts, not to protect themselves and other citizens, but to deter and prevent gun-crime altogether. Say you were about to commit and violent mugging on a women, say you were going to knife her to ger her handbag, money and phone, you would perhaps consider it if you see two lone policemen walking down the street, say 500m away, not near enough to catch you. But what if those same two policemen each had a gun holster containing standard-issue pistols? I wouldn't even dream of it, and I don't think any criminal would either. I rest my case.

       Title bar is now gone. I've also brought a new coat. Its a bit matrix like.... lol. Lots of work to do now. Seeing family tomorrow who have come over from America so that'll be fun. Cinema on Wednesday, 12.15, Grants, Peter Pan. Come if you wish, bring who you want.  Question / topic to discuss this week:  Guns.  A policeman was killed a few days ago from a shooting. Should we be allowed to carry guns? America have a death rate of over 11,000 people a year being killed by guns. Your views?

       Ok so the title bar only appears when you are blogging but I guess that may help if you are scanning pats posts? I've been wokring since Friday. Yesterday luckily it wasn't busy at all and didn't have to open the front till too much. I got to put out the pic'a'mix yesterday with Charlene and Lora which was hilariously funny. You have no idea how much fun it is. LOL.  Today I'm on entertainment all day as Caroline is off on holiday. Should be ok.  Tomorrow I have to run into Croydon to get fabric for textiles and then I have to leave because mother is getting my Birthday things. Yayness. Wednesday I'm going to see Peter Pan with Ritchie. I will do something for my birthday with everyone but prob once we are back at college on an evening I know everyone is free. Took a trip last night up to the infamous addington estate. That is not an area you want to park the car in trust me...keep it moving. LOL. Dad was showing me some of the houses there. One of the houses is decorated with lights and whatnot. But tha front is covered, the back is covered, the side is covered and the roof is covered. And its soooo tacky!!! Have fun today!

       Interesting idea. I had an idea a while ago which would make the blog more exciting (slightly) and would hopefully get some good discussions going. Each week I will ask someone to choose a subject / event or sme kind of question. Then basically you spend the next week discussing it as well as normal blogging. For example the title could be: "President Bush". Then people can use that as a starting point. What do you think?

       Have you read those blogs that won awards from that guardian competition? I read the two teenage winners. The boys one was good but not very funny, but the girl called Olivia, hers is just so random that it's really funny. Completly random. I think we should do something to spice up our blog. Like have different cateogries and put someone in charge of each category. Like Our News, World News and our Views, Events in our lives, stuff like that, make  it funny and not just a regular ole blog.

       Yay everyone!!! Well Yesterday I spent the day on crimbo light patrol as our old set are dead. So father and I went to about five different garden centres. Its our crimbo tradition anyway. We came back with nothing so we had lunch and with the firm instructions from mother of 'go and get some christmas lights' we headed out again. Went way out, right off to the M25 to a garden centre there. We brought a set of new crimbo lights, a new candle light set and this sicky stuff to hang your crimbo cards up on. So all in all, a sucess. Yesterday evening Jackie and I went to see  Elf ! I loved it. I love kiddies films. Soooo funny. SAAAAAAAANTA! I know him! I know him!

I nearly lost a toe, being run over by a mad old woman and her trolley. Safeways is a much safer place to live. Plus, they have all their xmas sweeties reduced already. Big Bags of chocolate coins for 39p, and HUGE drums of xmas-tree marshmellows for only 99p. Bargain. Plus 10% off, makes life so much more fun. My mummy got £47 off her shopping in double discount weekend, twas very cool! Meant that the alcohol i pursuaded her to buy was only £3.20- bargain! Anywho, must go now!

       That was very phiospical Max.  Well on Thursday I went shopping with Jackie which was un as we found Beckett and spent about 30 mins sitting on those massage things. How amusing.Yesterday I went to Croydon with Lisa. We shopped ( I brought some skate jeans ) and had pizza hut which was fun. We have a Dutch waiter! Today I worked from 8.30 til 5.30. I have Dean his present, must have been happy with it cos he gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek so that made my made of course. Tomorrow I'm working from 10 til 4.30. Them Monday and Tuseday will most likely be me doing homework as I have many a final piece to do. Wednesday I'm working 1 - 6. Friday I'm working 12.30 - 5.30. Thats good because that is overtime pay so wopee!!  On crimbo day it will be me, Mum, Caz and Dad. That is good because last year we had to post pone xmas for a day as Dad was working so we had our xmas on Boxing day. dad is working on my birthday though which means I'll be spending most of the day worrying because new year eve's party goers who get drunk and stuff can cause an awful amount of trouble and it has been known for police to get injured etc.. so I won't be that happy on that night. Gah.

       Okay Max, Maybe you need to get out a bit more? Well today woz judgement day, i went and saw lord of the rings. Now it woz a gud film although i beleive it could of been considerably cut down in length cause there were many parts you didnt need to see. Also the cinema didnt put a break in like they said a little while ago on there site! I was quite annoyed with that cause i didnt wanna miss ne of the film by going to the toilet! So i waited till it had finshed then rushed to the toilet, ask Andy Scott and DAvid i woz in there for a while! But over all a good film, i would advise you to go see it, but only if you seen the first two films otherwise you would get a bit lost in the plot! So wot are peeps Crimbo plans? Ne one going ne where specail? Tmor im working in the morning then going to my cousins for crimbo dinner, then sunday im working. On crimbo day i think my grandparents are coming over so that should be fun! Other than wokring thats about all im doing!

       Something pretty scary happened today...  I was bored, and I looked at the clock on my PC. The year scale went right up to 2099. By 2099, I would be about 112. No way am I going to live that long. Then something occured to me; one of the dates that is sitting in right front of me is the day i'll die. Nice thought, no? And as well as the fact that the PC could outlive me in terms of time...  Anyhow, um...prawn cocktail Wotsits are minging.

       No Jo. I am not excited. I have too much work to do. Fuck xmas, it can piss off this year.  Damit. Its all your fault Jackie. Because you didn't babysit last night, and you didn't do the weekly text thing I completely forgot Changing Rooms was on!  I MISSED IT. O how depressing. I think I shall fall into Hamlet mode: 'O that this too too sulied flesh would melt....' Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Yay for the trampoling thing though. An I don't go on about it, only mentioned it once because of the hand signal convo. Thats it. Its like my geology class. Every lesson its usually Beckett who brings it up but the subject of Dean and I always comes into conversation. And the room always goes quiet just as we aretalking about it so then either the whole class join in or we're told we are a bunch of gays by Seward. Ahhhh.

       No I'm not excited, possibly because i havent brought any presents yet! My sister arrived home around 1 hour ago, came in for about 20 mins and tehn went striaght back out again! ( You can tell she was glad to see us) I'm really happy at the moment as i just got back from trampolining and i can now do a back summersault into a seat drop! Considering i only passed my back summersault last week im quite proud of myself! I seem to have a bit of a cold, not a runny nose cold but a annoying sore throat, which isnt always there and a horrible throaty gooey feeling... I am also very happy cause i didnt have to babysit tonite! Which means that i have moe time to do homework.. Althoughi bet i dont do anything in this extra time i have been given. I wish i had never told people who i fancy now cause thats all they sem to go on about! Grrrr, How annoying. And no guys you aint finding out who unless i already told you or you find out from somone i told! Now this is feeling like a very long blog to me so i think i will bring it to a bit of a abrupt end.

I've just been exceptionally tired, ill, and so exhausting I come home from school and collapse, and I am getting up so incredibly early to use my light box now, I have hardly any spare time. Oh the joys of being a student/cashier at safeways. At least they pay me lots, and I'm getting a new phone! It's contract, £13.99 a month with 50 free texts amd 750 free minutes, and it's a Nokia 6100! Wahey! I'm excited. Are you?

       I can't believe the gramatical error made: "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him." It should be "we've got him" or "we have got him", not "we got him"; it doesn't make any sense like that. Argghh.

       This pisses me off, terrestrial television listing for today, 11:30AM:  BBC1: Saddam news report BBC2: Saddam news report ITV: Saddam news report Channel 5: Saddam news report Channel 4: Hollyoaks  Police force? It needs to be improved. A zero-tolerance rule should be applied like in the states.  We havent got our Christmas tree up yet. It will be up Tuesday when my Dad gets back from knocking a wall down in his brothers house.

       Interesting interesting. No I haven't heard from Jo. Not since I saw her at Speech day.   I spent half an hour last night sitting in front of my christmas tree thinking about my final art piece for Starky, based around Autobiography. It can be anything so long as you can somehow link it back to you. My link is that my father was a firefighter.  My piece will be based around those firefighters lost in September 11th. (By the way, I releasied this in general studies last week, the Americans go on and on about what a tragedy it was for all those firefighters to die. Fair enough. But what about the paramedics and police? They died too. They all do the same life threatening job. Just in different ways.) What I will do is construct a war cross (American war cemetryes which I have visited - a plain white cross). I will not paint it white but photocopy headlines and pages from books about September 11th and the firefighters. I will cover my cross in it and then create rubble around the base. I want people to remember. I want people at the art exhibitiono to go: 'Wow. I remember that. That piece is really good, I'm impressed.' I remember at last years exhibition someone did a 9/11 piece. It created many a comment.

       I quite like these new community police, they are quite helpful and seem to be doing a great job. When we went up to London on Monday on a coach we drove the whole length of where Croydon is - it really does go quite a long way until it becomes London; but anyway, I saw about 10 of them and half of them were talking to people and doing things. Fortunately I haven't had to talk to a police man for quite a little while, but I hate this racist issue. The press seem to think that every single person in the Met is racist and say they should get more black officers. In case you haven't noticed, you can't advertise specifically for that kind of thing as that is racist. The whole thing has to much PC behind it and I hate it all. I am quite intilted to say what I am about to say as it is a view, a belief, an experience and is true, but there are more black people causing on-the-street crime than white. This is true, and I know myself, all three of the blokes who mugged me where black; and their ain't that many black people wondering around Sanderstead village at 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon in January. So, my point is, the whole thing about stop-and-search being done to more black people than white seems fair to me entirely. I know a police man, in fact I know three, but this one in particular was talking to me about this issue when he worked for Croydon police, and white people do more robbery from houses and other non-violent crime, where as black people do more violent crime. The problem is, there is more violent crime around at the moment. Point made.  Another thing that is really annoying me at the moment is the 'new look' BBC News 24. It's rubbish. The idea of this channel was to become different from all the other 24 hour news channels, to be unique - which it was. Now it looks even more like Sky News which I despise, they are all following the horrible American TV which is truly terrible. BBC Three is dropping the only show I watch on that channel, Liquid News, and instead they had Johnny Vaughn with that chat show he did, which again is identical to these American ones where the audience clap whenever the presenter says a word that has 3 or more syllables in it. So I'm not impressed with the BBC at the moment - although I have been listening to Radio 4 quite a lot recently, I'm turning into an old man.  Oh yeah, one more thing (maybe). Today, while in HMV, browsing my way through the CDs, two blokes next to me, having a chat. Normal everyday things people do; but what are they doing while talking to each other? Holding their penis. Really, you know it's there, you probably saw it this morning when you were getting changed, do you really need to hold it all the time? I know it sticks out a bit, but you can buy special underwear that holds it in if you have those kind of problems. If you're afraid it's going to fall off, don't worry, this is the 21st century, we can glue it back on. But seriously, stop holding your cock, it just isn't right, especially when you're talking to another bloke, and in public.  I watched the Railway Children today, and it made me realise how much PC we have in this world today. It is so stupid it's not true. Signs everywhere telling us what to do and what not to do. Don't stick your head out the window. Don't jump off the cliff. This packet of nuts contains nuts. In the movie, the children are allowed to go out, run around the place, be happy, explore. Now, they would have to be with an adult and wouldn't be able to go and talk to the station master. Alright, East Croydon isn't exactly the best place, but smaller ones like Sanderstead and this wonderful little station in North Wales I went to. The village has about 10 houses in it, and the station is so small you have to ask the train driver to stop at the station when you get on the train; and wave your hand when you see the train coming to stop it.  I'm worried about Jo. She said something about her PC not working, so I can understand her not being on MSN or blogging; but I've text her earlier today and no reply. Hope all is well, anybody heard from her?  Blimey that's a long blog. Need to have a nap now.

       Ok so no one is blogging. Lets have a discussion.  Police. The British police. Croydon police. What do you think?  Asking this because it comes up every bloody general studies lesson and I am putting together my argument about it so that next lesson I can have my say.

       My hand has gone kinda numb this morning and was hurting yesterday. As I won't be at the doctors anytime soon I thought I'd look up what I have on the internet. It may be wrong but I think this is pretty much hitting the nail on the head.    Description  Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when tendons in the wrist become inflammed after being aggravated. A tunnel of bones and ligaments in the wrist narrows, pinching nerves that reach the fingers and the muscle at the base of the thumb. The first symptoms usually appear at night. Symptoms range from a burning, tingling numbness in the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers, to difficulty gripping or making a fist.    Treatment  Carpal tunnel syndrome is treated by immobilizing the wrist in a splint to minimize or prevent pressure on the nerves. If that fails, patients are sometimes given anti-inflammatory drugs or injections of cortisone in the wrist to reduce the swelling. There is also a surgical procedure in which doctors can open the wrist and cut the ligament at the bottom of the wrist to relieve the pressure. However, only a small percentage of patients require surgery.

       That's a rather unfortunate acronym, kind of ironic as well.  I haven't blogged for quite a while, nearly two weeks. What have a done? Not a lot really. I've been listening to Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas quite a lot, which is quite odd because it's not my normal taste in music, but I really like this song; and I have been introduced to Sugarcult who just rock. Rather stressed with the amount of work I have to do, but it's nearly holiday time, only two weeks left, so I'm not too worried. It's my birthday on Saturday, having a driving lesson which should be amusing! Bought my Christmas cards this evening with Jo & co in Oxted (haha, that rhymes).  So a mix of really good and really bad things - I supose they level out.

       Jackie: New look Hotmail. New GUI. Login.  GCSE Certificates are okay now, they were posted to me yesterday and I got em when I come home.  3 things that I think are totally different from each other: I love... (example: "I think she has a really kind nature that I like") I fancy... (example: "Rah! She's well fit!") I like... (example: "Aw, ur nice") Don't quite know how to put that one.

       That Max is why you want a nice four wheeler. Camden was so good today. In fact all of today was good. Paul is so fab.  I am presuming Jo is not posting deliberatly. Well if there is no word from her by end of week I will remove her from blog and we can invite someone else to join. I leave the choice of who to add into blog up to you guys as I think that is what will happen as Jo is being childish.  Tom - your views on the subject of workload?

       Technology: sometimes useless. Example:  10 minutes ago there was this car trying to get up my road. Its not a particularly steep hill, but nethertheless, this big brand new PHAT BMW was trying its hardest to climb the snowy road. Anyhow, it was doing this outside my house for a good 15 minutes. Along came an old, battered Citroen AX or something and went up the hill just as if it wasn't snowing. Useless car designs.

       Ah well that then brings back the question about technology that Max said. Is todays technology like computers, broadband etc.. distracting us from what we SHOULD be doing or is it really just a matter of choice? I personally don't think the workload is too much overall. Its more down to finding the time to cope with it. I for one cannot cope at the moment what with the mocks coming up. I have a 5 hour art exam this Friday and I don't have a clue what I'm doing. Ihave a 5 hour textiles exam next Wednesday and no idea what I'm doing. Add that to Eng Lit where we have to memorise literally the whole novel of 'Enduring Love' as it is not allowed into the exam with us and gelogy of which I do not have a clue. Plus general studies which I don't have any guesses as to what will happen. Its too much. Not too much work just too much pressure to have it at such a high standard even though it needs to be at that high a standard for alevel.

I'm really happy atm. Probably because of Paul. I've got a hair appointment for the day of the Valentines Ball in London so I'm gonna have gorgeous straight hair :) I hope you all like, well, those of you that go. You should come, as a large group, it'll be a good night out I reckon.   And you are allowed to bring people from outside of school so bring people!!  I'm also looking to the cinema tomorrow. Scary Movie 3! Wohoo!!  Jackie, would you like to post the subject / question this week?

       We are a lazy soceity, the rate of obestitiy proves it! 30- 40 yrs ago there wernt T.V's and computers so children went outside to play EVERYDAY, not once a week for 10 mins but they would spend all day outside just playing and mucking around Because all of this new stuff is around children dont do anything, and aldults are just as bad! I'm not saying that i dont agree with all this new technology as it makes life a lot easier and conviente. But what i think needs to happen is control over what is used by parents ect..

       Now Jo thats just silly and how can you be boycotting this blog if your still posting?   Anyway. Lazy society hey? Well. I think the introduction of this ne wmodern technology has completely changed the way we live. Its faster to do things etc... Unfortunatly people are becoming more lazy with dirving to work instead of walking, phoning a friend instead of going around to see them etc.. But on the other hand with this technology being available shouldn't it be up to that person to decide if they use it, or if they don't? I think most of London certainly are getting lazier. Very much so.

       Yes and no. In some cases it has made life easier: i.e: Typing a letter. Thats how it should be. But now we have these super fast PC's *ahem* that play games and scan in our math h/w and it'll do it all for us and spellcheck it.  Phones are lazy as well, whatever happened to the phonebox?  This is the way I see it: It is making society lazier. But I like it somewhat, as long as it isn't expensive for its purpose. For example, a smartphone (costing £500) is enough for me to build a nippy mid-class PC, which I think has more use than the smartphone, plus its cheaper to run. On the other hand, a phone costing £100 range is fair enough.

       OK Jackie, in that case  Tom  can post this week.  Jo, no one said don't grow up just when your blogging when we're havinga  discussion about a topic can you not do it in a supier way. It seems to be that just because you go to Oxted you appear to me automatically more intelligent than us. Your not. Maybe you know more about certain subjects than us do but we're bound to know more than you do in the ones we study.  I get the felling when your blogging away its: 'You can't have that opinion because you don't know the ins and outs so you better change your mind' and then proceed to give us all a full lesson in politics etc...  So this week so should be interesting. I missed my textiles deadline for Friday last week so I should've done all the work over the weekend but I didn't because of work and the fact my sister came home. Work on Sunday was insane. The health and saftey officier decided to pay us a visit in the afternoon so I spent all morning running around cleaning stuff, making asiles safe, helping to clear up stock room. I also had to sweep up all of the trash outside to clear the fire exit. Yuk! I spent last hour or so in the canteen clearing that up and then the entertainment room. It was crazy.  And when I got home I realised I had left my posters by my locker. Darn.

       FOR FUCKS SAKE ITS JUST A FUCKING PLACE TO LEARN STUFF. Look, definitions of it:   College  An undergraduate division or school of a university offering courses and granting degrees in a particular field.  IE: SIXTH BLOODY FORM  AAAAAAAAAH. Now I have been getting the feeling recently Jo that you don't seem to be liking me right now. Whenever we've had discussions on here you seem to love writing paragraphs about how wrong I am and you seem to like to point out your intelligence by bringing up facts etc... Just because I do Art and Textiles doesn't mean I don't know my own opnion. I don't need facts and figures to base my thoughts on. And so what if we go to Sixth Form which happens to be at Warlingham? It is a college, its not better or worse than anywhere else.  And I'd rather you wouldn't post random comments about Paul and Charlene or whoever because you will start to put thoughts into my head and I will start to panic so could you possibly refrain from doing so. That and remember we're not stupid so can you not talk to us as though we are. Or me. Or to anyone else who feels simlar.  Yes I am in an annoyed mood today.

       Its still a college though. Maybe its a bit more set or whatever but its still a college. I prefer Warlingham to going somewhere like East Surrey. Its pretty damm good.  Paul is loverly :)

       How I think of it:  College = East Surrey. No specific times you have to be in. Not ajoined to secondary school. Specific classrooms for specific purposes. Pretty 'loose' campus. 6th Form = Warlingham. Specific times set. Joined onto secondary school. Must follow main school rules. Uses normal secondary school rooms.

       Warlingham has been a college since the Sixth Form begun. That is why it is: Warlingham Sixth Form. Sixth Form being collage. Sixth Form being another name for college.  Plus I prefer to say college than school.  Still an excellent Sixth Form. Nowt wrong with it.

       I stayed utnil 5.30 last night at college. I was doing textiles as I have a deadline for today but I also went to see one of Paul's plays for drama. I've never seen him act before and wow! I am sooo impressed! He is so good! The rest of his group were excellent but I was so impressed with Paul! Yay!!!!!

        With the NHS in the state that it is currently in, should they be forced to treat people, like smokers, who bring illness upon themselves? And what about hypochondriacs who waste valuable space? Should they be treated?    I think with the NHS they should simply take a step back, look at themselves and then sort themselves out. There must be a logical way to sort out the long lists etc... somewhere. Hypochondriacs - well ok so they do waste space, sometimes. Maybe sometimes what they say is true. But they are still entiled to hospital visits. Perhaps it should just be a case of making doctors etc.. more efficent so that they can spot these people, check them out throughly but get them out quickly. Smokers - I don't like smokers. I hate it. Its the thing itself I hate but the people I dislike are todays generation. They all know the risks, they all know it could kill them yet they still go ahead. They are dumb. But those from our parents generation and before, they didn't know and now they do they can't stop. Its a fair argument. Its hard to quit it if you've been smoking for years. They should be entilted to free health care. It isn't their fault. Techically it is for smoking something that is damaging but they didn't know. My gran died from lung cancer and brain tumor. Created by smoking. I had to watch her die and I wish something could've been done about it but it couldn't. I don't blame her for smoking, I don't even blame the cigarette itself. I blame the fact that back then, she didn't know. Maybe it was cool, maybe it wasn't. Maybe it's just something they all did but the fact is she didn't know the dangers, couldn't give it up. Thats fair. Wish she'd have known, wish she would've stopped but hey, I can't do anything about it now.   But back to the question in hand.  Smokers should be given free health care. There should also be more warnings etc.. for us today. Maybe we should even take a lead of out Dublins book and become a city where you are not allowed to smoke in public. In your own home etc.. fine but not in public.  Then again. If your mum or dad had been smoking and you believed they shouldn't get free health care because its their choice, what if they became ill and weren't allowed in hospital. Even though something could be done to save them? You'd have to watch them suffer, maybe die. Its not nice. Would you still feel the same way? Even if they didn't know the risks at the time?

       Many apoglogise to Jackie, I didn't mean any harm by that - it was, as Max said, very different years ago.  I wish I lived back then as well. For example, my favourite quote from Richard Branson's autiobiograhpy... "If nobody was working very well in the office we would all go out for a walk in Hyde Park. Somebody would fall in the lake and we would all go for a swim."  Can't do that any more. Bloody politcal correctness.

       Tom was probably generalising, meaning more detailed methods should go into practice, like beginning the year the campaign ads started or something.  There is something that I am wondering about though. Back in the 60's and before hand or whatever, we had no such things as AIDS or HIV or any of that rubbish. So what the f*** has happened to society?  The government are getting worse as we speak, go fascism and conservative. The world today is piss. I would have loved to live back in the 80's. I could have gone to college and expected something good to be on the radio instead of something crap. Thats just going off topic now.  NHS sucks, pity I have to live with it. I'm gonna wrap myself in cotton wool and try not to break my neck or anything.

       What you to have just said has really offended me, both my mother and father smoke, they started smoking when the dangers wernt known, and then got addicted So you 2 are saying that my parents shouldnt get any help if they go to hospital with a smoking related illness. THat in my opinion is FUCKED UP You 2 are probably coming from the point of veiw that neither of your parents smoke there fore it doesnt affect you, my parents still pay taxes and shit so why shouldnt they get health care for free? Bah And thoses so called hpercondriacs, well if they are known then they will be left until last on the waiting list evct, and for all you know thoses hypercondraites could have something seriously wrong with them, all they are doing is caring about their health. Gah, im in a really bad mood today so excuse the language But grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Boys are stoopid and should go to jail

       I've thought about this for many years, and I've always believed that you should only get free health care if it's not your fault. If you've been run over by a bus, sure, come on in, get it sorted. Been smoking for last 5 years and you can't breath? Money please. That seems fair to me. I have a jaw problem, it ain't my fault, it's just the way I was born - therefore I should be intitled to free health care. The only problem then is that people will start making things up and you'll get even more problems.  If you've got a problem, you've got a problem. I still don't understand how people can think they have a problem they don't, if anything it's usualy the other way round, there should be more people in hospital. Anyway, it does happen and I think people like that should be given little DIY hospital kits to take home and they can sit in their own bed and get their friends and family to play doctors and nurses.  I'm nuts.

       Well well well. I will find it hard to top Tom's rave but I will try.  Since we've been back at college this term I've been feeling sick. More sick each day. Then along some Friday and I can't do anything at school because I'm so busy trying not to be sick. So I get sent up but my form tytor. I come back at lunch thinking well I've had 3 hours kip so I shuld be okish now. I didn't make it to English. I sat in the common room trying not to be sick. I forced myself to textiles as I have a deadline next Friday and cannot afford to miss the lesson. Saturday. Didn't make it to work. Didn't do any work. Stayed in bed. Along comes Sunday. Made it to work for 2 hours then get sent home. Can't go to the cinema either, too ill.  Today I wake up thinking yea I feel better. Eat my breakfast. Bad move. I nearly throw up this time. Don't make it to school. I'm about to go to texiles in a moment simply because I have to do this work. I can't afford not to do it so matter how bad I feel. What really annoys me is the fact that I still haven't been sick! I wish I would be sick because then I'd feel soooo much better. Apparently there is a bug going around work anyway so hey, I'm definatly not making this up. The other annoying thing is on Sunday I could've Paul twice. But I didn't because I'm ill. Could've seen Paul for most of today. Can't. I'm ill. I hate being ill. Although it is rather nice when mum makes me soup and buys me jelly and things that are easy on the stomach. She even cut the crusts of my sandwiches. Marvellous.

       I can't sleep. I've tried sleeping on my back, I've tried sleeping on my front. Perhaps if I sleep on my right? No, I can see the clock now, counting down the hours. I'll sleep on my left. No, that doesn't work either. I'll read my book, a chapter or two. No, that didin't work. I'll listen to some relaxing music. Nope, that didn't help either. I'll go and get a drink of water. That was nice. I want some more water now. I can't sleep.  Let's have a moan about something. The music in our common room. First of all, nobody is really listening to it. When the hi-fi is taken away, everybody does what they always do which is chat. So even with music as loud as possible, everybody still chats; but the music is often so loud I can't hear myself think. Problem number two, the music that is played is shit. There is no other word that defines it, it just really is. Continus beats and some strange person talking over the top of it. So when the radio is put on rather than somebodies nasty CD, it's Kiss 100, which is also shit. Not as shit as some of the CDs people bring in, but still pretty shit. How about Radio 1? That plays music all day long that everybody will like. No? Alright, Capital FM? Too much pop? Alright, try Virgin. Not a chance; bunch of selfish bastards. Wait until the lower sixth become upper sixth, then we'll show 'em.  A thought has just come into my head. There are no real swear words. Let me explain; shit means poo, piss means just that, fuck means to plant a seed, wanker means to do that naughty thing boys do, bitch means female dog, bastard means your parents arn't married, prick means something sharp and pointy. There are no proper swear words! Even my own alternative, cabbages, means a green vegetable thing. I say we event a word that is purley for cursing with, a proper swear word. It has to be an all purpose word though, so it has to fit in the asterisks in the following: "**** off", "You stupid ******", "That's a load of ****", "Britney is such a *****", "I hate Justin, he's such a *******". So, all purpose, generaly insulting word; can't think of one, I'll try and go to sleep, I'm sure I'll think of something.

       Right ok I am here. Now I won't be able to reply with something full of facts and figures etc.. simply because I don't do any subject to do with stuff like that except general studies. And in general studies Max and I made a very sucessful presentation about it all. We came second in the polls. We voted for the communisits. I say send them to France simple because France - I dislike. Thats not a decent reason to say that I know but hey, thats me. Like I say before, I don't know that much about it all. I don't mind the seekers who happily pay there way and live quietly without causing problems. Thats fine. I understand about war countries and goverments pursuring people and stuff and yes its horrible for them which is why I say with the amount we'd save on the illegal ones being kicked out we could help those countries. Thats also a better way than sending in our army like Iraq. But hey, I don't really know what I'm talking about. I don't know all the ins and outs. I have no need to know really. Only time it bothers me is when I'm in Croydon and they're all around and its like ah get away. Yea, I guess what I'm saying is we should send the illegal immigrents away somewhere, anywhere, else and find another way of helping them.  Tomorrow  Jo  will be choosing subject/question.

       I don't mean people like Neil who have been born here and all but the past few years we seem to have had a rush of folk come over and its like get away!!!!!! People like Neil's grandmother, fine. They pay their way we are paying for their living expenses. They don't cause hassle but its just the ones who don't pay their way, who clutter up our country.  Liek I said before, simple solution: send them all to France.

       When you say immigrants, I am sure you mean illegal immigrants or illegal asylum seekers? If you want to kick out all immigrants you have to loose Neil. Neil's grandmother came over from India, she earns her living, she pays her taxes, she owns her own house. However, I do agree that illegal immigrants should not be allowed in the country, as it really is taking the piss now.  I have to disagree with point number 2. "Eighty-seven per cent of the population of England and 96 per cent of the population of Wales gave their ethnic origin as White British."  If they are going to come over here, they should speak English, they should get a job, they should earn a living not hang around Croydon late at night not doing a lot. If you thank that's mean, Croydon has higher amounts of Asian or black than the national average. For example, black or black British in Croydon is 13.3%, in the whole country 2.1%.   urlLink  Source: 2001 Census, ONS

       Reasons to kick immigrants out: - They take up valuable housing and jobs which could be taken by actual British people - True Brits are now a minority - They take our money, give nothing back  Think about the amounts of money we would save from husing and feeding them if we sent them away!! We may then be able to sort out our hospitals or provide more funding for police and things. Or with some of that money give it to the warn torn countries to help their people directly rather than sending them all here. They annoy me, I walk around Croydon and I feel uneasy. Partly because of the hoddlums around but partly because of them. I know they've come to start a new life etc... I know their countries may be war torn etc... but there are other ways of helping them. Soon Britian won't be Britain anymore.  Send them all to France. Let the French deal with them. They are a big enough country. That or at least make it a lot and I mean ALOT harder for them to get into this country.

       Hmm. Good question Max. I do not know the anwser to that but onoe good point about it is that at least when you go to foregin countries you get some great bargins. But also hopefully with the expenses of living here we shoudl be able to kick the immigrents out. Wohoo.  I am not a happy bunny. I have been up since 4. I cannee sleep.

       One of the reasons why everything seems so expensive, especaily compared to the USA, is because we earn so little... Average annual income in the United States of America: US$34,280 Average annual income in Japan: US$35,610 Average annual income in the United Kingdom: US$25,120  Bastards.  I just watched a really good movie called 'Live From Baghdad' about the CNN news team in the first Gulf War; a really interesting and quite amazing movie, it's around on TV at the moment, look out for it, it's worth it. On the subject of Baghdad; Nicki, for my Christmas/birthday present got me The Baghdad Blog by Salam Pax, who wrote about the war from the city last year. I never read it online, but the book is great. Also I got a rather interesting book about the Matrix; my brain can't cope with too many books at one time, so I'll tell you more about it when I start reading it. So thanks Nicki!  I'm going to find some ice cream, and perhaps eat it.

        This week's topic: Why is Britian so high priced?   In France I see a little girl of about 9 go up to the counter and buy a pack of ciggies for what I worked out to be £1.15. Gap in america was cheap, I got one of my favourite polo necks from the store for only £2.50. Leather goods are so much cheaper as well.  For example, I want to buy a new motherboard for my PC. The one I want costs £85 in England. In the SAME STORE, but in the USA, it is £55. Why???

       Yep, I'm home. Home home home. I've had a lovelly time, a good break to get away from the pressures that all of us have. If you want to hear all the boring details come and talk to me. So today, I went shopping. In London. I bought lots of things.  urlLink Eddie Izzard - Sexie  (DVD), very funny!  urlLink Sugarcult - Start Static  (album), very good!  urlLink Black Eyed Peas - Shut Up  (single), just because that song's cool. I also bought a nice pair of jeans for £20 reduced from £50 in Gap - not bad at all! The main thing I went in for I didn't get because it's "out of season", grrrrrr. When I want to buy something, I want to buy it now, not when it's sunny, you silly people. Still, I also bought  urlLink Ministry of Sound Very Best of Chillout Sessions  which is very relaxing. So now, I'm off to bed.

In fact my stupid cheesy mood has made me have a go at Charlene for no real cheesy reason and now I feel cheesy well bad about it so sorry to anyone I have bitched to today my apologies.  And I was going to write pages and more cheesy pages but to be honest I can cheesy well be cheesed.

       Croydon is a London Borough and is in the county of Surrey. Croydon is a town and so has a council. I live in Sanderstead, which is part of Croydon. Nicki lives in Hamsey Green, which is part of Croydon. Warlingham School is outside Croydon (by about 5 metres) and so is part of Surrey County Council. That is why we get Surrey ambulances at school and a mix of Surrey and MET police.  However, northern Croydon stops being Surrey and is part of the county of London, although never written like that. The City of London is actually quite small and covers between Westminster Bridge and Tower Bridge (or there about). The Queen, for example, does not live in the City of London, but lives in London.  The centre of London, such as Westminster and the City is very different. London then technically speaking becomes a county and Westminster is a City within London, hence the signs saying "City of Westminster". The towns around London, within Greater London, are part of the counties they are in, but the MET control the whole of Greater London.  However, Thornton Heath, which is in Croydon, is in the Surrey part, but it has a London postcode: SE19. However, other parts of Thornton Heath are in the Surrey part of Croydon and have CR7 for their postcode. Most of Surrey has Croydon postcodes; those living in Warlingham and Caterham with CR6 will know.  London Gatwick airport is quite far south in Surrey, but is London's second airport, with Heathrow being first. Gatwick is confusing because it spans Surrey and West Sussex - the airport being in the latter.  There are also constituencies to worry about as well. Warlingham School is in Tandridge, with Croydon to the north and Mid Sussex to the south. This is how the governments look at their national statistics. However, the constituencies within that are broken down even more.  I get BBC LDN for my local news, as I receive cable from Croydon and terrestrial from Crystal Palace (which is another town, although not very big, but is part of Croydon). People living in Tandridge should receive BBC South East as their local news – but I do not think any of us live that far to reach that news.  According the BBC and the office for National Statistics, Croydon is in London and Tandridge is in the South East.  My address is officially: Sanderstead, South Croydon, Surrey – because, on a map, that is exactly where I am.  There.

       Croydon is covered by the met police. I agree.  But then again I have an address saying "Croydon, Surrey" from my work experience. Its by thw Whitgift Centre. Surely can't be that not up-to-date can they?

       No Tom! Grr. LOL.  MATT: Technically Croydon is still London you fool. The council works differently. Croydon used to be a part of Surrey but it isn't anymore. Yes I know on peoples addresses they say Surrey like mine does but that is because its on the border. Plus there is a road the same name as mine in Croydon itself so by putting Surrey they know which one.  Croydon is a London Bourough, its South London. Just very very South. It is covered by the Met police, not the Surrey police.

       Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls let us give a proper El Bloggo invite to Matt! *silence* Wooo! the friendliness! Hey Matt all ya do is blog away!!!!!! Talk about what you wish and things. Most Mondays / Sundays someone posts a subject to discuss all week. There are a few basic rules which are: a) no blatant or however it is spelt promo for a website (cough david t cough) and b) no excessive swearing unless your in an incredibly evil / mad / depressed mood. Fair? I think so.  Well the ball last night was fab. Jackie, Matt and Max, you sooooo should've come! It wasn't really valentines influenced at all in fact it was just like the leavers ball except it was on a boat and there wasn't as much food. But it was soo good. I got Dean to buy me a drink, go me. It was so fun. Paul looked so loverly :) Everyone looked so loverly. I went to bluewater today with Lisa and my rents. I got some new shoes! And a few other things so it was a sucessful day in all.   Right now I am going to go and collaspe onto my bed after I have tided the chaos that is my room as it is in mayhem from getting ready yesterday. Rah.

       I feel that having 6 people would be too crazy if everyone were to be posting. It would be too much to catch up. I think that 5 people are enough. For now anyway.  I don't think there is any need to make people apply seeing as this is just a blog as has been pointed out. Looks like its going to be Matt is everyone ok with that?

At the end of the day once I am back from work I will be removing Jo from the member list unless she blogs so lets think up the next person to invite to join our blogging. Its up to you three so lets hear your ideas. Now that exams are over we can carry on with the weekly debate type o thing so  Tom  you may post Mondays question / subject.

       I've done one exam this week. Technicaly two if you count general studies, but that doesn't really count. It was ICT and my hand got tired from writing, so combined with the fact that we walked into the exam blind having never seen an ICT AS paper I think I did pretty well; D if I'm lucky. Yay...  On to happy times.   Look what arrived today! Yay! I can listen to my tunes all day long.

       I think you should invite as many people as possible and see which people stand out and actually write something; so what if it's a frenzy of crazy stuff, it will be quite a contrast.  I don't like Rousseau, I think he's a bit of a ponce. And he's French, which doesn't help.

       I know, lets discuss the great Britsh public. Why is it that the day when your all supposed to be home faffing around your mother, giving her presents etc... that instead the Britsh all come out to Woolworths? Why is it that people don't buy cards or presents until the day they are needed? Why is it that everyone is buying their mother either Calendar Girls or Love Actually?? Seriously! We'vce sold like 10 copies of LA today already!!!!!!! Aaaah!!!  The thing that is most insane about today is that our old manager Pam booked Charlene and Dean a day off today. They are both off. Leaving us with 4 people in house until 2 when Lora goes. Leaving us with 3. 3 people. 2 people to work 3 tills which we refuse to do because you need at least noe person running around when needed but at the same time we have to do the charts etc... AAAAAAAAAAH.

       When things like this happen it makes you question humanity.  And its a shame. It does need to stop. Completely. But it won't.  I am going to Spain in roughly 3 weeks. I hope everything is OK.   I have a dent in my head above my eye from where I hit my head on the corner of the corner seat yesterday. Grrr. Then i had to go to work. To do the delivery. But it didn't even turn up. Which is good because that means not much work this weekend. Hehe. But it meant I kinda wasted 2 hours (paid though) when I could've gone and joined in with the quiz night. Grr. Fine.

       I am just disgusted. I can't express with words what my family and I feel today. My condolences to the families of the people that today said goodbye for the last time. God bless you.  Nuria, Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, Spain   I would like to send my condolences to all family's victims. I'll pray for them tonight. God bless them.  Ítalo Cavalcanti, Fortaleza, Brazil   I can't believe it! All this horror! For what? When will it end?  Jonathon Tong, Madrid, Spain   Has anyone realised that the bomb blast in Madrid was on the 11th March, six months from 11th September. Is it coincidence, or perhaps a deliberate plan on the part of the terrorists?  Julie Oswald, Northumberland   As a person who grew up and lives in NYC, I wanted to let the people of Madrid, Spain to know that our prayers are with them.  Dennis Lee, New York, USA   My son age 16 called from Alcala De Henares to say he was ok. He is on a trip with 7 other students studying at the international school there for 2 weeks from Texas. Our small town in Texas sends our sympathy and our prayers for all the people and country of Spain. My son said it is a horrible tragedy like our 9/11 was to our country. We may be from different countries but we are all family created by our father. We are mourning now with you Spain.   Lynda Pohl, Belton, Texas U.S.A.   We just want peace and justice.

       This is starting to turn into a one person blog.... :(  How do you think the music issue is coming along then? I thought yesterday lunch was quite funny with yet another fight which consisted of Bradley v me, Eddie and Colette. It was funny mainly becauise their argument consists of 'fuck off'. Nice. I had the best lunch today. I spent the whole hour cuddling Paul and it was so nice. :)  Jackie has new shoes!!!!!

       Matt has officially been removed now from this blog and I reckon at least 5 people would be better than 4 as not everyone blogs that much if you see what I mean so again if you have anyone you would like to join this nominate them.  I ust got in from work and I am sooo tired. I ache all over because I've been doing delivery today and its all very heavy. VERY heavy. Tomorrow I'm doing full day then 2 nights during the week. I would say gah but I actually volunteered for extra hours. Next Saturday I have swapped shifts so I'm working afternoon so I get a lie in. Woo! I feel so bad when I moan about feeling tired after a 4 hour shift. Well, 4 and half. Especially when people like Paul work all day! Like proper all day. Awww. I see Paul tomorrow. Wooo! :P

       Wooooooo! Discussion! People blogging! Wooooo!!!  Well I'll admitit, at teh begining of the year I really didn't mind Joe putting his CD's on, i didn't mind listening to kiss all day. I admit some of the songs were good. Even got my feet tapping away but now I'm totally against it all mainly because of the way its been handled. I wouldn't mind Joe putting his CD's on if he asked everyone first 'Does anyone mind if I change the CD?' or if he waited for the actual CD to finish but he doesn't. He just goes and turns it off whenever he pleases, like its HIS stereo and it isn't. Its everyones. I know poeple have different tastes, lok at my CD collection. I own a bit of everything. Pop, Rock, RnB, Soundtracks, Jazz atc... I don't mind what we listen to I just wish it was dealt with in a better way. But I agree, the best solutionis simply no stereo at all. When they took it away for a week the common room was so much better. You could hear yourself think, you could have conversation with people without shouting and no one got wound up for people changing the CD or radio station. Yes, I vote too,  Get rid of the CD player . If people want to listen to stuff they can bring in their own personal stereos.  I saw the drama plays last night. WOW. I am so proud of everyone who was in them :) Only thing that annoyed me slightly was that they decided to tell me as we were all leaving that I was invited to Pizza Express with them as the drama group were going. Grrr. Tell me a few days before and I can get money. Tell me five minutes before and gah. Ah well. That doesn't matter anyway, the plays were sooo good and I would say more but I have to go to work so byeee.

       I agree with Jackie; nobody really listens to it anyway, and most people have their own music anyway - it just causes problems. I think we should get rid of it, the atmosphere is always much more pleasant without it.

       Hm, I will listen to practically anything... But especailly Justin Timberlake! Tee Hee Joe's music to me is okay, but i dont want to listen to it everyday, the same goes for the kinda stuff the grungers listen to. I prefer pop type songs or ones with beats and lyrics, such as songs from blue, westlife, ect The problem is easy, get rid of the stereo, if someone wants to listen to music, play it in a personal player ect... simple

       My tastes in music vary, but only slightly. I like all kinds of 'rock'. Yes, it is classified under 'rock', but there are different styles like 'classic rock' (e.g. Beatles), nu-metal (Rage against the machine), Hard rock (e.g. Guns N Roses), progressive rock (Pink Floyd). I also like quite a bit of 80's stuff, including classic 80's pop tracks.  Now, the common room......I reckon the days should be spilt over the two weeks and divided into 'sections'. One music 'style' should be played per day. One being Kiss radio, one being rock that the majority of the grungers like, and the other 'defined' styles like Rap, House, Garage, Living room, utility room, bedroom, front porch, larder storage, or whatever other music like that there is.  Splitting is the only fair way to control both sides. By me saying 'both sides' I mean Joe vs. Simon/Charlie vs. Rest of 6th form. (using as an example because they have two completely different music tastes).  Also. What struck me is....that music that is always being played gets turned off or changed. For example, that Pokemon song, nobody turned it off and it has been played three times that I have heard. I reckon nobody turned it off because it was a CHANGE. Something that nobody has heard for ages.

       I like music. I enjoy listening to all music, considering the differences and appreciating the different styles around the world and in all the cultures. This is something which most people really cannot do as they live in their shallow world of only listening to one style of music, which quite frankly, bores me to tears. My brother and Paul have this habit in the mornings, getting ready to go to school, of only listening to rock, and if it is not rock or a song that they have not heard before or is not to there usual taste, will straight away change the channel. At all costs, they will watch Kerrang! or Q. If a song, for example like this morning, came on by Oasis then that’s not ‘rock’ enough for David and Paul so they want to watch something else. Both of them call all other styles of music crap, rubbish or just bad. It is not bad music at all, they just live in a shallow world.  How about listening to new music rather than sitting in your shallow musical worlds and listen to the other music out there? I do enjoy rock, I really have no problem with it, it’s one of my favourite styles, but I also enjoy all other types of music.  This kind of behaviour is very similar to Joe, he enjoys his particular type ‘music’; however Joe expresses it in the different manner: by inflicting it on the rest of the 6th form who really, do not care for it at all. I do not mind listening to Kiss (being the most popular in the common room), they play some good songs that obviously Virgin would never play. Most people seem to be happy, everybody has their personal favourite, but as far as pleasing as many as possible a combination of Kiss and Capital, with Virgin after school, seems to be fine.  However, Joe’s ‘music’ is where ‘ urlLink music ’, defined as “ urlLink an artistic form of auditory communication incorporating instrumental or vocal tones in a structured and continuous manner ” stops being music. His ‘music’ gives me head aches, he always plays the same songs, and he doesn’t give a flying fuck about what anybody else thinks. The continuous beats with some bloke who probably mugged some kid on the way to record the song. Joe does not even buy the songs; all those CDs are burnt and obviously the songs have been stolen through the Internet. If you support and enjoy music, buy the bloody song.  Tomorrow I am going to buy the Britney Spears single Toxic. Why? I like the song, it has a fabulous violin part, which is ringing around in my head, it has interesting lyrics, to me it is a good song, just like when I bought Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas. If any of you think buying either of them is sad, pathetic, stupid, silly or whatever - you can go fuck yourself. I enjoy listening to all kinds of music and deciding on what I want to listen to, not what an industry wants me to listen to or sitting in a shallow world of a mono-style.

       So. This is an interesting conversation. . . .  Um yea so I went Croydon with Ben to give advice on presents he was buying. We had dinner at Pizza Hut which was cool. We had a giggle. Er what else. Um. Just had a wicked shower. Nice and waaaarm which was cool. Lol. Um, I miss Paul :( Lots of mayhem going on on msn atm. I should really go do some work. Gah. I am now working all day Sunday and probably some evenings after school next week. Most evenings actually. Which is good because of money and this time if I am knackered or whatever I'm just not going to moan because it annoys people so. Yea.  Good advice dudes: Listen to your heart. Yea.  Um seeing as no one is really blogging I'll post a subject thingy for now in case someone wants something specific to blog about:  The music problem in the common room

       Just to clarify I spent most of yesterday having a go at most people so don't feel hard done by. Yea I know you have work, so does everyone else but it only takes a few minutes to write a few lines. And both of you type fast so, um, yea.  But anyway. I have noticed that on tusedays when Paul is at work I actually come home and get on with work rather than sitting on msn until he comes on. LOL. So now I have nearly finished a wall hanging. Only 2 things left to finish for textiles which I should be able to do by Friday. But now I have about 3/4 pieces for art to finish so, um, pants.

You don't know what goes on in my life behind the name of  » Max « eMac Fund: £322 of £756 - November Rain (http://www.maxpayne.co.uk)  so please don't have a go at me. Nicki knows the reasons why im not blogging why I should. I've told her and I've requested something to be done about it. It isnt my fault.  Other than I have blisters on the back of both feet from walking home all the time, i'm whoop-de-doo. Seriosuly.  The parents have stolen the computer room, meaning I am downgraded to the 400Mhz laptop. Pathetic. I need my own PC for my room. One that I can modify and build to my own specification without anybody hindering me in the process.

       Oh for fucks sake. Re-reading that it sounds like I am having a go at Paul for staying late. I'm not. Just better clarify that point. I'm not.  Ahhhhhhhh I wanna go beat someone. Ooo lets get Joe the flannelt wearer! He is really starting to pee me off. What a man bitch. Lets give him a bitch slap.   I have decided I want a mini. A proper nice mini, I want some mini adventures.  I have also decided that I can't be arsed to be unhappy anymore while actually at school because it just pisses everyone else off so I will be 'happy' and I won't annoy you all, that much. I say that much because I am sure I will annoy you at some point for some reasons and oh my gosh Tom is strong he can pick me up and carry me. He carried me across the common room earlier. So did Rudland. I was amazed.   But enough of that.  BRB I got chocolate to go get. . . . . . . . . . . . Ok I'mback and now I am eating chocolate which I shouldn't because eating chocolate makes you insanely fat. Well not you, me. I once wanted to be a model. Pah. Good dream that was. You gotta be thin to do that.  Fucking bloody quality street. I mean what a total rip off. They are tiny now. Not the good nice big one we used to get. Now they are tiny. Little fuckers.  I want the YMCA on cd because I want to go cheer myself up but I can't because I don't have it on CD and nor do I have Buttercup on cd and I can't be bothered to do much else except moan on here so you can put up with it.  Actually I can't even be bothered to moan now. I think I'm gonna go sit on msn and annoy whoever is online. Lets have a look.. Lisa. Nah I won't annoy her. Max. Oi Max blog biatch. Ant. Hmmm. I haven't spoken to him in a while. Maybe. Jason. Nah don't speak to him much. Jane. Nah. Although she is fun to annoy. Charlie. No I like Charlie. Me. No I won't annoy myself oh wait too late already have. Eddie. Nah. Too much effort that. Lora. Nah. an no one else is online because THEY ARE ALL DOING DRAMA. I really want to watch the Sound Of Music but my sister has the video so ahh. Maybe i will go watch Sister Act 2? Who knows??  Or maybe I will just sit here and FUME.

       ARRRRRRGH. Look people do you think you can blog? Otherwise there really is no point in this. I get the impression Tom you aren't happy now that Jo has gone because you blog like NEVER. And Max: your like online all the bloody time so just fucking blog. Am I in a good mood? NO I AM FUCKING WELL NOT. Its fucking freezing and I have been at school until 5 mins ago waiting for Paul who is STILL in drama and yes fine reherse but i have been there since fucking 3.35!!!!!! And now I am incredibly pissed off because I spent the last like half hour waiting as on actually waiting. Doing NOTHING. I had no homework left to do or anything and its just like ahhh. Why I am always waiting for other people?? This isn't directed at anyone, I just don't get why I am the one always waiting for people, waiting for everyone else Ack. And I haven't seen Paul today hardly. Lunch he was doing some prefect thing and then now hes still in drama so argh. So I am not impressed and I just want to see him but apparently not. So wopee. So tomorrow I think I may just sleep all of fucking lunch. Sorry for my language but I'm pissed off at many many things.  Have a good evening.

This week for me has contained good and bad days, so overall it was a boreing week, lots of reminders to do things i should have done 5 weeks ago. Is it me or is every teacher in the school currently having a go at 6th form classes??? Grrrrrr makes me angry, and then this morning i walk into school and who is waiting for me at the door, that lovly lady, Miss SHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just waiting to pounce on me and have a go for missing her lesson, grrrr. Anyway a nice long weekend to follow. I want to propose a rule that no one does any school related work on bank holiday Monday? anyone with me? Well i am sorry this isnt very exciting today, talk to you all soon, have a briliant long weekend. Oh the life moto thing,  'Expect the best, but prepare for the worst' Dave

        If you want a job done properly, do it yourself.  I would never let my Dad perform maintenance on these PC's, as he would bugger it up before you can say 'cheese'.  A massive W00T because Waitrose have kept me on file from January when I applied, and they are now recruiting and have chosen me and a few other people to attend an interview on Saturday at 2:30.  Have yet another computer upgrade request from a girl called Eolie in year 11. Another w00t. Selling my AIO printer for £30. W00t again.  The course I want to take at university will be one of: (BSc) Computer Architecture And Design (BSc) Computer Systems Engineering (BSc) Computer Systems  Sometimes they are Hons, sometimes they are not.

       I don't really have a motto, and anything I do tend to say a lot, I usually steal ou of songs. Just general inspiring things. Here's one of my favourites. Its more a speech really, but I love it:  "Everyday a man wakes up And everyday a man tries to pour himself a cup of coffee, And take a good long hard look in the mirror. Sometimes what he sees in that mirror he doesn't like, And sometimes what he sees makes him angry,  and sometime what he sees makes him sad. Sometimes what he sees is himself And that dissapointment just gets into you and rips you out, Little be little, piece by piece.  And sometimes you can just lay down You can just play the game You can take the cards that they deal you And you can just pretend it's all over... ....BUT NOT ME"

       I know your all busy but could you guys do a quick post please. Thanks.   What is your motto and why?  Mine is 'it's never as bad as being shot in the neck, unless you have been shot in the neck'. Why? Because I watched a program and it showed someone as they were and then after they had been shot in the neck and it is horrid. You take a while to die, they can't save you (depending where bullet is but higher percentage of not saving), and you die a slow death by drowning in your own blood. It's horrid so it can't be as bad as that.   What about you all?

       Well actually Tom, that isn't the course at that uni I was looking. And I  do  need to do a foundation course because that if how you build up a decent portfolio and please stop trying to tell me I'm wrong. I am quite happy with the way I am handling it, I have spoken to my art teacher and she actually said do the foundation course because you get to experience new arts and stuff.  If you say any more about it without me asking you do you know this or do you know that I'm gonna get really annoyed even though I already am quite annoyed because I don't appreciate people telling me me own ideas especially when you don't even want to do fashion design or something along those lines I think I would know a little more about the fashion courses. Sorry if that sounds rude but this term I am very pissed off at people copying my ideas and trying to tell me what to do. I am my own person you know. I can do stuff myself without people telling me or then copying me.

I have looked at the courses I want and they all require a portfolio and a foundation dipolma thing some of which the unis actually allow you to do there and then go on to the course so actually Tom for me personally it is not optional and when I asked them about it they said you could apply without a portfolio but you'd have a much better chance of getting in with one seeing as one of the courses only has 45 places on it so yes, I do need a foundation course and portfolio. I can't even remember what the unis are. Only one I can remember is Nottingham Trent uni.  Cool Jackie I was planning on wearing a skirt as well!!! Lol. So hey we can be skirt buddies? lol. What skirt is it? Short skirt? Long skirt? Denim?

       Er right Tom... No problem Paul :p Max, you deserved it.   The Butterfly Effect , sunday, films starts at 6.00. See you in the screen if you wish you come.  So I got the weekend off. Yay! I spent today cleaning my room and looking through the "propecti" (LOL). Gah. If I choose to do an art or fashion course I have to do a foundation diploma degree thingy. Which is good because I'll have an extra qualification but still. Gah.

Don't wanna clog up your guys blog with too much sentimental stuff, but I can honestly say that if it wasn't for Nicki, I dunno if I'd have been able to make it through this week, so thank you :)

Its pretty crazy. Was pondering buying one myself and bringing it to school as stress exam relief. Could work could work.  So the vending machines are sold out and don't work. Thats like not good.

       Hi, Tom - i can tell you the three digit firgure was over £100.  Nicki - in order to lay this whole gay thing to rest, i think we can come to the aggreement that the use of the word is wrong, when in the context of a way of describing something which is bad.  My day has been pretty depressing compared to the great holiday, but thats life. Hopefully tommrow will be better. talk to you all soon Dave

       The word  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  springs to mind.  Now I believe I have mentioned the fact that my computer died and wiped all my work off including work shadowing letters? Well. The printer wasn'tworking this morning so I stayed after school to write the letter on the comps there but of course all our passwords were changed to numbers and I don't know my number so I couldn't get in so I am attempting to write it now but my computer is being very tempermental so lets beat it up. Yuss!

       Hmmm... The work i was doing last night, I have now found out did NOT have to be finished, so now I am majorly pissed off.. I have now got 4 fucking pieces of fucking coursework to be finished by the end of next week. So I probably won't be talking much on msn. Today was crap, I want the summer holidays to come!  And I wish them bloody kids would stop setting the fire alarm off.

       This whole 'gay' thing. I get pissed off when people say it as well, I know lots of gay people, some get annoyed others don't. I don't mean to offend anyone but I've given up pointing out exactly what you point out because no one listens and no one stops saying it. Its not as if I sit there and actually mean the computer is homosexual. Blame it on the society we live in today. Everyone says 'proper good' and 'gay' as general terms now. I really don't think people are out to annoy you. So sorry for saying it but my computer really is the most annoyinly bitch ever. IT NOW TURNS ITSELF ON RANDOMLY. WTF is up with that???? So bad to start to a worse day. I couldn't find half my book sthis morning and paniced. Wooooooooo! I have a full days of lessons today, I am supposed to bring all my stuff in but to frank with you I cannot physically carry 3 folders, 3 sketch boks and about a hundred other random books in because I will DIE.

       Hi, Its late, and i am not gonna write a full essay. a couple of things i would like to bring up. Paul - If you wanna argue about it, then we will arrange to meet up some time and i will quiet happily go into it further. Crispy - i put on 3 pound, and my dad put on 4! Today i went to work on some lights at AMF, i have just finished typing their invoice which (i cant say the amount online) but i have made a 3 digit figure, lump sum out of my work there, and i am very happy. After i finished there i went to waynes and spent some time with him, fixed a computer came home, typed stuff for AMF. Looking forward to school which starts in 8 hours from now!!! Brilliant stuff.

       Dave- calling something gay is really no different from calling someone a bastard... it doesn't mean that they are really an illegitimately born child does it? And I'm sure people who were really born when their parents weren't married aren't gonna take offence at the term

       Well I should of gone into school today to hand in coursework. But considering I haven't finished it I thought I better not. I will finish it today and hand it in tomorrow. She can't get that angry at me because I know some people arn't handing it in until tomorrow anyway.  I have got to babysit tonight which means an extra £5 to spend, Although I just remebered I owe Nicki £2 or £3. As she brought me a train ticket and I never paid her the full ammount back.  I had a huge fright this morning because my mum phoned from work saying are you sure you haven't got school. Now I was thinking that the teacher I was seeing today had phoned up, but in fact all it was, was that when my mum drove to work she saw all of the cars in the school car park. Forrtuantly I told her all the teachers had to go in, so the scare was avoided.  To david- I wonder whether you put on any weight? And also what did you spend your winnings on? I hope it was something for me.  Wow, I can't beleive I am making such huge posts recently! Maybe it's because I am putting off doing work if I type long things?

       Hi everyone, After having a great time reading your posts I have a few comments to make, One - Nicki - Computers are as of yet mechanical devices, they do (supposedly) what we tell them to, there is no way in the world that your computer or any other computer could be homosexual. I get fairly pissed off when everyone uses gay as a term for something people don't like, WHY DO IT. I know loads of gay people, and i know it offends some of them, and I don't think its fair. (sorry if it seems like I am having a go, don't mean to) Two - Paul (and anyone else who don't know) - I do now have a girlfriend (believe it or not) She is called Becky Aspland, I have been with her for about a week, she goes to Archbishop Tennisons, is nice, what else can I say?   Ok now on to my day, my plan for today was to get up early sort out the 100000000 hours worth of coursework I had to do and sort out my life, a very time consuming activity. However as life is life, things didn't go to plan, not at all. I got up at 10:30 sort early compared to 2pm. So instead of doing work I played Transport Tycoon,  Then I decided I should eat (here's the start of the most stupid thing I have done for ages) My mum decided she would make me and my dad a fry up, we had too much bacon (I don't know why?) so she gave me and my dad 5 'bits' each, as we ate it we talked about weight watchers (which my mum does) we discovered that me and my dad would only be able to eat 18 points each day, my mum worked out how many would be in our breakfasts, and then we decided to keep a track of everything we ate today, this stupidly soon turned into a competition, however not who could stick to 18 but who could eat the most points during today. Well this has got really out of hand, we are both nearly throwing up at each move we make but are still eating to try and win the massive £1 reward. ITS VERY SILLY DON'T DO IT. Anyway now I am watching 'what lies beneath' actually I am not I am watching, my brother watching 'what lies beneath' (he is scared!!!!!!!)  Anyway have got to go prepare my equipment for tomorrows, low work, high pay, work at AMF. Looking forward to that one, but now looking forward to waking up at 8:30, Anyway hope everyone is good, (sorry if I have wrote loads,don't wanna strain anyone's eyes or something like that)  See you all soon, Dave

       I guess I should blog really as I haven't for the past few days. Its possibly because I am addicted to www.habboforum.com at the moment. Not something I am proud of.  As yet I have done no school work, which means tongiht and tomorrow I have an awful lot of work to do. I have three peices of coursework to be done and numerious peices of homework. I have done no revision or even looked at any of my work.   I feel that I may be retaking my exams... the fact is, I have no urge to do any work. To me it is boring and I always find better things to do, such as habboforum.  The holidays have been quite good, Been to Thorpe park, Brighton and the cinema, But thats about it. I would of liked to go to the cinema  again, but most people either can't be bothered to come, have no money, or they have too much work to do.  One last thing, I have now recieved my skirt for work, so I am now wearing a skirt, If you wish to laugh go ahead. Fortuantly i may be allowed to wear trousers as we had a little talk about equal opportunities and equal rights... :D  So this is my blog, I may not blog much for the rest of the week as I will be extreemly busy finishing off coursework and doing homework. Goodbye.

       She doesn't mean disabled people driving silly. I doubt you're going to spend 1 hour in a disabled toilet, so I guess it's alright to use for a quick piss.  The sex thing: because it's mucked up, like all the other 16/18 laws.  Right, remember the Music Video thing? Well there is now a Web site for it at  urlLink www.snooboo.com/musicvideo . This is mainly directed at Paul, but everybody else is welcome to make suggestions and things.  snooboo.com Forum as well as a lot of other snooboo.com things all got mucked up while I was away, which isn't much fun.  Anywho, back to blogging; I found this on CNN:  urlLink Strangest taxes . This one is the best: Illegal drug tax: At least 11 states, including Alabama, North Carolina and Nevada, tax people who possess illegal drugs. Usually, though, you have to be in possession of a minimum quantity (for example, over 42.5 grams of marijuana in North Carolina) to be subject to the tax.  But no need to wait for the police to cuff you before you cough up the cash. In North Carolina, for instance, when you acquire an illegal drug (or even "moonshine"), you can go to the Department of Revenue and pay your tax, in exchange for which you'll receive stamps to affix to your illegal substance. The stamps serve as evidence you paid the tax on the illegal product.  Don't worry that you might get in trouble for admitting you have enough drugs to fuel a rave party for years. You needn't provide any identification to get the stamps and it's illegal for revenue employees to rat you out.  Still, according to North Carolina's department charged with collecting the unauthorized substance tax, only 77 folks have voluntarily come forward since 1990. Most of them are thought to be stamp collectors. (Or perhaps they were just high?)  The majority of the $78.3 million the state has collected thus far has come from those who got busted and were found without stamps.  But even if they had had stamps, it's not like their legal troubles would be over. "Purchasing stamps only fulfills your civil unauthorized substance tax obligation," according to the N.C. DOR Web site. Only in the strange land that we call America.

       I didn't know you had a girlfriend Dave. Who is she?  Right, answering Nicki's question about disabled people, I guess its more dangerous for a disabled person to be behind the wheel of a car than it is for them to be on a toilet. Although that said, look at how Elvis died. Toilets are dangerous creatures they are  Here's a question:  At the age of 16, you are legally allowed to have sex, yet cannot watch images of a strong sexual nature on film until you are 18. Why?

       Hiya, Nicki - Sounds great although around school shows things often get a bit tense. But as long as you can stand everyone in a stress and the boss lady thinks its ok then cool.  Paul - I have seen the way you look at me  Right, today i took out my girlfriend to Croydon, we looked in strange shops then went to pizza hut, then went to see 50 first dates, (was fairly good but was one of them typical films where you can predict the end from the start!) Then i went to her house to 'meet the parents' and i dont think i should make a comment about that so publicly. Anyway then when i got home wayne gave me a call and said do ya wanna come bowling so i said yea course. So then i had to go back to gf 'Becky's house and pick her up then we spent the evenign bowling. Just got home, didnt win, far from it. (i am sure it was a computer related problem and nothing to do with how i bowl) Anyway most of you seem to be writing short messages, and i can really go on when i want to so i think i will now finish, (you dont all wanna know about my strange and mucked up life) So looks like i am gonna watch the rest of this film (on BBC1, not bad actually, comic moments) Then go to bed, hope you are all well, and see you all tuesday!

       Yay! Hi Dave *waves*. We discovered blogger doesn't like hotmail or hotmail doesn't like blogger. One of the two. Oh yea, I had a brainstorm. When the school play is on if you want, I could always come and keep you company on the balcony..each night. Then I could like watch Paul each night....and keep you tech dudes company. Sounds like a plan to me. Your choice....  Righteho. I have work 9.30 - 1.30 today. Not sure if that is good or not. I like the fact I have been given a pay rise, that actually makes me work harder amazingly. Might run into Croydon after work to purchase some things.  Have a go at this one:  Why is it illegal to park in a handicapped parking space but its ok to use a handicapped toilet?

        HI EVERYONE  Right after approximately 1000000000000000 invites from nicki finally one has worked and i am back with you guys!  Looking through the last few posts i am fairly concerned with what i have to live up with, and hope my meaningless comments and sexual innuendos will be good enough for this sacred blogg.  My day today has been relatively boring and no where near exciting enough to mention here, overall this week for me has been absolutely brilliant and a much needed break, the amount of work i have got through and the pain and sweat i have put into all my subjects 18 hours a day has been totally and completely unbelievable. (and indeed you may choose not to believe that). Anyway i must now go and stare aimlessly at the motorola ICOM 2 way radios, because i am like that. Hope you are all having a great holiday and i will be back soon. Dave  (also known as, David, David Thomas, The new boy on the block, Sexy, sex bomb, as well as some others which will remain undisclosed)

       Some more things to educate you guys about. Goths. Did you know there are sterotypes of goths? No? Yes? I'll tell you about them anyway;   Romantic Goth   attitude: My capacity for love is certainly greater than this mortal coil can bear.  clothes: Anything with lace and frills: Edwardian, Victorian, renaissance.    Mopey Goth   attitude: Gentle people always perish in an unkind world.  clothes: romantic, modern.    Fetish Goth   attitude: Gentle people are excellent for spanking.  clothes: leather, PVC, fishnet, chains.    Perky Goth   attitude: Woohoo!  clothes: modern, fetish, cyber    Raver Goth   attitude: If it don't glow, it don't show.  clothes: phat pants, t-shirts, tank tops, flourescent thingies    Goth Geek   attitude: It's better than being a plain geek.  clothes: modern    Vampire Goth   attitude: Vampires are cool.  clothes: formal, jetset, romantic.    Pagan Goth   attitude: The occult and/or celtic religions are cool.  clothes:    Ren Faire Goth   attitude: The Renaissance Faire and role-playing games are cool.  clothes: medieval, renaissance, Scottish.    Other dark people  Deathrockers, rivetheads, metalheads, weekenders.  Just so you know.

So yesterday some of us went to Brighton which were (if you didn't know) Me, Paul, Jackie, Matt W, Dave Edwards, Char, Jenna, Jenny and Sarah.  Was lots of fun, except I got burnt. Damm the sun. I also managed to get us a bit lost but the less said about that the better... Day before that I did teh Hard Rock Cafe and theatre with Paul and omg it rocked so much and we are so doing that in the summer Paul. I'm gonna take you to see Jailhouse Rock or something. :p  Today I shall spend it working. Right now I can't do any as all my books are wet with paint and will take a few hours to dry. Wopee!!!

       In the process of looking up the anwser to this question I have discovered that the worker bee in the hive is worked to death! Outrageous! I vote we stage a revolution for them all. Mind you, what do you expect when the Queen bee kills her mother and any siblings. The 'drone' bee has it all, all HE does is mate with the Queen bee. Lucky him.  I have found out how bees have sex, read below:  The mating flight follows a pattern. The virgin queen flies to a congregation area where hundreds or thousands of unrelated drones await. The drones pursue the queen and several mate with her in flight. The drone mounts the queen, inserts his endophallus, and ejaculates his semen. During ejaculation, the male falls back and his endophallus is ripped out of his body and remains attached to the queen. Drones mounting later remove the previous drone's endophallus and lose their own through similar matings. The emasculated drones die very quickly with their abdomens burst in this fashion.   Um, interesting. And if you could see the diagrams I do then you shall see that the male bee looses his stinger. I wonder then if they do actually sting each other? So not that anyone wanted to know any of that but there you go! That is how bees have sex.

       Today was interesting. Got up at 10 and went to see Gothika with Dave/Rich/Rob and a few other people. It's a good scary film, actually makes you jump unlike some of the others. Then we went for Pizza Hut, I only had one slice of pizza because I was too full up from the large popcorn and Coke from the cinema.  Plan for the week: Tues - Homework Wed - Fix Andy's PC Thurs - See Lora Fri - Homework Sat/Sun/Mon - At Nan's. Tues - School Wed - School Thurs - University Trip Thing Fri - School.

       To Jackie: I am alright thank you. I've just worked all day for the third time since Friday. Marvellous. Now my legs ache. How are you? How is everyone?  The Meaning of life.... who says there is one? Life doesn't have a set meaning. Life is a journey, not a destination. Guess it also depends if you believe in the afterlife. If you do, the meaning of life will probably be to lead a good life. If you don't, then the meaning of life is just to makea s much of your life as you can. But nah, there is no 'meaning to life'

       The joys of England which you do not realise until you have been away. English number plates. English crows. English pigeons. English sausages. English spag bol. English language. English people in general. English rain. English chips! English shower. English home. English road. English left side driving on the English road. etc.....  I've decided from my Barcelona trip that I dislike the French, and France. Quite a lot. So its not good really when I am going on next years art trip (most likely, ie: Phillips said: of course you can come, you can do what you like) (woo!!!!) to the South Of France. Gah.   What is everyone up to this weekend? I'm working 9.30 - 6.00 today and 10.00 - 2.00 tomorrow even though we are shut. Lol.   Have a good day.

       Perhaps your not making sense with being busy yet not a lot has happened. Perhaps your overreacting. Perhaps your not being told your wrong. Perhaps people disagree but perhaps because of that it makes a discussion / debate.  Wooo! I get paid £4.20 now! Wooo!

       I got back from Barcelona yesterday. I was like yay lets go read El Bloggo and catch up with what people have been doing this past week. Jackie tided her room. Thats it.  Thanks for blogging everyone. Your really keeping up the point of a group blog. I'm going to now invite some random people to join this so tough if you don't like them or whatever, its not as if anyone has given any suggestions. I'm going to invite:  Dave T (give him a re-try), Paul, Andy See how they work with this and then maybe some more depending how many people actually blog.  For now; I had a good time in Barcelona. Not that anyone has really asked. Except Paul. Then again I did see him yesterday. Or Matt. He asked. Thats about it really.

       Hiya, Feeling beeter today, my best mates birthday, had a bit of a party was good fun, chance to losen up a bit. Thanks alot of depriving me of my exam time relief PAUL, grrrrr i was really looking foward to that extra week!!! Glad you finally found a bus anyway. I remain annoyed with pennie, but am genrally happier now so its all good. Hope you all had a good bank holiday, and i hope you all have a good week.  Talk to you all soon, Dave

       I see what you are saying Dave. I have noticed that they never come to the commmon room anymore to see everyone. Look back to year 11 and how big the groyup of friends. How when people organised the park just about everyone went. This year I have hardly seen Pennie. When I do she is with Stuart and they never part so I don't get any time to talk to her. I see Helen in textiles, when she turns up.  I would've gone down yesterday but I didn't finish work until 4.30ish and it was raining at the time. I also rang Pennie to check they were there and they had moved from the park into Helens shed. I had asked Pennie the day before to text me if they left the park so I knew where they were. That has annoyed me alot. She never remembers to tell me if they are somewhere else, or if she can't make it etc... I find it really rude.  But hopefully in the summer we can all down the park and if everyone mucks in in sending out the emails and stuff we'll all get there. Just I guess now we gotta work around when people are actually at work.  Talking of work. I'll be working today from 9 until 6 so if anyone feels like a walk come on up to woolies and buy yourselves some Cd's or sweets or toys or stationary or kitchenware. You know you want to. Actually you don't have to. Lol. In fact I want you all to stay home and have a lie in and have fun.  Have a nice day.

       Deep Dave, deep. We didn't go in the end, because they'd all wandered off by the time I finally made it there. I did start walking by the way, or running anyway, and a bus came and picked me up eventually :)  By the way Dave, I owe you an apology, I was wrong about the extra week, there isn't one. Looks like its time to start those drama notes now old chap!

       Hi, I did go to the park, and it did chuck it down with rain, and i didnt stay long, and today taught me something.  It dont matter how much money you have or what you can do in life, friends are f****** important to everyones happieness and those who dont have them are sad people. Pennie and Helen used to be popular people, but although they spent alot of money tried hard and pulled out all the stops to make today good, they simply dont have enough people who care about them to make it a sucess. If more people were there it would have been fun, they have thought about themselves too much this year and have ended up in an unfortunate situation (mainly pennie). Today has made me realise how important my friends are to me, especially my best friend and other close friends i have around me. I urge you all to think about your friends, and next time your having some 'huge argument' stop and think, why weaken or lose a friendship. No one can have too many friends, Just a thought. Talk to you all soon, hopefuly i will be able to come to the cinema on Wednesday. See you all soon, Dave

       I was going to go down the park, but I have decided against it, as it looks like its gonna chuck down with rain. Secondly I have a cold. Thirdly I would have to walk down by myself carrying a big teddybear. Fourthly the park gets boring after a few hours anyway.

       Max, could you not say 'Jesus Christ' in the sense that you do? You use it like as an insult and I think that is really disrespectful. Fine if you don't believe in it all but its being disrespectful to others.  If your going to the park don't forget to come into Woolies on your way down (if your walking) and come and buy your sweets and stuff. Yay!

       About the date: This is the one it is set on. The only others are in just number fomr or May 2004 etc.. There are no other day and month ones so its just this. I really don't think it makes that much of a difference.  I am: Lirit Choiseul, Nemesis of The Lost - A lonely one who guides the lost - but not to safety, to their doom.

       Well we can't go back to the old layout and I think this one works well. Yea the advertis annoying but it doesn't exactly spoil the whole site and I am happy with it.   General Studies was allright, I managed to anwser every question. Got 3 hours of geology today, not happy about that at all. I have been revising shockingly but none of it is sinking in so I most likely will fail this exam.  Great.  Good luck with CT everyone, good luck with any other exam you have this week.

       HI, I am not sure if i prefer the new or old layout, I had a good day off today, when of course i should have had a good day doing critical thinking revision. It looks like i will be made to re-take that next year, (whats the chances of me getting A-C)  Anyway, whish you all luck with all your exams, anyone like me needs all the luck they can get their hands on. Talking of what you can get your hands on, anyone see the  10:30 ITV news    Croydon high school , which is litrally a stone throw away from my house was on there, as well as  john ruskin college  and  other selsdon schools , because a load of kids in this area have stolen exam papers before the exams, piles of papers have been found on the streets of selsdon, and where was i during all this sudden media attention in the selsdon area, IN KENLEY !!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Oh well one day i will be on TV, one day i will be a star! Talk to you all soon, Dave

       Morning everyone, Lots of changes to alert you to. First of all we have a new layout of: Tic Tac Blue as requested. Enjoy guys. Please keep your profiles updated. I can't figure out how to delete archives because I thought it'd be good to almost start again, ie: with the new template start new archives. However can't find this option so gonna have to have all the old posts as well which isn't too bad but remember (this goes to everyone) they are old posts from the past when things were different and before we grew up over the summer. Some people may get that more than others.  Um. Ok so that is the main change. LOL.  Sorry I couldn't make it to bowling, had to work all day and then do revison (forced to by parents, gah). I hope you had a good time.  General Studies today, should be a giggle NOT. 2 and half hours. Yipee. 3 hours geology tomorrow. Pants.  Hope you all have good day!

Went dog racing last night, i won some and lost some, but end of the night, i came home with £12 less than i went with! It was a bit of a laugh. I really hope loads of people turn up on sunday, will be more exciting/challenging. But i am not a competitive person (lol hehe lol)  Glad to hear that everyone is revising as hard as i am, look foward to seeing as many of you as possible tommrow.

       Work this weekend. Gah. Nice weather though. Yay! Dave I shall see what I can do but I doubt I'll be able to make seeing as I have no idea where it is. I'll talk to Lora, see how she is getting there. If I do come obviously I'll be late.  Have a nice weekend dudes, when on study leave those of us who usually go down park - maybe we should do that again? Sit under the tree, do sod all all day, be childish on slide. Lol. And whoever else wants to come should come!

       Yeah, everyone seems to be borrowing pirate equipment off of moi :b According to a few people, I look alright in a bandana, if I have it underneath my hair? I dunno, maybe I'll try it out a bit.  I'm listening to Run by Snow Patrol. Marvellous. I'm also very wet, cos I've just got back from doing my paper round, where the heavens decided to open. Am also a tad stressed about impending exams and whatnot, but should be OK... first one is Critical Thinking on Tuesday.  Gah, I'm gonna be at school virtually all half time rehearsing for the school play. Bah.

       I'll see what I can do Dave but I doubt I'll be able to get there before 3!! Still have to go home, get changed, eat and get there. I will probably get out of work late, usually do.  I'm on my second day of the art exam and its going horribly wrong. Explain more another time. Paul came over yesterday after school which was nice to see him :) He loverly. The quiz was amusing, we came second to last. Woo!! Some of the costumes were pretty cool. Adam Ant. What a giggle. And then all the nurses. Lol.   I am listening to the Bohemian Rhapsody. Love it. *big grin*.  I shall change the layout at the weekend most likely. Should be good.

       Hello Everyone, Nicki - If you finish at 2, you can still come a bit late if you want, loads of people are gonna be a bit late anyway. Max - Glad to hear you can come, i am trying to get Lora to come, but she has the same problems as Nicki Tom - If you can please let me know if you can come, cheers  Ok, Yesterday i went out for this meal, started with the theory that i had a physics exam in the morning (eg. this morning) so i wouldnt drink anything alcholic. It didnt last long,First of all i was joking around with the waitress and she guessed that i was 18/19 so i said yea i am, she then insisted on buying me a drink, and once you start you cant stop. I drunk far too much, i remember getting into the car with a beer and telling my dad that i hadnt been drinking at all. I wasnt the most drunk out of us 4 though so it could have been worse. I came in for the exam this morning, on time, but with sun glasses and a sore head!!! Still the exam went better than i expected, so that is good. I will not be in school tommrow. But i wilil be on friday. Please encourage others to come on sunday. I dont really care who comes, (you all know who i like and who i dont!) Look foward to seeing you all soon, Text me if you wanna know anything, Dave

       Happy Birthday Dave, I hope you have a great day!  Last night Paul and I went to see 'The Passion Of The Christ'. Very  very  powerful and moving film. I won't go on because I am sure you guys do not want to hear about my religious babble. Thank you for the invite Dave but on Sundays if I am not working all day I finish at 2. So can't come. Sorry.   General Studies exam: was ok. Missed a few of the sciency / mathy questions out but I anwsered the 40 mark one with tons of waffle. That usually works for me.  Template: I'll wait for votes from Max, Paul and Jackie before I decide weather we change or not. I think we may as we have had this layout since the blog begun.

       Pretty much every other single school in the country has sent their lower sixth off on study leave, apart from ours. Eliot's solution* to this is not to turn up to school unless he feels like. Quite right too.  Happy birthday David, it is officaly the 18th of May, so you are now 17. Hurah.  General studies exam? Well, err, I haven't a clue, I just wrote lots of crap.   * Max: You're probably looking at this and thinking that I've got an aprostophe there where I shouldn't have. Well I should, because the solution 'belongs to' Eliot, you use an apostrophe to indicate this.

       Dave, thanks for the invite. I think I can come sunday! :D  I was sick yesterday 5 times. Lovely. Was going to take the day off school BUT NO, I couldnt risk failing business studies and general studies for the sake of one day's work. Anyway I felt fine.  General studies exam was okay, I reckon a C/maybe low B. How did you guys/girls do?  Night.

       Hi, It seems like i am talking only to myself but i need to talk, i am in that kinda mood. I had my first driving lesson today, !!! YAY !!! I have the same driving instructur as Tom and Paul, the lovly Alison. I had 2 hrs or 2X 50 mins, i did loads, i can already do gears 1, 2 and 3, all the stearing business, i drove round cones, i stopped, did skid control, (as part of the stopping procedure) Also something exciting happened!!! the hook from a glider came falling to the ground towards our car! On Alisons say so, we quickly moved away from the landing site!!!! could have been a problem. anyway, it was great and i am happy, on monday we go drive in sandersted!!! at 11, so i advise you tell your parents to keep off the road between 11 and 12 on monday.  Apart from driving it is my birthday, or will be in 2 hrs and 20 mins, i got my pressies this evening, some cloths and driving stuff, main present being the driving lessons. I also got some money from distant relatives etc etc etc. Urm, tommrow i am going out for a meal with wayne, and both our girlfriends, so that will be nice.    SUNDAY BOWLING AMF 2 O'CLOCK  All of you lot are invited, and all your partners, (or potential partners, or whoever!) its kinda for my birthday but i am leaving it fairly open and everyone pays for themselves. Tell other people and stuff. Right i think i better go do some work and stuff. See you all soon, Hope you all well, Good luck with all the exams and stuff, Dave

       Tom and Dave, no need for jibes on here ok. I am sure you are both working hard weather you have an extension or not.  I worked a full day at woolies today. It was, in the words of Paul, 'filthily' hot in the store. I brought some chocolate after we shut and it was soft! I know last summer it was hot enough for the chocolate to have melted. It all had to be sent back because apparently you could hold up a bad of chocolate and see it in almost liquid form. Yucky. Oh yes I am looking forward to working over summer.  I managed to slice my hand 3 times with scissors today while ripping up boxes. Owee. They sting a lot.   Other news in my world; I have convinced mother to allow me to dye my hair, but only when I am 18 which is good. Better than the normal NO I get. LOL.   Those who don't run their own blog the urls for the templates are as follows, please tell me which you prefer if you have a preferance:  urlLink No.897   urlLink Snpashot Tequila   urlLink Tic Tac Blue

       Hi, I am having great fun, on my 'MEDIA WEEKEND' and just to annoy tom, i have now completed all of my research stage for video and radio! and by the end of the day i will have done a significant chunk of the pre-production stage too!!! So in a way i am happy, but its alot of work. Anyway, i got up really later yesterday and did media, then Becky (the gf) took me out for a candlelit meal for my birthday, she brought me Hugo Boss aftershave (the new and improved david now more irrasistable than ever before) so that is nice. and she brought me a big glittery card, also her parents brought me a card (From them) (is that strange???) so i got home at 00:30 this morning and slept for a while, up nice and early to do this media, am now having a short break, and a BBQ in a bit. Then back to work. I hope your all well, and we will do something soon, i am thinking i wanna take people bowling next weekend, maybe sunday. what do we think? good idea? Anyway work to be done, speak to you all soon, Good luck tom, Dave

       Awww. Well I am at work all day today. Woo. Um, still got 1 essay to write plus a evaluation for textiles and my art prep to do as well as get ready for gen stu exam tomorrow. Anyone know details for it? When? Where? I missed my last lesson due to textiles exam so meh.  Um, I'm all injured. My neck is killing me when I look down so being on the till today won't help at all. Its partly the way I sleep, I sleep in a funny position and also partly due to stress. I have noticed how when I am very very stressed some limb or something hurts. The other week I couldn't breath properly because my ribs were hurting. Now its my neck. Ack.  Tom blog bitte. :)

       Well not much to write about other than the fact I have now finished all my courseowrk so far. Unless I get set anymore. Friday was a good day for me as I only had one proper lesson, My revision is not going well as I find it physically impossible to revise but meh...  General studies should be fun... Scientific domain... Argh, its gonna suck so badly, we have been doing practice papers and they are impossible! Because its the scientific domain I get to miss the next general studies lesson we have cause I'm doing scientific domain at the moment...  Yes, I have no work to day, good job too because shortly I will be venturing outside to top up my tan... If the sun is still out that is!  I will be tidying my room today as it looks like a mass of papers and clothes... Shouldn't take me that long. I'm also going to the library.  Thats about it from me. I might update a bit later if someone else blogs.

I know I am doing Science paper.Er...Monday evening I'm going to see The Passion Of The Christ as hinted at by Starky as I am doing that in Art. I think Paul is coming but he is still deciding. Um.

       Today I proved to Beckett that his car has fluffy steering.  Proper steering is what they have in real cars like Jaguars and Aston Martins. Beckett seems convinced that fluffy steering was part of a man's car, and all these nice cars have rubbish steering. (Before any of you have a go at me, I am aware that Beckett can't get a Jaguar, the point I'm making is that he thinks his steering is the best and that proper steering is boring.)  Proper steering is the one where you can feel the road as you go round tight corners. Fluffly steering is when you require very little effort to turn the wheel; fluffly steering is also when you can turn the wheel from full left-lock to full right-lock without moving the car.  I successfully proved him wrong by driving around the car park using my pinky finger only on the steering wheel, then turn the wheel right round without moving the car (doesn't did the tires any good, but I was proving a point dammnit!).  He later proved himself wrong by driving around that tight corner on the Caterham by-pass, only with his pinky finger on the steering wheel.  Thomas 1, Beckett 0.

I'm just sitting at school listening to The Rasmus, I've taken James iPod again.. He has the album on there, so hehe.  I'm bored, everyone else has gnoe down the shops but I couldn't be bothered to go dwon there...  I have another 2 hours before my next lesson.

       Slightly confused at first but I am liking it now. I was just looking at the templates, does anyone what the layout changed? Or are you all happy with how it is now?  I have my textiles exam in two days. Ahhhh.  I have to go and find Mr Hogg today and have a stern word with him. Which will probably end up in him having a stern word with my form tutor but I am very upset about what he said to me yesterday so grrr.

I really enjoyed myself, another fab party from Andy - nice one! Found it hard to pull myself out of bed. No hangover for me, I didn't drink that much. Can't help but laugh at Matt W, I bet when he got up today he felt awful. Tsk tsk. Well I enjoyed myself and can't wait to party with Paul and Neil etc... again.

       HI, Welcome to Saturday. Just got home from Andys. It was great fun, had a really good time, and have some good photos. Ever the rain couldn't spoil the mood and atmosphere, well done to Andy for yet another, highly successful and well organized party. Although there is already things about the party I am regretting, doing/saying. Generally it was brilliant and nice to let my hair down 'as they say'. One word if anyone don't know what to talk about LEE. You could write a book on every day of his weird and mucked up life. It scares me. Talk to you all soon, Have a great weekend. Dave

       Errrr probably jeans and tshirt and light jacket. Everyone always gets really hot when on the castle and stuff.   So I only just got in from school. Spent past 2 hours drawing a man, naked. He was naked not me. It was quite good, he was talking to us before and he did the poses we needed. He did the pose of the crucifiction of Christ. It was really good. I did some good pictures. Nakedness. Gah. Unless its Paul :p  Err what else. Oh yea I can't breath properly, My whole rib cage hurts, mainly on the left side. I'm kind of worried. It REALLY hurts to breath. And no one else is in so I can't ask mother what to do. Gah. Maybe I'll just die. Or not. Rather not.

       Well... Not much to blog about, hense why I haven't blogged.  If I have not already said, I might be getting a trampoline, I just have to convince my dad it's a good idea and that it won't ruin his grass... I measured the garden and it is just big enough for a 12ft trampoline. So that's the one I will be getting if I can convince my dad.  I am looking forward to Andy's party, it should be fun. I have a question though:   What is everyone wearing?   I stayed after school today and did some work, I also played a game of pool with Laura. We started playing thinking there was no white ball so we were using the black ball, only for an upper 6th person to say, why arn't you using the white ball? We were like Dohhhh  Umm, yea thats about it.

       OK so I was only in school for first 2 lessons today then I went to London with Scott and James (Maragone) to do arty stuff like visit the Tate and St Pauls. Well well well. 1) James decided to cross the road at a non crossing point and we were nearly run down by a motorcyslist 2) while walking over the milliemememen bridge there was this HUGE fork of lightening the next bridge over so we stood to watch then realised we were on a metal bridge so promtly left 3) standing outside St Pauls and it starts to hail reeeeeeeeeeally heavily so all 3 of us squished into a phone box and then there was this huge FLASH and lightening struck St Pauls right next to us 4) on way through croydon James decided to run across the tram track and nearly got us run over  Thats 4 times I nearly died today. *cries*

       Good morning ya'll. Hope your plans for the day are full of sleep and rest or in Pauls case working but getting lots of dosh!!!! :p I am offt o bluewater today, kinda annoyed I had to get up early. Ate out last night and will be eating out today so I'm gonna be fat on Monday. I am pondering buying some kind of excerise thingy. I like rowing machines but too expensive for me. Um what else. Oh yea blue fans are really bitchy. I made a post on the official blue forum to say I was selling some blue singles etc.. an dthey are all replying going 'omg how can you sell them i'd treasure them forever'. I'm like helloooooooooooo I am trying to help some of you out here! Idiots.    If you could spend a month doing whatever you want, going whereever you want where would you go and why and what would you do?

       Sorry to hear you not so happy Dave :( oh :(  how is it fair that your best friends are the people who can hurt you the most?  because you put all your faith and trust in that one person so if they do something weather its intentional or not it will hurt ten times more than from any otyher. It's life, it sucks but it happens. You just got to be careful about who your closer friends are.  and why is it that their mums always need you to go and fix their computers?  no idea!  and finally what do you say to someone who has been given a month to live? You don't say anything. Sometimes they live a lot longer than that one month. You spend teh next month giving them good memories, taking them places or just being all that you can be for them. You just gotta try and make them happy so they don't regret their last month or so. Hope its all ok :) Btw Dave when is your bday?  Sorry this is short would write more about my amazing day at Woolies but must dash off to Gatwick. See you all soon!

       Hello everyone, my long weekend isnt quite going to plan and isnt anywhere near as enjoyable as i had hoped it would be. Just one question for you all today, how is it fair that your best friends are the people who can hurt you the most? and why is it that their mums always need you to go and fix their computers? and finally what do you say to someone who has been given a month to live?  They are three questions i asked myself yesterday, hope your all having fun, see you soon. Dave

        W00T!  I finally have all my money for the eMac. Will cash the last of it in Tuesday, and wait til the 12th/13th May for it to be delivered.  Had my group interview at Waitrose today, went quite well........Matt.B is lucky - they get like 10% of their wages every year bonus - as well as 50% off ANY external class you take - for example, if I was to take guitar lessons, Waitrose will pay 50% of it! W00T!  Byebye.

       HIYA, I like your description paul, most informative, and imaginative. I have been at school this evening doing stuff for stagecoach, i dont mind too much becuase i get paid for all that. Anyway i am suffering from sleep deprevation, actually it feels like in the night when my body is trying to go to sleep, a team/army of small ompa-lompa type beings is creeping into my room, picking me up and taking me to several amusment establishments, where i am forced onto a vast amount of high intensity rides, after which i do one lap of the world (running) after which i am thrown out of an airoplane traveling at extream veloicity (without a parachiot) i would then land in the sea and have to swim the length of the atlantic, followed by many a hungry shark back to my bedroom, where the seemingly nice small people would tuck me in and leave me there to awake in the morning feeling like the night never happened. So thats that out the way. See you all soon, Dave

       I shall tell you all what my throat feels like. It feels like someone has ripped it out, and thrown it into the woods, whereupon a tiger has found it. It has taken it home, and fed it to it's 3 little tiger cubs, who have mauled it for a period of 18 days. Then, a hunter comes and shoots the tigers, and manages to accidentally shoot my throat four times in the process, picked it up, ran it through the blender 7 times, dipped it in acid, rubbed it down with sandpaper, and then returned it to me. Gah.

       The Tempest is over now which is quite sad. I kinda wish it was still going on, although it is nice to have my life back a bit. Well done again to everyone :)  What is everyone doing for work shadowing / experience? I'm not doing it. I am using my costumey stuff from the shcool play and shall go into school on Thursday to do textiles all day as I have alot to catch up on. Eek.   I'm stupidly tired.

       I also was extreamly pleased with how last nights show went, and all potential 'situations' were defused so thats all good. Looking foward to doing it all again tonight, however it always gets a bit sad knowing that months of work and time and effort has gone into this show and now its finishing. Oh well, i am still happy, see you all soon.  Dave

I am so proud of everyone involved including the techies and very proud of Paul.  Well done to everyone and I look forward to being back tonight. I am sure tonight will be just as good if not better.  For now I must go off to work, wopee.

I look forward to seeing you all there. Won't be able to hang around after though but I will be back on Saturday evening to open doors.  Jackie cinema Sunday, 8.10 I think it was? Or 8.15?

       First show was indeed good, hoping the next two will be even better though  Was a tad disappointed by the football result, but ah well, we'll get another chance in two years, so never mind, eh?  I'm not entirely sure how friendly the atmosphere will be backstage tonight. Certain members of the tech crew, and a certain actress may very well be a bit difficult to work with. Ah well, here's hoping it goes OK *fingers crossed*

       HIYA First show tonight and it went really really well, couldnt have been better. So it is not in my mind surprising that the evening ended with a punch up. Nothing is ever 100% perfect. But the show was great and definatly worth you all seeing, matt write watched it today and loved it! See you all soon, Dave

No idea why Tom hasn't blogged so could you blog please Tom? Thanks :)  I've been helping out with the production for the Tempest, I've been doing costumes and set and stuff so wheeeeeeeeeeeee! Yay :) The show is looking great, really good acting with some great sounds and lighting in it so come and see! tickets on sale from the box office at break times. Students are £4.00. It rocks.

       Thought I'd pop in and say Hi.  Haven't really been up to much lately although I had a successful shopping trip yesterday. I counted up my DVD's and I have 29... All brought from WHSmith and since November! I shall be buying the Scary movie box set when I get payed as I can't afford it until then. I'm working tonight and so am bunking off last lesson, I'm then working all day saturday...  Means lots of money when I get paid! Yay!  Nicki about the cinema, when do you want to go? Just chat to me on msn or something...  I won't be on the internet much tonight as I'm working till about 8, won't get home until at least 9pm... Then I have a exam tomorrow, so will have to revise. Of course I probably won't revise...  Parents have got tickets to Wimbledon, so they have gone off there today. But I think it will rain so they probably won't see much play, which is a shame really as the ticket are quiet expensive. I heard they are seeing Venus Willaims and some other well known dude. I just can't think of the name right now. there is also some other random person that knocked Hennman out of the French open so they are seeing some good amtches considering its the opening day. they are on number one court I belive so that's also good!  Well. that's my blog for a while. Blog agin in a few days/ weeks!

       Yesterday I went up to Caterham and got my Dad the prezzies. Played CounterStrike for the rest of the day. Todat was spent doing my CompTIA A+ course and doing some ICT homework. CounterStrike at night, obviously.  Next week will be interesting. Parents are away from tuesday til Friday night! W00T! Having the whole house to myself.  Pah, I have to go in on inset day to do an exam. Sucky.

Past 2 days I have been mostly in textiles room helping to do the tye dying for the school play next week. Its pretty tiring but they need it done. next Wednesday I am doing the textiles stall for the induction days along with Megan and someone else, maybe Helen? Should be interesting and hey we get to dress up smartly!  Work today until 1.30 then going up to school to get T-shirts to bring home and finish off. Going to see Charlenes play tonight with Paul :). Working all day tomorrow.   What is everyone upto this weekend?

       Pah, the BB row was just like the usual Saturday here when my Dad comes home from work. Nothing TOO special, except the table going over and the tin foil tray.  Anyhow, 2 x £1.58 has been charged to my bank account without me saying so......contacting the bank on Tuesday to sort it out.  As for A-Levels, I am sticking to what I did last year. I will probably take General Studies A2. Might as well, 3 lessons a fortnight and a whole A2 for it. General Studies does suck though...but I think I can tolerate it for another year.  Fathers Day Sunday.........what have we all got em'? I haven't purchased anything yet, but i'll give him a massive bar of Cadburys choc and a new shirt (as his old one is all worn round the collar).

       I don't tend to watch BB that much, just on a random basis. I watched it last night and thought what a bunch of losers. All the fighting and stuff its just like oi, you fools, grow up. Although I supose makes it interesting to watch although I kinda got bored of it after a while. But yea. No riots in Croydon last night, good. Just lots of people. So its good when England win because the hoodlums stay away. Woo!  First day back at school everyone? How'd it go?  I thought it was ok. I was very very tired though. What is everyone doing for September, dropping any subjects or taking up any?

Still, will be cool to get on with some ICT A level style, ahem! yeah right, bunking time i think...  Still, very tired now, so earlyish night, its already gone 11 so night night all, and see you tomorrow, though by the time you've read it I will have seen u already! CRAZIE! Andy

       Hiya everyone, On the footbal front its really not my thing. People shouldnt riot, but those who do know what they are getting themselves into, i think they should all be locked up. Maybe we need to build a prision in Croydon, maybe in the new Central centre. Drama exam was ok, had to stay at school keep an eye on the lights, got home about nine, some of the art was to a really good standard this year, well done everyone, however i must now urge all art and textiles students to remove their work, as soon as possible, or it will be removed for them, we have a show to do!!!  Talk to you all soon, see most of you tommrow, Dave

       I don't see how they can be good at what they do. Its just kicking a ball round and keeping fit. Doesn't really require much skill. I admit if you put me there I'd suck but then again I suppose if you practise to the extent and all that they do then yea you would be better than others but I really cannot see the skill or talent involved. I know its a part of the police's job to deal with rioting but I don't see why people need to turn around and have a go at the police when all they are doing is trying to stop the rioters damaging too much property and from injuring other people.  I tend to get really pissed off when people slag off the police which if what hooligans and such do because they are doing their job. Its not like they go out of their way to spoil their fun or whatever, its their job as you say and I wish that people would think twice before doing something which can injure or kill a police officier, what about their families and such? Shame people don't think much these days.

       It's fair enough to have an opinion but a few of the things u mentioned I disagree with. It doesnt suck, it is a bunch of overpayed kids i agree, but they are bloody good at what they do.  The riots and alcohol stuff is a bit o.t.t because those thugs will get pissed and fight about anything, when theres no world cup, they'll fight over a bloody ham sandwich!  The policemen bit.  Its their job, though it sounds harsh, but it is their job.  My mum and dad enjoyed their time in the police but it wasnt the easiest job they ever had.  My dad was quite often wrestling 7 foot south african burgalars, and he didnt always come out on top!  BTW, Im not having a go... :)  Its nice every two years to have a tournament of the countries favourite game.  Apart from that, Im working loads stil, not enjoying all of it, but hey, its money. Will see you all tomorrow :)  Still, best of luck to England, and speak soon to y'all

       Well football in my opnion sucks. I really don't like the game itself and I have made the effort and watched a match before but I find it incredibly pointless because in my opinion its some guys kicking a ball into a net which doesn't actually require that much talent. I like footie when your playing it with your mates and its just a laugh but anything bigger, no thanks. Give me a good ol game of rugby, a bunch of lads with a ball. Simelar to footie in that aspect but there are many more ways of scoring etc... And that really is talent, just look at Johnny Johnny Johnny Wilkinsons lastkick. Yuss! Although lately I have become a bit partial to cricket. I love it. Woo! The barmy army, love em!! So back to why I hate football. I hate the world cups and stuff because you get all the football hooligans which I know isn't everyone but it seems to be most people and then they have to go off and get pissed and get into fights (something riugby goers do not do, a game I went to the fans simply shook hands said good game then wandered off happy as bees) just take Croydon as an example. 400 fans in Croydon, riot. Smash windows etc..., surrounded a tram. 15 or so policeman were injured. Thanks a lot, what if that had been my dad working that night? Luckily he wasn't but he could be next time. I see why people drink alcohol at games but there is no need to drink that amount that causes rioting. I mean, what exactly were they rioting about?? The fact we lost? well we still have 2 games left and even if we lose oh well, theres always next time.

       The football was quite disappointing, although I was so knackered that day I spent most of it asleep. I like football when it's the World Cup and stuff, cos of the massive levels of patriotism, which is cool.... I've been trying to work out what it is about football that makes it our country's most popular sports..... anyone help me on that one?  Anyway, on a more academic note, last exam today, Drama, then a rehearsal for the Tempest, and then FREEDOM!!! .... until tomorrow that is

       35 hours of over time so far in One Week!! How are we all?  Sorry Ive not been around to chat much, been living at sainsbury's!  Im gonna get a hoomungus pay check! Can't wait!  I wasn't happy about Englands football game.  I know no one is a big footie fan, but if you saw the game you will understand!  We were beating France, the competition favourites, and they scored two goals in less than a minute to win it!  bastards :(  Still, Im thinking of organising a get together somewhere, somehow.  So after nine gruelling hours of sainbury's, 3 on trolleys in this blooming heat I'm rather sweaty so I am now off to take a bath!!! see you all soon :)  Andy

What I would give for spending all that time collecting trollys rather than having abuse shouted at me via the idiotic hoodlums that hang around outside Woolies. Gah. Anyways, Nicki Johnson (Jen's sis) sent me a pic from her leavers ball trhough. Awww, I wish i could do our leavers ball all over again. Lol. It was so much fun. I love limos. When I'm older I shall buy one. And a driver to drive me around all day. Woo! Limo are cool. It was really good that night. I'm sure our sixth form one will be good as well, if not better? But then again, in year 11 you have your friends around you who you have known for years whereas now people like Angela etc.. have gone off somewhere else. Oh :(

       Hey all, sainsbury's sucks!  why can't they get trolleys that put themselves away when the customer finishes with it, rather than have some poor sod like me take 5 full hours to put them all away, finishing at half bloody ten!!  Still, I took a half hour brake so ner ner nikiniki ner ner sainsbury's!!  I did 6 and a half hours tills yesterday, well 3, i spent the rest of the time putting things on the shelves that the customers decided they didnt want when they got to the checkout!  I also had to buddy someone, means I'm good at my job!!!  They wanted me to watch over someone who was new and hepl them out if they got stuck, coolio or what!  Doing gardening today, sorting out Annie's Kennel.  She's gonna have a big bush going around it, talking of big bushes, has anyone seen The Mighty Boosh on BBC 3?  its VERY funny, and I recommend it,  its on most nights at 8 or half past.  Other than that all is well, looking forward to having a big reunion on thursday!  I wonder what the dress code will be this time!  beach wear, ski wear, posh, we'll see.  I know theres not many exams left but for those who do have some, again I wish you all the best of luck, and for those of you get back from the physics exam this eveing, I hope it went well!!  Brazil Night is a bit of a cock up, theres loadsa of jobs that need doing and I'm not sure we have enough people coming.  Hopefully it'll work out when the meetings start up again. If anyone has anything which could be given as a raffle prize that they don't want, or that can be brought for a small price, let me or Tom know!  Chow for Now, love and all the rest of it...

       Jackie is taking a break I spoke to her on msn about it. David there isn't a general feeling for you to leave. Lets now just forget about that and move on ok?  So today working 10 til 4.30. The word gah springs to mind but as it is such a nice day hopefully most folk will be at home sun bathing or something and won't have the energy to enter a store like ours which has no air conditioning so we all boil every day. Last summer it was so hot the chocolate melted. As in you could pick up a packet and it would literally be liquid form. I brought Rolocoaster Tycoon 2 yesterday. If anyone has it do you know how to delete a scenario you create? Lol. Any other news for you all? Um. Not at the moment. Oh yea schol play is in a couple weeks so come see! I am going on the Thursday with Matt W so if any of you wanna come please do. (Paul, Charlene, Becky, Helen, Pennie etc.. are in it)  Other than that have a nice day.

       Hiya, Wooooooo, everyone is very stressed, i am sorry to see you leaving jackie, and would like to apolagise for offending you, if this is what i did. Everyone else, calm down, if it is the general feeling that you all WANT me to leave, i will, just let me know. Hope you are all well, (i suppose i should have just lied, and said that everything was fine, but i dont like lieing) Dave

       Okay........just read the last 10 blogs or so.......right.  Anyhow - Andy - V.Cool news! Where are you practising your drumming? Gonna get a drum kit soon? I think I will get my guitar in a few weeks.....yeah!  The rest of my holid......sorry, "study leave" will be spent playing CounterStrike, as I have nothing to do. My final exam is Thursday in about 10 days time. Business finance - whoop-de-doo.  ICT was okay - Paper 1 being easier than Paper 2. Some questions were a bitch. Combined with the coursework, I reckon I got a C, maybe a B. Just have to wait til August!  Ciao.

       From readin this blog I have come to the conclusion that I do not wish to be part of it anymore. David. You are the most annoying person to blog on here I have ever met. You made an arguement out of nothing. Nicki, I stand by you as all you were trying to do was sort things out. DAvid. Lay of the sarcasm and stop being a fucking arsehole basically.  Hey and goodbye Andy :)  Oh and this isn't the only reason I'm leaving. I never have anything to post about and generally I forget I'm even part of this blog. You can leave me on if you wish and I will poist once in a blue moon. But for the time being I don't want to be part of it.

       hey davie.  Thank you for the kind words :) Had a hair cut, as i said earlier. SHORT! No windsurfing though, the wind would have been good! I did however buy Joss Stone's new album.  very cool.  I got The New Breed as well, proper bo. Searching for drumming lessons, found one in warlingham and one in croydon, prices are VERY high, so I'm basically being as tight as a fat mans pocket and going for the cheapest one! I stink so im gonna go shower! chat soon ya?

       Wel Dave heres why I say that. I started up this blog and I invited people to join and blog with me which they all have. Good. Now, this means that as I run it (not that there is alot to do) I just try and keep people blogging. Thats basically all I do. I could've quite easily deleted yours and Toms posts and left it blank or I could've edited them but I didn't. Instead I left you both a message trying to stop an argument escalating which is what it seemed like and instead you turn around and start yelling at me. I do not appreciate that especially after I invited you back a second time to rejoin El Bloggo. Now if you want to discuss this any further email, msn or phone me. I am sure no one else wants to read which is most likely plastered as a petty argument. Enough.  Hi Andy, glad you could join. If anyone wants to Andy Mr Woodcock here was the cause of a HUGE queue in Woolies today. He didn't have enough money so ran out to get some (this is the second time this has happened) and caused a great big queue. Tutt tutt. Lol. Silly boy. But you do keep us amused. Yea work wasn't that great as I wasn't in the best of moods. I ended up realphabetising the drawers as some people can't spell properly and keep putting the cd's in the wrong places. Gah. No big dramas. All day tomorrow. Off to Croydon now to buy a PC game and to say hi to Paul. Have a nice day ya'll.

       Hiya, Nicki - I am sorry for being responsable for your happy mood going drastically downhill. That was not what i had aimed to do, but one thing, stop being so padantic and masterful over 'YOUR BLOG' WHICH YOU OWN PERSONALLY. No one likes that. Just calml down a bit and everything will be ok. Its nice to hear from you Andy, and nice to see you chose to blog, and didnt get a detention or solatry confinment from the 'master of the blog' the 'supreme leader of us all'. I hope everyone who went had a good time at 'Harry Potter' and i once again apolagise for not being able to make it. I hope you are all well and enjoying the rather 'heated' discussions, of late.  Talk to you all soon, Dave

       Hey all, it is I, Andyrew. How are you all?  Long time no see for a lot of you! Tom, Max, how was the ICT exam? How is everyone else doing with exams?  I'm done with them now, woohoo! I'm thinking of having my head attacked by a lawnmower, when you next see me it'll be short!  lovely.  Hopefully windsurfing today, should be fun.  I had no work last night!  apparently i booked holiday, cooool. Anywho, catch you all soon, and have fun blogging back! Love and stuff like that Andy

       Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry sorry David you thought that was me attacking you? If you must know I was not. That was actually me pointing out that you don't need to remind people to blog, thats what I do. Yes people have exams but I'm still trying to get people to blog at least once a week so really Dave, there is no need for you too. And I am deeply deeply troubled and sorry that I asked to chill out I mean how could I possibly have taken those posts the wrong way? I mean the fact that what you both wrote seemed to me, a innocent bystander, very sarcastic and a bit bitchy was completely my fault and I shall never never do it again. Oh dear, the consequences of my words of trying to calm you down when you did seem rather annoyed. Bad Nicki for trying to sort out nedativeness on the blog. Bad Nicki. How dare you! If you like I can demonstrate me attacking you, here we go:   First of all , you can not attack  me  for asking people to calm down when there is clearlya small upset weather or not you were joking. How the fuck am I supoosed to know that? I quote: It seems to me that the only time in which you blog, is to contradict, or genrally attack what someone else has said. -  6/10/2004 10:51:28 PM. That sounds like you are being bitchy and I care what the fuck you think about that because everyone is bitchy sometimes yes like me being bitchy and fucking pissed off right now. Ooo great start to the day huh? Thanks.   Secondly , I was only telling you to fucking relax because you got all annoyed and at this time most people need to relax anyway but bad Nicki for trying to her mates to calm down and feel better. I'll never do it again.   Thirdly , You and Tom don't clash? Fine. Fair enough. I'm not actually bothered but in that case if you are joking around together make it more clear or just don't jokily insult each other that way dumbass people like me won't get confused and try to help sort it out. Gosh I still can't believe, I was simply trying to help you out. Never again.   Fourthly , shut the fuck up about my spelling no one spells perfectly all the bloody time and usually if your writing things in a rush not everything is spelt right. Ooo how dare I say that, I bet your spelling is perfect allllll the time. And anyway don't start on all that jazz until you can blog perfectly, ie: using an I instead of i.   And Finally , I am bitchy and probably always will be.  Now I didn't have a problem with you and I don't want you to leave. I was simply trying to sort your little what appeared to me to be a tiff out so that it did not escalate into pages like this and getting people all wound up for nothing. For maybe next time instead of you being so public about attacking me you should talk to me.  Have a nice day.  Back to normal blogging.  I had begun my day quite happily. Felt fufiled by my breakfast and then I came on here to check email and whatnot to find I was being attacked as people like to put it and so now my happy mood has drastically gone downhill. Great. Have a nice day everyone.  And yes I know I could've simply either said sorry or just not replied at all but hey I'm childish and was under the impression that it was my blog to start off with and that you knwo kinda said I could try and stop people from arguing. Oh how disillusioned I am.

       Hiya, I read what you wrote nicki, I have a response:  First of all , you can not attack me for asking people to blog, and can not say that you think they should be concentrating on exams, because in the last few weeks you have written the following, 'Could everyone other than Jackie and Dave blog please? Thanks.' - 6/3/2004 04:17:22 PM 'Max could you blog please.' - 6/5/2004 08:16:51 PM  Secondly,  I do NOT need to relax, i am perfectly relaxed, and most of all, I don’t need you telling me to relax.  Thirdly,  Me and Tom do NOT clash, we are actually good friends, and just sometimes joke around having a go at each others posts, i have spoken to him and neither of us are actually offended by anything each other say. Fourthly, if you are going to attack me so publicly, use real words 'onvious'???  And Finally , I am not bitchy, nor will i ever be.  And to think the main reason i came on here this evening was to write nice things and compliment you on your art/textiles display.   If you have any further problem with me, i will not hesitate in leaving. I am sorry it has come to this nicki, maybe next time you could speak to me or something controversial like that.     Well despite that little annoyance i am actually very happy today, have had a good day, i hope everyone else is good too. See you all soon. Dave

       I set this website up as an online diary or a blog as I use the word along with so many other people around the word who also use the word blog as an online diary. This blog is an online diary not for articles etc.. unless you feel them important enough to mention when writing about you day and things. Tom no one is attacking you, everyone is just stressed and whatnot at the moment so I think we all need to relax a bit. David you need to relax. If people need to blog I'll write they need to as I usually do. But at the moment if people don't blog its fine, exams, good reason. So calm down, just blog when you want so long as you blog regulary. And please, little bitchiness. Its onvious you two clash a bit. Just calm...

       This isn't a blog, it's a diary.  Blog is an abbreviation of weblog, which is a log of what you find interesting on the web. Typicaly, you find a website or article about an issue on the web and talk about it. A group weblog is the same, only with more people.  This isn't a blog, it's a diary; seeing as everybody seems to have a problem with me at the moment I might as well not bother with it at all.

       Hi, Mr Thomas Edwards - It seems to me that the only time in which you blog, is to contradict, or genrally attack what someone else has said, normally me or nicki, maybe you are scared of the others. Anyway, as far as i am aware the general idea is that you talk about what you have been up to, and what is going on in your life. So try doing that for a bit, see what happens.  As for everyone else, hi again.  Dave

And half of my textile pieces keep falling down. Arrrrrgh. And my art work just looks awful and gah gah gah gah. I now have to go to work and next week I am helping the drama depo out with some costume stuff for the play so that will be nice and cool and it means I'll get to see Paul a bit more.

       Hi everyone, Everyone seems a bit stressed, and i know full well i am no where near stressed enough, when we were revising and doing stuff for our GCSEs i managed to be stressed very well, but this time even though they are important exams, i am not stressed, or worried, and that is bad and becuase of it i will fail at least half my As level exams, and i am not happy about that. Anyway good luck, especially to paul, stay calm paul. See you all soon, i miss you all,  byebyebyebye Dave

       Max could you blog please. No idea what you are going on about Tom and Dave.  I worked 9.00 til 5.30 today. Not much to do as we received the wrong delivery. Oh well. So I spent most of the day on a til of some sort and encountered some very very rude people. I got to throw 3 kids out of the store who then spent most of the morning shouting abuse at me.  I can't believe that though. I don't mind working at Woolies but we get abused by hooligans outside and then nick stuff and the other day they threw flour all over our stocking area out the back. Idiots. They are pathetic but cause so many problems for us.  Something is being done. We had petition going for cameras outside all the shops. I believe there is a meeting next week at like 8 in the morning for shop runners to talk about geting better security and stuff.  Its outrageous though it really is.

       Hiya, Tom - I am neither confused or dying to know more. Something you may be interested in, i bumped into mr hogg today, he has put on order for next yr, 2 more cameras and 2 more e-macs. so thats good. I did, if you havent guessed already, pop into school today, to oversee a drama rehursal,  that was good, the tempest may actually be a good show! Other than that i have had all the social dilemas and problems you normally have in a month in one day, so thats not a good thing, and now everyone has gone to sleep before i could put things right, and i hate it when that happens. Lots of chatting to do in the morning i guess.  Hope you all well and revising hard. Dave

       Hiya everyone, I just thought i should give you a bit of an update after our cinema outing this eveing. I had a good time, it was a laugh, although i do now have a significent leg injury inflicted by the charming and lovly but highly dangerous and violent LORA. Anyway, it was a good film, and good to have a night out.  I will probally spend tommrow in school, because we have a huge show to put on in 3 weeks!  Will blog properly when i find some time, hope you are all well, see you soon. Dave

       So yesterday was at work from 9 until 6. Not too bad really. Found out what the great British public like to buy on a sunny bank holiday: swingball. Woo! And black bistro sets. At £29.99. Woo!  Today I wandered into Croydon and back out again having brought like nothing apart from some more hair shampoo. LOL. Great. I am such a big spender. Haha. Paul is coming over once he finishes work so that'll be cool. Other than that I haven't done very much. I should've spent today doing revsion. But did I? No. Gah.

       I've been i'll since Saturday. Sunday was the worst day - couldn't do anything at all, including H+P's party. Anyway, after about 16 painkillers :S im beginning to feel alright today. Still unsure about coming to the cinema tomorrow but the chances are about 50/50.

       HIYA, Today was upset when i woke up at 3, i wanted to actually do some work today, grrrrr.  But then i realised that the extra week me and Paul have been discussing DOES exist, PAUL IT REALLY DOES. So i have an extra week to do drama notes, and revise. That has made me very happy! See you all soon, Dave

       Fair enough Dave. Hope ya have fun in Canada! Nice place.  Hey Max I presume you've spent most of your days playing this Counterstrike game then huh? Heehee, I've spent most of my time when I haven't been out playing Rolocoaster Tycoon 2. I'm addicted :(   Coudln't sleep last night. Thought I'd get to bed earlyish but it was so hot and then once I finally got to sleep I woke up again then went back to sleep so all in all I slept about 3 hours last night before waking up at 8.15 by the sun streaming in through my white curtains. Gah. So I'm tired.

       My week has been okay I suppose. I'm meant to see Lora sometime, but I don't know when that is.   So far I have been doing nothing over the holidays since Sunday, when I came back from my Aunts. One thing to look forward to: Bad Lads Army tonight! Best thing ITV have had on all year.   On another positive note, I managed to grab a high score of 27 kills to 11 deaths on CounterStrike, coming in first place - and far ahead of the second to top who had a score of 19 kills to 15 deaths. I'm sure you are all very, very interested in that.   Now i'm off to have lunch and to chase up Apple. They need to replace my eMac monitor due to two mini electron guns going tits up.

       Well my weekend was crazy what with work work work! *cue disney song: whistle while you work, la la la la la la laaaaa* Yea anyways....lol. Had my half day of till training yesterday. Got into an argument with my manager a bit about being allowed to do refunds. I don't want to do them, he wants everyone to do them. Had a lecture on shrinkage. Great. Um yea the new tills are fun, they are touch screen and we will go live in August at some point so if you come into woolies watch out because queues may be long what with getting to know the tills an all.  After work I popped over to Jackies to give her pressie, yay! Then went to Paul's which was fun. We played Spiderman monoolopy! Yay! It was cool. :) Today may be off to Ikea to get bedroom furni.  Dave why you break up with Becky? You two seemed cool.

       Well worked this morning so didn't open my cards and one present until about 2.30pm!  Work was boring and I was really tired, possibly because I didn't get to sleep until about 2am last night as I was so bloody hot! I went to bed at about 12.30am so I was pretty pissed off.  I got a cool card from work, they give us weird cards and I was given one about marriage, it was quite funny especially some of the notes inside... I'm now getting married tomorrow to my good buddy susanna!  I got given a School of Rock DVD from my parents, along with some money for my holiday and the money its gonna cost to get a provisional liceanse. My sister got me some stuff about driving, so that was fun! Oh yea and I got given some L plates... The rest of my "presents" was in fact money and I think it added up to about £250 all together, so not bad really! Althought its already gone down cause I owed my mum £20 and my dad £10!  Cinema last night was good, meal was nice although I was kinda annoyed because there were some people there that I don't particulary like that much. Darren pissed me off because he did nothing but smoke all night. He had like 15 cigarrettes while we were out... About 7 after the film finished and before we got on the bus home. We were on the bus along with what seemed like the whole of the old year elevens, who were all drunk and probably high. They were also eating chicken and it was making me feel well hungry! When we got off the bus a few people got off after us and as we walked off home a fight broke out behind us, don't really know who was involved and didn't stick around long enough to find out. Stupid really because it probably ruined their night out!  Nicki, that's fine if you wanna come round Monday, just give me a more direct time as I have to check I'm not working! I don't think I am... But you never know!  I'm gonna shut up now.

         HAPPY BIRTHDAY JACKIE!    Hope ya have a groovy day and get lots of goodies! Yay! If you are not busy on Monday perhaps I can pop over after work to give you your pressie on my way to Pauls house? Would do over weekend but working all day both days I think so no time :( But yea, have a cooooooool day!  War and Peace yesterday was cool. Brought some more camo's. Slightly sunburnt....oh man it hurts so much! When I have a shower I thought ooo the water will perhaps cool it but oh no, just stings! GAH! Ah well.  Working all day today. May try and book a weekend off somewhere just so I can relax a bit. So far all my weekends off have consisted of me taking them off for a reason so perhaps it'll be nice just to have a weekend to do sod all.  Hope your day is cool everyone!

       At the moment, I'm wearing blue shorts and my tie-dyed Tempest t-shirt. I look a state, good job I'm not going anywhere. I've had a largely unexciting two days. Most exciting thing that has happened is me going to see the new Sainsbury's, which I'm quite impressed with :D  My plans up to next Friday look a little like this:  Today: Bugger all Tomorrow: Work, take my little brother to cinema to see Around The World In 80 Days :) Sunday: Nowt again. Probably tidy up my room and make a start on my homework (shocking!) Monday: Nicki coming over :) Tuesday: Work in the evening, during the day too if they'll let me Wednesday: Off to Nottingham to visit family! Thursday: Still in Notthingham Friday: Come back from Nottingham  A question to everyone:  Which celebrity do you think you resemble the most?

       Cool Jackie. Simon wants to go down park so I said may as well leave it up to Jackie and I as we organised the majority of then last summer. It was cool :) Well my week next week as far as I know (until I go work on Sat and check hours for week) is: Monday: working 9 - 12 being kingstore trained, then Pauls in afternoon Tuesday: having hair cut (yes cut cut short short, wel, short) Wednesday: possible work Thursday: possible work Friday: possible work I can't say for sure during the week until Sat. Sounds like a good idea anyway :)  Today and tomorrow I am out at the war and peace show so should be good. It appears I have done my back in somehow. Perhaps I fell over during the night because it hurts rather alot. Gah.  Have a cool day ya'll.

       End of term guys and gals. Yay. Thank God for that. It came way too slowly. I have one lesson this morning and that is geology and that consists of watching the fifth element which at the moment I still stand by as being a bad film but then again only 1 hour into it, roughly.  I am going Croydon tonight to get Jackie a pressie :) I know you said you didn't want any by Jackie you know I am gonna get you summit.   You have just won one million dollars:    1. Who do you call first?&nbsp;  Family then Paul.  2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  A new life. No sorry I dunno. There isn't anything&nbsp;I desparatly want. Perhaps driving lessons then a car or something I dunno.  3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?&nbsp;  Whatever Paul wants.   4. Do you give any away?  I'd give to the company or organisation that looks after the war graves. I am sure there must be a donation area somewhere and I shall donate. 5.  Do you invest any? If so, how?  Put some away in one of those accounts where if you don't touch it for like six years you get double or something silly like that. Put some away for uni and let interest gather.

What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  The fattest, fastest computer I can build, oh yes - and a PowerMac G5 worth about £8000.  3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?  Laptop for Lora's bday.  4. Do you give any away?  I'll give my parents some to put towards their new house.  5. Do you invest any?  Yes, buy a small house in a popular holiday tourist place and rent it out to people.

       HIYA, Paul - yesterday the driving school of kenley phoned me, to let me know that there had been some kind of 'dissagrement' and that they had decided to 'terminate her contract'  so in mordern language, that means they had an argument and sacked her.  Kenley will probally call you as well paul, they said to me that if i want they would arrange me another instructor from kenley, but they also said they dont know what she is doing now. I have talked with tom about this and he aggrees that she is either gonna start up on her own or join another company, and kenley aggree that it would be good for us to stay with her. so i will be contacting her to find out what she is doing, and hopefully will be continuing my lessons with her. Talk to you all soon, Dave

There are some things money can't buy (for everything else, there's MasterCard)  4. Yeah. Not the two-fingers-in-mouth whistle though  5. Uh. It's possible I suppose. But I've never seen any paticularly good evidence, so it remains unknown

       No one has blogged this week :( Mind you I haven't either. Tom please blog? We don't argue with EVERY single thing you say. Andy blog too!  Um so this week. UCAS, what do you all think of that? I feel that Tuseday was quite a waste as there were no art students and I really need to sort out how to aply to art colleges. I am sure it was helpful for people thinking of doing law and stuff, and for those who don't know what university is like. It was allright but I felt that it didn't help me that much.  I'm still at school at the moment, doing my english lit presentation with Jenna. We're doing 'Anthem For Doomed Youth' by Sassoon and Owen. Its all very interesting and fun filled. I'm looking forward to the English Literature trip next week. I have to take LOTS of photos and do sketches as I am doing war in art and looking at the death side of things. Oh that reminds me I need to purchase some pollyfiller to use in art... Right noted. But also one of my artists I am researching has created the metal (or wood I am not sure) images that are in the Ypres memorial. All very interesting. Someone said they didn't want to go to France for two days and walk around graves, it isn't their thing. But its not walking around graves. Its walking around history. Each grave, each man who has died has a story, each man has their place in history. Even the cemeteries have their own small story to tell about why they are there. Everything there has a reason. Even the ones who have no name. Thats like a instand story of sadness because they are lost and no one knows where.   Yea so should be good. A sad trip, but still good.  If you could could everyone do a blog please? Just a quick one at least...

       Come on guys lets blog :) Lets hear how everyones work shadowing or experience went!!  I didn't do it, instead I spent two days in school catching up on textiles work and it is looking pretty good.  I now also hate Ken Livingston. Always have really. This whole thing about 4 by 4s. There is no problem with owning one. They are lot more comfortable than some cars and yea so they are big?? So what?? They don't actually take up more space its only because they are taller. Its actually handy haveing a jeep here as there are some roads around here they actaully help getting around on. Everyone has the right to choose. Banning them are going to create so many problems. I know about the stats saying about if you get hit by a 4 by 4 you are so and so more likely to be killed because they are higher but in that case people should just be more careful. The majority of jeep owners are older people who have been driving before and so know how to handle the roads senseibly. Ugh that man annoys me so much.

       Well well I'm not topless so neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer. :p  Oh dear Lord the madness that did descend upon us at work today. We completed literally all weekend tasks on Saturday and so today could afford to do those jobs you never have time for such as: scanning off faulty goods and then: DESTROYING THEM!!! Yes. You see folks once you have scanned off a product which is faulty for whatever reason: doesn't sork, broken etc... then you must smash it up comepletely because they little pikeys can't get it out of the trash and then try and claim it for a refund. The fools. So once Lora had finished with toys and whatnot I set about on the electrial goods. Which are full of plastic, metal and other sharp objects. This left me with many a small cut on my hands, arms and face. Woo! The pain was worth the amusement of getting a mallet and smushing a kettle in one blow. Yes I really am the amazing spider-wo-man. Woooooo!  Yea so after that we spent the rest of the afternoon with everyone slagging everyone else off. In a jokey way. All rather amusing. Ritchie slagging off Lora, Lora slagging him back. Me slagging of Deano, Deano not knowing what is going on. Char helping me confuse Dean etc.. etc... madness. All of it.
