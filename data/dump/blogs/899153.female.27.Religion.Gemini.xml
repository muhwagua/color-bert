      So,  urlLink Julia  and  urlLink I  seem to be on the same wavelength all the damn time.  About a half an hour ago, we were chatting about all the photos we have, but that we never have enough time to send them to each other, not to mention all of our other friends who should see them.  And so the brainstorming began (our intellects are SO dizzying).  This Blog is the product of the aforementioned brainstorming.       urlLink    The inspirational photo for our new blog.  Here we go!  Whee.......!!!!    Our hope is that all of our friends will also post their photos.  Keeping in touch just got a little easier.  And more fun!    Julia, I promise not to publish anything incriminating unless you say it's ok.  *winks*

       More Stress Than It's Worth  Kevin and I are supposed to have dinner with his parents tonight, to discuss the "Master Plan".  By this I refer to our wedding arrangements thus far.  While I know that his parents are well-intentioned, they have started getting on my nerves in a big way.  Kevin freaked out last night about the wedding, which I don't understand because he hasn't had to make a decision about anything yet.  The dinner tonight is supposed to calm his anxieties, I think.  But I know how it will go...future Mom & Dad-in-Law will give us suggestions, and we will be obligated to consider said suggestions.  This has already happened several times in the last 2 weeks since we announced the engagement.    I am very picky and stubborn.  I have a picture in my head of exactly the way I want things to be for this wedding and following reception.  I am in favor of going completely against tradition and doing things uniquely and differently.  Luckily, Kevin and I agree on most everything, from the level of formality to the kind of music played and alcohol served.  Unfortunately, we are meeting obstacles from everyone else.  We understand that his parents may feel like they have a larger burden to bear than some, because the event in it's entirety will be held at their home.  But come on!  Don't keep telling us that it's "our day" and then try to make all the decisions yourselves!  Grr!  If I hear "you might want to rethink that" one more time, I'm going to crack some skulls!

       A Love-Hate Relationship  I love Autumn.  I love watching the leaves change colors.  I love wearing wool sweaters.  I love backyard bonfires.  I DO NOT love Halloween.  Granted, yesterday afternoon I made a trip to the farmer's market where I purchased an assortment or gourds and punkins.  Granted, I dug out my seasonal decorations and spruced up the house a bit.  I will probably also answer the door for the neighborhood trick-or-treaters come 31 October.  But it will be with some trepidation.  Inevitably something bizarre always happens to me on Halloween.  I recall being traumatized at 3 or 4 years of age when my next door neighbor, dressed as Tony the Tiger, lunged at me after my parents urged me to answer the door.  Since then it has been like pulling teeth to get me to even participate in any such Halloween-ish activites.

       And....they're off!  Today marked the first day of true wedding-stuff shopping, courtesy of future mom-in-law.  We had a lovely, very lady-like afternoon luncheon at  urlLink The Tea Room at Ashley Place .  I felt very dainty, indeed...the best jasmine tea I've ever had was served to me in the tiniest, most fragile tea cup imaginable.  I had a lovely cranberry and almond chicken salad, Waldorf salad, and a tiny deviled egg.  Then Mom-in-Law's cell phone went off and we were promptly hustled out of the tea room.  We browsed around  urlLink Pat Catan's  a while, collecting an assortment of silk flowers to use for the trellis under which I will be married.  Then we headed to the  urlLink A.I. Root  candle factory warehouse.  Yummy!  I was going to pick out a Unity Candle, but I felt weird doing it without Kevin.    We booked my flower order on the way home, when we decided on a whim to stop at a nursery,  urlLink Barco's Liberty Gardens .  We walked in, and there they were...the most gorgeous Gerbera Daisies I have ever seen.  I love them!  Finally!  Mom-in-Law had been set on using silk flowers until she saw these daisies.  We immediately ordered 40 plants.  I can't wait!!  Back at Mom-in-Law's house, before I could leave to go home, we had to go pull Kevin and Lou and the truck out of the mud.  Yes, yes.  Again.  Ever since Lou got his 4-Wheeler, they have been like little boys again, coming home caked in mud after hours of riding that thing.  I refuse to get on that thing without a helmet.  Since there's no helmet law in Ohio, it looks like I will be the party pooper till the 4-Wheeler poops out!

        a sorta fairytale   Congrats to Courtney, an aspiring muralist, on her new website!  I knew she was talented a long time ago, when she used to draw crazy pictures in my Australia journal.  That was just over 10 years ago.  She has grown so much since then, so please go check out  urlLink Courtney's Murals .  I plan to hire her as soon as I decide what to do with my house.  Either that or babies start coming.  HAH!  JUST KIDDING!

       The Latest Addition  Monday night when I came home from work, Kevin told me he had to go back to work for a meeting.  I wasn't feeling well, so while he was gone I went to bed to rest for a spell.  He comes home, opens the door to the bedroom, and presented me with the sweetest little KITTEN I've ever seen.  Instantly I felt better.    After spending a few days with the little one, last night we finally decided to name her Isabel.  We've been calling her Izzie for short.  She's pure black with huge yellow eyes, very playful and lovey, and very much fond of her 2 older brothers who want nothing to do with her.  Last night, all 3 of them got baths, which were very much needed.  I had smelly babies.  Anyway, it's a good thing Kevin brought her home to me, as I'm sure she will keep me occupied while he is busy conquering  urlLink Grand Theft Auto 4 .  My TV privileges have been revoked for the next month.

        just an empty cage, girl   Here's the weekend update from last weekend:  Friday... Kev and I spent our Friday evening cleaning the basement after Dave got everything out.  We moppoed, we scrubbed, we ripped up more carpeting which we threw out.  The basement bathroom was a sight to behold...it's still not clean yet.  *shudders*  I don't know how anyone could live like that.  On top of all the cleaning, our washing machine decided to stop working on us, right in the middle of a load of towels.  Luckily, my in-laws happened to be in the neighborhood so they stopped by to take a look.  My father-in-law designs and installs heating and A/C systems for a living, so he's pretty handy to have around.  He was able to fix the machine temporarily till he can get a part for it.  In the mean time, I have to be extra careful not to reach into the washer during the spin cycle, or I could potentially lose my arm.   Saturday... Finally talked to my sister today.  I had been waiting for her to call since Kevin and I had gotten married.  We had a nice chat, which was long overdue.  Saturday night we went to Northfield Lanes where we met some of Kevin's friends from work.  I do not volumtarily set foot in bowling alleys without good reason.  And Kevin buying all the beer for me seemed like reason enough.  We had a good time- it's been a while since the two of us went out without our usual circle of friends.     Sunday... Spent all day working in the yard today.  Cut back my rose bushes, ripped out my out-of-control tomato plant which I nick-named Seymour.  The resemblance to Little Shop of Horrors was too obvious.  Kevin and Frank went and got rocks to landscape our front yard.   When they finally came back with about, oh, 4 tons of them, I went in the house.  Kevin spent all afternoon and most of the evening landscaping the front yard around the flower beds.  Finally I had to drag him inside, as it was too dark to do anything else.

       Merlin likes Mendelssohn and even Mahler!  According to  urlLink this article  at the  urlLink Discovery Channel Website , dogs are more responsive to Classical music than any other type of music.  Next time Merlin is terrorizing the kitties I'll have to keep this in mind...maybe put something real sedate and boring on.  Nielson's 2nd Symphony maybe, or a Machaut motet.  It doesn't get any more boring than that.

        "emma" was a cornflake girl   Our usual routine after work is this: we come home, have a couple beers, smoke a few cigarettes (Kevin, mostly), and talk till it's time for dinner.  Yesterday, we were ambushed by our roommate Dave (rented the basement from us shortly after we moved in) while in the garage having our usual after work pow-wow.  Out of nowhere he came in and exclaimed he was moving out because he felt ignored by us and that he just didn't feel like he was part of our world.  *shakes head*  He also accused me of snooping in his bathroom 2 nights ago.  I was extremely offended by this...me of all people.  I  was  in his bathroom the other night, but only to turn on the light so I could see to turn on the clothes drier without turning on the big overhead light which would surely wake him up.  I couldn't believe the things he was saying to us.  Did he think when he moved in that it was going to be like Animal House- a frat party 24 hours a day?  Or did he think it was going to be like a happy little family, the 3 of us living there?  Get real.  We work, we come home, we eat, we talk, we go to bed.  It's slightly more exciting than that on the weekends.  I'm glad he's gone now.  We have the house to ourselves, but I wonder if I shouldn't get the locks changed.  I don't trust Dave any farther than I could throw him.  Last night Kev and I made a quick trip out to DrugMart to pick up a few things.  I brought along my copy of the Cornflake Girl single.  Pulling into the DrugMart parking lot, Kevin was singing "Emma was a cornflake girl...." at the top of his lungs, not stopping when we walked into the store.  This continued through the Wendy's drive-thru on the way home, at every red light out the car window, and in our back yard when we finally got home.  He refused to listen to me when I pointed out that the lyrics are "EVER was a cornflake girl".  I can't complain, though...my husband likes Tori and knows all the words (except one) to Cornflake Girl.

        poppa, i know there's a frog on my toe  maybe i'll call him jethro   Yesterday evening I met Kevin's maternal grandfather for the very first time.  He and Kevin's grandmother were divorced a few years back, and the family sort of shut him out.    We stopped by his house after having dinner at the  urlLink Outback Steakhouse  and subsequently chasing after a stray cat on the way. (I spotted the kitty darting across the road and pleaded with Kev to pull over so I could rescue her.  Guess she didn't want to be rescued, because I have never seen a cat book it that fast away from me.)  Anyway, on a whim and since we were in the neighborhood, Kevin said he wanted to stop by his grandfather's.  It was interesting but a little awkward as Kevin introduced me as his wife, meanwhile his grandfather was still getting over the initial shock that we were standing in his living room.  After the visit, on the way back out to the car Kevin thanked me incessantly for agreeing to the visit.  I didn't think I needed to be thanked for that...I would never try to keep family apart.  I have such a wonderful husband!  :o)

        and as i twist i hold tight and i ride to work every morning wondering why   Well, back to normal it is.  It was strange getting back into my regular routine yesterday.  I don't feel any different being married- I feel the same as I did last Tuesday.  But everyone at work has been heckling me a little, all in fun of course.  Marcia brought me pie and balloons; Phil insisted on calling me Mrs. W******** all day.  Of course everyone wanted to see pictures.  Even my boss was ok yesterday.  Imagine that.  Everyone was a little shocked, however, because no one knew about this weekend except for Marcia and my boss.  To everyone else it was a complete surprise.

       Birthday Wishes...  ...go out to Julia today!  Happy Birthday, Julia!  I won't say how old she is, but I'll be thinking about her all day.  And about her 13th birthday party, which I always think about on her birthday.  And the incident where I convinced her father I had flushed a sneaker down the toilet.  We still get a chuckle out of that, despite the fact that her father was royally pissed at me, I'm sure, for a very long time following.

        you see her olives are cold pressed and her best friend is a sun dress   Continuing on..the rest of the weekend went by so fast, I can't believe now that it's all over and I'm back at work.  Saturday afternoon, Sue, my Mom, and I went out to do a little shopping.  I tried on several wedding dresses, all of which were way to formal for me.  I think I still want to stick with my original sun dress and flip flops idea.  We went to  urlLink Pat Catan's  where we were attacked the moment  we walked in the door.  Talk about obnoxious!  Everything about that place was pretentious.  Although, I have to admit it was fun trying on dresses.  One of them was gorgeous....very Renaissance Era-looking.  My Mom cried the whole time, but Sue and I had a blast taking pictures.  That night we went out to dinner at  urlLink Quaker Steak & Lube , which I thought the boys would enjoy.  Classic cars everywhere, very nostalgic.  Who wouldn't love that?  Afterward, as a group, we went to see  urlLink My Big Fat Greek Wedding .  Everyone loved that, including my Dad, who guffawed throughout.  Kevin fell asleep so I had to continually jab him in the ribs.    All in all, we had a really great weekend.  The nice thing is that we'll get to have 2 weddings, which means twice as much fun.  So, now it's back to the planning for July.

       We did it!  Well, guys....I'm married!  It was a gorgeous day yesterday- the sun was shining, we were surrounded by family and friends, and Merlin.  :o)    Yesterday morning Kevin and I went downtown to get the marriage license.  It was funny because while we were in the office at City Hall doing the paperwork, another couple came in.  They were asked if their marriage license would be used within 60 days, and the prospective Groom said "Yeah, we're getting married in a week!"  Being as overzealous as I am, I blurted out "We're getting married at 11:00!"  Kev was so embarrassed he turned bright red.  We had to be at Parma City Hall a little before 11.  Our ceremony was held up so they could get the prisoners out.  We went in, took some pictures, met the Judge, and then proceeded with the ceremony.  Kevin looked like he was going to pass out before we went in.  It was a very short ceremony...we exchanged vows in front of the judge which lasted less than 5 minutes.  Then we were married!  We had brunch at the Olive Garden, had loads of champagne and food, and even a small little wedding cake.  We came back to our house and spent the rest of the afternoon having cocktails.  All our friends came over to visit, so my Dad cooked stir fry for about 15 people.  He's so good.  It was such a busy day that we ended up passing out fairly early, and we even forgot to open the other 2 bottles of champagne.  Sue's beau, Andy, took lots of pictures with his digital camera and will post them on his website as soon as he can.  I'll post the link when it's ready to go, so you can all check out the photos of our big day.

        in the last extremity - to advance or not to advance -  i hear you laughing   My last day as a single woman.  This morning I drove to work for the last time single.  Tonight Kevin and I will eat our last meal as single people together.  Tomorrow morning I will take my last shower as a single woman.  In about 24 1/2 hours I will be married.  No wonder I feel a little sick to my stomach today!  Just nerves.  I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my parents for this.  Sue is also coming, as my witness, and bringing her beau.  This weekend we're going to party until we all pass out, I'm sure.  :o)  It's all good.  Forgive me if I don't post till Monday.  Wish me luck!

       crazy again  Got a secret...we're eloping on Friday.  To some, it's not a secret, but to others, well, now you know.  My parents know.  Kev's parents know.  We're going to City Hall on Friday.  Why?  Why not?  We just want to do it.  We'd throw the whole wedding now, tomorrow, if we could.  But that takes a little more time and money than we have at the present moment.  We're both excited.  I'm a little apprehensive about changing my name.   he's gonna change my name/someody leave the light on/just in, just in, just in case I like the dancing...   Anyway, we're having a huge party Friday night out here.  My parents will be here.  I'm wearing denim to the ceremony.  How's that for defiance of tradition?!  HAH!  Last night I had a crazy dream again.  I dreamed that we woke up late Friday morning- too late to get the marriage license and we missed going in front of the judge.  I cried the entire time, meanwhile my parents were still frantically running around saying "we can still make it!".  Uh huh.  I also dreamed the pastor from my church was there.  *Shudders*  That'll never happen.

        carnival time is here ~ magical time, i’m near and as the time draws near ~ dreams fill my heart   I seem to most often dream in spurts.  I'll go for several weeks without remembering a single dream, and then suddenly I'll remember everything for a week straight.  Last night I had the most bizarre dream yet.  I dreamed I had a daughter- a toddler with curly blonde hair.  She was beautiful, except for the fact that she was missing one of her hands.    According to this  urlLink dream interpretation , my dream may have had wish-fulfillment content, as I am in my prime child bearing years.  The disfigurement aspect of it might have signified my dissatisfaction with something...perhaps not having children yet?  Kevin and I have had lengthy discusions on child rearing lately.  We've even gone as far as choosing names.    On the other hand, last night at choir practice we were discussing pregnancies, etc.  There's a member of my choir who is due in January.  It's fascinating to listen to her describe her feelings, her physical reactions to the pregnancy.  All that stuff.  I realized last night that, being the youngest female at practice, I was also the only one without children.  All in good time, though.  :o)

According to  urlLink this quiz , my wedding style is:  Tradition Meets Trendy  Your style is "tradition with a twist" -- you're not ready to forgo tradition, but you feel strongly that your wedding reflects your personality and your groom's, as well as your modern lifestyle and relationship. While you can't imagine forcing all your single female friends to fill the dance floor and scramble to catch your bouquet, you like the idea of sharing a first dance with your new husband. Nowadays, it's completely acceptable for brides to question customs and revise traditions; in fact, it's a must. That way, you can include some of the common and familiar elements that work for you and still have the freedom to make changes where necessary. After all, most brides have to figure out a way to involve parents, stepparents and often children in their wedding day.

        we're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, from paradise but they think that we're holding a secretive ball won't someone invite them, they're just taller children that's all, after all   So, what is proper wedding invitation etiquette?  I know I'm not obligated to invite certain people, but where does one draw the line between politeness and diplomacy?  For instance, I have a co-worker whom I cannot stand.  She's uncooperative, beligerant, non-communicative, and an all around pain in the ass to work with.  Several other people from work will be invited and most likely will attend.  Do I invite her also because it'll look bad if I don't and pray she doesn't come?  Or, do I not invite her and hope it doesn't cause any problems at work?  Help!

        om la boomleigh   I was talking to Sue over the weekend and she gave me a great idea for music at the reception.  Kevin and I plan to hire a DJ who is willing to play music we select ourselves, and none of that other foofy, cheesy, hurts-to-listen-to music you sometimes hear played at wedding receptions.  We are very anti-Chicken Dance/Electric Slide, etc.  Ew.  Sue said that when we send out invitations, on the RSVP card we should ask each guest to request a song or two that they would like to hear played at the reception.  This way, we'll still have a wide variety of music to suit everyone's tastes.  I've already started on the list of music Kevin and I would like, but I welcome any and all suggestions.

        Immortal Beloved   Exactly 200 years ago yesterday, in a letter to his brothers which was later titled  urlLink The Heiligenstadt Testament , Beethoven announced he had been stricken by deafness.  This was the first time Beethoven's affliction became public, when in actuality, he had become deaf six years earlier.  In his letter, Beethoven blamed his deafness for his moodiness, depression, and volatile temper.  Beethoven's hearing loss brought on intense feelings of inadequacy which plagued him the rest of his life.  He thought that he, above everyone else, should possess the ability to hear his own creations.

        boats made out of paper float dreams made up for the banana king, darling   Ok, so I want to make my own wedding invitations.  I love the look of handmade paper and I'd like to try and incorporate that sort of material into an invitation somehow.  I found paper-making instructions  urlLink here , but it seems like an awfully messy task.  Maybe put in some dried flowers, or flower petals.   But do I really want to get my blender involved in this?  I'm not so good with household appliances.

        up on the 101   Yesterday marked the third time in a week that I have heard  urlLink  a sorta fairytale   played on commercial radio.  Well, ok, so Baldwin-Wallace College's radio station  urlLink WBWC The Sting  isn't exactly commercial, but it's close enough.  Anyway, this is the most I have heard Tori Amos played in regular rotation anywhere in Cleveland since 1998 when  urlLink  from the choirgirl hotel   was released.  (What does Cleveland have against Tori?!?)  While I was listening yesterday on my way to the post office, I almost got in an accident because Tori came on and I got so excited that I swerved into the post office parking lot, narrowly missing an unsuspecting pedestrian.     Sue and I have started making plans to go to Columbus in November to see Tori in concert during the  urlLink Scarlet's Walk Tour .  Again!  I love going to concerts with Sue.  She gets just as excited as I do.  We've been to several Tori shows and Ani DiFranco together.  She respects the fact that I become totally mesmerized by these females, which causes me sometimes to forget where I am and what I am doing.  Last year at the  urlLink  StrangeLittleTour  I forgot that we weren't allowed to bring in cameras to the theatre, so she encouraged me to shove that sucker right down the front of my jeans.  I did, we got in with no hassle, and now we have great pictures to help us remember what a good time we had.

       The Whimsical Riviera Bakehouse  I saw  urlLink this  one morning on NBC's Weekend Today and thought it was the coolest looking cake.  Then I was browsing around and found  urlLink a whole bunch more!   I love the Birthday Cake in the lower right hand corner.  These are just too gorgeous to even think about eating!

        Baker, baker, baking a cake; make me a day...   I marvel at the number of connections I've made through networking out here since I moved to the Cleveland area permanently in 1999.  For instance, all the professionals who will be assisting in various activities come wedding day are people I know personally.  The photographer I booked sings in my choir, and I give her daughter piano lessons.  I work with a baker and a travel agent, not to mention a whole host of musicians.    My Travel Agent co-worker will help us book our Honeymoon to Aruba, probably in January 2004.  We won't have time to go right after the wedding, nor will we want to, I suppose.  Most likely we will spend the rest of the summer after the wedding doing things around the house, i.e. landscaping around where the pool used to be.  I miss that pool.    Tonight, Kevin and I have plans to go check out a bakery upon my co-worker Baker's recommendation.  I just hope the wedding cake baker is willing to give me exactly what I want.  I'm envisioning tiny terra-cotta pots on a wedding cake to go along with the Garden Theme.  We are still undecided on the flavor.  I vote for cheesecake.  Kevin votes for chocolate.  Hmmm.  Maybe we can have wedding pie instead.

        a Bouvier till her wedding day...   I recently started reading  urlLink Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot  by J. Randy Taraborrelli.  After finishing the section on "Whitehouse Infidelities", I could not get to sleep.  (I have always been fascinated by the Kennedys.  During the first trip I ever made to Cape Cod, I insisted upon visiting the Kennedy Compound in Hyannisport.  I had hoped to catch some glimpse of something or someone, but I never did.)  Anyway, last night I wondered about happy marriages.  I thought about my parents.  I thought about Kevin's parents.  I thought about the parents of all my friends.  All this thinking was probably why I slept like crap last night.

       to you brave shoppers out there today:  I have not in the past, nor will I ever patronize  urlLink Abercrombie & Fitch .  However, if that sort of thing turns you on, you'll be happy to know that according to The Associated Press, "teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch will have male models, clad only in underwear, greet shoppers at stores in major cities Friday."  Go to the Abercrombie website for a little teaser.  LOL

        zzzzzzzzz.....   I think I am the only one in Cleveland at work today.  The roads were deserted this morning, except for the few brave shoppers who will not be intimidated by sub-zero temperatures.  I also think I am catching Kevin's monster cold, which he has just started to get over.  Oh great.  I'm seriously thinking of heading home when someone comes in...I'm by myself for another hour possibly.  Blah.  On a more positve note, we had a nice time yesterday at my Aunts'.  Mom came into town Wednesday night, after taking a wrong turn (oops!) which landed her in Lakewood.  She was tired.  Originally we had planned to go down to Columbus Wednesday night, but since Mom never got here till after 8, we elected to go down yesterday morning instead.  We had yummy turkey, and everything one eats on Thanksgiving.  Dinner was followed by pecan and grape pie (ew) and a lengthy game of Trivial Pursuit.  That game lasted hours.  We played for about 4 hours, ending finally at 10pm with Mom in the lead (5 pie) and Aunt Marcia and I tied at 4 pie apiece.  It was time to get going home.  The drive back last night was smooth- no traffic or anything, but by the time we got home it was late and I was exhausted.    Kevin spent the day at his Mom's, and then paid our friend Jerry a visit.  Everyone keeps asking me if it bothered me not spending Thanksgiving with my husband.  It didn't, really.  We would have had fun if he'd been with us, but being the only male in an estrogen-filled house was not desirable for him.  Don't blame him on that one.  I hate being the only girl.  Wonder if Dad and Scott got a deer yesterday...

To see what Beth does,  urlLink go here.   Anyway, tonight my Mom and I head to Columbus to spend Thanksgiving with my Aunts.  Happy Turkey Day, everybody!

       Friday  Good seeing  urlLink Matt  and  urlLink Julia , even if they were just passing through for the evening.  We tried to play Trivial Pursuit.  Matt, Julia, and  urlLink Sue  all did fairly well.  I sucked.  Admittedly, I was the worst player of the evening.  I was so tired I spent most of the game with my head down on the table.   Saturday  Had a nice relaxing morning chatting with the girls.  Sue and I left for Columbus around 1:00.  We thought we'd run into traffic from the OSU v. Michigan game, but it was reasonably clear all the way down.  We made it safely to my Aunt's, spent some time catching up.  I finally told her I had gotten married.  The reaction I received from her was not the reaction I had at all anticipated.  She was happy, and I thought she would have screamed at me.  I love it when family surprises me.  :o)   on scarlet's walk  Ok, I have lots to post, but I know you are all dying to know how the Tori show was, so I'll talk about that first.    We arrived at the Palace Theatre in Columbus at about 7:30 or so.  Debating about whether or not to purchase any memorabilia, I opted not to when I discovered that tour t-shirts were $35!  I am a loyal EWF and I love Tori, but that's ridiculous.  Maybe I'll find one on e-bay sometime.  Anyway, we got to our seats - first row upper balcony - and sort of took it all in.  The show was sold out, so there were people milling around everywhere.    The opening act,  urlLink Howie Day  came on at just about 8pm.  I have to comment on this - I have never so enjoyed an opening act as much as this one.  Howie Day was really, really good.  So good, in fact, that I'll probably purchase his CD some time in the near future.  He was the lone guitarist on stage with maybe 5 or 6 recording devices of some kind.  At different times during his set he would record a few bars, loop them, and continue the process until he had layer upon layer of rhythms (by hitting his guitar), vocals, chords, etc.   urlLink Sue  thought he sounded a lot like Bono.  I disagreed until at the end of one of his songs, he broke into U2's One Love.  Which was really cool.  I loved him.  He called the people in the box seats Muppets.  :o)  Tori came one just after 9pm.  Now, I love Tori no matter what.  She put on a great show, which included songs from all the albums but Strange Little Girls.  Fine with me.  She did 23 songs, including my favorite bee side  Never Seen Blue :   Set List  Wampum Prayer a sorta fairytale Little Earthquakes Pancake Space Dog Sweet Sangria Sugar Black-Dove (January) Wednesday   Band leaves   China Never Seen Blue Twinkle   Band returns   Honey Cornflake Girl Don't Make Me Come To Vegas Amber Waves Precious Things I Can't See New York Spring Haze    1st Encore  Taxi Ride Take To The Sky Horses   2nd Encore  Tear In Your Hand  I was pleased with the concert except for all the idiots who got up and walked around during Tori's performance.  People were so rude, including three teenagers sitting in front of us who talked incessantly throughout the concert.  Grrr.    To read more about this show, urlLink go here .

        so I let Crazy take a spin   It's going to get really busy this weekend!  I'm so excited for my visitors, though.   urlLink Sue ,  urlLink Matt , and  urlLink Julia  will be arriving tomorrow.  Julia and Matt are stopping en route to Columbus to visit another friend.  Sue and I are headed to Columbus on Saturday to visit with my Aunt and to see the  urlLink Tori Amos  show that night.    Next week, though, it gets really crazy: Monday:   2 Choir rehearsals Tuesday:  Bell Choir Rehearsal, Beth visits Wednesday:  Beth goes to Indiana, Mom visits and we go to Columbus Thursday: Thanksgiving in Columbus, driving back to Cleveland that night Friday:  Work all day Saturday:  Pageant Rehearsal Sunday:  Church, Choir Rehearsal, Beth stops on her way back from Indiana  Hopefully my Mom and I will get some Christmas shopping done amidst all my activities.  I've got most of my gifts purchased, with the exception of my brother and sister and in-laws.  Oh, and my husband.  I also want to get my Christmas tree sometime in the near future, but I refuse to do that till it's actually December.

        driving on the vine, over clotheslines but officer I saw the sign...   On the way to the grocery store yesterdy, Kevin pulled the Jeep over into a deserted parking lot, put it in park and got out.  "You're driving," he said.  I said "No f***ing way".  Well, guess what.  Kevin gave me my first driving-stick-lesson as I drove in circles around the parking lot at Southland.    I felt confident enough to drive over to Giant Eagle, so we're on the way and suddenly there's a stop sign.  I stalled the car, and the lady behind me honked her horn at me.  I panicked, stalled about 3 more times and managed to jerk the Jeep out into the middle of the road.  Kevin was very calm and patient with me - a good teacher.  But the lady behind me laid incessantly on her horn and I was on the verge of tears going "I can't do this!"  So, Kevin gets out of the car, walks around behind it and screams at the lady "Go the f*** around!!!!"  She stopped honking her horn.  LOL  I was laughing hysterically, and barely managed to get the clutch/ gas thing long enough to park it.  My legs were shaking by the time I turned off the ignition and we laughed ourselves silly all through the grocery store.

        you always did prefer the drizzle to the rain   Nice weather we had over the weekend.  The sun didn't come out once.  Blech.  I did get a few things accomplished, though not as many as I had hoped.  Cleaning happened, 'cause I'm trying to get ready for my visitors this weekend.  Between now and Wednesday, though, I've got a ton more to do as this weekend BOTH our guest rooms will be in use.  At the same time!    I have been married for one month.  :o)

        on the other side of the galaxy   Yesterday almost directly across the street from  urlLink Arhaus , where Kevin works in Walton Hills, there were several massive explosions as two local businesses went up in flames.  The fire made National news headlines.  Check out  urlLink the story here  on CNN.  Kevin said it was pretty scary.  All the major businesses in the area were evacuated, including the Ford plant, and Arhaus.  Here's the kicker- they forced all of the people in the office at Arhaus to leave, while the warehouse workers, including my husband, were told they had the option to go but only if they felt their lives were in danger.  Gotta love corporate America.  That's all I have to say about that.

        gimme somethin' to believe in...   I want to be in a band.  Badly.  I've started to pay more attention to what's been on the radio lately, in order to compile our wedding set list.  Every once in a while a song will come on and I think " I  could so play this!"  Ok, so in my pseudo band I could play keys and sing.  Kev can play bass or guitar.  Kev's good bud, whom I endearingly call "80's Frank" can play drums.  (If he ever gets a set of his own.)  We'd be set.  The first song we would cover would be by Poison, I'm sure.  LOL  Every rose has it's thorn.  After that though, I'd have a bloody hard time trying to get them to play Indigo Girls tunes.

        you told me last night you were a sun now with your very own devoted satellite   Had weird dreams again last night.  I suppose they stemmed from my persistence at getting Kevin involved in the wedding planning.  His job is to find and hire a DJ, hopefully through a connection we have at  urlLink Lentine's .  This "connection" is who I had a dream about last night.  A naked dream.  *Shudders*  Incidentally, Lentine's is where I met Kevin.  This morning when I woke up, our bedroom, not to mention the entire house was bathed in orange light.  I peeked out the French doors in the dining room and saw the most gorgeous sunrise I've witnessed in a long time.  In fact, I think the last time I was up early enough to catch a sunrise was about 3 years ago.  I should get up early more often.

       the next project, continued...  Last night Kevin and I went through our CD collection.  Our list of songs has grown to about 65, total.  I guess I didn't realize how tough it would be to plan out about 6 hours or so worth of music.  Anyway, I still need more suggestions because after last night, I looked at our playlist, and so far it contains songs mostly by the following:  Motley Crue, Whitesnake, & Van Halen.  (Can you tell who picked these??)  I actually conceded to some Def Leppard and Bon Jovi tunes.  Who doesn't love Jon Bon Jovi?  *drools*  Anyway, I'll post the playlist maybe tomorrow.  I need more suggestions on stuff that isn't '80's Rock.  Please!

First Dance of Bride & Groom:    Thank You  ~Led Zeppelin, covered by Tori Amos   Father of Bride/Bride:   Mother of Groom/Groom:    For Dancing (not necessarily in this order, of course):   Fields of Gold  ~Sting  Ship of Fools  ~Robert Plant  Heavy Metal Drummer  ~Wilco   Ice Cream  ~Sarah McLachlan  The Look of Love  ~Diana Krall  These are Days  ~10,000 Maniacs  Please add, comment, make suggestions!

       Meg Squared  Over the weekend I had a chance to reconnect with some friends from college.  Kevin had never met Mary Ellen, and neither of us had met her husband.  We had a nice time eating, drinking, catching up.  Meg and I perused the B-W yearbook from our senior year, while finishing off a bottle of Bailey's (me) and a large bottle of Beringer White Zin (Meg).    After Mary Ellen and Ed left to go back to Columbus, Meg and I attempted to get Kev and his friend Jerry into a rousing game of Trivial Pursuit.  I was kicking ass, but we ended up calling the game after only about a half hour's worth of play, as Kev and Jerry were bored to tears.  *Shakes head*  I think they just didn't want to lose to a couple of girls.  Meg ended up spending the night, due to the excessive amounts of alcohol consumed.  At least we had a good time, reminscent of that incident in college when we gave  urlLink Julia  a make-over, followed by Meg's consumption of an entire bottle of Boone's.  *Sigh*  Those were the days...

        mahwige...mahwige is vhat bwings us togevah, today...   A friend sent this forward to me yesterday.  I got a slight chuckle out of it.  All the males I passed it on to guffawed: My wife and I have the secret to making a marriage last:  Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant, have a little wine, some  good food and companionship. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays.   We also sleep in separate beds. Hers is in Sydney and mine is in Melbourne. I take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back. I asked my wife where she wanted to go for our anniversary.  "Somewhere I haven't been in a long time!" she said. So I suggested the  kitchen. We always hold hands. If I let go, she shops. She has an electric blender, electric toaster and electric bread maker.  Then she said, "There are too many gadgets and no place to sit down!". So I bought her an electric chair. Remember.... Marriage is the number one cause of divorce. Statistically, 100% of all divorces started with marriage. I married Miss Right. I just didn't know her first name was Always.   I haven't spoken to my wife for 18 months. I don't like to interrupt her. The last fight was my fault. My wife asked, "What's on the TV?".... I said, "Dust!" In the beginning, God created earth and rested. Then God created man and rested. Then God created woman. Since then, neither God nor man has rested. Why do men die before their wives? 'Cause they want to'.

       ugh  The last couple of days have been a total mess!  Tuesday I managed to rip a huge chunk out of my last contact lens.  I've been wearing my awful glasses since then, which has resulted in a constant, incurable headache.  Not to mention that I worked way too late yesterday.  Not to mention that we haven't seen the sun in about 2 weeks.    Things are looking like they may shape up a bit for the weekend.  The temperature is supposed to hit 60, and I've been talking with some out-of-town college friends about getting together this weekend.  Also on the agenda is the completion of the front yard landscaping.  Hoo hoo!

        foodgasm   I think we finally decided on which caterer to book.  Check them out  urlLink here .  As I've said before, we're going for fun and informal, but there will most definitely be nothing like a pig roast.  Our choice should be somewhere in between.  Hope y'all like BBQ!

        and speaking of the Kennedys...  The USA Network has made a movie about the murder of Martha Moxley.  Entitled  urlLink Murder in Greenwich , it apparently follows the investigation of the murder quite closely.  It ends with the June 2002 conviction of Michael Skakel, nephew of Ethel Kennedy who was married to RFK.  It only took 20 flippin' years to determine he was guilty.  (Just like Ted Kennedy in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne in Chappaquiddick.  Just like OJ.  Just like Robert Blake.  Just like Winona Ryder.  When is it going to end?)

       ah, those Kennedys  I'm not one for politics.  I have my opinions, I'll vote tomorrow, I'm somewhat up to speed on most of the major issues.  Today,  urlLink Bill O'Reilly makes a valid arguement  on the lack of integrity in Attorney Generals this nation's had since RFK.  I've said it before.  I'm obsessed with the Kennedys.

       it is  not  the holiday season yet!  This really irritates me.  Not only is it still and only the beginning of November, but it's not even that cold yet.  This afternoon while doing my banking, I noticed that the  urlLink North Royalton Police Department  was hoisting their mammoth green tinsel "Season's Greetings" sign onto the side of their building.  This totally makes me want to vomit because they do it earlier and earlier every year.  I remember last year I was sickened when they did it a week before Thanksgiving.  I mean really, people!

       Hollow Weenie  I have to comment on the differences in Trick-or-Treat in Ohio and New York.  I don't know who devised these "rules", but I find them odd.  This was really my first true Halloween here, since now we have a house and can actually give out candy.  Anyway, apparently in Ohio there is no door-knocking or doorbell-ringing before the exclamatory "Trick-or-Treat!" to which I was accustomed.  Here, the kids just come up to the door and yell it as loud as possible and hope you hear them.  The other "rule" is that trick-or-treating is allowed only between the hours of 6-8pm.  This makes sense to me...less time for trouble to occur.  I made Kevin answer the door last night while I was reliving some old Halloween memories while talking to my mother on the phone: Mom:  Remember the year you dressed up as a No. 2 Pencil? Me:    Yes, Mom. Mom:  Remember the year you dressed up as a witch and answered the door? Me:    Yes, Mom. Mom:  Remember the year you decided to dress up as a Punk Rocker? Me:     Yes, Mom. Mom:   Remember the year you dressed up as Charlie Chaplin? My mother recalled practically every ridiculous costume I've ever worn for Halloween.    Last night we were getting so many kids that finally Kevin just sat outside on the front steps with the candy and his 6-pack of Bud Light.  I heard one all black-clad young child exclaim incredulously "You're giving out beer?!?  Wow!  You're cooler than Eminem!"  Poor disillusioned child.

       game on!  Wow, what a busy last week or so, which explains my lack of posting.  So many good things happened, I couldn't possibly go into detail over them all...  My family was here, and actually Mums and Dud are leaving this morning while I'm at work.  They've been here for a week, and surprisingly I haven't wanted to kill them.  Kevin even suggested they stay through New Year's, to which they declined.  I guess my Dad's got to get home for an x-ray on his leg.  Anyway, we had a wonderful Christmas with lots of food, fun, and presents.  Now it's back to work.  Blah.    Everything went by so fast that it's hard to remember all the stressful anticipation I experienced.  January, when it comes, is always such a let down.  The months ahead, however, will be filled with wedding planning.  Yep.  Time to get back at it again.  *Sighs*

       the Winfield Petting Zoo back together again  I picked a very sore, tired, groggy Isabel up from the Vet yesterday afternoon.  Poor baby.  Her paws are still very tender, and the underside of her belly is marked by a long red incision which is also fairly sore.  Her spunk will return, I'm sure, soon as she heals.  She normally runs around like the Devil, but last night and this morning she had to calculate how much pain it would cause to do various things, i.e. jump on the kitchen counter while I was getting her food = lots of pain; jumping into the bathtub to lick the faucet after my shower = not enough pain to deter her.  You get the idea.

        got a cat named Easter, he says "will you ever learn?"...   Last night, Kevin and I went back to the Vet to pay for Isabel's stuff, and to see if we could possibly bring her home early.  No such luck, which I knew would happen.  I tried telling Kevin this - they don't want her sutures to come out so they keep her over night for observation.  Kevin got wicked crabby and asked if we could at least see her.  The Vet said no, so Isabel doesn't get excited and bleed all over the place.  Plus, she's still drugged with pain meds.  You would have thought Kevin's only son was on his deathbed, the way he was reacting.  He pouted and cursed all the way home in the car.  True enough, I'm sure he'll be an excellent father when the time comes, but if he's like this with a kitten, I can't imagine how he'll behave with children!

        is Thumbalina size 10 on a Wednesday --   Adjusted the Christmas tree last night, but I didn't get a chance to put the lights on it as I had planned.  Instead, I had a little cooking mishap which kept me cleaning most of the night.  I'll not go into detail, but let's just say that I had to wash the walls, floor, and complete stove top when I was finished.  It kind of ruined our plans to go to the jeweler's to pick out wedding rings.  Tonight will be quiet without Isabel.  I dropped her off at the vet this morning for the full deal - shots, front de-claw, and spaying.  I hope she'll be ok.  She has to spend the night, and I know she will completely ignore me tomorrow evening when we pick her up.  I'm the bad Mom for taking her to the vet.  Last night she was in heat (her first one) and howled the entire night, chasing her brothers all over the house trying to seduce them.  They had no clue what was going on.

        falling down as the winter takes one more CHERRY TREE   I was very productive last night - found the Christmas dishes, unpacked and washed them.  We even went to get our Christmas tree.  This was so last minute, though, and I am very disappointed with what's now sitting in the living room.  I feel bad for the poor tree.  I think someone painted her, because on the underside of the needles are lots of dark green splotches which rubbed off on my fingers.  This is what I get for refusing to spend too much money on a tree and waiting till the week before Christmas.  I'm really not a procrastinator.  Really.

        lay me down in sheets of linen, you had a busy day today   Most of my weekend was spent at church, rehearsing the kids for their pageant, which was last night.  I have to say, that despite all my complaining and bitching and moaning, I really love what I do.  Especially working with kids.  Hearing all the laughter last night was totally worth it.  Seeing their faces when Santa made a surprise appearance really got everyone in the Christmas spirit.  They performed fantastically  - they really hammed it up on stage.  Everyone has been so stressed out over Christmas, that I think a good laugh was really needed by all.  I'm so proud of those kids.  Saturday was a real blessing for me - I was waited on hand and foot.  Friday night I had been at church till 10pm setting up for the pageant, making sure our lighting and sound systems were working, etc.  I had to be back at 9am for the dress rehearsal on Saturday.  By the time I got home that afternoon I was wiped out.  I took a nap and when I woke up, Kevin and Gerry had not only made dinner, done the dishes and laundry, but Gerry had also made cupcakes for me to take to the Potluck yesterday.  I am truly a lucky gal.  Kevin and I finished all our shopping yesterday afternoon between rehearsals.  We still haven't gotten a tree yet, but that's hopefully going to happen tomorrow night.  This week is going to be crazy - tree shopping, Isabel going to the vet, possibly some wedding-ring-picking-out...we'll see!  :o)  That's what I want for Christmas!

       To Do  1.  Get tree but not decorate it till the family comes. 2.  Find, unpack, and wash the Christmas dishes. 3.  Take Isabel to the vet. (Note: Must first make appointment.) 4.  Finish up last bit of shopping, which includes forcing myself to purchase the  urlLink GTA4 Vice City Sound Track Boxed Set  for my husband.  *Gags* 5.  Replenish the barren cupboards ASAP.   6.  Make something for a Potluck on Sunday night. 7.  Get guest rooms ready for family visitors. 8.  Keep the peace between family members when I tell the in-laws I won't see them on Christmas day.  (I have two families now and must learn   to make concessions, i.e. I must sacrifice time with my own family who is only all together this one time a year.) 9.  Clean and stock the basement bathroom with necessary cleaning supplies in case we start having a little too much fun. 10.  Make Orange Refrigerator Cookies or suffer the wrath of my husband. 11.  Plan and execute our office Christmas party, which no one wants any part of.   12.  Drink.

       cutting back  The other day we cancelled our cable, because I refuse to pay $40 a month for something we never use.  We got out the ol' antenna and slapped it back on top of the TV.  Nothing.  We got nothing.  Unbelieveable.  So we call the cable company.  This is totally new to me- no one out here can get anything with an antenna.  You still have to pay for local reception to get any channels like NBC, etc.  *Grumbles*  What a crock of you-know-what.  Got my Christmas cards done last night.  Well, almost.  I ran out of cards, with a few people still left on my list.  I didn't think I would want to wish that many people a Merry Christmas.  I didn't think I  liked  that many people.  But I guess being married obligates one to send cards to one's spouse's family as well as one's own.

       When do I sleep?  The Christmas party Friday night was actually fun.  I had a really good time with Kevin's co-workers.  Except for the one who couldn't hold his booze.  We car-pooled with a 300-pound megalomaniac who projectile-vomitted out the back of the Jeep for a straight 25 minutes on our way home from the party.  Bleah.  Too drunk to drive home, he spent the night in our guest room.  Ew, ew, ew, EW!  Saturday, my car died.  Despite being married to an ASE certified mechanic, I am horrible with car maintenance.  I was on my way to rehearsal Saturday morning when at the intersection of Ridge and Pleasant Valley, my car refused to accelerate.  I coasted into the Citgo on the corner and luckily had the cell phone with me.  Since Kevin was at work, I called Lou who came to get me and took me to the autobody shop.  I cannot say enough good things about friends who are mechanics, especially those who only charge me wholesale cost for parts and nothing for labor.  I only needed new plugs and wires and a general tune up, but because I drive a Mercury "Mistake", parts are wicked expensive.  My repairs cost less than half of what they would have, had I gone to some ordinary joe-schmoe garage.  I love my friends.  I spent 6 hours at the mall yesterday, shopping with my in-laws, Kevin's brother and his girlfriend.  It was enough to make me nuts.  That's all I have to say about that.

        good year for hunters and Christmas parties   First, congrats are in order to:  1.) My Dad for getting a deer on Thanksgiving.  I know he will try to sneak in some of that venison in our Christmas dinner, but I will outsmart him.  And, also 2.)  urlLink Sue  for getting out of this winter weather for a spell.  I hope she has a fantastic time at  urlLink Club Med  in Mexico with Andy.  And I also hope there might be a proposal involved at some point.  :o)  Second, tonight Kevin and I are off to our first Christmas party of the month.  Hopefully this will also be the last.  I know, I know.  I'm such a Scrooge.  I just have so much to do.  Anyway, we're going to one of his co-worker's house tonight.  It should be interesting.  Everyone in attendance will also be bringing their children.  We are the only childless couple.  LOL  And the youngest.

       it's not so bad after all   Looks like my cold was short lived, to say the least.  I'm feeling much better lately.  Now if I can only manage my stress!  I've got 2 weeks till the kids' Christmas Pageant at church, and 3 weeks till the choir concert.  Yikes!  Weird dreams again last night...I can't remember all of what I dreamed, but I remember one part where it seems Oscar, my big fat baby kitty, tried to drown himself in a gigantic toilet.  I pulled him out just before he got sucked down into the depths of wherever tiolet water goes to in dreams.  I was happy to see him purring away this morning on top of my pillow.

       sniffle, sniffle  I have come down with a monster cold, which most likely was caught from my husband.  I thought I avoided it when I took extra Vitamin C and Zinc, coupled with consumiing mass quantities of green tea.  No such luck.  At least this isn't strep, like I had last year.  Knock wood.    It's been a while since last posting...Mom went home Sunday and I miss her already.  I got out a few decorations and put up some lights.  This weekend is reserved for getting our tree, rearranging the living room to suit the tree I am envisioning, and decorating the house.  Most of the shopping is done, with the exception of a few stocking stuffers here and there.  (Thank goodness for  urlLink Amazon.com , because I love one-click shopping.)  Wow I am tired.  If I'm not posting for a while, it's 'cause I'm trying to get healthy.  :o)

        and if i'm wasting all your time this time maybe you never learned to take   Ok, I want my weekend back.  I did nothing exciting.  I was lazy and unmotivated to accomplish anything.  The most I did was pig out on pizza and wings, and watch movies, and read.  I suppose yesterday couldn't be helped, because we were pretty much snowed in.  I'm amazed I even made it to church yesterday morning.  I think there were a total of 30 people, half of which belonged in my choir.  (It's a shame really, because yesterday was the first time, in the 4 years I have been employed by the church, that an even somewhat inspiring message was delivered.  Honestly, I was shocked!)  Anyway,  I feel like I gained about 100 pounds from being a couch potato.  I did, though, with Gerry's help, finally decide on colors for the bedroom.  I have everything planned out...paint colors, wallpaper for the one wall behind the bed, fabric colors, curtain panels, etc.  Now I'm excited to get started, except that I can't paint anything till the weather warms up just a wee bit.  All those fumes and nowhere to go with closed windows.  I don't want to asphyxiate the cats, Merlin, or myself.

       back in the saddle again  Picked up my car this morning, new rear bumper and all.  What a treat to be driving in a real vehicle again, although it won't be for long.  She's going to have to go back to the shop again at the end of the week so her wheel bearings can be replaced.  If it's not one thing, it's something else.  I hate cars.  Last night Kevin and I went to a birthday party for Justin, Kevin's brother, and then over to Chuck and Margaret's for a little get together.  Unfortunately, most of the people at Chuck and Margaret's were  urlLink Arhaus  employees, who wasted 4 hours of good beer-drinking time bitching and moaning about how awful that company is.  *Shakes head*  I want those 4 hours of my life back.  Now, please.

       craziness and aggravation  I'm going to rant: 1.  I still don't have my car back.  I still have not heard jack from either insurance company, mine or the woman who hit me.  No one returns phone calls in either office, and every important person to whom I'm supposed to speak is always out of the office at just the right time. 2.  Snow blows.  So do sub-zero temperatures. 3.  My mother-in-law is nuts.  She decided to clean out her closet and wanted to give me some skimpy lingerie she can no longer wear.  What was she thinking?!?!?  Why would I ever want to wear lingerie hand me downs, especially from Kevin's mother?!  That's just wrong!  And gross. 4.  This blog aggravates me.  I'm thinking of quitting the whole thing altogether.  (But then how would I occupy my time at work?  Hmmm.) 5.  I wonder when  urlLink Julia  is going to post her news.  If she's going to post her news.  Maybe I'll get my comments up and running again.  Maybe I won't.  We'll see.

        i know where the car is parked, i know he isn't you    Bumper Cars  Thursday evening I was in a car accident, for those of you who haven't heard what's going on, where I've been.  It was pretty scary and I was really shaken up by it.  Here's what happened:  I was turning into the Post Office on my way home from work.  There was a line of cars in front of me, so obviously I had to stop.  The lady driving the car behind me didn't stop, and rammed into my rear end.  Hard.  Hence, I was not at work yesterday because my back was killing me.  Not to mention that I had to go back to North Royalton where it happened to file a police report because the idiot left before I could call the police.  Practically all day yesterday Kevin and I were fighting with both insurance companies.  We finally took my car in for repairs, as my entire rear bumper will most likely need to be replaced.  So now I am driving a crappy little Saturn rental with no tape deck and manual windows and door locks.  I never thought my car was all that great, but I was spoiled compared to the crapper I'm driving now.  (No offense to you who are Saturn owners.)    I'm pretty much ok, but I may still go to the doctor depending upon how I feel today.  Last night I slept with the heating pad on my neck and upper back all night.  It worked, I guess, because my pain isn't as bad as it was yesterday.  So, no worries - I'm fine.  :o)

        Athena will attest that it could be done   Got all my shopping done this weekend, saw  The Two Towers  , and even decided somewhat on how to redo the master bedroom and bathroom.    For the bedroom, I decided on a faux finish of neutral tones - either doing a colorwash effect or a linen/chambray sort of looking finish.  The things you can do with paint these days amaze me.  On Friday when I was watching  urlLink Room By Room  on  urlLink HGTV  I got inspired to paint the bathroom to make it look like it has a beadboard wainscoting around the perimeter.  I have such big ideas, I can hardly wait to get started.  Now, if only I could have some help from the husband.

       Chinese and rolling heads  So far on my list of things to get done this weekend, I have completed the repair of my  urlLink MSN 8 .  Why is it that whenever I get used to one version of MSN, they have to go and switch it?  I suppose the upgrade is ok, but I can't fit that much more crap on my monitor screen.  I never use the calendar, the stock tracker (I will cry if I look at that anyway), etc.  Argh!  My stupid access numbers were screwed up, not to mention the fact that those idiots charged me twice for the month of December.  It took me half an hour on the phone to straighten this mess out.  I'm done bitching now.  Haggis McBaggis' birthday party was postponed till next week, so we went over to Gerry's house instead.  I had the best General Tso's chicken of my life last night.  It had been a while since the last time I ate Chinese.  I can't wait for leftovers for lunch today.  I always dream strange things when I eat Chinese, and last night was no exception:  I had a dream that Gerry's head came off and that he walked around headless.  Detachable head.  I am reminded of a certain  urlLink King Missile  song at the present moment...

       it's finally Friday  This has seemed like the longest week.  Maybe tonight I'll get to have some fun.  We're supposed to go to a birthday party/get-together for one of Kevin's co-workers tonight at the  urlLink Winking Lizard .  I can't decide whether or not I want to go, because the birthday girl is obnoxious and gross.  Meaning she sleeps around and is always discussing her recent conquest and it's effect on her toddler son, which completely makes me ill.  That, and I can't understand how she gets all these guys because every time I see her she looks like Haggis McBaggis.  On the other hand, if I go I won't be the only girl for a change, and there are will be other people there with whom I enjoy being social.  Maybe just for a drink or two, to get me ready for my busy weekend.  Cheers!

       switching bodies  More weird dreams again last night: 1.  I dreamed I had switched bodies with  urlLink Julia's  ex, whom I may or may not have had a crush on at one time while still at  urlLink B-W . 2.  I also dreamed that Kevin and our extremely attractive friend Kyle switched personalities.   *Sigh*

       taco night  I think the entire neighborhood was at our house last night for tacos.  ARGH!  I had a good time, drinking my G&T's, but I am so tired today.  This past Monday, the day we got 6 inches of snow, I was out with Kevin shoveling our driveway.  Yesterday I paid for it, with an aching back and sore arms and shoulders.  On top of that, I picked up my new glasses last night and am still trying to adjust to the stronger prescription and teeny-tiny lenses.  When I look down now, I have to move my entire head, instead of just my eyes.  I was a sight to behold last night trying to prepare tacos for 6 people, in all my aching awkwardness.  Never again!

       i wish i knew how to sew  Over the Christmas holiday while my family was visiting, I got out my grandmother's wedding dress.  It's been boxed and preserved for years, so it was really an experience opening it.  I promised my mother I would try it on, but reserved the right to veto it, if it wasn't what I wanted to wear in the wedding.  I felt like I was visiting with a ghost when I opened the boxes in which it was contained; like I was opening a grave or something. It was very mystical, really.  The dress was very plain, very simple, with a high collar and poofy short sleeves, made out of a very sheer fabric.  Grandma must have worn a petticoat beneath it, in 1935.  Unfortunately, the dress wasn't preserved very well - there were a few moth holes in it, and it was very yellowed from age.  Not in wearing condition at all.  The good news is, however, that  urlLink Julia's  mother has graciously agreed to look at the dress to determine if she'd be able to create a replica of it - as a wedding gift to Kevin and me.  With a few changes to the style, and a different fabric, I think this would make  the perfect  wedding dress.    I will not, however, be able to call Julia's Mom by her first name.  I just can't!  I've known her since Julia and I were in like, 5th grade and have never called her by her first name.  It's too weird.  :o)

        keep your eyes on her horizon   As I mentioned in my previous post, I'm getting my eyes examined tonight after work.  Tomorrow, I'm going to pick out some new frames, which is very exciting for me.  I'm giving my contacts a rest for a while, I think, and I'm going back to glasses.  I was browsing around, looking at different frames, and I went to  urlLink eyeglasses.com  where you can upload a picture of yourself and "try on" glasses on-line.  How cool is that!

       go Bucks, go Browns  OK, so I don't generally like football, not to mention sports of any kind.  However, when you live in a sports-focused city, it's sometimes hard not to get swept away by the fanaticism.  So, tonight, after getting my eyes examined for the first time in about 4 years, whilst taking down our lovely Christmas tree, Kev and I will be cheering for the OSU Buckeyes as we watch the  urlLink Fiesta Bowl .  And again, on Sunday, we'll be cheering for the Brownies in the playoffs.  That'll be enough football for me till next year.  Unless the Browns are in the Super Bowl.

       getting back to the wedding planning...  Check out these  urlLink invitations .    Also, my very-crafty Mom helped me decide on favors for all the guests.  Our supplies are coming from  urlLink Dan's Crafts and Things  in Rochester, but I wish their crappy website would let me show what I'm getting.  To go along with our garden theme, we're getting little watering cans in which I'm going to put wildflower seed packets, and also I'm going to fill little butterfly cookie cutters with potpourri, wrap them in tulle and tie them with ribbons.  How cute!

Eat healthier and exercise more...take better care of myself. 3.  Be better about car maintenance. 4.  Clean the litter box every day, instead of two or three times a week.

        Yeah you think about that; What you Believe in   Is there a full moon this week?  Yesterday was one of the strangest days I've had in a while.  Yesterday I helped our warehouse guys break down an old upright piano so I could have the carved front panel.  I'm going to refinish it eventually and hang up on a wall somewhere.  Then, my ex shows up at work for no apparent reason other than screwing with my head, which of course I could see right through.  Also, our dryer finally quit on us, so we went to  urlLink Sears  and purchased this lovely  urlLink Kenmore Dryer   in about 20 minutes.  The night was topped off by Kevin's mother practically having a nervous break down on the phone.  She screamed at my poor husband for probably a half hour about the wedding, etc.  Blah, blah, blah.  Kevin quietly laughed while I, mortified, stared at him, not believing what I was hearing.  He handled her very well, and upon finishing his conversation, he turned to me and said "Now do you believe me that she's psycho?"  Yes, yes I do.

        "elephant mind missy you don't have, you forgettin' to fly, darlin', when you sleep"   Kevin has recently had an epiphany.  Instead of trying to get into the Local 38 or becoming an electrician, he has decided to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a pilot.  Except for me, he has met a lot of opposition, especially from his parents.  He went to Ground School while still in high school, logged about 20 hours of flight time, then quit when he thought he could make it as a rock star.  (That's another story.)  Anyway, he subsequently turned over his log book to his mother for safe keeping.  She has now lost it and Kevin is a wreck because he also lost his 20 hours.  Let's hope his old Ground School has a record of him.  Anyway, Sunday he's going flying for the first time in about 7 or 8 years, and then he starts classes Monday night at the  urlLink 5K Flight School .

        At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet.   --Plato  There was a card waiting for me this morning when I got up, from Kevin, that almost made me start crying.  :o)  My Mom sent me a package yesterday, filled with goodies.  It reminded me of when my brother, sister, and I were small and we'd wake up on Valentine's morning to a pile of presents outside our bedroom doors, from the "Valentine Fairy".  LOL  I guess I really do like Valentine's Day after all.    Marrying a man is like buying something you've  been admiring for a long time in a shop window.  You may love it when you get it home, but it doesn't always go with everything else in the house.    --Jean Kerr

        falling down as the winter takes one more Cherry Tree   We have so much snow right now, I think we should all go into hibernation until April.  I know I have said in the past that I hate Valentine's Day,etc., that it's just a greedy ploy by the greeting card companies to make us spend our precious pennies, but recently something changed inside of me.  Something changed so much, in fact, that yesterday I went shopping.  Shopping for my husband.  Mind you, I did not purchase a box of chocolates, or foo-foo underwear, or any sickening red and pink gift adorned with hearts.  Rather, I made a more practical purchase, I think.  Details after V-D.

        little girl you paint them toes    I am almost ready to throw in the towel on the dishwasher purchase.  We were all over town looking this weekend.  Kevin only cares about one thing - that it's stainless steel.  Who cares how it functions?  Who cares how expensive it is?  What about installation, since there's never been a dishwasher in our house, ever?  What about delivery?  What about the headache this gave me?  And second, what about my aching back from stripping wallpaper this weekend?  It took us 5 hours to strip down the wallpaper border in the master bedroom.  5 hours!!!!  The good news is that we now have the cleanest walls you've ever seen in your life.  And they're ready to paint!  So, it looks as though next weekend Kevin and I will be moving into the guest room, while we prep our bedroom for painting.  Then as soon as the weather warms up, the carpet is coming off so we can refinish the hardwood floors.  We are really on a roll!

       Robert Plant without the nut huggers  One of the activities to which I am most looking forward while I'm in Rochester is getting to see my little brother play at Water Street.  Yep, he's in a band.  His jam band, aptly named  urlLink Freestile Walkin' , has a website.  My brother Scott, the "frontman", is described as "Robert Plant without the nut huggers", which I found so hilarious I almost fell off my chair here at work while I was checking their site out for the first time.  Their bassist is my former next-door neighbor. So, I'm giving them a little plug.  If you're in the Rochester area, please go see them, and tell my little Scotty I said hi.  They apparently are lots of fun in concert, especially when they cover one of my old favorites, Neil Diamond's  Cherry Cherry .  LOL  :o)

Begin stripping the god-awful wallpaper border in our bedroom 3.  Start shopping for a dishwasher!!!!  (This is going to be a real challenge...Kevin has his heart set on stainless steel, which bumps the cost up a few hundred more dollars.  I don't think I'm going to win this one.)

       Sometimes we just need to remember what the 12 Rules of Life really are...   1. Never give yourself a haircut after three margaritas.  2. You need only two tools: WD-40 and duct tape. If it doesn't move and it should, use WD-40. If it moves and shouldn't, use the tape.  3. The five most essential words for a healthy, vital relationship are "I apologize" and "you are right."  4. Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.  5. Never pass up an opportunity to pee.  6. If he/she says that you are too good for him/her - believe them.  7. Learn to pick your battles; ask yourself, "Will this matter one year from now? How about one month? One week? One day?"  8. When you make a mistake, make amends immediately. It's easier to eat crow while it's still warm.  9. If you woke up breathing, congratulations! You have another chance!  10. Living well really is the best revenge. Being miserable because of a bad or former relationship just might mean that the other person was right about you.  11. Work is good, but it's not that important. Money is nice, but you can't take it with you. Statistics show most people don't live to spend all they saved; some die even before they retire. Anything we have isn't really ours; it was given to us by God; She just let us borrow it while we're here....even our kids.  12. And finally... Be really good to your family and/or friends. You never know when you are going to need them to empty your bedpan.

        the girl's in circles and circles and circles again   My travel plans to Rochester for later this month have been confirmed.  The last time I spent and substantial amount of time there was nearly 2 years ago.  I don't count last May when I briefly passed by on my way to Scott's graduation from  urlLink Syracuse University .  I was only actually in Rochester for less than 24 hours total time.  As it's looking, I'll have to get myself back to Rochester at least once a month until my wedding dress is done -  urlLink Julia's  Mom's orders - for fittings.

        bury my lovely   I think I'm done being depressed about Kevin not having a job, because there's really nothing I can do about it except support him.  Let's just all hope the bank doesn't foreclose on our house.  Anyway, what a weekend.  Saturday I spent 4 hours in a suburban with a bunch of muddy guys.  We had to go down to Marietta to rescue Lou after the trailer with his four-wheeler flipped over.  That's all I'm going to say.

       we should all be paid for the number of hours it  feels  like we worked   In that case, I'd never have another financial worry, ever.  Kevin lost his job on Tuesday.  In order to compensate, I am working more than is normal for me at this time of year.  Keep in mind that Easter is just around the corner, which is busier in the church than Christmas.  I have extra services coming out of my ass.  I also agreed to play more weddings and funerals, which is the bulk of my weekend plans come Saturday morning.  This blows.

       family feuds  There's no turning back, now.  The invitations have been ordered and are expected to arrive early next week.  I suppose this is all for the best, considering 2 weeks ago at this time we were seriously thinking about pulling the plug on the whole wedding thing anyway - too much stress, yelling, and fighting.  I just don't think it's right that I should have to cross of friends of Kevin's and mine, to make room for other people our parents say we  have  to invite.

       stress  I know it's been a while since I last posted.  I have only one word to say about that: stress.  Anxiety about the wedding, illness invading our home, Kevin going back to school, fear of losing jobs, etc.  It's a bit much right now.   THINGS TO SAY WHEN STRESSED   1. "Okay, okay! I take it back. Unscrew you" 2. "You say I'm a witch like it's a bad thing" 3. "Well this day was a total waste of make-up" 4. "Well aren't we a bloody ray of sunshine?" 5. "Don't bother me, I'm living happily ever after." 6. "Do I look like a people person?" 7. "This isn't an office. It's hell with fluorescent lighting" 8. "I started out with nothing and still have most of it left" 9. "Therapy is expensive. Popping bubble wrap is cheap. You choose" 10. "Why don't you try practicing random acts of intelligence and senseless acts of self-control?" 11. "I'm not crazy. I've been in a very bad mood for 30 years." 12. "Sarcasm is just one more service I offer." 13. "Do they ever shut up on your planet?" 14. "I'm not your type. I'm not inflatable" 15. "Stress is when you wake up screaming and you realize you haven't gone to sleep yet" 16. "Back off!! You're standing in my aura." 17. "Don't worry. I forgot your name too." 18.

       A Plan for Peace   Leave it to Robin Williams to come up with the perfect plan... What we need now is for our UN Ambassador to stand up and repeat this message. Robin Williams' Plan...(Hard to argue with this logic!)    I see a lot of people yelling for peace but I have not heard of a plan for peace. So, here's one plan:    1) The US will apologize to the world for our "interference" in their  affairs, past & present. We will promise never to "interfere" again    2) We will withdraw our troops from all over the world, starting with Germany, South Korea and the Philippines. They don't want us there. We would station troops at our borders. No more sneaking through holes in the fence.    3) All illegal aliens have 90 days to get their affairs together and leave. We'll give them a free trip home. After 90 days the remainder will be gathered up and deported immediately, regardless of who or where they are. France would welcome them.    4) All future visitors will be thoroughly checked and limited to 90 day visits unless given a special permit. No one from a terrorist nation would be allowed in. If you don't like it there, change it yourself, don't hide here. Asylum would not ever be available to anyone. We don't need any more cab drivers.    5) No "students" over age 21. The older ones are the bombers. If they don't attend classes, they get a "D" and it's back home, baby.    6) The US will make a strong effort to become self sufficient energy wise. This will include developing non polluting sources of energy but will require a temporary drilling of oil in the Alaskan wilderness. The caribou will have to cope for a while.    7) Offer Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries $10 a barrel for their oil. If they don't like it, we go someplace else.    8) If there is a famine or other natural catastrophe in the world, we will not "interfere". They can pray to Allah or whomever, for seeds, rain, cement or whatever they need. Besides, most of what we give them gets "lost" or is taken by their army. The people who need it most get very little, anyway.   9) Ship the UN Headquarters to an island some place.  We don't need the spies and fair weather friends here.  Besides, it would make a good homeless shelter or lockup for illegal aliens.   9b) Use the buildings as replacement for the twin towers.   10) All Americans must go to charm and beauty school. That way, no one can call us "Ugly Americans" any longer.    Now, ain't that a winner of a plan. "The Statue of Liberty is no longer saying 'Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses.' She's got a baseball bat and she's yelling, 'You want a piece of me?'"   - Robin Williams

        particle by particle she slowly changes   What a weekend.  Aside from working an extra 27 hours in less than 3 days, nothing much happened besides more fighting with the in-laws.  In my previous post I mentioned I wanted to have some additional people added to the guest list.  Yesterday Kevin's parents gave us their final decision on the issue, which was an emphatic No Way.  I was pissed, so Kevin and I talked about moving the whole wedding to my church in order to accommodate everyone, which is really important to me.  Sensing my frustration with the whole matter, one of my choir members even offered her house to us, which I thought was a very lovely gesture.  However, when Kevin told his parents we may change the location, they exploded.  They said not only would they not attend the wedding if we moved the location, but they would also tell all their relatives and friends not to attend as well.  Good grief.  Should we call their bluff?  My parents think so.    Tonight, Kevin and I will probably go to his parents' house and get the stuff we purchased already, including our 15 bottles of booze, and bring it home, in order to send the message that we're serious about this.  We will offer to have a discussion with them.    We will offer a compromise - we will have the actual wedding at the church.  The reception can either be at their house, or there will be no reception.  What we would do instead is have a small cook out/ get together at our house for immediate family and the closest of friends.  However, if anyone raises her voice, we will leave.  If any certain mother-in-law feels inclined to make a snide remark or an unkind comment, we will leave and the decision will have been made for us.

       the week/weekend blur  So, I can forget about enjoying the warm weather we're supposed to have this weekend.  I will be working an extra 25 hours on top of my normal routine, which I think totally blows.  This is where company loyalty will get you - long, thankless hours with no dinner but peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  That's ok, though, I guess.  Even though Kevin has been working for the last couple of weeks, we are still playing a fair amount of catch up, so the overtime will make it worthwhile.  I'm just a little disappointed I won't be able to do anything else this weekend, really.  I have to get my wedding invitations in the mail next week, but we are still fighting over the guest list.  I very much want to invite everyone in my choir yet Kevin's Mom is completely against it.  I'm not sure why, actually.  Is it the financial burden?  Nope, because that's covered by my parents.  Is it the extra people wandering around her property?  Maybe, but I think that's a cop out.  She refuses to communicate with me about anything, yet whenever I have to go ahead and make a decision, she flips out and starts screaming.  I think she's crazy.

       it's all coming together  Whew.  Now that Easter is finallly over I can breathe again.  I was so busy with services, rehearsals, and performances, I didn't do too much that didn't involve church.  I can pretty much coast now till September.    With the wedding about 2 1/2 months away, we are really pulling together all the details.  The party favors have been started and are about 45%finished.  We made some major purchases last weekend for paper goods.  The booze is purchased.  (Ironic that's the first thing to be finished.  Heh heh.)  This past weekend Kevin and I spent hours upon hours registering- a concept I find archaic, but one on which my mother insisted.  The bridal party flowers have been ordered (despite Kevin's Mom's fear they would attract too many bees).    One of the last things we still need to do is find a cake.  We checked out a few bakeries over the weekend, but we are still having an issue about that.  I wanted strawberry shortcake, but strawberries won't be in season in July, not to mention Kevin hates strawberries.  And all fruit, for that matter.  I hate traditional whitey-white tiered, layered, gobbed-up-on-frosting cakes.  I still want wedding pie, but Kevin is against that because he cannot envision smooshing a piece of pie all over my face.  There will be no smooshing, as far as I'm concerned.  I was thinking about a cake that's made up of a mass of cupcakes........

       We do the best with what we are given  An old man lived alone in Idaho. He wanted to spade his potato garden,  but it was very hard work. His only son, Bubba, who used to help him, was  in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his  predicament.   "Dear Bubba,  I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won't be able to plant  my potato garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a  garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you  would dig the plot for me.  Love, Dad"   A few days later he received a letter from his son.   "Dear Dad  For heaven's sake, dad, don't dig up that garden, that's where I Buried  the BODIES.  Love, Bubba"   At 4A.M. the next morning, F.B.I. agents and local police showed up and  dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the  old man and left. That same day the old man received another letter from  his son.   "Dear Dad  Go ahead and plant the potatoes now. It's the best I could do under the  circumstances  Love Bubba."

       Another thought  The last two nights I have been sleeping rather strangely.  I wonder of Kevin working third shift is disrupting my sleeping patterns.  Last night I had some very screwed up dreams involving a certain ex boyfriend in a petting zoo.  Disturbing.  Then, I woke up at about 3am with a touch of vertigo that lasted until about 20 minutes ago.  I had a very difficult time trying to apply my mascara this morning.  This reminds me of something a former college friend said to me once, in reference to her old boyfriend:   "He's like a work of art, but I don't know whether I should admire him, or nail him to a wall."

       A busy weekend ahead...  Just because it's Friday doesn't mean I'll get to slow down any.  Tonight my parents will be coming into town for their annual "Spring Break".  This means that after work tonight, Kevin and I will be scrambling to straighten up the house, get rid of all traces of cigarette smoke, and make sure they'll have clean sheets to sleep on.  Tomorrow morning I have a dress rehearsal for my choir's performance of our Easter cantata, followed by an Easter Egg Hunt for the little ones.  I'm only going to stick around for that to see grown men wearing pink bunny suits.  Afterward, my Mom and I are headed to Countryside Florist to order the bridal party flowers.    The rest of the weekend will include putting together my way cute wedding favors, addressing invitations, and maybe doing a little shopping  just for me.  I can't remember the last time I got new shoes.

       Let's catch up...   1.   I'm totally excited that  urlLink Syracuse  won the NCAA Championship.  There was much partying at my house that night.  2.   I was supposed to head to Rochester this past Friday for another dress fitting, except that their massive ice storm kept me in Cleveland for yet another weekend.  3.   Kevin was finally hired by the warehouse at  urlLink Pat Catan's .  He starts work there tomorrow, on 3rd shift.  I will hate this, since he will be going to work as I m going to bed.  That blows.  He says, however, that it's only temporary until he can get hired by  urlLink Swagelok  so he can start working his "dream job".  This also means that this weekend I can go shopping again.  Huzzah for that!

       Did you know that...   urlLink ...people working at computers in an office with plants were 12% more productive and less stressed than people doing the same job in an office without plants?   I wonder if I would really freak out if I took all my plants from my office home.  I wish this weather would break soon.  Nice, high 70's temps one day, and then we get days like today where it's a miserable 40 degrees and rainy.  I just have to remember April showers bring May flowers.  I am just  aching  to get out in the yard and start my garden.  My kitchen is packed with seedlings, waiting to be planted.

       weekend plans shaping up nicely  Last night I planted some of my annuals, finally.  I love the smell of Petunias.  Yum!  Tomorrow looks like it will have the best weather this weekend, so we're planning on testing out Lou's new para-sail.  After work I think we're heading down to the lake to test it out.  Hopefully it won't be too cold.

       foot-in-mouth disease  Why is it that as soon as I think I can't possibly stand my mother-in-law, and after I've said some very not-nice things about, she goes and does something absolutely amazing for me?!?!   Friday  Sue and Courtney arrived about dinner time.  I expected my mother and sister to arrive shortly thereafter, however, my father called to tell me my Mom had forgotten her luggage.  So Courtney and I went to Pennsylvania Friday night.  My Dad met us at a rest stop at the Ohio/Pennsylvania border where I picked up the forgotten luggage.  Courtney and I got home about 11-11:30 that night.  But I do have to say that while it was a major pain in the ass, we had a good time catching up, hearing about the last 5 years of each other's lives.     Saturday  ...the day of my lovely bridal shower.  It was so nice - I was so touched at how many people from Kevin's side of the family attended.  Kev's Mom threw a lovely party, complete with yummy food, decorate-the-bride-to-be-with-toilet-paper-games, and lots of presents.  All for me.  Kevin's Mom was astounding - she gave me a Queen Sized quilt which she made herself.  Aside from the fact that she still thinks purple is my favorite color, the quilt is sort of a tribute to my three kitties, complete with fishbowls and patches that look almost identical to my babies.  I cried the instant I saw it, then she cried, and we embraced, and it was such a nice moment between us.  I couldn't believe it.  And now I feel like an ass because of some of the really not-so-nice things I've said about her.     Sunday  My Mom, my sister Gretchen, and I finished the butterfly party favors today and relaxed in front of the TV.  We watched  Adaptaion ,  About a Boy , and  Life or Something Like It .  Since Kevin, my brother Scott, and Lou were in Canada, we waited up for them to get home.  When they finally came in around midnight, it was like a mini-family reunion.  *Smiles*   Monday  How nice it was to sleep in for once!  We had a leisurely brunch at Noon.  I made a feast of French ("Freedom"?) Toast and eggs, while Gretchen made hash browns from scratch.  While Kevin, Scott, and Gretchen went to  urlLink Sears  to use the gift card my Mom gave us as a shower present for Kevin, Mom and I went out and got my annuals.  I didn't get any plants in the ground though, because it started raining right when we got home.  The rest of the evening was spent relaxing with my husband before he had to go to work.  What a nice weekend.  *Sighs*

        maybe i'll grow up to be wise, as good as he    I smile every morning on my way to work, as I'm driving down the side streets in order to avoid the morning rush on York Road.  I smile because every morning at 8:30, just as I pass the school and make the turn onto Kader, there's always an old man out taking his morning walk.  I smile because he wears a beret with sweat pants, and his down vest is the brightest shade of aqua I've ever seen.  Mostly though, I smile because every morning as I drive past him at 8:30, he waves to me.  I've never met him; he doesn't know who I am.  Yet, every morning there he is, waving at me.  And I wave back.

       My weekend in New York  Perhaps Wedneday is a bit late to be talking about the weekend, but wow I haven't had time for anything since I came back Monday night!   Friday  I left Cleveland about 2pm.  The car trip was uneventful, except for some rain right over the P.A./N.Y. border.  Got into town about 7, after stopping a few times for a potty break.  I have the world's smallest bladder.  Luckily Mom and Dad had dinner waiting for me.  I really wanted to go out and see some friends I hadn't seen in a long time, but once dinner was over and my mother and I started talking, the next 5 hours flew by and at midnight I went to bed.  After several glasses of Bourbon.   Saturday  I awoke with a slight headache at 6:45am, got in the shower, and by 7:30, Dad and I were on the way to Potsdam.  Mom had already left to pick up her Godmother Barb, who is like my surrogate grandmother.   After stopping for coffee and breakfast somewhere between Fulton and Antwerp, I felt much better.  We met up with Mom and Barb at a gas station, got out the walkie-talkies, and continued up to Potsdam taking turns spotting for cops.  Heh heh.  Sometimes my Dad's love of gadgets really comes in handy.    We got into town about 2-ish.  Checked into the hotel in which my parents were staying, in Potsdam, and Mom, Barb, and I took a much needed nap.  at 3:30, Mom, Barb, and I left to go to Massena (20 minutes away) to check into the hotel where Barba, my aunt, and I were staying.  Then we went to the Massena Airport to pick up my aunt at 5pm, who had flown in from Columbus.  I've never seen such a tiny airport.  One room! And the plane on which my aunt flew in was a teeny prop plane.  I'm glad I didn't fly.  Dinner was at Maxfield's in downtown Potsdam, where Scott, Gretchen, and Gretchen's boyfriend Dan met up with us.  A very nice dinner we had.  The was the first time we had all been together, except Kevin, since Christmas.  Later that night we headed back to the hotel so Gretchen could open her graduation gifts.  Barb, my aunt, and I drove to Massena at about 11, and Probably everyone was in bed by 12.   Sunday  I was up at 6:30 again, and looking out the window, the weather seemed doubtful.  So I showered and hoped for sun, since Potsdam graduation was to be held outside.  We got to graduation about 9:30 and the sun was shining, and it was warm!  So warm, in fact, that all of us got a massive sunburn.  First, though, before anything else, I have got to complain about how disorganized this graduation ceremony was.  None of the names were called in alphabetical order, so no one knew when his or her child would be walking.  Therefore, everyone felt the need to leave his or her seat, crowd around in front of the stage, and completely block the view of the polite people who remained seated.  Idiots!  It was mass pandemonium up there.  Of course, when Gretchen's name was called, we couldn't see her walk across the stage or shake hands with the Dean.  I was able to see her exit off the stage to my left, but that was it.  So I made sure I screamed as loud and obnoxiously as possible:  "Yeah, Gretchen!!!!"  I got a lot of stares, but I didn't care.  After the ceremony, we did the whole picture-taking thing, followed by 3 hours worth of helping Gretchen pack up her dorm room, where Scott and I did most of the work.  Finally, at about 4 we were back on the road to come back to Rochester.  I was exhausted when we got back, and after unloading the cars (mine and Scott's), I was able to spend some time with my little brother, which I thought was much needed.  So we went out for a ride in his new Thunderbird, and then played Euchre with Dan, and some other friends of his.  It was a nice time.  Now it's back to the routine.  The first day back after vacation is always hardest, and it didn't make things better that all my co-workers called me "Lobster" all day yesterday.  Not to mention I feel like I'm a day behind.  I only have 2 days now to get my house ready for my visitors this weekend!

       The Long Road Home  This afternoon I'm heading home to Rochester for the second time this month (3rd time this year!).  This time I'm going alone, as Kevin has little vacation time left.  I always start to feel anxious about these trips when I make them alone.  There's a kind of duality about them...like I'm 2 people separated by the long stretch of I-90 between Rochester and Cleveland.  When I make the trip, in a lot of ways I feel like I'm going back to my former self.  I have done so much growing and changing since I left Rochester that going home really feels like I'm just temporarily visiting some foreign place.  Yet, when I get there, the place will seem familiar.  I, however, will feel awkward.  I don't know my way around anymore.  I don't have a room at my parents' house anymore.  My old neighbors don't recognize me at all, and I have a fear of running into old high school acquaintances who never left.    These visits always make me nostalgic.  I'm sure I'll spend a lot of time day dreaming and writing in my journal.  Maybe I'll even get to see a couple of the people there about whom I still care.  There are a few.  The good thing is that my time in Rochester itself will be brief.  Saturday morning we head to  urlLink SUNY Potsdam  to meet up with my sister who graduates on Sunday.  Then it's back to Rochester again Sunday afternoon after the graduation ceremony.  Then it's back to Cleveland on Monday.    At least I'll have the long car trips to help prepare myself and make peace with my anxiety.  It's really not that bad.  Just different.

        invite a Guest up until you announced that you had moved in    I re-ordered my invitations yesterday, which cost me an arm and a leg.  I've spent every morning at work this week so far addressing my envelopes before my boss comes in and sees me slacking off.  If you read this blog and you are sent an invitation, here's a head's up:  I know the RSVP says by June 1st.  I don't care if you can't RSVP by June 1st.  The invitations are going out late because of all these last minute changes, so I'm ok with not having an RSVP by the 1st.  No worries.

        Your alter poet is Thomas Stearns Eliot. For you, life rocks pretty hard!    urlLink   Who is Your Alter Poet?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I saw this quiz on  urlLink Julia's Blog  today, and I just had to take it myself.  I find the results particularly interesting and ironic, since I am addicted to T.S. Eliot.  So much so that in high school, I did my senior year AP English research project on him.  Then, in college, I wrote a song cycle to some of his  Wasteland  text.  Hmmmm....

        to advance or not to advance, I hear you calling   The wedding planning is back in full swing again.  This weekend Kevin and I went down to his parents' house to pick up all of our picnic stuff, our 15 bottles of booze, and the pop we've been purchasing on and off for the last six months.  I got a weird vibe from his parents while we were there.  I know they are not happy about what happened, yet they pretended everything was fine.  Oh well.  Now we can proceed with a relatively finalized plan.  I feel badly that this had to happen, but I feel like we did our best to compromise.  At least Kevin's Mom didn't cancel my bridal shower to spite me.  I was worried about that.    This weekend it's off to New York again....

       just released  I am so excited for the next  urlLink Tori Amos Show in Cleveland , on August 16th at the  urlLink Tower City Amphitheater .  I can't wait!  Probably since I am way too cheap to pay $42 for a ticket (even for Tori), I will try and convince Lou to take me down to the flats on the boat so I can hear the show from the river, and not pay anything.  I quite possibly might even be willing to perform sexual favors for this.  That is, if I can convince him not to go to  urlLink Nascar , which is the same weekend.

       I spoke too soon...  We now have the final verdict on our wedding plans.  Kevin's Dad called me last night to tell me they don't want to have the reception at their house.  He said they thought it would be best if we did everything elsewhere.  Translation: they have lost control of the planning and no longer want anything to do with it.  If it's not their way, it's no way.  They did however, still offer to pay for the caterer or give us the money we've already spent.  This means we are back to Back-Up Plan B, and that is for us to have the wedding at the church in the early afternoon, have a punch-and-cookies reception in Fellowship Hall afterward for everyone, and that night have our immediate family, the bridal party, and our out of town friends over to our house for "Barbeque and Booze".  (I like my little code name for that.  Heheh.)    I think this whole ordeal has been unbelievable.  Kevin doubts his parents will even show up for the wedding, let alone the Barbeque and Booze.  He even thinks his mother quite possibly would cancel the shower she is throwing for me, and either send out a letter to everyone she invited, or just not tell them and turn them away at the door in order to spite me.  It's too bad they feel they have to behave this way, because everyone else has been great.  They will look ridiculous if they don't show up to our wedding, but that's their decision.  I refuse to let them run our lives.  I know that if I caved in this one time, they would try and control every decision Kevin and I ever make throughout our entire marriage.  Not gonna happen!!  My parents, on the other hand, don't gove a hoot what we do, as long as we're happy.  My Dad is tickled that he gets to put on his shorts and sneakers and bring the half-barrel grill, since he'll be the honourary BBQ chef.  And this way we'll get to spend time with the people we never see; the people who have supported us throughout this whole thing.   Changes in wedding location: 3 Changes in reception location: 3 Number of times invitations were printed: 2 Number of arguements with in-laws: too many to count Doing things our way: PRICELESS!

       wildflowers  Last night after work I went out and finally started my wildflower garden along the fence next to our driveway.  Last year I planted several Purple Coneflowers and Black-Eyed Susans which have already started to poke out of the soil.  So, yesterday I planned out the plot and got out my flower seeds and went at it.  I planted Giant Sunflowers in the back to give us privacy from the neighbors who are nosy.  I also planted Shasta Daisies, Cosmos, Gypsophilia (Baby's Breath), New England Aster, Columbine, Coreopsis, more Black-Eyed Susans, and Nasturtiums in the flower boxes on the fence.  Since this was my first experience with starting flowers from seeds, let's all say a little prayer and hope they come up.

       not so bad  Last night Kevin and I had a "discussion" with his Mom about our change of wedding plans.  The conversation actually went smoothly, about which I was rather surprised.  There was no yelling or screaming, which I had greatly anticipated.  I calmly explained to Kevin's Mom how we would proceed with things, and though she had a lot of questions, I had all the answers.  I was assertive and she was receptive.  The only thing she did say was that she still needed to "run it by" Kevin's father, who is supposed to call us tonight.  We'll see what happens.

       one can squish a lot of activity into only 2 and a half days  Here's the low down on our wild weekend:  Friday  Ok, so I usually do not like car trips, but I have to say that travelling with my husband was fun.  4 hours on the way to Rochester gave us a chance to catch up on things.  We haven't spent very much time together since he started working nights.  We arrived in Rochester about 11pm.  I was exhausted, but Kevin was still hyper, so he went out to Mastrella's with my sister Gretchen and her friend Lauren to hear my brother Scott's band  urlLink Freestile Walkin' .  I am bummed I fell asleep, because Kevin said they were awesome.  That's not because he was drunk and couldn't tell the difference.   Saturday  Got up early to go to my dress fitting.   urlLink Julia's  Mom is truly an artist.  My dress looks so much like my grandmother's, I couldn't believe it.  After the fitting, my Dad cooked us one of his famous brunches (eggs, bacon, toast, the works....mmmmm) and then insisted on driving us by the scene of this huge accident that took place near where my parents live.   urlLink Read the article here.   A gasoline tanker truck crashed, spilling thousands of gallons of gasoline and scorching the better part of an entire neighborhood.  Then it was on to meet with our minister.  We snuck into the back of my old church to watch Merle officiate a wedding ceremony, and afterward Kevin and I were able to have a brief meeting with him about our own wedding.  Even he said it would be bad professionally for me not to include my church choir at our wedding.    Sue and I headed to  urlLink Park Place Deil  for lunch, where I had what I consider to be the best egg salad in the entire city of Rochester.  It was such a treat!  Shortly after, Kevin and I left to come home.   Sunday  This by far was the best day of the weekend.  After church, we packed up the car and the boat and headed down to the lake.  Yes, it was a little chilly, but we were heavily bundled.  Once we got on the river and the wind died down, so it wasn't too bad.  The sun was out, we were with great company, we had on some great music, and  the water was so relaxing with the sun shining on us.  We cruised up and down the river for about 4 or 5 hours, till the sun started going down.  For the first time in a few weeks, Kevin and I were stress-less, which is a fantastic feeling.  It makes you realize how insignificant little things like stupid arguements are, and how in the grand scheme of things, really all that matters is your own happiness.   So, in the words of Bob Marley,  "Let's get together and feel all right."

       nothing yet  Tonight Kevin and I are off to Rochester for a brief visit and my dress fitting.  It will do us good to get out of here, even if it will only be for 24 hours.  The stress of the wedding planning is starting to get to both of us.  There still has not been a resolution to the in-law problem.  Kevin had a "discussion" with them the other day, but nothing was decided, really.  There was a lot of guilt-tripping and yelling.  I didn't even get to say my piece.  They told us we had to decide what we're doing by Monday.  So I have a phone call to them planned for late Sunday afternoon/evening.  I just hope they are willing to hear me out and I hope they are willing to compromise.  If they are not willing, then I guess we are not willing either.  All I can say, however, is that my parents are being so supportive and flexible.  I'm very lucky.

       "Aw!", "Ew!", & "Whew!"  Yeah, that about sums up my weekend.  In addition to working an extra 7 hours of overtime (which was a lot better than the 16 I thought I was going to have to work), here's a re-cap of the weekend's events:   Saturday  Worked 10 - 2.  I then hit  urlLink Old Navy  to purchase the annual, matching $5 Flag T-shirts, as I do every year.  Kevin gets a kick out of wearing matching clothes with me.  Then I hit up  urlLink Home Depot 's sale on Perennials, where I got a ton of Coreopsis, and also some Zinnias and Blanket Flowers.      "Aw!"   After I came home, Kevin convinced me he wanted to go to the  urlLink Brecksville Home Days .  Little did I know this was a trick!  Instead of going to Brecksville, he took me to Center Woods, where we hiked a ways out till we could see the Cleveland skyline.  It was a gorgeous day, not a cloud in the sky.  Kevin then produced a small box from the pocket of his shorts and opened it.  Inside were our wedding rings.  Aw!  I didn't want to see mine before the wedding, but he was so anxious to show me.  Probably, because the my ring is more like an engagement ring than a wedding ring, since there really was no formal proposal.  I was a mess - crying all over him.  Mostly because I was a total pill hiking to the spot - I kept tripping on branches and rocks, stubbing my toes, complaining the entire time.  Then he brought out the rings and I felt like such a jackass.  LOL    "Ew!"   That night, we worked out in the yard, doing some landscaping around our snowball tree and transplaning some grass plants.  We wanted to get everything ready for Sunday, the day of roto-tilling and grass planting.  I was in the middle of transplanting some Iris bulbs, when I discovered a mass of carpenter ants in the landscaping timbers next to the garage.  Grossness.  So, it was back to  urlLink Home Depot  again, at 11pm, to get ant spray.  And I was a wreck.  Covered in dirt and filth, wearing ripped jeans and a ripped t-shirt.  I was a sight to behold.   Sunday  Played my service in the morning, then headed back to work where I "worked" from 12 - 3.  Kevin had gotten up at 5:30am that morning to go out and finish getting the yard ready.  His parents came over early, tilled the backyard and the back garden, put down the grass seed and hay, and watered.  We have grass planted!!   Whew.    I planted the Coreopsis in the front, gave our Weeping Cherry Tree a massive haircut, and pulled out all the Creeping Myrtle that had started to take over the front flower bed.    I am exhausted.

       Blues in the News   urlLink The House of Blues  is coming to Cleveland.  While it's been no big secret around town this was happening, an officialy announcement was released yesterday.  Subsequently, the Mayor of Cleveland, Jane Campbell, also announced that part of East 9th Street was going to be re-named "Rock and Roll Boulevard".  Not to mention that other hot debates include the location of Cleveland's new Convention Center.  Pretty soon I won't know where anything is anymore.  Oh, and did you hear about the Cavs' draft pick the other day?

        Come on Sugar, bring it on, bring it on; we used to be friends...   Last night I had meant to get out some old letters and re-read some things.  I do that every once in a while, to remind me of things that happened in the past, because usually I block them out.  I guess I've been in a nostalgic mood as of late.  So last night I thought, I'll get in to bed early and read.  I read my journals from 10, 11, 12 years ago, but I couldn't bring myself to look at letters from various people.  Maybe I just wasn't ready for that yet.  But I like to do this sort of thing every once in a while, to remind myself of mistakes I've made, and to help me not repeat them.    Things in my life have changed so much in the last several years.  There have been times when I've felt everything was completely out of control and spiraling toward disaster.  Most of all, though, I think the things that have changed the most are my relationships.  I've made friends and lost them.  I've gotten friends back who I thought were long gone.  And it continues even today, these changing relationships.

        You are the center of your universe   I had a nice weekend, these past two days.  Courtney came out for a much-needed visit.  Friday   After preparing a really gross tuna/tomato/cheese dish, we indulged ourselves in leftover cake and champagne.  While watching slides.  As planned, we got out our Australia pictures and journals and laughed ourselves silly over our anecdotal memories.  It's funny how we each remember different things about that trip.     Saturday  A relaxing morning where we didn't have to do a thing - Kevin cooked us breakfast.  We stuck around to watch the 3 truckloads of dirt get dumped in my backyard (it's level now!), then headed off to do the day's activities.  First, Courtney got the tour of Berea and  urlLink Baldwin-Wallace .  Then it was on to Mazzone's so I could pay the Baker for our wedding pastries.  Next was the highlight of the day -  urlLink The Cleveland Museum of Art .  We spent hours in there, walking around, commenting on what we liked and why.  My favorite still is the Armored Court, while I think Courtney liked the 2 Picasso galleries the most.  We drove through Little Italy on the way up to Coventry, where we walked around for a bit.  We grabbed a coffee and headed home about 5.     Sunday  Went to brunch at 1 in Olmsted Falls, then went to a Flea Market across the street at the  urlLink Grand Pacific Junction Historic Shopping District .  We climbed on the trains, but it was so hot we didn't stay long.  I don't think I was in the sun for more than an hour or so, but my skin got roasted. Courtney left about 3, and I used the remainder of the day to re-pot some plants and bake cupcakes.  Very relaxing.

        Surprise!   Last night was my annual End-of-the-Year Choir picnic.  Or so I thought!  I arrived with my yummy Spinach Salad dish-to-pass (for which I'll post the recipe since everyone was hounding me last night), and as I was walking up to Darlene's front door, several others were arriving with gifts.  I was confused, but pretty soon it was clear they were having a shower for Kevin and me.  I was totally oblivious.  I thought it was someone's birthday and I had forgotten to bring a gift.    Now, Kevin was at home sleeping.  I called him at about 8pm and convinced him to come over to the party.  Everyone joked that Kevin is a myth, since only 2 out of about 20 people had met him.  When he showed up, we cut the cake...a gorgeous Angel Food Cake with strawberry filling, decorated with real daisies and white chocolate.  Mmmmm.   It was so good.   Then came the presents, but Kevin had to leave to go home and get ready for work.  At least he made an appearance.  I was so touched by everything.  It's nice to have that second family around, since mine is all the way in New York.  What a blessing.

       Our Own Reunion  This weekend Courtney is coming in for a pre-Wedding visit.  We are both so excited we can hardly keep it together.  Courtney and I met just over 11 years ago, through the  urlLink People to People International Student Ambassador Program , in a crowded classroom for our introduction to Australia meeting, back at IHS in 1992.  (I have to laugh when I start naming years I did things...seems so long ago.)  Anyway, we really hit it off on the plane to New Zealand, since we had hours and hours and hours to kill.  It was instant-friendship for us.  Last year was our 10th year anniversary of the trip and we wanted to celebrate it.  She and I sort of made attempts at organizing a reunion, but despite our efforts we just couldn't get it together.      So, this weekend we're having our own reunion, complete with pictures, slide shows, travel journals, memories, souvenirs, and lots and lots of alcohol.  Heh heh.  I'm really looking forward to it.     Isn't this ironic...  "People to People - the power of people, acting as individuals, to respond imaginatively to the world's need for peace." -- President John F. Kennedy, who was one of nine U.S. Presidents, including George W. Bush, to serve as People to People's Honorary Chairman      Yet another reason why my Kennedy-obsession is justifiable.

       This is not self-punishment  I am so proud of myself...one of my New Year's Resolutions was to not watch as much TV.  Well, I haven't really followed through on it till recently.  And I am pleased to say that the TV in my house has not been turned on in 2 weeks.  Instead, I've been hurredly getting the house and yard ready for the wedding celebrations.  It's not just that I haven't had time to watch TV, but I don't even miss it at all.  I can get my daily dose of current events from my addiction to  urlLink NPR .  Maybe this no TV thing will become the rule rather than the exception.

       The Dress is done, but still no shoes  I'm almost in panic-mode.  Just when I think I've got everything under control, suddenly more last minute stuff pops up and I get super overwhelmed!  Well, the good news is that my Dress is finished, and is home with me in the closet in the guest room.  Hopefully Kevin won't peek.  But I still have no shoes.  I ended up buying the pair I thought were ok, only to be criticized by my Mother and  urlLink Julia's  Mom because they are not closed-toe.  Good grief.  So, Gretchen and I did more shoe shopping while I was in Rochester, but alas, everything I tried on made me look like a Sasquatch.  Atleast I have the dress.  Atleast I was able to have a little fun while in Rochester, with my sister and Courtney.  Atleast for a few hours I was relatively stress-free.

       One Month and Counting...  The "big day" is exactly one month away.  I think we pretty much have everything under control.  Last weekend we took care of the rest of the bakery (little tarts in many flavors...yum!), the guys' clothing (we decided tuxes would be easiest, cheapest, and classier than anything else), I purchased my, a-hem, "Bridal Underwear" (nothing exciting....thank you, Courtney!), and we got more flowers and plants to make our yard pretty for our party.    However, I'm going back to Rochester this weekend for my final dress fitting and I don't have my shoes yet!  Yesterday after work I went to 7 shoe stores and nothing.  I came home with a lovely pair of black sandals, but no wedding shoes.  I have the strangest looking feet, so nothing looks right on them.  I must have been to every shoe store in Northeast Ohio.  I think I'll go back to  urlLink Kohl's  tonight after work and purchase the pair I thought came the closest to not making me look like I have elephant-feet.

       I let the cat out of the bag  Last night at our last choir practice before the summer begins, I slipped up and told the Big Secret.  While pretty much everyone knows Kevin and I are already married, there were a few people who didn't  - mostly my side of the family, because my Mother didn't want them to know, and my co-workers at church including my choir.  So, last night we were discussing our successful year, how we've grown and improved as an ensemble, etc.  We started talking about rehearsing for the wedding, at which they will perform, and suddenly I said "I have to let you in on a little secret - I'm already married."  I really shocked them!  There were squeals of delight, and there were rolled eyes, and there were looks of disapproval, but all in all they were pretty surprised.  Then I told them not to broadcast it all over the church.  Yeah, right.  No one gossips more than church-goers.  It's going to be a long month.

       What to do this weekend  This is the first weekend in several months where we haven't really needed to get something done.  Yesterday Kevin and I were debating what to do.  After opening all our lovely wedding presents and receiving so much glassware and breakable items, we realized we have no place to put that kind of stuff, out of kitty reach.  So we went out to find a curio cabinet.  However, because I am so picky, everything I looked at was either too big, or just not right.  We're thinking of taking a day trip down to Amish country on Saturday to do some poking around.  Plus everything is cheaper down there anyway.    The other thing we thought we could do is finally get started on our bedroom.  We've had plans for remodelling for months....we have the paint colors picked out, and I have the drapes (red!) purchased as well as the new ceiling fan.  We hope to get the bedroom done before Labor Day Weekend, so maybe we should get started on that and wait on Amish country.  Decisions, decisions.

       Back Home  Kevin was discharged from the hospital yesterday afternoon and is continuing his recovery at home for the rest of the week.  He'll be able to go back to work on Sunday night, thankfully.  He seems to be doing fine, though not quite himself just yet.  However, his prognosis is good.  We were even able to open up wedding presents yesterday afternoon!  Yay!  The first meal Kevin wanted when he came home?  McDonald's.  Of course.

       If you've never prayed before, now's a good time to start.  I'm signing off for a while.  Yesterday afternoon I took Kevin to the Emergency room.  He's going to be hospitalized for a while.

       Recovery  We're still trying to get over the fact that there aren't 10 people staying in our house anymore.    Aside from the sudden quiet, things are almost back to normal.  Our wedding ceremony was perfect.  Kevin was handsome as ever in his tuxedo (yum!).  Pretty soon I think I'll have pictures up somewhere for everyone to look at, once Andy gets his stuff together.  I'll make sure I post the link.  There's just so much to write....  I think I'll leave it at what  urlLink Julia  said:  "Good times."

       5 Days  My weekend consisted of the following: shopping, shopping, shopping, yard work, more shopping, more yard work, more shopping, and picking up the piles fire cracker debris all over our yard from my idiot neighbors.  There was some excitement on the actual 4th of July.  Just as the fireworks were beginning, we got a collect call from Lou who is Kevin's best friend and the Best Man at our wedding.  It seems Lou had a bit too much to drink, fell off the boat up at Catawba Island, ripped a huge gash in his leg, and had to be life-flighted to the Toledo Hospital.  48 stitches later, they promptly kicked his ass out of the hospital.  He managed to get himself a Taxi to the nearest Holiday Inn, but required Kevin to come up there for some reason, still unapparent to me.  I went along to help keep Kevin awake, but the whole trip was pointless and nothing that couldn't have waited till the following morning.  We arrived in Toledo about 1am, picked up Lou who had already gotten a room, and drove him back to Catawba Island so he could sleep in his truck.  *shakes head*  Maybe he was just too doped up on pain killers to realize what a colossal waste of time he caused us.  We got home at 4am.  Lou is now walking with a severe limp.  I hope he can still make it down the aisle.

       9 Days  Mom came in last night and immediately I felt better about all the craziness going on.  She even found 3 different pairs of shoes in Rochester for me, which I tried on last night.  One pair really has potential, but I still have to try it on with the dress.  She also got the "something old, something new" stuff covered for me as well, not to mention the fact that all our prayers worked and she was able to find 2 photographs of my grandparents' wedding from 1935.  (I plan to put a display up in Fellowship Hall of our relatives and friends who have passed and will not be with us next week.)   Something old:   Silver Pin from Williamsburg with my grandmother's initials & the linen baby bonnet I wore home from the hospital which turns into a handkerchief with the snip of a few stiches.  Something new:  Let's see...underwear, shoes when I finally get them.  Something borrowed:  My Mom borrowed a "sixpence for my shoe" from a friend, since she couldn't find hers.    Something blue:  The same friend who lent us the sixpence embroidered a small piece of linen cloth with Kevin's and my name and our wedding date, in a nice shade of blue, which my mother will sew into the hem of my wedding dress.  And a sixpence for your shoe:  See above.

       10 Days  I keep repeating to myself,  "Relax, relax.  Don't panic."   Mom is coming in to town tonight, so hopefully that will ease some of the pressure I'm feeling lately.

       A family distraction  Today my Mom and Dad are coming in from Rochester for the holiday weekend.  Already I have made big plans to keep us occupied.  I think tonight we'll have dinner at  urlLink The Great Lakes Brewing Company , since my Dad's never been before but has had to listen to my Mom and  urlLink Julia  and her parents gush about it.  Saturday, I will enlist my Dad's help to rip out the carpeting in the hallway, which Oscar has been using as a toilet recently.  Sunday we will celebrate Kevin's grandfather's 84th birthday, followed by a picnic and the last  urlLink Cleveland Orchestra  concert of the summer season at Blossom.  Should be fun stuff, and a much needed distraction from recent events.

       May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the crotch of the person who screws up your day and may their arms be too short to scratch.  Amen.  I think my Boss is looking to get out of the piano business, which means I also think I could be without a job in the near future.  We are so far in the financial hole these days, that the situation seems hopeless.  The Boss has been investigating  franchise opportunities for  urlLink Cold Stone Creamery  and  urlLink Quiznos Subs .  He's even been out scouting locations.  The other clue that makes me think something is up at work is what has been happening as far as our Year End routine goes.  Normally I go through all the books and make sure all the figures match each other, and match the inventory still on the floor.  This year Boss wants me to do everything completely different, including counting every book and brochure from the manufacturers we have.  In the 30 years this company has been in business, to the best of my knowledge, that has  never  been done before.  I just  know  something is going on.  Just what I need.

       Back in "school"  Last night Kevin's Mom and I attended our first of 12  urlLink Family to Family  classes.  This class has been described as "the light at the end of the tunnel" - a real life-saver.  That's what we're hopeful for.

       Merlin  When it rains, it pours.  Merlin's been in the hospital for several days now.  He went into surgery for a spinal tap yesterday, and the doctor found 2 broken vertebrae, some hip displaysia and a disease of some kind in his knees.  The good news is that eventually he will be ok, but recovery time will lat several months.

       To the dogs  We changed Lucy's name to Harley (my idea).  Kevin wanted something a little more "vicious" sounding for the little squirt.  He has his heart set on keeping her, but I'm not so sure yet.  That, and this morning Merlin had to go to Emergency for having excruciating pain in his hips.  He cried all night last night, and this morning couldn't move.  The vet gave him a shot but it didn't work, so Merlin goes back this afternoon.  Let's hope he won't have to have surgery.

       The world is her toilet  Now I remember why we have cats, and why we share Merlin with Lou (Merlin also was already potty trained before he belogned to us).  Lucy and the kitties got to know one another a little bit last night, before we went to bed.  There was some hissing, but no major incidents to speak of till I was awakened by  wet feet  at about 3 am this morning.  Yes, that's right.  Wet feet.  Lucy is too little to jump off the bed to make it to her puppy pad, so she peed on the bedspread.  Also she pooped on the bedspread.  So Kevin and I were up changing sheets at 3 am.  When my alarm went off at 6:45am, I got up, looked around, and discovered another little "deposit" on the floor near Kevin's side of the bed.  Things went downhill from there after Lucy ate breakfast.  I'll not go into anymore detail.

       I'm a sucker  We may have adopted another pet, to add to our "Family Petting Zoo".  In the words of my Mother-in-law:  "Are you nuts?"  Um, no, just a sucker for a stray animal.  Our neighbor down the street rescues dogs and cats, nurses them back to health, and finds homes for them.  Recently she found an abandoned Cockapoo, and last night while Kevin and I were out walking Merlin, we stopped by to say hello.  The puppy, Lucy, found her way to my feet and collapsed on the toes of my sneakers.  I bent down to pick her up, she licked my face, and I was in love.  So, today we brought her home for a "trial", to see how the cats will do with her.  Merlin already loves her after meeting her last night.  But he loves anyone who doesn't hiss at him and swat his face.

        got enough guilt to start my own religion...   Wow what a weekend.  I have to start first by highlighting the fact that we did indeed make it down to the Tori show on Saturday.  We launched the boat about 4:30, despite the small craft advisory which expired not long after we went out.  We cruised down the river a bit, which I was concerned about, because of the "millions of gallons of raw sewage released into the Cuyahoga River" during the Blackout (according to  urlLink The Plain Dealer ).  Luckily, there wasn't really a stench, just very brown water, which is normal.    We cruised by the concert venue just as Tori was finishing her Sound Check.  Never heard a Tori Sound Check before.  I was in Heaven!  I was so excited.  I got out the binoculars.  Lou coaxed Merlin up on the bow of the boat in the hopes that someone would see him (Tori) and want to come on the boat with us, or invite us up to her trailer, which we could see clearly from the water.  We were so close!  But I didn't want to be too obvious.  Yes, I had on my Tori T-Shirt, and yes, we were playing Tori CD's in the boat, and yes I was watching everything with the binoculars glued to my face.  Suddenly I felt like  a crazed stalker and got really paranoid that Tori would hate me if she found out I was "spying" on her.  So we left and cruised up the River some more, till it was show time.  We came back to the Amphitheater just as Ben Folds was finishing up his opening set.  We pulled the boat up as close as possible and slyly dropped anchor.  Which you are not supposed to do, anywhere in the River.  Then Lou said, "I wonder if she would be pissed that we didn't care enough buy tickets and instead are seeing the show for free...?"   I hadn't thought about that before.  Immediately I felt guilty.  That quickly subsided, however, when Tori bounced out on stage and I had the most perfect view of her throughout the entire show.  I couldn't have had better seats if I  had  purchased a ticket.   urlLink Go here to see the Set List and Concert Reviews.   Even Kevin got excited about this...clapping and whistling.  It was his very first Tori show.  I'm so proud!

       In the Dark  I suppose I should account for my experience with this blackout, but I am really sick of hearing about it.  I really would just like for our WATER to be restored.  I was at work yesterday afternoon when the power went off.  The drive home, which normally takes me 10 to 15 minutes, lasted 45 minutes because the idiots on the roads out here just barrel through the intersections without stopping first.    No one showed up to choir practice last night, presumeably because they were stuck downtown.  (We're going to have to wing it on Sunday.)  I went over to Kevin's grandmother's apartment last night to check on her and make sure she wasn't stuck in her electric recliner, which she wasn't, thankfully, and also to bring her a cooler and ice for her insulin.  My mother-in-law was nice enough to bring me a few gallons of gas for my car, since Kevin's car was stuck in the garage (electric), and we couldn't find the key to open the back door.  Kevin didn't have to work last night, so despite the heat, we went to bed relatively early.  Did I get any sleep?  Of course not.  Aside from it being a torrid 85 degrees in our bedroom, the wind-up alarm clock ticked away next to my ear all night long, keeping me awake.  The power finally came back on this morning about 5am.  Alas, however, we have only a trickle of water coming from the faucets.  Therefore, I was really unable to shower this morning, and as of this minute, there is still no water at our house that I know of.  I may have to go to Medina tonight, to shower at my mother-in-law's, because it's now 90 degrees outside and I STINK.    We're still going to see Tori tomorrow, though!  I wonder if there will be a Baby Boom nine months from now....

       Tori at Tower City  This weekend we have planned to go down to the Flats on the boat to hear Tori and Ben Folds at the  urlLink Tower City Amphitheater   the during the Cleveland leg of the  urlLink Lottapianos Tour .  We're supposed to go on the boat and hear the show from the river (for free!), but Lou is notorious for backing out of things at the last minute if he can find something "better" to do.  Kevin isn't strong enough yet to do the boat by himself, and I unfortunately still don't know what the hell I'm doing with that thing.  So, we wait in anticipation.  If we end up getting to go, I'm going to wave to Tori from the boat.  Maybe she'll want to take a ride around the river with us.

       Getting there  I know it's been a while since I last posted.  Things have been busy at home lately.  With Kevin recovering slowly from his hospital visit, I've got a lot of extra stuff to do at home until Kevin reaches 100% again.  This past weekend I nearly finished redoing the Master Bedroom...Gerry came over to help me paint.  We got the ceiling fan hung, and then on Sunday I ripped up the ratty old carpeting and padding, and pulled the staples and tack strips off the floor.  We now have   gorgeous  hardwood flooring in the bedroom.  Yesterday Gerry and I hung up the curtain rods and my red curtains.  The room is unrecognizable now, and I love it!

       stories  Had a very nice, but very busy weekend...full of surprises.   Beth ended up coming out not till Saturday morning, then we drove about a half hour South on 71 to go to the  urlLink Outlet Mall in Lodi .  What a gorgeous day to walk around outside.  I made a few purchases - I had wanted to get started on my picture frame shopping  (we're giving wedding photos as Christmas gifts) but Mikasa had jack.  I bought clothes instead, and a few more pieces of Pfaltzgraf to add to my collection.    So, we get home, and the phone rings, and it's  urlLink Julia .  This is how our conversation went:  Julia:   Hi!    Me:   Hi!  Julia:   Can you hear me ok?  I'm on my cell phone in the car.  Me:   Yeah.  What are you doing?  Julia:   Traveling.  Me:   Traveling?  Where are you?  Julia:   I'm on 480.    Me:   WHAT?    Julia:   What are you doing right now, because we'll be there in a half hour?  We had a good laugh over that one.  Inevitably, every time Julia and  urlLink Matt  come to visit, we have a new story to tell.     Saturday night we went to my favorite sportsbar Cleats - they have the best burgers I've ever had.  There was a group of 7 of us, 3 which were from New York.  We all got ID'd (even Gerry who is 40), but the management gave the New Yorkers the biggest hassle because of the out of state licenses.  Beth got a little irate, and I think probably could have punched the waitress in the face.    Sunday after church we went out to brunch where Kevin was lectured about smoking several times by the restaurant's owner.  He stood over our table explaining that he has had 4 heart attacks and detailed the specifics of his open heart surgery to poor Kevin who has been through enough health related issues as it is.  Meanwhile the rest of us tried to choke down the remainders of our breakfasts.    It was a good weekend.

I suppose I can only hope my own marriage will last as long as my parents', and survive as well as theirs has.  Speaking of which, my first anniversary technically is in three weeks.

       urlLink Courtney  and I occasionally swap recipes.  Here's the one I shared today:   Simple & Sweet Kielbasa Appetizer     Ingredients  2 lbs. Kielbasa 1 24 oz. jar applesauce*  1 medium onion, chopped 1 Cup brown sugar**   Directions  Preheat oven to 325.  Simmer Kielbasa for 20 minutes in about 1 inch of water.  Drain and cool to touch.  Slice kielbasa in to 1" pieces, on the slant.  Spray 9 x 13" baking dish with Pam.  Add kielbasa, onion, applesauce, and brown sugar.  Mix together well.  Bake uncovered 1 1/2 - 2 hours.    Makes a nice appetizer, but I've had it over brown rice with a salad, which is fantastic.  *You can use cinnamon applesauce if desired. **Use dark brown sugar with regular applesauce, or the light brown sugar if you use the cinnamon applesauce.  I think using the dark sugar with the cinnamon applesauce makes it just a little too sweet.    This is SO yummy.  Feel free to copy, and enjoy.

       happy fall  I love Autumn, but most especially I love Autumn food.  Ok, I love to eat no matter what time of year it is.  It's a wonder a don't weigh 200 pounds.  (Two jobs, 3 cats, 2 dogs and a husband keep me pretty active.)  I am so looking forward to apples - apple pies, apple crisp, etc.  I also have my food pet peeves.  I cannot tolerate foods flavored like other foods, i.e. Barbeque or Sour Cream & Chive flavored potato chips, strawberry flavored applesauce, grape flavored bubble gum, anything flavored orange or banana.  You get the idea.  To me, these are the grossest foods imaginable.

       I have to come to work to recover from the weekend  Friday night was wedding rehearsal night, after which I was exhausted.  It was a long week.    Saturday, the wedding I played for was a piece of cake, if rather boring.  All the Brides like the same music, wedding after wedding, regardless of how tedious it is for us church musicians to play the same thing (Canon in D) over and over again.  I'm sick of it, really.  I played extremely well, except for a little problem I had with the Principal stop on the Great sticking, which was easily remedied by a registration change.  (Our organ is the most archaic piece of CRAP imaginable.)   Saturday night we went to Lou's 25t birthday party.  Good food, but obnoxious Romanian relatives, who were all dressed to the nines for an outdoor picnic...ties, 3" stilettos, tons of make up and perfume.  Ick.  One lady was even wearing a green leather business suit.     Sunday after church Kevin and I spent most of the afternoon with Harley at the Akron Emergency Vet Hospital.  Turns out she has a urinary tract infection that probably could have waited till today for her to see our family vet, but I was a little concerned (ok, PANICKED) because of the urination of blood happening with her.    Needless to say I got nothing accomplished over the weekend around the house or the yard.  This week is just as busy as last week with Kevin's doctor's appointments, more Vet appointments, and Beth's visit possible on Friday for this weekend.  Sheesh!

       the effects of Isabel  It has been raining for about 14 hours straight in Cleveland.  Today is the first day since May that I've worn a long-sleeved shirt to work, socks, and actual shoes rather than sandals.  This is how I know Autumn is right around the corner.  The Hurricane headlines amuse me, because my cat is also named Isabel.   Darkenss, Death in Isabel's Wake ,  Isabel Leaves 13 Dead ,  Isabel Still Cutting Power in its Path , etc.  While I realize to some the situation is grave, I can't help but chuckle just a little, because these headlines make it sound like my baby kitty is terrorizing the entire East Coast.

        fall onto me onto her fall onto me the sky's crimson tears   It's almsot Autumn here.  This is my favorite time of year because the seasonal change is never so apparent as it is in Autumn.  Some of the trees have brown and orange poking out a little already.  I think I'm ready for it this year, ready to embrace it.  I used to try to fight it off, which is silly, because everyone knows you can't fight Mother Earth.  But this year, something feels different.  It feels like there's a hidden message in the cold, brisk air of these mornings.    (I still despise Halloween, though, which I will probably never get over...too traumatic during childhood and the teenage years.)

       Busy-ness  I have such a busy week....meeting with the pastor tonight, class tomorrow, Choir on Thursday, a wedding rehearsal Friday night, then Saturday I'm playing a wedding.  No rest for the weary, I suppose.  Pretty soon it will be Christmas!  I thought I was going to be able to get church stuff done at work this morning because Boss was supposed to have gone to Philly.  Turns out his wife got sick at the last second, which always happens, so the trip has been postponed.  Boy was I surprised at 9:30 when he came in and I have church paperwork spread everywhere on my desk.  Oops!  So Boss also brings in his hulking yellow lab Duke, who has subsequently slobbered all over my new shiny red-burgundy pants.  I told Boss he owed me a new wardrobe, since inevitably I always wear new clothes the same day Duke visits.  Go figure.

       herbal tea drinkers beware  I just love the little news teasers  urlLink MSN  puts on my Sent Mail page.  This morning it was  "Herbal Tea Linked to Seizures?"   Being a regualr consumer of herbal tea, of course that caught my attention and almost caused a little panic.  So I click on the link, which takes me to  urlLink this article on MSNBC .  Turns out only drinking  Japanese star anise  tea is dangerous, according to the FDA.  All that worry for nothing.  I've never even  heard  of Japanese star anise tea, let alone consumed it.  Why do people do this?  Why do these idiots give news stories headlines which are completley unrelated to the story?  I honestly thought I was going to have to stop drinking herbal tea to avoid having seizures.  Geezus.

        "come back i'll show you the roses that brush off the snow and open their petals again and again"    I find it extremely funny how things from the past can come back to you at any time.  (Not funny hah hah, funny odd.)  Everything has its season Everything has its time Show me a reason and I'll soon show you a rhyme Cats fit on the windowsill Children fit in the snow Why do I feel I don't fit in anywhere I go?  Rivers belong where they can ramble Eagles belong where they can fly I've got to be where my spirit can run free Got to find my corner of the sky  Every man has his daydreams Every man has his goal People like the way dreams have Of sticking to the soul Thunderclouds have their lightning Nightingales have their song And don't you see I want my life to be  Something more than long....  Rivers belong where they can ramble Eagles belong where they can fly I've got to be where my spirit can run free Got to find my corner of the sky  So many men seem destined  To settle for something small But I won't rest until I know I'll have it all So don't ask where I'm going Just listen when I'm gone And far away you'll hear me singing Softly to the dawn:  Rivers belong where they can ramble Eagles belong where they can fly I've got to be where my spirit can run free Got to find my corner of the sky

       good days  I went to the third  urlLink NAMI  sponsored Family to Family class last night.  The facilitators had some time set aside for everyone to tell their "stories" - why they were there, attending the class.  I went toward the end, but when it was my turn, I felt relieved, in a way.  Out of the 25 or so people attending the class, I'm probably one of the luckiest ones....my situation is not nearly as bad as other people's.  So many of the other people, who were there either for their children or their parents rather than spouses, told stories of suicidal tendencies, police restraint, disappearances, etc.  Horrible, horrible things.  None of which I really had to go through, other than Kevin's hospitalization.  Thankfully.   Maybe my story will provide the others with  some  hope - that there are medications that will work.  Kevin is living proof of that.  I think we're almost back to being in a good place.  On another positive note, we're actively planning a little weekend getaway for our first anniversary next month.  (I love it -  we celebrate our first anniversary only 2 months after our wedding.  Heh!)  Well, I am, really.  As a surprise for Kevin.  I'm looking at a little Bed & Breakfast in Amish Country.     And...   I'm also excited for the new Tori Amos album coming out in November - a "best of".  I hope it's good, because I would hate to have to call her a sell-out.   urlLink Amazon  already has a listing for  urlLink Tales of a Librarian .  We will see!

        How far do our feelings take their colour from the dive underground?  I mean, what is the reality of any feeling?  -Virginia Woolf

       even more depressed  I just found out my co-worker's wife died this morning of cancer.  She had been ill for a long time, but I don't think that prepared any of us at all, really.  I didn't know Pam at all, but I've worked with her husband for 3 years.  I started thinking about what it would be like to lose my own spouse.  In a way I already have, because mental illness takes a person away almost entirely.  All I'm left with is someone who looks like my husband, but who is a complete stranger to me.  It's a living nightmare, really.  Now I think about how I will react when it's time for my parents to go, and how will each of them react to the other's passing?  Scary stuff.  I'm not ready for any of it, mostly because I still feel like I'm 12 years old sometimes and couldn't possibly survive without my parents in my life.

       blah, blah, blah; bored, bored, bored  Here's one thing I really hate about my job: when business is slow, I have nothing to do.  I've been entertaining myself with the Internet for the last 2 hours, eagerly awaiting lunch time.  14 minutes to go.  Still no word on whether Boss is closing up shop.  I know I'll have a job at least through the end of the month, since we have some events planned.  But after that, I don't know.    This weekend I plan to catch up on some things around the house, and get myself organized for the new Choir year at church.  I had planned to do that over the holiday weekend, but I was distracted first by my parents, and then by the neighborhood girls who wanted to come over and play with Harley, Merlin, and the cats.  (I did get carpeting ripped up in the hallway, though.)    I want to try to get to Columbus in the next week or two, to get the first of my  urlLink Reiki  treatments from my Aunt, who has recently become a Certified Reiki Practitioner.  Some people think healing with energy is a lot of hocus pocus, but I really believe in it.  And, I'll try anything to relieve the stress in my life, because it's just about unbearable at times.

       I think to be a part of music, music is something that chooses us, and it is truly an elixir. I've never experienced anything in my life like music, because it doesn't um make demands in a way that a relationship does. I do feel like it's boundless and endless. And when I've read that there's tone out in the galaxy... I was reading somewhere the other day that there was a place that had a B-Flat, that was its tone, one of my favourite keys, and I just was thinking to myself, the idea, the sounds that the universe makes, creates, and we're a part of that, when we want to give up and have a hard day, or we feel like we don't fit here on the planet, we have this opportunity to be part of creativity and that is just... that's why we're here.  --Tori Amos

      I'm pretty sure I've been firewalled out of my e-mail from work.  Their little passive aggressive way of controlling things, I suppose, since no one ever told me I  couldn't  check e-mail from work.  Blah.  The realtor came over on Sunday, went through the house and told me everything I'm doing wrong in my housekeeping.  Well, of course I know I should clean up the cat hair that collects on the basement stairs, but when you work 55-60 hours a week, who has time for that?  I saw some article somewhere on things you should do to help your house sell.  These things include rolling your towels instead of folding them, to make your bathroom seem like a spa.  Which I did, but don't tell anyone.  It also suggested baking a pie for a nostalgic, comforting effect.  Again, who has time for that crap?  The realtor also came back this morning to take pictures for the internet and to put a lock box on the door.  I cannot imagine other people coming into my house and looking in my closets and cupboards.  How creepy.    Our first Open House is this Sunday.    To make matters worse, Boss renigged on letting me have the day after Thanksgiving off.  Originally we had planned to go to Columbus for a somewhat long weekend with my aunt, my mother, my sister and her boyfriend.  I can forget about that now.  I am really pissed off about that, because this was the only thing I had to look forward to.  So I cried in the bathroom for 10 minutes after he told me I couldn't have the day off.    Unbelievable.  Things just get worse by the day.  And I'm not looking for pity, I just feel like shit lately - run down and unmotivated to do anything, let alone try to keep a positive attitude about any of this.    Somebody kick me in the ass, will ya?

      Yesterday the planets in my world seemed to be aligned for the first time in ages.  Everything sort of fell in to place, and miraculously, I was relaxed!  (I'm sure it was no coincidence that after I had mentioned to a co-worker how great it would be if someone brought in Halloween candy, more specifically, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which are my favorite, that one of the students ACTUALLY HAD brought them in.)  Divine intervention it was.  And at home things were good last night.  Today is a different story.  I think my planets are maligned, judging by how my morning went.  Got up, stepped out of bed right in to a huge pile of cat puke.  In bare feet.  Ick.  I turned on the light to look around, and it was ALL OVER the floor next to my side of the bed.  I felt like I was in a horror movie.    Now I can't for the life of me get into my Hotamail account because apparently the web site is experiencing technical difficulties.  Yet, through the use of company e-mailed I've discovered that my daily e-mail buddy isn't having any problems with his account.  Grr!  I'm maligned.

      Where does one draw the line between being honest and being tactful, and not feel guilty for doing so?  Someone once told me that you cannot force a person to feel guilty - that person creates his or her own feelings of guilt and chooses to feel them or not feel them.  I don't know how much truth there is in that statement.  I know I personally do not have that much control over my feelings.  I feel what I feel, when I feel it, based on the surrounding circumstances.  I suppose the only way, then, to control my feelings would be to also control the circumstances which affect them.  Ha!    And now to get into a little he-said/she-said heresy:  yesterday my husband told me that my mother-in-law told him that I said my friends thought I should leave him.  Which of course did not happen, nor would it ever, I suspect.  I suppose I should just leave this one alone, but where on earth does Mother-in-law get off making such presumptions?  Grr!  And do I confront her about it?  I've learned that with her, all I can do is take what she says at mere face value.

      At least the dogs get along.    Bad day...a pumpkin rots all over my table and leaves a stink throughout the entire house.  The grass needs mowed, the dishes need washing, the laundry needs washing, and I am unmotivated.  I know moving is the best possible thing I could do for us...for our marriage at this point, if even that is to be saved.    I have always believed that things happen for a reason.  I don't necessarily believe in pre-destination, but I do think I am on a particular path.  My choices affect that, of course, but I think eventually I will get to go where it is I'm meant to go.  My choices just may postpone me getting there.  And I'm sure I'm supposed to learn along the way.  Today at work a customer felt the need to tell me her life story on the phone -   her son had recently been beaten within an inch of his life, and consequently she was so depressed she tried to kill herself.  Now why people feel the need to unburden themselves on me, I don't know.  But one thing she said struck me:  "Heidi, I've been through hell."   Lady, you don't know what hell is.

       wisdom comes from all places  Isn't it amazing that George Carlin - mouthy comedian of the 70's and 80's, could write something so very eloquent ...and so very appropriate:   A wonderful Message by George Carlin:   The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less; we buy more, but enjoy less.   We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.  We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years.  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.  We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.  We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.   These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to  kill.   It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.  Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever.  Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.  Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.   Remember, to say, "I love you" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all  mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.   Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.  Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away.   Courtesy of Mike, and found in my inbox this morning.  A good way to start the day.

        You are Bobby. Full name: Robert Francis Kennedy. Nickname: RFK. A graduate of the University of Virginia Law School, you were the Attorney General of the US from 1960-1963. You are most well known for your passionate crusading for human and civil rights. People basically either loved you or hated you. You served as a US Senator for a few years, until you ran for President in 1967. You were assasinated in 1968 in the kitchen of a California hotel. Your 11 children, all who loved you very much, took your death hard. The deaths of two of your children are considered by many to have been a direct result of the trauma of *your* death.    urlLink   Which Kennedy Male Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      One of my very favorite contemporary Classical music composers,  urlLink John Corigliano  has released a new Concerto, according to  urlLink this interview from The Associated Press .   The reason why I like Corigliano so much is probably because he's one of the few composers I've actually met, in addition to   urlLink Lukas Foss  and  urlLink Pauline Oliveros .  While still at  urlLink B-W  I was fortunate to meet Foss and Corigliano during  urlLink FOCUS Festival  events.  I attended a Masterclass given by Oliveros during my senior year, and since there were, maybe, 10 of us in the class, there was a lot of one-on-one time with the composer herself.  Anyway, Corigliano, in my opinion, has an impressive oevre, from song cycles (with text by Dylan Thomas...yum!), to concerti, to symphonies, to film scores, including  urlLink The Red Violin , which I love.

       It's official...  2 things: First, Kevin is now, happily, employed full time by  urlLink The City of Brecksville .  His first day on the job was yesterday and he LOVED it.  Thank God.    Second, this week I am in Television Heaven because of all the programming on the Kennedys.  This Saturday, the 22nd, marks the 40th anniversary of JFK's assassination, which means there are actually decent programs to watch on TV other than the usual mindless network fluff.    So, last night I was watching  urlLink American Experience:  The Kennedys  on  urlLink PBS  when I got a phone call at 10pm.  It was  urlLink Sue  calling to tell me Andy proposed to her Sunday night!  CONGRATULATIONS! YAY!

       shiver  We have not had heat in the office all week.  Today I am huddled so close to the space heater under my desk, I will probably ignite my sweater.  My fingers are practically frozen to my keyboard this morning, as it is a frigid 60 degrees in here.  It feels like someone left all the windows open over night.    The repair guys have been unable to fix the heating system, since that involves climbing up on the roof, and since we have had such high winds here, they have been reluctant to do any work.   urlLink (Go here to read about damage caused by the tornado touchdown in Wooster.)   Incidentally, the winds were so high Wednesday night, they blew our backyard fence down.  They also blew away the Century 21 sign in the front yard.  Kevin asked me if we still had to sell the house since the sign is now gone.  Yes, yes we do.  *chuckles*

      point of grace that heady feeling returns only for a moment and i go back to a time of lesser everything a walk around the block alone together in the calm in the dark with you two paths once on the same journey created by years sustained by memories forging on still because we do not know what is ahead of us our two lights across an expanse of meadow, of highway, of city i can feel the distance next to me the unquiet mind the lost hope; the emptiness and abandon the unwanted life that hangs on  to what it only remembers to be real all of it is nothing anymore there is no life in this breath there is no meaning in covenant a face merely exists; a body's mass inches apart yet miles away and slowly i drift as you just watch me go  -hew 11/7/03

      It's getting chilly here again.  I think I can safely put away the grill for the winter.  Last night we had our last bbq and I stood outside shivering in Husband's jean jacket while I flipped burgers.  Brr.    I have choir practice tonight, to which I ordinarily look forward, except this year has been different.  I realize everyone has 'stuff' going on in their lives, but people just can't seem to leave it outside the door when they come in for rehearsal.  The last few weeks have been nothing but bitching and moaning, complaining and negativity.  I am tired of it.  Regardless of how bad things get in my own life, I try to keep my complaints to myself, because life is too short to be in a sour mood all the time, and it's contagious.  So I say to them, 'walk a mile in my shoes, and then you can have bitching rights.'  On the agenda for the weekend...packing and cleaning, cleaning and packing, and another Open House on Sunday.  I can't wait.  *snort*

      Busy, busy, busy.  We're showing the house this afternoon, and again tomorrow evening.  These realtors want to come in at the most inconvenient times.  Last night, I got a call asking to come in this morning and I had to put my foot down and say 'no way'.  Saturday morning is the only time I have to enjoy myself and get anything done around here.  So they're coming about 2.  Tomorrow we're showing at 5.  Dinner time.  Fantastic.    So, last night I gave in.  Kevin previously had agreed with me that we'd skip trick-or-treat last night, keep the lights off, and hunker down in front of the TV.  I think he was reluctant to talk to the nosy neighbors about us moving.  Certainly everyone has seen the big honking Century 21 sign in the front yard, but we haven't really talked to the neighbors since it went up.  Anyway, I think Kevin wanted to avoid having to answer too many questions, and understandably so.    But last night, right before I left work, he called me to tell me he had changed his mind and would I stop and pick up some candy on the way home.  That was at 4.  Trick-or-treat started at 6.  So I hit Drugmart on the way home.  They were out.  Then I went to Tops.  They were out.  I came home, we ate dinner, and made a mad dash for Giant Eagle.  They were nearly cleaned out, but we managed to get a few bags (7) of candy.  We got home just in time.  Not a lot of kids this year, but I didn't hide in the house like last year and make Kevin do it alone.  It was nice enough outside that we sat out on the front steps for several hours.  Kevin and 80s Frank had their celebratory beers, and I had my mug of chai.  The kids looked great.  I am still bothered by the fact that no one rings the doorbell here.  They just stand out there and yell "trick-or-treat".  However, this year, hardly any of the kids even said  that .  Most of them just walked up the driveway to us, thrust their pillowcases in our faces, and stared at us.  Some of them sort of grunted pre-historically till we gave up the candy, but most didn't say 'trick-or-treat' at all.  Greedy little buggers.

       Gemini May 21 - June 20 Relations with partners of all kinds - business, romantic, creative - might be somewhat strained today, dear Gemini. You and the other parties involved could have been under a lot of stress, and you might find yourselves snapping at each other. It might be a good idea to keep contact between you and your partners at a minimum. If you can't, try to be cordial and cooperative - even if you don't feel like it!   HA!

      i'm over the anger i'm over the ways we used to hurt each other without trust   I'm trying to tell you something about my life Maybe give me insight between black and white The best thing you've ever done for me Is to help me take my life less seriously, it's only life after all Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable And lightness has a call that's hard to hear I wrap my fear around me like a blanket I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it, I'm crawling on your shore.   I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in crooked line The less I seek my source for some definitive The closer I am to fine.    so i hear this song on the radio on the way to work this morning it's something i haven't heard in years not since that time you reached for your guitar  and we sang   perfectly in tune  and i was stunned  there were nights we went to bed early the two of us side by side on a twin mattress the only thing that connected us was the music   I went to see the doctor of philosophy With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee He never did marry or see a B-grade movie He graded my performance, he said he could see through me I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper And I was free.   I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in crooked line The less I seek my source for some definitive The closer I am to fine.    we sang four years fought fiercely for the song changed cheated embraced just to get through it   I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m. To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend I woke up with a headache like my head against a board Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before I went in seeking clarity.   I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in crooked line The less I seek my source for some definitive The closer I am to fine.    then we were on our own together but separate out there in a fresh yet unforgiving place the beginning of the end of that song that you started that i finished  two parts became a solo   We go to the bible, we go through the workout We read up on revival and we stand up for the lookout There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line The less I seek my source for some definitive The closer I am to fine The closer I am to fine The closer I am to fine    closer to fine

      Three of my girlfriends and I had a marvelous time at the very opulent, Art-Deco  urlLink Severance Hall  last night.  We heard Beethoven's 2nd Symphony in D Major, the Mendelssohn E Minor Violin Concerto, and Respighi's  Church Windows .  I thought it was a good program, if a bit tired at times, but maybe that's just because it was a Tuesday night.  I have to say that I enjoyed the Respighi the most.  I have a more contemporary taste in classical music.  I love the late-Romantic, neo-Classical music that was written at the turn of the last century and in the early 1900's, as well as even more recent music (i.e. Lauridsen and Corigliano).  Musically I think it's because it's less "organized" than earlier music.  In music from the Classical period, everything is so clearly defined....first you have the introduction, the main theme, the secondary theme, maybe even a tertiary theme.  All the rhythmic motives are established.  Then there's the development, the recapitulation, maybe a coda.  Everything is so strict tonally and rhythmically.  What I like about more contemporary music is that it's less rigid.  I can focus more on the soundscape of it and not get distracted by its structural form.  And there's your theory lesson for the day...

      I'm hanging out at work for a little while longer tonight, since no one is here to cover me when I leave at the moment.    Kevin and I had a wild and crazy weekend.  Sort of.  Let's call it 'emotionally charged' instead.  A list of interesting and notable things that happened:  1.  After depositing his paycheck on Friday, Kevin noticed that there was an error in his bank account balance.  Or so we think.  But neither of us knows anyone nice enough to just give us a SUBSTANTIAL amount of money without saying anything about it.  This is leaving us in agony since the banks are closed today and we won't be able to figure this thing out till tomorrow.  What would you do if the bank made a huge error in your favor?    2.  Being the sucker for animals that I am, I rescued yet another stray kitten.  But I am NOT keeping her!  She needs a home!  A gorgeous cinnamon-colored little bag of bones....undernourished and exhausted...she must have found a way to get into the garage to keep from freezing to death.   3.  More arguments with the in-laws.  'nuff said.

        Better to light one candle than to curse the darkness...   Think about that one for a while.  Yesterday I told my boss I would be leaving.  Eventually.   There are so many factors to consider...which I don't feel like discussing now, but will have to confront sooner or later.  So, boss told me that when I leave he would like 30 days notice.  Ha!  He'll be lucky if he gets 2 weeks.  Boss also told me that business is really as bad as I thought it was so my position will go to part-time after I'm gone - 2 or 3 days a week.  I suppose I should feel lucky he didn't decide to make it part-time a year ago.    Still no word from my in-laws.   I wonder how people get away with behaving so poorly.  I am desperately looking forward to hearing the  urlLink Cleveland Orchestra  on Tuesday.  A friend of mine occasionally gets free tickets through work and always invites me.  Don't tell anyone but I have just a slight crush on the Concert Master.

      Looking for a new job sucks.   I haven't had to do it in several years so I feel like I'm out of the loop.  Also my education doesn't qualify me for much.  What do you do with a music degree?  Go back to school.  I'm just interested in so many things...art, literature, music, health, the outdoors,ministry...the list goes on.  ARGH!  Not to mention the job market blows everywhere.  I'm so encouraged.  I mopped the basement floor tonight.  I also packed boxes of dishes than I haven't used since the last time we moved.  The approach of the inevitable...

      Brrrr..... Coldness. Packing today...lots of packing to do.  I am so unmotivated since we are not dealing with the most ideal of situations.    I need to find another home for Oscar and his continence problems, because they keep getting worse.  There may be a call to the APL today.  :o(

      I am going out with a bang.  After today, I have one more day of work, and one more Sunday to play.  Then I'm done.    We are in lock-down mode at work - Boss is distracted and panicky.  He's not taking any phone calls, let alone visitors.  Of the auditor-type.  He insists that all the doors to the offices stay closed and LOCKED.  There is so much negative energy in here one could choke; it's a foul vibe.  Can you say "Bankruptcy"?  Thank God I am getting out when I am.  Let's just hope I get a paycheck tomorrow.  I have been without my car all week and 80s Frank is ignoring Kevin and me, I think.  On Sunday, he volunteered to replace my faulty thermostat and flush out the radiator (yeah, I sound like I know what I'm talking about).  However, since then he hasn't returned any of Kevin's phone calls.  Kevin is rather pissed off, because this means he has to get up early to drive me to work and to choir practice.  If Frank didn't want to do the side job (FOR CASH!), why not just say so?  It could have been done by now.  I need my car by tomorrow afternoon, because there is no freaking way I am making my husband pick up his own g-d birthday cake.

       my food heaven   If ever you are given the opportunity to sample  homemade  Chinese food, do NOT pass it up.  Fabulicious.  Victoria/Ning (which is what I call her, since she's not sure if she prefers her American or her Chinese name) brought me the most wonderful chicken and green peppers dish last night.  I wolfed it down in about 2 minutes before choir practice.  My parents came into town last night, so tonight we begin the 3-week long celebration of Kevin's birthday.  We'll have dinner tonight at  urlLink Eddie's Creekside , where my parents are sure to make me look bad with the birthday-gift-giving that will take place.  Details on the presents to follow, since I'm not sure if Kevin reads this or not.  He won't tell me.  By the way - I am DONE with my outlaws.  Done as done can be.

      Oh my God.  Last night was a colossal waste of time.  I think the outlaws already knew we were moving to Rochester, because after we told them, the first thing my mother in law asked was if Kevin could still get Disability.  And that pretty much set the tone for the evening....everything either came back to money, or to them.    We were told we need to grow up.  She told me I have a problem with female authority figures, and she called me a puppet master.  She insulted my mother and my sister.  She complained that she didn't get even a Christmas card (we didn't send them to anyone) and she complained that she didn't get any wedding pictures (neither did anyone else).  She told Kevin that if he didn't come back to Cleveland for my father in law's 50th birthday party, she would never speak to him again.  My father in law said we could move to China for all he cares.    Every time I tried to express how I felt about this, I was belittled or mocked.  Basically the way everything went was that I would say how I felt about something, she would retaliate with something completely unrelated, and I had to defend myself.  Nothing we said was considered with respect.  I brought up the lying, which she said she didn't do.  I brought up her coming to my work, with which she saw no problem whatsoever.  She also made it abundantly clear that she blames me for Kevin's psychological break and hospitalization - because of all the stress I put on him from the wedding.  She said this all started when she refused to let invite my 30 extra choir members to the wedding.  (About which she is absolutely right, because it was then that I took control of my wedding and we decided to do things our way.)    I feel defeated.  I tried my very best.  I was calm and non-accusatory.  I didn't place blame on anyone, but she didn't even listen to what I had to say.  Kevin spoke up twice, but it wasn't enough.  She thinks I don't allow him to call her or to visit her.  She thinks when we move I will forbid him to have anything to do with her.  I tried to tell her that is just not how I am, but the whole conversation was her disparaging me and picking apart my character flaws.  It was awful.  I feel like we accomplished nothing, and I'm obsessing over it now because I'm trying to rationalize in my head that she is a logical person, but she isn't.  I think she is completely disillusioned.    *Sigh*

      I feel like it's Doomsday.  There is some good news, which is that our house is sold.  Finally.  The unsettling part is that tonight we are meeting with my "out-law's" for some discussion time.  They don't know we are moving to New York yet.  It is a very complicated situation, so I'm rather anxious and nervous.  I hope it goes well.

      It turns out that the nosy-looking-in-my-car-windows-people-who-almost-caused-our-groceries-to-spoil are really interested in the house.  So much so that they came back to look again yesterday afternoon.  I met them this time, too.  Not as bad as they had appeared to be, though their Realtor seemed ticked off that I had to come home to grab my briefcase.  I had forgotten it yesterday morning in my rush to get out the door to get to work.  Usually I just keep it in my car, since it's just choir music.  I only use it a few times a week, not necessarily every day.  But, of course, the one day I forget it....  So I stopped home on my way to choir practice to get my briefcase.  The couple who is interested in the house seemed nice - early 30s with a toddler who was wearing one of those Jester/Sideshow Bob looking-type hats with the jingle bells on the ends of the points.  Cute.  He really wanted to play with the dog, but she was hyper and I was not willing to risk this kid getting his nose bitten just for the sake of schmoozing with the prospective buyers. Not to mention I was running late for rehearsal anyway.  The girl who is replacing me as Music Director at church was at practice last night.  I don't know what all the fuss was about- the committee who hired wasn't sure they liked her much.  I thought she was very sweet. And, just the mere fact that she wanted to cook me Chinese food before rehearsal next week made me fall totally in love with her!  She's a little shy, but I think she will do fine.  Of course, no one will do as well as me, but she's maybe the next best thing, so I think I'll feel comfortable leaving.  Kind of.  Well, not really.  I'm sad about leaving that job...I think it's truly an uncommon thing to really LOVE your job, and love everything about it.  Those people who do are very fortunate.

      I would just like to announce that selling a house is the BIGGEST PAIN IN THE ASS.   We have done 3 showings since Sunday, which is good, however, I would prefer that these Realtors stick to their schedules.    Yesterday our Realtor called me at work to tell me there would be a showing between 6 and 7pm.  Fine.  Kevin and I had planned to go  to  urlLink Marc's  anyway, to pick up some groceries.  We rushed through dinner and we were out the door by 5:45.  At 7:15 we turned the corner on to our street and discovered 2 strange cars parked in the driveway.  Not only is that an odd feeling, but it feels even more weird to see strange people walking around in your garage looking in your freaking car windows.  NEWSFLASH:  THE CAR DOES NOT COME WITH THE HOUSE!!!!    Kevin and I had to drive around the block for 15 minutes until everyone left, praying the whole time the groceries wouldn't spoil.  I have half a mind to call the Realtor and bitch her out.  I'm probably overreacting which I have been doing a lot lately, but I'm STRESSED and fed up with all this bullshit.  I can't wait to move.

       death by Purple Moon  I am suffering from a massive wine hangover this morning.

I owe the government taxes this year. 2.  Boss may not have enough cash this week to even make payroll.

       Full Report  Not only did I have fun at the Baby Shower, but I'm almost positive Meg, Carrie, and I almost got KICKED OUT of said Baby Shower.  I think we were the only ones having a good time.  At one point we were laughing so loudly, several dirty looks were shot in our direction.  *smirk*    Aside from missing the exit off the Turnpike and my car nearly overheating on the way down, it was a good time.    *****************************************************************************  This afternoon I am going to my very first Baby Shower.  For my friend who is my age who is pregnant.  Since it is snowing like crazy here in Cleveland, I am hoping that the weather is better in Akron and Youngstown.  I'm going to meet Meg in Akron first, and since I have no idea how to get to Youngstown, we're going to caravan together to the shower.    I find it terribly hard to believe that already my friends are breeding.  I felt the clock ticking a few years ago, but I think now my clock batteries have run out of juice or something.  No ticking for the last year!  Much to my husband's glee.    So last night we were in  urlLink Babies R Us  where ME is registered.  Husband felt a little nervous, I think.  I took note of how everything looked the same.  Except for the cool present I got ME.  I hope she likes it.  Full report, hopefully, tomorrow, as well as the latest capers of my infamous "out-law's" as they will now be called from here on.

      It always astonishes me how much people can change when you don't see them every day.  Or even every year.  And I mean physically change.    So, last night I was at Six Pockets with Kevin, Scott, and Lauren playing darts.  At one point, Scott turns to me and says, "Do you recognize that girl over there?"  So I look, and I  do  recognize her.  Vaguely.  After thinking about it, I remembered exactly who she is.  Someone I used to be friends with in high school, but someone to whom I haven't spoken in several years.  And I mean several.  She will remain nameless, but the last time I saw her, she was thin.  She is now FAT.  (Or, as Beth would say,   fatter than whale shit .)  I'm so glad I've stayed the same weight since high school.  Otherwise, people would be blogging about me!  (Ah.....self-flattery....)

However, I thought the food was better than the musical.  We went for dinner at a place called  urlLink LaMaquette .  Next time you visit Toronto, you MUST go there.

Called the storage place in Cleveland for sending me a letter that said my unit is not secure (OH NO!!!!!!) 7.  Paid about 100 bills 8.  Wrote letters to my attorneys to find out what's up with my case (still no answer yet)

       Among the many gems I re-discovered while unpacking...   From March, 1997:   urlLink Julia , Rochester Matt, Sue, and me - at Java's-   Me:    I think that my thoughts should be elsewhere.  Somewhere in perhaps  O H I O, and the amber waves of grain and such.  No.  I'll not think of such a wretched place.  I'll think of ...   Julia:   ... beautifully wrenching figures.  Or perhaps not.  There's water there that flows through center and back.  Sliding over rocks that have lost all sharp edges with time.  Time transforming the molecules of water into one ...   Matt:    flowing moss, containing bits of all it as consumed on its path.                                    oh god The twit is still there.  Her mouth opening and closing and she has to be talking to me (is it appropriate to say we're having a conversation when I haven't said a word?)  for quite some time.  And I have no idea, nor  care, about what she has said.  Then suddenly, either because she has finished her thought or run out of air, she stops and looks at me.  I know she wants a response.  After an uncomfortable silence I open my mouth and say ...   Sue:   ... Screw you, you stupid whore.  {Sue is always subtle.}   You never liked me, I never liked you, so why after 5 years are you now standing here wasting my time with this mindless gibberish?  I don't care that you're a NAIL TECHNICIAN at Sears.  And you don't care that I'm going to grad school - if you even know what that is.  And don't worry - I won't be spreading gossip about you when I see my friends.  I don't care enough about you for you to even enter my mind.  Ever.  And I don't care WHAT you say about me.  Tell everyone I screwed the Queen of England for all I care.  Now get out of my face, get out of my space, get a life, and get out of mine!    Me:    Much better.  And now that she's gone and I am peacefully alone, I light another cigarette and start to think again.  I think that red is the best color of all.  I am unconquerable when I wear red.  On the contrary.  It is I who does the conquering.  Passion is red.  And it is hot and longing.  I am wet with passion.  But what if ...     Julia:   ... it became a river...a river starting quietly and gently as a babbling brook.  The brook flowing into a winding river that flows around curves in the earth.  Moving toward an uncertain point.  The current picking up as if following a metronome that clicks faster.  Tumbling over rocks and churning up in some kind of frenzy eventually spilling over into a gorge, water splashing up and catching the light in one final chorus ...   Matt:   ... Water equates life, I conclude with another sip of tea.  Nurturing but potentially deadly...too much or too little will kill you.  A precious balance must be kept, just as in life.  Balance ...God...what do I know about that?  I tend to lead a life of excess, or at least I think I do.  But didn't all the great minds always engage in excess?  What's wrong with occasionally pushing the envelope, like yesterday when ...   Sue:   ... I went hang-gliding off of the Rockies.  God, it was a beautiful thing.  Soaring with the hawks, and all of my troubles below...  But alas, that was only a dream.  What did I actually do yesterday?  I wish I could remember.  But of course, living in the present is the best way, and living for the future is the American Way.  Where is there room for the past?  In a book full of memories, good and bad, that is where the past is kept, safely locked away, so it cannot repeat, or even tell its story.  There is too much in the past to tell.  Too much much in the future to be missed if we dwell in the past, right?  So tomorrow I will ...   Me:   ... pretend to know what I'm talking about.  Why is it that I so desperately want to have a one track mind?  And why is it that it is never possible to think one thought at a time?  Why must it be that the backs of all these heads look like his?  And oh how I want them to be him.  All of them.  So that I may face myself when I face him.  I know this will never be so; for I am three parts female but only 1 part male.  And I ask, what is this damned maleness I feel but barely see? ...   Julia    That one part male in the stereotypical male lusts.  For life.  Oh I see...YOU are the one with the one track mind.  I keep getting distracted and held captivated by a look.  As I look up and try to interrupt with my eyes.  I am successful and laugh inwardly.  I remember a summer or scene or two here.  Time is suspended  in Java, literally .  The same people, only altered slightly.  I have always been here, it seems.  And although...    Matt:   ... time passes, as it must, and he and I change, as we must.  There is always that constant.  The water, the dreams of what I might do if I had the chance (and wasn't scared), even that shallow, skanky bitch who just graced me with her presence: they are all constants.  They are the things that help define me and my existence.   Great.  Now my cup is empty and Miss "Overly-Helpful-Let-Me-Get-You-Something-When-You-Don't-Need-It" is nowhere to be seen.  And the counter is too far away to walk.  Oh, God's gifts to white trash are leaving.  I work hard to make eye contact with Little Miss Blue Light Nail Decorating Special.  I'm wearing red so this is easy to do 'cause of the power it gives me.  She looks, I smile and wave as if to say:    Sue:    Fuck you and the platypussies you stumbled in on.       Me:    This, of course, makes no sense to me - why I would have so much contempt and describe it in this way because a detest the P-word.  Just as I hate Yoda, that little, perverted, ugly, pointy-eared green man who gave me nightmares as a child.  The one who continues to haunt my nights; friend to the bed gnomes who invade my sheets and my mouth while I slumber.    I wish I had more to drink.  I could go up to the counter and scam something.  I'd say, "Hey, I'm with the band."  After all, I am 1 part male.  Aw Jackets.    Julia:    Ru-ru-rah!  ZTA!  Oh, uh...wait.  That's a different time and story.  That does not need discussion.  For this would then be the story that never ended.  "This is the song that never ends."  Buh'bye I love you.  The End.

       Slow down your mind at bedtime     Many people find it hard to "turn off their mind" at bedtime. If this happens to you, gently remind yourself that you can think about these things tomorrow. Then set the thoughts aside. You may have to try this several times before your mind quiets down.  Setting up a special time early in the evening to worry and think may keep you from doing it at bedtime.   Easier said than done.    Scott told me to read a book before bed, but I couldn't even concentrate on that.  Showering didn't help either.  Maybe it's because I'm not in a routine yet, and I have no privacy or time to myself.  There is so much happening...so many changes...I haven't had time to digest everything.    And then there are the new things, and the things I miss.

        Galileo’s head was on the block The crime was looking up for truth And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode I try to trace them to my youth  And then you had to bring up reincarnation Over a couple of beers the other night And now I’m serving time for mistakes Made by another in another lifetime  How long till my soul gets it right Can any human being ever reach that kind of light I call on the resting soul of galileo King of night vision, king of insight  And then I think about my fear of motion Which I never could explain Some other fool across the ocean years ago Must have crashed his little airplane  How long till my soul gets it right Can any human being ever reach that kind of light I call on the resting soul of galileo King of night vision, king of insight  I’m not making a joke, you know me I take everything so seriously If we wait for the time till all souls get it right Then at least I know there’ll be no nuclear annihilation In my lifetime I’m still not right  I offer thanks to those before me That’s all I’ve got to say ’cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime Now I have to pay But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration To let the next life off the hook But she’ll say look what I had to overcome from my last life I think I’ll write a book  How long till my soul gets it right Can any human being ever reach the highest light Except for galileo God rest his soul (except for the resting soul of galileo) King of night vision, king of insight  How long (till my soul gets it right) [til we reach the highest light] How long (till my soul gets it right) [til we reach the highest light] How long

      We left here on Tuesday about 10ish.  Oscar meowed and howled the entire 4 hours.  By the time we got to Lollypop Farm I was a wreck.  So we go in there and have to wait, but I am such an idiot!!!!!  This is how the conversation went:  Intake Lady:  What do we have here? Me:  This is Oscar. Lady:  Why are you bringing him in? Me:  He pees.   Lady:  We don't put house-soilers up for adoption. After she asked me a few more questions and looked at my driver's license, I started crying.  It was awful.  I took him back into the holding room but he would not let go of me.  I don't want to talk about that anymore.  It was like Sophie's Choice.  Ugh.  We took our stuff to the storage locker when we got there, had a lovely steak dinner with my parents, and then went to Six Pockets to play darts.  Wednesday we spent all day in the car driving back.  Yesterday was Kevin's birthday, so in between doing birthday stuff, we packed and packed and packed.  This morning my 2 remaining babies are going to the vet for their vaccine boosters and check ups, etc.  Tomorrow my Dad and my brother and driving out again for another load of stuff.  We're almost done!!!!

       Unemployment: Day 2   Friday was my last day of work.  The company's going out of business plans were confirmed last Thursday afternoon, so in a way I was glad to escape the inevitable.  I was sad to leave my co-workers...there was lots of hugging and crying and pizza!  Even Boss hugged me and got a little teary when I left.  I'll miss them.  Sunday was even worse.  My last day at the church.  There was even more crying and hugging, but cake instead of pizza.  The Pastor announced the reception for me before the service started, and she got all choked up!  Amazing!  She and I NEVER got along.  Anyone who has known me in the past 5 years has heard their fair share of my bitching and moaning about how awful she is.  But maybe I touched her life and never even knew it.  That's what my Mom says.  I have learned so much about myself from being at that little church.  In many ways, my faith journey began there.    Anyway, on Sunday the Pastor did something rather surprising.  After she gave the Benediction, everyone sat down while I started the Postlude.  At first I couldn't figure out what was happening.  I thought I had screwed up.  Then I realized they were actually listening to me play!  Usually the congregation is falling over themselves to get out of there, especially when it's a nice day, as it was on Sunday. But they all sat down and listened to me play...and I played my very best.    When I was done, the Pastor asked me to come out in front of the altar and I received a standing ovation.

       Malachite is believed to contain a steady pulsing of electromagnetic energy, which can stimulate physical and psychic vision and concentration. It’s believed to be useful for healing illnesses of the stomach, liver, kidneys, lungs and immune system. It’s said to release and draw out pain and inflammation, depression, anger and heals blockages. Some say it can be used to absorb undesirable energies including radiations produced by television and computer screens. Some use it by placing it in four corners of a room to cleanse the room of toxins and gases. Malachite is also believed to ease electromagnetic energy.  Malachite is said to be a symbol of creativity and is sometimes used to bring fears and desires to a conscious level. Malachite is said to bring harmony into one's life. Some believe it helps the user become more patient.

      Last night,  urlLink Julia ,  urlLink Matt , and I went to hear Beethoven's  Missa Solemnis .   urlLink Read the D&C review here .  While I enjoyed hearing it very much, I have to say that one of the best parts was the free admission.  Actually, not.  I am a huge fan of choral oratorios...the Mozart  Requiem , the Brahms  Eine Deutsche Requiem , the Verdi  Requiem , the Schubert  Mass in G , the Vivaldi  Magnificat , and especially the Lauridsen  Lux Aeterna .  (I could go on for HOURS!)  I guess now I'm just happy to have music back in my life as regularly as it is...not being an active participant for 2 months while unemployed really created a longing I hadn't acknowledged until I started playing again.    Anyway, it was a good concert...the orchestra was in fine form, save a few shaky entrances and some tuning issues.  Oh, and the company wasn't too bad either.  *winks*

The convenience of every shopping place to which one would need to travel being no more than 10 minutes away 9.  Cheap(er) gas 10.  My in-laws  JUST KIDDING!

       A semi-eventful weekend......   Friday we had dinner at Keenan's where I ran into my 7th grade English teacher.  Normally, one might be happy to run into old teachers.  I, however, loathe running into people I know (unless they are people with whom I've been friends with for years, or people with whom I have a close relationship).  Actually I find it rather embarrassing.   Anyway, Saturday was a day of cooking.  I spent hours at Wegman's (one of the things I deeply missed about Rochester).  Saturday afternoon/evening I spent hours cooking after spending hours shopping.  I made  urlLink TURKEY ROULADES WITH DRIED APRICOT ROSEMARY STUFFING AND APRICOT MUSTARD SAUCE , Steamed Lemon Butter Asparagus, and a lovely Tossed Green Salad.

On top of all the ridiculous bullshit happening, at one point I was down in the kitchen getting something out of the fridge when I sneezed, and as my head came down, BAM!  I smacked it right into the corner of the doorframe.  Hard.  So now, the door frame is dented (yes, actually dented), my head has a goose egg the size of Jacob's Field, and there's been a shooting pain down the right side of my neck ever since.

      I went to a performance of  Swan Lake  once, during my freshman year in college.  It was a performance given by the now defunct Cleveland-San Jose Ballet, whose conductor was also the conductor of our college orchestra.  I went with Frankie and "white" Linda, and we got a ride from the conductor, who drive his little red BMW up I-71 like the world was ending.   After the performance, we went backstage to greet the dancers and musicians.  On the way out to the parking lot with the conductor, Frankie and Linda and I turned around to shake hands with Mr. Tony Randall, who had been at that evening's performance.   Cheers to Tony Randall, who died Monday evening, for giving me my best celebrity story.  So far.

      Whew.  What a fabulous weekend.    Saturday evening involved helping Ryan and Kirk clean their apartment and move stuff.  At one point, Kirk suggested we stop for a short break and run across the street to  urlLink Mex  for  a  margarita.  One turned into 4 each.  Needless to say, nothing was accomplished after that.  urlLink    The 4-Margarita Focus Group (Ryan and Kirk and the yummy margaritas.)   Later Saturday night, courtesy of Ben, we were able to see the   urlLink Dave Matthews Band Laser Light Show at the Planetarium .  Julia participated in the Focus Group, while Ryan and I frantically searched for his missing car keys, which turned out to be at the bottom of my bag.  Julia, ever on my wavelength, suggested the only thing I would have, had I taken part in said Focus Group: screw DMB, what about Tori?  Ben then gave us a tour of the catwalks inside the dome.  urlLink    Behind the scenes.  Home to bed without any beer....:-(

      Just like Grandma used to make it.  It's the least I could do in return for Julia's gracious hospitality.   1 Quart Strawberries 1 Cup Sugar    Hull and slice strawberries.  Mix them with the sugar in a bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour.    2 Cups Flour 2 TBSP. Sugar 3 tsp. Baking Powder 1 tsp. Salt 1/3 Cup Butter 1 Cup Milk Extra butter and real whipped cream    Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Grease round layer cake pan (8x1").  Stir together the flour, 2 TBSP. sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Cut in the butter.  Stir in the milk until just blended.  Spread dough in pan and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.  Let cool.  When cool, split the biscuit in half horizontally and spread with butter or margarine.  Cut into portions, and spoon the berries into the center and on top.  Top with real whipped cream.     urlLink    The way real men whip cream!  (Matt)  Go to Strawberry Heaven!    urlLink    the Shortcake   urlLink    Mmmm!  Julia wolfing down the shortcake.  It was gone in roughly 30 seconds.   urlLink    Julia and me - post food-gasm.

      It was a comedy of errors last night.  After spending all afternoon running around, I ended up being slightly late for my gig in Farmington.  HOWEVER, as luck would have it, five minutes before I was supposed to play, the entire town lost power.  Hah!  So there were no keys.  Instead, I banged on the bongos a little, did a little Keith Partridge-action on the tambourine, and sang my heart out.    We finally got on the road last night at close to 10pm, to head to Jamestown.  I am now there.  I had quite the leisurely morning - sleeping till 10am, having a cuppa English Breakfast, perusing Julia's Real Simple magazines, then having a fabulous shower.  Mmmm.  Wonder if she'll let me move in.

       urlLink    Lauren  For all you ice cream aficionados out there...today's  urlLink Democrat & Chronicle  features area ice cream venues around town.  Sadly, the story is not available on-line, so I scanned the photo they showed.  It's Lauren, my good friend!  Even though ICW didn't get a dazzling review, there's something to be said for free ice cream when friends and family work for the place.  Heh.  I get free ice cream.  *sticks out tongue*

      Yesterday afternoon, my Mom and I attended  urlLink Julia 's Bridal Shower/Tea.  I'm sure Julia will post a full account herself, however I do want to state for the record, that I had a lovely time.  The ladies looked fabulous, dressed from head to toe in pastels (notice the black Anne and I are wearing), hats, and even some white gloves.   urlLink     urlLink    The Bridal Party - Anne, Julia the Bride, and me.&nbsp;  By far, however, the most enjoyable part of the afternoon was watching Julia open her gifts.  Julia loves presents.  I didn't shoot any photos of that because Anne and I were swamped with the traditional Bridesmaids' duties.  Anne took copious notes on the gifts, their givers, and the comments Julia exclaimed while opening them ("When you pick it up, it opens!").  Meanwhile, I created a stunning bouquet from the ribbons and bows Julia gingerly pulled off each package, despite our raucous chanting, "break it, break it!".  I think it's stupid, but supposedly the Bride will have the same number of children as the number of ribbons she breaks while opening shower gifts.   &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Anne, Holly, and Julia enjoying cucumber sandwiches sans the crusts, scones, and a lovely selection of teas.   Also, kudos to Julia's Mom for not making us play any of those ridiculous bridal shower games, i.e. make a wedding dress for the bride out of toilet paper.

      There was an article a few days ago in the  urlLink D&C  about personality types based on the sort of music one enjoys.  So I took the test, and here are my results:  urlLink My Music Personality   I scored high in the following categories:  Reflective & Complex  -  People with high scores on the reflective and complex music-preference dimension tend to be open to new experiences, creative, intellectual, and enjoy trying new things.    Edgy & Aggressive  -  People with high scores on the energetic and aggressive music-preference dimension tend to enjoy taking risks and engaging in thrilling experiences. They also tend to be dominant, imaginative, and energetic.   (This last one amuses me. I wonder where Tori falls??)  To take the test yourself  urlLink here .

      For a brief account of my weekend, visit  urlLink Julia's  post, since she and I were pretty much together for the majority of Saturday and Sunday.     Friday:  What did I do on Friday?  I can't even remember!   Saturday:  I didn't enjoy the  urlLink October Project  show as much as Julia.  So what?  It just wasn't the same without the warm, smoky voice of  urlLink Mary Fahl .  However, despite the at times ear-splitting feedback debacle, there were some moments when, musically, OP's planets were aligned.  After the show we headed to O'Loughlin's where I was forced to perform some heavy-duty eye-rolling toward my hockey-fan companions.      Sunday:  I worked in the morning, then headed over to Julia's to help assemble bridal shower favors.  Sunday night, I attended my first "hockey" game.  If you could call it that.  Rollerhockey.  I felt like I was in a Corey Haim/Corey Feldman movie.  Too bad the team we were rooting for lost.  Ah, well.  Beer makes the agony of defeat feel pretty damn good:   &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Ben and Ryan drowning their sorrows and numbing their injuries.

      Last night I watched  urlLink John Kerry  give his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.  I can't recall a time when I was more impassioned about an election. Well, except for the Democratic Primaries. I am excited but also terrified by what could happen this November, which is something I think a lot of Americans are also feeling. This sentiment was echoed in the analysis ( urlLink Larry King Live ) I watched on  urlLink CNN , following Kerry's encouraging speech. There were several interesting commentators discussing the speech with King, including John Cusack (LOVE him),  urlLink the poster boy for the young Republicans  who I wish to punch in the face, and  urlLink an eloquent young man from MTV News  with whom I think I am now in love.  urlLink    Gideon Yago  Also, visit the  urlLink Official Kerry-Edwards Blog .

       urlLink    Do NOT go to  urlLink Flour City .&nbsp; We went last night, and in a word, AWFUL!&nbsp; There was hardly anyone there, on a Saturday night, which right away gave me an uneasy feeling.&nbsp; So what if they just opened at the beginning of May?&nbsp; That's no reason for us to&nbsp;sit there a good 10 minutes&nbsp;after ordering our beer!&nbsp; What was the&nbsp;server waiting for?&nbsp; An engraved invitation?&nbsp;  &nbsp; And the food...!&nbsp; I ordered the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad.&nbsp; The chicken wasn't grilled (it appeared to have been boiled - limp, tasteless, and room temp), nor was the salad "Caesar" (no fresh grated Parmesan, limp greens, and dressing that wasn't really Caesar).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atleast the beer was semi-adequate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll never go there again, and don't you, either!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The only redeeming part of the evening was the company, and following things up with a pint of  urlLink Guinness  at Shamrock Jack's afterward.&nbsp; We should have just gone there to eat.

      Perhaps I am spreading myself too thin.&nbsp; &nbsp; I keep two journals...one under my bed that has been the undoing of many relationships, and one I carry in my bag with me everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately I have been neglecting both, which loosely means, really, that I have been neglecting myself.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; Or, still?&nbsp; I write of what I think I know, but actually it is more of what&nbsp;I do not know.&nbsp; I feel uninspired, stressed, used up.&nbsp; I said I was going to do so much and have accomplished so little in the past&nbsp;four months.&nbsp; Big plans deflate easily with muse and distraction.&nbsp; How much of that is circumstance and how much is free will? &nbsp;  There were always in me, two women at least, one woman desperate and bewildered, who felt she was drowning and another who would leap into a scene, as upon a stage, conceal her true emotions because they were weaknesses, helplessness, despair, and present to the world only a smile, an eagerness, curiosity, enthusiasm, interest. &nbsp; -Anais Nin

      First, before I post, *EXPLETIVE DELETED*.  I had another post but it is now lost.&nbsp; Balls.&nbsp; Hopefully I can remember what it was I had written.....*thinks*  Nope.&nbsp;  Anyway, the bulk of my time in the last week or so has been spent on wedding preparations.&nbsp; I depart for Buffalo in exactly one week.&nbsp; What I have been doing (mostly wedding-related):  &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Picked up the bridesmaid dress and obsessed over the fact that it does not fit quite right.&nbsp; Scrambling now to have alterations completed in time so that I will not be forced to skip down the aisle in merely my unmentionables and my ultra-cute, a-la-Audrey-Hepburn kitten heels.  &nbsp;  2.&nbsp; Driven all over town looking for an appropriate wedding gift.&nbsp; Found one...custom...will be ready for pick up on Thursday.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  3.&nbsp; Consumed copious amounts of beer that have resulted in the participation in some very interesting conversations, including the following:  &nbsp;&nbsp; TJ:&nbsp;&nbsp; (something about the matching orange, "crabby" pants we both happened to be wearing at the same time)  &nbsp;  Me: &nbsp; Take&nbsp;my pants off! &nbsp;    &nbsp;   (roaring fits of laughter)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   .....and &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Brett: &nbsp; I masturbate a lot...I wore out a porno DVD.  &nbsp;  Random Guy in Bar: &nbsp; Which one?!?!?  &nbsp;  4.&nbsp; Experiencing mad food cravings, including ice cream, cheeseburgers, french fries, pizza with mushrooms (actually consumed), egg salad,&nbsp;corn on the cob, Caesar salad with grilled salmon, and lobster.&nbsp; Ooh my stomach wants to be fed!!  &nbsp;  5.&nbsp; Racked my brain for wedding toast topics.&nbsp; How does one adequately embarrass the bride and groom without pissing off their parents?&nbsp; They all know where I live.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, if I'm getting this nervous already about a wedding which isn't even mine, I can't imagine how  urlLink the Bride  is feeling.&nbsp; A week from tomorrow.....!&nbsp;

      A short account of the very liquid-y weekend, had by all...   Friday:   Many, many pitchers at MacGregor's, Lenny Kravitz played on the jukebox just for me, some scheming that was not so obvious (or was it?!?!  TJ?), LOUD exclamations about relations, Julia missing her fries with the salt shaker and hitting the plate several times in a row instead, finger-wagging, lots of ass-grabbing (friends' asses and strangers' asses), and all around way too much fun.  See   urlLink Ryan's post  for full details.  urlLink    TJ trying to defeat Amazon Woman at pool.  urlLink    Sean and Beth    Saturday:   Oooh, the Mad Tea Party was a great success!    urlLink       urlLink    the fabulous 'mad' favors   urlLink    Julia:  "OH!  They look phallic!"

      I felt a little questionable last night, so we drove all over town looking for a relatively uncrowded bar.  We found ourselves at O'Loughlin's around 9:30ish and discovered the Fast Ferry was about to come in and dock:      urlLink    The Fast Ferry  The photos are slightly blurry due to the motion of the boat- that thing is faster than a minnow can swim a dipper.  It pulled into the channel, whipped around, and docked in probably under 2 minutes, if that.  It was pretty incredible to watch.  urlLink      Afterwards, more wandering, and ending up at Dick & Mare's.     Note to self:   Do  NOT  tell anyone else about how I hocked a major lung oyster on the car plastered with "W in '04" stickers, parked next to me at Kitchen's Etc.

       4 July  Rain, rain, and more rain...got utterly drenched on the High Falls bridge while craning our necks to see the fireworks.  Afterwards, we warmed ourselves at Bru with brew.   6 July  Anne and I spent most of the day running around, finalizing the preparations for the Mad Tea Party on Saturday.  It was a day of aggravation, helplessness, and car rides from Spencerport to Henrietta, to Penfield, to Victor, and back to Spencerport.  With only time for about 1 margarita in between.  Oh balls.  As if the day couldn't have been worse, on the way back to Spencerport so Anne could pick up her car, we got stuck in a major traffic jam:  urlLink    Route 531, 5:15pm on Tuesday  We sat in the car, not moving, for almost an hour.  Perfect.   7 July  The best day of the week so far was yesterday.  Gretchen and I got in the car around 9:30am and headed toward Jamestown.  We stopped in Westfield to have lunch at the Main Street Diner.  Not realizing that we weren't yet in Mayville, we headed to the library.  This proved to be quite fortuitous, because we collected so much information for our research on the towns of Ellington and Poland, that we didn't even find it necessary to go to Mayville.  Once we figured out we weren't there yet.  We wrapped things up around 3-ish and headed to Jamestown for a short visit with     urlLink Julia  and  urlLink Matt .  This is why I love my best friend: Julia - Hey!  Want something to drink? Me - Yeah, do you have any beer? Julia - Um, we have Moosehead and Blue Light Me - Can we go to the brewery? Julia - Sure!    So, we got back in the car and drove to  urlLink Southern Tier .  For the second time in the last month.  HOWEVER, I'm smoking mad because as soon as we pulled in the parking lot, they locked the goddamn doors!  NO!!!!!!!!!!!  Julia pulled incessantly on the door handles, in disbelief, but to no avail.  So we went to Weggie's and got 2 12-packs instead.     We had pizza at Pace's, and Gretchen and I were on the road to come home by 8.    And, to top off the evening, I knocked a bottle of the Mild on to the floor once we got home.  It smashed.  Oh balls.

      The other night I had my first Abbott's of the season.  Even though I was kind of in an iffy mood that night, I was somewhat comforted by the familiarity of Beach Avenue.  The two months before and after I moved back to Rochester sucked all my energy out.  My attitude needed a major adjustment - it took a while for me to stop looking at myself as a victim of circumstance.     you're just an empty cage, girl, if you kill the bird    I've danced with my demons, and now I'm laying them to rest.

      Yesterday was one of those days I should have never gotten out of bed.  I burned my left index finger on the stove while checking to see if the back pilot light had gone out in addition to the front one. It hadn't. Later, I managed to melt an entire tube of chapstick all over a load of laundry in the dryer. And finally, last night while at Ben and Susan's, I tried my hand (hah!) at "knife-catching" when Susan dumped the knife block off the counter. Not to mention the three or four times I bumped my head on the 1. refrigerator door, 2. the car door, 3. the dryer door, and 4. the shower stall door.  Not five minutes after we walked in the door last night, I was bleeding. The glass of wine Ben brought me while I was bandaging myself helped to somewhat assuage the disgust I felt as a result of my clumsiness.  Once the drinking commenced, however, I forgot all about the pain. At least I can still type now. Haven't tried playing piano yet. Let's hope I'm functional in that arena still, too. If not, what would I say to the church congregation tomorrow morning when I'm fumbling around on the organ? Luckily the pastor is on vacation so I'll have minimal explaining to do. Sheesh.  urlLink    Why am I smiling??? That's Susan trying to help me re-enact my knife-catching stint. Note my bowling fingers which are bandaged. Appropriate for our viewing of The Big Lebowski. And I hadn't had anything to drink yet at this point, but a few sips of wine. I'm such a mess.

      I had a whopping 10 inches cut off this morning so I could donate my hair to  urlLink Locks of Love .  urlLink    Here's the proof!  Soon as someone takes a photo of my head, I'll post that, since I'm terrible at photographing myself.

      It begins...  Tomorrow I go in at 11am for my chopping.  Gretchen's appointment was changed to tomorrow, also.  Mom will probably go into cardiac arrest before the day will be over, due to sensory overload.  urlLink    Harley before we went to the groomer.
