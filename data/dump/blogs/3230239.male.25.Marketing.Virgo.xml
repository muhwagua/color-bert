       it is really tough to maintain a blog. Atleast that's what i feel. I started this blog a month back, first cpl of days i religiously blogged then it became once a week.   Welll after a long gap i logged back to Blogger. Last few weeks have been really hectic. I was not in station for few days too. Had gone to bombay to attend my cousins wedding. I have always been fascinated about the place bombay.So i was eager to go there for the wedding. I remeber the last time i went there for my other cousins wedding, i had a blast out there. All our cousins there hmm that was one gr8 trip. Anyways this time things were different. I just went for the wedding & came back. HAd good food met up with all my other relatives & that was it. :) I have to go back to the city just to meet up some friends. wonder when i will ge time.  Got back to bangalore from the scorching heat of bombay. It felt great to be back home. was at home for a day & then i was off to kerala for another cousins wedding. In one week i had travelled from one end of india to another. I was dead tired by the time i got back from all those visits.  The whole travel business started on the 12th of may & ended on 20th of may, one week & one day of travelling.   Got back & found that we have relatives at home. My friend call my house a lodge. Right through the year we have one extra person at our house. It would be either a relative from dad's or mom's side or friends . its fun to have ppl at home but at the same time it could get a little mad out there. finally all have left & its just back to us at the house, plus my granny :)  well i tried to put everything what i had in mind into this, will log of for today. hopefully will blog sometime soon. cya

       One of my favourite movies is  urlLink Terminator . Everything in the movie was totally awesome. I had always wondered if such things could ever come true. At that age, the whole thing was a total piece of fiction & it would remain like that... but will it??  I was just reading an article on  urlLink Wired .  A year ago, neuroscientist Mitsuo Kawato called on the Japanese government to commit 50 billion yen ($446 million) a year for the next three decades. The dream: an  urlLink Apollo -like program to build a robot with the mental, physical, and emotional capabilities of a 5-year-old child. Kawato called his plan the Atom Project, named for the popular postwar cartoon Tetsuwan Atom (known as Astroboy in the US), the story of a superhero boy robot.    Two blogs, first about a 5 year old kid with super strength & now this. Man whats next in line??????

       I did know what the word  urlLink patent  meant,  but never knew until I started working, what this patent stuff meant for the corporate world.  Anyways the whole thing about writing this two lines on patent was to tell about the new patent that  urlLink MicroSoft  has got....  "Microsoft has been given a patent for using human skin as a power conduit and data bus"    urlLink Microsoft patents skin of world+dog     man now our body is going to be used for transmitting power!!phew... the article goes on to report..  The big idea is that the physical resistance offered by the human  body could be used to create a virtual keyboard on a patch of skin .  Now like that was all that I needed..  I wonder where this will all lead too. Anways... more later  oh there is something called  urlLink software patent  also. So now i will also try to get something patented ... :) now that will be something  cheers to that.

       Was reading the blog on music by my friend  urlLink rahul , so i thought i will also write somethig about my love for music.  To start with during school days I just listened to hindi movie songs. Man I used to burn up my dad's money buying all the latest tapes of those days.When I think about the buying spree i sit & smile now.If only i had saved up that money, i would have been rich :) anyways dont regret anything. Apart from that i used to love listening to "old" hindi music &  urlLink country music . My mom's side folks used to listen to it so i fell in love with it too.  urlLink Kenny Rogers ,  urlLink John Denver ,  urlLink Randy Travis  were my favourites, many more there but honestly dont remember the names.   Speaking of country music, i was watching the news last night where i heard about this guy  urlLink Bobby Cash . According to the news he is the first Indian country singer. There was a small clipping of him too.. you bet he can sing well too.  Anyways, that was at school.. Fwwwd enter college & I met up with my new friends & my god they chaned me. I had friends who were intrested in rock music, classic rock & more hard rock :) that was the introduction for me. My best friend in my class vijay was a die hard fan of  urlLink pink floyd , Manoj well he could kill anyone for saying  urlLink Metallica  is bad :), Santosh ( sandy to us) loved  urlLink scorpions , Arjun the  urlLink Iron Maiden  guy & to complete the list was Julius now he loved all the above groups but his favourite was  urlLink The Beatles . So as you can see I got introduced to as most people called the real kinda music. I totally loved it. Well there were just 3 of us who were not intrested in these type of music till college.. to start with  urlLink me ,  urlLink ansari  (my other best friend from college) & sajith ( who is somewhere in UK working his  urlLink arse  out ).  Things def. turned once we met up at college. I am sure my friend will agree with me that those were the best days of our life.  Now I listen to all kind of stuff, being in  urlLink Bangalore  I meet up with lot of people & almost all of them are into rock. When anyone thinks of Bangalore the first thing that comes to anyone's mind is a  urlLink pub  and this city has plenty of  urlLink them . So come weekend its time for  urlLink pub crawl .  Hmm.. thats about it. In short i just love listening to  music   Rock on.....

       What publishers can do to sell their books??  Just few days back i read this article on  urlLink Reuters  about  urlLink Penguin Publishers  using sexy  urlLink models  to increase the sales of their book. And today i read about how the  urlLink NewYork Magazine  has a pic of a nude woman in the cover.  Looks like either the publishers are not getting good stories to print or they found that this is the best way to sell their products.....

       Its almost 5 in the eve, plan to go home early. As u can c i dint blog much today, although i did come across few articles that i thought was intresting to blog.  Well anyways, its been a kinda dull day. Had conversation with my friend Rahul (btw he has his own  urlLink blog  now) regarding email & the free spaces they are giving. The way these companies are competing with each other on spaces is really funny. It all started with the famous  urlLink Gmail . Now  urlLink yahoo  is come with  urlLink 100 MB  free space. Wonder what next.  I am pretty sure that when this email service first started , the creators dint think that the space they give is going to be such a problem later on. I dont know y  i wanted all that extra space for my mail. I guess this is what all the advertising & media write up does to all. Make you want something that may not have any extra benefit to you.  well anyways, that was that. its end of the day. time to put all thinking to a stop, go home & just relax.  will do some more blogging tomorrow.  cya

       Its the end of the week. Looking back this week has been pretty ok.Had its shares of ups & downs. Monday was not a very good one, was kinda lost with my thoughts about what to do next in life, so was kind of low the whole day. But things changed by wednesday,work was going on fine, things were falling into place & by thursday i was back to being myself.  On top of that on thursday i got  urlLink Gmail  well i was damn thrilled. I know its a pretty silly think to get excited about. But then when the whole world is talking about this mail service which as of now is by invite only & u happen to be one to have it, well for me it was time to gloat :)). Anyways that was that.  Looks like this blogging is getting addictive, i have been blogging almost everything i like now. And now i got my colleague  urlLink Rishi  to start his blog aslo... hmm, haaa friday went for  urlLink Hum Tum  contrary to what others said, I for one loved the movie.  I love movies,saw  urlLink Harry Potter  & prisoner Azkaban last friday. It was a good movie, but loved the book better. well in a jist that was what happened with me right from friday last. I just hope i have a good weekend & start the week better than i did this week.  well more later....

       Work...... man it can get really tough at times. There were days during school days that i wished i had fiished studying & started a job so that i dint have to worry about anything. Man how wrong was i. Worlds getting too competitve. Its at work more than at school that u have to be sharp & keep upgrading whatever is that u know. I am working for a software firm. Na i am def not a programmet/code writer etc, but i am into the art of selling all those wonderful products these lovely code writers bring about.  I have been in this industry for almost 4 years now, & in this 4 years i have changed my role quite a no: of times. Now i am into Business Development (BD).Right from  day 1 i have always felt that i will be good at this. Now that i am doing what i feel is the best thing for me is getting to be tough. BD as the word suggests is to develop business for the company. I just wish it was as easy as it was to say the designation. For the last 4 months that i have been doing this role, i have just found myself trying to figure out newer newer ways to talk to clients. these are the steps i follow. 1) first try to identify the market i am trying to look at 2) in this market try to figure out who the companies would be to target  3) now after that is done, whom to target within these companies 4) try to get the contact details of these people 5) now draft a mail telling about what our company does & mail it to them 6) wait for a couple of days & then follow it up with a call to these guys.  well these steps are easy to put down, but when it comes to reality, chances of getting the right person & getting to talk to them is difficult. Now if we do get the person & do manage to talk to them, convincing them without meeting them is harder. hmmm  If anyone does read what i have written, do let me know if i am missing any step? Do u ppl also feel that trying to talk to a person without putting a face to the person name is tough. Love to hear ur comments  take care nitin

       Its been few days since I blogged, the reason well a mix of no news plus no time, anyways here I am writing my latest blog.  &nbsp;  My last  urlLink blog &nbsp;was on Mobile fones &amp; how the real use of a mobile fone has taken a back seat &amp; more &amp; more use is being found out.  &nbsp;  Read this article in today's  urlLink Economic times -  Dump your wallet, your  urlLink cell 'll do the job, this is done by the Japanese people.We all know how fast they move with technology, so I guess the day is not far&nbsp;when U &amp; I will be totally depended on the mobile for every single thing.  Maybe the song    urlLink You have the whole world in your hands    was coined with the mobile use in mind :)  --------  Now with more &amp; more use of the mobile fones, we probably cant say that I forgot to take my mobile, so someone def had to think of a way to overcome that situation of not answering your calls :)  My friend  urlLink Ansari  read this article in  urlLink New Scientist  which tells us&nbsp;exactly how that can be done......  &nbsp;     urlLink Cell phone software creates bogus backgrounds     -----  Pretending to be stuck in traffic during a mobile phone call could become much easier using software that generates fake background noise  ------  &nbsp;  well that's all for the moment, but I am sure there will be many more blogs on mobiles sooner or later..  &nbsp;  have fun...  &nbsp;  ps: I love my  urlLink nokia &nbsp;mobile( urlLink nokia 6600 ), I doubt I go anywhere without it.

       Among the other ways to advertise your products, having a huge billboard at some strategic places does the trick.  This  urlLink billboard  did catch everyones attentions :) they sure got the attention, but the outcome i guess was not liked by the people who viewed it.

       I guess there is an unwritten law that if any company brings anything new to the market, there will be someone out there to increase the competition.   urlLink Apple Inc . introduced  urlLink ipod  and now we have  urlLink sony  with their brand new  urlLink 20 GB walkman
