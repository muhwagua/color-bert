      Why am I awake?  Since going to England in November, I've been all screwed up.  First, I did something unkind to my back (I think it was hauling the several obscenely heavy suitcases full of books for the Green Ronin convention exhibit all across London on the Underground).  While I was limping around and falling asleep stupidly early, my beloved was suffering the opposite jet lag and was unable to come to bed until I was on the rise.  I joked that we were like those sheep dogs in the cartoon that greet each other "Hello George," as they're crossing paths to punch in/out for work.  No sooner had we righted our schedules than I fell ill and was ill for much of the month of December. I spent much of my so-called holiday feverish and coughing and tossing in sweaty, hallucinatory sleep.  I finally started feeling recovered, well into the month of January, and somewhere along the line I ended up on a bizarro-world schedule that still plagues me.  I wake at 7:45 in order to get my girl dressed, fed, combed, and off to school on the bus.  Some mornings we cut it too close and she doesn't make it to the bus stop in time, so I bundle up, pull a hat down over my head and drive her.  By the time all this ruckus is over, I'm awake again for 3 or 4 hours, and then fatigue sets in and I'm falling asleep on my keyboard, so I have a snooze and try to recover my energy.  After my nap time, I'm ready to "get started" on my day, finally eating a meal when most people are considering what they're going to have for supper.  By the time Kate is getting ready for bed, I'm worn out again and often fall asleep in the middle of reading her bedtime story.  Unfortunately, I'm never down for the night, and inevitably I'm awake again an hour or two before midnight.  Wide awake.  This simply can't go on, but I've been too weak to force myself to struggle through the day in order to collapse *once* at a reasonable hour of the night.  Because I'm the only driver in the household, I need to be fresh and clear-headed at the right times in order to make the obligatory treks to the post offices, the bank, the grocery store, and any other errands or chauffeuring of the child/husband that need doing.  There are several potential solutions to this situation, I suppose we'll see how it all resolves itself eventually.

      Razza Frazza  Technology has kept me from being able to post updates the last couple of days.  For people who have known me since the computer age began, this will be no surprise.  Technology hates me.  Computers are magical things that work one day and cease working the next, usually going on strike after I've gone to bed for the night and with no sign of what I've done to offend them.  "Computer people" routinely say things like "Huh, that's weird," while puzzling over whatever my issue du jour might be. I'm currently in a state where the planets have aligned, offerings made, karma is good, and all the computers in the house are actually working *and* able to connect to each other.  Hoorah.  I figure I'll ride it out for as long as the current cycle holds, but it's only fair to assume that in the next phaze of the moon it could all go straight to hell again.  Have decided to host a cocktail party this weekend.  I've assembled an impressive list of potential cocktails and hors d'oeuvres aplenty.  I'm assembling a bossa nova soundtrack and I actually went out and bought a punch bowl.  Must find a source of inexpensive swizzle sticks and little paper umbrellas before Saturday!

      Food, Part II  Back in high school I started collecting recipes.  I still have little grey-brown card file with recipes hand-written on index cards, or clipped from magazines and taped to cards, that I started when I was about 16.  That little box alone has about 300 recipes crammed into it, for simple marinades and typical Midwestern hot dish recipes, and for things that seemed downright exotic to me then (using ingredients like mango or eggplant or tofu, things not typically found at Petrika's Red Owl in the 1980s).  Since those days I have accumulated quite the collection of cookbooks and cooking magazines. I have four solid shelves of cookbooks, for foods of all kinds.  French, Italian, Greek, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Southwestern, Asian-fusion, books dedicated to baked goods, several books exclusively on cookies, bread-baking books for bread machines and for breads made by hand.  There are the books that proclaim they will teach you Essentials of Cooking, A New Way to Cook, How to Cook Everything, or How to Cook Without a Book.  I have by the numbers books; 50 Chowders, 365-one-dish Meals, and so on.  Their titles promise to share with me the Joy of cooking, the Easy Basics, Timesaving tips, Creative, Complete, Essential, and the Best of food from around the world.  Pasta sauces, cooking with fresh herbs, vegetarian cookbooks (often with titles like "The Festive Vegetarian" or "Voluptuous Vegan" as if to reassure the reader that the bounty of vegetarian entrees will not be ignoble and flat, limited to sprouts and nut loaves), cookbooks from celebrity chefs, cookbooks that champion healthy eating in its many guises, books about whiskey, wine, espresso, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres...  I could find something new to cook for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and not repeat myself for years.  It seems sinful to collect all these recipes and never make them, so I cook a lot and cook a lot of different things.  I definitely have my favorites, but my passion for the last three years has been, hands down, Cooking Light Magazine.  I have learned that I can pick up an issue of this magazine and trust that I can make virtually anything in it with winning results.  Cooking Light cuts across every book I have on my shelf and presents recipes in a healthful-yet-delicious way that no other publication has been able to do for me.  Of course, it helps that I'm an omnivore and open to try just about anything but the magazine is solid nonetheless.  I routinely cook from the magazine for the family, for special get-togethers, and especially for "game night" when I cook to feed our friends who come over once a week for food and fun.  I consistently get rave reviews for my Cooking Light meals on game night, so I know it's not just that I'm a sucker for food and easily impressed.  Take, for example, the Jan/Feb 2003 issue, from which I've already made the following:  Chicken with Olives and Lemon: Very Good Posole (Tomatillo, Chicken and Hominy Soup): Excellent [raves at game night] Turkey Philly Sandwiches: Excellent Chicken with Artichokes and Olives: Very Good Banana Pudding: Excellent [what a yummy treat!] Roasted Sweet Potato, Fennel, and Onion Salad: Very Good Chicken and Wild Rice Soup: Excellent [more raves at game night for this one] Mini Meat Loaves: Very Good [even Kate ate these, yay!] All-American Chili: Excellent  Still on my list to try from this issue: Barley Pilaf with Chickpeas and Artichoke Hearts Edamame Succotash with Shrimp Pan-Seared Scallops on Linguine with Tomato-Cream Sauce Turkey Tetrazzini   Last night's dinner was garlic shrimp over fettuccine and leftover banana pudding.  Tonight was chili and fresh bread.  Tomorrow I'm taking a break from Cooking Light because I found a beautiful brisket at the store tonight, so it will be brisket, with potatoes and cabbage, and whatever else strikes my fancy.   As the Descendents say, I like food, food tastes good!

      Food, Part I.  I grew up in a house where we never went hungry but we certainly didn't eat well either.  We were poor enough that we ate fruits and vegetables almost exclusively from cans, where milk was never for drinking but only for morning cereal, where a special snack was cinnamon toast or saltines spread with margarine, and dinner might well be creamed tuna or creamed hamburger over toast (which I'm thankful I didn't know the outside the world called "shit on a shingle" or I would never have been able to eat).    I have very few fond food memories from childhood.  The foods I remember most fondly are those from my early years in northern Minnesota: pasties (before I knew calzones or pizza pockets, we had the pastie [PAST' ee]; a crust wrapped around diced carrots, potatoes, onion, and meat), potica [pah TEET za], a paper-thin sweet bread rolled jelly-roll-style around a filling of cinnamon and finely chopped nuts. My father is a sportsman and I loved his smoked fish and the gamy grouse and pheasants.  Those were formative food memories, distant and removed from what I ate most of the rest of my life.  One food I grew to loathe was turkey.  My mom would always cook up a giant turkey for Thanksgiving when she could, but to me the turkey was the worst part.  Potatoes, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, green beans, hot rolls, maybe even real butter and a pumpkin pie with Cool-Whip, oh bliss!  But the turkey?  Dry, coarse, over-cooked and under-seasoned (and that was on the first day, fresh from the oven).  We had turkey leftovers for several days, if not a week.  I still can't say I have fond feelings for turkey.  We were poor enough that a church group brought us a huge box of donated food one Christmas when I was about 13.  My mom wasn't home, and I answered the door.  It was quite a shock to me to find myself standing face to face with a donation box and several youth group members I knew from school.  It was jarring and I felt physically stunned.  Before that time, I knew we didn't have a lot--we didn't have Twinkies or Ruffles or bottles of Coke, we didn't even have generic knock-offs of those things--but I never realized how needy others perceived us to be until that day. I don't remember what was in the box, only that my pre-teen pride was so bruised I swore I wasn't going to eat their charity food, and I ranted to my mother, later, that they should have given that food box to some people who were actually hungry.  Had anyone from the church extended an invitation to dinner, had someone other than my mother cooked that donation box of food and invited us to share it with them, I would have been so much more willing to accept their charity!  I doubt I would have recognized it as charity at all.  The delivery made all the difference, dropping by the house (my house, a house none of those people had ever visited prior) with their charity box made the group feel like good Christians full of holiday spirit, but the change it made in me was quite the opposite of what they intended.  So began my passion for food, not just eating and enjoying it myself but preparing, presenting, and sharing it with everyone I can.

      I was going to have a nice, long, introspective post this morning.  That's what I intended.  Instead, I had to venture out into the wet back yard in my pajamas to help my daughter open the back gate.  The latch has rusted and takes more brute force to open than she's capable of inflicting.  She'd been struggling with it for several minutes before I realized she was still out there and not at the bus stop.  Now my feet are wet and my child has missed her bus and instead of curling up for some coffee and some journal-writing, I'm off to drive her to school.  Work will be demanding my attention by the time I return.  ::sigh::

      I have kept an irregular journal since I was 10 years old. I've used it more as a way to find my voice than as a tool for noting important events; in fact, it has often been the case that my journal contains no entries for important events at all, but plenty of observation of the mundane details of my life.  The creation of this weblog is my attempt to move that paper journal into the modern era.  My attempts at starting this online journal are every bit as clumsy as my first childish entries in my first blank paper journal.  I hope it results in the same degree of personal delight as well.

      Goodbye Mr. Rogers March 20, 1928 - Feb. 27, 2003     "You don't set out to be rich or famous. What you set out to do is to be helpful."  Fred Rogers, gently soft-spoken stalwart of my childhood, died today of stomach cancer. It seems such a hard, cruel way to lose such a gentle man.  If there is anyone who deserved to pass peacefully from this life in a painless slumber, it's Mr. Rogers.    In the 60s and 70s, when what was hot for kids was the frantic muppet capers of Sesame Street or the neon "Hey You Guys!" hysteria of The Electric Company, I'm sure frazzled mothers across the nation really thought they were pulling one over on their kids every time they plunked us down in front of soothing, boring ol' Mr. Rogers.  And perhaps for kids who came from stable, predictable homes Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was something to be mocked, a "baby show".  Not for me.  Mr. Rogers offered something to me, and thousands of children like me, that we didn't have in our own lives.  For half an hour a day, we were basked in gentle, predictable adult attention.  Mr. Rogers was going to walk in the door of his little cottage, put on his sweater and sneakers, and invite us to join him on whatever simple adventure or project he had in mind.  Every time.  For a girl like myself, living in a transient world of new homes, new schools, new friends every year, a child of stressed and harried young parents, this predictability was blissful.  I had no gentleness in my real world.  I was a victim of bullies, ruthlessly teased, awash in grief at my parents' divorce, very little extended family around me.  My parents disciplined through an ever-escalating routine of nagging, yelling, and physical punishments including slaps, hair-pulling, and spankings with hands, belts and spoons. An adult with the attitude of Mister Rogers did not exist in my life.  That's not entirely true.  My father had a friend named Steve, a fishing buddy who we spent a good deal of time with.  Steve and his wife didn't have children then, but they were gentle and patient with my brother and I when we saw them.  Steve goofed around with us in a carefree, unfatigued way.  He talked with us, not at us, not down to us.  But most importantly, when we screwed up, Steve's manner was shockingly different than anything I was used to.  There was a time when we kids were down by the lake, wildly swinging our fishing lines through the air without a thought in the world to the potential dangers of flying fish hooks.  Steve shouted for us to stop, and I (ever the overly sensitive one) burst into tears.  Part of it was from the shock of Steve raising his voice to us, it was so uncharacteristic.  Part of it was from the shock of being reprimanded, since I was too young and inexperienced to make the flying fish-hooks connection for myself; I wasn't trying to be be "bad," I didn't mean to be bad. Mostly my tears came because I desperately feared I'd disappointed Steve, and I'd ruined it for myself, that he'd gotten fed up with me and the days of being treated with patience were done.  What Steve did at that point is something so very simple, but so meaningful to me, I try to remember it as often as I can with my own parenting.  Steve came down to my level, sat close to me and looked me in the eye (or tried, as I sobbed and hid my face in fear and shame).  He made the connection for me, explained that he hadn't yelled because he was angry at me but because he cared about me and saw that I was doing something dangerous.  He cared about me, he didn't want me to get hurt by getting a fish hook in the eye, and we could go on having fun.  That was a Mister Rogers moment.  I couldn't have been more than 6 when I had that exchange with Steve, because my parents were still together then and I was still living in the town where I was born.  Within another year or so, my parents had split up and we moved away not too long after.  While we still occasionally saw Steve and his wife, and later their children, the visits were brief and years apart.  I never forgot that taste of being treated with gentleness and respect and, until I deemed myself "too old" for Mr. Rogers, Fred Rogers kept that memory aglow through his television example.  Bless you, Mr. Rogers,  urlLink for all you've done.   We need more people willing to take their strength from gentleness and set out in the world to be good and helpful.

      Sick  Sure enough, all that travel on buses, trains, planes, and subways (not to mention hauling around in the pouring rain) left me feeling completely ill.  Killer sore throat, pounding headache, the works.  Slept for 10 hours last night, and don't feel any better.  Of course I have tons of work to do.  This is one of those times when I really wish Chris could drive, because it's up to me to drive even when I feel sick.  Kate has drum chorus tonight after school, so I have to go pick her up from that, I have to go to the post office to make sure some folks with missing orders get their replacements before they go nutty, I have to go to the store for food (since I made sure we were out of everything before taking off for our trip).  At least I'm just feeling bad and not feeling like I'm dying, like when I had pneumonia.   I guess my fevered ranting about how awful the American government is behaving is going to have to wait until I can get up a full head of steam.  Just heard that some Canadian friends of ours are so angry and worried about how the US has turned they're considering selling their house here and going back to Canada after something like 10 years of living and working here.  I don't blame them, not one bit.  I feel like packing up and doing the same!  The years I lived in Canada were wonderful, Kate would be closer to her dad, and we could run our business from anywhere.  Back to bed before I depress myself.

      Home  Didn’t make it out to see the Intrepid after all.  It was pouring freezing rain on us the whole last day we spent in NYC, and in walking the short 6 blocks from our hosts’ home to the PATH train we were all soaked through.  I had to wring out my hat in the station, my gloves were soaked, and by the time we made it to Katz’s my coat was soaked through.  Kate was such a trooper, it was all a big adventure to her (a cold, wet adventure, but worth it to her anyway.  I was so proud.) and a nice matzo ball soup was just what the doctor ordered, until we left the deli and found it was pouring rain even harder than when we’d arrived.  Yuck.    Wet and exhausted, we decided the Intrepid would just have to wait.  Kate did insist on buying herself an I [HEART] NY t-shirt and a mini Statue of Liberty.  She loved New York, even at the tender age of 7 and Chris is just so pleased (after I did not fall in love with the city myself: it’s crowded, noisy, filthy; everything I hate and more of it.  I’ve softened on the city a little, but I’m not gaga for it like some people I know).  The trip back to Seattle was amazingly painless.  Quick baggage and security check-in, a not-unpleasant-wait to board, seats all together (you’d be amazed at how often we have trouble with that simple request), arrived perfectly timed to make our  connection in Pittsburgh.  Home sweet home.  Too tired to write any more, but tomorrow I expect I will be refreshed enough to write up some of my thoughts on the current political climate, massive anti-war protests, and atrocities like this:   urlLink link    Rants tomorrow.

      Exhausted  Tried to update the ol' blog when I had a few spare minutes and some web access several days ago, but Blogger's site was funky and I couldn't access Discolor Online.  Kinda ruined my plan of posting updates about the trip.  Oh well.  We're in the last stages of this whirlwind tour and we're all exhausted.  We arrived on the east coast by plane, landing in Providence, RI about midnight on Valentines Day.  Oh, the romance.    Saturday the 15th we drove to the Boston area and spent the day with Chris's folks.  Sunday we drove to Maine to see the waterfront property they'd acquired since our last visit.  Beautiful little place on a scenic Maine bay, windows all around.  I could imagine spending a week there in the summer, supping on lobsters pulled fresh from the water and working on laptops.  Oh, to make it happen!  Monday I was supposed to meet up with the New England members of my mom's group, but an incoming blizzard put a stop to that plan.  I was heartbroken, especially when I learned that the people from New Hampshire drove down to Boston in spite of the storm, with their children!  I had nightmares Monday night about what a horrible person I was to arrange a get together and then not make it.  I spent most of the day feeling depressed and sick, full of anxiety.  One of the women who made the trip with her kids had also traveled to Washington DC specifically for a get together with me on the eve of my wedding... when I was supposed to be in the area and having a "bachelorette party," except that I came down with pneumonia and couldn't make it.  Not only did I not have any sort of pending-wedding celebration of any kind (something that I was really, really disappointed about) but those wonderful ladies spent their precious time (busy moms, all) and money to come to a get-together with me and I left them hanging.  I understand that blizzards and pneumonia are circumstances beyond my control and reasonably legit excuses, but I still feel bad.  Out of proportion bad.  When we dug out from the snow on Tuesday, Kate and I went to a quaint little  urlLink museum of dolls and trains.   Thank goodness it was hands-on and interesting for Kate.  My child was thrilled with the massive snowfall, but needed something else to occupy her that didn't involve getting soaking wet or freezing cold.  Dolls and trains were just the ticket.  Wednesday we finally made it to the Boston Museum of Science.  I'd bought tickets in advance and was worried that they wouldn't honor them since we'd missed our time slot for Monday, but there were no problems.  Unfortunately we'd gotten a late start and so had far too little time at the museum for me.  Again, I was sorely disappointed.  Traffic had been awful getting into the city (I'd thought we were taking the subway, but Chris's father insisted on driving us to the spot) and by the time we arranged the tickets, quickly ran off to the Egyptian exhibit (not even stopping to check our coats because the tickets they gave us for entry were for exactly that moment) then came back to the coat check, then stopped to feed the starving child, etc, we had about an hour and a half to visit the general exhibits.  Just not enough time and once again I was bitterly depressed that the few things I'd planned for my own fun and Kate's entertainment were just not going well at all.  Had sushi with a friend of Chris's from high school, and that perked me up a bit.  Fun was had by all, and hot sake never hurts my disposition.  Thursday very early we were dropped at the subway and had to make our way with our bags to the bus station for our New York City leg of the tour.  Arrived in plenty of time, but the bastards at Greyhound announced the bus was full as we got to the front of the boarding line!  Despite having purchased tickets for the 9am bus, we were forced to wait for the 10am bus. Joyous.  Once we reached the outskirts of New York City our bus driver was driving like a maniac, plowing through intersections, laying on his horn, stopping inches from other vehicles.  Right along Central Park we became stuck in traffic for a good long time.  A couple different passengers got the idea to ask if they could just be let off where we were, but no, the driver insisted that wasn't possible.  When traffic began to finally move again, however, the bus driver misjudged how close he was to a truck and ran right into the guy, tearing the side mirror off the bus.  To a chorus of groans, he pulled off to the side to exchange info with the truck driver.  In the process, he left the door to the bus wide open, and it took all of 90 seconds before restless passengers decided to make a run for it.  We grabbed our bags and rushed from the bus like refugees.  Since we were in the vicinity of  urlLink the Museum of Natural History  we treked the 18 blocks or so, checked our coats and bags, and spent the rest of the afternoon roaming the exhibits.  Kate and I paid extra to tour the exhibit of live butterflies.  After dinner at a Spanish place with tasty sangria, we hoofed it to the Path train and out to stay with our friends in Jersey City.  Yesterday Kate's only request was "no more museums!" so we took advantage of the freakishly mild weather and toured the  urlLink Empire State Building .  Kate was quite delighted and has been holding up on tour amazingly well for a 7 year old, but had about reached her limit for walking and standing in lines.  We made a quick stop at the infamous  urlLink Compleat Strategist  where Chris shopped for games for the 9 years he lived in NYC and then shot up to visit with friends at a hip little cafe, where Kate managed to eat about $15 of chocolate mousse and hand-squeezed orange juice and then took a long nap in the booth while the adults chatted and drank espresso and chocolate martinis.  Off to  urlLink Charlie Mom's  for dinner and meeting up with Green Ronin cohorts Brian E. Kirby, Robert J. Toth, "Crazy" Todd Miller, Rob Lawson, and assorted delightful spouses and friends.  Fourteen of us made for a robust party, the food was delightful, and much game industry business was discussed.  Unfortunately Bill Simoni wasn't able to join us, but all the other NYC Freeport pirates were able to come and a great time was had by all.  I'm officially exhausted now, which explains why I've monopolized the Kirby's internet connection for this update.  I can't seem to motivate myself to move from the chair, even though our plan is to pack up and head out before lunch.  We intend to make our traditional stop at  urlLink Katz's Deli  for giant pastrami sandwiches and matzo balls as big as Kate's head, then I hope we can stash our bags in a locker at Port Authority and maybe make it over to the  urlLink Intrepid  to kill time before our bus is scheduled to leave tonight.  Back to Boston after dark, and then tomorrow to Providence to catch our flight back to drizzly, predictable, Seattle.    Here we go!

      So Tired  Procrastination has always been a habit of mine.  A bad habit, of course, but a comfortable habit.  I had meant to be much more prepared for a ten-day trip to the opposite coast with my child, I had imagined packing my bags a day or more in advance, loading carry on bags with toys and games and goodies to keep us all entertained.  I hoped that I would be caught up on the household chores.  I did manage to get Kate's clothes washed, but nothing has been folded or packed.  I have half a bag of books and toys for Kate, but nothing of mine organized.  As of dinnertime tonight, my beloved thought we were leaving tomorrow night instead of tomorrow in the early afternoon.  In fact, to be safe, we should arrive at the airport by 11am.  Hah.  My saving grace was that it was game night tonight, so I cleaned, took out garbage and recycling, and made sure dishes were washed before anyone came over.  We had turkey "philly" sandwiches, coleslaw, pickles, and chips for dinner and ate from paper plates.  Kathryn brought banana bread and cookies, so the valentine cookies I bought will need to go to Massachusetts with us or go stale, but Kathryn's goodies were yummy, the meal was easy and good, and clean-up was a breeze.  The dishwasher hums along, cleaning the last of our mess, and if nothing else the mail has been put on vacation hold.  I'm amazed that I remembered to do that one so far ahead.  Boston should be fun for us.  It's always nice to see my in-laws, they're just wonderful people.  I also have four "mom friends" in the area, like my girlfriends who joined me in San Diego, so we're going to meet up and bring all our kids to the  urlLink Museum of Science  to see their  urlLink Egyptian exhibition  in particular.  I've been to Boston several times now, but have really done no sight-seeing in the city itself, and I'd like to rectify that on this trip.  We've also got a few days in New York to enjoy, though it won't be as enjoyable as prior visits because of the bitter cold they've been experiencing.  Despite being from Minnesota, I'm not a big fan of arctic temps and frigid winters.  This is also the first time we've been back to New York since the World Trade towers fell.  Leave it to me to plan a trip to New York City during a state of heightened concern about terrorist attacks, and on the virtual eve of war.  Ah well, at least the Koreans don't have nukes that will reach that far (as far as we know).  Must get some sleep so I can get up, pack, finish a few last minute things for the business, and get to the airport early enough that we don't have to worry about missing our plane because of intrusive security measures that back things up.  (I will never forget the time we got to the airport to find a two-hour long line to check in and then another two-hour long line to get through security!  We'd gotten up at three a.m. in order to take a six a.m. flight but weren't anywhere near our gate when it was time for the plane to leave, and the next flight we could get seats on was after noon.  Going through all that was bad enough, but going through it all with a tired, bored child was additional torture.  Never again!)

      Duct Tape  So, in the interest of homeland security, we're being told to stock up on bottled water, plastic sheeting, and duct tape.  Duct tape!  Is there nothing it can't fix?  Meanwhile,  urlLink The Onion  brings tears to my cynical eyes:  Saddam Enrages Bush With Full Compliance WASHINGTON, DC—President Bush expressed frustration and anger Monday over a U.N. report stating that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein is now fully complying with weapons inspections. "Enough is enough," a determined Bush told reporters. "We are not fooled by Saddam's devious attempts to sway world opinion by doing everything the U.N. asked him to do. We will not be intimidated into backing down and, if we have any say in the matter, neither will Saddam." Bush added that any further Iraqi attempt to meet the demands of the U.N. or U.S. will be regarded as "an act of war."   I know it's satire, but the best satire usually ends up being roommates with the truth...   Oh, and did everyone notice that the CIA has announced it believes North Korea has the ability to nuke the west coast of the US, should they feel like it?  Shitty news day.

      Fireina  I came home from shopping for Kate-sized winter wear feeling dazed and a bit numb.  Shopping does that to me sometimes. By the time I got home, Kate was home from school and I received an enthusiastic greeting.  I guess she missed me over the weekend!  We happily tried on boots, hats, gloves, socks, and long-johns.  I also thrilled the girl by stopping at a used video game store and picking up several used cartridges for the hand-me-down  urlLink Gameboy pocket  she has.  For the entire time she's had this game, she's had only one cartridge for it, so in anticipation of spending several hours on the road with her (on planes, trains, and buses) I picked up several brand new games for her and it was like Christmas all over again.  I whipped up a quick dinner of ginger-lime chicken breasts, wild rice pilaf, and fresh, steamed green beans and to my amazement, Kate ate what I made!  As much as I like to cook, Kate hates to eat, so this was a banner night. Woohoo!  After dinner we spent an inordinate amount of time  urlLink building our own wrestlers for Mucha Lucha   and ended up with Fireina.  I'm raising a little geek girl, but we had so much fun.

      Get Away  Just returned from a glorious but whirlwind tour of San Diego and I'm feeling both exhausted and refreshed.  This weekend away with girlfriends (and no kids) was just beyond words.  Everyone there was so fantastic, funny, entertaining, oh I just hated to leave!  It was my first time meeting our hostess, Sheryl, in person (after 8 years of knowing her through e-mail correspondence) and she was a fantastic hostess.  She drove us all over town, made several trips to and from the airport, and let six rowdy, uninhibited, riotous women invade her home for the weekend.  Only one of the other attendees was someone I'd never met in person before, and she was also a funny, wonderful woman (which I'd always suspected from e-mail but you can never be sure how people are going to connect in person until you do it).  The other four attendees I'd met before at various other organized get-togethers and felt as comfortable around them as I would feel around anyone I'd known for the better part of a decade.  These women are so much like the sisters I never had, it was like going home.  After predictions that the weather was likely to be cold and rainy, I was pleasantly surprised that it was quite mild and sunny.  The poor Phoenix contingent might not agree, it was on the cold side for them, I gather.  I, on the other hand, reveled in the sunshine, the ocean, the exoticness of the cacti and palm trees everywhere.  Quite a welcome break from moist, chilly Seattle.  We did typical "girl stuff" which is a whole new ball game for me.  Traditionally I've hung out as one of the guys and I'm quite a bite more likely to whip out the power tools and start a home improvement project as I am to curl up under a comforter with chocolates and a novel.  This weekend it was all about eating and drinking (largely Mexican food, margaritas, and chocolate), playing games, shopping and shopping some more, and gossiping, wise-cracking, and laughing until our sides hurt.  I tore through  urlLink The Bone Setter's Daughter  and  urlLink The Bean Trees , both of which I found completely immersive.  I bought  urlLink The Green Mile  because I was sure that The Bean Trees was not going to last me the whole flight home (and I'm not quite ready to start into something as massive as The Poisonwood Bible) but I was tired enough to sleep on the plane (from staying up late with the girls and then going off to stay up even later reading after they'd all turned in for the night) and only finished as we were pulling into the gate in Seattle.  I've never seen The Green Mile movie and I haven't read a Stephen King book in many years (since I borrowed  urlLink The Bachman Books  from my friend Stewart ten years ago, I'd bet) but I figured I'd give it a whirl.  Home for four days and then we're carting Kate off to Boston to see her Yiayia and Papou, with a little side trip to New York City for her "mid-winter break" from school.  Should be interesting to see how Kate handles the snow and cold, as the east has been having quite the cold snap and Boston got 10-inches of snow over the weekend.  Kate's exposure to extremes of temperature has been very limited, though she's much more likely to wilt in the heat than to complain about the cold if our past encounters with the seasons are anything to go by.  Must remember to buy her a decent hat and scarf this week, and probably a pair of decent lined boots as well.

      As it turned out, Kate and I were both feeling a little fatigued and ready to just hang out at home.  Instead of girls night out, we tucked into the king size bed (Kate brought every pillow in the house and half a dozen dolls to join us) and watched re-runs of  urlLink Gargoyles  and ate microwave popcorn.  Then I read Kate the last chapter of  urlLink The Miserable Mill  and the began  urlLink The Austere Academy .  After four books in the series, Kate is now able to accurately translate what baby Sunny shrieks about 90% of the time and is greatly pleased with herself whenever she blurts out "That's because it's Count Olaf in disguise!" only to have me read the next line, "That's because it's Count Olaf in disguise!".  There are adult references in the books that definitely go over her head, but I would rather read a thousand Lemony Snicket books than the pap she brings home from the school library.  Tonight was supposed to be game night, but three of our players have begged off (one for a possible case of kidney stones!) so it looks like gaming is off for this week.  At this rate, we're never going to get through the Freeport adventure Chris is running us through.  It is supposed to be a playtest game, so we're all trying to behave ourselves and not simply slaughter each evil baddie who crosses our righteous path.  [begin game geek rant] We have such a non-standard group, though, I don't know how useful this playtest is going to be.  One of my gripes with 3rd Edition D&D is that the designers have assumed that each group is going to be "optimized" and have a standard array of character classes/spells/whatnot.  Which means when our non-standard array of characters traipse through the Heart of Nightfang Spire without a cleric, it's an awful lot less fun that it was meant to be.  (Did I mention I hate undead?)  Currently, we've got a group made up of a halfling rogue/fighter, a witch, a pirate, and a puny sorcerer, which is fun for us but doesn't give much insight into how the average (presumably "optimized") party is going to handle the same adventure. [end game geek rant]  Tomorrow, I leave for a weekend in San Diego.   I'm attending a get together with five or six friends of mine who are also mothers of seven-year-olds.  The chicks from Phoenix are driving to San Diego, where two of the moms live, and one is coming down from San Francisco.  I love these women, they're all so cool and so inspirational to me as parents.  It's been 8 years that I've known these women now, though I really can't believe it's been so long.  We all met as part of an e-mail support group when we were pregnant (most of us with our first baby) and those of us that stuck with the group have become lasting friends.  I've attended several of these get togethers over the years, once in Michigan, once in Las Vegas, several smaller get togethers with three or four moms at a time in Seattle, San Francisco, and Boston.  Very few times in my life have I said that I'm looking forward to some chick-time (I'm much more of a tom boy with lots of guy friends) but in this case I can hardly wait to get on that plane.  Woohoo, chick time!

      Productivity  I wrote an entry about productivity, how productive I'd been today and how tomorrow is Wednesday, traditionally "girls' night out" for me and Kate.    Then it was all eaten up as my computer froze.  I have an extension conflict somewhere, but I hate the thought of facing the tedious process of finding it.  I hate trying to make up lost writing, it's never the same and it's never as good as what was lost.  Instead of trying to repost it now, I think I'll just retire to bed and try again tomorrow.  Maybe I'll have something more interesting to write about than productivity.  Productivity is good for the soul, but it makes for rather boring reading.  Stuff got done.  Tomorrow, there will be more stuff to do.

      Synchronicity  I used to be fascinated with the timing of seemingly random events, coincidence, synchronicity.  Like when you're thinking of an old friend you haven't heard from in years only to receive a card or a phone call or an e-mail from them, or see their name in the paper. For a while in my twenties, after years of being very aware of the common thread running through an experience or feeling deja vu frequently, I stopped noticing.  The mundane became truly mundane, synchronicity wasn't something popping into my consciousness as I went about my life.  Last night I watched  urlLink Network  on DVD.  I hadn't seen the movie since I was a kid, too young to really "get" the film in any meaningful way.  For those who aren't familiar with Network, it's a fantastic film and creepily close to what we see now with the advent of Reality TV, modern shock talk shows, and "extreme" everything.  If you've every heard anyone quip, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!" it comes from this movie.  Several times over the coarse of the show, the mad prophet anchor tells people to get up, throw open their windows, stick their heads out, and scream that line or another in the same vein.  Anyway, the DVD ends and as I'm ejecting the disc, the last 5 minutes of whatever was on the Food Network pops up on the screen.  Happens to be an episode of  urlLink Good Eats  with our favorite theater-major-turned-food-guru,  urlLink Alton Brown .  It was an episode I'd never seen before, something about cole slaw.  The episode draws to a close, and one of the other actors (Good Eats uses a lot of skits and actors as hapless food buffoons to give Brown a stage from which to share his particular quirky brand of cooking savvy) asks if Alton has anything else he wants to say.  Sleepily, I click to attention as I hear him say, "Well, yes.  I want you all to go to your windows, throw them open, stick your heads out and yell [something something something... I think the cartoon sound of my head whipping around as I did my double take drowned out exactly what he was saying]... I want SLAW!"  A younger Nikchick would have been convinced this was a sign of *something* to come.  The older Nikchick merely took note and delighted in the strange, entertaining event, and toddled off to bed.  I woke up to find that on the right hand, the Chair of an organization I volunteer for just made a major, last-moment decision to significantly alter an event in progress, and that decision is mightily unpopular with volunteers, administrators, and participants alike.  Major shit-storm to ensue in T-minus 3, 2, 1.  Hoorah.  On the left hand, I was asked to step into an Executive Committee position with another organization where I serve as a volunteer as the position is being vacated after (as near as I can tell) a series of rather unpleasant personal interactions between a member of the board and one or more of the organization's key staff members.  Half of me feels that I should step up and help the organization in any way I can, the other half of me wants to scream that I've had enough of their stupid bickering and they can all go to hell in a hand basket for all I care.  I have no doubt this situation will cause no end of chaos with the organization and it reminds me why I hate politics so deeply.  Anyone wanting to enact even the most benign change, to pursue some ideal for the common good, is pulled down to roll around in the mud and suffer for their good intentions.  It's enough to make a person want to pack it in, I swear.  Definitely looking forward to my "girls' weekend away" in San Diego at the end of this week.

      Oh hooray, the cocktail party went swimmingly!  It was wonderful to have a full house and see so many of the people we don't see day-to-day anymore.  I managed to make the correct amount of food, and there are very few leftovers to deal with today.  The giant bowl of non-alcoholic punch went nearly untouched, to my surprise.  I must say that the response to my menu was very enthusiastic, with people coming up to me over the evening to remark on the food, ask for recipes, or just tell me how great everything looked.  I must give props to  urlLink Betty Crocker's Entertaining Basics  for this one.  So much of the menu came out of this book!  Poached Samon Appetizer with Honey-Mustard Sauce; Marinated Peppers, Olives and Cheese; Roasted Vegetables with Creamy Caesar Dip; Spinach Dip served in a bread bowl; Hot Crab Dip; Sweet-and-Sour Meatballs; both recipes for the punch I served.  I also made a tray of chocolate- and white chocolate-dipped strawberries that were very yummy.  Had some  urlLink palmiers  left over as well, so I enjoyed strawberries and palmiers with my morning coffee.  Decadent!

      The space shuttle Columbia is gone, broke up on re-entry this morning.  Chris's response was that it's like the 80s all over again and I look around me to see how true it is.  Not only the mourning of the loss of the spacecraft and those aboard, but the Republican controlled government, the threat of nukes being loosed on the world, and let's not forget tax cuts of the rich and the so-called desperate need for a missile defense program (back in the day it was known as Star Wars, and twenty years of development hasn't made it any more effective).  At least the Columbia wasn't being broadcast live into the classrooms of small children when it blew.  Small miracles.

      The cocktail party is on for tomorrow night.  Technically "tonight" since the date clock has advanced, but there is still a "night's" sleep between me and it, so I continue to think of what tomorrow brings.  If tonight's sleep is anything like last night's sleep, I will be greeting the sun before insomnia finally stops kicking my ass and I get a little shut eye.  Ah well, all the better to party the night away, I suppose. Kate is safely ensconced in Canada for the weekend with her dad, so at least once I fall asleep I can stay asleep for a while.  Several people waited to the last minute to RSVP, so my attendee list doubled today, but I've come to expect that from our group of friends.  My weekend agenda includes going to the store to pick up last minute items (like fresh bread) and to fill out our stock of alcohol and mixers.  I spent an hour putting together a dozen or so wine charms while watching Law and Order tonight.  I was inspired to do that after seeing  urlLink  ljc's Shrinky Dink wine charms .  They came out pretty well.  I used a bunch of wacky charms and buttons from the bead-craft aisle at Michaels, because I'm no artist.  Just taking on this small project reminded me of how much I really love little crafty projects.    For part of high school I lived in rural Minnesota, in a small old farmhouse that my dad rented.  It was surrounded on all sides by corn fields and held a great old barn that was now completely unused but not yet falling into total ruin.  My dad fits well in rural Minnesota, taking pleasure in duck and pheasant hunting, fishing and ice fishing, maybe playing golf or softball in the summer.  Long, cold, dark winter nights never bothered him much, but I took up crafting to pass the time.  If we'd had the internet back then, I suppose I would have spent time online and the world might not have seemed so close and quiet; I don't recall even having cable TV at the farmhouse, though I did go into "town" often to watch TV or listen to records with my boyfriend who lived within the four square blocks that make up the city of Dundas.  I passed the time in Canada when I was living up there with no authorization to work or go to school, by cross-stitching a huge, ambitious jungle scene, 12" x 12".  As a relative novice, I should have been much more daunted by the undertaking.  Instead, I threw myself into the effort and came away with a really lovely finished piece.  I gave it to my then in-laws for their young son.  I haven't seen that boy since he was in pre-school, and since they're no longer my in-laws, I doubt I'll ever see them (or the cross-stitch) again.  I was raised in the I'm Ok, You're Ok era and it was made clear to me from a very early age that I could "be" anything I wanted to be.  Not that I could "do" anything I wanted to do, but *BE* anything.  I could *be* a fire fighter or an astronaut or a doctor or the President of the United States.  The message I took from that teaching was that what you do is who you are, and that if you weren't *doing* something Very Important then YOU weren't very important.  Being a homemaker was something the adult women of my youth were struggling to leave behind, it was a punishment, a waste of a woman's potential.  Those close to me have heard me lament more than once that I don't have a calling, that there's nothing I'm better at than anything else, that I don't know what to "do" with myself.  A large part of that is definitely because of my childhood belief that what you do is who you are, and you'd better not waste that potential, girl!  The question of what I want to do is intimately wrapped up in who I want to be.  The honest truth is that I enjoy homemaker pursuits more than any other profession I've tried (or considered).  Not saying that I want to sit home watching soap operas and playing bridge, but I do so love to cook and decorate and organize.  I'm not crazy about cleaning, but I'm a lot more enthused about it at 33 than I have ever been before.  That "you can do anything" upbringing means I'm not merely hosting cocktail parties, but I'm there and involved in every aspect of the care of my home.  I installed our garage door opener.  I've assembled and installed every shelving unit, rack, or utility device in the house.  I've purchased the computer stations, the desks, the tools.  I fix the blown fuses, replace the light bulbs, keep the dust buster charged, defrost the fridge, fix the leaky pipes, hang curtains and put up wall paper.  I know the recycling and garbage pick-up schedules, I mow the lawn, trim the trees, put up and take down the Christmas lights.  It would be quite a reward to be able to do that work as my only work, to be in charge of running the house.    Each time I plan one of these little soirees, I can't help reflecting on how much I enjoy those typical homemaker, house-wife pursuits, right down to selecting plushy hand towels and matching decorative soaps, or making wine charms, or cross-stitching some elaborate pillow cover. God, am I really saying that I want to be Martha Stewart?  There's a horrifying thought to send me off to dream-land!

      Traffic Court  Tomorrow morning I have a date with traffic court.  While in Renton, I parked in a one-hour space for a meeting that actually ran more like 90 minutes.  Sure enough, I was ticketed by the time I rushed back to my car.  Boo!  But worse, I was also cited for not having up-to-date license tabs on my car, the fine for which was double the parking fine!  Ironically, I was parked half a block away from the Department of Licensing, and I was able to go over there and get a print-out of my records, showing that I had, indeed, paid for my tabs some six weeks before receiving the ticket.  Armed with this evidence, I waltzed myself over to the Renton City Hall to try to take care of the situation right away.  I was certainly willing to accept my guilt at parking over-time (much as it's irritating) but I was not so willing to just take it in the behind on the no tabs fine when I could easily prove I'd paid the tabs on my car!  Of course, because I was dealing with the government, nothing was as easy as all that.  No, I had to enter a plea, and they scheduled me for a court date.  I wouldn't have picked April Fool's Day as the day for my court appearance (I can be superstitious that way) but it was not up to me.  Tomorrow I go down to Renton City Hall, once again armed with my evidence.  It will undoubtedly be a waste of time.  I predict I will have to wait a good long time for my turn, only to have the whole thing resolved one way or another in less than five minutes.  Either they're going to accept the proof from the department of licensing, or they're going to say tough titty.  Probably completely at the whim of the presiding judge.  Fingers crossed that I get my way on the matter!

      Wargames  In the context of games and gaming, my friend Robin Laws pointed several of us to  urlLink this article .    I'm reminded of the American Revolution and the Battle of Bunker Hill.  The better trained, better armed, superior forces of the British lined up to fight against the colonists, only to find that the rules had changed.  The would-be Americans didn't shirk from using "partisans" and "irregulars" nor did they hesitate to use guerilla warfare.  "All out war for all out victory" was the new doctrine.  The British eventually won Bunker Hill, but they lost the war.   They had won the battle, but at a terrible cost: out of 2,200 troops, 268 British soldiers and officers had been killed; another 828 were wounded. The Americans also suffered heavy casualties with 115 killed and 305 wounded. The British army’s military victory at the battle of Bunker Hill was a moral victory for the colonists, however. Colonists throughout America realized that the conflict was no longer just a rebellion of Bostonians and other Massachusetts colonists against British occupation. They had proved to themselves that, united, they had the ability and the character to confront the superior force of the British army. The cost of British victory was so great that serious doubts were raised about English leadership; many now understood that war with the colonies would be hard, long, and expensive to both sides.

       Weekend Part Deux  I had planned to do some gardening yesterday, as spring is definitely sproinging up in Seattle.  Yesterday ended up having several beautiful sun-breaks (interspersed with rolling grey clouds and sprinkles, of course) and the temperature got to be a glorious 70 degrees.  However, I wasn't even yet out of bed before that plan changed!  Instead of gardening, I accompanied Chris on a jaunt to Ray and Christine's place, where the Germans and Russians were scheduled to fight to the last chit in true  urlLink Advanced Squad Leader  glory.  Chris has been searching for someone to play ASL with him for years, so when Ray relocated to Seattle, it was a match made in heaven.  Upon hearing that Chris and Ray had arranged a play date, Christine passed a message through Ray to Chris to me that we should get together and do "girly things" while the boys played.  So long, potting soil, hello pedicures!  Christine and I indulged in some Passion Tea, browsed the garden store, and stopped at  urlLink Pasta & Co  to pick up fixings for dinner.  Off to the local QFC for wine and sodas, and we were set.  Ray whipped up some homemade pasta when we got back, Chris shook up a few martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives and we noshed and caught up on gossip. We hadn't seen Christine since some time in January, though Ray's dropped by the house a couple of times since then.  Plenty to catch up on. We hung around for dinner, downed a couple of bottles of wine, and eventually dissolved into talk of games and politics.  The four of us are of a similar mindset: disenfranchised liberals who look with no small amount of horror and disgust at how international crises are playing out.  It was refreshing to talk to someone on "my side" of the issue who has an informed, logical opinion.  I've about had it with the gloating knee-jerk conservatives who assume that I oppose the war only because I hate George W. Bush to his core and that I must be some sort of peacenik nutjob completely divorced from reality. Ug.  I can feel my ire rising just thinking about it.  It was good to vent and commiserate with people I like and respect, and especially nice to do so without stumbling across any unfortunate revelations about their political beliefs.  Anyway, we called it a night, and I properly paced myself so that I didn't collapse in a heap and unintentionally spend the night, as I've so often done after similar nights at Ray's (especially if, after a late dinner and several drinks we throw in a DVD in the dark, basement home theater: that's just asking for me to pass out for the night on the couch.  I'm so old and weak.).  This morning I slept in decadently late, rousing myself just in time to shower and change and dash off to  urlLink Etta's Seafood  where Chris and I were meeting my friend Tim.  I've known Tim since he and his college buddies were playtesters and game demoers for Ars Magica, back in the day.  They were always referred to, fondly, as "The Michigan Guys" and I've lost touch completely with most of them.  Tim, however, was working in the computer biz in the Bay Area and regularly played games with other friends of mine, also guys from the game industry.  When he found out he'd be relocating to Seattle, courtesy of  urlLink Uncle Bill , my friends said, "Well, you've got to look up Nicole," and so we met up again.  Had a fantastic brunch at Etta's and talked about the various ways in which our interests have caused us to travel similar paths (trips to London, visits to  urlLink Skywalker Ranch , contacts with people in various industries who used to be gamers, what have you).  And wouldn't you know, while we were finishing brunch, who should stroll past the window toward  urlLink Pike Place Market  but Ray and Christine!  No doubt they were off to do some shopping for whatever typical Sunday meal they're planning to whip up tonight.  I'm sure  urlLink Tynes  will be posting about it in his blog, since Mr. Johnny spends a goodly amount of time cooking, eating, and hanging out at Ray and Christine's as well.  Heh heh.  Before parting ways with Tim, we strolled through the market ourselves and bought some sausages at  urlLink Ulis  and some fresh flowers, too colorful and spring-y to pass up!  Tim is going to be living in corporate housing hell for the next 5 months or so, while his house is being built.  The good news for us is that when he finally gets settled in, he's going to be living down in  urlLink Renton , which we're much more likely to visit than any of the places we need to cross a bridge to get to.  I hope to introduce Tim to the rest of "the gang" and maybe integrate him into some gaming, I think he'd fit in nicely with the rest of our very nice friends.  Tim's specifically building his house to include a "gaming loft" where he plans to have a pool table and game area.  Nice to have another old gamer friend in the area!  Chris is putting together an army for a 40K game with Jess this afternoon, and I'll be driving up to Burlington to pick Kate up from her weekend with her dad.  It's been a fun, action-packed weekend.  Now I just have to buckle down and get everything in order before Kate and I leave for Arizona for spring break.  We fly out on Thursday night!  Time is just flying by.

      WrestleMania  Got together last night with a friend who is in town for  urlLink WrestleMania .  So weird to think of people coming across the country for something like this!  We met him at his hotel and then sauntered five blocks straight downhill to  urlLink The Bookstore  bar at the  urlLink Alexis Hotel .  Back when Ray and Christine lived in Chicago but came to town on business, the Bookstore was their favorite haunt.  We looked around for Christian, the server who always had the best gossip about what celebs were in town, but there was only the slightly bored and irritated waitress to be found.   Hal had been going on about his ephiphany over bourbon in Vegas, so I went to their booze list and asked for some help picking a bourbon to try.  Ms. Irritated didn't seem in the mood to help me expand my horizons and gave a couple half-hearted suggestions off the list, so I gave it the ol' college try and picked one at random.  Turned out to be $13 a shot, and not the kind of thing that would make me wonder what I'd been missing.  Shoulda stuck to the  urlLink Macallan 18-year , at least I know that's what I like.  It was good to hang with Zev.  We reminisced about the time we all found ourselves in Germany at the  urlLink Essen Game Fair .  Several of us had hooked up for dinner, wandering into a steak house of some sort where we were fairly unwelcome Americans.  After hanging around too late at the restaurant, we searched for somewhere to carry on our rowdy conversation (extra-exhuberent because of riotous Paul, our loud, old-school-punker, stereotypical New Yorker friend) we found that Zev's hotel had no lobby to speak of, so we moved to the room.  At some point, while we were in the midst of loudly discussing sexual deviancy or Nazis or stories of Paul's adventures, the phone rang.  Mild-mannered Zev answers the phone and from our side of the conversation we hear "Hello...No...Yes, ok, sorry.  Yes, sorry.  Ok."  We wait expectantly to be filled in on what's happening.  Zev hangs up.  Apparently the front desk had called up and said "Have you a fire?  No?  Then perhaps you could be quiet?  Your neighbors are trying to sleep."  Ouch.  We tried talking quietly for another half an hour or so, but invariably the volume and intensity of the conversation would creep up and Paul would be half-shouting and Zev would be spasming "Shh, SHHH!"  We decided it would be best to sneak out of the hotel before we got Zev evicted from his room.  Good times.  Maybe we can do it again this year.  We tried to vacate The Bookstore in favor of cheap late-night eats at  urlLink McCormick and Schmicks , but it was crowded with young couples and hipsters who'd staked out their turf early.  We decided to pack it in and head home instead.  I briefly considered taking Zev to the Zig Zag, but since he doesn't drink I didn't want to drag him all that way from his hotel so he could drink water there too.  Judging from  urlLink other reports , sounds like we missed out on crossing paths with some other fun-loving friends out for the night.

      Rhetoric  My daughter was born in Canada.  Both her parents are American citizens, born and raised, but her father has lived in Canada since going abroad for his Masters and Doctorate at the University of British Columbia.  He continues to live in Canada by choice, and I can't say that I blame him.  Vancouver, in particular, is a beautiful, comfortable place to live and I personally loved the time I spent there.  I would not hesitate to live in Vancouver again, should the opportunity present itself.   urlLink This kind of rhetoric  does cause me to worry a little, especially with my precious girl passing back and forth across the border once or twice a month.  I hate to see international politics interferring with her family, but I've seen hostilities building between Canadians and Americans over the last few years (over NAFTA, over salmon, over timber, over marijuana, over terrorism, and now over war) and I've seen an increasing disruption in the border crossings, the scrutiny of our travel, and I can feel a brewing citizenship/nationalism issue in our futures.  I have to this point relied on Kate's father to make her claim of Canadian citizenship for her.  I'm thinking that it might be in her best interest to have that secured for her, in no uncertain terms, before things turn even uglier for Americans than they are currently.  When I gave birth to my baby in Canada, I was so relieved!  Even then, in the mid-1990s, I was aware of what a greatly superior gift Canadian citizenship would be for her.  I did not like the Rush Limbaugh influenced, gloating conservative tone the United States had taken, even in those days.  It's certainly not gotten any better, in my opinion, over the last 10 years (though taking a particularly distasteful turn under the current administration).  I'm glad Kate has the "out" of being able to retreat to Canada.  It's not out of the question to think that we all might relocate there someday... the United States frightens rather than inspires, more with each passing week.  It's not difficult for me to imagine a day when I will not be able to call myself an American, when the difference between the shameful conduct of my government and my morals and ethics will reach the point of no return, where the only acceptable option is to leave for a new home in a country more closely aligned with my views.    Canada is not perfect, but damn it's a lovely place nonetheless.

      Headache  I've been prone to incapacitating headaches since my early teens.  I often went in for headache screenings with my general practitioner back before MRIs and migrane specialists were available, and I never received much in the way of a diagnosis.  I was told that I probably didn't have migranes, because I didn't see auras or throw up.  My doctor didn't appreciate my generally high pain tolerance.  After a few years of blessed relief from most headaches, the really bad ones seem to be back with a vengeance.  During a weekend-long meeting we hosted here at the house I spent most of the time in bed, in a dark room, in pain.  It hit suddenly, without warning, behind my right eye and though the pain decreased a few times over the weekend (enough for me to get up and participate in life a little) it took three or four days to fully go away.  Last night I was suddenly hit by another of these incapacitating headaches.  It is the worst headache in recent memory.  I might have had one to rival it in my teens or early twenties, but this was one that truly incapacitated me.  I feared that I was going to vomit several times, and lay in bed just whimpering from the pain until I finally fell asleep.  Awful.  If I had better health insurance, I'd go in to have it checked.  Our insurance is more of the "Oh my god, I broke something!" variety and since the sum diagnosis of my headaches in the past has been "Yep, you sure do have headaches." I'm reluctant to spend the time or the money to hear once again there's little to be done.  Of course, I occasionally twinge with worry that it's a tumor [cue Arnold "It's not a toomah!" ] and by not going to the doctor to be checked out I'm risking my life, but I've been waved off so many times it's hard to overcome my conditioning.  I hope that whatever is currently going on with my body will ebb again and I'll go back to the relatively headache-free state I've enjoyed for the last couple of years.

      Food Bliss  My new issue of Cooking Light arrived today. Typically, when a new issue arrives, I look through it greedily, in case there is anything that I can make without running to the store, this very day.  Today, sadly, the pantry was "bare" for the snappy recipes I'd have liked to make.  Tomorrow, however, is another day!  I've developed a system for going through the magazine and noting which recipes I'd like to try this month.  Usually I make note of a dozen more than I end up making, but that's entirely because the magazine is so deliciously attractive.    My system is to write down the name of the intriguing recipe on the right hand side of a legal pad, along with the magazine issue and page number, e.g. Scalloped Potatoes with Shallots, Mushrooms, Roasted Garlic and Thyme. On the left hand side I make nore of the ingredients needed for that recipe, e.g. 4 heads garlic, shallots, mushrooms, balsamic vinegar, milk, flour, thyme, Yukon Gold potatoes, Pecorino Romano cheese.    This list then doubles as my shopping list (or pantry double-check list).  I've found that I'm distractable and forgetful enough that it really helps to have the shopping list broken out by recipe.  I can't count the number of times before I broke my list out by recipe that I came home with all the ingredients but one (usually something crucial, like buying all the marinade ingredients but not getting the bay scallops) because I forgot which ingredients were for which recipes.  This usually results in having stray cans of artichoke hearts or jars of pimento hanging around the pantry, looking for a home.  After two years of this behavior, I had quite the mish-mash in my pantry!  I look forward to game night every week, if only to have the chance to try out another one of my Cooking Light recipes.  This weekend I'm hoping the weather holds enough for me to go out and do a little yard work.  I'd like to get my garden prepped and transplant some of the herbs to the empty flower box.  I'm definitely ready for spring.  My friend Ashley was recently diagnosed as having Adult Attention Deficit Disorder.  She and I could be twins, our "symptoms" are so the same!  She's been evaluated, has done lots of reading on it, has taken a spate of online tests.  We score similarly on the online tests and I recognize myself in some of the light reading I've done (though nothing as in-depth as Ashley has done).  I suppose I should talk to my doctor about getting an evaluation myself, just to be sure.  I would be pleased if I could effectively treat some of my symptoms, especially my distractibility and forgetfulness.  Losing my keys or forgetting my lunch in the microwave happens so often, it's a running joke here at the house.  Even Kate gives me a hard time about it!

      Vegas Recap  Las Vegas was awesome.  The GAMA Trade Show was stellar this year, with three halls of exhibitors and record numbers of retail and distributor attendees.  Monday was largely a day for registrations, booth set-up, and seminars.  Touched base with some good friends and started the convention off on the right foot by holding the official Green Ronin dinner at  urlLink Picasso , a French restaurant in the Bellagio hotel that is simply out of this world.  It was, without question, the best meal I have ever had.  The service was like a dream, the food and wine were outstanding, the atmosphere was classy, soothing, calming and a welcome relief from the hustle of the long day of travel and convention prep.  Simply amazing, I can't possibly convey how glorious that two-hour, five-course meal was.  Tuesday  urlLink Green Ronin  co-hosted a brunch for retail and distributor buyers. The room was standing room only: we had been told to anticipate ~500 retailers and in the end there were over 2100 badges sold, over 600 retail stores represented.  The response to our announcements was enthusiastic, and there was much buzz around the room when we talked about some of our upcoming products, like  urlLink Cartographica , our book of color fantasy maps, or  urlLink Bastards & Bloodlines , a book of half-breed fantasy monsters.  We were especially pleased by the response to our official announcement of our license to do a  urlLink game book  based on  urlLink The Nocturnals .  Tuesday we were also pleased and grateful that the members of the  urlLink Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design  chose to honor us with five Origins Awards nominations.   Game of the Year:  Mutants & Masterminds  Best Role-playing Game:  Mutants & Masterminds  Best Graphic Presentation of the Book Product:  Mutants & Masterminds  Best Role-playing Supplement:  Freeport: The City of Adventure  Best Game Accessory:  Pocket Grimoires   Tuesday wasn't *all* fun and games, though, because it was also the first day that the exhibitors halls were open to all attendees, and the booth was packed.  We talked until we were hoarse, we gave out hundreds of magazines, collected business cards, and stood until our feet ached.  The overwhelmingly positive response was wonderfully soothing after hunkering down all winter for what seemed like endless work on difficult projects.  It was all worth it to hear that those products were well-received.  Tuesday night we met with our sales and fulfillment partners  urlLink Osseum Entertainment  for yet more fine dining at Nobu's Hard Rock Casino branch. We had the chef's arrangement and it remains some of the best Asian cuisine I've ever enjoyed.  Though we didn't get our favorites off the menu, like the Shrimp in Spicy Creamy Sauce, or the Miso Black Cod, or the Tuna tartar, we were treated to plenty of other wonderful, unusual, creative dishes.  Yum, yum, I could eat my way through Las Vegas into bankruptcy, no problem.  Somewhere between Monday and Wednesday we discovered our website was hacked by a group claiming to be anti-war protesters.  They erased our front page and replaced it with an anti-war message.  I doubt they're really motivated by the war.  We've had trouble with Russian hackers who have exploited weaknesses in the program we use for our message boards in the past, and our webmaster has been tearing his hair out trying to keep ahead of them this week as they've continued to break into our website, erasing back-up files and tinkering with things they had no right to touch.  Very unpleasant, but essentially minor vandalism.  And we've gotten a lot of love from the fans as they've found out about it.  Wednesday was another day on the convention floor, and lots of meetings. Lunch with one of our favorite retailers, Jim Crocker and as always he provided us with some invaluable insight into the industry from the retail perspective. Wednesday night we had a business dinner with two distributor reps (Marcelo and Nicole), our good friend Jeff (who does some freelance graphic design for us on occasion) and the Green Ronin staff.  This time it was dinner at Red Square in the Mandalay Bay.  Once again, wonderful wonderful.  Sadly I had to call it an early night because of an early morning Board of Directors meeting.  War breaking out made people a little more troubled and subdued than usual.  Thursday was the last day of the show and also the day I had to do the most politics.  I hate politics.  However, I have to say that the meeting was one of the best I've attended in the three years I've been serving, and I am quite excited about the direction the organization is taking. It's especially a relief to remove some of the obstructionist board members that have been serving in recent memory.  People come to the board with their own agendas, obviously, but it's refreshing to no longer be under the thumb of people who are determined to be obstructionist bullies.  We get so much more done!    Thursday night I missed going out for dinner with my friend John Kovalic and his lovely wife Judith because I had a Board of Directors dinner.  That is probably the most disappointing thing that happened to me in Las Vegas!  Dinner was unforgivably slow in coming, an hour to get appetizers, over two hours to get our entrees.  So slow that people had to leave to catch their planes without being able to eat the food they'd ordered!  I was furious, starving, and had a miserable time because of it.  Sometime after 10:30 I managed to hook up with Hal and Chris again, and we'd talked about going to a popular bar called Ghost Bar to have a little fun but I was not up to taking yet another cab ride out somewhere to *start* an evening of fun at 11:00 pm.  Must be getting old, but I decided to go up and go to bed instead.  Besides, the war footage was playing on the bar televisions at the hotel, and I just wasn't feeling very jolly or celebratory.  Friday we checked out of the hotel, shipped our convention display home, and had a few hours to enjoy ourselves before catching the plane home.  We decided to do something we would never do at home: we went to a shooting range where you can fire automatic weapons!  The place is called  urlLink The Gun Store .  I believe the Thompson was the hands down favorite of the three weapons we tried.  Chris kept a spent casing as a souvenir, which turned out to be a slight problem once we got to the airport (but only after they made me pour my iced-coffee drink out of its clear plastic to-go cup into a less threatening paper cup).  Apparently a completely spent and harmless shell casing needed to be examined by three different people before we were allowed to fully pass through security "just in case" (though just in case *what* was never clear).  This update is long enough for now, I suppose.  I will be leaving shortly to go pick Kate up from my mother's house and heading back right away.  Then we're done traveling for a while, until April.

      Airport  Those who know me have heard me ranting and raging in the past about airline security over the last few years. Ironically, I've been much less irate about airline security since the feds took over the screenings (and since airports installed enough employees and equipment to handle the job). In my most recent travels, I've been screened politely and efficiently by people who speak and understand clear English.  These are appreciated and much needed improvements, necessary for passenger compliance and security.   urlLink This  episode (originating in sweet home Seattle), on the other hand, is really over the line.  People crushing their  urlLink Dixie Chicks  CDs is evidence enough of human hypocrisy and pettiness.  This Seattle baggage incident, though, is EXACTLY why the TSA's  urlLink next step in security screening  is a terrible idea.  Your personal information, credit reports, traffic tickets, goodness knows what else, passing through the hands of anonymous self-righteous "security screeners" in order to make a "security assessment" before you're allowed to board a plane?  Yikes.  (Yes, I've linked to a lefty news source about CAPPS II.  It's my blog, and I've had enough conservative, war-mongering media for today, so screw it!)  Leaving for Las Vegas in a mere 6 hours.  Suppose I should get to packing... wouldn't want to be late to the airport.

That's the thing about blogging that's different than writing journals by hand.  If I'd just spent an hour writing in my pen and paper journal, it would still be there when I put the pen down.  Grr.  I'm not going to write that all up again.  I'll report back on the trip after the fact, but now I don't have time to waste.  16 hours and we've got to be at the airport, convention display in hand.

      Missing Children  I don't know a parent who doesn't worry about things beyond their control that could happen to their children.  Bullies, diseases, car wrecks, bicycle accidents, drownings.  It's always out there, on the fringes of your perceptions, "something" could happen.  The fear of losing your child altogether, of having someone abduct them, of being unable to protect them from whatever migh be done to them in your absense, that fear strikes terror into the hearts of even the most steely parents I know.  A missing child is a living hell, not to be wished on anyone.  The case of Elizabeth Smart, returned to her family alive after being abducted by a stranger, has reminded me not to give up hope. Long after she'd passed from the public spotlight, and long after many assumed that she was dead or missing forever, all it took was one person to keep her in mind when they saw something strange and she was recovered.  This is significant to me, because I also know a family who is suffering the same pain of not knowing that the Smarts lived with all these months. My friend's nephew has been missing since October 2002, an 11 year old boy who disappeared while riding his bike to a friend's house.  They have not given up, and the  urlLink Elizabeth Smart  case has reminded me not to give up on them. With that in mind, I've come to the diverse and widespread crowd we have here in order to spread the word and to ask you all, just to keep an eye open, keep Shawn Hornbeck in the back of your mind the way concerned citizens did with Elizabeth Smart. Maybe, just maybe, someone will see him and bring him home to his family, too.      urlLink http://www.shawnhornbeck.com/   Thanks everyone

      Fever  Kate stayed home today because she woke up with a fever.  When I called the school, I did so with hopes that she'd be going to school tomorrow, but they've got a "24-hour rule" that kids can't return to school until they've passed 24-hours with no fever.  She was still feverish when I put her to bed, so she won't be going to school tomorrow either, even if she wakes up "better."  The woman who answered the phone when I called Kate in sick dashed my hopes further when she told me that "it's going around" and they've had kids out of school with fever for six days or more.  Because we work at home, it's very difficult to have Kate home for days on end.  She's an energetic kid, even when she's home sick and she needs attention. I'd drop everything for her in a minute if she was seriously ill, but it's harder when she's just bored and restless and when the big trade show of the year is looming in less than a week.  I'm especially disappointed that she's missing school this week, because she's going to miss school all next week as well.  The aforementioned trade show is during the week, in Las Vegas, and it's neither possible to miss it nor practical to bring her along.  I'd already arranged to bring her to my mother's in Oregon for the duration of the show.  Looks like I'm going to have to have her doing some home study so she won't fall behind her class.  We played a game of  urlLink Mag*Blast  tonight.  Kate has developed into a good little game player already.  I wish I had the stamina to play more often. She still needs a little help understanding some of the non-attack cards in the game, but she delights in making the sound effects (and is sporting enough to laugh with us when she was caught not making the required sound effect, much more mature than I was at her age) and successfully added up the total point value of her cards into the 20s.  Her teacher has commented on her good math skills, and the results from her  urlLink COGAT  testing were in the high 90s.  Now I'm left to wonder if it's the gamer environment that's helped shape her, or if she was just born with good math genes.  (Which must have come from her dad, since I'm not known for my math prowess!)

      Love and Marriage  Yesterday was the wedding reception for my dear friend Evan and his lovely bride.  At my own wedding I did not have the traditional Bridesmaid or Maid of Honor, but chose Evan to be my Bridesman.  Regardless of my mother-in-law's insistence on calling him "the other usher" he was much more than "an usher" at my wedding.  In fact, he went above and beyond the call of duty, as he accepted the role before becoming unemployed in the great pre-recession of '01.  He did not let his jobless status keep him from flying across the country to stand at my side, I didn't even find out directly that he was sick for most of the trip!  He made sure I had a drink and that some food and cake were saved for me as I was dragged hither and yon for wedding photos and ritual dancing.  He even rented the rental car after I was a complete space case and left my purse (complete with all credit cards, money, and passports) on the plane.   Evan's a super guy.  In addition to being my Dude of Honor, he's also been kind enough to drive me to the airport on multiple occasions, watch my tomatoes while I was gone convention-hopping in the summer (I should have been more specific about that request, as I meant "watch" as in "tend" not as in "observe them withering" but that's neither here nor there), house-sit (and test out the alarm system while he's at it), bring dark beer and cheesy chips to game night, and slave away as our greatly-appreciated but sorely-underpaid webmaster for our little start-up company.  For quite a long time I could not believe that smart, fun-loving, cuties were not lining up to have a chance with this guy!  Well, it turns out, he was just waiting for the right girl.  And he's definitely found her.  They radiate "rightness" when they're together and, as I expressed during a nerve wracking off-the-cuff toast to the bride and groom, Evan has blossomed.  Blossomed isn't exactly the right word, the word I was probably looking for is "unfolded" I think.  He's always been a quiet guy, a sly boots quick with a quip when you least expect it, and since falling in love he's been all that and more...all the best parts of him that we've always enjoyed have been amplified.  It's a wonderful, wonderful joy to share wedding beginnings with dear friends. It was great to meet so many other people who love our friends, who know things about them that we don't, who know those things about them that we all know. There are far too few times in our lives where we unabashedly share our love for one another!  Happy wedding, Sassmaster.  Happy beginning, happy life, happy everything.  You two deserve no less, and I hope you have the best of everything and more.

      Shanghai Knights  It seems like it's getting more and more difficult to find family entertainment.  Now, I will be the first to admit that I have pretty loose standards about what Kate is allowed to watch.  She's seen plenty of  urlLink Jackie Chan , she's seen lots of anime, she's even watched a couple of episodes of  urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer  with us.  We've watched PG-13 movies together and even a few R-rated movies.   urlLink Fellowship of the Ring  was no problem for her.  However, she's still a bit on the young side for things like  urlLink The Recruit  or  urlLink How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days , regardless of their PG-13 ratings.   urlLink The Quiet American  or  urlLink Tears of the Sun  are far in the future.  While searching tonight for a movie to go see as a family, we considered  urlLink Daredevil , but the savage reviews put me off.   urlLink Shanghai Knights  was just what the doctor ordered (having seen  urlLink Shanghai Noon  with Kate, she knew what to expect) and blessedly saved us from having to consider  urlLink Kangaroo Jack  or  urlLink Jungle Book 2 .  [Brief rant: Are we so creatively bankrupt that the only thing we can think to create for "child friendly" movies are so-called sequel movies to 50-year old "classic" cartoons?  What is with the spate of re-hashed movies like Cinderella 2, Jungle Book 2, or worst of all  urlLink 101 Dalmatians II  (not to be confused with  urlLink 102 Dalmatians , the live-action sequel to the  urlLink live-action remake  of the  urlLink "classic" cartoon )?!  Hello, Disney? Can't you even pretend to have an original thought by at least giving us "sequels" with somewhat evocative names like Cinderella and the Temple of Ultimate Evil, or Mowgli: the Parent Trap?!  ARGH.]  Anyway, Shanghai Knights was bland, inoffensive entertainment for the whole family.  There were a few chuckles, many groaners, and while some may complain that Jackie Chan wasn't doing his "Jackie Chan Thing" enough, I'll admit to being relieved that he's cut out some of the wild "stunts for stunts sake" craziness that has marred some of his other American films.  I love Jackie Chan and I greatly feared that as he aged he would continue to push himself to do jaw-dropping stunts until it killed him.  NO threat of that in this movie, and that's ok with me.  Owen Wilson does his Owen Wilson patter. It's exactly what I expected it would be and it saved me from kid-movie hell.  Woot!  If you're looking for a decent "kid movie" I can recommend  urlLink The Wild Thornberrys Movie  with a clear conscience.  If only there were more quality movies like that out there for us!

      Patriotism  \Pa"tri*ot*ism\, n. [Cf. F. patriotisme.] Love of country; devotion to the welfare of one's country; the virtues and actions of a patriot; the passion which inspires one to serve one's country. --Berkley.  Source: Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, © 1996, 1998 MICRA, Inc.   This is the reason given by one of Washington State's representatives ( urlLink "It's an issue of patriotism," ) who walked out of the chamber as an invited Imam gave the opening prayer for the session.  This on the heels of our leader George W. Bush taking time out from his war-mongering to spend a minute flogging his "faith-based initiative" plan.   urlLink One of his recent speeches  was full of language such as "... governments can and should support effective social services provided by religious people, so long as they work and as long as those services go to anyone in need, regardless of their faith. And when government gives that support, it is equally important that faith-based institutions should not be forced to change the character or compromise their prophetic role. " and " I think the charities helping the needy, it should not matter if there is a rabbi on the board, or a cross on the wall, or crescent on the wall, or religious commitment in the charter. "  I guess the President's religion-loving message didn't manage to circulate down to some of his party members out here in the wilds of Washington.  I also came across pro-war organization, based in Kirkland, calling themselves "the true voice" of America. I've watched their pro-war television commercial. Once again, as with the first Gulf War, we're being told to "support our troops" as if the the lives of our soldiers are casino chips with no value until they're cashed in.  Is it so unbelievable that someone like me might be opposed to military invasion of Iraq precisely *because* I support our troops and don't feel forcing an irritating dictator out is worth the cost in human life?  Why the hell must I be painted as "a terrorist apologist" for trying to uphold decency, and wanting to employ diplomacy (actual diplomacy, not cowboy diplomacy ala Bush)?  See?  Jangly and inflamed all over again.

      Innate?  I've been pondering the seemingly inherent gentleness of Fred Rogers this week.  I've always wished that I was able to naturally be kind and gentle, calm, nurturing, whatever you want to call it.  I have a tender heart but that's not the same thing.  Fred Rogers saw people throwing pies at each other on television and was disgusted enough to make it his life's work to do something better.    Instead, I've always been jangly, edgy, feisty, inflamed.  My mother shielded me from as much of the world's ugliness as she could, but everyone opens their eyes eventually.  When I saw what was around me, I was overwhelmed by the wrongness of people.  I used my anger as a weapon to beat back what I could; I defended my junior high school friends from bullies, I wrote impassioned letters to the head of the corporation that sold my favorite sports team, often I just yelled "It's not fair!!" or "Why would someone do something like that?!" and I spent a lot of time in tears.  If I've had a motto, it's been "You want a fight, I'll give you a fight!"  I am not a calming influence by nature and for most of my life I have believed that you can't affect change without being  passionate and behaving like a wildfire or a volcano, changing the landscape of your life.  I know I'm getting older, and I hope I'm getting wiser.  Fred Rogers is evidence that you can change the landscape of your life without raging around.  He tended his landscape like a gardener, planting the seeds of change and tending their growth.  My self is so familiar as the confrontational wild woman, I haven't the first idea how to be otherwise. I've spent a good deal of my life wishing I could remake myself only to find that I am essentially the same as I ever was.  I appreciate all the more the people who have, for whatever reason, the right internal make up to flex a higher moral character and undertake (and succeed at) such meaningful endeavors.   Shit, I really need to find something to do with myself that doesn't have anything to do with the game industry.  Releasing the latest book of big, bad, icky monsters for your half-elven ranger and his party of intrepid heroes to slay is just not spiritually uplifting or morally significant, even if it has paid the bills.

      First Grade Love  My daughter has a boyfriend.  She's happy to tell anyone who will stand still long enough to hear her story, but only if it comes from her own lips.  Heaven forbid that I shoudl talk about it.  As she put it, "You don't know who I want to tell.  I'll tell who  I  want to tell."  Why she wants the nursing assistant in the pediatrician's office, or the crossing guard, or the office administrator we've never met before to know she has a boyfriend is a mystery I can't decipher.  What I can relate to is being in love with a boy from your kindergarten class.  For Kate, that boy is Alexander.  She wanders the house, saying his name in a dreamy voice.  She confesses her excitement at pending playdates and her heartbreak at long separations to her favorite comfort items: blankey and Ruffles (a floppy, stuffed dog only slightly smaller than she is. Thanks Grandma Carol and Grandpa Glenn!).  Alexander is a geek in the making, a sweet-hearted young boy with round framed Harry Potter-esque glasses who plays collectible card games and takes riding lessons.  He's adorable, in that bookish way that I myself find so attractive in my own men.  I'm not at all surprised Kate is completely in grade school love with him, and, from talking to his mother, it's clear the feeling is mutual.  For Valentine's Day Kate received a letter addressed to her in childish grade school scrawl.  Inside?  A Harry Potter valentine that she clutched to her heart with a teen-like squeal of delight.  For me, it was John Lahti.  John was in my preschool class.  He was small and lively, the youngest of three and a real rough and tumble boy.  How I enjoyed being rough and tumble with him!  We went through kindergarten and first grade together, until I moved away after my parents' divorce.  Even then we kept in touch through the occasional letter or phone call until I was in fifth grade.  I would beg to visit him whenever I ended up back in my birthplace for some visit or other.  The last such visit we had together was the summer between fourth and fifth grade.  John and I went to the corner store to spend my summer fun money on penny candies and had a "camera fight" while horsing around his house, in and out of various vehicles his family had parked around.  The idea of the camera fight was to sneak around and capture a photo of the other person without being seen.  We burned through a couple of rolls of film that way, sucking on candies the whole time.  We lost touch when John's family moved from  urlLink Ely  and I continued my westward migration with my mother and brother, moving every year or so.  I was definitely as completely, innocently smitten with John Lahti as Kate is with her little boy friend.  Unfortunately for Kate, Alexander is no longer attending her school, and he is very busy with activities: music classes, riding classes, chess club, cooking class. She pines for him and there is nothing I can do to help her.  I've tried to connect with his family to arrange play dates, but our schedules rarely synch up.  The one play date we successfully arranged went swimmingly, the kids listening to the insipid  urlLink Kidz Bop CDs  and pretending to air guitar around the house, lots of playing with toys that otherwise sit neglected for months at a time, lots of heart-to-heart kid time where they talk about the cool things they've read or watched or seen or done.  The kinds of things that seem profoundly important in a child's life, and so completely inconsequential in adulthood.  Tomorrow was supposed to be another one of these long-anticipated play dates, but Alexander's mom phoned while I was at the post office to say that she needs to reschedule for Friday if possible.  Kate met the news with tears and wailing.  "I've been waiting so patiently!  My heart is crushed!"  My poor girl, she feels everthing so intensely.  Like her mom that way... I do so understand her sometimes.  I'm glad Kate has this friend for whom whe can feel such adoration.  I know a lot of parents would cringe or worry over her blissful crush, but I don't.  Not now, not at age 7.  She is a wonderful, sensitive, passionate girl and there is much time for disappointment, rejection, limitations, and difficulties ahead of her. I'm glad she has time to experience acceptance, fulfillment, possibilities and adoration for a while first.

      I am woman, hear me whine  For the umpteenth time this week I've been called "Sir," by some freaking waitron.  Damn it, I am not a man!  Just because I don't dress to flaunt my boobies all over the place, or plaster myself with cosmetics, is it so impossible for people to see that I'm a chick??  Ok, so I do wear my hair in a short cut, and I do like to wear my MagiNation ball cap when I'm bumming around town.  But couldn't I at least be mistaken for a lesbian?  At least butch lesbian chicks are still  chicks .  Bah. It's enough to drive me into a little black dress and go-go boots.

      Chris left today for a week in New York City.  It took some applied pressure, but we finally managed to convince him not to bring his laptop with him.  The poor man needs the mental break, and the chances were slim of him actually getting any work done in between visiting friends, bachelor parties, weddings, receptions, and whatever else he decides to do while he's there.  Better to not even take it along, than to take it along and then be concerned with checking his e-mail, trying to handle things he's not supposed to be worrying about, and generally feeling bad because he feels he "should be" working.  This leaves me with a few things on my plate that I didn't really expect to be handling, but it's nothing I can't take care of.  I feel really empowered to tackle things regarding the business.  Weird that simply being *alone* during the day has such a dramatic effect.  Today I must get to Renton to check the PO Box and several orders need to go out, as well as support materials for some upcoming conventions.  I'm also trying to fit in a visit with a friend from junior high school (who is passing through town), a meeting with Osseum (picking up our check in time to get it to the bank), and praying that Kate's school isn't having an early-dismissal day today (so I can squeeze a couple extra hours out of the day).  Tired just thinking about it (or is that because I was up at 5:30 to take Chris to the airport?).

      I have a good friend who, like me, can be somewhat explosive when provoked.  When I knew him only through his online persona, I commented to friend and foe alike that I was going to punch him in the mouth if I ever met him in person.  He's such a sweet person  in person  though, that ol' punch in the mouth never happened.  That's not to say we haven't had our differences.  We had a royal blow-out spat last summer, in fact.  It resulted almost entirely from feeling passionately about our beliefs and holding our work so close to our hearts.  It's like two pretty girls who both really want to be Prom Queen.  I've always wished that I was demure and centered enough to just roll with my 'losses,' smile sweetly, and not take it personally when things don't work out as I plan but I've never been that way.    It's a terrible tightrope to walk, especially when people who love you also love (most of the time) that whole-hearted, passionate, no-holds-barred approach to life that you exhibit.  (As moms around the world have said, "It's all fun until someone loses an eye, and then the crying starts.")  All the more so when two or more of us get all passionate, "shooting from the hip," suffering no fools, emotionally invested and find ourselves at odds.  In those times when I'm being all calm and rational and someone else is in full-on freak out mode, the compassionate caring part of me wants to soothe it and make it better.  Luckily, I know better than to play with that fire, I've learned that lesson from both sides of the argument.  Let it go, let it go, let them vent and calm down and after the raging buzzsaw of raw emotion has subsided, maybe we can all work it out.  Makes me think of  urlLink  The Reverend Horton Heat .   Fire in the hole!

      Full Day  Began with breakfast at Etta's, then off to the Mariner's game.  Beautiful weather!  The game was only a bit over 2 hours (Mariners won) but our seats were in the sun for that whole time.  The stadium temperature sign kept flashing 56 degrees, but it was much much wamer in the sun.  We all left a little pink on our noses and forearms, except for Kate.  I tried so hard to keep from getting a farmer's tan while in Arizona, but blew it today.  I wore my nifty  urlLink WWDN t-shirt  to the game, and have a lovely farmer's tan to show for it.  boo hoo!  After the game we hit  urlLink Wasabi  for happy hour sake and sushi, and then happily toddled off to join Ray, Christine, and John at R&C's place.  Because Kate was along, and being a bit hyper under all the attention, Ray suggested we have a couple cocktails and throw in the  urlLink Josie and the Pussy Cats  movie.  Perfect!  We'd been hoping that Jess and Kathryn would remember to bring along episodes of  urlLink Land of the Lost  from their place, but (memories impared by too many  urlLink Lemon Drops ?) they were forgotten and will have to wait for another day.  Got zero gardening done this afternoon, but managed to fit in plenty of food, fun, and friends.  Here's hoping there'll be a few more precious hours of sunshine tomorrow so the gardening can be finished before the rest of the rainy week begins.

      Fatburger  Got together with friends Charles and Tammie for lunch today.  So very nice to see them!  We used to play  urlLink Ars Magica  together after they moved up here from Los Angeles when Charles took a job at Wizards of the Coast, but as Chris and I started ramping up Green Ronin, we just couldn't make time to play anymore.  Since we stopped playing together, we see much less of them, which is a shame as we always enjoy spending time with them.  We took the opportunity to meet out at a suburban mall that had both a  urlLink Fatburger  and a  urlLink Krispy Kreme  franchise, next door to each other.  I'd never been to Fatburger before, but enjoyed finishing off Kate's uneaten burger.  Their onion rings and chocolate shake also get my highest recommendation.  C&T have been working on the remodel of their house for a while, doing a lot of the work themselves.  They recently finished with all the contractor-related work and are back to doing things themselves, like painting and putting in tile.  I eagerly offered my services as a home improvement assistant if they want/need the help because it would fulfill my urge to have more projects without having to take on an entire renovation myself.   After we parted ways, I took the opportunity to head over to the nearby Home Depot to buy lawn and garden stuff.  I've been itching to get out in my back yard again this year, but every time I've planned to go back there I've either been made a better offer, or the weather has not cooperated.  I thought from the look of things this morning that the weather was going to be rainy again today, but lo, the clouds did part this afternoon and allow me a chance to give the gardening itch a scratch.  We returned home with a station wagon full of potting soil, seedlings and so on.  Kate helped me by randomly pulling up weeds and digging in the dirt for about an hour, but then ran off to pet the neighbor's cat and I didn't see her again.  I worked from 5:30 or so until it got too dark to work, about 8:15.  Cut the grass, pulled up the herbs from the garden and transplanted them into a flower box, planted ornamental greens and flowers along the sunny-fence line, put in a lilac bush, some  urlLink rhubarb , and for the hell of it planted some tulip bulbs (who knows if those will bloom after being neglected on the back porch for months!), weeded and cultivated the vegetable garden patch, etc.  I definitely got a workout!   I was sweating and I can already feel the soreness in my arms and back from all the pulling and digging and mowing.  Felt good, though.  It's a good kind of sore.  I look forward to more gardening this year.  Tomorrow is the Mariners with Jess and Kathryn, after breakfast at Etta's Seafood.  Monday Stan! Is dropping by.  Wednesday, Chris flies to NYC and one of my junior high school friends is coming to town and wants to meet up for lunch or whatnot.  All of a sudden, I'm not only busy at work but having a social schedule as well.  It's fun!

      Oh Poop  Not only have I had the most incredible increase in spam since I started keeping this blog but I recently learned that the people who signed my guest book have also been spammed and that the spammers used my webpage as part of their little spam blurb!  Oooh, that riles me up.  I'm not tricky with the web-building, I don't know a lot of ways to fool spambots or individuals who want to come harvest e-mails from my site.  I'm so bummed.  It's like the hackers who break into little kids' Neopets accounts.  For what?  To prove they can?  To ruin everyone elses fun?  Here's a hint: I don't have a penis, so I don't need it enlarged.  Nor do I need online viagra.  Nor am I looking for your help in refinancing my mortgage, nor will I come to you to repair my credit.  I most especially don't care about F.R.E.A.K.Y W.H.O.R.E.S getting it on with their fathers, brothers, or farm animals.  I will not be visiting your gang bang website, nor willI be looking at jpegs of your "barely legal teens".  I hate you, Spammers!  I hate you with a burning hatred usually reserved for former Brand Managers of Wizards of the Coast or misanthropic stalker/rapists.  I especially hate you for ruining my fun.  All I was trying to do here, you intrusive bastards, was to build an innocuous little community where my friends and colleagues could come hang out and shoot the shit, and maybe find out what I've been up to (since I'm usually so chained to some work- or child-related responsibility, I don't get a chance to actually see my friends and share with them face to face).  Thanks for intruding on my friends, in addition to ruining my fun, you spammer fucks.  I hope you rot!

      Gaming  We actually managed to do a little gaming tonight!  Hooray!  Rick showed up after several weeks of working two jobs.  He's a fun guy to have in the group, but a real boy scout when it comes to things like turning around to go back to do additional work 5 minutes after he left because some other guy had to leave for a  urlLink trip to the emergency room  from eating funky tofu or something.  Kathryn also joined us after skipping out for Tupperware parties and baby showers recently.  It was so much fun to have everyone around we didn't manage to get anything accomplished in the adventure for several hours because we were so busy chatting and cutting up.  I just love our game group, and not just for the gaming!  Tomorrow Chris, Evan and I are meeting with a certain company about a certain potential license.  Could be very cool!  Fingers crossed that it goes well.  Sunday Chris, Kate, Jess, Kathryn and I are going to a  urlLink Mariners game .  It's some sort of kids' day where they're handing out novelty t-shirts to the kids who come to the game, so Kate will be tickled.  Am looking forward to attending the game.  I can hardly believe Chris agreed to come along, but am very grateful he did.  He leaves town for a week starting Wednesday morning, so it will be fun to hang out before he leaves.  Monday  urlLink Stan!  is coming by the house for a little while after lunch.  Aside from game night we don't get too many people dropping by the house, so this should be a treat.  Stan! was telling me about a very cool-sounding bookstore that he recently discovered with another friend of ours, and it made me very much want to visit it.  However, I'm trying to be good and not bring any more books into the house for a while, as I've been on quite the book-buying kick lately.  Lots of books for me to read (or start but never finish) and even more books for Kate in recent weeks.  I always over-buy books for trips I'm taking, out of fear of being bookless while I travel.  I'm reading  urlLink Ginger Pye  aloud to Kate at nights before bed, and it's a very sweet, entertaining, old-fashioned (in the best sense) story that we're both enjoying very much.

      Political parties  Apparently I'm not alone in my disgust and disillusionment with the current political parties.  Well, not that I really thought that I was alone, but I did fear that my reasons for feeling disenfranchised put me in a catagory all by myself and that I might never find a group of people who see the same things the same way I do.  Wil Wheaton has  urlLink a fantastic blog entry  today hitting on the very points that so bother me about the Democrats, right down to the DNC survey that I also recently received.  " To earn my vote, the Democrats need to offer strong, clear, different alternatives to the neoconservative agenda which is currenly driving White House policy. "  Right on, brother!    urlLink Another Wil Wheaton reader  felt sparked by Wil's post to blog his own take on the current state of politics in the US, and why none of the parties available to us are remotely satisfactory. Coming at it from the "other side" this registered Republican manages to still hit on the same pattern of shameful pandering and political unwillingness to tackle certain issues.  " No major party supports a scalable and fair tax system, none are fighting the DMCA, Sonny Bono copyright extensions, and Patriot Act, and none have a workable plan for changing our broken education system. Neither party seems interested in protecting domestic manufacturing jobs, neither feels a rush to stop spam, and no one seems interested in the damaging effects of the current low chinning bar for software and business method patents. "  Again, right on!  I am dissatisfied with the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians all for the same reasons this fellow outlines.  Part of me keeps wondering why, if we can all so clearly see where the political parties fail to meet our needs, why can't we come together somehow?  Why, when we can see the problems is it so hard to come to a solution?  Then I remember everything I've seen happen with the vicious game industry politics ("The politics are so vicious because the stakes are so low.") and how getting even a group of ten thoughtful, experienced people to agree on the management of a game convention or the adjudicating a set of industry awards is an impossible task.  The thought of reliving those experiences on a national scale makes me want to give up the whole thing and move to a cabin in Montana or the Yukon.

      One thing after another  Woke and fed Kate.  Talked to her father on the phone about some school issues. Drove Kate to school.  Stopped at Starbucks for a nonfat latte.  Drove to Renton to check the PO Box. Gave $1 to "homeless" couple on expensive bikes, for which they were blatantly ungrateful (having accosted me outside of the post office and having seen that I also had $10, which I flatly refused to give them).  Told woman I did not have any sanitary pads or tampons on me, sorry.  Drove to  urlLink Costco , lusted over the  urlLink high definition tvs . Bought giant box of  urlLink cheddar cheese Quakes . Drove to Arvey, picked up a great whack of more padded envelopes and cardboard mailers. Returned home, answered e-mail. Made a ham and cheese omlette for lunch, with  urlLink Omega-3 enriched , free-range and organic eggs. Finally cut the grass and weeds in the front yard. Filled a gigantic stack of mail orders.  Tore the house apart looking for the stack of return address labels I'd recently printed.  Found Chris's missing  urlLink Banewarrens  book (so we can actually play on Thursday). Removed the bird's nest that industrious birds built on top of my back porch light (right beside the back door). Put together yet more packages for people who need products of ours for one reason or another.  I'm absolutely worn out, and still have to wash clothes (it's become desperate) and help Kate with her homework.  Several number crunchy projects await my attention, but I have no brain for them tonight.  For now,  urlLink Buffy .

      More headache  Have a headache today.  Very grumpy.  Woke up well, but found a note from Kate's teacher requesting a conference about her behavior.  She's not a bad kid, but she is over-sensitive and dramatic and breaks down in tears over some little thing every single day at school, sometimes multiple times a day.  Her teachers have become very concerned and it's clear that my theory of letting her mature and make friends over this year has not worked.  Made an appointment with her pediatrician for an evaluation.  Not much else I can do until that's out of the way.  Spent the afternoon making oxtail stew, but now that it's finished, Kate doesn't want any and I feel sick from the headache.  Woohoo.  I hope it's good when I have some tomorrow.  Broke up a fight with some neighborhood immigrant teens who were screaming at each other and threatening to start throwing rocks in front of my house.  My rep as the crazy/annoying neighbor lady remains intact. I told them that I didn't care who called whose mama a bitch, they were going to disperse in separate directions or I was calling the police.  They were nearly old enough that my adultness didn't intimidate them, but backed up by the police threat, they finally left. Probably best for my temper that I don't speak whatever language they were screaming in, or I'm sure I would have heard a few choice descriptions of myself as well.  Going to lay down until this headache goes away.

      Movies  Went to see  urlLink A Mighty Wind  yesterday afternoon.  I found it entertaining, and there were times in the theater where the audience was laughing so much that the follow-up lines were missed.  The cast was excellent, but there were several times where I felt the pace didn't quite clip along in the same snappy way as  urlLink Best in Show  (which in turn was criticized for not being as snappy as  urlLink This is Spinal Tap  or  urlLink Waiting for Guffman ).  Quite enjoyable nonetheless, and nice to see such a quirky, non-standard film in such wide release (it was on four screens at the theater I chose yesterday, and playing all over the rest of the city as well).  Grabbed a coffee after the movie and tried to dodge the panhandlers parked in front of every door to every venue and parking garage downtown.  I'm not unsympathetic to the needs of the down and out!  Far from it.  But I am wary of being scammed by people who make a living standing on street corners, and I dislike being hassled for money on the rare occasions that I actually venture out of my house to enjoy the city.   Made good on my threat to call Ray, and sure enough, when we called he was all in favor of our dropping by.  Christine was out with John Tynes at a birthday party/cooking class they'd been invited to, but the menu was quite seafood-heavy and since Mr. Ray is deathly allergic to seafood, he'd had to decline the invite while they went on without him.  Chris and I took him down to The Ave instead, for some nice, safe sausages.  Walked over to  urlLink Scarecrow Video  to find something else fun to watch.  Chris found a Hong Kong flick he'd been hoping to see, but it was Region 3 and our player at home is not one of those new-fangled Multi-Region players, so he gave it a pass.  Ray came away with a delightfully awful vampire movie called  urlLink The Vampire Lovers .  Lesbian vampires, a goofy green-skinned man on a black horse, and Peter Cushing as "General von Spielsdorf" in a kick-ass flowery smoking jacket.  What more could we ask?  It was awful and delicious and I laughed my ass off.    Partway through The Vampire Lovers, John and Christine returned to the house and joined us in the home theater room for a while.  Christine went off to bed before the movie's dramatic conclusion, but John stayed for the whole thing.  Had a single cocktail (Chris was curious about this  urlLink Japanese cocktail  he'd been hearing about, so, ever the gracious host, Ray mixed up a few) and then headed home at a civilized hour in the hope that I'd have energy to mow the lawn this morning.  As morning is nearly over and I'm just now getting around to having coffee, lawn mowing will be waiting until afternoon.

      Cake  Went out for sushi last night with Evan and Rona.  Kate's with her dad, so I have a free weekend.  Sushi was good, up on the north end of Seattle where we never really go.  Lots of spicy rolls, and some spicy scallops that were out of this world.  It was nice to see Evan and Rona socially, haven't seen Rona since the wedding reception. After sushi, they tipped us off to a place that serves a really decadent Medican chocolate cake (complete with fried bananas, caramel sauce, and vanilla ice cream), so we walked over and had coffee and dessert.  We also took the opportunity to look over copies of  urlLink Cartographica , our new full-color map book.  I really hope people like this one, but lately we've been receiving such strange criticisms of our products I'm filled with worry that we're going to see reviews that grade us down on the product because it's not in a spiral binder (of course, if it was in a spiral binder, we'd be graded down for non-standard binding and pages that could possibly tear out) or some such.  It's a beautiful book, meant to serve as inspiration for the GM who needs a location to build an adventure around, or a map of a keep or tower or mine to show players where their adventure is taking place.  Todd Gamble created the entire thing and really went all out.  Still, I want so much for people to respond well (while fearing that they won't) that I'm going to worry about it for the next few weeks until the first reviews are in.  I'm such a freakin' people pleaser at heart, it's tough when your market is the  urlLink Comic Book Guy  from the Simpsons.  Link shamelessly stolen from  urlLink foldedspace.org , where  urlLink JD  talks about CBG's recent career switch: JD's new doctor.   Woke up this morning having slept soundly and about 45 minutes longer than usual.  My head is full of ideas of how I can spend my day.  First on the list is definitely cutting the grass, since it's about 4 inches longer than our Home Owner's Association permits, and growing steadily.  I also have a large bag of potting soil, seeds and bulbs in the back of my car just waiting to be planted.  Waiting since pedicure day, in fact, so it really is about time I got to it.  Would like to slip out to see a movie this weekend as well, but that might be asking too much.  May end up calling Ray and Christine, our traditional "free Saturday" friends, if the roving Mr. Tynes didn't drink them dry last night.  Ah, the endless possibilities for a free Saturday!

      Green Valley  So when we last left off, Kate and I were headed for Tucson.  More specifically, we were headed to  urlLink Green Valley , a little retirement community a bit south of Tucson, and a bit north of  urlLink Nogales  on the Mexican border.  My grandparents have had a summer home in Green Valley for many years now.  I first visited them there when I was about 16.  After my grandmother became ill, they moved to Green Valley year round and sold their Minnesota lake home to my uncle, Jack.  It was wonderful to see my grandpa again.  It had been six years since I last saw him, despite my best attempts to visit with him the last few years.  He's looking good, still healthy and active and very mentally aware.  He's a little skinnier, has a slight tremor and a little more trouble getting out of a chair than he used to, but for an 86-year-old guy he's extremely mobile.  He's a shark at competitive shuffleboard within the retirement community.  He seemed delighted by Kate's antics and spent a lot of time just watching her or listening to her gab with a big grin on his face.  On the other hand, I wouldn't have recognized my grandmother.  She's been confined to full-time care for the last six years.  Her face is drawn, she's lost her ability to move and speak.  She recognizes my Grandpa, who devotedly visits her every day, twice a day, and greets him with a laugh.  The last thing Grandpa heard her say was a some weeks ago while a chipper young nursing aide was fussing with Grandma's hair trying to style it and chatting away to her about how she couldn't get it quite right, Grandma suddenly responded, "Who cares?"  I had to laugh, that's my grandma.  Grandpa speaks fondly of her being a "tough ol' gal" and it's touching and heartbreaking to see them together, him holding her hand or giving her a kiss and saying "See you later, honey."  He brings her a Hershey bar as a treat every afternoon, and has a boxful of Hershey bars in his refrigerator just waiting to be doled out.  My grandpa knows everyone at the nursing facility.  We couldn't walk 10 feet without someone greeting him or him greeting someone: other residents, other family members or friends of residents, staff, volunteers, you name it.  He volunteers with the assisted living residents once a week, and he talks with some of the other lonely residents who have no one else to visit them.  My esteem for him, which was high before, is now nearly indescribable.  If you click  urlLink this link  you will even see an image of him from a few years ago on the official website in the photo montage (that's him in the right-most photo).  I am embarrassed to say that I can't recognize whether the woman in the picture is my grandmother, she has changed so much from how I remember her and has gone through so many stages of change between the woman I grew up with and the woman she is now.  The woman with the balloons, however, is either a relatively recent picture of my grandma, or someone who looks exactly like her.  La Posada is  urlLink a large facility , with assisted living suites, a secure unit for dementia cases, and then a full-service nursing care facility for people like my grandma who are in the last stages of their diseases.  Grandma has been in hospice care for 6 months now, hanging on much longer than anyone thought she would.  When Grandpa first gave in and arranged for her to live at La Posada instead of at home, he thought she'd be able to move to an assisted living apartment.  He left her that evening, unpacking and putting things away, but within a few hours of his leaving, Grandma took off and they found her wandering on the road a couple miles from home.  It was a staff person who had met her that day who noticed her walking on the road and offered her a ride.  When Grandma wouldn't get in the car, this woman stayed with her while her daughter called the sheriff.  Poor Grandpa got a call to come get her that very night.  It was the first time she'd ever wandered (at their home she would stay home while Grandpa went to shuffleboard and so on, no problem) but it meant she had to go into the secure unit instead of assisted living.  They moved her out of the assisted living apartment the next day.  Before she lost her ability to walk, she would wander in and out of the rooms in the secure unit, cleaning and reorganizing everyone's things.  Luckily, the staff attitude was "It's her house, let her clean and we'll put things back in order later."  Grandma was keenly interested in Kate.  She perked up and spent a lot of time watching Kate playing or walking around (as we took Grandma on a stroll around the grounds in her wheelchair).  She was always a very active woman, always cleaning and straightening her house, working in her garden, crocheting,  urlLink tatting , painting, you name it.  It was so hard to see her hands, crippled and clenched.  My aunt Joanne says she thinks Grandma's time is about up.  Even though she's healthy, she's starting to lose weight.  Her body seems to be just slowly giving out.  My family isn't terribly communicative, so until last month I had no idea that my aunt Dolly and Uncle Jack had come down for a month-long visit in March, or that my dad and step-mom had taken a golf trip to Phoenix and come down to visit Grandma a few weeks ago.  My cousin Connie visited with her new baby in October, and I, independently of all of this, scheduled a trip as well.  Joanne sees this as an omen, as if the family has been called back one by one to say our goodbyes.  I'm so glad I made this trip, as heartbreaking as it was at times.  I'm grateful that Kate was able to meet her great-grandma, and see a little of grandpa's devotion to her in her final days.

      Home Again  Arrived home after midnight.  Poor Kate was so sleepy this morning, it was hard to get her up for school.  Will post a recap of Tucson later, but for now, duty calls.  Lots of work to catch up on, especially some very whiny customers who missed the announcement that I was on vacation and are unsympathetically demanding to know why I have been "ignoring" their e-mails.

      Last Days  Yesterday was Kate's last day to have fun with the kids before we head to Tucson this afternoon.  We tried to make a day of it.  We went shopping (because we found we needed a few more hot weather clothes as the temps reached 90 degrees yesterday), went back to the zoo and made a stop at Zoe's school.  We were planning to take the girls bowling, but they started fighting in the car, so we went home for time outs instead.    After her time out, Kate was on her best behavior, hoping we'd reconsider bowling.  Evenutally we decided to go bowling after all, the girls had enough of an attitude adjustment.  We bowled two games and then hauled our tired girls to the grocery store to pick up some things for my favorite black bean and goat cheese quesadillas.  I cooked those up, and made some nachos (Kate complained that I forgot the olives) and plain cheese quesadillas for the girls.  Bought some chocolate truffles to enjoy after dinner, but we went on a golf ball hunt on the darkened golf course instead.  Jim came out and started hitting golf balls around with his baseball bat, while the girls were hoarding all the balls they could find.  Three girls running around with flashlights and screaming eventually attracted the attention of the country club security guard, who tooled out on his little golf cart with high-beam lights to bust us!  Apparently some tightass neighbor complained about us being on the course after dark.  Phooey.  The guard was nice enough.  Said "Ah, a little pre-Easter egg hunting?"  Chided us gently, since Ashley is a resident, and sent us on our way.  The girls collected (and divided evenly between them) 42 golf balls!  I'm secretly leaving our stash of balls in the guest house for Sarah and her family to find when they come to stay next week.    The golf ball hunt was great fun, but we spent so long out on the golf course we ended up putting the girls to bed way after 10:00.  Zoe had to go to school today!  Mad was supposed to go to school too, but she was too out of it, so for the third time during our visit she got to play "Hoo-tey".  (Mad's got the cutest way of speaking.  All of her K sounds come out as Ts, so Kate is Tate, and School is Stool.  Hookey is Hoo-tey. It's made for some interesting translations, but Kate seems to understand her perfectly well.)  Sadly, Kate woke up in the middle of the night.  We've been sleeping in the same bed out in the guesthouse, so I was awakened right away when she woke up and started making gagging sounds.  I said "Honey, do you have to throw up?" and she suddenly sat bolt upright!  Yikes!  I hustled her off the bed and got her as far as the dressing room sink before she puked into it.  I managed to eventually move her over the toilet, but I had quite the mess to clean up.  YUCK.  So gross.  Puking kids has to be one of the worst things about parenthood.  She was crying "Why, why?  I don't want this to happen!" and saying she wanted her Daddy, but when I got her back to bed she fell back asleep right away.  She slept restlessly the rest of the night, and of course every time she moved I bolted awake out of fear of being puked on, but we had no further incidents and she feels fine today.  No idea what that was all about, but I'm hoping it's nothing serious that's going to come back while were on the road or visiting any of my physically frail relatives!    Now it's time for me to hit the road.  Tucson here we come.

      Sedona  Took Kate on a daytrip to  urlLink Sedona, Arizona  yesterday.  The weather was gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky.  The red cliffs and scrubby green trees had the effect of making the sky look like the richest color of blue I'd ever seen.  Absolutely beautiful!  We hiked a short trail, but Kate is so unused to any heat over 79 degrees that she wilted before we even got to the base of the big rock formation I was heading toward.  I ended up taking a scenic drive while she snoozed in the car.  Quote of the hike: "Mommy, I'm *sweating*!  Eww.  It's *wet*."  I swear the kid's never seen sweat, coming from temperate Seattle.  I tricked her into making another stop "on the way home" that wasn't  exactly  on the way.  There was a scenic loop between Phoenix and Sedona that ended at  urlLink Red Rock State Park  and included a little visitor center and a very nice little viewing area.  I would have liked to spend more time out on the trails, but my delicate little flower couldn't take it.  Today we're going to the Phoenix Zoo for a couple of hours and then going bowling with Ashley's girls when they get out of school.  It's our last night at The Compound.  Tomorrow we'll be heading to Tucson to visit my family.  Kate will be so sad!  She's loved living here for the last week with two instant "siblings" to play with.  She is getting along with Zoe and Madeleine so well.  While we were on our day trip she kept saying "I just keep thinking about the kids back home."  She did NOT mean the kids in Seattle, by "home" she meant Ashley's guest house!  Happily, the Phoenix moms and their girls will be coming to the San Diego get together we have planned for July.  It will be like a giant family reunion.

      Survivor  Survived having 10 kids over to The Compound yesterday.  8 girls and 2 boys managed to play nicely together for the most part.  Some of our more introverted kids needed a little more quiet time and space, but there were thankfully few meltdowns or melodramatics.  My worldly daughter was eager to show off Homestarrunner.com to her new friends, who ranged from the girls who watch The Simpsons and Survivor with their parents to those who live a much more sheltered existence, for whom Strong Bad shouting "Holy Crap!" was going to be a big deal.   I figured it was clean enough for the big kids, but unfortunately for me the mom of the more sheltered kids walked in just as Homestar was growling "Hey Crapface," in Kate's favorite episode of Strong Bad E-mail.  ::sigh::  I'll be responsible for therapy bills in the future, I'm sure.  Kate, being born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, keeps begging to go swimming in the outdoor, unheated pool.  To her, we're in the midst of summer here in Phoenix, while the natives are sure to bring sweaters on outings and feel the weather is MUCH too cold to consider swimming.  She's become a much better swimmer in the last year, thanks to swimming with her dad on their visits.  If it were up to me, she probably still wouldn't know how to swim.  I'm not much of a swimmer myself, after a near drowning experience when I was 6 or 7.  Today is another beautiful day, though.  Looking out from my host's computer room I see blue sky and sunshine, palm trees, and green grass over the fence on the nearby golf course.  They have tons of trees around a large, sunny patio directly in back of the house.  Along one side is a grassy play area with a large play structure for the kids.  Along the other side of the house there is a long, narrow stretch of lawn bordered by orange, lemon, and fig trees, all currently with fruit.  Strange desert birds of all sorts flit around the house all day, singing in the trees.  The first night we spent out in the guest house there were birds singing at 2:30 in the morning, but either I'm getting used to it now or they're keeping the racket down, because I haven't heard them in the middle of the night since.  We have been keeping all of our bags and belongings up off the floor out in the guest house, though, since it's the beginning of scorpion season.  Jim found one outside the other day, but I haven't seen any.  Kate was very afraid of seeing any scorps because Animal Planet had her convinced they were deadly poisonous, but the local scorpions are merely unpleasant (like a bee sting) according to our hosts.  That calmed her fears considerably.  Apparently scorpions are not entirely common throughout Phoenix, but Ashley and Jim have them because they migrate through the near-by golf course.  Just on the chance they're keen to make a home in our suitcases or sneakers, we've been keeping everything up high anyway.  It's about time for us to all trek off to the Phoenix Science Center with the Kate and a couple of local Phoenix kids who are playing hooky for the day to spend some time with Kate.  Another fun-filled day on the road.

      Sunburn  My pale, pale Seattle skin isn't adjusting to the bright rays of the Arizona sun.  Even with sunscreen on, I've managed to burn the back of my neck, the tops of my ears (darn short haircut) and my shins.  The back of my neck is the worst, the rest is just a little pink.  But I've got several more days to get burned to a nice crisp if I'm not careful.  So far the kids have been playing together exceptionally well.  Kate and Zoe have hit it off like best friends, although they're both kind of "dramatic" so they've also managed to have a couple of screaming rows (too much sugar, too little sleep).  Have dragged the kids off the the botanical gardens, the Phoenix Zoo, a tye-die event with Lauren's Campfire group, and a swim party. Today Ashley has her two, plus mine, plus a friend's three girls.  Wendy is bringing Lauren and Carli, and Karyl is bringing Adam and Aaron over sometime this afternoon as well.  We're going to be crawling with kids!  A big ol' get-together.  Kate will be thrilled.  So far she's found someone to play Polly Pockets with her, she's been swimming, she's had a "sleep over", and her friend will let her pretend to be a dog in just about every pretend game they play.  Zoe also has a very sweet hamster, Teddy, who Kate is crazy about already.  Ashley also agreed to let the girls make lemonade from scratch, using lemons from the trees in the yard.  (Exactly the kind of thing I always say no to, because I don't want to deal with the mess.) I'm sure she's going to want to have a barbecue with the kids this afternoon.  Hmm, that's a fun idea!  Now to unplug myself from my host's computer and participate in the communal hairwashing going on in the other room (all three girls in the tub together; Ashley's two modest girls are wearing swim suits, while my little nudest in training said "Nah, that's ok, I don't mind," and plunged in naked).

      Leaving on a Jet Plane  Kate and I are nearly ready to go on our Spring Break trip to Arizona.  She is so excited about going she was barely able to sleep last night and woke up at 2:30am wondering if it was morning yet.  This is a grand experiment on my part: Kate and I haven't had a solo holiday together since I grabbed her up and took her by train from Vancouver BC out to a get-together (the first!) with my e-mail mom group, then made a brief stop at GenCon on my way to my parents' place in Minnesota.  She was, oh, just about 8 months old for that trip.  She's a bit bigger now but every bit as fun.  We'll be staying with a friend of mine who has daughters 7 and 5 years old, and visiting other mom-list friends, including the only mom on our list to have lost a child since we've all been together.  Her daughter, Melissa, would also have been 5; she has two living daughters as well, ages 5 and 3-ish.  Her Kate-aged daughter is a child of a much different temperament than her mother, and I've been pleased to be able to give my impressions of what's likely going on in Lauren's head (since I was very much like Lauren when I was her age).  I'll also have a couple of days to spend with my friend Karyl, who is just an amazing woman: working full time, mom to two boys, going to night school to get her degree, and she's lost 40 pounds since last October.    That's the fun part of the trip.  Visiting with The Moms, exploring the wilds of Arizona with Kate and their kids, swimming and sunning ourselves.  Not much not to like about that!  The second half of the trip is more sad for me.  I'm taking this trip primarily because I fear it's going to be one of the last times I will get to see some of my relatives, who are ailing in various ways.  I have not seen my grandmother since 1993.  It was shortly before we found out that she had Alzheimer's, though we'd had our suspicions that something just wasn't right before that.  My grandmother is one tough cookie, though, and fiercely private.  She and grandpa had long since decided to winter in Arizona, and she groused about coming back to Minnesota in her later years.  "It's just a work farm," she'd say, as she cleaned the beach or hung clothes out on the line.  It was no surprise when they eventually decided to live in Arizona fulltime, though I have no doubt that being able to hide grandma's illness through distance had a little something to do with it.  My grandma has long since forgotten that she ever remembered who I was.  I don't exist in her world anymore.  I'm not sure anyone does.  She went through a serious bout of pneumonia last spring that they feared would be the death of her, but even in her diminished state she'd have none of that.  She'll be going out when she's good and ready, thank you very much.  I feared her for much of my childhood, afraid of crossing her and making her stern with me, but it's clear to me now that the same scrappy will to make things "just so" that intimidated he hell out of me as a kid is fundamental to her being.  Even when everything else that made her  her  has eroded, that iron core of her determination remains.  My Grandpa Lindroos, meanwhile, was diagnosed with prostate cancer a couple of years ago.  My dad broke the news to me that Grandpa had decided not to bother with treatment.  I guess he figured at over 80 years old, it was a slow disease that wasn't going to take him before Grandma passed on, so why go through treatment?  I've seen my grandpa a few times since he made the decision to put Grandma into fulltime care.  I know that had to have killed him, they'd been married for over 50 years at that point.  I used to work in a nursing home that specialized in care for residents with dementia conditions (mostly Alzheimer's, but some other conditions as well), and we saw over and over again that families would try to keep their loved ones in the home as long as they could, often far longer than they should have.  My fondest childhood memories revolve around the time I spend with my grandpa, at the lake house he built himself, where he indulged my requests to go fishing or drive the motor boat or "build stuff" with his power tools.  He loved me unconditionally, was patient and understated, and proud of me.  When I "helped" him post some No Hunting signs on his property, he proudly displayed an entire row of my childishly-scrawled "Don't Shoot the Baby Rabbits!!!" signs (complete with animal drawings made with black permanent marker on wood planks) all the way down their winding rural driveway.    I made special plans to bring Kate and Chris up to Ely last summer, to coincide with my grandpa's scheduled visit to his old house (which now belongs to Uncle Jack and Aunt Dolly), but then Grandma had her scary bout with pneumonia, and everyone thought she could go at any moment.  Grandpa certainly didn't want to take two weeks to go to Minnesota if Grandma was at risk of dying while he was gone!  Under the current circumstances, I don't know when he might make another trip "home" and goodness knows if I would be able to arrange to be there at the same time.  So, I've scheduled a trip to see him in Arizona instead.  I'm quite a bit frightened by what I might see when I get there.  I deeply love my grandparents and they were undeniably influential in shaping who I've grown up to be.  The feeling I have about them now, in their current circumstances, is tenderness and timidity.  I feel like I'm watching the beautiful bubble of their lives, full, shimmering, increasingly transparent and in danger of popping out of existence at any moment.  I've never known anything like it before in my life.

      Neat!   urlLink JD  reports that  urlLink ComicsOne  will be publishing a series of graphic novels based on the Courching Tiger, Hidden Dragon novel.  Sweet!  Sounds like it's definitely a good time for Chris to be working on the revamp of  urlLink DragonFist .  Stupid stupid Wizards of the Coast squandered the potential of Chris's game the first time around (just one of the hundred reasons I'll never forgive certain key people), and I can't wait until we're able to give his game the full treatment it has so long deserved.

      I Win!  After about 2 minutes in the Mitigation courtroom, the judge had ruled in my favor on the "unlicensed vehicle" issue and additionally knocked the parking fine down from $25 to $5.  I'd been willing to pay for my mistake on the parking issue, but I wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth either.  Yay!  Far less painful than I feared it would be.  The judge clearly didn't want to hear a bunch of whining (and after hearing about 30 seconds of the story the guy before me was telling, I couldn't blame him!  I was sick of it after mere moments.  That job would drive me batty).  On the other hand, my visit to the Post Office was far *more* painful than I thought it would be.  I wasted a good 35 minutes there, standing in line and listening to the somewhat unnerving Mumbly Guy who sometimes works the counter mumble to himself while he worked over my thirty-odd mail order packages.  He's never been anything but nice when I 've seen him, but man, he still gives me the creeps.    While in line, people behind me were complaining about the wait and the slow service.  "If this were privatized, the line would be moving faster," I heard one woman grouse to someone.  Am I the only person left in the world who doesn't think privatization and deregulation are the cure for everything?  Sure, the line might move faster, but I have no doubt the service would plummet and the cost would sky-rocket.  Profit-conscious investors would constantly be under pressure to net more and there are very few ways to do that: pay the workers less and charge the customer more are two of the most popular.  No thanks.

      DUI  M. was arrested for drunk driving.  She's not a dumb woman, but she keeps doing dumb things.  This isn't the first time, but I really, really hope it will be the last.  M. is important to me and I fear what will happen to her if she doesn't straighten things out.  I hate to write about it, because I don't want to add to the trouble she's having.  I care about M. and on one hand I'm mad at her for letting this happen.  On the other hand, I can't deny any longer that she's got a serious drinking problem. I've joked before about functional alcoholics, those who drink to excess, but who don't harm anyone or endanger others by driving or miss work because of their drinking.  Getting arrested for DUI (more than once!) is not "functional."   She's definitely going to lose her driver's license for this infraction.  I would hope the courts would have her attend AA or some other alcohol treatment, but it didn't seem to do any lasting good the other time, if they did. I fear she might spend time in jail.  Since she's always on the brink of financial disaster at the best of times, I worry about what spending time in jail would mean for her job, her financial situation, her ability to live...  It's terribly depressing for me to contemplate.  Most grim, in my mind, is that her companion is an enabler of the worst sort.  M. needs to stay out of bars, not keep alcohol in the house, not surround herself with people who drink, routinely and to excess.  Her companion does not support those efforts.  Without that kind of commitment and the support of her partner, I don't see how M. can avoid the downward spiral of repeat offenses and self-destructive, addictive behavior.  She's occasionally turned to me for help in these situations.  I've tried to be supportive without being enabling.  It's difficult.  I don't feel equipped for this.

      WedCon is ON!  Ever since my barely-post-September-11 wedding, I've been talking about having a West Coast Reception.  We've lovingly dubbed this reception WedCon, part wedding reception, part gaming convention.  It's taken us two years to get things properly organized, but I'm pleased to say that as of now, WedCon I is on the schedule. If people come and have fun, there could certainly be WedCon II or WedCon III in the future.  I put the deposit on the New Holly gathering hall today.  Finally, I'll get to cater my own reception.  I'm beside myself.  What fun.   Chris is pleased, I'm sure, because we'll have a captive audience for games for at least the 5 hours that we have the hall.  We may decide to have the party go on at our house into the following day, haven't decided the details yet.  It's nice to have something fun and personal to look forward to, since so much of my attention is sucked up by the upcoming convention season and concerns for the business.

      Violence  I remember the completely sick feeling that I had the first time I heard people talk about the evil things that people do to each other.  I do not remember what in particular was being discussed.  It definitely wasn't something I was meant to hear.  Most likely, I was lingering around the edges of adult conversation somtime in the early 70s, when the Vietnam war and the horrors committed there were still fresh and raw.  The specifics don't matter, the shock, disgust, and utter disbelief I felt have blotted everything else out.  It had never occured to me that people would hurt each other on purpose, that they would set out to hurt each other, that they wouldn't be seized by grief or regret for their actions.  I was young enough that I'm sure I couldn't have even put these visceral feelings into words.  Tonight, the History Channel has graphic stories and footage about Saddam Hussein and his sons.  Evil, evil, and more evil.  Even after all these years, after I've learned about ancient human sacrifices, the Holocost, female genital mutilation, the rape of Nanking, two small boys left to starve to death in a basement, on and endlessly on... even after all of this, I'm still sickened, still physically disgusted by the torture and mistreatment of innocent people I don't even know.  Is it so impossible to just leave each other alone?  Why is peace and respect so impossible?

      Worn out  Saturday I spent the day wrestling with a loft bed in Kate's room.  I made a hellish trip to IKEA, which turned out to be in the midst of some gigantic sale. The place was a zoo, with kids running amok all over the place, and mall-walking zombies standing or shuffling in the middle of every conceivable walking space.  I can spend hours strolling IKEA getting ideas for projects on the right day, but Saturday was not that day.  I curse every one of those  urlLink shambling mounds  who thought it was a good idea to wander the crowded aisles aimlessly with their ill-mannered offspring.  After getting off to that great start, I then spent the afternoon struggling to move a couple of 100 pound packages from the car to Kate's upstairs room alone. I ended up doing it in stages which had me dragging the boxes from the car to the porch, then breaking each package into its component parts on the porch and moving the pieces inside and upstairs.  It was quite a work out!  Spent about 3 hours sweating and wrestling with pieces of loft bed, then cleaned up and ran off to join folks at Ray and Christine's for a barbecue.  Ray mixed up some excellent  urlLink mojitos  using this gigantic bunch of fresh mint I'd picked up from the Columbia City farmer's market last week.  Yummy!    Christine cooked up some great burgers, grilled asparagus, grilled corn on the cob (one of my favorites!), garnished the whole thing with two different kinds of potato salad, and opened up several bottles of wine.  Very nice way to spend a Kate-free weekend and kick off the official "summer season."  Of course, I hit the wall as I often do at R&C's and had to excuse myself for a lie-down at midnight or so, in the middle of watching the Mystery Science Theatre 3000  urlLink Angels Revenge  episode. I told Chris to wake me when he was ready to go, but as it turned out, I woke up on my own around 2:30am.  Chris, Ray and the esteemed  urlLink Mr. Tynes  were having a vigorous discussion about game properties and game design. Managed to crawl wearily into the car sometime around 3:30am and drove home only to find myself completely awake and alert after the brisk drive in the cool morning.  I tinkered on the loft bed for a short while, then noodled around on the internet until I finally felt sleepy again, somewhere around 4:45am.  Unfortunately for me, I'd forgotten to set my clock.  I have a great alarm clock that I can set to automatically turn off on the weekends, and start ringing again automatically during the week.  This is a fantastic feature, until you have a long weekend where you stay up until almost 5am on a Monday morning.  Argh!  Was jolted unpleasantly awake at my usual 7:45am, then fell exhaustedly back to sleep only to be rudely awoken again by a recorded message from Citibank somewhere around 8:30am.  It was not long after that I just gave up, got out of bed, and went back to finishing the loft bed.    I'm quite proud of my handiwork.  I managed to get the bed erected, move Kate's computer desk and associated electronics across the room, get everything working, move and restock her bookshelves, and generally make the room livable again as a solo project.  The unfortunate part was that I had to drive to Canby and back to pick Kate up from my mom's after all of this!  Chris came with me to keep me company and help make sure I didn't get drowsy on the road (which, thanks to his engaging conversation, I did not).  After picking Kate up at my mom's, I tooled around Canby with the family, goggling at the massive development that's sprung up on "the other side of town" near my old junior high.  What I remember as farm fields has turned solidly into suburbia.  I took the opportunity to drive by   urlLink  the "new" elementary school  and gave my pal JD a call, figuring we'd pay him a quick visit since he was laid up on the couch after knee surgery.  We stormed his house in the middle of dinner, while he and wife Kris were already entertaining the Gingeriches.  Kate played with the Gingerich kids while JD gamely hobbled up onto his crutches and gave us a tour of the house, specifically his game closet and library. We couldn't stay too long, as I had a 3+ hour drive ahead of me, but still it was great to see JD in person after having spent the last 15 years or so in touch only through mutual friends, or recently, through e-mail and weblogs.  Made it home safe and sound, but am still feeling the effects of my sleepless weekend.

      Man from my past  Browsing weblogs through links at  urlLink Foldedspace.org , I happened across a link for an elementary school in my former hometown.  I'd never heard of this school, so, curious, I clicked around for more information and what do you know: the principle of this elementary school is the same, hateful Vice-Principle who helped make my life a living hell when I was in 7th and 8th grade, at the recently mentioned  urlLink Ackerman Junior High .  Mike Zagyva.  The name still makes me feel vaguely sick to my stomach.

      Off to Oregon  My mom called last night to remind me that she wanted to take Kate camping this weekend.  Doh!  I'd totally forgotten!  So, I'm packing Kate up and hauling her off to Grandma's house.  Another missed day of school, but I figure if Kate can't have fun experiences with her family now, when will she be able to?  I suppose the fact that I'm not at all thrilled with her current school makes me a little passive-aggressive, too.  Not sending my kid there to be bullied and told she's a crybaby when I could be sending her off for some TLC with grandma.  Nothing like 8 hours of driving to start the weekend off right.

      Why I love my husband.  We're made for each other.  I've known that for years now, but it's nice to have it restated.  Today's example: my favorite Dude and his lovely lady are newly pregnant and expecting a baby, what seems mere weeks after their wedding (which actually took place back in February).  Evan broke the news that I'm to be a surrogate auntie, and my smart-assed first response was "You guys don't waste any time, do you!" I called Chris down from his office, under the false pretense that he should be host-like since we had a guest, but it was really to give Evan the opening to announce his impending fatherhood to my dearly beloved.  Chris's first shocked response?  "Wow, you guys don't mess around!"  For something like 6 years now, Chris has been able to finish my sentences, and I've been able to finish his.  When we were no more than pen pals, living on opposite coasts, we could anticipate what the other was about to say, and had several Instant Messenger conversations on AOL where we're both type the same comment to each other, at the same moment.  It's completely natural, unscripted.  It just happens. It's one of the coolest things about my marriage.  And I'm all jolly and happy to hear Evan and Rona's good news!  If I can't have another baby of my own, having a surrogate niece or nephew to dote on is just fine by me.

      My Friend  urlLink J.D.   I have no clear memory of meeting JD.  I moved around enough as a kid that I'm able to narrow it down to a specific window of opportunity, but I have no recollection of a moment when we met and I became aware of him as a person, or took note of his place in my universe.  It may very well have been when I was a Freshman at  urlLink Canby Union High School  , probably involving the speech team or the school literary magazine, Patina.  JD was a grade ahead of me, so while I might have known of him in a general way when I was in the 7th grade at Ackerman Junior High (now  urlLink  Ackerman Middle School ) I didn't know him personally that far back.  I moved to Canby the summer after I graduated 6th grade at a grade school in nearby Oregon City.  The only things of note that came from Oregon City are Tonya Harding and the unfortunate murders of two young girls at an apartment complex very near one of the houses my family rented back in the day.  Oregon City was on a traditional school year system, with 9 months on and about 3 months off during the summer.  I moved to Canby just before I would have had to attend classes at Moss Junior High, where a group of older, tougher girls had already warned me I was "dead meat" as soon as I showed my face.   Canby was on this wacky year-round "track" system, the first time I had ever encountered such a thing.  Kids attended K-4 in one school building, then moved to another school for grades 5-6, all classes running on one of three "tracks" that were a few weeks on, then a week or two off, throughout the school year.  I'd never heard of such a thing, but it did mean that when we were all thrown together into the junior high for grades 7-8, there were plenty of kids who didn't know each other because they'd been on different tracks or what have you.  For grades 7-8 and then through all high school, the school year ran on the same traditional system I was used to.  During my years in Canby, I was attending  urlLink Canby Christian Church  and active in their youth group.  JD had been raised Mennonite, but at the time I met him he was loosening his religious views.  I dragged him off to some youth group rally or other once, where  he later admitted to me that the evangelical bent of the evening hadn't meshed well with his "conservative Mennonite views" (a phrase I remember him using, mostly because I was having trouble understanding for myself what it meant to have "conservative Mennonite views").  We have both since completely moved away from that sort of religious lifestyle, but there was definitely a time when my life revolved around getting to Sunday school on time and being allowed to go to the next  urlLink Petra  concert.  I can still sing the chorus of Not By Sight.  JD was one of the people from that time with whom I felt comfortable with when it came to having heartfelt talks about the mysteries of a person's spiritual life and developing code of morals and ethics.  JD and I, along with another friend, Mitch Sherrard, wrote like fiends and exchanged poetry on a regular basis.  JD was the best poetic talent of the three of us, with a best vocabulary and the willingness to try out many different poetic styles.  I remember him as alternately serious and almost pretentious about writing as a craft and his writing in particular on one hand, and a sweetly tender, goofy, girl-crazy boy brimming over with affection for the world.  Mitch was like JD's dark counter-part in our trio.  Mitch's father had died before we became friends, and Mitch was struggling with many of the typical dark issues of teenhood: alienation, loneliness, feelings of uncertainty and loss.  Mitch's poetry was often dark, brooding, cynical, and then surprisingly sensitive and vulnerable when you'd least expect it.    My poetry was the rawest of the three, which I attribute to my relative youth and utter lack of life experience.  I was always cooking up some melodramatic, angsty, thing and always shot to include a "message" or overt moral statement.  Oh how I cringe looking over some of those masterpieces of modern teen poetry.  I have a wonderful photo of the two of them clowning for the camera outside the High School sometime in the winter of the '84-'85 school year (or so I assume because of the visible patches of snow).  Aside from yearbook photos, it may be the only remaining snapshot I have of either of them.  JD and I have reconnected over the last few months, thanks to the blessed wonder of the Internet.  I visit his blog regularly and he has been kind enough to visit and comment at mine as well.  It's been fantastic to see how JD, the boy I knew, has become JD, the familiar-yet-different man.  Wonderful wonderful technology that allows us to reconnect after so long, and across so many hundreds of miles.  JD is having knee surgery tomorrow (technically today, I suppose).  It's a bit more serious than the typical, minor, orthoscopic surgery and he has dibs on all my best, most healing thoughts until he recovers.  I'd appreciate it if the rest of you who swing by Nikchick.com could keep him in your thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery as well.

      Productive day today.  Announced the formation of our demo teams, and got a fantastic response off the bat.  So far applicants are nicely spread out across most of the country, except for a surprising concentration of people from different parts of Idaho.  Didn't expect that.  I have information that I'm prepared to circulate, including our expected code of conduct, official "demo" policies and a volunteer agreement for people to sign.  Back in 1998 when I launched the  urlLink Demo Monkey  program for Cheapass Games, things were so much simpler!  In the old days I would have been much more casual about everything, but these days the government is involved and demands that we have official agreements in place, codes of conduct laid out, the whole bit.    Evan put a lot of work in fine tuning some data collection forms for demo applicants and convention support requests.  We're also going to have an Events calendar at the website so people can keep track of when and where our demo teams are going to be running games.  Just in time, too, because the convention season is essentially upon us!  The websites are looking better all the time and I really get the feeling that people are building a real community around our games and support.  My next order of business it to catch up on the data entry for our mailing lists, and to get cracking on creating promo items in time to provide support for all my new-found minions.  The half-implemented webstore is also hanging out there in the ether, and I really need to finish that up before we start the convention circuit, too.  It seems everything in my life is measured around holidays, book releases, and conventions!  Managed to get a home-cooked dinner into the family tonight on top of everything else:  urlLink honey-lime baked chicken wings ,  urlLink Deborah Madison's  lemon-dill fava bean salad (fava beans are a hellacious amount of work to prep, with the shucking and the blanching and then removing a second layer of shell before finally having an astoundingly small pile of beans ready for cooking, but they are delicious and I buy them at the farmer's market whenever I can get them fresh) and some homemade peach-strawberry pie that I baked yesterday.  Kate even ate a chicken wing, supplemented with a bowl of grated cheddar cheese.  It's a freakin' miracle when this girl eats any of my home cooking.  She "sorta liked" the chicken, but told me the "goopy stuff" (that would be the dressing) was "funny" and the beans "didn't taste like anything."  I told her what she meant to say was the  dressing  was "tangy" and the fava beans were  "subtle" .  In an effort to appease me, she did say that she liked the cheese (which was, of course, her independent addition to the menu).  ::sigh::

      No answers  Argh.  Still no idea what to do about the display situation.  Furthermore, I updated some software on  urlLink my Palm  tonight and now the damn thing is in an endless loop of Fatal errors and worthless resets.  I updated the software because not to long ago the Mac was crashing and I tried to solve the issue by defragging the hard drive.  The defrag wouldn't complete, and then when I went to start up my mail program, it wouldn't start up either until I removed all my user info and saved mail from the file.  Happily, I'd backed up my date book, address book, and everything except the mail messages themselves, so I wasn't too terribly screwed, but when I was reinstalling from those back-ups I noticed that several things from my Palm were not backed up correctly.  I spent something like six hours reinstalling, downloading, upgrading, and so on to get my Palm in prime working order, except for one notice that said I needed to download the latest version of some software or other.  When I did that, the above-mentioned Fatal Error loop began!  Lame.  And frustrating.  Of course one of the things I did lose with this defrag-inspired crash was a folder of requests for convention support that I had not backed up.  And wouldn't you know it, tonight a guy comes out on the internet bitching about what bad manners I have for not getting back to him about his convention support request.  I honestly don't ever remember getting anything from this guy, none of the details of his request sound at all familiar... but of course I can't look in my convention requests folder to be sure.    I shouldn't worry, I suppose, but I do. I want so badly to please people, to put out products that they love and deeply enjoy, to give them that extra bit of attention that makes them happy.  Every time I fail to do that it just eats at me.  When someone, for example, hates a picture in one of our books and feels the need to harp on it in public, at the slightest opportunity like it's some personal vendetta, it eats at me.  When someone who *knows* there are only three of us working fulltime at Green Ronin complains about what a rotton, rude, horrible person I am for not answering his e-mail (that I can't even say for certain I received), it eats at me.  I wish I didn't take the criticism of virtually anonymous strangers to heart, but I always have and judging from my response to tonight's latest round of dismissive rantings, I clearly still do.  What can I say?  I'm sorry, I suck.

      Puzzle of the Day  Figuring out the most cost-effective way to get our convention display from San Diego Comic Con (ending Sunday, July 20th) to GenCon Indy (set-up begins Wednesday, July 23rd).  Getting ourselves to both conventions is tricky enough (since I must stop back in Seattle and drop off Kate, who is going to San Diego with us but not Indianapolis) but I'd definitely prefer not to spend $2000 2-Day Air shipping 100 pounds of convention display before leaving town.  Will be sure to update on my brilliant solution as soon as I have one.

      Johnny Cash  I have the most wonderful childhood memories of listening to the music of my parents and grandparents.  I realize that most of it is not considered much, if it is considered at all, these days.  Kids today are not rushing out to ensure their CD collections include the greatest hits of  urlLink Credence Clearwater Revival , or the two-record set of  urlLink Jesus Christ Superstar .  No one is impressed that I know all the lyrics to Johnny Horton's version of  urlLink The Battle of New Orleans , but I could belt it out with the best of them when I was 7.  My family's musical tastes could be described as eclectic.   urlLink Bing Crosby ? Check.  urlLink Joan Baez ? Check. The Amazing  urlLink Wilson Picket ? Check. There are a few artists in my childhood repertoire that were undeniable masters, The Beatles, Elvis, and (one of my favorites)  urlLink Johnny Cash .  Cash's beloved wife, June Carter Cash, died last week from complications following heart surgery.  In the 2002 liner notes from his current hot album,  urlLink CASH  he wrote,  "I am persuaded that nothing can separate me from the love of my God, my wife and my music.  Life is rich when I can come home, after hours in the studio, feeling as frayed as a hundred Big G strings, and curl up to June Carter.  She's a soft, fluffy Mama Bear. That's when I give God a 'Thanks a lot, Chief.' "  Combined with her haunting appearance in his video for his cover of NIN's Hurt, the depth of his love for her is clear.  I feel so sad for our tough and tender Man in Black.  I'm sure I can't imagine the grief of such a loss.  I've been slowly introducing Kate to the eclectic variety of my musical tastes.  She is trying valiantly to learn all the lyrics to  urlLink A Boy Named Sue , she requests to listen to both the Beatles, and Elvis, and she sings along to "Down to the River to Pray" from the  urlLink O Brother Where Art Thou Soundtrack  with the same blissful enjoyment as she enjoys when she sings along to the latest from Britney Spears or whatever other hollow pop dance track is popular with the kids these days.  This is one family tradition I'm pleased to carry on.

      Back!  Whew, that was quite the whirlwind tour.  I'm SO glad to be back home.   urlLink JD asked  in the comments recently about the travel and networking required for running our business.  I have to say that I usually enjoy the travel and attending the conventions.  Having been in the same line of work since I left high school has meant that I've met many dozens of other game industry regulars who have, over the years, become some of my best friends.  The internet allows us to keep in touch, even though we usually don't get to see each other in person for more than a few hours at a time, two or three times a year.    On the other hand, the turn-over in the game industry is tremendous.  People leave the business on a regular basis, going off to more stable or lucrative jobs as game systems and companies rise and fall in and out of popularity.  Sometimes the companies come in with a spectacular splash: sponsoring banquets, offering golden contracts, throwing parties with ice sculptures and live bands, renting riverboats or hotel ballrooms.  Sometimes they go out in a similarly spectacular manner: they blow the money for their new fax machine on a dinner for their staff and volunteers at a highbrow German eatery, they spent the money for the print run of the new book on ice sculptures and hired models to hang out in their booth, they have stiffed so many printers/artists/writers they can't hire anyone to print/draw/write their products anymore.  Countless people have come on the scene with their "better" versions of D&D or their take on Magic: the Gathering, dozens of perfectly nice men and women have mortgaged their houses thinking that the world really needed another game magazine.  I miss many of those people and wonder what they're up to these days.  If one is not actively "in" the game business, one is very much out.  Having now been to E3 in person, I have to say I hope never to have a job that would require me to attend on anything like a regular basis.  Just being there for one day was far more than I could stand!  The lights in all the halls are dimmed so that no glare on the computer screens will distract people from whatever cool, new graphic effect your company is introducing to the world.  Giant, flashing, booming displays thirty feet tall loom in each of the three gigantic exhibit halls, where people line up to have a chance to play a few minutes of your as-yet-unreleased game (or crowd around to watch some other lucky fellow have his turn).  The noise is tremendous and assaults convention attendees from all sides.  Each exhibitor wants to attract your attention and draw you to his booth, but not only that!  They do not want you to be distracted by other exhibitors' game noises or promotional hooha, so when you enter the circle of their exhibit space you're assaulted by a wall of sound that miraculously blocks out all others around you until you somehow wander out of the range of the noise and into the range of the next booth's soundblast.  Having a conversation with someone on the floor of E3 is like trying to shout out anything meaningful to someone standing right in front of the amps at a rock concert.  I have no doubt that serious hearing damage took place at that show, and I feel no compulsion to put myself through that even once more.    I'm pretty wiped out, so I guess I'll wrap this up and get some shut eye for now.

      Small victory, the competitor I mentioned recently has agreed to remove half of our company name from his site, but maintains he has the right to use the other half because of its "historical significance".  Whatever.  As annoyed as I am, he's reaping what he deserves, and if he wants to corner the market selling to pedophile gamers, he can go right along doing that and hopefully he'll be leaving me out of it from this point on.  Ug.  Taking our flight down to LA tomorrow, conducting business meetings and so forth at E3.  Am leaving Kate in the capable hands of Uncle Jess for the weekend.  Jess has been an excellent friend, stepping up at the last minute to shuttle Kate back and forth to school and hanging with her while we're gone.  Kate adores Jess and Kathryn, they're like the extended family, the aunt and uncle she doesn't have (at least not near by).  Still, it's no small undertaking to agree to keep Kate for two and a half days straight.  On a scale of one to Awesome, they're super-great.  In order to try and keep this unexpected trip from costing too much, we booked the whole thing through Priceline, which has up arriving something like 24 hours in advance of our meeting, and leaving late the day after!  If all goes well, we'll be able to hook up with some other people at E3 who might be in the mood to make deals with little ol' us.  If not, the meetings we have scheduled are plenty fine all on their own.  In addition to the scheduled meetings, I have hopes of seeing other industry folks that we know.  It's possible The Bish will be there, and we just could run into him if he is (that would be swell, we haven't seen Bishop since he took  a job in Edmonton  and moved away with barely a fond, drunken farewell).  Friend, and fellow  urlLink Atlas Games  alum,  urlLink Jeff Tidball  is currently living in LA, having finished his stint at film school.  He's now working on the  urlLink Lord of the Rings  property at Decipher, and if we don't manage to hook up with him on this jaunt, we expect we will be seeing him at either Origins or GenCon later this summer.  Most pleasantly exciting of all, for me, is that LA is relatively near Palm Springs.  One of my oldest, very dearest friends, with whom I've only been in sporadic contact with in the last eight or nine years, is a reporter for  urlLink The Desert Sun  in Palm Springs.  It's been, oh, nearly 10 years since we've seen each other in person, and since we're getting in so god-awful early I should have no trouble at all making the drive out to Palm Springs for some face-to-face reconnecting.  I'm absolutely thrilled, especially because I have so few close friends from childhood that I still have any connection to.    Must pack, so I can get Kate bundled off and packed up to Jess's by 5:30am.  Cursed early-morning flights!

      FOUL  Found out today that a competitor (and I use that term in the loosest sense, as this company is run by a bottom-feeder who is not in our league in his wildest dreams) is using the names of our company and some of our better known products, jumbled up with words stripped from every game or media company/property of note, including (but not limited to) Hasbro, White Wolf, Steve Jackson Games, AOL, Fox, Paramount, Marvel Comics, DC Comics... as Meta-Tags for his site(s).  That's sleazy enough, but included in this list are all sorts of search words like "sex pedo nude girls" and  "cheerleader little russia illegal cock hard big tits" and "sucked lolita lolitas pimps" and "bondage date rape black angels" or my personal favorites "card games multi player cum spit farm animals dogs" and "barely legal pre teen young adult film movies mpeg exploitation money back guarantee daddy incest daughter gays gang bang..."  It goes on, but you definitely get the point.  Makes me sick and angry to think that someone looking for our products in a search engine would type in our company name or some other generic game terms and end up at "Prison Bitch: the card game" instead.  You want to enjoy the great wide world of free commerce?  Go right ahead.  More power to you!  But leave my products, my company identity, my trademarks and brand names out of it!  Why is it so hard for some people to leave others in peace?

      Beautiful Mother's Day  The weather was just lovely yesterday.  Kate, Chris, and I joined Charles and Tammie for brunch (and to hand off the money we owed them for sales of Charles' excellent  urlLink Ultramodern Firearms  D20 book).  My present to myself was to drop Kate and Chris off at home and then go out shopping by myself for several hours.  We needed a few office supplies, and talking with Charles and Tammie has spurred me to go out and get a replacement for our terribly unreliable cordless phone.  I also stopped at  urlLink Cost Plus World Market  and picked up some goodies like a  urlLink Bodum Iced Tea Brewer  for $9.99.  Score!  Treated myself to a couple off counted cross-stitch kits and miscellaneous items at the  urlLink Michael's  next door.

Now he's barely returned from that junket and we're jaunting off to Los Angeles for the famed  urlLink E3-Electronic Entertainment Expo , to meet with a couple of folks who happen to be going.  Down on Thursday morning, back on Saturday night, and I arranged the whole thing for about $450 (including flights, car rental, and hotel) thanks to  urlLink Priceline.com .  Booya.  Kate has only 6 weeks left of school, and as soon as school lets out we're going to be drowning in convention season.  I can feel the panic setting in.

      X2, redux  Chris, Kate and I went to see X-Men United together last night.  Chris and I had seen the movie separately on opening weekend, but it seemed like the kind of thing we could enjoy with Kate as well, so we gave it a shot.  Kate loved it, except for the mushy kissing (and, she noted, the Wolverine she knows from the cartoon would   never   cry).  She was sharp-eyed and caught the shadowy phoenix at the end.  The general lack of blood from Wolverine's  snikt, snikt  action was definitely a plus for this family's entertainment.  Seeing the movie again reaffirmed my preferred theory about why Jean goes out at the end in the way that she does.  The one criticism I've heard several of my friends voice about the ending is they can't understand why Jean left the plane and sacrificed herself.  My theory on that was that from the beginning they tried to establish that Jean was having these uncontrollable surges of power: at the museum she starts overhearing the thoughts of everyone in the room, becoming "overloaded" and causing the tv screens in the room to start malfunctioning; Cyclops tells us that she's been having nightmares that "make the whole room shake"; when she tries looking into Nightcrawler's mind, it gets too intense and she has to break contact suddenly (she apologizes to Nightcrawler); when fighting against the mind-controlled Cyclops, she damn near releases a nuclear explosion (and since she's fighting against her lover, we assume she doesn't want to kill him or blow the whole place up...subduing him ought to have been enough, but she "surged" with power again).  But the time they get to the jet, and it's inexplicably shut down, Jean understands that she's the one causing the problem, through powers she can't control.  She leaves the jet in order to make sure everyone else gets away, and (knowing Cyclops will insist on trying rescue her, or waste precious time trying to convince her she's wrong) she takes matters into her own hands, blocks their efforts, and sacrifices herself.  Seeing it the second time really let me pick up that thread during the story.  I was surprised that I saw that thread in the movie where so many of my comic-geek friends did not!  Maybe it's a chick-thing?  Kate, after the final voice-over, said, "Oh, I totally thought she was going to come back."  She will, sweetie, you just wait for X-men 3.  For now, let's just start the count-down to the next ding dang Harry Potter novel.

      Like the rock stars do it  Take a couple of  urlLink Canadian geek-rock superstars , put them up in the  urlLink Excalibur Hotel and Casino  in Las Vegas, and see what happens:    "...speaking Olde English to the staff is fun. “Good Morrow young valet peasant. Woudst though pointith us to thine check in and registry? Forseuth, I must retreatith to mine room a mile leeward, and layeth mine heater". We were the only ones laughing. I'm still laughing.    Having stayed at the Excalibur once shortly before the  urlLink GAMA Trade Show  moved off the strip to  urlLink the Orleans Hotel and Casino  (replete with headliners like  urlLink Neil Sedaka  and  urlLink Bobby Rydell ) I can attest that the Excalibur has restaurants with names like Lance-A-Lotta Pasta! or Sir Galahad's Pub & Prime Rib House, and absolutely deserve to have people spouting their best Renaissance Faire Olde English during their visits.

      I have been in a cooking and cleaning way today.  Having done umpteen loads of laundry and a spate of gardening today, I feel very virtuous.  I also managed to find some nifty, simple  urlLink IKEA  shelves for this awkward little corner of my kitchen that was going to waste.  Every time I manage to put up one shelf or organize a corner of the house, I always feel a surge of happiness.  Too many potential projects, too little time and money, alas.    I did finally plant the last of my spring plant purchases, though I might go out for a few more flowers or small bushes for the front, as it's currently too asymetrical out there to suit  me.  I'd dearly love to buy a  urlLink Japanese maple  to plant in front of the house near the border of my yard with the small park next door, but I haven't quite decided to go all the way and dig up that part of our very small yard.  I'm very fond of the look of the Japanese maple, though, and would love to have one in the yard somewhere.  I've already fulfilled my desire to plant a couple of lilac bushes and some lavender in the back, the Japanese maple is still calling to me.   If I'm really ambitious on the weekend, I'll finally finish properly setting the bricks/paving stones in the back walkway, replacing once and for all the gravel patch between the porch steps and sidewalk to the garage/alley.  It's bothered me since we moved in to have that ugly, dirty gravel path, and most of my neighbors have long ago repaved their gravel patches, but I've just never gotten around to doing it correctly.  In order to acheive the look I want, I need to dig up/remove all the gravel, lay down some special sheeting (to keep weeds from growing up between the bricks), level the whole thing, tamp it down, put down a layer of sand, tamp that down level as well, and then set all the bricks/stones in place.  I've got half the stones I need, and haven't quite settled on the way I'd like to finish the whole project.  Definitely want to have it completed in time to spend some time in the back yard this summer.  Have decided to try and book a room at  urlLink The Capitol Club  for Chris's birthday this summer.  It seems up his alley, and I think it would be fun and classy to celebrate there.  No confirmation that I can get it for the date I requested, but I'm hoping that in this economy it's not as difficult to book as places like this used to be 5-6 years ago.    Made some excellent pulled pork sandwiches for game night, as well as a new recipe for a cactus salad that I quite enjoyed.  Both from the  urlLink Joy of Cooking , a book that has proved to be a life-saver on more than one occasion when I've gone and bought something wacky (like kale or cactus pads or guava fruits) without any thought in mind of what to do with them when I got them home.  The Joy of Cooking is a righteous book.  There are particular recipes in other books that I use more often, but if I had to have one book that was my "go to" cookbook above all others, The Joy of Cooking wins out 19 times out of 20.

      Neighborhood Bullies  I still vividly remember chasing one Tyrone Funk down the street, back in the day, after he threatened to beat up some of my guy friends (calling them pussies).  Wearing a garish, flouncy purple dress (for I had just come from the 8th Grade Graduation Dance) I stalked off into the darkness after him, shouting, "You wanna fight?  Fight me!  I'll show you who's a PUSSY!" as he ran away, calling over his shoulder that I was lucky he was raised so well, he didn't hit girls....  Not long after this incident, I caught him bullying a kid on crutches, trying to yank his crutches away.  I threw him up against some lockers, and told him he'd better not ever let me catch him bullying anyone, anywhere, ever again and he made sure I never did.  I discovered in my recent visit with childhood pal Greg (who was witness to this fiasco) that I was not the only one who remembered my interactions with Ty Funk with some fondness. Ah, the memories.    Yesterday afternoon Kate came home from school and asked me if I would walk to the bus stop with her in the morning.  Earlier in the year I'd given a young man a talking to, telling him that since he was bigger and stronger than my little girl, I expected him to restrain himself from hitting her in the head with his book bag.  At that time, I'd told him that if I heard that he couldn't restrain himself, I was going to have to come to the bus stop every afternoon and walk  him  home.  It took a minute for that to sink in, but I stressed that if he couldn't be trusted to roam the neighborhood without an escort, I would be happy to walk him home after school every day to make sure everyone got home safely. That being just about the last thing in the world he wanted, he fell in line.  This kept the peace for several months, but Toumsa and his friend Massad are getting restless again and this time throwing rocks at little girls.  Kate made sure to tell me that they did not throw rocks at her, but they were picking on one of her forlorn-looking little friends, and could I please go and teach them a lesson?  This morning, I happily sauntered up to Toumsa and told him that I'd heard he'd been throwing rocks, and that as one of the biggest kids at the bus stop, I was *sure* he could excercise some self-restraint and not pick on little girls.  He indignantly protested that he had not thrown rocks at *my* little girl, and why did I care.  I replied that I cared because this was my neighborhood, and I wanted it to be a safe place for everyone, so if I heard that he was causing trouble for any of the girls I wasn't going to let it go.  He started to turn away, seemed to be ignoring me, so I turned it up a notch, "Toumsa, what would your family think I told them you were throwing rocks at little girls?"    His jaw dropped.  "How did you know my name?!"  I assured him that everyone in the neighborhood knew his name because he was always causing trouble.  "Well, what's *his* name?" Toumsa said, pointing at his friend.  I told Toumsa that I didn't care what his friend's name was, and that if his friend went around causing as much trouble as he did, I'm sure that I would know his name too.  The little coward gave up his friend's name immediately!  "His name is Massad!"  Fine, then, now I know both of your names.  And I expect both of you big boys to have the good sense to leave the little girls alone from now on.  This kid was clearly praying for the bus to arrive and save him.    There will come a day in the not too distant future when these kids will be too old and cocky for me to intimidate into good behavior this way, but for now I'll just keep handling the neighborhood bullies like I've always done.  Maybe they'll grow up and start acting less like little creeps if they think the Crazy Neighbor Lady is keeping tabs on them, and they're not anonymous and safe from retribution!

       urlLink Mister Rogers, again   Today, 2000 people turned out for the public memorial service for Fred Rogers. When reminded of the date, I once again felt incredibly sad. I grieve for what we've lost in the world with his passing.  Moreso because of dispicable, self-serving, dark-hearted idiots like Fred Phelps.  Phelps you may know from his website ( urlLink www.godhatesfags.com ) or from his group's choice to randomly picket people and organizations that actively provide aid, support, or just plain general acceptance for homosexuals.  Apparently not getting enough publicity for his twisted cause, he and his family/followers have taken to picketing randomly selected churches that belong to denominations that don't actively persecute or speak against homosexuals and homosexuality, which allows them to include as a target, you guessed it, Mr. Rogers.  This nutjob is now trumpeting the message that Mr. Rogers is burning in Hell, not because of anything he did, but because of what he didn't do.  Mr. Rogers never addressed homosexuality at all, and so, by Phelps' logic, he burns in hell.  I hope Phelps and his followers behaved like the cowards they are and decided not to show up to picket the memorial.  Or that if they did, they get no media attention for so doing.  A very large, righteously indignant part of me hopes they showed up and got their asses kicked within an inch of their pathetic, hateful lives by grieving attendees, but I don't suppose that Mr. Rogers himself would approve of such an action.  Still, I'm continually horrified at the depth of hate and cruelty humans are capable of inflicting on the world.

      Oh so busy  Yesterday I was in the house for about an hour.  My friend Greg and his two girls were in town, waiting for wife/mom Nichole to finish some certification training she was doing.  Haven't seen Greg in, oh, 15 years or so.  In addition to taking a painting across town to be scanned, and making trips to the post office and UPS, handing a ton of important time-sensitive e-mail that popped up ("Where are we supposed to ship these books today?" Um, the same damn warehouse address I've given you for the last 6 books, perhaps? "Your account is going to be cancelled in 4 days unless you update your billing information!" So, of the three billing options you have saved in regards to my account you can't find *one* that you like?... Hey where's my restock shipment for books X, Y, and Z that I'm now out of stock on??  Blah, blah, blah.), I also received a delivery of new books and drove copies across town so certain contributors could have them before the weekend, and managed to squeeze in a visit with Greg and his girls.  I took Kate out of school and let her and the girls have the run of the  urlLink Seattle Children's Museum  for a couple of hours.  After a quick lunch, it was back to running around trying to get Kate's things packed for her weekend with her dad, including digging up her birth certificate, her social security card, and other things she needed for her border-crossing interview (her dad applied to get her some sort of fast pass thingy to make their regular border crossings easier).  Several hours of brutal traffic jams later, I found myself at the  urlLink Cascade Mall , child-free and with no one waiting for me to return to Seattle at any particular time.  I took advantage of this and bought tickets to the first available showing of  urlLink X-Men 2 .  It was a couple hours until I could get into the movie, so I bought a couple of books that caught my eye at Waldenbooks, headed out for a sandwich at  urlLink Quiznos , and spent probably an hour reading in the comfy chairs at Starbucks, drinking coffee and waiting for showtime.  I loved X-Men 2!  So good I just about needed a cigarette afterwards!  Heh.  The good thing (for me) is that I'm familiar enough with the source material that I can enjoy the character development and plot of the movie without the crippling geek affliction of knowing everything so well that the slightest deviation from the comic books (or novels or whatever a Geek Favorite movie is based on) ruins the geek's ability to just  enjoy  the movie.  Thus, I was able to groove on the fact that the name Remy LeBeau flashes past on a computer screen (and say to myself, "Ooh, does this mean  urlLink Gambit  for X3?") and just go on back to enjoying the film.  Hooray for me.  When I got back to Seattle, I curled up in bed, munched some  urlLink White Cheddar Cheetos , listened to the Old School Rap station that my digital cable system provides, and did crossword puzzles until I was tired enough to fall asleep.  Good, productive, fun day.  I will probably write more over the weekend on various topics ranging from my youthful obsession with  urlLink Rick Springfield , my thoughts on the  urlLink League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  as a movie, the childhood friends I've managed to reconnect with thanks to the internet, the book  urlLink Jarhead , and why I've saved two books filled with angsty teen poetry that wasn't even written by me.  But for now, Chick needs coffee.

      Easter Bread  A package just arrived from my mother-in-law.  It was  urlLink Greek Easter  on Sunday and Elaine sent her traditional package of  urlLink Greek Easter Bread ,  urlLink koulourakia , and some red-dyed hard-boiled eggs (none of which arrived unbroken), so there will be no running around the house smashing them together to see whose cracks last.  Ironically, two of the few Greek phrases Chris remembers from childhood exposure (or that wasted year of Greek school), aside from words for food, are the traditional Greek Easter statements of, "Christos Anesti" (Christ has risen), and the response of "Alithos Anesti" (Truly He has risen).   If you know Chris at all, these are two things you'd never expect to hear from his mouth.  He does like the Easter Bread, though.  And much like  urlLink Challah , it makes really good French toast once it starts to go a little stale.

      Origins Update  Man, I've been SO busy.  No time for blogging at this convention so far.    Tuesday we left for Columbus, arriving after midnight.  We'd had a hellish connection in Dallas, where we had about 15 minutes to get from the last row of our crowded plane across the entire gigantic horseshoe-shaped Dallas/Ft.Worth airport.  I'll go into more detail on that some other time. Suffice to say that we made the flight but our luggage did not.  The hotel we're in is brand new and we're very pleased.  Because we had to check in with the staff several times due to our late-night arrival, the multiple deliveries for us, and our missing luggage, the staff knows us on sight.  They've been extremely sweet and good-natured about not only our needs but handling the large influx of gamers at the hotel.  Thumbs up to the staff of the Drury Inn.  Wednesday night was the GAMA general meeting and the GAMA elections.  The meeting was well-attended and it seems that I can work with everyone who was elected this year, so that was very good news.  Thursday was the frist day of the show, which I thought was well attended for a Thursday.  I was in and out of the booth for much of the day, so I don't have a sense of how sales went but I feel pleased at the level of exposure we've had.  Our demos have been going off without a hitch as well, which is always a blessed relief.  Thursday night was the GAMA Board meeting, with the new Board of Directors.  Very pleasant and productive meeting, with lots of good reports on the convention from the GAMA staff.  Friday I rearranged my schedule to have time enough to go on an outting to a waterpark with Kate, Mary, and Miranda. Good fun, though I did get a brutal sunburn on my back and shoulders.  Luckily, the sunburn didn't show from under my dress for the Origins Awards.  The ceremony is another subject deserving its own entry, so I'll just say that it went off remarkably well considering how many last minute things were snafu'd.  At the end of the ceremony I was announced as the new Chair of the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, and to my stunned amazement received an embarrassingly long standing ovation from the attendees.  Congratulations and condolences were offered after the show, and now the hard part begins.  Two more days of show, though today is half-over as I write this.  Kate went with Mary and Miranda to the zoo and aquarium as part of the "Spouse Track" of offerings for the non-gaming family members of the gamers who attend the convention.  Tomorrow I'm intending to take some of my off-time from the booth to take Kate to COSI, which is a really fun museum, great for kids.    We're not flying home until Monday night, so I intend to relax for as long as I can get away with on Monday before check-out.  More updates are likely to happen then.

In addition to making sure we've got all our Green Ronin ducks in a row, I've got personal obligations to fulfill.  There is a big, ugly membership meeting and election in my future, which I will be forced to attend Wednesday, a tedious board of directors meeting to follow that on Thursday, the Origins Awards ceremony and all that entails on Friday... I'm stressed and tired and cranky.  Will definitely feel better if I can get the Palm working.  When my Palm isn't working, I forget things.

      Finished  Read it.  Will begin reading it to Kate tomorrow.  Must say I'm a tad disappointed; my feelings reading the center portion of the book were very similar to the feelings Chris describes feeling when reading Robert Jordan.  Too much with the characters whining and speculating and feeling sorry for themselves, and a lot of "Man, girls sure are strange, unknowable creatures." Then again, I had the same sort of response to Luke Skywalker's character in Star Wars (good god what a whiner he was!). Still, after being kept waiting for two years, I guess I had hoped for a somewhat tighter story.  She sticks closely to the forumula of all the other books, but packs about 400 extra pages into it.  Must also admit that the author's whole pre-release revelation that a major character is killed off (moving herself to tears with that one) and that several characters suffer *near* fatal injuries leading up to the actual event in the book struck me as deliberate cock-tease, trying to artificially add suspense and excitement to the story.  I really dislike that kind of marketing-driven hype.  But it was good enough for a kid's book.

      Harry Potter  We nearly had a disaster with our Harry Potter outing!  I called the Barnes & Noble closest to my house at about 9:15 to see if they were open for Harry Potter.  Of course they were, but I hadn't been able to find any confirmation about it.  They asked if I'd reserved a book, and when I said no, they told me they had some small number of books available for people who didn't think to reserve, but it was first come first served and there were people lining up for the books already.  If we missed out, their next shipment of books wouldn't be until Tuesday.  Eek!  I'd already told Kate we'd try to get the book before we flew to Ohio Tuesday!   I explained the situation to Kate and checked with her about what she wanted to do.  Made clear that we might not be able to get a book, that we might get down there and be too late.  Her response, "That would be a disappointment.  I might cry, because I've been waiting sooooo long.  But I want to try it."    So we did! We showed up to the store at about 9:40.  Every parking space in the lot (which normally serves 5 big stores) was full.  The store was *crawling* with people, lots of people in costumes, activities for the kids (trivia, wand-making, guess how many Bertie Botts Beans are in the jar, face painting, get your picture taken in a wizard hat with the Harry Potter standee, etc). Each check-stand was one "house" and color coded to a ticket, each person that reserved a copy got a ticket for their house with a number on it.  The walk-ins were all in Gryffindor; we got ticket number 122.  At midnight they started calling people to the front in groups of 10.  At 1:25am we finally made it to the front!    We got home at 1:45am and I stayed up reading until 3:00am... -pre-screening the book for Kate, you understand.

      Irritating  Boy, I can tell school is out.  I keep getting pink and purple Instant Messages from kids every time I sign onto my AOL account.  "hey, who r u?"  "r u Nikki?"  I try telling these kids that I'm not the person they're looking for, but to no avail.  They always think I'm kidding around, or else they're just enjoying screwing with me.  "yes u r.  i know who u r.  this is kenny, sarah's little bro" or "do u go to krappington high?"  I could just ignore them, but I figure they might want to actually get the right IM handle for their little friend. They're probably looking for Nikchick123 or Nikichik or some other variation on my handle. I politely request that they check my profile (that's why I have one) but these kids either don't know how to use the function, or my profile doesn't come up for them because without fail they tell me I don't have one. Sometimes I'll get a "who r u" message, I tell them I'm not who they're looking for, they go away, only to IM me the next day "is this Nikki?"  Guess what, I'm STILL not the kid you're looking for.  I could just block all IMs, or all IMs except from people I know, but I do actually talk to some people by IM (like people on my demo teams or other industry associates from across the continent) and I don't want to accidentally block them.  I already has a bad experience where my spam filter was blocking legitmate mail from freelancers and paying customers. Very bad.  It's really a minor annoyance, but there are definitely some days when I wonder why I try to be nice about it at all.

      Summer Begins  Kate is finished with First Grade.  Now for those lazy days of summer.  When I picked Kate up from school today, we walked over to Starbucks for a treat, to kill half an hour until the  urlLink farmer's market  opened. On the walk there (all of a block and half) Kate ran into an older boy who hugged her and chattered to her and happily said he'd see her next year.  When I asked Kate who he was, she couldn't remember his name.  She's terrible with names, which doesn' t help me learn who her little friends are.  Then we saw another little girl poking her head out of a beauty shop we passed.  Kate stopped to talk to her: "Does your mom work here?  You're lucky!  My mom makes books.  She runs a company.  See you next year!"  Again, I'd never heard Kate mention this girl, who seemed very happy to hear that Kate would be coming back to Orca agan next year.  At Starbucks Kate had a chocolate milk and a frosted sugar cookie and I had a chocolate malt frappuccino.  Kate looked out the window and chattered to me about how many people from her school she was seeing walk past, while I looked over her end of the year reports.  Very confusing stuff, these school evaluations.  Even though Kate scored a "12" (which is exactly where she should be for reading skills) her reading level needs to be 14 or greater (the "level" and the "score" are different scales I guess) and so Kate is simultaneously called "text-book first grader" and yet "does not meet the Spring 2003 standard" -- but just two months ago was tested twice and I was told she's also eligible for the city's  urlLink Spectrum/Advanced Learning  program.  Now, which is it?  Is she not up to standards, or is she eligible for the gifted "advanced learning" program?  I puzzled over the reports until the farmer's market opened, and then we wandered over.  It was a light day at the farmer's market.  I bought half a flat of organic strawberries, which are so amazingly superior to the store-bought strawberries it's a wonder anyone buys strawberries at Safeway ever!  The organic berries are smaller, but with such sweet, concentrated flavor and a delicious scent.  I pulled out my copy of  urlLink Small Batch Preserving  and I'm going to use some of these berries to make a couple of small jars of jam tomorrow.  It's been years since I did any preserving, but I'd like to do some more of it this year.    I also picked up a loaf of fresh honey wheat bread.  Kate and I have a ritual where she gets to pick certain things at the market, like the bread (she always buys a round loaf of honey wheat from the same vendor), a cookie if she wants it (from the lady who sells cookies and savory tarts), organic cheese (last week she chose a small wheel of organic gouda, so we're set for cheese for the rest of the month), and flowers (my favorite of her choices so far this year had to be the fragrant, pastel sweet pea blossoms).  I fill in with purchases for the adult taste, like fava beans (I've become hooked on these time intensive little beauties), asparagus (today's selection), roasted hazelnuts, wild mushrooms, and big bunches of crisp, green, fresh mint (is that a mojito calling me?  I think it is!).  We're going to miss three weeks of the market this summer, but I'm making a real effort to shop there on Wednesdays the weeks we're in town.  It really is just such a pleasure, it's a shame not to indulge in the experience during the few months of the year we can enjoy an outdoor market so close to our home.

      Potluck  Tonight was Kate's end of school potluck.  Tomorrow is the last day of school for the kids, with early dismissal.  Chris and I attended, and we contributed Kate's favorite dish of mine, "nachos".  I layer a pan with refried beans, an extra can of pinto beans (for texture), some Taco-spiced cooked ground beef (if I'm feeling fancy), sour cream, cheddar cheese (or that pre-grated Mexican mix they're selling in stores these days) and top the whole thing off with black olives.  Kate is VERY disappointed if her nachos don't include black olives.  Totally simple, mostly pre-packaged, but she loves it.  Lemme tell you, whatever the drawbacks of Kate's school have been, the potlucks are not one of them.  Those hippies know how to cook!  Pastas, bean salads, couscous salads, lettuce salads, bread salads, fruit salads. I stuffed myself: curried chickpeas, curly noodles, pesto pasta, potato salad, fresh tomatoes and mixed lettuce with balsamic vinegar, lasagne.  All the desserts were gone by the time we arrived, but who cares?  My nachos disappeared as if a swarm of locusts had descended upon them.  Some of the musical parents were playing piano and singing for the kids, a regular little jazz ensemble.  It was quite festive.  Afterward, we stayed for the PTA meeting, which was just as dull and tedious as such meetings are rumored to be.  Still, I feel an obligation to be more involved in Kate's school, and I wanted to know what the issues facing the school are going into next year.  We have a new principle coming in, a vacancy in the superintendent spot, and budget cuts at the local, state, and federal levels all at the same time.  Making sure Kate fits into her school and that school gives her the best education we can get out of it weighs heavy on my mind right now.  On the way home, Chris and I were cracking up, because we had Kate believing that while she's at school on Mondays we have "Cake Day" where we bake and eat a whole cake before she gets home.  I said, "Oh man, what are we going to do now that school's out and Kate is going to be home on Mondays?  We'll have to bake our cakes in the middle of the night and have Cake Night."  She was skeptical, thinking that we were likely joking, but the thought of Cake Day (and Chris's  urlLink well-known love of cake? ) was too tantalizing for her to resist.  "No fair, I want some cake!   Tell me  when you have Cake Day."   pause   "Anyone who's serious about Cake Day and not joking, raise your hand..." just as Chris reaches up to scratch his ear. "Are you raising your hand?!  Tell me!"    Sometimes Kate is just adorable and makes us laugh really hard.  She's awfully sweet at this age.

      Headache and Busy  Ah, preconvention prep.  How I loathe it.  I need to get my badge requests in for GenCon.  The California bureaucratic body that issues the seller's permits for Comic Con has not deigned to get back to me with my permit, so I need to sort that out as well.  Have to arrange to ship the convention display, which means making sure the kit is together and ready to go.  The new graphics have not been put together yet, so we probably won't have those for Origins.  Managed to find people to give the eulogies for Chris Bledsoe, Paul Randles, and Sid Sackson, and hopefully we will have the Hall of Fame inductees on hand to accept their inductions. Made arrangements for our late-running June release to ship directly to Origins so we can have some on hand for the convention.  Sent the proofs back for another project today, while confirming with the printer that two cases of our reprint should come here to Seattle, and what quantities we want printed on the other two books they have the files for.  Tried to track down an order for a book placed by a prisoner who hasn't received it, prompting me to once again work on the webstore so that I can offer several different options for shipping (including UPS and Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation) that aren't so easily lost or mangled.  Eventually had to give up in frustration for the day, as none of the modules would load correctly (even though they were downloaded and installed from the shopping cart company's website as per their posted directions).  Still have to make GenCon and DragonCon flight arrangements, plus pay for the booth and the hotel for DragonCon too.    Somewhere around 2:00pm I felt a headache coming on.  I tried heading it off by having a beer and taking some over the counter migrane pills, but no dice.  Driving around in the hot car did not help; I definitely had light sensitivity happening, and of course it was a warm, beautiful, sunny day.  Stopped at Fed Ex, drove down to the PO Box, and stopped at the store where I got everything for tonight's dinner but the fresh mussels I wanted.  Tried another store, but no luck there either.  Substituted frozen scallops and went ahead with the recipe, but by the time I'd cooked dinner, my headache was bad enough that I didn't feel like eating anything at all.  Need to put Kate in the bath and get her to bed.  She'll definitely want me to read the Series of Unfortunate Events book we're mid-way through.  Can't wait until I can lay down, but I really need to type up the code of conduct and How You Earn Points materials for my demo volunteers.  Oh, and as is typical, technology hates me again today.  My Palm is having fatal errors and the G3 won't recognize the firewire external hard disk I bought to back up the company files, or the CD burner.  Need to get all those things sorted out before convention season gets into full swing, or I won't get back to them until October.  And I can't live without my Palm until October!

       As has become tradition, my mother-in-law sent Chris giant  urlLink lobsters  again for his birthday. She called to be sure we'd be home to accept the delivery, and we were expecting lobsters to arrive on Monday, but she went for the Saturday delivery instead. Since I'd planned a  party for Chris, I totally wasn't intending to cook lobsters yesterday afternoon but I opened the box and took a peek at the lobsters, and they were looking none too peppy. I was worried that the larger of the two was possibly no longer with us, but it twitched half-heartedly after I poked at it for a while).  NO WAY they were going to last another day, they had to be cooked immediately.  So, we had some giant lobsters for lunch, we have a ton of meat left over (they were just too big to eat!), and I went crazy making lobster stock before the party.  This month's issue of  urlLink Cooking Light  arrived Friday and when I was reading it what did I see but a recipe for lobster stock!  And, coincidentally, I have lobsters lying around the house and just enough time to make stock before the party.  It was a sign, a portent.  I had to obey.  The party at the  urlLink Capitol Club  was delightful, the Blue Room just the perfect setting. Only twice during the night did anyone uninvited intrude into the room.  The first was a drugged up club-goer who twitched his way into the room and tried to make himself comfortable, until we told him it was a private party and all stared at him until his paranoia kicked in and he got up and left again.  We heard the doorman forcibly ejecting him with a, "What are you doing in here, we told you to LEAVE," followed by a quick apology to the room for not noticing he'd slipped in.  The second intrusion was a twenty-something partier who stuck her head in the room and bitchily barked at us to "Stop it right now."  Since everyone else was in brisk, geek conversation, we had no idea what she was talking about.  "Stop throwing ice!"  We looked around at our iceless drinks, and back to her, baffled. Conversation screeched to a halt.  Luckily, Sasha had been sitting with a view to the door and had seen some ice go flying past while the woman was standing there, and knew what the hell she was talking about and jumped in to tell Righteous Indignation Chick that the ice was coming from elsewhere.  Good thing, too, or I would have had to match her Righteous Indignation with some of my own, and goodness knows that couldn't have ended well.  Besides my favorite part, where John Tynes shows up late to the party, wearing the same  urlLink Trogdor the Burninator  shirt that the birthday boy is wearing, my next favorite bit was where our waiter, overhearing the raging geek debate about whether Spiderman or Batman is older, picks up on Ray's remark about the  urlLink Rawhide Kid  and asks if it's true that the Rawhide Kids is an out of the closet, gay cowboy comic book character.  To his delight, we confirm that it's real.  My second favorite part of the evening (only coming in second because I'm currently smitten with Strong Bad) was the ever-gracious  urlLink Stan!  offering to belly dance, since Chris's one "disappointment" of the evening was the lack of belly dancers.  Lotsa fun, laughter, and good friends.   We closed the place out, cursing all the while at Seattle's lame policy of bum rushing people out of bars and clubs at 1:30am (even though they technically don't close until 2am, when the clock strikes 2 the lights must be off and the doors locked, no stragglers).  We milled around on the streets with a couple hundred other refugees from the surrounding area, and debated moving the dregs of the party over to Ray and Christine's private room, but eventually decided to call it a night.  John and Ray apparently drove the looped Mr. Mitch home, which was undoubtedly a good plan.  When we left them, Mitch had just peed on a building (for lack of a bathroom), was munching happily on a sausage purchased from a street vendor, and was looking for an attractive young woman who might answer the night's burning question of "What the hell is a  urlLink camel toe ?".

      Performance  Chris and I went to Kate's school's End of Year performance.  We sat through two kindergarten classes singing.  The first class was sweet, the second class (led by Kate's Kindergarten teacher) was a mess, all the kids singing and shouting out "lyrics" to a complicated song they'd recently "written" all out of unison.  Next were the first graders, Kate singing with her class, oh so sweetly.  Kate also joined the "Orca Junior Choir" for two songs, including  urlLink It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)  and a song listing the fifty states called The Red, White, and Blues.  Tried to take a bunch of pictures, but I was sitting too far back to get good shots.  Kate's dad came down from Vancouver for the performance and the girl was thrilled that he did.  I'm glad I told him about it and strongly suggested he come, it meant the world to her.  The two of them left for a weekend together as soon as her part in the performance was over.  Chris and I stopped for dinner at the nearby  urlLink Vietnam's Pearl .  The food was great, enhanced no doubt by my ravenous hunger.  I'd had nothing to eat all day but a cup of coffee and then the meal deal at  urlLink Fatburger  for lunch (which, while not as good as  urlLink In-n-Out Burger , did tide me over for several hours), and by the time we'd gotten food it was 8:45pm.  Vietnam's Pearl is a decent place, but unfortunately reminds me of a couple of former friends with whom I've fallen out.  One couple I now truly despise and I dislike doing things that remind me they exist.  The other fellow isn't 100% unredeemably loathed, but unfortunately is not only a close friend of the couple, but is also an unflinching apologist for both their personal conduct towards my family and the outrageous corporate misuse inflicted on my husband in the last year of his corporate job.  Since I can't forgive either of those things, and since this guy had the nerve to stand in my kitchen and tell me I was, essentially, fucked up for holding my beliefs and opinions on the matter, I've washed my hands of him as well.  It's better for my mental health all around to forget them, but certain stores, restaurants, or other places where we shared experiences crash in on my voluntary amnesia now and then.  Tomorrow night is Chris's birthday party.  I wish I could have done more for him to express my love and adoration, but I fear I can never top the year I kidnapped him and took him to a bed & breakfast for the weekend.  (I can, however, usually willfully forget that the estranged couple I just referenced unforgivably decided to book a weekend at the same bed and breakfast for the same weekend we were there, and met us at the door of the place to announce "We've seen your suite! It was huge, you have two rooms! We laid on your bed!" before Chris or I even had the chance to check in, and before I had the chance to fully spring the surprise of having rented the best suite in the place on Chris.  Gah, who does something like that and why was I ever friends with those people?)

David Brinkley was like Mr. Rogers for adults.  He was a class act, a professional, a talented journalist and a gentleman.  He refused to be classified, sometimes weighing in as a conservative on one issue, sometimes as a liberal on another.  "It depends on the issue," he said.  I loved his ability to balance polite, respectful discourse without shying away from trying to address the myriad political and social issues that face the world.  He was a fine man.

      Chris Bledsoe     Last year Chris Bledsoe, a friend from the game industry, lost his battle with cancer.  I always tell people that Chris was a hell of a guy, and I barely knew him!  We met when my Chris was working for his "best WotC boss", Bob, who had been Bledsoe's boss at a couple of other jobs and who was still a good friend.  Bob, Chris, Chris, and I were up in the wilds of British Columbia at a fun little gaming convention held by a local retailer/doctor.  (Guess you've gotta do what you can to fill out the necessary jobs when you live in the wilds of British Columbia.)  Bob introduced us to Chris while we hung out in the host's closed retail store.  I forget why we were there... could have been to tour the place, could have been because Grant wanted to hunt up some product or something.  I just remember sitting around  with Bob and the Chrises and chatting away about their wild exploits as younger, less domesticated men.  An hour or so into meeting Chris Bledsoe, I found out that he'd only recently recovered from cancer.  He looked fit and healthy, though his hair was barely a stubble.  Apparently he'd previously had long hair and a big ol' moustache, but the cancer therapy had ruined that look for him, for a while.  He was in fine spirits, quite jolly, and not concerned about his prospects in any visible way.  My impression of him was that he was a little guy, slightly built, but that might have been a side effect of his cancer or treatment too.  He was definitely a good deal shorter than me, though, possibly as much as a foot.  Small height, but BIG personality.  That's all it took.  I was absolutely smitten with the man, in a completely non-romantic way.  He was one of those guys who has charisma.  I'd only see him a few times a year, as we each did our stints as game company lackeys at various conventions and trade shows, but it was always a pleasure.  He always greeted me as if I were some long-lost friend, and even chatting with him for a short time was guaranteed to have me laughing and smiling.  He was "a character" I think you'd say.  Mischievous, the kind of guy who would purposely flood your bathtub while you were passed out in your hotel room, as a prank.  "Colorful" but just sweet natured enough to not be a fucker.  He always had a posse, made up of loyal friends, guys he'd worked with and gone to bat for.  Last March, I saw Chris Bledsoe at one of these shows, in Las Vegas.  The show was wrapping up, and I was dashing off somewhere, when who should I spy but Mr. Bledsoe, all decked out in black, adorned with flame (befitting his personality).  I swung past him, commenting on how he was looking sharp, and he happily announced, "I'm on my way to my wedding!"  Sure enough, his lovely girlfriend and "the usual suspects" were standing right there (all of them dressed up and looking nice) but until he said anything, I couldn't have told you there were other people in his group.  It was all about him, a moment in the spotlight, or so it seemed to me.  I stopped to give him a hug and a kiss and wished him and Stacey my heartfelt congratulations, then waved them happily on to their way.  That was the last time I saw Chris Bledsoe, and less than five months later he was gone forever.  As part of this year's Origins Awards ceremony, there will be a memorial for Chris.  If I have my way, his good friend and business partner will be making the trip to deliver a speech and share a little bit of Chris with those who may only have ever known him through his work.  We're working out the details now and I'm hopeful that it will all come together on this short notice.  If his friends can't be there to give the memorial, I will likely be slotted into the spot and will probably give an oral version of pretty much what I've written here.  I'm a poor substitute for those who knew him well, but if it falls to me I'll do my utmost to make sure he gets his due and one last moment in the spotlight before his peers.

      ARGH Computers  The comments function keeps breaking!  I can't make any changes to the template for my blog, or the code for the comments function which is supposed to end with [  resets itself to [& l t ;] /noscript> every time I press save/publish. It was only doing this when I tried to make changes to the template itself (like adding all those little images to the links) but now it's broken after I merely tried to publish an update, and it *refuses* to be fixed.  I had a relatively peaceful month or two where the planets were aligned, the proper animal sacrifices had been made, or I'd suffered enough to earn a little good computer karma.

       urlLink Shut Up Little Man!   The good Mr. John Tynes familiarized me with Shut Up Little Man some years ago.  Click the link, read his review, then read on if you're not familiar with the subject.  Done?  That's my mother's husband.  No, he's not actually Peter or Ray (he's got the much more evocative moniker of Virgil) but last night, as struggled to get my mother's out-dated pile of hand-me-down computer bits to coalesce into a functional machine, I could hear him going on from the other side of the house.  The smell of cigarette smoke wafting down the hallway, shouting in his half-deaf way, I picked up snippets of his side of the conversation: "Some goddamn garlic in it... or sumthin'.  Or tobacco!  Throw some tobacco in there.... I'm serious!  Find some butts or sumthin' and just crush 'em up in there...   What're ya heatin' it up for?  He don't need that!"  It was in the same slurry tone and inflection as any of the Shut Up Little Man snippets.  I completely expected to hear him follow up with "...because you crucified it. You ruined it. Goddamn you!"  Before I left for home, he also treated me to his views on training dogs.  Apparently, "you gotta beat 'em; that's the only way to learn 'em, they don't understand nothin' else."  Unless, of course, they're dogs that bite children or eat chickens: "Don't matter how much you love 'em, you can't ever change a bitin' dog--or a chicken eatin' dog, so you gotta just shoot 'em," BANG (he slams his fist into his hand for effect).  Needless to say, I always feel like I've walked into the Twilight Zone whenever he's around.  My mother is not that way, I have no fucking idea how they ended up married to each other.

      Entirely too hot again today.  Puttered around the house, hanging curtains, installing more shelves in the bedroom.  Piece by piece the house comes together.  I love looking around the house and seeing my own handiwork.  Even though I've mostly limited myself to installing ceiling fans, shelves, or hanging the occasional picture, I still feel like I'm pulling off my own little home improvement show.  Making a little day trip down to see my mother and grandmother with Kate tomorrow.  Mom's computer blew up and we have a surplus of old machines around here that will easily meet her needs (which amount to "has a modem" and "has a word processor"-maybe "has solitare installed").  Today was the day to see how my attempt at  urlLink Nigella Lawson 's recipe for "asian gravlax" (which I've had curing in the fridge for about 3 days) turned out. I felt too uncomfortably hot to eat, but Chris made a couple of bagels with cream cheese and the salmon (which he declared was "between sashimi and lox") and said it was good.  I've still got about a pound and a half of cured salmon to polish off!  Sometimes I get a little carried away with cooking stuff.

      Bend it like Beckham  It was sweltering today, so I begged and whined until I got my way and finally got to see this movie!  Ah, air-conditioned comfort!  Seattle has so few truly unpleasantly hot days, we're always a bit taken aback when they hit.  When temps get into the 90s, most Seattle homes don't have any air conditioning to compensate, and fans lose their effectiveness when they're just blowing hot air over you.   urlLink Bend it like Beckham  was a cute movie, as I expected, David Edelstein's snarky review notwithstanding. It was a perfectly acceptible family film, and a fine way to spend a couple hours.  Had to explain a scene or two that went over Kate's head, and especially what "Paki" meant and why the cute English-Indian heroine reacted so angrily when she was called it.    Saw previews for several art-house films that I'll be wanting to see.  I've flagged but still haven't seen the documentary on  urlLink Andy Goldsworthy .  Definitely want to catch that before it leaves theatres, not much time left on that one I fear.  I watched and enjoyed  urlLink Rabbit Proof Fence , though it was not "family friendly" as the review I read claimed, at least not for my tender-hearted daughter who sobbed her way out of the theatre at the end.  In a similar vein was the preview for  urlLink Whale Rider , which looked right up my alley.  And another documentary-style movie on birds and flight, called  urlLink Winged Migration .  I would much rather see any of these movies than be forced to sit through even another preview of Dumber and Dumberer, or Daddy Daycare!  I'll take the art house ANY day.

       My sore throat is starting to abate.  This pleases me greatly, I hope to be much more productive in the couple of weeks we have leading up to Origins.

Aside from being a famous television personality (that little thing, p'shaw) he's very much like any of the other wonderful, talented, sensitive, socially-conscious, smart-assed geeks I've surrounded myself with, and reading his blog is a delight.  He's both entertaining and familiar, and reading his heartfelt stories about his interactions with his step-sons, or his all-out smitten-ness with his wife never fails to bring a smile to my face.  Plus his favorite food is  urlLink Guinness .  A man after my own heart!

      Freedom to Read  Do you like to read?  If you do, perhaps you are as disturbed as I am by the far-reaching effects of  urlLink The USA Patriot Act , particularly Section 215.  While much of The USA Patriot Act concerns itself with foreign nationals, Section 215 in particular has given the FBI power to search ANYONE'S library and book buying records without a warrant, without probable cause of any crime or intent to commit a crime. Furthermore, librarians and booksellers are not allowed to report that searches have taken place or that records were turned over to the government or they can be prosecuted. Carleton College, in my "other hometown" of Northfield, Minnesota, has put up urlLink this interesting FAQ  for their library patrons.  Amazingly, there actually appears to be some slight movement in Congress to put a stop to some of this insanity: Representative Bernie Sanders of Vermont has introduced legislation into the House called  urlLink The Freedom to Read Protection Act, HR 1157 .  Senator Barbara Boxer of California has introduced a similar bill in the Senate, The Librarian Bookseller Protection Act, Senate 1158.  If you like to read, support the Freedom To Read Protection Act!  I spent the morning contacting my representatives and urging their support on these bills. In a letter that's making the rounds through teachers' groups, librarians, and writers, another woman suggests the following ways to show support and help move things forward:  1. Contact  urlLink Representative Sanders  and  urlLink Senator Boxer  to voice your support.  2. Get HR 1157 out of its subcommittee, into the House Judiciary Committee and then onto the House floor for debate.  HR 1157 is now in the  urlLink Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security . The members of that subcommittee are  urlLink Tom Feeney  (R, Florida),  urlLink Bob Goodlatte  (R, Virginia),  urlLink Steve Chalbot  (R, Ohio),  urlLink Mark Green  (R, Wisconsin),  urlLink Ric Keller  (R, Florida),  urlLink Mike Pence  (R, Indiana),  urlLink J. Randy Forbes  (R, Virginia),  urlLink Robert Scott  (D, Virginia),  urlLink Adam Schiff  (D, California),  urlLink Sheila Jackson Lee  (D, Texas),  urlLink Maxine Waters  (D. California), and  urlLink Martin Meehan  (D, Massachusetts). The chair is  urlLink Howard Coble  (R, North Carolina). The phone number for the subcommitee is (202) 225-3926. If you know someone who lives in the states of these Representatives, it will be especially meaningful for them to hear from a constituent.  3.  Contact the chair of the Judiciary House Committtee,  urlLink F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.  (R, Wisconsin) to tell him you want HR 1157 brought to the floor of the House. Representative Sensenbrenner is a Republican who has berated the administration for its policies of secrecy. Again, if you know people in Wisconsin, get them to contact Representative Sensenbrenner.  4. Contact your own Representative or Senator to ask if he or she is a co-sponsor of HR 1157 or S 1158 and stress that you strongly support co-sponsorship.  5. Contact those who have co-sponsored HR 1157. Call Bernie Sander’s office to get their names and contact information. Sanders’ office number is (202) 225-4115, if you want to ask for an updated list.

      Busy  Got Kate all bathed and packed up for camp last night.  She's going on an overnight camp excursion with her class today and tomorrow, to return Friday afternoon.  We had quite the checklist of things to bring, while at the same time being cautioned that the kids were expected to carry their own gear (including a bag full of clothes and toiletries, a sleeping bag and a pillow).    I need to haul Kate off to school, fill mail orders, then we have a lunch date with the fine folks at The Game Mechanics.  I expect I won't be eating any lunch, though.  Chris and I tried to go to lunch Monday and I just left with the feeling that food was stuck in my throat.  Unpleasant.  I've been sticking to liquids and mushy stuff since.  After lunch I hope to make a short stop at IKEA for curtains and an above-the-bed shelf for the bedroom.  I'm tired of being awakened at 5:30am when the sun begins to lighten my bedroom, even though the blinds are down, and I'm tired of the endless piles of books accumulating on the head and footboards of the bed because we read in bed and have nowhere else for our bed-reading books to live.  I have something to return from my last visit to IKEA.  I'm hoping the purchases don't over run the returns too badly.  I'm in the final stages of several projects for the summer conventions as well. I'd be much more productive if I didn't have this throat issue bothering me.  It seems to flare up at night, where I wake up in pain trying to swallow, and that's been making me cranky and tired during the day.  I was literally falling asleep in front of my computer yesterday.  Definitely bad timing, as I need to be as productive as possible before we head to Origins in under three weeks!

       urlLink Peter  suggested that I might have what he came down with a while ago, essentially canker sores in the throat.  Having done a little web search, I think he's onto something.  My symptoms line up correctly.  Since I'm able to get along alright now with generous applications of my 222s and alternately hot drinks or popsicles, I'm thinking I'm going to wait it out for a few days and see if it goes away on its own.  Being self-employed sucks for insurance, so if I can avoid going to the doctor (especially only to be told that there's nothing they can do, or that the problem needs to run its course) all the better for me.  Since I'm no longer in the sort of pain that had me cowering in my bed on Saturday night, I'll probably be able to tough it out.  Still sucks, but not in that mind-blowing agony kind of way.

      Sore throat!  What started out as a nagging tickle in the back of my throat yesterday has turned into a full blown, terribly painful sore throat.  I'm having trouble swallowing anything, even my own saliva.  I'm unable to sleep as I keep waking up choking and with a throat that feels swollen and on fire.  Drinking hurts, not drinking hurts, talking hurts, even breathing hurts.  No other obvious symptoms of illness, no fever, no cough, no congestion, not even a headache, though I do have some hellaciously swollen glands in my neck to go along with the soreness.  I've dug out and tried every throat medication in the house: Tylenol sore throat syrup (all gone now, and what little there was only helped briefly), an ancient bottle of Chloroseptic spray (which tastes god-awful and helps the pain for about 10 seconds), lozenges (which make my tongue feel coated but seem not to reach the back of my throat).  No good.  I never realized how often I swallowed until it started to hurt every time!  Tomorrow is Sunday (technically today, but I haven't had a night's sleep and it's dark out, so I'm continuing to call it tomorrow) and aside from a trip to the emergency room I'm not optimistic that I will find any pain relief.  I hope this either subsides or I can get to the doctor first thing Monday. I fear I have strep throat, which needs antibiotic treatment to go away.  The idea that I'll have to struggle along until office hours so I can get some antibiotics has me whimpering already.

      Heatwave  We've had a break from the heatwave hitting Seattle.  Yesterday was unbearably hot in the house, at least 15 degrees hotter than the temp outside, which was reportedly 93.  We gave up getting much done and decided to hit happy hour at one of the air-conditioned downtown bars, and then perhaps go to see 28 Days Later or another film that struck our fancy.  We ended up at  urlLink The Brooklyn , for their happy hour oysters and  urlLink Berrytinis .  It didn't feel properly decadent to be out alone, so at 5:45 I rang Christine's cell phone and she happily clipped out of work at 6:00pm to join us for the last half hour.  Once she arrived, she rang Ray who joined us for another drink, and we hung around the place until after 8:00.  Giving up on hitting the movies at that point, we tranferred the party over to R&C's pleasant back yard.  Christine treated us to wine, fruit, bread, and cheese, and we watched the last rays of daylight fade away just a bit before 10:00pm.  Returned to the still-sweltering Chez Ronin around 11:30pm and went to bed feeling hot and uncomfortably full.  Too much good food to be had.  Tonight is game night, or I might be tempted to try out another happy hour, even without the heat as motivation.  Still summery enough that I'm definitely going off to make myself a caprese salad with the heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil I picked up at  urlLink Whole Foods  the other day.  Yum, the taste of summer!

      Goodbye Lila  My dad just called to tell me that my grandmother passed away this morning. My uncle Jack called him this morning from Arizona to break the news. Grandma had taken a turn for the worse sometime last week and Jack was able to go down to be with them.  No details yet, but the memorial will be taking place in my birthplace of Ely, Minnesota sometime in the next two weeks to two months.  I'll definitely attend.  I'm all the more grateful that I had the chance to go down to see her a last time this spring.  We've been on the road so much and have had so much happening that it hardly seems like just three months ago that I was  urlLink visiting Arizona .  I'm saddest for my devoted grandfather.  Grandma was insulated from much of pain and loss from her disease.  Grandpa watched it all, loved her and stayed with her and doted on her until the end. I can't imagine being in his place, after sixty years together. I had always imagined that her lingering would be the hardest part, but after seeing them together in April, I don't think losing her completely (even just the shell of who she used to be) is going to be any easier on him.

      GenCon is OVAH!  We had our best year ever.  Sold out of product on Friday, had more delivered by Saturday, were sold out again before Sunday.  Constantly busy.  Saturday night we went out to dinner with the New York crew for something quick and dirty, just burgers and beers.  They all went off to play some games together for old times, and I struck off on my own to hook up with Hal and others at the White Wolf party.  I haven't been to a White Wolf party in about 7 years, but I knew my old pal Stewart was going to be there and I wanted to have a few minutes to chat with him again.  During the night I also ran into Mark Hagen, Josh Timbrook, Richard Thomas (all fellows from my era at WW).  Richard, Stewart, and I stood around talking about our kids, which really made me feel like an old fart.  I wrote a much longer post, with links and so on, from Chris's laptop at the show, but I'm too lazy to go dig it up and as it's now Wednesday I think a return to normal posting is in order.  I may get back around to recapping the show but I figure it's best to get this one up on the blog for the moment.

      Friday, GenCon  Friday was again quite busy.  Nearly sold out of the suitcase full of blue Cosmo the Moon Monkey plushies I brought to the show.  Have also sold out of Mutants & Masterminds, Plot & Poison, and Testament, among others.  Had to have the warehouse send up a restock for us just to have things to sell on Saturday!  Dozens of people asked about the two or three books we have that have been repeatedly delayed, and I desperately want those books to come out so we can fill those requests.  I feel much internal stress over those delays, but expect it to be resolved in the next month or two, FINALLY.  Friday was also the ENnie awards ceremony.  After working the booth much of the day (and hearing that a person I despise specifically waited around until I finally left the booth so he could dart over and buy Testament without running into me...smarter than I'd give him credit for!) Chris and I dashed off to supper with our publisher/retailer friends Dave and Mandy from the UK, and then returned to the convention center for the EN World awards.  After last year's crushing losses to Wizards of the Coast in every category, I was determined not to get my hopes up.  And, as is typical, I was again totally wrong about the outcome.  We did stunningly well and in some categories (much to my amazement!) we carried home trophies that I never thought we had a chance to win against competition that I thought was impossible to beat.  The ceremony was great fun and funny (both on purpose and inadvertantly) and a vast improvement over last year's "ceremony in the hallway" event.  I was gratified to see many other of our peers receiving awards that I felt they deserved as well.  The competition was stiff and the nominees were all of high quality.  Very well done.  After the event we had time to hook up with some friends in the sports bar downstairs (ack! sports bar??) for a drink and some laughs before last call.  Tonight I hope to get out to see a little of Indy, as I've seen next to nothing outside of the convention hall and my hotel.  White Wolf is having a big announcement, and while I don't have any particular interest in what their big announcement is I'm inclined to go because some friends from my White Wolf days (including people I haven't seen in years and would love to catch up with) will be there.  For now, duty calls.  Two more days on the floor, two more days to introduce people to our products and hopefully earn their respect and trust in an overly crowded field of D20 game products.

      GenCon Whirlwind  Arrived in Indy Thursday morning after a hellish over-night flight and a three hour layover in Atlanta where I tried to get a little sleep curled up on the floor in a corner of the airport.  Indianapolis did not make a good initial impression on us, especially when I arrived to hear that the people at the hotel were insisting to Hal that the booth display was not there (despite my confirmation from someone there that they'd arrived that day before AND their assurances that they'd note it was ok to release the packages to my business partner, Hal Mangold).  Then we arrived at the hotel to hear from a very snippy desk clerk that there were no rooms available for us to check into.  We insisted that it may be true that the rooms that had been occupied the night before were dirty and unavailable, but we had a reservation for the night before specifically so that we could check into our room in the morning...blah, blah, blah. Snippy desk clerk was completely unapologetic in telling us that there were NO ROOMS and we did NOT have a room to check into.  They had a note that we were arriving Thursday morning and they would not have a room for us until Thursday afternoon.  They'd sold our room out from under us and didn't care one bit.  I was quite ill-tempered about it.  About this time, I was fed up and having none of it.  The desk clerk did not like me one bit.  I talked to someone else, higher up or at the convention bureau, and that person assured me that the reservation arrangements I'd made should still be intact, and after she talked to the snippy desk clerk they miraculously found me a room, clean and made-up and available.  They guessed that the person I talked to about making the packages available had also modified the room reservation information, despite the multiple notes that we WANTED the room for Wednesday night even if we couldn't occupy it until Thursday morning.  Meanwhile Hal and some friends had rushed over to set up the booth, which they'd finally managed to retrieve from the hotel baggage locker.  In the hour before the hall opened to the public, they set up our entire display.  Record time!  Chris spent an hour or two in the room trying to "refresh" himself before he had to run a Freeport event.    Thursday booth duty was pretty constant; the booth was hopping and sales were brisk.  There were dozens of portfolio reviews, aspiring artists, editors, and writers wanting to connect, as well as fans stopping by to thank us or tell us how much they enjoyed our products.  As tired as I was, it was so refreshing to be in contact with all those enthusiastic people!  The hall is much larger than the Milwaukee venue, and well laid out.  There are multiple entrance and exit points to the hall, which means there are far fewer "bad" booth locations. Convenient hotels and attached food and drink venders that don't suck are also very much improvements.  Attendance is up, the place is crawling with people, and aside from out check-in difficulties, Indianapolis looks to be a resounding success so far!  Thursday night Chris and I were so tired we just crawled back to our room and died for the night.  We ordered room service and I fell asleep before it even arrived.  Woke to eat, fell back asleep, slept hard and felt much better in the morning.

      GenCon  Off to GenCon in a few hours.  I got my tickets through Priceline in an attempt to save some money.  I saved money, but wasted time.  I'm traveling on the red-eye flight that leaves tonight and takes me through Atlanta, where I have a layover and must switch planes before back-tracking to Indianapolis.  If we're on time, we touch down in Indianapolis an hour and fifteen minutes before the show starts!  I kept the hotel reservation for Wednesday night, so we can at least check in immediately and shower and change before we have to be at the hall.  Poor Chris has to run a game at noon Thursday!  Luckily, Hal will be arriving tonight and hopefully can pick up the convention materials and get things set up before the hall opens tomorrow!  I have to arrange with my hotel to allow Hal to pick up the packages that are arriving for me.  He'll need that stuff!  In other good news, my order of new Mutants & Masterminds t-shirts and plushy, blue Cosmo the Moon Monkey stuffed toys arrived and will be available at the con.  Hooray!  I may not be able to offer any new books for the game, thanks to late, late turnovers from authors and artists...but I can offer accessories aplenty.

      Tired, so tired  Whew, got home from San Diego last night.  As tired as the other moms are, I'm feeling doubly tired from the extra time we were there and the time spent on the convention floor at San Diego Comic Con.  Wowser, what a giant show that was.  After trying to go to the beach on Sunday, a bunch of us hit the beach yesterday morning before we left town, and the kids were just adorable playing in the surf together.  We had a long day yesterday, with going to the beach, back to Sheryl's to clean up, finding a UPS drop-off station to ship our convention display to Indiana, returning the rental car, then flying from San Diego to San Francisco, switching planes for the flight to Seattle, taking the shuttle out to pick up our car... started the process of 'going home' at 1:30 in the afternoon and didn't actually arrive home until 11:30pm.  Today I'll be washing clothes, repacking the suitcases, driving Kate up to her dad's, and then tomorrow night we leave on the red-eye flight to Indianapolis (with a layover in Atlanta!?!).  GenCon starts Thursday at 10:00am.  Hard to motivate myself to do anything... I desperately just want to lay around in my own bed.  Meanwhile, enjoy this picture.  It pretty much sums up Comic Con.  (I had my photo taken with the Tripping the Rift standees too, but this one is more entertaining.)

      San Diego Zoo  Oh my goodness, what a crazy time that was.  Taking that many tired, cranky, hot children to the zoo was very much like herding cats.  The San Diego zoo is big and impressive.  I definitely could have stayed there much longer and enjoyed it much more if I'd not been in a pack of two dozen people; I'm sure the other families felt the same.   Kate went back to the house with Sheryl and Mela and I headed over to Chris's book signing.  After the signing, we got on the list to have dinner at  urlLink Casa de Bandini  which was nearby the game store.  I have to say that the dinner wasn't particularly good, though the huge margarita was indeed huge. While the food was nothing to write home about, the company was exceptionally pleasant.  Sean Reynolds (and family) and Stan! joined us for dinner and it was a delight to see Sean again.  Sean's sister Carrie entertained us with stories of what it was like growing up with Sean while we waited for Sean to meet up with us (after he dashed home to pick up his lovely girlfriend so she could join us as well). Carrie and I had a geek bonding moment when she recognized my WWDN shirt for what it was.  Got back to the house much too late.  Sore and tired, even the shorter hours at the show today are going to feel long.  Then there's breaking down the booth and getting it out of there, which is bound to be a chore.  Tomorrow, home to Seattle, frantic clothes washing, and Wednesday it's off to GenCon.

      ComicCon, Day 2  Not much to report. It was a long day at the booth, punctuated by short bursts of activity.  Overwhelmingly, people came to either tell us how much they enjoy the books we put out or to ask if we were viewing artist portfolios.  Many, many people stopped to look through particular books.  The most popular books for browsing were Cartographica (our full-color book of maps) and Ultramodern Firearms, by far.    High points of the day were when Hal handed me a small figurine of Captain Chode from  urlLink Tripping the Rift .  Turns out neither Hal nor Rick were familiar with  urlLink Tripping the Rift , which Chris and I both loved, so it was delightful serendipity that Chode found his way to me through them. I also got to have a pleasant conversation with Aaron Williams of  urlLink Nodwick  fame in the booth adjoining ours, but wasn’t able to catch  urlLink John Kovalic  when he wasn’t extremely busy signing autographs.   Saw that the powers that be did not see fit to allow Stan! to move to a more populated area of the hall.  After the convention hall closed, Chris and I headed back to our hostess’s house, where a gathering of another sort was taking place.  Tonight was the night that the moms and kids from my e-mail list got together in one place.  We had three moms and six kids from Phoenix, a mom and three kids from Texas, two moms and four kids from San Francisco, plus our hostess, her child, and my family (plus one cat) all together in one house for a barbecue.  Margaritas were mixed, meats were grilled, tater tots were offered to kids of all ages, and boys and girls had sodas and corn chips to their hearts’ content.    Tomorrow I abandon the guys in order to join the moms and kids on a trek to the San Diego Zoo.  Chris has  urlLink a book signing engagement  in Old Town in the evening and he may just decide to stay in the city proper with Hal and Rick after all is said and done. I’ll be trying to do my share in taking care of minding my child and the children of my friends for a trip to the zoo since they’ve been wonderful about minding Kate for me while I’ve worked the convention the last few days.  Kate is certainly having more fun going to Legoland than she would be hanging out at the booth with me, or languishing in the on-site kid’s care room.  I alternately fear and hope that business will be brisk at the booth tomorrow.

      ComicCon, Day 1  I dropped Kate off with my mom friends, who took her along with them to the Wild Animal Park while I worked the convention.  Chris and I then found our way to the convention center, a little later than we had intended.  I did a drive-by and dropped Chris off and then made it to the booth about an hour later (which is how long it took me to find parking and then stand in line to get a couple of lattes and a scone from Starbucks).  Traffic by the booth largely consisted of people already familiar with our material who stopped by to tell us how they liked our books or how much they were anticipating some of the titles that have been delayed (like the cursed  urlLink Skull & Bones  project or the much anticipated  urlLink Crooks!  book).  At least a dozen people stopped dead in their tracks to fondle the  urlLink Ultramodern Firearms  book, which sadly we only have a few copies of.  Hal literally approved the reprint of the book at the show yesterday; we're down to just a dozen copies or so in stock until the reprint arrives.  Caught sight of industry pals Patrick Kapera and Steve Hough leading a pack of AEGers around the convention.  This is what they do for fun every year between working Origins and GenCon.  They stopped to chat for a bit and we commiserated about flakey freelancers and the grueling convention season and then they continued on their way to enjoy the sights.  I was released from booth duty in the afternoon and sought out our friend  urlLink Stan!  who is here with a table in Artist's Alley.  I searched and searched for his table, went back to the booth to look at the listing again, only to find out that poor Stan! was waaaaay off in the farthest corner of the convention hall, all by himself.  There he was, all alone, surrounded by rows of empty tables.  For rows and rows around him, none of the assigned artists had shown up to claim their tables, which meant that Stan! was sitting there all by himself, with no foot traffic whatsoever.  He'd asked if it was possible for him to move up closer to everyone else in the world, but hadn't received an official response from anyone in charge by the time I left him.  Free for the afternoon I darted up to one of the seminar rooms to hear authors discussing the process of writing and how it works for them.  Included on the panel were Vernor Vinge (author of one of the few hard science fiction books I've read and greatly enjoyed,  urlLink A Fire Upon the Deep ) and fan favorite,  urlLink Wil Wheaton .  There were a couple of other authors who were also very insightful and funny, but with whom I was entirely unfamiliar.  I can't recall their names off-hand.  After the panel, most of the authors dashed off to other engagements, but a line quickly formed of nerdy Wil Wheaton fans hoping to talk to him before his autograph session.  I joined the line. You see, I'd exchanged a few e-mails with Wil about gaming and some mutual friends in the industry, and I wanted to just quickly say hello so he could put a face to a name.  Fans beset the poor man before he could even gather his things and leave the podium area.  More than one guy wanted to talk to him about Star Trek, including one inconsiderate jerk who blissfully ignored the fact that several other people were waiting in order to "pitch" his Star Trek animated series proposal to Wil for his support so he could "do an end run around Paramount" and other self-important bs. Finally my turn came and I simply handed up my business card to Wil, intending to just say hello and dash off, to make myself as utterly unlike Mr. Inconsiderate as possible.  As I was reaching up with my card, Wil spoke first; he just wanted to say that he loved my shirt (yes, I appeared at the convention in full geek-wear, sporting a fetching Homestarrunner shirt).  As I thanked him, he looked at my card.  Wil's response was completely unexpected.  "OHMYGOD, YOU'RE NICOLE!? Wait, let me come down!" He dashed off the podium and onto ground level.  My brain began pinging like a pinball machine...instead of shaking his hand, I goofily hugged him.  PING PING... my internal critic screamed "PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER WOMAN!"  My stoic Finnish genes each individually cringed at my presumptuousness and over-familiarity.  PING PING went my brain. While I tried not to come off as a slack-jawed yokel, Wil continued to talk: he was excited to meet me, he'd gotten the package I'd sent him and loved it, he hadn't written to tell me so because he'd planned to look me up in person at the con..."Everyone in the game industry loves you," he said.  My poor little geek brain couldn't take it, "Nah, they don't love me, they *fear* me," I blurted, trying to be funny.  That comment fell like a lead balloon and smashed me in the foot, ouch!  "No, seriously, they love you. [Industry Associate] has had nothing but nice things to say about you."    I could feel the eyes of the room upon me, as every fan impatiently waited their turn.  This was not the anonymous passing off of my business card that I had planned!  Wil was just a enjoyable and familiar and geeky-cool in person as his online persona, and not only that but he was as excited to talk to me as I'd been to talk to him. I desperately wanted to be able to have this conversation in private, at my leisure, over a couple pints of Guinness somewhere.  Alas, it was not to be. Mr. Inconsiderate, still lurking around, hears Wil say that I'm a game writer and butts in, "Do you know So-and-so?"  No, I said.  "You don't know So-and-so?"  No, I don't, sorry. Feeling a bit claustrophobic, I blurted something to Wil about being glad he liked the package I'd sent, and that I'd come up to his seminar to meet him because I wasn't sure if I'd have another opportunity, that I was spending some time away from the convention with my daughter and I hadn't wanted to miss him, but that there were other people waiting so I should probably let them have their turns... My brain was still pinging, and I practically skipped out of the room, grinning like the smitten geek-girl that I am.

      ComicCon Setup  We're set up and ready to rock.  Met up with Rick and Hal yesterday, also ran into our friend Patrick, who used to game in our gaming group before he got married and he and his wife had a baby.  Haven't seen him in months.  Was great to see him again, even briefly.  He helped us haul boxes and things from Rick's hotel to the booth space, typical nice Patrick.  ComicCon is HUGE.  The boys were all geeking out about the various giant robot figures and other cool toys they saw in the aisles surrounding the Green Ronin booth area.  Several nice fans of our stuff have already stopped by in the 3 hours of "Preview Night" to say hello or to check out our new items.  We also had several talented artists come by looking for work, which Hal will be only too happy to give them.  Today the moms are going to the Wild Animal Park, but I don't know if I will meet up with them or not.  I have to put in my time at the booth and I'm not sure if I'd be able to get away in time, if they're planning on going "early".    Nothing else really to report at this time.

      Sea World  We spent 9 hours at Sea World.  Kate declared that it was the best day of her life, which is about as rewarding an exclamation as a parent can hope to hear from a child after such an excursion.  The day began with a 20 minute wait in line (after parking in the ass end of nowhere and walking the length of the parking lot to get to the gates) where loudspeakers blared at the assembled crowd not to forget they could swim with dolphins or dine with Shamu, if only they would pony up the money for such treasured "memories of a lifetime."  Kate was beside herself with excitement at the thought of swimming with dolphins, which was thankfully sold out before we ever reached the gates.  Instead, we agreed that we'd try the "dine with Shamu" option, which was also thankfully sold out by the time we reached the reservation tent.  Already set back over $100 (and that's with one adult admission at half price, thanks to Sheryl's coupon) we finally settled on an additional $30-something per person for their Cirque du Soleil show/buffet.  Now set back about $200, we were able to start our day of fun.  Kate understood we'd "spent an Xbox" on this, and that we weren't buying anything extra, and I stuck to that.  No cotton candy as big as your torso, no Shamu-topped $10 drinks that make whale sounds whenever you sip, no $2.25 per 1/4 pound candy, no "win a Shamu as big as your SUV" ring toss games.  We did break down and buy a $2.50 Pepsi in the heat of the day while we watched the Seal and Otter show, but that was it.  Kate was allowed to buy one keepsake, a stuffed otter, because we'd agreed that Sea World is where we would buy such a thing (as opposed to getting the first shiny bauble she latched onto when the plane touched down) and Kate dutifully examined all the different themed shops (should she get a penguin? a dolphin? a Shamu/Baby Shamu/Grandbaby Shamu?) before making her decision.  Aside from the one languid polar bear in the Wild Arctic exhibit, there weren't any disappointing exhibits.  We took a motion ride to the Arctic, which (while one of the lamest "stories" of such a ride I've ever seen) was entertaining enough for Kate, which made it entertaining for me.  Chris and I were amused when the woman in the prep video chided the room ("Shorts and t-shirts are not arctic attire!") and Kate dutifully put on her windbreaker and put the hood up.  We saw excellent exhibits of penguins, sharks, belugas, puffins, you name it. We caught the seal and otter comedy show, the performing Shamu show, the dolphin show. Kate was excited to sit in the "soak zone" and had even come prepared (thanks to uncharacteristic forethought by Mommy) with a swimsuit, a waterproof instant camera, swim shoes, and a change of dry clothes.  Then she saw the giant screen video of just how completely soaking wet people in the "soak zone" got and chickened out. At both the orca and dolphin shows she waited on the edge of the zone, got sprayed on her legs and ran squealing back to where Chris and I were enjoying our nice, dry seats.  Mission accomplished.  The Cirque buffet was alright.  The food was just fine, though I intensely disliked the fish entree.  Kate picked at some macaroni and cheese and ate half a hot dog, but was mostly interested in getting close to the sea lion they trucked in, or petting the dogs that were brought around to thrill the kids.  We were "entertained" by three grotesquely costumed women in neon feather boas, who sang a variety of mostly disco tunes (broken up with a little jazz) and then the Cirque performers did their thing.  I commented to Chris that when one joins Cirque du Soleil, one probably does not expect to be performing nightly at Sea World to an impassive crowd of children and vacationers.  Still they accomplished some impressive feats while we ate our fill and "got our money's worth" by having two desserts.  After 8 hours in the park, Chris and I were ready to go, but Kate desperately wanted to stay for the fireworks.  She'd been lamenting that she'd missed Independence Day fireworks this year (because she was in Canada with her dad) earlier in the trip, and I didn't have the heart to deny her.  She was awed by the display, kept saying Oooh, and Wow!  "That was SO GREAT!" she exclaimed repeatedly, still innocent enough to throw herself fully into the enjoyment of such things. I don't have much time left to enjoy her innocent exuberance and I'm glad we had the chance again yesterday.  After the fireworks, another Cirque du Soleil performance erupted on the stage just in front of where we'd positioned ourselves.  I held Kate up on my shoulders for that (blessedly short) performance and then we hit the road.  Mission accomplished.  Kate is likely to be very tired today.  She stayed awake for the whole ride home just to spite Chris, who predicted she'd be asleep within 10 minutes.  She is her mother's daughter, after all!  Rick arrives in a couple of hours and then check-in and set-up for SDCC begins.  Hal arrives this afternoon, just in time to come work the booth for "Preview Night" from 5:30 to 8:30.  I'm nervous about the show, having never exhibited here before.  I'll be glad to finally see what it's like so I can have a better idea what to expect.  The unknown aspects of this show make me edgy.

      San Diego, Day 2  Sheryl dropped us out at the airport so I could pick up my rental car yesterday afternoon.  We took a shuttle to the Alamo location, where we waited in a huge line for at least 40 minutes.  This particular Alamo location was crowded, filthy dirty, and had multiple broken auto-check-in kiosks. I did not like the look of the place, and it didn't get any better the longer I stayed there.  I chose Alamo because I've rented from them before in LA and San Francisco, and because they have a policy allowing the use of debit cards for renting cars, which means I can use my PayPal card.  I like using the PayPal card because I can consolidate my money from other credit cards or from debit cards onto it, instantly. It's got the MasterCard logo on it, but I can also use it to draw out cash, like any other debit card.  Except this particular Alamo rental location insisted that they could not accept my PayPal card.  They didn't even try to run it, they just saw the PayPal logo on the front and they refused it.  The manager backed up this craziness.  He told me that it "wasn't a major credit card" (despite the MasterCard logo on it) and ALSO refused to accept it as a debit card, even though there was a clear debit card acceptance policy posted on the wall behind him.  I said, "Even if you won't accept it as a credit card, you have a posted debit card policy.  This card works like a debit card!"  "Ah," he says, "works LIKE a debit card.  Works LIKE a debit card.  It's not actually a debit card!"  It was like we'd stepped into bizarro world.  I told him that I'd rented cars from Alamo with this very card, recently, in California even.  He just looked at me and said that whoever had accepted my card should have been fired.  I was open-mouthed in disbelief.  I suggested that he inform someone at their corporate headquarters that they should update the policy on their website, since I had a standing reservation that said nothing about not accepting certain cards from certain issuing companies.  We then reached an impasse.  I had purposefully moved all my money and available credit for this trip onto the PayPal card.  I had no other cards, debit or credit, to offer them!  Chris was with me, and Chris had money on two different cards, but then we ran afoul of another of their bizarro rules: the name on the credit card and the name of the driver have to match.  Since Chris does not drive (lived in NYC, took the subway everywhere, has never learned to drive) they still would not rent us a car where I would be the driver and Chris would pay.  The clerk called the neighboring rental car location: Airport Rent-A-Car, and they came to pick us up. While I waited, I called PayPal on my cell phone and asked what was up with the card not being accepted.  They were as shocked as I was, had never heard of such a thing before.  The woman said, "Surely it wasn't a manager that said this."  Oh but it was! She was amazed and assured me that my PayPal card is a "real" card and should be accepted as a credit card for any transactions.  She gave me a number to call if I ran into any further difficulties, and confirmed with me that there is plenty of available money on that card. I sense a steaming mad complaint letter in Alamo's future.  Back at the ranch, we were dropped off at the neighboring rental place and there I saw a couple other people who had been waiting in line at Alamo. This place was shady. Oh, did they mention their computers were "down" and they had to do everything by hand?  While I was there waiting for the girl to finish my transaction, the phone rang twice with people calling in to complain about their rentals ("I paid cash last night and you charged me way more than I thought it was going to cost!").  It was like one of those check-cashing locations, or those places that give loans to kids with bad credit for 30% interest, but I didn't have another option at that point. I got in the car and got out of there as fast as I could.    Once we got away from Shady Rental Cars, I started to enjoy San Diego almost immediately.  We drove up to Balboa Park, but by this time it was after 4:00pm and I wasn't sure what hours things were open.  We stopped for a small snack, since everyone was starving, and then decided to take a drive out to Coronado Island.  We also drove down the Silver Strand, then back up again.  We stopped at the beach and let Kate run off some energy.  She begged to play more, but I was starving.  We walked over to the Hotel del Coronado, which was very cool.  Decided against eating at their fancy restaurant on the theory that Kate wouldn't like anything.  She's not nearly the fan of raw oysters that Chris is.  We ended up at a nearby seafood place instead, which was perfectly fine (and mixed a tasty margarita).  Since there was still a little light out, we drove back into the city and up to Old Town, where we scoped out the location of Chris's book signing on Saturday and kept Kate entertained by walking around the various shops and historic buildings until it was dark and time to call it a night.  Today is Seaworld.  Tomorrow Rick and Hal arrive for ComicCon, as well as our convention display.  We have a few hours to get set up and then they've got a preview event happening tomorrow night. That's when the real work begins.

      San Deigo, Day 1  Sheryl picked us up at the airport about 6pm yesterday. Mela and Kate hit it off immediately.  We drove over to Sheryl's house, where Janeen and her boys were waiting, and then Sheryl grilled up some dinner for us. We'd flown from Seattle to San Francisco, then changed planes and continued to San Diego.  On neither flight were we offered any food, so we were all pretty hungry!  The kids all played together and Kate hauled out her new Disney music CDs and they had a dance party.  Meanwhile The adults sat out on Sheryl's little patio and talked.  It was very pleasant.  Shery's putting us up in her house for the duration, and Kate and Mela had a nice sleep-over together (though they apparently wandered around the house eating apples at midnight! I completely missed that, being dead to the world myself, but Chris caught them).  Later this afternoon I'll go pick up the SUV we're renting and then make good on my promise to take Kate out sight-seeing.  I think we'll save Sea World for tomorrow, but maybe I can find something else she'll enjoy today.  We're joining the other moms and kids (most of whom are arriving Thursday night) for a trip to Legoland Friday.  Wednesday work on getting set up for ComicCon begins.

      Truck Go Boom  I had to pick Kate up this afternoon from her visit with her dad so we can take off for San Diego in the morning.  I got on the road about 12:30 or maybe a little after, intending to meet up with Kate and her dad at our usual exchange spot at about 2:00pm.  No sooner did I round the curve that obscured my line of sight to Seattle's University District when I noticed an immense, ominous black cloud roiling over the horizon.  I had no idea what it could be or where it was exactly.  The further north I drove, the more the location of the cloud shifted around, depending on which way the road bent.  For a while I thought it was a building fire, or maybe something happening on the water near the university, but I drew closer to those locations the cloud was still hanging in the distance.  It reminded me very much of the ominous cloud that hung over  urlLink Mount St. Helens  during the eruption in 1980.  Finally, when I realized from just how far away I was able to see this black cloud, I called Chris and asked him if he could turn on  urlLink Northwest Cable News  and see if they were reporting anything.  Sure enough,  urlLink they were!   As Chris and I were talking on the phone, the tanker was still actively exploding and burning.  News teams already had live pictures on the air, but it couldn't have been happening for more than 20 minutes.  I continued to work my way north, following the freeway, until I saw traffic ahead of me slowing, and then I took the first exit and started inching my way up highway 99 with hundreds of other diverted drivers.  Thanks to Chris, I knew how far to go north on 99 before I'd be able to turn back to I-5, but it was still a long, tedious drive before I got back on the now-nearly-empty freeway and continued north.  I took my time turning around to make the trip south, as I'd confirmed with Chris that I-5 was reportedly closed in both directions.  By the time I did head back to Seattle, the south-bound lanes were open again and I got a stunning look at the wreckage.  There had to have been a dozen fire trucks, plus a foam-spraying truck still spraying the now burned-out wreckage of the tanker truck.  There were also at least 30 police cars, dozens and dozens of rescue workers of various stripes milling around on the freeway about a quarter mile further south from the charred remains of the inferno.  The concrete all around was completely blackened.  The damage was massive.  Kate, peering out the back window for a look at the accident site, was very concerned about the driver.  She kept saying, "I really hope the driver of the truck got away.  I hope the driver didn't die."  Amazingly, it turns out he walked away with just a scratch!  This is the second time I've been in relatively close proximity to something blowing up as I've made my drive back and forth to shuttle Kate to her visitation with her dad.  The last time was when I was driving through Bellingham just moments after the  urlLink Olympic Pipeline explosion , that killed a man and two children in 1999.  I hope to stay very far away from any other explosions in our region in the future!

      Mr. Mumbles  There are two post offices that I use on a regular basis.  One is the post office where our PO Box is located, the other is the post office nearer to my house and more convenient if I'm doing other errands like grocery shopping or stopping at the drug store while I'm out.  Yesterday I took two large bins of mail to the post office, and I got Mr. Mumbles.  Mr. Mumbles gives me the creeps, but he was my only option.  If I have a single package or a quick interaction with Mr. Mumbles I'm fine, but the longer I have to hang out at his station, the more uneasy I am.  As you might guess, Mr. Mumbles mumbles.  It's as if his running internal dialog comes spilling out of his mouth if he has to open it to talk to a customer.  Each and every action he makes is accompanied by an indistinct commentary, reminding me a little of Billy Bob Thornton's character in  urlLink Sling Blade . The mumbling usually sounds something like, "Ah, well, let's see, got a book in here, yessir, going to Mississippi Canada? Oh, Mississauga. Yep, that'll need one of these green fellas here, I see you've got that filled out, that's good, one pound six ounces, air mail on that one [stamp stamp].  Here we go.  Another book, zip code 55739.  Media mail, we'll move that bugger over here..."  When I have something like 30 packages to process, it means a loooong running commentary, most of it not directed at me.  When a comment is directed at me, his tone and inflection don't seem to change at all, just mumblemumblemumbleDoYouWantAConfirmationWithThatmumblemumblemumble.  It's unnerving.  Not nearly as unnerving as when he tries to make chitchat, though, which is what happened this time!  Because I was sending packages to Canada, I was treated to a nice little diatribe about how "the Canadians are the worst."  I wasn't sure what he was getting at, and responded with a neutral "Oh?"  He let loose with a rant about how the Canadians don't allow guns up there, and so an American tourist was killed outside a bar for $100, and the Canadians just shrugged it off like it was no big deal.  (How these things are related, he never made clear.)  He goes up to the Okanagan with his buddy and they're all killing each other with knoves and baseball bats.  Now I was definitely not going to mention that I'd lived in Vancouver for 4 years and saw no such thing, but I did say, "Huh.  I thought the Canadians were generally peace-loving sorts."  This led to a further rant about how they're not only up there killing each other with baseball bats, but now that they have "all their free pot" it'll only get worse.  He then told me, in the most clear-spoken manner I've ever heard him use, that the Chinese are the only ones who know how to deal with drugs: kill the drug dealers along with the addicts!  Ha ha!  That'll take care of it!  I nervously told him that the book I was mailing to the guy in the military (somewhere in the middle east) was a book about the Old Testament, took my receipt and scurried away.  This fellow is a walking sterotype of the kind of guy you'd expect to "go postal" and start shooting up the place when he finally snaps.  ::shudder::

      Yaaarr.  Running a company where our flagship product is a fantasy pirate port city, it's only natural that we'd want to go see  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean  right away. By the time we'd put in enough time on current, pressing projects tickets for all but the late shows were sold out.  I chose to buy tickets online at Fandango for one of the theaters on the east side, and that left us enough time for a light dinner before the show as well.  The credits had no sooner come up on the screen than young guys around the audience started making "Yaaarr" sounds.  Lots of teenagers packed our theater, and they all seemed to be into the experience.  Of course, Pirates is a Disney movie, so one does not expect too overly much characterization.  That's fine with me, I knew it going in.  Orlando Bloom, barely recognizable from his stint as Legolas in the Lord of the Rings movie, acts the part of the earnest blacksmith with a heart of gold, smitten with a woman above his station. Keira Knightley, who I only recently saw in Bend It Like Beckham, plays your typical fiesty Disney heroine, motherless daughter to a doting, dim-witted governor.  She's enjoyable enough in the role, pretty and incredibly petite.  She holds up well in all the wet-underclothes scenes she's forced to endure, and that's about as racy as it gets, so it rates well on the "family fun" scale.    But it's Johnny Depp who really shines in the movie and gives it any lasting "character" at all.  I have a feeling that the part of Captain Jack Sparrow was originally conceived as a much straighter role than Depp eventually played it.  I can definitely imagine it being played by a young Harrison Ford-type, ala Han Solo, the sly rogue who gets away with murder through a combination of raw skill, balls, and luck.  Depp brings a much wackier interpretation to the role and it really works to give the film (a weird) energy.  Chris and I were both commenting on how Depp's characters really are different from film to film; he doesn't fall into personal clichés (like "Oh, John Travolta is playing his 'cool guy' character again," or "Oh, it's Al Pacino as Al Pacino...again.") and his portrayal of Ed Wood is different from Edward Scissorhands is different from Dead Man is different from The Ninth Gate.  Seeing Depp in Pirates makes me wish all the more that I could have seen him in The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.

      Maxin' and  Relaxin'  Both Chris and I noticed that after taking an actual "weekend" last weekend (instead of doing as we normally do, which is to putter around with work-related stuff no matter the day of the week) we both felt rejuvenated and able to tackle our jobs with renewed vigor when Monday morning rolled around.  One of the things neither of us is very good at is drawing the line between when it's time to work and when it's time to rest.  Now, obviously, some of what I need to do on my personal time (cooking, cleaning, banking, shopping) isn't exactly "rest" but it's a fact that taking a break from work, and especially taking a break from the drudgery of gaming-related message boards, e-mail lists, and websites in my "off hours" gives me a mental break that I definitely need and don't always take.

      Productivity  Managed to get a lot of things crossed off my list from yesterday, though getting caught up on laundry still hangs undone over my head.   * ship convention display to convention center [decided to haul this to the convention center ourselves] * have stock shipped to Hal's hotel [need to decide what we're bringing!] * send special requests (such as copies of Testament for special review) [packed and ready to mail in the a.m.] * fill pre-orders for any books that arrive before we leave [ditto, through today] * pick up my prescription that's been ready for 5 days [oops....] * solidify GenCon travel arrangements [done!] * book my Dragon*Con hotel [done!] * catch up on laundry and dry-cleaning! [eek...] * put new shelves in garage and move as much as much stock as possible out of the house [hrm, shelves still in back of car.  oh well, tomorrow...] * pay bills! [must deposit paycheck!] * renew car insurance! [see above] * mow the lawn [my nice neighbor did half my front lawn for me yesterday!  sweet...] * set up automatic sprinkler (lest everything that isn't dead already die while we're gone) [this will be a challenge]  I also finished putting all of our product specs into the new web store (product IDs, images, weights, etc) but the program continues to thwart me.  Made calls to customer service for both my credit card processor and the makers of the shopping cart program; no answers as yet.  Still trying.  Upgraded our car rental for San Diego to an SUV, to better enable us to haul our own display to the convention center.  Tracked down our California Reseller's permit, which needs to be displayed at our booth or we're not allowed to check in! Found out one of the authors for one of the Big Secret Projects we've been planning all year now can't work on it because he took a design job at Wizards of the Coast, and Wizards (specifically a couple of guys in particular, those backstabbing weasels!) won't allow him to do it.  Processed half a dozen more demo team volunteer agreements. Worked up my vision statement for what I hope to accomplish in my new volunteer position.  Oh, and then I watched a couple of hours of Law & Order while working on crossword puzzles, and ate cheesy bratwurst from Uli's.  Yum, meat and cheese.  Not a bad day.  Now I just need to wring about 5 more just like it out of the rest of the week.  And then I get to enjoy a day or two of San Diego sights with my little girl before we start the convention treadmill again.  Whoopee!

      The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  John, Chris, and I went to see the theatrical release of the restored and remastered  urlLink The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  today in the U District.  Absolutely awesome movie.  I'd seen it before, but I'm sad to say that all those  urlLink Clint Eastwood  as Cowboy Badass movies all run together for me and I often can't remember which of my favorite scenes goes with which movie.  Anyway, seeing this classic up on the big screen again was a blast and had me smiling for the rest of the afternoon.     Clint Eastwood as Blondie is ultra boss as the badass,  urlLink Eli Wallach  is unrecognizable and the real star of the movie as Tuco, and  urlLink Lee Van Cleef  utterly succeeds as the meanacingly handsome, sneering bad guy "Angel Eyes."  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Chock full of good stuff, and great to see in all its big screen glory.  After the movie, John led us on a stroll down the Ave to Ruby's for lunch (seared yellow-tail sandwich with avocado and spinach for me) and then back up the Ave to Twice Told Tales for some used book browsing and then to the coffee joint next door.  "Coffee and pinball" they advertise, but the real treasure of the back room was  urlLink CRYSTAL CASTLE !  Crystal Castle was one of the only video games I played devotedly, back in my middle school years.  Mike Groff and I spent a great deal of time at the video game nook in the Clackamas Town Center playing this game with some of the others in our junior high talented and gifted class, like Derek Liebertz and Dagny Haug.  Seeing a working model of this game was strangely nostalgic for me; I couldn't bring myself to play it, in case it (like so many things of my youth) did not live up to the memory.  Chris was not so daunted and played Bentley Bear through three levels before falling victim to the vicious gem eaters and the evil bees.  Just like old times.  We accepted an invite from Ray & Christine to join them at their pad for dinner and screening of Ray's recent purchase: the first season of  urlLink King of the Hill  on DVD.  Ray's only just decided to take the plunge into King of the Hill, and though I've seen the episodes before, I still found myself laughing out loud aplenty.  We also watched a good portion of  urlLink Undercover Brother  (user comments on IMDb say "Better than the preview makes it look" and I agree) while Ray and John went outside like manly men and grilled some lamb burgers, corn on the cob, and toasty buns.  Great way to end a sunny, sociable weekend.  Came home feeling very relaxed and full of meat.

      Independence Day  Had a lovely, sunny, sociable day yesterday.  Attended a potluck at Sue and Monte's house and chatted with many old friends and acquaintances from Chris's Wizards of the Coast days.  Talked and ate and talked and ate and talked some more.   urlLink Stan!  was there, telling some of my favorite "Stan stories" from his days in Japan (He was telling the Beans story in particular, a classic!  Tammie and I agreed that another favorite from that cycle is his panties in a jar story, and my personal favorite is "My dog has stress!").  Chris entertained twice in one day with his story about being slashed in the neck by a lunatic in New York City, and showed off his scar.  Keith told a truly horrible (though entertaining) story about a former employer's utterly clueless insensitivity over Keith's prosthetic arm.  We watched a couple of games of  urlLink Time's Up , which looked like an entertaining game.  The teams seemed to be having a lot of fun.  Julia Martin and I commiserated for quite a while over the trials and tribulations of website maintenance in the game industry.  It was a perfect day for a 4th of July barbecue.  After about 6 hours of potluck, we bid our host and hostess adieu and made our way up to Jess and Kathryn's party, already underway in the heart of Seattle.  There we enjoyed mingling with the usual suspects (Evan, Rick and Sasha) and folks we know in common through Wizards of the Coast or through Jess and Kathryn's other parties.  Much more eating, drinking, and loud music ensued until we all piled out onto the balcony to watch the fireworks.  Post-fireworks several party games of  urlLink Truth or Dare Jenga  and  urlLink Guesstures  went on, ending only when an 8 round boys-against-girls game ended with the boys going down in defeat, unable to guess Chris's pantomime of "left-handed" or someone else's pantomime of "necktie".  Sasha and I bonded over not being "girly-girls" after Kathryn and her girlfriend dashed off to the bedroom together in high excitement over figuring out that they both owned the same dress, or when two party attendees exclaimed over their mutual admiration for a particular shade of nail polish.  Funny stuff.  Had a great time, got to bed waaaay too late, but it's summer and Kate is at her dad's so what the hell.  I'm going to enjoy myself while I can.

      Kate Wins!  Forgot to report, Kate won the Harry Potter coloring contest from the night we attended the midnight Harry Potter event at Barnes & Noble.  Kate is with her dad in Canada for the next two weeks or so, but I went to pick up her prize for her so she can have it when she gets back (and before we go to San Diego).  This is no small prize!  She got the  urlLink Wizard Craft Book  and Kit.  It's a full color book of "wizard crafts" plus a kit that includes a 5 x 7-inch slateboard, a foam ball, white polymer clay, a wooden dowel (undoubtedly for making a wand), gold and silver paint, gold and silver glitter, copper wire, glue... if you know Kate, you know this is right up her alley.  The girl is always making something.  I'm impressed that she won the contest since there was a lot of competition that night.  Of course, with the frame of mind I'm in lately, I find myself wondering about the criteria for the contest, how it was categorized, who made the decision, what the competition looked like. On what basis did she win?  I've obviously been thinking too much about the Origins Awards.

      Why am I awake?  Since returning from Columbus and its crazy time zone, I've been up way too early every morning.  I think had I not received the call about the website being hacked my second night back, I might have been able to reset my body clock that day, as I was sleeping soundly when the phone rang.  Instead, I was up for the day, and it's been me popping awake at 6:00 am every morning since.  I'm so tired, but after 6:00 am (or 5:30 this morning, yuck!) I just toss and turn in the bed.  Might as well get up.  Am attending a potluck in the afternoon and a party this evening.  No idea what I'm bringing to the potluck.  Guess I have plenty of time to figure that out this morning.

      Cranky    Remember what I said about being all calm and shit? Well *that*'s over.   I'm so bitchy right now I recommend no one else cross my path today.   One of the things I hate worse than anything else in the world is being blamed for something that I didn't do, or being assumed to be secretly acting badly when I haven't been. I was appointed head of a committee last week and before I've even received the files from my predecessor I'm already the target of a campaign of innuendo from a certain person in this industry who really ought to know better. Since this person engaged in a personal campaign to ruin my life (by ruining the life of my loved one -- including and up to meddling in a non-work issue by bringing it TO work and trying to exert influence to have my loved one formally disciplined if not fired...) I have NEVER trusted a word out of his arrogant, self-serving mouth. That he would now try to take his agenda to the public as if I wouldn't consider it (not that he even brought it to me directly) in an attempt to curry enough support from the random internet "public" to bully me into doing what he wants... well, let's just say I've spent a lot of time that I can't afford to spend trying to minimize his efforts to sabotage my position before I even start!   There are only a few people I've worked with that I wish lingering harm and misery on, but this bastard is one of those who I wish would just disappear, or that he would get his comeuppance and suffer even *half* the suffering he's inflicted on others. I've said many times, he has no soul, nor any moral conscience. If having children working in a sweat shop would increase the profitability of his product (and weren't illegal) he'd totally do it! If it's "legal" he doesn't care one bit about whether it's moral. If it's "good for business" that's all that matters to him. Why he fights so hard here, in the game industry, where the stakes are SO small, is beyond my comprehension. Surely there's some Bush/Cheney conglomerate out there taking advantage of some desperate third world people that he could attach himself to, and leave the rest of us out here alone, scrambling to make tens of thousands of sales and earn a gold star from our peers.

      Hoo boy!  People in Columbus kept telling me how generally relaxed I seemed.  This is their cautious way of saying "Gee Nicole, you're not nearly the stressed out bitch we remembered/you seem online."  This is ok, I don't mind.  It's true!  I think one of the reasons I was able to be relaxed and mostly pleasant at the show this year was that Chris was so completely stressed out, that I naturally flowed into the yin to balance out his raging yang.  The yin in not usually where I reside, but there's only so much yang to go around.  Hal and I joked that with the state Chris is in lately, we might say "Hey Chris, we need to get a new credit card machine," and it's as if he heard, "Hey Chris, we need an immediate cash outlay for a solid gold, jewel encrusted credit card machine.  Oh, and ivory back scratchers are on sale too!"  Poor guy, too much on his plate lately, and he was just not sleeping well at the hotel at all, which only made it worse.  I could have been much more stressed out about the lead-up to the Origins Awards, but I was not allowing myself to be sucked in.  I let the people who said they were going to handle it do so, and when I felt my blood pressure rising over the several ways in which I felt the thing was not going according to what little of the plan I even knew...I simply excused myself from the process.  No such luxury next year, but I also don't intend to let things go until the last possible minute as they apparently were allowed to fester this year.  We will have programs, scripts, and speakers lined up in advance!    There is a certain aspect of having Kate attending the show with me that keeps me grounded.  Oh sure, I still get tired, cranky, irritated or what have you.  But I noticed the same phenomenon when we took Kate to New York City.  I normally despise New York: it's filthy, it's crowded, it's violent.  The traffic sucks and people beep their horns uselessly--I hate that kind of thing and always have.  I got into trouble with one of the neighborhood moms when I was maybe 5 or 6 for responding after about the 12th time she screamed for her daughter, "She's not over here, so why don't you shut up?!"  I'm only marginally more tactful now, but about the 5th time the cabbie beside me lays on the horn, when traffic clearly isn't going anywhere, I certainly *want* to yell the same way. I love Chris's friends in the NYC area, they're all great.  I enjoy the restaurants and museums, and can appreciate that there's no Katz's Deli anywhere else.  But New York makes me tense and anxious and prone to fits, except when Kate was around. Instead I can enjoy it through her eyes, laugh when she's the one wishing aloud that the cabbie would stop beeping his horn, turn what would be my anxiousness about the filthy streets or the crowds or which subway station we want into a more benign, motherly concern for Kate.  Having Spike, Mary, and Miranda Jones along at the convention makes it a lot easier to accomplish.  Future cons in future years may not be as easy-going, if I have Kate and she has no playmates to enjoy while I'm working.  I hope they can keep coming, as it's great to see them and also fun to let the girls (who are like twins, except for living on opposite coasts and being born 6 months apart) hang out together.  My patience was pretty well at its end by the time I got on the plane to come home, though.  Our flight wasn't scheduled to leave until 8:10pm Columbus time Monday.  This meant we should, in theory, be able to go out and enjoy the sights of Columbus before leaving town.  I arranged to have a late check-out, which the hotel agreed to. This meant we could meet Hal, Chris, and Tanith for breakfast before they left town.  Then we packed up the room and brought everything down to be either shipped or stored.  The one problem was that we couldn't get the UPS labels to print using the hotel's computer, for the longest time.  After FINALLY getting the woman who was hogging the computer to let us use it, the printer wouldn't work and the guy who could fix it was out to lunch.  After we FINALLY got that taken care of, I told Kate we could go back to COSI so we could show Chris all the cool things we discovered there earlier in the week.  Except that we got the cab driver who didn't speak English and who didn't know anything about the town.  Instead of driving us, late as we were, over to the Science Center (COSI), he drove us over to German Village to KOSSUTH STREET.  When I finally realized what was happening, he couldn't understand what we wanted him to do.  Finally we spied Schmidt's Sausage Haus looming in front of us, so we gave up and jumped out of the taxi, and headed over to Schmidt's for a quick lunch.  Chris had a sausage, I had a spatzle salad, and Kate had a chocolate cream puff half the size of her head!  We successfully called another taxi and were finally taken to COSI, which was due to be closing in 90 minutes.  They let the three of us in for fifteen dollars total, since we had almost no time.  We're not even finished putting our wrist bands on when we're accosted by COSI employees who invite Kate to take part in a paper airplane making contest.  Over 35 minutes later, we extract ourselves from this fiasco, and now have just less than an hour to try to see the cool exhibits.  Managed to drag Chris to see most of the things we saw on our previous visit, but it was definitely not a fun trip to the center for me.  Got back to the hotel, which was serving snacks and complementary drinks.  A couple dixie cups of Merlot later and I was suddenly SO TIRED.  Unfortunately, there was still the matter of getting all our luggage to the airport, and so Chris called a taxi.  We made it to the airport and as we were checking in we were told that flights into St. Louis (our connection city) were delayed, but that the plane we were catching was also delayed so everything was fine.  They issued us boarding passes and assigned seats on both flights and we checked our bags and went to the gate.  I was so exhausted, I fell asleep for an hour on the floor in a corner.  The flight to St. Louis was all of an hour long, up and down again.  The plane we were catching was at the neighboring gate (yay!  not like Dallas, where we had to run from one end of the airport to the other.).  We go to catch the plane to Seattle and they won't honor our boarding passes.  They tried to split us all up, with the three of us sitting all over the plane.  They did the same to another woman, traveling alone with her five boys!  I was pissed.  I was too tired to complain enough to be thrown off the plane or anything, but I was NOT impressed, especially since I had been assured not three hours before that everything was in order with the flight to Seattle and that we had three seats adjoining.  Luckily for me the flight attendants rearranged some passengers and by the time we were up in the air, Chris had switched with someone and he, Kate, and I were in the same row.  The mother was moved to sit in front of me, two of her boys were across the aisle, one in the seat behind Kate, and two others somewhere else altogether. Exhausted, we all slept as much as we could, and arrived back home after 3:30am (East coast/body clock time).  Since I'd been up since about 8am Eastern Time, it was a hellish long day and I was oh, so glad to be home.  Falling asleep in front of the computer writing this, so it's clearly time for me to turn in.  Will try to write better entries until the next of the major convention trips (San Diego in something like 13 days).

      DragonCon 2  Well, they're here!  Leaving the hotel this morning, the streets and shops were swarming with convention attendees. Girls in plaid skirts, girls in devil horns, girls in renaissance costumes, girls in Star Wars rebel fighter costumes, men in long scraggly ponytails and chainmail shirts, guys in kilts and combat boots, people wearing DragonCon t-shirts from previous years.  The local news teams were on the street filming news clips, undoubtedly reporting something like, "Well, it's started again: DragonCon, when the freaks descend on downtown Atlanta.  Today we get to see if anyone will actually find our booth (off in the corner) and, once they find it, will they buy?  Lunch yesterday at the Pacific Rim Bistro, very near the hotel. Exceptionally good pan Asian cuisine. I had an Ahi tuna, pineapple, avocado salad that was wonderful.  The boys had tuna tartare that I tried.  Could have eaten two portions of that.  Last night's dinner at Tiburon Grills was excellent!  Kobe beef skewers as appetizers, oh my.  Swordfish poached with shrimp and artichoke hearts, honey-lacquered duck (with stilton grits and portabello mushrooms), peach pork tenderloin (with pole beans that Hal raves about).  Hal and I split a piece of peanut butter pie, and Chris had a warm bread pudding with rum sauce and we rolled home.  YUM!

      Atlanta  Haven't spent much time in Atlanta in the last ten years. A couple of quick trips through town on my way somewhere else, or a trip to DragonCon. It's been very pleasant to be back.  In town with Chris and Hal, we've been able to move freely around the city, checking out places to eat and shops.  It's been relaxed so far, as we got in a day earlier than we needed to due to a booking snafu.  Totally worth it.  Most of what we've done is eating and wandering.  The first night we took off for Greek food in Buckhead, which ended up being a $40 round-trip car-ride (with that in mind, Hal rented a car the following day).  Even though it was a Tuesday night the place was hopping!  We were severely under-dressed for  urlLink Kyma  but we were treated with absolute courtesy and had a fabulous, hilarious, personable waiter for the whole meal. The octopus was so delicious and tender I ordered a second course of it before the first was even devoured. Main courses of lamb and fish were unbelievable.  Since we had a car,  we took off for  urlLink Atlanta Cyclorama  which was very cool and very much up Chris's history alley.  We stopped at a restaurant called  urlLink Six Feet Under , which was VERY cool and very much the sort of place we all would have loved to hang out at home, if we had a place like it.  Our hip. friendly waiter was impressed that the boys were wearing Boss Hog and Mission of Burma t-shirts, and we had great fun and great food.   Last night, having a car, we chose a new "far away" restaurant to try, since we could drive to it.  Again, thinking that it was only a Wednesday night, we didn't think to make any reservations, so we ended up at a VERY crowded  urlLink Eclipse di Luna , where a live four-piece jazz band (ala Squirrel Nut Zippers) played in the corner.  Waiting wouldn't have been a problem, but the bar was particularly crowded and a truly spectacular thunder storm whipped through, drenching everyone waiting outside and people who were sitting on the open-wall porch.  Once we finally were seated, we ordered up six tapas dishes and a pot of delicious paella to share and had yet another stunning meal.  SO GOOD.  Slept terribly, but the boys were very sweet and handled booth set up while I stayed at the hotel and caught up on some work.  Things start for real tomorrow.

      Baby Shower  This afternoon I went to a surprise baby shower for a friend who is five weeks from her due date. It was great fun to go shopping for baby items for her, and really made me nostalgic for my own pregnancy.  I was the only mom at the party, which gave me a unique perspective on things.  I am afraid I talked too much about my own experiences, but I tried to give reassuring stories to even out some of the jitters that our friend was experiencing.  Many duplicated items were bought, despite all of the attendees shopping off the gift registry.  Babies R Us did a terrible job of updating the registry as we bought our items, I guess!  Still, one can really never have too many  urlLink baby bath towels , and  urlLink duplicated mobiles  and whatnot can be returned for other items on the list (especially since we all dutifully provided our mom-to-be with "gift receipts" for just such an inevitability).   One item missing from my friend's list was a  urlLink Boppy .  Not knowing if it was intentionally left off (because she already has one or because she's decided she doesn't want one for some reason) I was loathe to buy one for her, and since the party was a surprise I didn't want to ask outright.  Aside from the  urlLink baby sling  (which I found to be a wonderfully handy, impossible to do without item) the other item I got when I had Kate was a nursing pillow (now widely available under the Boppy brand name).  I can't recommend the nursing pillow highly enough to my pregnant friends, though I didn't actually have a Boppy-brand pillow myself.  Several of the childless attendees were commenting on how many  urlLink things  you  urlLink "need"  to have to have a baby. It's true, there are many items out there that make baby-tending  urlLink safer  and  urlLink more convenient !  I was marvelling at the advances in "baby gear"  urlLink technology  that have sprung up in just the 7 years or so since I was a new mom.  And there's no denying there are things you need to have, like  urlLink diapers  and  urlLink car seats .  But I'm reassured by the fact that I had my baby when I lived in a two-room apartment, when her father was a graduate student and I was an unemployed spouse. It's possible to raise a happy, healthy, well-adjusted child on so much less than it seems! I'd forgotten how  urlLink overwhelming  and demanding it can all seem until I walked into the Babies R Us store and saw all the  urlLink cute ,  urlLink soft ,  urlLink colorful ,  urlLink adorable ,  urlLink useful  items.  Tam was saying she felt like she wasn't prepared (meaning she didn't have a stock of diapers or wipes or baby shampoo) but honestly, with all the love she has to give this little girl, their two pairs of arms to hold her, a blanket, and a milk-delivery-system (be it boob or bottle) is all they   need   and they have that much well covered.  They're going to be fine, and I'm so thrilled for them.  Unfortunately, Tam arrived looking pale and just got paler as the party went on.  She'd come down with something yesterday and had been to the emergency room with a fever and chills.  As the afternoon wore on, it was obvious that she wasn't feeling well again and in the end we urged her to go home and get comfortable and rest! It was unfortunate timing for a baby shower, but everyone there was there because we love her and we weren't put out a bit that she didn't feel up to a prolonged event.  I hope she didn't push herself too much!  Your 8th month of pregnancy is not when you want to become seriously ill.

      Ripped Off!  Spent the day so far working on getting my money refunded after someone got his hands on my debit card number.  (For those keeping score, this is the same card I used to rent my car at Sleazy Rental Cars on my trip to San Diego, where they kept a physical imprint of the card and all my information. I blame that.)    Happily, many of the transactions were already either declined outright or reversed by the merchants, who realized something was up.  Still, it's pretty interesting to see the pattern of his wanton theft: $60 to host a website (cancelled), $340 in purchases at Polo.com (trying to get in on their "Spend $300, get free shipping" deal, I'll bet.  Too bad it was declined!), $35 for Russian MP3s, $280 for access to porn MPEGs sites (refunded), $160 for a round-cut, multifaceted diamond ring from QVC, shipped to Texas (refunded and turned over to their fraud department), $211 for items at Gamestop.com (exposed as fraud by their internal controls and never shipped to the address in Pennsylvania) and, my personal favorite, $165 to 1-800-Flowers for a 14K gold diamond and sapphire pendant and a card that read, "Maryanne, I love you and I will always love you.  Don't worry, we'll get there."  That was going to be shipped to Garland, Texas.   Yeah, honey, I just need to defraud a few more people of their money so I can stock up on Polo shirts and porn, and we've got it made!   Cancelled the card promptly yesterday, which means I'm without it for my upcoming DragonCon trip next week. So far it's been a week of near-misses (where things that could have been really bad just turn out to be grand, time-sucking annoyances) but nonetheless the stress has caused my TMJ to ratchet up a notch again on top of everything else.  Am probably going to drive down to Oregon and back tomorrow for a short visit with my mom.  She's offered to help me get caught up on some database creation and data entry while I'm away at DragonCon and then my grandmother's memorial in Minnesota.  I'm going to bring the materials down there, have a short visit, and head back tomorrow night.  Thanks Mom!!

      Spam, Bank, Car, Mortgage, Sweat  Have been getting tons of echospam and notes from people telling me they "can't open the .PIF file I sent, could I resend it as a Word Doc," or chiding me for sending them spam/viruses.  Someone who had all of my e-mail addresses (home and the various permutations of my work addresses) was clearly infected with  urlLink the new worm going around . In addition to getting the spam messages from infected computers myself, I'm doubly spammed because of the bounce messages and people who think I've done the spamming.  Lovely.  Also got a note from my bank: a couple weeks ago I was charged my yearly fee for my safety deposit box, a fee which I completely forgot was coming.  Taking that fee out of my account caused the account to go into the negative by $12 or something (add to that the $25 insufficient funds fee) but since I put my paycheck in the account right afterwards, I didn't notice the problem and went on to pay my bills as usual (mostly through electronic bill-pay and automatic deduction). That's all pretty safe (if there's not enough money in the account, auto-pay just doesn't make the payment instead of cutting a bad check) but there are a couple of places that just refuse to get with the program and insisted on having actual paper checks mailed to them. Fine!  Except I had something like $75 less in my account than I thought I had because of the incident with the safety deposit box ...and that started a cascade of bounced checks and overdraft fees.  SHIT!  I haven't had something like this happen in years and it really sucks.  Put off taking the car in yesterday so that I could get a few things done before losing its services again.  The clang turned into a full-blown shimmy and frightening "rattle" (at least "rattle" is what the mechanic called it... more like a car-quake!).  Because the car was acting up so badly, I decided it was best to skip going out at all last night, and so missed hooking up with some friends at the Zig Zag.  I didn't want a repeat of Saturday night's pathetic call from the roadside.  Took the car in again today for a "minor adjustment" and then caught the bus back to my neighborhood, but had to sprint up the hill because I was missing the appointment with our notary (see below).  Today was the day we were signing the papers for the refi of our house.  Taking advantage of the low mortgage rates, we've managed to refinance three percent off our interest rate since we first bought the house.  Excellent!  But this morning, the finance company called to confirm our appointment for closing, then some woman called up a few hours later to tell us she was the notary assigned to our case but she'd never gotten the papers and so our closing was "canceled."  What?!  I had to run out to go to the post office, drop some paperwork off before a deadline passed, go to the bank, and still make it to drop the car off for repair, so I didn't wait around to get the full scoop.  Turns out Watermark didn't know who this woman was, but our actual notary was indeed coming by at our scheduled time!   Good grief .  Raced back for the meeting and was very late, but the notary was good-natured and had been hanging out with Chris, talking about World War II.  Tonight is game night, so I expect people to be arriving in a couple of hours, which means I'd better get off my lazy, sweaty behind and get  back  down the hill to catch the bus back out to the repair place if I intend get home and fulfill my obligation of providing dinner for the group.  Jess returns tonight, having missed the last two weeks due to a boys-only vacation out in New Jersey.  Am very curious to hear if he has any entertaining stories about getting caught in the blackout.

      Home  Guy from the garage called back this afternoon.  Halfway through the repair on my car he discovered that the part he'd had sent over from the Ford dealer had a faulty gasket, so he had to call in an order for another one, and I won't see my car again until tomorrow.  Am making glorious progress cleaning, sorting, and uncluttering. I may actually get all the suitcases emptied and stored before I have to haul them out again for the September trips. I have agreed to put out charitable donations of clothes and household goods to benefit  urlLink Community Services for the Blind  next week, so I'm taking this opportunity to wash and sort a lot of clothes and clear out Kate's outgrown school items from last year. I give to Community Services fot the Blind on a regular basis, especially Kate's outgrown things.   urlLink Big Brothers, Big Sisters  also gets some of Kate's things on occasion.  It's been nice to be home!  This is the longest stretch we've had at home since convention season began. I've been steadily sticking to my meal plan and putting all the good food we bought on our return to use.  In addition to the blueberry/lemon trifle I made for Chris's birthday dinner, I've made turkey cheeseburgers, roasted corn salad, fresh greens with tomato-balsamic dressing, a fresh fruit salad with mango, banana, apple and grapes in a lime-honey-mint glaze, grilled turkey and provolone sandwiches with pesto-mayonnaise. Tonight I tried a new recipe that claimed to be "Shepherd's Pie" but aside from the mashed potatoes on top had nothing in common with  urlLink actual Shepherd's Pie .  It was more like chili with potatoes and cheese on top, but good nonetheless.  (It just wasn't Shepherd's Pie.)  All this cooking and the counters are sparkling, the dishes all done and put away!  I rock.  Sadly my success inside the house hasn't carried over to the outside of the house; it seems that the two trees along my fenceline have died!  One is almost completely bare of any leaves at all, the other has all its leaves but they're all prematurely brown and dead!  I've had no problems with those trees before, but after my neighbors in back and to the side built and painted their fence (and their side of my fence where the yards overlap, the same fence where my trees were) I noticed a problem developing with the trees and bushes.  I also seem to have lost a lilac bush and the raspberry vines I planted on that side, though the blackberry is just barely hanging on.  I have to wonder if something in the paint got into the soil or something!  Very sad.  I'll be sadder still if they're permanently dead and haven't just done dormant.  I'm still clinging to the hope that they'll rebound next year.

      Insomnia  Asleep after midnight, awake at 4:30am.  After laying awake for over an hour, I've given up and am quietly surfing the web from my laptop.  I'd leave the bedroom altogether, and get some work done or something, but the humidity of the night has stuck my bedroom door shut.  If I were to force it open, the resounding crack would disturb my sweetheart, sleeping here peacefully.  So I touch-type my way across the world wide web, in the dark, listening through the open window to the sounds of my hard-working immigrant neighbors leaving for jobs unknown.

      S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y Night!  Joined Ray and Christine, and friends Bill and Chris for dinner and games, to celebrate Chris's birthday.  Ray and Christine whipped up veal and hand made pasta and sauce for dinner, and I contributed a lemon and blueberry trifle.  Dinner was divine, a couple abortive attempts at playing games of Trivial Pursuit were made, and we all eventually settled for watching a TiVo'd episode of Queer Eye For the Straight Guy.  Oh my god, I laughed so hard.  LOVED IT!  Kate and her dad made a cameo appearance, as they stopped by to say hello and exchange some of Kate's things on their way to the airport.  Kate and her dad leave for vacation in South Carolina tomorrow morning.  After dinner and Queer Eye, Bill and Chris left, and shortly after that Christine retired, but in the meantime we'd been joined by Mr. Tynes so we hung out for a little while longer anyway. Fun was had, but eventually we decided to call it a night.  On the way home, about halfway between our two places and in a not-very savory area, my car suddenly lost all power and stalled out.  I coasted through the intersection and into the parking lot of a 76 Station that also houses a repair shop.  Not open at 2:00am, sadly, but at least I wasn't stranded out on the street.  No sooner had I rolled to a stop in the gas station parking lot than I was accosted by a woman offering to help, she could use her card to buy me gas if I needed it.  I assured her I was not out of gas.  She pressed me to accept her "help," saying she'd "just left her old man and could use the money."  I declined.  I saw her rooting around in the nearby dumpster not long after, and then she disappeared into the night.    The car was not making "Your engine just blew a rod and is seriously screwed" noises, I had electrical power and the engine was turning over, but not igniting.  I took that as a good sign, and sheepishly called Ray's house (having just left a few minutes earlier) to see if he or John could come rescue us and bring us the 2-3 miles through the unsavory neighborhood that stood between me and my home.  Bless their hearts, they both jumped into Christine's Land Rover and drove to our rescue.  I hold out hope that the repairs on the car won't be too outrageous and that I can get someone to look at it first thing Monday morning.  Meanwhile, tomorrow is definitely a stay-at-home day for me.  There were things around the house that needed doing anyway...

      Blackout   Nikchick.com was caught in the blackout that swept the east coast, hitting New York and New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Ontario, Michigan. No blogging for me last night. Back up this morning and no worse for wear.   My friend  urlLink Rob  writes about being in the midst of it, out in New York City, trying to get back to his home in New Jersey, trying to make sure his wife was ok. This is the same friend who was at Ground Zero two years ago, he and his wife on opposite ends of the block, with flaming wreckage and destruction between them, neither one sure that the other was ok.   My night was much more enjoyable. Rona worked on me for over an hour and during the process my ear, which had felt plugged up from the same moment my TMJ acted up, unplugged and while my jaw is still sore and cranky, it's much less painful. I was able to fully close my mouth for the first time in a week, and was able to chew without pain. I had a cheese burger at The Ram to celebrate, talked to my mom on the phone, and then joined Chris and Rick in Renton, where they'd stopped for dinner after an abortive trip to the game store.

       urlLink Justin's Journal    These are some badass baby photos of me. When you have kids, you'll wish they looked so fly.   Justin Achilli joined  urlLink White Wolf Game Studio  long after my day, in what I then referred to as the "third wave."  I have no idea what wave they'd be up to at this point, but Justin is still soldiering on and is a White Wolf Old Timer as far as most industry folks are concerned. I definitely give him his props for that.  I find reading Justin's journal and his retellings of antics past and present to be wildly entertaining.  He's a one-man emotional thrill ride; the mom-half of me cringes and tsks ("You're going to put out an eye!  Your liver, what about your poor liver?") and the middle-finger-to-authority, punk part of me cackles with vicarious glee at his debauchery.  I once told him, after he posted some scathing, hilarious come-back on some industry mailing list or another, that posts like his were one of the only reasons I remained subscribed.  I've said "Yeah, boy!" to his posts often enough to feel like a game industry version of  urlLink Flava Flav .  And now he's even hitting my mother-half where I live, by posting baby pictures to his blog.  Really, if nothing else, you've gotta check out the baby pics.

      TMJ  Still having a flare-up.  Looks like I'll be sticking to things I can nibble with my front teeth, and lots of liquids.  Chris brought me some pizza tonight, with the crusts cut off so I could gingerly eat the gooey parts.  I've been researching different possible treatments that don't involve breaking my jaw or capping all of my teeth.  Moist massage, aromatherapy, acupuncture, craniosacral massage, chiropractic manipulation...  I have no idea where to begin, but my usual coping techniques of Advil or Acetaminophen with Codeine and a couple of beers hasn't gotten me back to normal.

      Back!  Just back from a weekend in Vancouver, where I spent a little time with my sweet girl.  Won't see her again until my ex-'s dad drops her off with me at the end of  urlLink DragonCon .  ::sniff::  I like my adult time, but weeks on end without seeing her is tough.  Arrived in Vancouver late because of heinous traffic, road construction, multiple accidents, and a rain storm!  A trip that usually takes 2.5 hours took 5 on Friday.  Kate's dad dropped her off with me at my favorite Vancouver restaurant,  urlLink Tojo's , where we got a table on their outdoor balcony and enjoyed Tojo's Tuna, Tojo's Baked Oysters, Tuna Tataki, and the Golden Roll (among other things). Kate devoured some miso soup and an Avocado Roll (aka Tojo's Roll, no wasabi). Stopped at the nearby  urlLink London Drugs  for some snacks (including two large bags of  urlLink Spitz  brand sunflower seeds, which I can't find in the US) and drinks to take back to the hotel.  Saturday we rolled out of bed and straight downstairs to the  urlLink White Spot  restaurant attached to our hotel.  Slow service, typical White Spot food, but it was good enough (except for their coffee, which is really bad).  Then off down Oak Street to meet up with  urlLink MacBin .  We brought him some of his comp copies of books he's worked on recently, as well as a box of Legions of Hell to use for prizes for  urlLink H.P. Lovecraft's Birthday Party , and a big ol' check for more of his recent work for Green Ronin.  He helped us get in touch with  urlLink Vertigogirl  and Theo, as well as former Stamp's Landing cohort Evil Jeff.  We confirmed that we'd show up for dinner at Vertigogirl's pad and got directions, then Kate got her wish and we went to  urlLink Science World  for a few hours.  While there we saw an  urlLink OMNIMAX  presentation of a film called  urlLink Whales , and poked around some neat exhibits.  (Having been to several science museums recently, I recognized several popular educational doodads from other museums and avoided those in favor of the exhibits that make Science World unique.)  Dinner with Kate and Theo was a nice break from the chaos of Science World, but I was severely overwhelmed from too much driving and flashing lights and crowds of people.  We'd barely sat down to dinner when I had the worst attack of  TMJ  I've had in years!  I don't usually have TMJ symptoms that affect my ear, but this time I immediately felt like my ear canal was suddenly "stuffed up" almost like the sensation of pressure change when in a plane that's taking off. As of tonight I still can't bring my back teeth together when I close my mouth, can't apply enough pressure to chew anything firmer than a hotdog, and even that much pressure must be applied gingerly.  It's the opposite of my usual TMJ symptom, which is that I can't open my mouth more than about an inch and can't bite down with enough force to even take a bite out of a sandwich, but it's affecting the same troublesome joint that has always caused me problems.  I had very little to eat (one burrito and half a piece of cheesecake), even though it was quite tasty.  Kate ate about 1/2 a tortilla and some cheese, and when I said she needed more growing food before she'd get any chocolate cheesecake, she reluctantly ate a bit more cheese and two Triscuits.  Two bites into the cheesecake she was complaining about not feeling well.  I sent her to the bathroom to wait and see if her stomach would settle, and she'd no sooner told me she didn't think she was going to throw up than she DID vomit her poor little guts out.  Very sad.  Kate was heartbroken, she'd been so looking forward to seeing the  urlLink Celebration of Lights  Grand Finale fireworks that night.  I didn't have the heart to take her straight back to the hotel, especially when she wasn't feverish and didn't seem to have continuing problems with her stomach.  I've noticed that sometimes when we travel, or when we've had a very busy and exciting day, Kate is sick that night, enough to vomit.  I don't know what it is, but I've noticed the connection, so I suspected Kate wasn't "sick" in a contagious kind of way.  Nonetheless, I was not going to take her down to the beach in the cold night air to stand with the masses of people (millions expected) watching the fireworks close-up.  Instead, I agreed to park up on a hilltop park in my old neighborhood where I'd watched the Celebration of Lights the years we lived in Vancouver.  You can see most of the fireworks, except for some of the particularly low ones, and though they're at a distance they're still pretty.   Took some Tylenol PM for my TMJ-aching jaw when we got back to the hotel, and slept hard until late this morning.  TMJ was still acting up, but at least I was rested.  Kate seemed fully recovered as well.  We met the gang for dim sum at  urlLink The Pink Pearl  in East Vancouver, and Evil Jeff brought his whole clan along with him, including his girlfriend and her two delightful girls, who hit it off with Kate very nicely.  The dim sum was good as usual, though I had to pass on many of my favorites, like the squid and the Chinese broccoli, because there was no possible way I'd be able to chew them in my condition.  However, my consolation prize of egg tarts and mango pudding was yummy!  After dim sum, Theo and Vertigogirl left us, and we joined Jeff and family and friends at their house for a few hours.  The girls played together until we had to leave.  I could have stayed later but had given MacBin a ride and needed to get him home for an appointment.  Kate was having so much fun that she really fell apart about leaving, which is hasn't been her M.O. lately, so it took me by surprise.  We coaxed her out of it fairly quickly, dropped MacBin off at his appointment, and then spent several pleasantly sunny hours on Granville Island enjoying the sights and smells (and some tastes!) of the market in particular.  After Granville Island closed up, Kate's dad agreed to meet us at the park near-ish his house where Kate had suggested we go to kill more time.   After handing Kate back to her dad for the rest of the summer, I decided to go ahead and stop for dinner at another old favorite,  urlLink Rasputin  (the Russian restaurant).  Cabbage rolls to die for, the Best Potato Salad in the World, perogies, peroshki, some chicken and dumpling soup that was divine, even a pint of Czech lager that totally hit the spot.  There were gigantic pieces of pastry and tiramisu visible on the dessert table, but I was stuffed with enough excellent Russian food that I couldn't possibly have eaten a bite of dessert.  As it was, I feared I might not make it all the way home, between the food coma and the general fatigue.  Stopped just across the border for gas and bought a sugarfree  urlLink Red Bull : tasted like cough-syrup-flavored soda, but no denying I felt peppy enough to drive home without stopping.  Tomorrow it's back to the grind, but at least I've fortified myself with some Kate suggles and potato salad.

      The Machine Takes Over  Recently I've received several long messages on my voicemail that appear to be from someone's cell phone. Lots of background chatter, people talking and laughing, but no one speaking into the phone.  "Ah, someone sat on their cell phone again," I thought.  Last night I'd given Ray a call about the ZigZag and hadn't reached him.  Figuring it wasn't worth bothering to leave a message about, I didn't.  His cell phone, however, had a much different opinion on the priority of my call!  It called me back, apparently all of its own accord!  Since I have Ray's cell phone number programmed into my phone, when he calls, my phone tells me it's him.  "Ray's cell" called me while I was driving home last night, and yet, when I answered, there were only the familiar sounds of people talking, laughter, and the "shhhka, shhhka, shhhka" sounds of someone with a shaker shaking up some sort of icy, boozy beverage.  Shouting "HELLO? HELLO!!" into the phone got no response.  Chris did me a favor and called R&C's house to see if they were home.  They weren't.  I called Ray's cell phone back, but was kicked over to his voicemail again. No, the cell phone was just determined to mock me, to tempt me with the knowledge that somewhere out there laughter and cold beverages were being enjoyed...but not by me!  Ray called the house when he got home and got Chris's message, and this is when I found out that his cell phone has been routinely calling random numbers, not even numbers that he has programmed into his phone (such as my new cell phone number).  Apparently it went on quite a tear the other day, calling out 11 times over the course of half an hour or so, without Ray's knowledge.  Wacky!

      Listen to the Professionals  Mr. Tynes is so, so right in suggesting that I need a chance to unwind at the  urlLink ZigZag .  From some fluffy reviews they quote on their website: "From the steps outside, the warm glow illuminating the Zig-Zag's windows and the soft chatter of diners and drinkers on the patio welcomes, and walking through its double doors is a sweet relief."   Indeed!  Sweet relief is just what the doctor ordered.  Not to mention that I dig a place that will tell you, in addition to listing their cocktail and food menus on their site, that they will call you a cab anytime, that no firearms are allowed in their establishment, and that they use raw eggs in their Caesar salad dressing all in one concise list.  After today's out of office meetings, and dinner at Ivar's with friends from out of town (and their kids), I will just happen to be conveniently located to waltz myself over the few blocks to "sweet relief".  Who wants to join me?  You're all invited--unless you've recently blown your deadlines for me.

      Crash  Well, it's happened.  I've pushed myself to much this summer and now I've crashed.  I'm frayed, I'm tired, I'm extremely cranky.  I have people pulling at me from all directions.  I started to list off all the things that people want from me, but honestly, I was going to start crying about it, so I stopped.  Today I spent two hours going over a behavioral questionaire for a study my daughter is enrolled in, dealt with the stupid people who are in charge of our waste management, spent two hours hand processing credit card orders and banshing my head on the keyboard because the people who took these credit cards for us at GenCon did NOT collect the information that I told them was VITAL for processing the cards (such as, oh, names, and expiration dates...), found the reports some of our authors have been bugging us about for a month (regardless of the fact that I've been everywhere *but* here this month), went to open them and found them corrupted, crashed two machines trying to simply PRINT a couple of simple spreadsheets with no more than two dozen data points...and that's just the first 7 hours of my day so far.  I'm done.  I'm fried.  I hate everything.  I want to quit.  I'm not saying anything to anyone, because the next e-mail I answer is likely to be full of "HOW DARE YOU PILE ONE MORE FUCKING THING ON ME YOU SELFISH BASTARD," or "WHERE IS THE GODDAMN TEXT/ART/BOOK/WEB CONTENT I FUCKING PAID FOR, YOU BITCH?!" or "STOP VIOLATING MY COPYRIGHT/TRADEMARK/PRODUCT IDENTITY/BRAND YOU ARROGANT GOOD-FOR-NOTHING WEASELS!!" or "I'LL GET AROUND TO 3.5-UPDATING THAT BOOK THAT'S BEEN OUT FOR TWO YEARS WHEN I HAVE TIME AND NOT A MOMENT SOONER; WHY DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO YOU BOTH FREE AND INSTANTLY?!" and that's just not good for anyone.   Times like these, I just want to take a flamethrower, burn everything to the ground and start "fresh" because there seems little hope.  Hope of what?  Can't say...little hope for anything.  Ugly, ugly evil mood.

Thursday we have another out-of-office meeting with the design house we're collaborating with to produce our hottest property.  Meanwhile, Project X and Project Y, lingering in a state of perpetual "almost finalized"-ness, continue to move forward at a glacial pace.  This doesn't even touch the usual pile of post-convention "Why haven't you answered my e-mail?" e-mails, backlogged orders, and projects in motion.

      How Not to Watch a Movie, Nicole Style  Went to see  urlLink 28 Days Later .  Very good!  Spooky, plausible, visually interesting.  Remarkably satisfying for what I expected to be a zombie flick.  urlLink Naomie Harris  was excellent, in particular.   Unfortunately, I chose to see it in the theater with the World's Most Uncomfortable Seats.  About an hour into the film, I was really uncomfortable, suffering twinges in my lower back.  I tried scootching down in my seat so that I could hitch my knees up against the empty seat in front of me, but even that was not ideal.  And every time I shifted my weight at all, a woman in that row jerked like I was giving her an electric shock.  Finally she whined to her male companion, in a voice I swear she borrowed from my seven-year-old, "They keep kicking the seat!"  HE then swung around and in an irritated, demanding voice said, "Could you STOP KICKING the seat?!"  Now, first off, I was not "kicking" the seat. I did not mean to irritate this couple (there were only three people in the whole row in front of me) but I really didn't appreciate being *commanded* to stop irritating them, as if I were an unruly child, especially when all I was doing was trying to find a comfortable position. If they'd asked me nicely, or at all discretely (instead of barking at me) I would have had much more sympathy.   I retorted that I was not TRYING to kick their seat, and rearranged myself so that I was not touching the seat back for the rest of the film.  I eventually had to just stand up in order to be comfortable. (We were in the last row, so thankfully this was possible.)  I watched the rest of the film with this nagging irritation, both from my inability to find a comfortable position and because I was irritated about the way the couple had treated me.  I was ESPECIALLY irritated when, at the end of the movie (after the credits and the alternate ending had been shown) Mr. Bossy Boots had to wake up his girlfriend, who was now fast asleep!  I'm soooo glad I suffered along in an uncomfortable position for half the film so that Precious wouldn't be disturbed while taking her little nap!  (How she could sleep in those damned uncomfortable seats is beyond me.)

      Micky Fricky Blue Angels  Turns out our house is right on the main flight path for the various air-show fliers performing for Seafair here in Seattle.  The first year I saw the Blue Angels flying formations over the house, I thought it was pretty cool.  Yay, free seats!  This year, though, it's beyond annoying!  In years past the fly bys did not take place every few minutes for hours on end.  The endless rumble of jets, the constant chattering of window panes and glassware, the additional irritation of propeller planes cruising by our house as if in the midst of a WWI dogfight (I swear all that's missing is the dakka dakka dakka), all in the middle of the day while I'm trying to work at home.. it's too much!  I just witnessed a mom out with her little girl in the park next to our house.  The girl, maybe four, was climbing to the top of the kiddie climber when three Blue Angels buzzed past, particularly low-flying and loud.  The poor girl stood quaking at the top of the climber with her hands over her ears until her mother had to retrieve her and walk home with the girl trying to burrow into her mother to escape the noise!  I can't tell if it really is that much worse this year, or if I'm just noticing it more this year.  Either way, it's cutting into my ability to concentrate on anything!  Please let Seafair be over SOON!  They've flown over five times in the time it took me to type this blog entry!

      Holy shit.  Though I had a few lazy updates of my own to post today, I just read this account of what's going on with a friend of mine and it's wiped everything else from my mind. Can you believe this crazy shit? (Names removed to protect the innocent.)    5 weeks ago our house was burgled and the robber took K's computer. That same night our weird neighbor who never comes out of his house came out of his house to throw dirt clods at our bedroom window at one in the morning and call 911 to tell them there was a gang rape going on in our apartment.   A week ago, we were awoken at 2:30 to someone knocking on our bedroom window, then an hour later riging our doorbell, then an hour later pounding on our bedroom window again. We called the cops and when they came, they saw our neighbor, naked, running back into his house.   Yesterday morning at 5:00AM he woke us up again by hurling shit at the side of our house, smacking our window with a garden hoe, and throwing a giant abalone shell at our window. Again, when the cops came, he ran back into his house and refused to come out, but he did call 911 and report a rape in our house again. When we got home last night (so this is the same day) he was on our porch and started staggering towards us. We drove off, he didn't leave and kept coming at our car. The cops came and arrested him. We looked around in our house to find he'd put his checkbook under our door and that he'd left K six voicemail messages telling her he was coming over from 10:00AM to 5:00PM that day. In the process of looking around his house, the cops discovered K's computer, a bunch of her checks (which we hadn't realized he'd stolen), a check of hers he'd made out to himself, and a pair of her underwear.  So, I have a psycopathic next door neighbor obsessed with my wife and rapes in my apartment who's in jail now but they have no idea how long they'll keep him. And while this is happening, I'm trying to finish up our game to go out to Microsoft by next Monday.    That is just wrong and scary.  I've been stalked before in my life, had strange guys following me around and one guy who actually broke into my house to hide under my bed or in my closets. I totally feel the sick, creepy fear all over again just reading their account.  Please, please let this guy do a good long stint in jail and/or a mental institution where he'll be off the streets and maybe, just maybe, get his mental problem dealt with.  I mean, he's clearly got mental problems, right?  He won't just be released to return to living next door to my friends, right?  ::shudder::

      Patriot Act  I'm shocked.  Shocked, I tell you! Who ever could have seen this coming?   urlLink Justice department using Patriot Act in nonterror cases   So, when, on the Justice Department's Patriotic website (beautifully named  urlLink LifeandLiberty.gov ) they wax rhapsodic about the great strides in law enforcement brought about by the Patriot Act ("The USA PATRIOT Act: Preserving Life and Liberty  (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism) "), the fact that they reference  terrorism ,  terrorists , or  terror   41 times  on the front page alone isn't meant to reinforce with the public that the Patriot Act is all about  urlLink stopping terrorism .

      School Board Elections  Who cares, right?  Well, I just spent the morning meeting with one potential school board candidate and all of a sudden I care about the Seattle School Board election!  A mom of a fourth-grader from my daughter's school hosted this brunch and Q&A with  urlLink Brita Butler-Wall .  The attendees included parents of current and former Seattle school children here in the south end, teachers from my daughter's school and the nearby high school, school bus drivers, a labor activist, the president of our school's PTA, a former Seattle School principle and activist, and others I didn't have a chance to meet or chat with.  There are many issues before the concerned parents of kids in the south end of Seattle: the lack of a public  urlLink alternative middle school , the  urlLink  negative impact of the WASL  tests (passing the WASL is to be a requirement for high-school graduation in 2008), the district's  urlLink $35 million "shortfall"  and questions of where money went under the tenure of  urlLink Joseph Oleshefski , the fact that we currently have  urlLink no superintendent , the utter chaos surrounding the AP/SPECTRUM classes for students termed "advanced learners,"  urlLink allegations of grade tampering  in area high schools,  urlLink junk foods  being sold in schools and the school district's  urlLink contract with Coca Cola , the increasing reliance on  urlLink funding from corporations  and the business sector to keep public schools running, not to mention the  urlLink disarray  of the  urlLink No Child Left Behind Act  and other "soundbite" mandates of its ilk.  By pressing NOW for an alternative middle school to be made accessible to the children in the south end of Seattle, we might be able to see a program in place in time for the start of my daughter's sixth grade year. The current school board is inaccessible, suspect (how in the hell does an unexplained $35 million dollar deficit appear with no one held accountable?) and have been unwilling or unable to meet the needs of the children in this area.  If you are a Seattle reader, please consider voting in the upcoming election for Brita Butler-Wall and the other "opposition" school board candidates:  urlLink Irene Stewart ,  urlLink Sally Soriano  and  urlLink Darlene Flynn .

      The Chance for Peace  This morning, returning from dropping Kate off at school, I found myself stopped at a light behind a car with a very wordy bumper sticker:   Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed - Dwight D. Eisenhower   'Wow,' I thought to myself, 'that sums up the sentiment that I was trying to get across in my September 11th blog.  I wonder what the context of that quote is.'  So, when I got back home I fired up Google.  I discovered this quote is a small section of a larger speech titled  urlLink The Chance for Peace  and given by Eisenhower in 1953.  Fifty years ago.  As this was well before I was born (in fact, both of my parents were young children, younger than my daughter), I struggled to place the speech in context.  With more Googling, I nailed down a few additional  urlLink World Events : Eisenhower was sworn in as president, Queen Elizabeth was coronated live on television, Stalin died and Nikita Khrushchev was confirmed as the First Secretary of the Communist Party, Ayatollah Khomeni began the fight against the Shah in Iran, Pakistan declared itself the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Korean War was winding down, while the Cold War was ramping up.  The bumper sticker quote is from this larger passage.  Upon reading it, I find it doubly relevant to the United States today:  Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway. We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.   This speech, made 50 years before my silly blog, says better what I'm still trying to form into thought and deed for myself.  For each  urlLink $50,000 garbage truck  we buy for Iraq, we join in  urlLink the ban on family planning  for the AIDS-stricken African continent. Nearly half a trillion dollars (that's $477 Billion, with a B) in  urlLink tax cuts  for the wealthiest 1% of Americans, meanwhile  urlLink 35 million Americans live in poverty  over 12 million of them children. And for me, this extends to daily life in the United States as well.  We're using  urlLink more energy , and  urlLink more water , and it's not even fair to count the consumption per capita when we consider the poor and the increasingly destitute (say, for example, our Native American populations and the  urlLink conditions of the reservations ).  Also in the Chance for Peace speech, Eisenhower lists off the following "clear precepts" which he says govern the United States and its conduct in world affairs:   First: No people on earth can be held, as a people, to be enemy, for all humanity shares the common hunger for peace and fellowship and justice.  Second: No nation's security and well-being can be lastingly achieved in isolation but only in effective cooperation with fellow-nations.  Third: Any nation's right to form of government and an economic system of its own choosing is inalienable.  Fourth: Any nation's attempt to dictate to other nations their form of government is indefensible.  And fifth: A nation's hope of lasting peace cannot be firmly based upon any race in armaments but rather upon just relations and honest understanding with all other nations.  In the light of these principles the citizens of the United States defined the way they proposed to follow, through the aftermath of war, toward true peace.    Reading over those clear precepts, and looking at the path we're on at the moment, I'm sorry to say that I do not seen the United States on the path toward true peace. Increasingly, I feel a call to make a difference.  If we had this "chance for peace" 50 years ago, how is it that we've ended up here?

      Marrakech  Yesterday was supposed to be game night, but one of our guys is out of town all week on business, and another has parents in town helping him prepare for the impending birth of his daughter, so we were at loose ends when game time rolled around.  I'd planned to cook up something scrumptious from the bounty of fresh vegetables I'd picked up at the farmers' market Wednesday.  The farmers' market is in its last few weeks of traveling around the city, and will only be setting up across from Kate's school for another week or two, and this week it was bursting at the seams with fall goodness: pickling cucumbers and fresh dill, fresh peppers of all shapes and colors, tomatoes from cherry to beefsteak in reds, oranges, and yellows, huge bundles of fresh basil, okra, onions, the first of the fall squashes and pumpkins, the last of the summer peaches and pluots, a vendor selling salty oysters just plucked from their ocean beds at $5 a dozen.  The bread baker knows us (Kate buys a heavy round loaf of honey wheat every week), the tart-maker knows us (Kate buys a cookie there every week) and the cheese vendors know us (Kate samples their cheeses and then picks the same mild gouda every week).    Instead of cooking last night, the remnants of the game group decided to get together in J&K's Belltown neighborhood and have dinner together.  Kate suggested sushi, but Wasabi was packed with people when we walked over. We got the idea to try the nearby Marrakech (see this review from the  urlLink Seattle Weekly ).  It was glorious: round, leather pillow-seats around inlaid tables, bench seats backed with pillows, dim lighting from ornate sconces, fabric on the walls and ceiling all give the impression that you've stepped straight into Morroco. The waitstaff is appropriately costumed, you select your own bread from a large basket that's passed around, your hands are washed before and after the meal by your server pouring warm water from an ornate silver pitcher over an equally-ornate basin and there is not an eating utensil to be found.  The food was delicious, and (of course) we had the Royale Feast, so we got to try quite a sampling!  We overheard the thrilled, soft-spoken owner telling another guest that the restaurant has only been open for two months, and it's packed every night, reservations-only on weekends.  I have no trouble believing that.  Of course, stuffing ourselves on delicious food while in a warm, cozy, dimly-lit restaurant, resting on pillows and cushions nearly wiped us out and we all barely staggered the two blocks back to home or car afterwards.  I fell asleep early and slept soundly, full of couscous, lamb, and Moroccan wine.  Today Kate has a field trip to the zoo, where she hopes her class will bump into Kathryn (who was just hired as the zoo's marketing manager).  It would be quite the brush with celebrity for the second-grade class, at least as far as Kate is concerned.  Tonight we join a friend for dinner at his brand-spanking new house, and tomorrow Kate is looking forward to a sleep over with friend Celia.    I'll be taking a mountain of orders to the post office, and then planting an assortment of bulbs in preparation for spring flowers.  I also bought a medium-sized rhododendron and a more hearty lilac and I'm going to try again with the yard shrubbery that failed so spectacularly this summer.  Wish me luck!

      Nothing for All  I've been considering writing a couple of essay-style entries on subjects that keep percolating through my brain: my thoughts on forgiveness, what the soundtrack of my life would be, M.'s ongoing struggle with her alcoholism and how it affects her friends and family, my friend's little girl and how the poor thing has been diagnosed with  urlLink trichotillomania  over the last year...  Instead, I'm extremely busy with things that I've let languish all summer and I have no time to write anything thoughtful.  I'm still thinking over all these things and more as they pop into my consciousness throughout the day, but I don't have the time to write anything insightful or interesting  about the situations or my thoughts on them.  I ran into this problem with my paper diaries over the years as well.  The more interesting or unusual or thought-provoking the happenings in my life, the less I wrote them up.  I wrote "catch-up" entries and tried to re-cap after a flurry of activity had died down, but they really lacked the impact or insight that I was looking to preserve.

      Brunch and more   Brunch was a nice, casual affair today. Mostly it was the out of towners who came in for WedCon and we enjoyed more food, fun and games throughout the day. I settled on an easy brunch menu: a baked egg-vegetable-sausage dish (with vegetarian sausage), bread pudding with a raspberry-cranberry compote, homemade lemon poppyseed scones, thick-cut bacon, virgin mimosas, and lots of coffee.    I was very happy that so many people were willing (and able!) to come back over to the house today for more socializing. We finished up the day by having dinner at Ray's Boathouse with those last few stragglers willing to close out the weekend with us. Now, I'm just tired out. Long couple of days and lots of cooking and running around.

      Verdict: Success  Ah, WedCon I went off fabulously well, if I do say so myself.  I spent the day cooking, which was fine with me. Several of us made a run out to the near-by Larry's Market to pillage their wine section, and as we were driving in I told the story of how it seems that no matter how often or how rarely or at what time I'm shopping that store I inevitably run one or both of a particular couple who live nearby.  Sure enough, I'm not three steps in the door, when who should I spy about 50 feet to my right but that guy on his way out the door!  It really is bizarre.   Chris and Hal, with the help of some of our early-arriving guests, helped get table coverings and chafing dishes set up while I finished food prep at the house.  Jess and Kathryn picked up my order of tiramisu for me. By the time I arrived, things were looking good and I for one was starved.  I dug into the food while folks trickled in and began chatting and setting up games.  In all, by the time it was really underway, we saw between 30 and 40 people at the event, including one kid roughly Kate's age who wandered into the hall and stayed for most of it, prowling around the room, snooping around the games, sticking his finger in my foods.  I was most unimpressed, but a couple of guests seemed to take pity on the kid and invited him to stay, so I bit my tongue.  I was very pleased to see our friends from Vancouver, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland and Minneapolis could make it, as well as folks from Seattle who pop up once or twice a year at holiday parties and the like.  My friend Tim was celebratory as construction on his house has finished and we may be able to see more of him in the near future.  I personally played a couple of games of  urlLink Kill Doctor Lucky  but mostly tried to socialize.  Still, others got in several games (mostly card games of various sorts) and the event had everything we could have hoped for.  Then I came home, visited with a couple of friends who weren't ready to head home yet, then with the fellows who are staying over.  Finally got the kitchen cleaned after today's marathon cooking session, just in time to host a brunch tomorrow for those who didn't get to see enough of us today.   On that note, best get to bed so I can get things started nice and early for brunch!

      Vivid Dreams  In the few weeks since my grandmother's funeral I've been having vivid dreams.  Twice I've dreamed that I was at "the cabin" (though the house and the surroundings were not the cabin of my youth), where my grandma was restored and with us again.  The dreams, though steeped in unreality, were vividly realistic at the same time.  Grandma was the grandma I knew and loved, before her crushingly slow slide into Alzheimers.  In both Grandma dreams, they had an ending that involved us knowing that our time with the restored Lila was temporary and that she would be leaving us again.  In the most recent, she died and disappeared (maybe ascending to heaven?) and Grandpa matter-of-factly announced that it was time for him to take up smoking.  The Grandma dreams both left me feeling distraught upon waking, because the Grandma of my dreams was more vivid than any recollections of her that I can call up by conscious choice.  In my dreams, she was as real as real, down to the soft scent of Oil of Olay wafting around her.  I've had other vivid characters popping up in dreams, including one this morning that was full of people from my junior high school who I haven't seen in years (Danny Hunt!  T.J. Chandler, Rob Webber, Eric Buss).  I'm sure there'd be more to it, if some telephone solicitor hadn't called the house just then and woken me from it.

      Misery Loves Company  And what good company I'm in!  Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who responded to my last blog entry, both here and in private.  I heard from people I didn't even know were reading, people who have been there and done that, people who used to be here and used to do this and have moved on to other rewarding endeavors.    In giving it some thought over the last couple of days, it's clear my discontent is two-fold.  Obviously, as many of you have commented, the vocal members of the gaming fan base can be persnickety and critical.  It's not just limited to the fans, either; at the worst of times my fellow industry professionals have been known to be critical and petty and vicious concerning the work of others.  However, even without that element, even if I removed myself from or never was confronted with the petty criticisms that run rampant all around me, there's a more nagging feeling that I'm just not doing anything  important  or lasting or meaningful.  That there are more important things that need to be done in the world, and I'm shirking.  I felt this way for a while after my daughter was born and people started treating me like an adult and a mother.  I couldn't get over the feeling that I was going to be found out: I'm no mother, when did I become a grown-up?  That I was only faking it, didn't know what I was doing or wasn't doing it "right" and sooner or later I was going to be found out, exposed.  That feeling has faded as I've "faked it" as a mother for long enough and both my daughter and I seem to have come through ok.  "Fake it 'til you make it," as a friend says to me.  I guess where mothering is concerned, I've made it.  But this career of making games, even after 15 years and especially in the face of the greater needs facing my immediate community, my extended family, my citizens of my country, the rest of the people in the world...I again feel like a charlatan, a fraud.  Getting by doing what I'm doing only because no one is examining very closely what it is I'm up to; as if some authority figure is going to burst into the room at any moment, yelling, "Didn't I tell you to put those things away?  Now, get out there and mow the lawn, and save some endangered species while you're at it, you slacker!"  I suppose I just don't want to be accused of fiddling (in the  engaging in nonsensical, trifling matters  sense, not in the  to play the violin  sense) while the world burns.  Meanwhile, I spend the day preparing for WedCon.  The guest list is in flux, what with people having car crashes, hurricanes closing down airports, and generally flaky and forgetful friends being flaky and forgetful.  Still, I expect to see some 40-50 people on Saturday, and I intend to feed them all.  If gaming kinda gets me down, cooking and feeding people is my joy, and catering WedCon is my current excuse.

      I hate what I'm doing  Periodically, anyway.  And right now, I have to say that I do hate it.  HATE it.  I look around at the world, and I think that I might be doing something fun, something that I enjoy, something creative that brings pleasure and distraction to a troubled world... I enjoy self-employment, so I don't have to work in a soul-sucking corporation that's going to abuse both my talent and my good nature until I want to blow my brains out in their cubicle bay.  But no. It's not anything like that.  It hasn't been anything like that for more than a handful of days over the course of a decade.  Instead, imagine a job where every single thing you do (from how you file the business cards in your cubicle to what color you wrote your memo on) is up for judgement by any random guy who walks through your office.  Worse, not only is every aspect of the job you do up for criticism, but the random guy who gets to critique, more often than not gets to critique your performance (or, a lot of the time, what he *perceives* as your performance) by shouting through a bullhorn in front of all your colleagues and competitors.  I'm just so ground down these days.  No joy in Muddville.  I work for a three-and-a-half person company.  We put out 24-30 books a year by working with other professionals who contract with us to do art, writing, editing, fact-checking, design, you name it.  We pay as generously as we can afford, and try to be fair in what we expect.  We work hard, and largely put out superior product, if I do say so myself.  IN SPITE of getting absolutely, totally, screwed with no lube on what seems like a regular basis by people who contract with us.  We work our asses off so that the in the end, the customers get the book they were promised and we try to make our trials and tribulations as invisible in the end result as possible.  Artists who don't turn over their art, artists who want to be paid before they've even completed the work (and after they've agreed to other terms), artists who take the money but don't turn over anything even close to their best work for it, writers who turn in god-awful manuscripts, writers who miss their deadlines by a month, two months, FOUR months, people who ask for extensions on their deadlines and then after the extensions have passed tell us they haven't even started or turn over material that makes it clear that they did it the night before it was due (like some sort of high school term paper), people who screw us over for months and then bitch about us behind our backs about how we're, you know, kinda pissed off about it, people who say they're turning over a project that was clearly outlined and defined (let's call it The Game) and when we get it, what we get is The Adventure, or The Sourcebook That Couldn't Be Called A Game If You Lied.  Oh, it just goes on and on.  And then, once we get this stuff in hand, and we bust our asses to fix it, to make up for the people who are screwing us and making the best we can out of it, there are still the usual heart-aches of printers not printing, shippers not shipping, hackers hacking our websites and e-mail, people using fraudulent credit cards to rip us off...you know, the usual costs of doing business.  So then, month after month, we put these products out to hopefully bring some small amount of pleasure to people.  What kinds of comments do we receive?  "The text density is below average," or "The sidebars are too wide, and there is wasted space because they put a double-space between paragraphs." (Except, you know what?  It's NOT "wasted" and the "text density" is actually higher than your average book...because of clever graphic design and font choices, there are actually MORE words per page than our competition.  Not that anyone actually *counted* the words in the book, besides us.)  We weren't psychics, we didn't predict what a competitor was going to do and copy them, we didn't print on the inside covers of the book, we made the book/didn't make the book compatible with others, we made the focus of the book too narrow/too broad.  It goes on and on, and it happens every single time.  If it's not one guy, it's another.  For every one guy who thinks Book is great, there's another guy who hates it with a burning passion and takes the fact that it exists as a personal affront.  Now, I don't take every single comment personally.  You can't!  But I do get worn down, when NOTHING is ever good enough, when project after project is like slogging through mud with a boulder on my back, all the while with guys ridiculing me at the tops of their lungs: "You made a typo!"    Dude, I'm not making enough of a living at this, even considering the relative success we're enjoying, to go on with it if what I'm getting is this.  Spending a week in northern Minnesota, unplugged from my cell phone, unable to get online to check my hundreds of spam messages, looking around at the harsh-but-simple life that's available there...well, I guess it's made coming back here, and returning to the world of death by nitpicks, a little harder.  Maybe it's a midlife crisis.  Maybe, looking around at the world and the people struggling and suffering, I'm just beginning to think if I'm going to work this hard and put up with this level of shit for what I do I could at least be A) benefitting more from it, or B) doing something to actually improve the lives of the people and the world around me.  I'm just so tired of the pettiness, the squabbling, the scrambling, tired of working so hard and watching my partners work so hard, for such a meaningless, unappreciated, unnecessary end result.  I'm not working this hard to protect endangered species, to comfort sick children, to befriend the lonely elderly, to help kids learn to read, to stop pollution, to rescue the abused, to build sustainable transit, to provide clean water.  Why?  Why am I wasting my time and talents, whatever those may be, so that some self-appointed expert on imaginary monsters can tell me that what I've done is essentially wasted my time *and* made enough of an error in doing so that I deserve public ridicule.  Lovely.  Very, very tired of it.

      Busy Day  Since my personal and political musing seem to have offended people, you're all going to be treated to a rousing laundry list of what I did today instead of any thoughtful commentary.  Feh.  After getting almost nothing accomplished that I meant to on the weekend, I had a busy day today.  Got myself embroiled in PTA politics on Friday and gave my support to a movement to get an  urlLink alternative middle school  installed for kids in the South End of Seattle (the only alternative middle schools in Seattle are all in the North End; the kids in the South get nada) on Friday, so I did some research on that for myself this morning.  Managed to get Kate up and get her a lunch packed and get her off to catch the bus for the first time this school year (I've driven her every other day so far).  Did a bunch of research into the various candidates for City Council, Seattle Port Authority, and the two ballot measures that everyone is talking about (the " urlLink Pay a Dime More For Your Lattes and Fund Pre-Schools, You Yuppies " measure and the " urlLink Agree the Cops Have Better Things To Do Than Bust Potheads For Possession " measure) because tomorrow is election day. Was amused to note that some of the opponents of the latte tax measure include some of the  urlLink swankiest   urlLink restaurants   urlLink in   urlLink Seattle ; am I to believe that the customers of  urlLink El Gaucho   "Seattle's Premier Steakhouse!  who are asked to pay anywhere from $9 to $21 for an appetizer, and up to $47 for a steak, are going to be pushed over the edge by the extra 10¢ tacked onto their after-dinner espresso?  Or are those restaurants serving pan-seared foie gras and kobe beef just some of those "small businesses" being unfairly burdened by this proposed luxury tax? Interesting way to start the morning.  Later, I went to pay for the hall where WedCon will be held this weekend, found out that we had to give a floor-plan for how we want the tables set up and that we could pay with money order ONLY, ran off to the post office to mail several things and pick up money orders (one for the hall rental fee, one for the refundable deposit).    While we're at the post office, I get two message notices on my cell phone.  First is DHL telling me that they've tried to deliver a package to me twice and they need to figure out what to do with it; after spending 4 minutes 28 seconds on hold with them (gotta love those call timers) I was able to determine that they'd tried to deliver the packages at 7:40am and then again at 11:20am on 8/29, and then, finding no one here (we were in Atlanta for DragonCon, in fact) they held onto the packages until today, leaving no message or note or any sign whatsoever that they'd tried to deliver anything while we were gone.  Ug.  Agreed to just come pick the darn things up (two large boxes from our Canadian printer).  The second call was from friends expecting their first baby in just two weeks, calling to say they'd had a bit of a scare (doctor, looking at the wrong medical records had called to say he wanted to induce their baby TODAY!  Yikes!) and they realized they needed to gather the troops and finish the renovations on their house so that they have finished rooms to live in once the baby comes.  I offered to help with whatever I could, and promised to meet them as soon as I could get Kate fed and get down to their house.  Finished running errands (went back to the WedCon hall with the money orders, dropped Chris off, went down to DHL to pick up packages, came home and sent off last minute corrections to our GenCon SoCal events listings, deadline today, etc) and finally peeled out of the house after 7pm to get down to Kent and help with the painting party.  Saw several other mutual friends there and had fun painting and chattering and feeling helpful.  Hadn't seen the house before, but got the dollar tour and admired all their re-model handiwork, including renovations to the master bedroom, the impressive feats of dry-walling and laying of tile and rebuilding of closets.  They've been working hard on this house and you can really see it coming together.  Now it's midnight and I still have  urlLink GAMA Trade Show  paperwork to fill out.  Tomorrow I must pick up the food and drink for WedCon, and maybe I can squeeze in a haircut too, if I'm lucky.

       urlLink The Man in Black    "I can remember very well how it is to pick cotton 10 hours a day, or to plow, or how to cut wood. I remember it so well because I don't intend to ever try to do it again."       My mother and I were talking to each other this spring about how surprising it was that Johnny outlived his beloved wife,  urlLink June Carter Cash .  It was clear he never intended to, that he thought she'd be around long after he'd gone.    Bono of U2 fame  urlLink described  his sound thusly,"He is a character of truly biblical proportions, with a voice, all wailing freight trains and thundering prairies, like the landscape of his beloved America. He has a soul as big as a continent, full of righteous anger mixed with human compassion."  Exactly!  In my formative years, spent in northern Minnesota and surrounded by hard-working men who worked in the mines of the Iron Range, who made their homes in what would seem to many an unhospitable climate, I often heard the music of Johnny Cash.  I sang along with the simple, straight-forward lyrics.  Cry, Cry, Cry, Don't Take Your Guns to Town, Ring of Fire, Folsom Prison Blues, A Boy Named Sue, I Walk The  Line, One Piece at a Time...    I moved off into a world where I didn't bump into old Johnny much, a world of pop radio, a world of  urlLink Shaun Cassidy  and  urlLink Rick Springfield , a world of New Wave and Punk, of Prince (before he changed his name to  urlLink a symbol , and before he became a  urlLink Jehovah's Witness ) and  urlLink Hüsker Dü  and  urlLink The Replacements .  In the last couple of years, as I've gone forward to finally recreate the music collection I've lost through decades of ill-planned, cross-country moves, break-ups, and restarts, I decided it was time to fill in a few of those old classics that were still lodged in my brain from childhood.  Johnny Cash was the first I moved to restore.  Kate now knows all the songs on  urlLink The Essential Johnny Cash , sings along to Hey Porter, Get Rhythm, Don't Take Your Guns to Town, A Boy Named Sue... and I feel like I've done a good thing.

      Today is a Day  The anniversary of things I prefer not to relive.  My friend over at  urlLink Wrong Turn Journal  who did some actual living through that which I only watched happening from the other side of the continent writes very movingly in a recent entry.  An excerpt:   If one half of the country says to the other half: We are all products of a singular country and a singular culture, one achieved with sweat and invention and libraries of ideas and the blood of the committed and innocent. Can we agree to assume the best of the other side, in fact to assume us to be all part of one struggle? And may we further assume that we all have the same black mark on our soul that consigns us to act out of a combination of weakness and high principle, that commits us to the struggle but keeps tricking us into slackening when strength is needed most?   Which dovetails interestingly into another debate I've involved myself in over in the comments section of  urlLink foldedspace.org . A portion of my small contribution to that long discussion:   ...I can pretend I know what motivates them, what they're like inside, but I don't *really* know. Acting as if I do does everyone a disservice, including me, because it allows me to act without compassion.  The truth is that no one wants to suffer, and everything a person does is to deny or avoid their suffering. The worst thing we human beings can do is lose our compassion for those who are suffering, whatever form that suffering takes, because compassion is one of the few things that makes us different from the animals. Without compassion, we can't ease our suffering or the suffering of others.    Today is the anniversary of an unpleasant awakening, an omen of a darker future more full of strife than one I'd contemplated a decade ago.  The giddy optimism of the cha-cha-cha dotcom start-up, where everyone seemed buoyant with possibility and opportunities hung heavy on the trees, ripe for the picking, seems like a near-forgotten dream to me now.  The veneer has cracked, the rusted frame is peeking through: we could not sustain that wild decade of growth and unbridled consumption, and "the American way" is beginning to be shown for the falsehood it is.  An unsustainable consumer society, built on the backs of the rest of the world, and it's only a matter of time before they refuse to make our sneakers and cars and computers for pennies and we will be forced to live within our means and pull our own weights.  For me, this is the anniversary of the day we were hit with the bill we'd come to believe we'd never have to pay.

      Free Day  After a poor night’s sleep in the strange cabin (where my brother and I stayed up talking until 3am), we joined the rest of the family for some lasagna and garlic bread.  We took showers, changed clothes, and then my side of the clan took off in the motorboat, the first time it had been in use all year.  Kate wore the same life jacket that I’d worn to go boating when I was her age, and my dad let her drive the boat just like my grandpa had done for us.  She drove the boat in circles, in and out of coves and folks in other cabins came out onto their docks to watch the fun.  We saw one water-skier and one guy on a jet ski, and scared off a nearby houseboat when the motor boats intruded on their nature experience.   With no other family obligations, we decided it would be fun to go into town for a while.  Dad took us (myself, Kate and my brother) into town to see if some of our family friends were around to go visiting.  We stopped in unannounced, but no one was home, so we took a drive up the  urlLink Echo Trail  hoping to see some wildlife.  No wildlife to be seen, but Kate managed to get in a good two hour nap.  The Echo Trail dropped us back out on the main road, and we swung by the Kleists again to see if they’d returned.  Steve and Theresa were some of my dad’s oldest friends, and a couple I remember with nothing but fondness from my childhood.  They haven’t changed much at all, especially Steve who is still very active as an outdoorsman and quite fit and handsome, if a bit greyer.  Dad and Steve swapped hunting and dog training stories and Theresa and I chatted about life and kids.  Steve has known me since I was smaller than Kate, and remembers Chad toddling around in diapers. Unlike my family homes, which have all been bulldozed or remodeled for the sake of progress, Steve and Theresa still live out by the lake in the log-cabin-style home they lived in when I was a child.  It was much more like coming home again than being out at the loaner cabin and I was glad for the chance to stop in.

      Beer, Pool, and Darts  The family returned to the lake for a while after the service, hung around and had a few beers in the sunshine.  Northern Minnesota was in the midst of an unusual September heat wave, so temperatures were in the 80s and soon enough the stories started flowing. Eventually we were overtaken by hunger and we moved on into town to have dinner at the Ely Steak House.  After dinner, we split up, with grandpa, Dolly and the kids going back to the lake and the kids and uncles hanging out in the bar area of the restaurant, playing pool and darts.  It was funny to see my dad and his brother, still quietly competitive after all these years.  I played a game of pool with my cousins and failed to sink a single ball (I’m not a good pool player) then moved on to playing darts.  I did a bit better at darts. We kids spent a lot of time trying to remember when was the last time we’d all seen each other.  We decided it had been sometime in the mid-80s, very nearly 20 years since I’d seen Jack’s kids and much longer than that since all of us had been there with Connie as well.  We closed out the bar and drove home just as Josh and I were figuring out we were pretty well opposites on the political spectrum.  Since Connie had gone home earlier with baby Eliana, I was the oldest cousin out that night.  Josh is the youngest out of all of us, a twenty-something raised in Florida for most of his life.  He and Johnny both have southern accents that really strike me as weird when I hear them, since I’m just not used to hearing any of the usual Lindroos clan drawling like that!  Most of them speak like they’re straight out of Fargo, or displaced Canadians.

       urlLink Birch Lake   My grandfather sold the lake house to my uncle almost ten years ago, when he and grandma moved to Arizona full-time.  A few years ago they remodeled the house, leaving very little of the original construction untouched.  Last year the dock and small rowboat shelter were damaged by ice and buckled during the winter, and when we arrived at the house this year it had been completely removed. There’s precious little of the house of my childhood left at the lake at this point, just the garage (an addition from the late 70s or early 80s), out buildings, and the boathouse for the speedboat my grandfather bought back in 1965.  Because of the number of family members in town, there wasn’t much room at the lake house, even with the remodel.  My aunt and uncle, their three adult children, other cousin and her baby and my grandfather pretty well filled up the house, so my side of the family was offered space in a nearby cabin, less than a mile down the road. The folks who own the lake house across the creek from my family’s property have another much more rudimentary cabin they keep for their family that they offered us.  I certainly appreciated the generosity, but it felt strange and awkward to be staying somewhere other than with the family.    I suspect it won’t be long before what remains of the cabin of my memory is remodeled or dismantled.  My aunt and uncle are not interested in boating or fishing the way my grandparents were, so keeping a dock or boathouse is not important to them.  They don’t have the same fondness for saunas and swimming, so the beach and the bay have become much more weedy than I ever remember my grandparents letting it get, and the sauna my grandfather built is being used as a storage closet.  I’d say it hasn’t been turned on for a good five years, and isn’t likely to see use again.  The sauna was always one of my favorite places in the cabin and its loss is just a symbol of our larger losses.

      The Ride to  urlLink Ely   My step-mom left the house shortly after 7:00am, intending to pick up each of my three step-brothers on her way north.  My dad was driving a second vehicle and taking me, Kate, my brother, and my cousin Connie and her infant daughter with him.  Connie drove up from the south to meet up with us, and then had to pack up everything necessary for the baby (playpen, diaper bag, baby foods, multiple changes of clothes, a portable high chair, car seats, a stroller…I’d largely forgotten how much baby stuff goes along with traveling with a baby!) and we got on the road around 7:30 ourselves.  We rode happily along, with Kate and baby Eliana amusing each other for much of the trip.  At one point during the drive, all three Lindroos cousins were on their cell phones to their respective spouses, since we’d all forgotten to make good on our promises to call them when we arrived at Dad’s house.  I was amused and gratified to see that I’m not the only one in the family with that trait.  We managed to meet up with Carol and her boys, arriving within minutes of each other thanks again to cell phone technology at the Wilbert Café, one of the oldest restaurants in Minnesota.  The Lindroos clan all ordered  urlLink pasties , and while the fillings were authentic and delicious, they had the soggy crusts of pasties that had been prepared in advanced and microwaved to order. Definitely NOT like Grandma used to make.  With full bellies again, we made straight to the Presbyterian Church in Ely for the memorial service.   The Memorial  The memorial service for my grandmother was held in the same Presbyterian church where I was baptized as an infant, and where I attended preschool.  I took Kate downstairs into the room where cake and coffee were to be served after the service, which doubled as my preschool.  I have a photo of my preschool class with all of us sitting on a little two-step stair.  I wandered into the nursery room itself, and wondered at how tiny and fundamentally unchanged it was.  Two ladies who knew my family and yet were unfamiliar to me were in the basement area setting up the coffee and home-baked bars that had been donated by the church women of my grandmother’s generation.  Upstairs people were mingling and greeting each other.   When we returned upstairs, I joined my aunt in arranging photographs of my grandma on the altar.  My cousins (her children) had also arrived at the church, but we were generally mingling in our immediate family sub-units.  Kate amused herself by chatting with Bonnie Starkman, who was serving as the organist for the day.  Bonnie and her husband were friends of my parents when I lived in town, and had boys my age and my brother’s age.  Bonnie was very sweet to Kate, just as she’d been to me when I was Kate’s age and it was wonderful to see her again,    The family was all called to the back room to talk to the pastor, a youngish woman somewhat older than me and somewhat younger than my dad.  I am quite certain she never knew my grandmother, and I found her generic memorial speeches and prayers empty and not a comfort in any way.  Bonnie began to play the organ, people were seated, and then the family was paraded out to take our seats in the front.  Grandpa, his children and their spouses took their seats in the front row, and then we cousins all sat side-by-side two rows behind.  Prayers were said, songs were sung, and the whole thing seemed to be generally removed from my actual family and our experiences, but I hoped that the event was some comfort either to my grieving grandfather or his and grandma’s aging, frail friends and relations.  Toward the end of things, my Uncle Jack stood up to say a few words of eulogy on behalf of the family.  Finally, something that really seemed to touch on my grandmother’s life and our experiences with her!  Jack’s speech was enlightening, touching, full of love and grief and truth about my grandmother and while he says he was reluctant to be the family “spokesperson” at the memorial, he did a great job and I’m very grateful that he accepted the unpleasant duty when it was thrust before him.  It was Jack’s speech that brought tears spilling over for the cousins, and our hearts broke all the more as we sat behind and watched as our beloved grandpa quietly sobbed in the front pew for his wife of 62 years.  The rest of it, all the blessings and talk of being reunited in the next life and all the prayers and hymns, really brought me no comfort whatsoever, but Jack’s speech meant everything and was the only thing I needed.

      Defeat of Jesse James Days  Kate and I arrived in Minnesota just in time for the start of Northfield’s “ urlLink Defeat of Jesse James Days ” celebration.  The town square was taken over with food vendors of all sorts: shish kabob, roasted corn on the cob, grilled shrimp skewers, grilled pork chops on a stick, corn dogs, pronto pups, prime rib sandwiches, fried cheese curds, battered mushrooms, funnel cakes, sno cones, lemonade… Missing this year was my dad’s annual favorite of smoked turkey legs, replaced by a vendor selling barbecued pork sandwiches.  After the decadence of Atlanta, it was low-end fair food of the highest order.  After strong-arming Kate into eating the second half of her hotdog, we strolled down to the waterfront, where carnival rides had been set up.  The place was crawling with kids from town, ready to plunk down their money for a chance to win a stuffed bear or ride in a spinning strawberry until dizzy.  Disneyland this was not.  Shady looking guys with tattoos and frightening scars intoned a practiced patter meant to lure us into games of chance.  Filthy, sweaty, surly men ran machinery and herded kids onto rides through a series of grunts and hand signals.  Ropes and wires and industrial-strength power cords criss-crossed the grass, lines for one ride spilling over and across lines for another, families exiting from the wrong side and plowing into kids rushing forward to take their turns. We gripped grimy handles and squished into uncomfortable seats with total strangers, and spun wildly around and around and up, down and around again to Kate’s utter delight.  On every ride, she tossed her hands in the air, screaming and squealing with delight, waving back to grandma or grandpa waiting on the ground. It was pure small-town, Midwestern carnival and she had the time of her life.  We returned to my dad’s house, played with the dog for a while, washed the carnival grime from Kate's body and turned in for the night.   My dad had to drive back up to the airport in the late night to pick up my brother, whose flight had been delayed, and the two of them arrived back at the house at about 1:00am.  I woke up as the dog greeted them and when my brother accidentally burst into my room, thinking I was asleep in the other, and then fell back asleep until about 5:00am, when it became apparent that I wasn’t going to get any more sleep that night and I got up and went into the kitchen for some cereal and coffee.

      Sick  Damn it all, I'm sick.  Don't think I have a fever, though I can't tell by feel due to the heat in the house tonight. Despite taking cold medicine all day, I've been just miserable.  Nose constantly running, chapped from blowing, lips chapped from mouth-breathing for the last 24 hours, violent sneezing.  I made it through five convention trips in four months (three of those packed into five weeks) but the filthy hoards in Atlanta and the constant, abrupt transitioning from the icy climate control of the indoors to the hot and humid outdoors finally did me in.  I feel like the "before" shot in a  urlLink Nyquil commercial .  So, what did I do today?  Rest, relax, sleep in?  Drink lots of fluids and eat chicken soup?  Well, not really.  Caught up with orders that came in during DragonCon, stood in line at the post office, took some packages to Federal Express, did assorted chores in preparation of getting up at 5:00am for my trip to Minnesota.  I feel terrible, but I just  can't miss  this memorial service.  Everyone in my family is going to be there, even my brother and my cousins from far and yon. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't go because of the common cold...and yet my bout with pneumonia after GenCon 2001 taught me that these "con colds" can turn into something worse for me almost without warning.    Kate and I did curl up together in my bed to watch  urlLink Shrek  and sip microwaved  urlLink Campbell's Soup at Hand  (so as not to dirty any dishes before leaving home again).  She kept saying, "We're the sick girls, having a girls' night in."  Still have to finish packing, so I'd better get to it.

      California Recall  I think the California recall is a huge mess, and I fear the ramifications such politics could have on the rest of the country.

While I am not your typical libertarian (the  urlLink World's Smallest Political Quiz  pegs me as a "left liberal" but does note that I'm 90% in favor of "self-government" for ones' personal life) I am occasionally in sympathtic striking distance of those Libertarians who aren't in the anti-school, gun-nut, or religious-cultist categories.

      Leaving Atlanta  The boys left for DC several hours ago.  Kate and I leave on 7:00pm flight, so we've got all day to kill here.  I think I'll take a look at the MARTA schedule and see where we can go by train today.  Might even go to the trouble of taking the taxi to the zoo or something.  I'm sure Kate could kill some time at the  urlLink zoo .  Last night's dinner was at a place called  urlLink Noodle.   The food was great, and the portions were huge.  Kate and I shared a bowl of miso udon with tofu, which the waiter split into two "small" bowls (the small bowls were bigger than Kate's head). We were stuffed when we left and including the cab ride we still spent less than we've spent on any other meal this convention!  Glad that we were able to find a place that was open on Labor Day.  Lots of places around the hotel were closed for the day, especially since most of the convention attendees left yesterday.

      Last Day  Today is the final day of DragonCon.  Pretty much the same as all the other days.  Since I'm not so much into the party scene these days, I kept clear of most of the goings-on, but I did work my way through the crowd enough times to amuse myself watching the people mingling in their incredible variety of costumes.  A guy last night hads a light-up TRON costume that had people on the street cheering for him.  Some of the BDSM-themed costumes made me glad Kate was back in the hotel room with Chris, though.  More fantastic restaurant experiences: Dinner at  urlLink The Abbey  with Dan Brereton and his lovely girlfriend.  It was luscious!  I had the butter-poached lobster tail, which was divine.  The Abbey has an extensive wine collection, which Hal made good use of. Last night we had to find a kid-friendly place, since my ex-father-in-law dropped Kate off with me a day earlier than expected, but luckily Kate has cosmopolitan tastes and sushi was fine with her.  We made reservations at  urlLink MF (Magic Fingers) Sushi , which had super-cute waitresses, a massive list of fine sake, and sushi of sorts we've never tried before.  Kate had an unpleasant surprise when her favorite tobiko (tiny, salty, orange roe) arrived in a green, wasabi-soaked variety, but Hal and Chris swooped in and devoured what she left. The Negi Toro Oshi, the Magic Finger's Special Roll, the California Eel Roll (combining the California roll and the Barbecued Eel Roll - Hal didn't care for it, but that just left more for me), the Philadelphia Roll were all generous 8-piece rolls.  We also got some Negi Hama maki, the kohada nigiri, the mirugai sashimi and the albacore tuna tataki sashimi were all excellent.  We ended the meal with mochi (mango and green tea).  Yum!  No clue where we'll end up tonight, since it's Labor Day and who knows what restaurants will be open.  The guys leave in the morning for an early flight to DC (where they'll spend a couple of days before heading to the Alliance Open House in Fort Wayne) and Kate and I leave in the afternoon for our brief stop in Seattle, before heading out to my grandmother's memorial in Minnesota on Thursday.

      Kate is beside herself with anticipation.  Today was her class skating party, then the kids were allowed to change into their costumes for room parties and snacks.  We're finally getting around to carving our three small pumpkins, when I finish blogging.  I dug out the Halloween decorations earlier this afternoon and have about 5 pounds of candy to hand out.  The weather is predicted to be near freezing overnight.  Unseasonably cold, the weather reminds me of the early years of my own trick-or-treating career, of trying to fit my plastic store-bought costume over bulky sweaters or trying to figure out how to show I really did have a costume on when my mother insisted I wear my snowsuit the year we had snow.  I have little photographic documentation of those years, though there was a picture floating around of me (~ age 7 or 8) as Wendy or Raggedy Ann or Wonder Woman and my brother (~ age 3 or 4) as Casper the Friendly Ghost.  I have no idea where that's gotten to.  Kate is dressed as a black cat, with fluffy black ears and tail and a black body suit. I picked up a mask for myself, a mouse.  She's going to be the little cat, I'll be the big mouse, and we'll wander in the cold until we're too tired or frozen to go on.  I'm betting it will be the cold that drives us home again.  Sometime around Valentine's Day I'll throw out the stale remnants of her Halloween haul, to make room for chocolate kisses and candy hearts.

      Nothing to report  I'm afraid I'm coming down with something.  Mid-afternoon this afternoon I started feeling really awful.  I'd noticed swollen glands in my neck last night, and again when I work up this morning but I ignored it.  Then a creeping headache that started before coffee this morning and was pounding by lunchtime.  One bowl of soup later, and I was feeling full-on sick. I laid down for a little while in the afternoon, but Kate was home from school early (it was a half-day for Seattle schools today) and the neighbor boys came over to play for a while.  No rest, no rest.  Of course, my brain kept mulling things over, so I spent about three hours working on the laptop from bed, while I let the drugs do their thing.  More ahead of me tomorrow.  Now is not the time to get sick.  I leave for a couple of days in Ohio for some contentious business meetings (for my relatively thankless volunteer job) on Tuesday; I not only need my wits about me for the meeting, I need to have things in order at home before I go.  Bleh.

      Local Cinema  I was able to buy my home in Seattle because of a  urlLink neighborhood renovation project . New Holly took space that was either undeveloped ("Hmmm, there's this big field under these high voltage power lines, I'm sure we could do something else with it!") or was World War II-era public housing, and turned it into a modern "affordable" neighborhood.  Now, the word affordable is relevant, of course, but the homes and townhouses that were listed for the first stage of development were unmatched for price if one was looking for a home within Seattle city limits that wasn't (literally) a one-room bungalow from 1910, or a "charming fixer-upper" in the heart of the industrial district.  By choosing one of the last homes available, on the smallest lot in the development, we were just able to put every last cent into buying our home.  It certainly helped that the developer was eager to sell, in order to get the rest of the funds released for further stages of the development.  The prices for homes in the subsequent "stages" of the development are significantly higher than what we paid.  We were extremely fortunate that timing worked out for us as it did.  We now live in a modern house, with plenty of electrical outlets, fully wired with cable and telephone connections in every room.  The neighborhood has  urlLink a branch library  and  urlLink community center , multiple parks, and is bordered with bus stops for several different bus routes. It's all very handy, and while not as full-on urban as living downtown or in the University District, it's still pretty acceptable to me.  The one thing we don't have are the other amenities people associate with urban living.  There's one corner store, which I call the beer and bread store.  It's the kind of place whose windows are covered in posters for Old English 800 and 24-packs of Michelob Light, which I must admit, does not meet my shopping needs.  The nearest supermarket is a decrepit old Safeway, positioned next to the salvation army/gospel mission/youth outreach center a the bottom of the hill.  Their selection is focused on stocking plenty of  ramen noodles, white bread, Budweiser, potatoes and hamburger but it's not the sort of store where I'm able to buy more than the very generic basics (milk, cheddar cheese, frozen pancakes, soda). We have no neighborhood bar or tavern, no local butcher shop or bakery, no neighborhood restaurants (besides the very good, though exceptionally informal and tiny  urlLink Willie's Taste of Soul ), no shops, and certainly no Starbucks (or indy equivalent).  For those things, we have to go to  urlLink Columbia City .  Columbia City is not far, less than a mile from the house.  It's where my daughter's school is located, and where the  urlLink farmer's market  runs from May to October.  There is a library (currently under renovations), a couple branches of different banks, two thriving coffee shops (Starbucks and  urlLink Lottie Motts ), a tavern (the  urlLink Columbia City Ale House ), a butcher shop (Bob's Quality Meats, founded in 1909, is the oldest, continuously operating meat market in the state of Washington) that I keep meaning to try, and a couple of nice restaurants (from Willie's Taste of Soul's rival BBQ place,  urlLink Jones Barbecue , to the more upscale  urlLink Deux Tamales  and  urlLink La Medusa ).  Columbia City is the location of the post office I use most often, even though I technically cross the zip code line to get there I consider it "my" post office.  In addition to all these riches, there is now an organization that has started a movement to bring back a local cinema to the neighborhood.  The  urlLink Columbia City Cinema  is definitely a work in progress, but thanks to either my association with Orca school, or maybe something I signed up for at the farmer's market, word trickled down to me about the organization, its fund-raiser showings of movies all this month, and so on.  Last night I finally had the opportunity to go there and see the place (and a movie) for myself.  What fun!  Films from the last few weeks have included matinees for the kids (The Brave Little Toaster, The Black Stallion, My Neighbor Totoro, James and the Giant Peach) and evening classics for the adults (This is Spinal Tap, Double Indemnity, Dr. Strangelove, Rebecca).  Halloween night they've got Nosferatu on the schedule. Last night's feature was North by Northwest.  We walked in immediately behind another family who had never been to the cinema before.  The father, while paying, asked what millimeter the film was and was very twitchy when told we'd be seeing a DVD.  "A DVD?! A DVD, on a television?!"  His rising panic was palpable and started to touch off a feeling of panic in me against my will.  I could vividly picture us, a sad group of viewers, huddled around a television on folding chairs, and I'd already made up my mind that I really didn't want to sit by this freaky father.  He was reassured and offered a look at the screen around the corner, and I paid my fee and went in.  To the right, an informal little concession stand had been erected, staffed by a grinning middle-aged woman and her husband/assistant.  Fresh popcorn and sodas, suggested donation $1 each.  The popcorn was great!  Straight ahead is the theater itself, with a makeshift screen (little more than a two-story sheet on a wooden scaffold) and seating including cushioned wooden benches (church pews?) and yes, folding chairs! (According to their newsletter, they've had a donation of theater seats, but have to raise the money to have them transported to the theater at $3 a piece, so we may be sitting on folding chairs in the future.) In the center of it all was the DVD and projector.    Once the lights were dimmed and the movie started, I certainly lost myself in the experience and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I suspect Father Freakout did as well.  I was happy to pay what Chris called "New York prices" to contribute to the fundraiser, and I look forward to seeing this community cinema take shape.  I can't wait to see what the schedule for November is.

      Funny   urlLink From the Onion ... "That guy was so much cooler than Daddy's band. I asked them to play 'Yellow Submarine,' but they said no."    They interviewed Kate for this, I'm now sure of it!  (How they managed to get her comments on her father's May 2004 wedding so far in advance is beyond me, however.)

      Nostalgia  Fall often makes me nostalgic.  The school year begins, convention season ends, things return to a predictable, ever-darkening routine.  The end of the calendar year approaches, whistling past with gathering momentum as holidays spring up, loom, and recede one after the other.    Kate is still blissfully anticipating Halloween, daily changing her mind about her desired costume, her imagination completely taken up with stories of scary houses, houses that give "pillow cases of candy," houses that give money instead of candy!  Just a few more years and she'll be "too old" for trick-or-treating.  For my whole life, fall has meant the start of school, Daylight Savings Time, Halloween, my birthday (back when my birthday seemed to be something to celebrate, rather than the date my drivers license expires). A slight respite, and then on to the gluttony of Thanksgiving, the commercially manufactured and gift-wrapped prospect of Christmas crashing headlong into New Year's Eve, and the first few days of the New Year when checks and school papers are misdated and we realign our minds to the changing numerals.  Most people think of Christmas as a "winter" holiday, but I've always held December as part of autumn.  Winter is that bleak period, when we get up in the dark and end work in the dark, when the least sincere of holidays (Groundhog Day? Presidents Day?) are the only breaks in the cold, leafless dark.  Many tender, enraging, heartbreaking memories live in the autumns of my past; winter, not so much.

      Clean and rested  Ah, what a glorious, do-nothing day!  Which is not to say that I did nothing, exactly, but more that I had no demands on me in any way today.  I set my own agenda, I accomplished only as much or as little as I felt like accomplishing.  I meandered through the day, and I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.  My big project for the day was to help Kate clean and organize her room.  Her room was an unbelievable disaster, and to the point where no one could walk into it for all the junk piled on the floor.  Kate has a fascination with boxes, as many kids do, and over the course of a few months will end up absconding with boxes from which she makes forts, cars, doll beds, pirate ships, you name it.  Pretty soon there's a pile of boxes in her room that could house a small army of  urlLink Ewoks . Stuffed animals, dolls (and their plastic accoutrements), dishes (for tea parties and picnics) and endless piles of craft-stuff (broken crayons, pencils, glitter, beads, string, and paper...so much paper).  Kate and I spent a good long time getting her things sorted, binned, crated, stacked, and generally organized.  Through the well-practiced Mommy-method of distraction, I managed to clear out two bags of garbage (my definition of garbage and Kate's being quite different) and removed at least 10 cardboard boxes!  Holy cow.  Then I got to indulge in the obsessive part of me that likes to organize all her  urlLink Polly Pocket  shoes and re-dress all her naked  urlLink Barbies  and outfit her  urlLink American Girl  so the poor thing doesn't have to wear pajamas for another year straight. If you count sorting the doll clothes and organizing the doll accessories, Kate and I played with the dolls for at least an hour! I also tracked down my long lost Windows 98 CD and was able to return "her" computer to "working" order (meaning she can once again play  urlLink SIM Safari  or  urlLink Pajama Sam , but still can't access the internet from her room, which she desperately longs to do). I'm one extension cord shy of being able to install wall lamp high enough on the wall that she can control it from her loft bed.  I did a couple of other house maintenance things (updated software on the computers, finally got the drivers downloaded so that our printer works with our upgraded OS–that only took about 6 months!) but the weather was wet and I did not feel like gardening in it, so instead I watched Trading Spaces and  urlLink The Restaurant  (and if there's one thing that has convinced me that I never want to go to a Rocco DiSpirito restaurant, it's seeing two episodes of that show!) and did some crossword puzzles and overall had a very peaceful, quiet Sunday.  Fabulous!

      Partied out  Last night I went to the birthday celebration for my friend  urlLink Stan!  and had a mighty nice time.  We had dinner with several mutual friends and then adjourned to a private karaoke room at Seattle's Best Karaoke, where we sang all manner of crazy songs into the night.  It was a kid-friendly affair and everyone was very kind to tolerate Kate's request to sing Britney Spears and N'Synch songs (the only words she actually knew being the choruses) when it was her turn.  The music was ear-splittingly loud, but I learned that this does really help people lose their inhibitions and and feel more free to sing along, since you can barely hear yourself singing except during very subdued songs. And some of the attendees were actually very good singers.  I, however, did not sing (except from the privacy of the corner seat I staked out early on) and that was just fine by me.  As in most things, I'm actually perfectly happy to watch other people having fun without having to try it myself.  Tonight was Tim's housewarming, and again it was a Kate-friendly party.  Lots of friendly game and computer geeks, including an guest appearance by Unseelie, all gathered to enjoy Tim's spiffy new house in Renton, including his surround-sound tv/Xbox/entertainment area.  Several games of mediocre pool were played, and when you're an mediocre pool player, there's nothing like finding other mediocre players to play with!  Much less humiliating than playing with my pool-shark younger cousins, that's for sure.  I've definitely done my socializing for the week, though.  More than anything, both parties ended up being loud (dinner at a loud restaurant, karaoke, and lots of people and loud video games) and I'm perfectly content to curl up in the quiet of my own house tomorrow, I think.  Or, if it's not raining, get a little more gardening accomplished.  Except for tilling the side yard, I don't have any loud gardening on the agenda.

      Cubs  The Cubs are out.  I did so want them to make it...  WGN was in the first cable tv package we ever had, and I spent many summers watching the Cubs, singing with crazy drunk old  urlLink Harry Caray  in the 7th inning stretch.  My high school sweetheart was a baseball nut and a Cubs fan, and my post-high school sweetie was from Chicago and cheered for the Cubs as well.  When the Atlanta Braves started their domination of the 90s, they did so with some former Cubs on their roster.  Oh, don't get me wrong, as a Minnesota girl, I got swept up in the  urlLink Twins run to the World Series , but those cute Cubs, those scrappy underdogs, won my girlish heart. ( urlLink Ryne Sandburg  helped.)  Which is why I so totally agree with Wil Wheaton's comments to  urlLink That Guy .    Now, all that's left is to watch and see if the Red Sox can finally make Chris's dad a happy man.

      Elections  The eminently reasonable and clever  urlLink Jeff Tidball  is currently on a mission: to find the candidate that earns his support for the upcoming presidential elections.  He's posting the results of his search, starting with the Democrats in alphabetical order, one per day to his blog.  Sadly, I'm forced to wonder if such diligent attention to the candidates will matter in the face of news stories about  urlLink GOP redistricting in Texas  and the  urlLink vulnerabilities of electronic voting  and Wired.com reports of allegations that  urlLink Diebold  installed patches on its machines before the state's 2002 gubernatorial election that  urlLink were never certified by independent testing authorities  or cleared with Georgia election officials.  It would be easy at this point to harp on the  urlLink unfortunate comments  of one Wally O'Dell, but everyone is entitled to their political views.  It just seems to me that we're also entitled to be suspicious when the owner of the company that's making some large portion of the fancy new voting machines also makes a public promise to deliver Ohios votes to Bush in the next election.  I mean, if the tables were turned and it was one of "Clinton cronies" in Walden O'Dell's place, I can't imagine that going over too well either.

      Letter from a Friend in Africa  I received a letter from a Canadian friend of mine today.  She is traveling in  urlLink Tanzania  and  urlLink Kenya  with several other Canadian researchers and educators. Today, she writes about the efforts of a local Tanzanian organization that is fighting for the rights of women and children there:    Then off to a WONDERFUL organisation called  urlLink Kivulini . I was SO impressed with their work. They work against domestic violence: phyical, psychological, sexual and economic. WOW. Some of their cases were horrific. They have a legal wing which takes on court cases but it is one hell of an uphill battle. They haven't won one rape case. One child was raped and injured so badly she can't walk properly. The case has been in the courts since 2001 and keeps getting postponed. Another child was raped and taken to the hospital. You have to PAY to file a police report and the aunt didn't have the money. When she came back a few days later the doctor who had examined the child had been paid off by the rapists and now refused to testify on the child's behalf. They have a bit more success with property rights (if a woman is abandoned or divorced she rarely gets ANY of the household property or money) but again, the one with the most money usually pays bribes and the courts/police etc always find in the husbands favour.  So many of the health issues we are examining have deep roots in the inequity with which woman are treated- woman attend medical facilities less because they have to have permission and money from the husband. Many of the microcredit enterprises you hear about for women actually end up putting money in the hands of the men. Women are frequently beaten very badly for asking for money, for challenging the man, just because....  I am going to very strongly suggest that we consult with Kivulini and develop a module around these issues because I think they are inextricably linked to the poor health status of women here.    There are no easy answers to the suffering in the world, but I deeply respect my friend for trying to do something for the lasting good.  Her efforts come at a high personal cost for her as well, as she must leave her husband and her four children at home in Canada while she does this work.  It would not be possible for her to do this without the support of the University, her husband, her parents and in-laws.  It's taking quite a large effort from her entire, extended support group to even  try  and there is no telling what the lasting result will be.  It's hard for me to conceive of undertaking something so difficult, so many reasons to become discouraged and think it's not "worth it" to even start.  And yet, the thought of living in conditions that would allow my precious baby girl to be raped and injured until she could no longer walk, and being powerless to do anything about it, is so horrific, so beyond comprehension, I can't pretend it doesn't exist just because it isn't happening to  me .  You go, Catherine.  Good for you!!

      Mystic River  Went to see  urlLink Mystic River  last night.  During the previews, Chris and I both howled with laughter at the "This Fall on the WB" Tarzan preview!  It looks dreadful. Modern Tarzan in the "urban jungle of New York," falls for pretty police detective Jane. Saw a preview for  urlLink Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World  which I've been especially curious about since JD  urlLink got himself thrown out  of an advanced screening.  Was intrigued to see Ben Kingsley in the preview for urlLink House of Sand and Fog , though I probably won't make it to theaters to see that one.  Big YAWN to the third Matrix movie.  I didn't even bother to see the second.  Maybe someday I'll watch them all on video and become as enamored of The Matrix trilogy as the rest of my geek friends, but for now I find it all beautifully dull.  On the maybe pile is also  urlLink The Last Samurai  which looks like it could be beautiful samurai eye candy, wholly in spite of Tom Cruise.  I've been reading Mystic River, the novel, and very much enjoying it.  I decided to see the movie even though I'm less than halfway through the book.  You just can't count on child-free nights to go to the movies on a regular basis, and I figured I'd better see the film I was interested in even if the timing wasn't exactly right.  I enjoyed the film of Mystic River.  I've read some reviews that complain that it's a movie "about" child abuse and teen murder but it doesn't "say" anything profound about them.  I don't think the murder mystery, or the grand tragedy of the murdered youth is so much the point of the story at all.  In fact, unusual for me, I figured out exactly where it was going and who had done what about halfway through the film.  More interesting to me by far were the portrayals of those boys turned adults, how the opening incident stained and misshaped their lives. Sean Penn in particular did a great job of playing his character who tumbled through love, grief, fury, redemption, regret, revenge and back again, neither wholly good nor wholly bad.  I let it wash over me, the background of poverty and struggle, desperation, shattered dreams, the kids who grow up wanting to "get out" and the embittered adults who failed to do so, the violence, the smoking and drinking and cussing working class.  I know it well and it was well done.  (Amusing aside: Chris laughed at one of the early throw-away references to a Boston bar, as it was the first bar that served him alcohol.)  I wrote a far longer review, but was starting to sound to arty and pretentious, so I'll just say that the supporting cast really makes the movie for me and in the end I enjoyed it.

      DAMN IT!  So, I cut the guys at  urlLink Empire Equipment  some slack.  Apparently these two brothers own the place, and they remind me so much of your typical working class Minnesota fellows that I have a hard time taking my wrath out on them.  They're so good-natured and apologetic and seem to be trying so hard...  Still!  Today they call me to tell me that my tiller should be there by 1pm, it was on a truck coming in from Portland.  YAY!  I had to be out of town until about 5:00, but I showed up shortly after that and nope, NO TILLER.  Grrrrr.  They immediately call the supplier they use to find out what's going on.  I tell them that  someone called me  to say it was going to be there, and that I was running out of good weather in which to do my tilling and planting!  Yes, the guy tells me, he was the one who called; his supplier told HIM it was on the way, and he doesn't know what the problem is, but he suspects that the suppliers are not carrying a lot of inventory and that things that used to be available within a day or two are now inexplicably taking weeks to arrive.  He tells me that  urlLink Honda  makes a nice little snowblower, but that they've announced that they're  sold out for the SEASON already !  What if there's a blizzard, I wonder, What kind of business plan is it to have no snowblowers left before the first snow even threatens to hit?  This leads me to a digression: While I was in Minnesota this fall, my step-mom told me that the family run general store and fixture of downtown Northfield,  urlLink Jacobsen's Family Store , had closed their doors this year.  It wasn't the local economy, or even the  urlLink competition from the chain-stores  like Kmart and Target that had sprung up on the edge of town that did them in: in the end, it was their suppliers who failed them.  Once upon a time, Jacobsen's was able to tell you that if they didn't have in stock a pair of galoshes in your size, or a green and black plaid shirt, or a giant corduroy floor pillow that you wanted they could get it for you within a couple of days.  In fact, that level of personal service was one of the draws of shopping at Jacobsen's over Kmart!  Sure, Kmart might have ten thousand identical, cheap, foreign-made plaid shirts that would do in a pinch, but if you wanted a particular brand or style of plaid shirt, it was Jacobsen's that could get it for you.  Until recently.  And once their suppliers started "just in time" ordering, and keeping stock levels at a bare minimum (thus being out of stock more and more often) Jake's lost that advantage and, in the end, their business.   The game business is seeing this same trend, and it worries me.  More and more, distributors are stocking less and less.  They don't want to be left with unsold stock, and who can blame them?  Unfortunately, in their effort to protect themselves from carrying unsold stock, they are more and more often out of stock (even if it's "just for a couple of weeks") on items.  This means that retailers, who also don't want to be left with unsold stock, get in the initial shipment of an item and sell through, but then either can't get any more when they want it or feel they've done well to rid themselves of the two copies they ordered and now they'll move onto the next thing rather than risk not selling restocked products.  More and more often, I hear stories of customers who want a product that I know for a fact is in stock and available, most times it's well-reviewed and in-demand product and yet the stores these customers go to don't have the product.  Worse still, many of them don't even try to do it the Jacobsen's way and get it especially for the person who wants it!  It's the "Kmart" treatment for you: here's what we have in stock, this is what you have to choose from.  Not what you wanted?  Well, we can't guarantee we can get that thing for you, so how about trying this other thing instead?  I can't believe that this manner of doing business will win in the long run, but it seems to be springing up more and more.  Anyway, back to Empire Equipment.  These fellows were honestly caring and concerned for me as a customer.  Their business card says "65 Years of Integrity" and I am convinced. I can't imagine that I would ever need any other significant equipment of the sort they sell (my yard is tiny and I don't need a riding lawn mower or leaf blowers or hedge trimmers) but they really did seem to want both my business  and my good will .  THAT is what makes the difference to me in this transaction.  Sure, Lowes, or Eagle Hardware, or Home Depot might want my dollars, but despite their television commercials that show friendly, eager staff going out of their way to help each customer, I've found that my good will actually matters almost not at all when I'm dealing with a large chain store.  They certainly have never made a move to do what the owners of Empire Equipment have done for me.  They've loaned me their own personal tiller, exactly the kind I ordered for myself, for my use over the weekend or as long as I need it until my own tiller arrives!  They loaded it up for me, gave me a gallon of two-cycle gasoline, and gave me a tutorial on how to work the thing.  I gave them nothing but my name and phone number.    Now, if I could only get the damn thing started, I could till the night away!  Much like a lawnmower or an outboard motor, the tiller has a pull-cord, and thus far I've not managed to pull that pull-cord in the right way.  I've followed the directions I was given, I've pulled away at it, and believe me, I feel like a laughingstock, the goofy housewife who can't get the motor running without a man's touch.  ARGH.  I will prevail!  I WILL till my yard and plant my plants.  At least I'm one step closer...besides, it's not like gardening is about instant gratification, is it?

      Hunter's Stew  Ok, I grew up in a hunting household.  My dad loves to hunt and fish and I grew up close to both.  He jokes that he remembers my birthday because of how it coincides with hunting season.  My dad has brought home many a fish, pheasant, grouse, and duck in his day.  Occasionally we'd even see a goose pass through, but geese, I've found, are just greasy, icky things.  My dad is the sort of man who would travel to the Arctic Circle to go fishing and then just bake the whole fish with salt and pepper when he got home with it.  (Seriously, he went to the Arctic Circle to go on a fishing trip one summer.)  Anyway, my dad never made anything like this Hunter's Stew recipe that ran in Cooking Light this month.  But when I saw the recipe, I knew I HAD TO make it.  It's no small undertaking, and I've managed to dirty the whole kitchen in the process, but my feeling it that it's totally worth it.  So worth it that I'm including the recipe here:    Hunter's Stew  Cooking Light, October 2003   1 pound dried cranberry, Great Northern, or navy beans 11 cups water, divided 2.5 cups chopped, peeled rutabaga or turnip 3 cups cubed red or Yukon gold potato 3 cups quartered crimini or button mushrooms 2 cups chopped onion 1 cup chopped carrot 1 cup chopped celery 1 (5.75 - 6.25 lb.) dressed domestic duck, fresh or thawed 2 chicken drumsticks 2 chicken thighs 9 ounces sweet turkey Italian sausage 3 cups Cabernet or other dry red wine, divided 1/2 cup fresh chopped flat-leaf parsley, divided 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1.5 teaspoons dried summer savory 1.5 teaspoons dried thyme 1.5 teaspoons salt 1.5 teaspoons black pepper 1 14.5 ounce can fat-free, reduced sodium beef broth 2 cups croutons Fresh parsley sprigs (optional)  1. Sort and wash beans, and place in a large Dutch oven.  Cover with water to 2 inches above beans and bring to a boil.  Cook 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Cover and let stand 1 hour.  Drain the beans and place the beans in a pan.  Add 8 cups water; bring to a boil.  Cover and cook 1 hour or until just slightly firm.  Drain and set aside.  2. Place 3 cups water in a large stock pot; bring to a boil.  Add rutabaga and cook 5 minutes.  Add the potato, mushrooms, onion, carrot, and celery and return to a boil.  Reduce heat; simmer 15 minutes or until crisp-tender.  Set aside (do not drain).  3. Remove and discard giblets and neck from duck.  Rinse duck with cold water; pat dry. Trim excess fat.  Cut duck into 8 pieces.  Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add duck pieces; sauté 5 minutes on each side or until well browned.  Remove from pan.  Add chicken pieces, sauté for 5 minutes on each side or until well browned.  Remove from pan.  Add sausage; sauté 10 minutes, browning on all sides.  Remove from pan and cool.  Slice sausage into 1"-pieces.  4. Carefully add 1/4 cup wine, scraping pan to loosen browned bits, and add the pan drippings to stockpot with vegetables.  Add the beans, duck, chicken, sausage, 2.75 cups wine, chopped parsley, vinegar, savory, thyme, salt, pepper, and broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes.  Cover stew and chill 8 to 24 hours.  5. Skim solid fat from surface; discard.  Reheat over medium heat, stirring often to prevent scorching.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.  Sprinkle stew with croutons, garnish with parsley sprigs, if desired.  Serves 12 (serving size: about 2 cups stew, 1 poultry piece, 2-3 sausage pieces, about 2 tablespoons croutons)   Calories: 548 (27% from fat); FAT 16.1g (5.6g saturated, 4g mono-unsaturated, 3g poly-unsaturated) PROTEIN 55g, CARB 41g, FIBER 12g, CHOLESTEROL 195mg, IRON 8mg, SODIUM 659g, CALCIUM 128mg     Bottom line: YUM!

      Edgy  Spent the day extremely irritable and edgy.  Started out when I was awakened at 6:45am by a phone call: someone on the east coast calling without taking into account my time difference.  I didn't manage to get to the phone before they hung up, but it did serve to wake me sufficiently that I was up for the rest of the day.  The caller called back again an hour later, at which point I reminded them that it was still only 7:45am and it was ceartainly far too early to be calling me! Grumble!!  Then a round of annoying, irritating, and extremely enraging e-mails cemented my mood before the "business day" had even begun.  To top it off, I STILL do not have my tiller, so work on the front yard has stopped cold and it's in a half-dug state that drives me to distraction.  I'm quite irritated about this development too.  I've talked to the people at the equipment place three times since placing my order, and each time I've been told that either my order has not arrived and they don't know why, or they don't know anything about my order and "someone will call back" which they don't!  ARGH.  If I don't have my tiller by tomorrow, I'm going out to rent one somewhere and Empire Equipment can get screwed.  We're in for rain all week, and I've wasted a week of prime pre-rainy-season planting time waiting for these jokers to get their act together.  Not sure why everyone is insisting on making things more difficult than necessary lately, but I would appreciate it if everyone bent on inconveniencing me would just knock it off already.

      Footie Jammies  It's been a long weekend for me, and now that I'm home, I'm curled up in bed in my adult-sized footie pajamas.  Oh, how tired and sore I am...which leads me to wonder just how tired and sore Jess is, considering he ran the Portland Marathon this weekend!  We're so proud of him: I'm constantly in awe of his resolve in accomplishing this feat twice now!  But I get ahead of myself.  Recap: Friday I finished screwing around with pickles and jam and finally went to bed.  After getting up as usual Saturday morning, fiddling around with e-mail and errands (like going to the bank, gas station, coffee shop, etc) we finally managed to get on the road to Portland slightly before noon.  We arrived at my mom's house in the mid-afternoon, met up with my brother and his wife, then the pack of us (plus the little dog) showed up at Grandma's house for our "Before you go back to Arizona" annual visit.  Grandma's little ratty Chihuahua and mom's zippy Miniature Doberman know each other but not well enough to get along.  After much growling and chasing and stalking, and one minor injury as Zipper ran into my brother's giant new-age athletic shoe (attached to my brother's giant foot), the ratty hostile little dog was banished to the back room.  Grandma sliced super-thin slices of frozen cake (red-white-and-blue Sarah Lee, left over from, yes, July 4th) for us all, and served it with coffee, and we made uncomfortable chit-chat.  Eventually the whole group was able to have a fully fledged conversation revolving around the differences between  urlLink While You Were Out  and  urlLink Trading Spaces , focusing mostly on the worst episodes of both.  Finally we were getting hungry for real food, and since my mom's husband was away on a hunting trip this weekend, we were all footloose and fancy free.  I asked if anyone knew of any good restaurants in 'the city' and that nearly started a riot.  My brother tried to reach a gay friend of his in Portland (who is renown for his good taste and restaurant recommendations) without luck.  Before Grandma got going on recommending the local Chinese place (which I'm convinced must be god-awful if she eats there, as she and Al both feel coffee and a muffin at McDonalds are quite the tasty value for your dollar) or prime rib at the local seedy bar, I tried to head things off by specifying "I'm looking for something, um, up-scale." Oh, the flurry of shocked hand waving and protests from the elderly!  Grandma insisted she wasn't interested in paying $20 for a tiny portion of food served on a big plate.  I told her there was more to "upscale" than nuveau cuisine. "Well, you could try Shari's.  They bus people over from the Senior Center to eat there.  But stay away from Denny's in Wilsonville!"  EXACTLY why I specified "upscale": so I would not end up at Denny's.  Tried to get my mom to choose something to her liking, but she refused.  Chad and I poured over my Vindigo entries for Portland, and eventually settled on a funky Caribbean place called  urlLink Salvador Molly's  that seemed to be to everyone's liking.  Funny: I did end up paying $15 for the  urlLink Hawaiian Ono  special, which came in a plenty-big portion but on a big plate.  I'm sure grandma would have been appalled.  Kate and Grandma went back home with my brother and his wife, while Chris and I tried to hook up with Jess and his posse.  Turns out Salvador Molly's has two locations, and he went to the one we weren't at.  Then they turned tail and fled to the Limelight, which Vindigo did not have listed in the "bars" section, but did list under "restaurants and bars".  After a comedy of errors and following directions not meant for drivers (take a left over the walking bridge, turn the wrong way up 12th Ave, and so on) we finally pulled up in front of the Limelight to find it completely empty.  Completely by chance, I poked my head into an unlabeled doorway next to the restaurant and found the bar, complete with our friends.  We managed to hang with Jess for about half an hour before he had to go home and rest for the run.  We then went off to find a hotel of our own, in order not to be stuck staying in the uncomfortable accommodations offered at my mother's house.  Sunday: By the time we awoke, Jess had already been running for 20-30 minutes.  We swooped down to pick up Kate, run an errand or two for my mom and then hot-footed to Portland to be there to see Jess cross the line.  Yay Jess!  We met up with Kathryn, awaited Jess's appearance out the other end of the runners' area, and walked with them back to their car.  We then walked up to prowl Powell's Books for the first time in person (though we've ordered from the online store a few times) and Chris and Kate both found mutiple books they wanted to read.  I didn't even begin to browse, and Chris lamented that he could "spend a million dollars there" just in the sections he managed to peruse in the short time we stopped in.  I didn't even try to go to Powell's Books for Cooks after that.  What a good girl I am!  Tried unsuccessfully to get ahold of friend Dagny, but her friend Mac had also run the marathon and he was also quite exhausted, so getting together at all afterward just wasn't in the cards.  We headed off to have a late lunch/early dinner at  urlLink Kornblatt's Deli , where the matza balls are huge and the sandwhiches divine.  After lunch I decided to take the kids off on a trek to Astoria since I hadn't been there in years and I didn't have anything else to do that afternoon.  We got to Astoria shortly before sunset and got ourselves a hotel.  We'd already decided to play hooky and take Kate on a trip up to see  urlLink Mount St. Helens .  Chris had also been curious about the volcano since moving out here in 1997, so I figured it was time to stop driving past it and plan a visit.  We settled into our hotel room in Astoria, overlooking the water, and could hear the sound of sea lions barking from the nearby marina.  Kate and I walked down to the docks to see the sea lions close up, and we certainly did see a lot of them (we counted 47 before we gave up).  Apparently a  urlLink pack of sea lions  make their home in the little marina there, basking on the docks, even blubbering up into some of the vacant boats!  They barked and barked...past sunset and all freaking night!  Yes, ALL NIGHT.  I woke up a half dozen times, easily, and heard their annoying "ark ark ark" coming into the room.  Ug.    Monday: Before leaving Astoria, we drove a little way to see "the must-see sight of Astoria" the  urlLink Astor Column  commemorating Lewis and Clark's trip to Oregon and the various significant events surrounding the founding of the town.  The view from the top of the tower, (after we'd caught our breath from climbing) was fantastic, and Kate had bought a little balsa wood glider to toss from the top (an activity promoted by the tourist shop at the bottom). It was a neat little bit of history and worth noting that we could still hear the distant barking of the sea lions, though we couldn't see them anymore.  Then we bid the sea lions a less-than-fond farewell and crossed the Astoria Bridge to the Washington side of the river and drove a scenic woodland road back to the relative civilization of Longview, Washington.  I took Chris and Kate to lunch at  urlLink Burgerville, USA .  Burgerville is a local Pacific Northwest chain of burger joints.  There's one in my mom's town, several between there and Olympia, but none this far north in Washington.  As far as Kate is concerned, a cheese burger is a cheese burger, but you don't get a Tillamook cheddar bacon burger, or a wild huckleberry milkshake at just any chain burger place!  Fortified, we drove on up to see Mount St. Helens.  I lived in Oregon City in 1980, having just moved to Oregon from Minnesota nine or so months before the volcano exploded.  I have lots of very dramatic memories of the television footage of the ash plume, the flooding, the scenes of day turning to night, of ashfall around our house and of mountains of ash accumulated in Moses Lake, Washington where my grandparents lived.  This was my first visit to the  urlLink new visitor centers  along the road to the crater, the first time seeing the dramatic changes to the landscape first-hand.  Chris sat through a movie or two about the lateral blast, and and felt better educated.  I'd thought at the last minute to buy a disposable camera in Astoria, so I snapped a few pictures but then rain clouds descended on the mountain and we headed home in the rain and growing darkness.  I bought Kate a little box full of ash that she can bring to school to show her classmates, so hopefully her teachers won't be too annoyed that I called her in "sick" yesterday.  I mean, we were doing something educational!

      Preserved  Since I was stymied in my effort to finish the yard project (and frankly, too weak-willed to go back to working at it with just a shovel) I gave myself another project for fall: preserving.  As of last night, I've finished five pints of dill pickles, a half-quart of dill-pickled green beans (love these!), two pints of wild blueberry-maple-walnut jam, and four half-pint jars of organic strawberry-port wine preserves (which again this year look like they're not going to set, and will be used as sauce over vanilla ice cream: YUM!).  I've got a flat of blackberries ready to go, but at the last minute decided I would rather make a blackberry-apple pie, or a blackberry crumble than make any blackberry preserves with them.    I've also got ingredients for the Hunter's Stew recipe from the latest issue of Cooking Light (carrots, potatoes, celery, rutabagas, mushrooms, chicken, duck, and Italian turkey sausage, plus dried cranberry beans and spices). You have to make it a whole day ahead of when you want it, but it sounds so good (and would go so well with blackberry-apple pie!) that I'm excited to plan it for Tuesday's dinner this far in advance.

      My garden  While we were on the Great Convention Tour of 2003, the front "lawn" of the house was over-run this summer with clover, dandelions, and moss.  I took one look at it and knew something had to be done.  That something is, as of tomorrow, going to involve my new mini-rototiller!  I started trying to dig up the healthy patches of grass and move them clump by clump into one area, hoping I could transplant them.  I ripped up large sections of clover and weeds, and when I was done with all that, what remained looked pretty pathetic indeed.  I decided to go all-out and just dig up the grass and replant the whole area with flowers, shrubs, and ground cover plants.  The front yard is quite small, but half-way through I realized I'd under-estimated the amount of difficult work it was going to be to turn all that dirt by hand.  Tomorrow I'm getting a little mini-tiller, the Mantis brand.  I've already planted my lilac in one corner of the former "lawn", and I'm looking forward to getting the other plants in the ground tomorrow afternoon.  I've got three flowering heather plants, a pale blue-green evergreen-type ground shrub, a pot of lavender, a fantastic rosemary bush, and a rhododendron to place out there.  I've also got about 150 flower bulbs of various sorts that I intend to plant in lush clumps in the areas between.  After I finish with the front, I'm going to till the side-yard that runs the length of the house.  It doesn't get any use whatsoever because we've had to keep the gate locked to keep brazen neighborhood kids from using my yard as a thoroughfare!  They were utterly shameless!  If it works out, I will be planting the side yard with flowers as well.  It's just a narrow strip (less than five-feet wide) that was all bark chips when we moved in, but it's a southern exposure that faces the small kiddie park, so it gets sun all day long.  This summer, weedy plants grew waist high.  I have about 10 stepping stones/paving stones that I'm going to put out there, and just go to town planting flowers along both edges once I've torn up the earth with the tiller.  I've made a list of other plants I might like to acquire for the side yard and the back yard, if I still have time and energy to plant more than I have on hand right now (and if the weather holds out).  I'm interested in using some plants that are native to the area or using herbs and flowers that I'm especially fond of or have use for. Low growing huckleberry, vine maple, dwarf blueberry, maidenhair fern, bearberry, a clarkia amoena, some western trumpet honeysuckle, some phlox diffusa or some goldenrod.  Maybe now is the time for me to get that small Japanese maple I've been coveting.  I picked up the card for an organic nursery at the farmers market today, hoo hoo!  In the week or so that I've been slowly improving the front yard, the weather has been spectacular and I've met a dozen people from the neighborhood that I'd never spoken to before.  The neighbors on the corner across from me actually walked over to ask what I had planned and to tell me it was looking good.  Couples out for walks made eye contact and said hello, asked how I was doing as they passed.  School children walked past and acknowledged me with polite hellos and little waves.  It was like a scene out of the freaky neighborhood propaganda the realtors used to sell us the house: "Seattle's first new neighborhood in a decade! Every home has a yard and a front porch!  Neighbors speak easily over back fences.  Aren't you glad you're HOME?"  Frightening.  Little did I know what kind of curiosity digging up my front yard would inspire!

      Holiday Shopping Melee  According to  urlLink this widely-reported Associated Press story , a woman waiting in line to snag herself one of the $29 DVD players at Walmart was pushed down, knocked unconscious, and trampled by the crowd.  As horrible as that sounds, I was most horrified by the Walmart's response: they offered to put a DVD player   on hold for her  !  On HOLD?   "We are very disappointed this happened," Burk said. "We want her to come back as a shopper."    So, the woman is knocked unconscious and trampled in your store, in response to a holiday sale you are having, and the best you can do is invite her to come shop again?  The sale price for this DVD player was  $29 . The woman was  knocked unconscious .  Give her the bloody DVD player, GIVE IT to her! If you want her to come back to the store, give her a gift certificate to spend there later.  Perhaps corporate headquarters didn't grok that this woman was  trampled  in their store, but if I were the manager, if it happened in my store, if need be I would have sprung for the $29 out of my own pocket to make sure the woman had a DVD player when she gets out of the hospital.  Corporate values.  Happy freakin' holidays.

      Thanksgiving, eh?  Started my morning with a phone call from Canada, a guy calling about Academy issues.  I, predictably, was in the process of getting the kitchen ready for massive Thanksgiving cooking and must say that I did not want to deal with that.  The only thing less Thanksgiving-y than being reminded of my thankless industry volunteer positions would have been for some bill collectors or telephone solicitors to call.    Cooked myself to death this afternoon, and I have a ton of food left over.  Kate helped a lot with the prep work.  She's quite the enthusiastic helper. I got a twelve-pound smoked turkey from  urlLink Bob's Quality Meats , and it was delicious.  I supplemented with stuffing (I improvised my own recipe, using wild rice, bread cubes, Portobello mushrooms, roasted chestnuts, onions, celery, sherry, thyme and fresh sage), garlic mashed potatoes and gravy, maple-glazed yams baked with streusel topping (really good, not that overcooked marshmallow mess most people associate with Thanksgiving), green bean casserole, corn, two types of cranberry sauce, and black olives. I bought, but didn't serve, biscuits, jello, and green salad. I would have had pumpkin pie to go with this meal, but I offered it to Kate's class potluck yesterday instead.  Yes, there were only three of us.  I have plenty of food left over, no surprise there.  Thanks to Chris, most of the leftovers went immediately into divided containers to make complete mini-meals.  Half are in the fridge, half in the freezer.  Even so, I still had two huge freezer bags full of meat from the Turkey carcass, plus the carcass itself, which will be used for stock sometime in the future.  Some of the meat will be used in my traditional creamy turkey-wild rice soup.  You can tell I'm from Minnesota by the inclusion of  urlLink wild rice  in my holiday menus.  After dinner, Kate and I watched  urlLink The Planet's Funniest Animals  (the "Look! Animals Poop and Pee" episode, I think).  It's a dreadful show, mostly for the host and the voice-overs, but Kate just loves, loves, loves animals and it seemed like a good family bonding moment so I went with it.  Eventually I retired upstairs to watch my newly-restored TiVo (replacing the cable box did the trick, and now I have a box with a serial adapter, which makes me happy).  I tried to watch  urlLink Notorious , but it turned out to have recorded an infomercial instead.  Boo!  I watched Bogart in  urlLink Dark Passage , a movie he made with sultry, wonderful Lauren Bacall.  The story had maddening plot holes, and devices such as the cops whose job it is to harass anyone who might seem "suspicious" in any random location. WTF? TiVo had it as a three-star movie, and I agree.  IMDB's review calls it "underrated" but I think not.  Then I went for Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in  urlLink Bringing Up Baby .  Fun, fun!  Cary Grant answers the door in Hepburn's bathrobe and is laugh out loud funny.  Hepburn's gangster moll scene in the police station was a riot!  It's not entirely made up of high points, but the high points were certainly enjoyable. Kate came in and joined me for the end of that movie and we howled and hooted over the scenes with the leopards.  At the end, Kate's summary of the movie was, "Wow, she messed up his whole life!"

      Nothing exciting to report.  Spent the day filing, filing, cross-referencing, filing.  More filing to do, more organization of contracts and papers that have been sitting around unfiled for months.  Made a serious dent in the work.  Started putting our 2004 schedule into Microsoft Project, which means I have to work on the PC (which I've become unaccustomed to).  Completed a major update to the online store that should bring it into working order soon. Organized a precarious pile of project CDs that had no home.  My G3 refused to reboot this morning, giving me a few hours of despair while I poked, prodded, and repaired it.  Thankfully, it seems to be back to its old self, and yes, I had recently backed up.  The TiVo has not come back since the power outage on the weekend.  Or rather, the TiVo seems to be working, but the cable box did not reset itself, so our television is stuck on the dreadful PAX network as long as the TiVo is turned on.  I've reset everything, checked all the connections, to no avail. No time to screw with it over the next few days, either.  Bummer.  What I thought was recorded Iron Chef was really Christian easy-listening music videos, and what I thought was Changing Rooms ended up being Ginsu knife infomercials and the New Candid Camera.  I wouldn't watch that crap under torture.  Since I've been working long hours lately, I've done less reading, blog-browsing, or educating myself, and thus have nothing interesting to talk about.

      Fun, No Power, More Fun  Chris and I joined Ray and Christine last night for a relaxed evening of pizza and sitting in front of their fireplace.  Ray suggested that we play an old Avalon Hill game called Election, but we never quite got to the point of busting it out.  Eventually, Christine turned in, and I fell to dozing in and out of consciousness on the couch while Ray and Chris disected the game industry.  When they'd finally exhausted themselves, I roused myself and headed home.  Sometime early this morning, the power went off for four or five hours, so when I woke up the house was dark and  cold .  It's been very wintery in our area lately, with a small amount of snow sticking on the ground Friday morning, and temps getting down into the low 20s last night. Since we have a gas stove I was able to make tea (whole beans, no grinder = no coffee) and scramble up some eggs, and by the time I was done with breakfast the house had come back to life.  It was a real relief to hear the whole house powering back up, all the computers coming alive, the heat coming on, the refrigerators humming along.  Reminds me that I need to organize my emergency kit, so that all the things I might need are in one place in the house.  I have just about everything I could need in an emergency, but it's strewn throughout the house and that makes getting to whatever it is that I need more of a chore than it should be.  This afternoon we went to see the last matinee performance of Mike Daisey's 21 Dog Years, which was very enjoyable.  I laughed at many of the situations he portrayed, and the only real weak spot was the final "scene" with which he closed the performance.  The rest of the time, he had an engaged audience.  A few people even gave him a standing ovation at the close.  Chris left with the impression that Mike's wife must be one hell of an understanding woman.  After 21 Dog Years, we strolled around Seattle Center and stopped at the center house where we got coffee and a snack.  Ran into a friend and ex-co-worker of Chris's at Seattle Center House with his charming daughter, who I remember as a sweet toddler, now four years old and on her way to spend the afternoon at Seattle Children's Museum with her dad.  Tim was having a screening of the extended edition of the Two Towers at his house, complete with surround sound so we shot off to Renton for the rest of the night to enjoy that.  Mutual friend Bruce is set to relocate up to this area from the Bay Area in just a couple of weeks, and will be renting a room from Tim, so I hope to see more of both of them in as the new year rolls around.  Tommorow I'm beginning a major filing project, which is going to involve several file boxes, two small filing cabinets and a whole lot of paper.  Wish me luck!

      Lurkers  Recently I've found out that I have many more blog-reading lurkers here than I ever imagined!  It's a bit unnerving, though I understand the impulse to lurk rather than respond and reply on a blog.  Strangely, I find that in the blogs I read regularly I almost never participate or reveal myself and yet I want the opposite from those who read my own blog.  I like to read, anonymously.  I wonder what certain people would think if they knew I read their blogs.  And yet, I don't feel like "outting myself" as a reader on the blogs of others, unless we're close friends or their blog contents particularly stir me. And still, even with this understanding, I wonder why it is that Mystery Reader #1 knows of my blog and visits, but never comments. When I hear, sometimes through friends of friends, that a person knows of my blog, or enjoyed something I posted here, I wonder,"Why didn't they tell ME that personally? Why didn't they leave me a comment?  Why is my guestbook so bare, my guest map containing only a handful of participants?"    I like to hear that people enjoy my entries. Soccer Memories seems to have struck people in particular.  I received some public comments, some private comments; I walked in to join friends for lunch yesterday and they greeted me with "Liked your soccer story," so I guess people are reading and enjoying.  Still, it's a bit strange to think that people have sought out my blog, read it with any regularity, even go so far as to link to me on their own blogs without ever telling me so directly.  Secret friends, I'm glad to hear that you know and read Discolor Online.  In particular, I'm glad to hear that some of you are out there reading even when you don't care to comment, and especially I'm glad that one or two of you are planning to bring plenty of baby pictures to SoCal to share with us.  That said, I'd be very curious to know who is out there, who is reading, who likes what I've written so far, what you might like to see more or less of.  Anyone feel like coming out of lurking in order to leave a public or private comment, or maybe sign the guestbook or pin yourself on the guestmap?  Anyone new, any old friends out there in the woodwork who want to give a little wave hello?

      Soccer memories  My soccer coach in junior high frequently made me angry and often made me feel like dirt.  We started the season with two girls on the team, the rest of the team was made up of boys.  Half these boys were on the coach's league team, the other half were just enthusiastic kids from the school.  Only a few games into the season, the other girl unceremoniously quit the team and I was left as the only girl.  This soccer coach was popular enough with the boys, but he did not like having me on his team.  This was my first experience playing organized soccer, though I'd been a huge fan of the Portland Timbers, and I wasn't very good.  When we played games, he would put me into the game the minimum amount of time he could get away with.  I was not a good player, obviously, but I was also not ever coached in any way to become better, either.  I was very often told to run extra laps for being the worst dribbler, or pulled out of a game as soon as I'd completed one pass.  I dared not ever take a shot on goal if I didn't want to be pulled out immediately.  When we were assembled on the bus for away games, and the coach was calling the role, he didn't even refer to me by name.  He'd ask, "Is the girl here?" and then move on.    This man tricked me on the day the school pictures of the soccer team were taken for the yearbook, so that I did not appear in the team picture.  He'd told me the photographer was taking a picture of the boys from his league team, the Killer Bees, not for the school team.  I recognized the picture when I saw it in the yearbook. I don't have that yearbook anymore, but it seems to me I wasn't even listed as "not pictured."  I came back to the team the next year.  By that time, it was a point of pride for me.  I was not going to let him win, not going to let him drive me off the team. I vowed to try harder, hard enough that I wouldn't be just a sub. I'd played on a girl's league team by then, and even though I still wasn't a very good player, I wanted to prove myself tough enough to continue.  I played in games without shin guards, mostly because we were poor and I couldn't afford them, but I liked the "tough chick" reputation that went along with it.   I did the extra laps.  I put up with the coach's constant disappointment with us.  One day, a professional soccer player (who knew a couple of boys on the team) came to practice with us.  The coach puffed up, put his arm around me, and introduced me to the player.  "This is our girl," he said. Not that he thought any more of me that year, but I was a novelty item.  He set me up to take a shot on goal, against our best goal-keeper.  I ran forward, took a bumbling shot that was easily stopped by our goalie, and dejectedly returned to the end of the line while my coach began his usual "Noooo!  What are you doing?!" ranting at me for my ineptitude.  "Stop, come back," said the pro.  "Let her do it again," he said to my coach, who stood there with mouth agape, stopped in mid-rant.  Putting his arm around me, the pro set me up again. "Wait until your knee is over the ball this time.  You're over-extending."  This was unheard of, a second chance?  Tips and pointers?!  I was nearly as agape as the coach.    I took that second shot on goal, waited until my knee was over the ball, and curled a beautiful, solid shot right past our goalie and into the corner of the net.  "That's it!" cheered my hero, and the guys on the team joined in appreciatively.  I was on top of the world, one silly practice shot in the net later.    My perception of things changed completely in that moment.  Before that, I was sticking it out on the team out of sheer stubbornness, from some general sense that the way things were being run was unjust and unfair to the girls at the school who wanted to play soccer.  After that practice, I realized that I might be unskilled but I wasn't a lost cause, I wasn't a write-off, and that with a little genuine  coaching  I could even succeed.  The boys who had treated me indifferently the first year even came around and treated me as a friend and team mate.  They used my name and supplied it to the coach when he called me "Girl."  When we all moved up to high school, there were enough girls interested in soccer to have their own girls-only team.  I lost interest.  I'd played with the boys for two years leading up to high school, only to be told that I wasn't going to be allowed to play with them anymore: boys on the boy's team and girls on the girl's team.  I'd played with some of the girls on the league team, I knew them a little, but I grieved the loss of the hard-won camaraderie of my junior high team mates. I wasn't a strong enough player to make demands to play with the boys, and I wasn't part of the girls' world.  I moved on to other activities, and eventually played soccer on other teams in other towns when I moved away but never knew my other team members the way I knew those Ackerman Colts. I often wonder what happened in their lives: Sean, Corey, Danny, Greg, Derek, Mike, Scott, Steve, Clint...I've lost touch with every one of them.

       "Church is not God," he said. "And God is not religion."   So says former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore,  urlLink recently removed  from his post for defying the federal court rulings, at a rally to whip up support for a movement (largely based in Georgia) to post the  urlLink Ten Commandments  in public courthouses.  The  urlLink Atlanta Journal-Constitution  has an illuminating article about the brewing showdown between the federal government and the local small-town governments that are the focus of the campaign by  urlLink Ten Commandments-Georgia Inc.  (aka www.thoushalt.org) whose sole goal seems to be to "to bring awareness to judicial tyranny in this country," by demanding that they be allowed tie their religious fervor to the local government and the judicial process through public displays of text from the Bible.  I can think of a few acts of "judicial tyranny" (like the decision that we don't need to actually count all those pesky votes in an election) that really should have had citizens riled.  And yet, they pick this?  I remain baffled by it all.

      One Nation, Under God...  The  urlLink Seattle P-I  has a hilarious article in which the reporter interviews area first grade students about the  urlLink Pledge of Allegiance .  Apparently, "under God" is the only part of the pledge the little nippers understand, since they know God is the guy who lives in the sky, waiting for people to die so he can turn them into angels.  If we were to remove the under god part of the pledge, the poor little things would be left struggling over words like allegience, republic, indivisible, and liberty.  In the article, only one kid (little Amanwil Eversito) knew the pledge was about the flag.  The rest of them completely believed that "God started it," and that the pledge is a prayer to God, about God.  I suppose it's too much to ask that schools explain to the kids what they're "pledging" and why,  before  we teach them to parrot back the recitiation?

      Master and Commander  Went to see this with Kate and Chris.  Kate thought it was alternately "gross" and "boring" and Chris might have his own thoughts to share in his blog, eventually.  Myself, I was going to write up my impressions of the movie, but found that  urlLink Mr. Tynes has already beaten me to it .  He says what I was going to, right down to how refreshing it was that the main character didn't have to grow as a person or conquer his internal demons or anything besides what he was set on screen to do.  I did find myself unduly distracted by  urlLink Chaucer  (Paul Bettany) and  urlLink Pippen  (Billy Boyd) despite their excellent acting, but that's my problem, no slight to them at all. Max Pirkis is exceptional as young Midshipman Blakeney.

      Tea Cozy  Something about November makes me want to bust out the tea.  Most of the rest of the year I am a devoted coffee or cola drinker.  Iced tea I can usually take or leave, though I did get a nifty  urlLink Bodum Iced Tea jug  before they were discontinued this summer.  November 2003 began and I, as usual, ran for the tea cupboard.  When I did so, I soon realized that I could have a pot of tea every day for the next year and still likely have tea left over.  This is good news should we ever end up in a situation of war rationing  ala  World War II Britain.  Realistically, it's just an embarrassing amount of tea. The tea in my cupboard includes:     urlLink Fortnum & Mason Earl Grey Classic  Fortnum & Mason Rose Garden  urlLink Fortnum & Mason Darjeeling   urlLink Fortnum & Mason Royal Blend   urlLink Tao of Tea Rooribos   urlLink PG Tips   urlLink Republic of Tea Blackberry-Sage   urlLink Republic of Tea Cardamon-Cinnamon   urlLink Republic of Tea Ginger-Peach   urlLink Traditional Medicinals Throat Coat   urlLink Stash Herbal Sampler   urlLink Stash Vanilla Nut Creme Decaf   urlLink Stash Earl Grey Decaf   urlLink Stash Orange Spice Black Tea   urlLink Stash Chai Spice   urlLink Tazo Mambo Herbal Infusion   urlLink St. Dalfour Organic Black Cherry   urlLink St. Dalfour Organic Peppermint   urlLink Golden Moon Tea Vanilla Jasmine   urlLink Golden Moon Tea Lapsang Souchong  a few individual bags of jasmine, green tea, and ginseng  urlLink Lipton  English Blend (Chris's tea)    With this in mind, I've been making an effort to brew up a pot of tea at least several times a week.  I try to have one cup of tea every day, so as to feel less like a hoarder. It also gives me the excuse to use my tea cozy.  Much like my  urlLink tureen , I don't use it often, but I get a happy feeling when I do.  Though  urlLink Alton Brown  would no doubt cringe at the number of single-use items I have in my kitchen, I get delight out of properly applying nearly every one of them.

      Long Day  Up late last night watching TiVo'd shows when I should have been asleep.  In an effort to not let my new toy cut into my regular routine or lifestyle, I've been watching television when I would nornally be going to bed.  That won't last much longer.  Long day of people calling me on the phone, lots of answering and sorting e-mail.  The e-mail thing is tedious: setting up new filtering conditions so that my legitimate e-mails stop being flagged as junk mail, or so that mail ends up in the right folders in Entourage.  Then a trip to the post office to fill more mail orders, and a trip to the bank, where some junkie walked up to the passenger side of the car to harrass us for change while I was using the drive-up teller to deposit some checks.  Creeped me out.  Got wrapped up in spread-sheet hell, catching up on book keeping and number crunching, so Kate and I ordered pizza in while Chris had a meeting with one of our freelance editors about a vexing project turned in by freelancers this summer.  We have several outstanding issues with the manuscript and frankly, I'm tired of spending time on our end hammering and developing and stitching and correcting on these things, only to release them and for the original authors to get the credit for putting together the end result.  We've had at least half a dozen of these books pass through the company now, and I'm perfectly ready to take a hardline approach.  Very often, we get a manuscript from someone with a handful of good ideas but with poor organizational skills, or abysmal D20 ability (especially wrto stat blocks) and there have been many books where Chris has had to correct every stat block in the manuscript before it can go to print, that kind of thing.  My position recently has been, "That's Author X's problem, not ours: the manuscript should go back to them, and if Author X can't do it right or find someone to help him, then we're not going to waste our time on this project."  It certainly does make one appreciate the genuinely talented and professional people we work with, who thankfully are the majority of our freelancers!  Still, after crunching numbers for several hours, I looked up to notice that it was after 9:00pm, I'd had one piece of pizza for dinner, I had no idea what Kate had eaten and it was too late to put her in the bath. The only reason I'd looked up at that point was because Kate had come skipping down to tell me that the Good Eats sweet potato episode was on TiVo.  I smooched her and sent her off to bed, unbathed.  Tomorrow is homework day, and since her homework came home with her while I was in Columbus, I have no idea where it is, or even what it is.  Bad Mommy Points for me.

      No rest  Trying to catch up on all the things left undone while I was in Columbus last week.  An update for our Miva store came out, but everyone in the tech world assumes everyone is running PCs and it's stupidly convoluted to work through the process on the Mac.  Grr.  Trying to catch up on correspondence, only to find that my spam filter and e-mail rules are misrouting my mail: communications from printers, from Osseum, from customers writing to the customer service address are being labeled "personal" or "junk", being marked "lowest priority" so they don't show up as new mail, and other issues and I'm not sure what's causing it.  Grr again. Deadlines for GenCon SoCal, GenghisCon, GTS and Origins (!) are approaching, and I've also got to finalize wording for the Origins Awards Guidelines before the Eligibility Round goes live next week sometime.    Yes, there's much work to be done.  Nothing even vaguely interesting to blog about, I don't even have time to rant about my feelings concerning the third Matrix movie.  You guys don't need to know what I think about it, though.  There are plenty of other people who have elaborated on why it really fails, so I'll just say, "Me, too," and get back to work.

      The Birthday Day  I spent the day of my birthday alone in the house.  I made myself a cup of coffee, spent the morning playing with my TiVo, asking it to record movies with Bogart or Christopher Walken in them, subscribing to all the new episodes of  urlLink Good Eats  and  urlLink Queer Eye .  Why, out of those few shows, did I start getting notified that Episode X of one show would not record because it conflicted with Episode Y of another? Isn't it just my luck that out of the two or three shows I want to watch EVER that they're on in conflict with each other!  Bah.  I stayed off the 'net for the day, dragged myself up to north-most Washington to pick up Kate.  She'd informed her dad that she wanted to get something for me for my birthday, and the two of them asked for 20 minutes to go shopping before we exchanged.  With her father's help (obviously) Kate presented me with a DVD of  urlLink Bowling for Columbine .  Heh.  I'm greatly amused.  Kate and I went to see  urlLink School of Rock .  I was stunned when Kate told me she wanted to be the prissy little bossy boots girl who ends up as "Band Manager" until I realized that she was really the only girl given any camera time or characterization.  Who aspires to be "back-up vocalist," or "bass player who just stands there and never says anything," when you can be the smart, pretty girl who gets all the camera time? The kids in the movie are really a riot  urlLink in this interview .  Sadly, I ended the day with one of my damned "Behind the Right Eye" headaches.  By the time I went to pick Chris up at the airport, I was in awful pain and I went immediately to bed.  The headaches come on so strong, I can't to anything but lay there.  Can't open my eyes, sometimes can't even talk.  Sleep is the only escape.  Chris, bless his heart, brought me some drugs and sat on the bed with me.  I felt marginally better, at least enough to have a short conversation and hear about his trip, then I had to beg off and go to sleep.  This morning I'm headache free, but having been in such pain last night rippled tension through my face and neck and this morning I'm feeling the beginnings of a TMJ flare-up threatening.  Damn rebellious body!  I'm taking preventative measures to keep things in line.   urlLink  What a drag it is getting old...   as they say.

      Home again, home again  I woke up sweating every hour on the hour to stare at the clock, in between dreaming unhappy dreams of editing bylaws or trying to record votes to the board. I got up feeling ill-rested at 6:00am to get out to the airport and catch my morning flight home. I didn't even call our Experience Columbus host for a ride, preferring a private, quiet taxi at my own expense.  Everything went smoothly, though my purse was checked at security because my coin purse raised suspicions somehow.  It felt only the slightest irritation, so anxious was I to get home.  All aboard the aircraft, when something is discovered to be broken and in need of repair.  We're delayed about 20 or 30 minutes, but I think nothing of it and just work on finishing my novel ( urlLink Peace Like a River , by Leif Enger, a Minnesota novelist.  I am intimately familiar with the picture of life he painted in his novel, which includes reference to the Northfield Minnesota bank heist by the James Gang, and the rural realities of North Dakota and the Badlands, among other things.  Excellent book, highly recommended!).  Then, they announced our landing time of 8:55 and a ripple of worry runs up and down the aisle, as the ten passengers with the 9:10 connection to Seattle wonder what they're going to do!  I was one of those worried people, as I was not traveling at my leisure.  Not only did I have the strong desire to get home, I felt extreme anxiety about doing so within a certain block of time.  You see, Chris was leaving town for his tour of game stores in San Francisco promoting Green Ronin and our attendance at GenCon SoCal almost exactly one hour after I was scheduled to arrive in Seattle.  Not only that, but he'd had to cancel his personal debit card after someone had gotten a hold of it and made fraudulent charges with it, and I had the company credit card with me!  We planned to meet at the airport in that precious hour window of time and exchange so Chris's trip wouldn't be one of misery and deprivation. Adding more to my stress level, once Chris left town, there Kate was with no guardian in the city and no one at home to receive her after school let out!  I was not a happy woman when the flight attendants said that they would not hold the Seattle flight for us and that our best bet was to run.  Of course, I had a heavy carry-on bag and my computer with me, and I was wearing high-heeled boots.  Of course, the Minneapolis airport is freaking' HUGE and the two planes were nowhere near each other (we arrived at C35 and were departing at F14). And, of course, the moving walkways that should have been going in that direction were down for repairs.  I despaired.  Then, on a side-hall I noticed three of those carts and drivers standing around talking.  I begged a ride to Gate F14, and launched myself with no small amount of panic off the cart to the ticket checker, who then told me that there was no reason to rush, they were holding the plane.  With a huge sigh of relief, limped down the ramp and onto the plane to take my seat.  The minor drawback being that my seatback did not recline, so I was able to catch only a little sleep with my head down on my tray table.  Finally, finally, we landed in Seattle and I bolted onto the concourse and called Chris to find out where in the airport he was.  He told me he was at the Starbucks on the main concourse.  Hooray!  Making my way to the main concourse, I find the Starbucks, no Chris.  I call again.  He's at a different Starbucks.  I see a sign pointing to another Starbucks around the corner...no Chris!  Hustling through the airport, I find ANOTHER Starbucks (and a Seattle's Best Coffee) before finally coming around the corner to the Starbucks he's really at!  I don't know how many micky fricky coffee shops Starbucks runs in Sea-Tac airport, but I was beginning to feel like I was in a Woody Allen movie.  Happily, I was able to see Chris before he left town and give him the company card.  And I was just able to sit down with him for half an hour or so and relax feel at home again.  Whew, things looked much better!  The usual waiting for shuttles, picking up my car, stopping at the store, unpacking the car and bringing things into the house took up most of the time between when I left the airport and when Kate needed to be picked up from school.  I rushed home to pack her weekend bag and picked her up from school to go directly to her dad's for the weekend.  Another two hours of driving to get up there and then returning to Seattle just barely in time to meet friends at Restaurant Zoë to celebrate Christine's birthday (November 7th) and my own (November 9th).    I held up alright through dinner, but after bottles of wine, cocktails, and of course good food, I was ready to fall asleep in my sorbet.  The rest of the table intended to hook up with Rev at the ZigZag, and I'd originally intended to spend the night getting drunk and disorderly and staying the night at R&C's instead of my own empty house, but the reality of my long day caught up with me and all I wanted was to be home, in my own bed, in my footie jammies.    Which is exactly where I ended up, fast asleep by 10:30.

      Second Verse, Same as the First  Day Two in Columbus.  Still on West Coast Time, I managed to get to sleep sometime after resorting to taking Excedrin PM.  Up again for meetings all day.  Because things seemed to be getting done with such great difficulty, I did not think it was prudent for me to leave on my scheduled 5:00pm flight and changed my departure time to Friday morning, first thing. Budgets, and bylaws, and reports from staff, much discussed.  The break for lunch came as the board was in heated discussion and debate over some vote or other, so we were late arriving for the catered meal.  Normally we would have just asked to have something brought in and worked through lunch, but the catering service for the convention center wanted to "do something special" and boy, did they ever!  I was glad to have left the meeting, foodie that I am, because lunch was Steak Oscar (crab meat and baby shrimp atop a medium rare filet mignon, served with asparagus and béarnaise sauce) and an apple-berry pie with cinnamon whipped cream.  Holy overkill, batman!  Still, good food lulls even the most savage game industry savage, and the afternoon session went as smoothly as I could have hoped.  So smoothly, in fact, that I probably hadn't needed to delay my departure as much as I did.  By the time everything was over, I was tired as hell and emotionally drained, and all I wanted was to be home with my family, in my own bed.  The other board members who were staying the night tried to cheer me and keep me company, but in the end I was sad and homesick.

      Day One  Meetings, meetings, meetings.  I have to say, aside from the occasional cretinous lout, the people I've served with on the GAMA board of directors are some of the smartest, most insightful, most passionate about the industry people I've ever known.  Serving on the GAMA board has given me contact with people outside of the little clique of people I know well from my own business, and I especially appreciate the hard work of all the retail and distributors who have served as representatives.  Our current executive committee has had their noses to the grind-stone in a way that I've never seen before and in a way that is not very transparent to the membership only because of the way the by-laws are set up to control the way GAMA conducts its business.  In fact, they're working to change that very thing, to vest control of the organization within the full board and to make very *clear* to the membership who is running what.  Right now there is a lot of misunderstanding about what the organization is and what it's set up to do.  Most companies that join GAMA don't first read the by-laws; they join based on invitations from representatives of the organization or invitations from other members.  To my dismay, too much of what is "known" about GAMA is based on rumor, innuendo, and a whole generation of personal grudges...this guy hated that guy who was rumored to have harmed the business of a third guy.  Many people, not knowing how the organization is run to begin with, get a wild and twitchy at changes they associate with any of the wounds of the past.    It was a very difficult meeting.  Very productive but very difficult.  I had to bum antacids from others around the table as I developed severe stress-stomach that first day.  One fellow refused to be dissuaded from his points, even after he was the only one at the table continuing to argue.  At another point, we had a guy determined to work up a full head of steam ranting about the potential earth-shattering problems that were going to occur if Section Blank, Part Blank of the bylaws were adopted only to be told (once he finally took a breath and let the rest of the table get a word in edgewise) that his concerns were addressed on the next page.    After the end of business on Day One, the folks from Experience Columbus took us out to a Mongolian barbecue for dinner, and gave us complementary passes to see the new Matrix movie on opening day.  I'll save my review of the Matrix part three for another time

      Off again, off again, jiggity jog...  Time to go to Columbus soon.  I checked the weather in Columbus, and it's supposed to go from a high of 80 today to a high of 60-something tomorrow to a low of 34 (!) by the time I fly out on Thursday night.  That's quite a swing!  Makes packing a bit more challenging.  Must run to the post office, the bank, the drug store and then to return my videos.  I ended up going over to Ray's last night and while he and Chris played ASL, Kate and I broke in his new Finding Nemo DVD (which looked superb on Ray's giant hi-def tv), then I moved on to the end of the Maltese Falcon...and eventually Ray and Chris joined me for  urlLink High Sierra .  This means I did not get to watch Cat on a Hot Tin Roof before returning it, but maybe I'll give it a go again when I get back from Ohio.  Blogging may be sparse until I return.  Not sure what my connection situation will be while I'm away.

      Election Day  I spent election day traveling to Columbus for the fall GAMA Board meeting.  Arrived at the airport in time to bump into Rick Loomis from Flying Buffalo, freshly (or *ahem* maybe not so "freshly") in from two weeks in Europe for the  urlLink Essen  and  urlLink Eindhoven  game shows.  The fall meeting is the only meeting that doesn't take place adjacent or concurrent with other game shows (e.g., the GAMA Trade Show and Origins) and it's traditionally two solid days of work for the organization.  This year, held in Columbus (home to the Origins Convention) the people of Experience Columbus "hosted" the Board meeting, meaning along with the GAMA finance director, they arranged for hotel rooms, printing and binding the agenda and staff reports, providing meals, meetings with our liaisons at the venues and so on.  It also meant that the contact guy from Experience Columbus was picking each of the board members up at the airport, no matter what time of the day or night we were coming in.  I had the unlucky draw of a room at the Red Roof Inn, one of the convention hotels. As compared to the other hotels, the Red Roof is the sort of minimal hotel that doesn't even provide you with a complimentary bottle of shampoo.  Rick joined me for dinner, as we were both starved on our flights, and then I hooked up with a few other board members to go over some of the material for the morning meeting.  Sadly, being on West Coast Time was cruel to me.  I was unable to fall asleep before 3:30am, even with the aid of a couple of after-dinner drinks.  The meeting started in a hotel meeting room up the block at 8:00am (aka 5:00am by my body clock).  Ouch.

      TiVo, TiVo, TiVo, TiVo!  Oh,  urlLink TiVo , how I have lusted in my heart for you.  For years now, I have heard the glories of your technology.   urlLink Jeff  and  urlLink Peter  have blogged your praises; Ray and Christine have  bloop-bloop-blooped  their way through many a TiVo'd program for my viewing pleasure.  People at cocktail parties, birthday parties, Christmas parties proselytized the TiVo lifestyle with all the fervor of the newly baptized or new Atkins diet converts: "Oh, you're just the type of person TiVo is made for!  You'd  love  it. It would be  perfect  for you!"  All I could do was nod, nod, yes, it sounds wonderful, yes, yes, I'm sure I'd love and adore TiVo, agree as one on the outside longing to be let in.  No longer!  Oh bliss, oh rapture!  My beloved has gotten me my heart's desire as an early birthday present.  "I've been planning it for six months," he announced slyly when it arrived today amid a completely unrelated delivery of  urlLink books .  The only damper on my tryst with my new TiVo is that I leave tomorrow morning for meetings in Columbus, Ohio (meetings that don't have much chance of being any fun at all, considering some of the loathsome creeps also scheduled to be in attendance).  Next weekend, though, I'm spouse-free and child-free.  And then, sweet TiVo, we'll jack in and get this party started.

      I've been on an old movie kick for a while now.  Earlier his year, I rented Rebecca and High Noon from Netflix and I've been venturing back into the old black and whites off and on ever since.  I wrote last weekend about seeing North by Northwest at the cinema, but it didn't stop there: I also rented the  urlLink African Queen ,  urlLink Notorious ,  urlLink After the Thin Man ,  urlLink Spellbound  and  urlLink Double Indemnity .    I think Spellbound was the weakest of those, and that's not meant as criticism.  Bergman and Grant are a handsome couple, the characters that flesh out the scenes are hilarious, but the reliance on psycho-analysis and dream interpretation (while I'm sure fantastically cutting edge at the time) seemed dated and weak.  There are still twists and turns that make it an enjoyable movie to watch.   After the Thin Man gave me my new favorite line, uttered by William Powell as the affable drunkard and detective Nick Charles, "Let's get something to eat. I'm thirsty."  What a riot!  Ray turned me onto The Thin Man this spring, and I was completely charmed.  Though, After the Thin Man does leave the whole plotline surrounding the cheating Mrs. Asta frustratingly unresolved!  That bitch, what happens to her?!  I hadn't seen African Queen since I was a kid, and it definitely stood up to an adult viewing.  The Germans, while not Nazis, were still mighty evil and Hepburn and Bogart have plenty of fun with their characters.  Ah, spunky old Katharine Hepburn.   I rented Double Indemnity because I had missed seeing it on the big screen at the theater a couple of weeks ago. To me, Fred MacMurry was the goofball actor from  urlLink The Shaggy Dog , or maybe that guy from  My Three Sons .  Barbara Stanwyck was that shriveled old lady from  urlLink The Big Valley , which I only knew because it came on in reruns during the day when I was home sick from school...in the time slot before Bonanza (and with Lee Majors as a cowboy, not The Bionic Man!). Trying to wrap my head around a story where The Absent-Minded Professor and Victoria Barkley of The Big Valley were the stars of a serious movie kept me away from it for years.  I'm pleased to say that Double Indemnity was a fantastic movie, a hard-boiled noir classic from before "noir" was "classic" and Edward G. Robinson puts in a fine performance of his own.  I ran out of time to watch Notorious, but I've seen it before.  It was recommended to me by my dear, dear friend Darrell Smith back when I was about 16, and like much that Darrell recommended to me over the years, it's something I've come to associate as much with him and our friendship as with the quality of the movie itself.  I'm nostalgic about Notorious.  This week's rentals include  urlLink The Treasure of the Sierra Madre  (which gives me a whole new perspective on  urlLink Stinky Pete  The Prospector from  urlLink Toy Story 2 ... and I swore from the voice he was  urlLink Burl Ives  until the credits proved me wrong),  urlLink Key Largo  (man, that Lauren Bacall had a sultry voice...only 23 in that movie, and had already been married to crusty old Bogart for 3 years!),  urlLink The Maltese Falcon  (a favorite!),  urlLink Sabrina  (ok, ok, I'm on a Bogie kick, I admit it) and  urlLink Cat on a Hot Tin Roof .  I leave for Columbus on Tuesday, so we plowed through Sierra Madre and Key Largo yesterday, I'm looking to see two more today and I'll save one for Monday night.

      Snow!  Snowfall is rare here in the Seattle city limits.  Outlying areas, towns further up the foothills, get snow, but Seattle proper gets snow only very rarely.  In the few years we've owned our house, we've had just a handful of snowfalls, maybe three?  It started snowing last night after dark and I can still see a few flakes falling now.  Kate is at her dad's in Vancouver this week and all she could talk about was snow. She got a new winter coat, hat and mitts for Christmas from her easterly grandparents and I chuckled because the chances were very slim she'd get to use them here.  She gleefully brought them to Canada with her.  We saw a light layer of snow on the side of the road on the way north and she started singing about snow.  I sure hope they've gotten snow up in Vancouver, too, or I'm going to know a very disappointed little girl.  Such a shame she's missing our bi-annual snowfall.  I suspect this may make getting out of the house for our standing engagement at Jess and Kathryn's New Year's Eve party a little more difficult.  We live atop one of Seattle's infamously steep hills and in order to go in the direction we need to go, we'd need to get up and down at least half a dozen more. Guess we'll see what the afternoon holds.

      No Schedule  After a couple of days of obsessive tag-team Knights of the New Republic playing, Chris, Kate and I joined our newly married friends for a little celebration of the event, over killer meatloaf from Cook's Illustrated (tender, delicious, and wrapped in bacon), green beans, salad, bread, and wine.  Yum, yum, I love having friends who know how to eat well!  While Kate amused herself over hotdogs and Harry Potter, we all laughed it up over more wine, then a dessert course of cheese, sherry, and some goodies I brought along from my stash.  Received several compliments on how great Kate handles herself in "adult party" situations, which is always wonderful to hear.  No one wants to be the parent of the kid who is a drag to have around!  Kate has been extremely sweet and good-natured, and her natural animal empathy is a bonus.  Friends who have pets that don't normally like strange people (let alone strange children) are consistently amazed that their pets willingly come up to Kate and investigate her, sometimes even allowing themselves to be petted and played with.  Kate desperately wants a cat or dog of her own who will snuggle up in her bed with her, but allergies and our nutty travel schedule keep us from having any warm furry animals for her to love...the pets of friends are the best we can offer.  Eventually, Kate and I crashed out in the spare room.  I awoke at 6:30am to find the boys still up, chatting away, completely unaware that the entire night had passed!  Wacky.  Thankfully, Chris has roused himself from his afternoon of slumber, because we have plans to meet another friend for dinner.  This fellow is a former regular member of our game group, and we haven't seen him since his going away party some years ago now, when he left Seattle for the wilds of Edmonton, to (coincidentally) go to work for Bioware.

      Holly Days  Had a nice visit with my brother and sister-in-law. They left today for Chicago, where they're spending time with Angie's sister.  They had originally agreed to drive from Chicago to Florida with A's sister and kids, so she wouldn't have to make the trip alone, but as it turns out A's sis's husband can make the trip after all, so now there is no room in the vehicle for everyone and Chad and Angie are left to rent a car and drive to Florida on their own.  The price of being nice!  It was nice to see them, though I fell asleep too early after a day of early waking, too much driving, and a belly full of good food.  Even my mother's husband was acceptible and decent enough company!  Gifts were exchanged, Kate received a bounty (including a new guitar!), and we even spent a little time playing games together in true family tradition.  Kate won a game of Farkle by 5000 points.  On the way back to Seattle I stopped at a Borders and bought  urlLink Across the Nightingale Floor  on CD and listened to the first two and a half hours of the story on the drive home while Kate and Chris took turns sleeping.  It's a wonderful story so far, and the readers they have doing the narration (one male, one female) are excellent.  I listened to the last half of the third CD today while I puttered around in the kitchen.  I'm very much enjoying it.  Watched a bit of Tivo last night when we got home:  urlLink The Caine Mutiny .  Both Chris and I thought it was really not a very good movie, despite the four star rating Tivo gave it.  Bogart took a bit of a different role for him, but I found the movie confusing at best, utterly unengaging at worst, and I can't understand the high regard people seem to have for it.  We watched the  urlLink Kid Notorious  Christmas episode (I'm really enjoying that wacky show, especially when  urlLink Donald Rumsfeld  and his turtle, Mr. Pickles,  urlLink make appearances ) and later Kate and I watch  urlLink Suspicion , which I'd seen before.  Nothing like Hitchcock, even "lesser Hitchcock" like Suspicion, to wash away the bad aftertaste of a bad film. I quite enjoyed watching Kate trying to figure out what was going on.  Tonight it will be  urlLink 12 Angry Men , I think.  Today we all finished our Christmas shopping.  Kate and I went off in one direction, Chris in another.  We intended to meet up down town at Nikko for sushi, but when Chris arrived he discovered they were "closed for business" which sounds both ominous and permanent.  We settled for I Love Sushi instead.

      Christmas Craft Craziness  I've finished the gift baskets for my family.  They include all sorts of foodstuffs that I made myself, plus crafty things that Kate helped with.  Strawberry-Port Wine preserves (made this fall with strawberries from the farmer's market), caramelized honey with anise, Mediterranean herb oil (both recipes from the December issue of Bon Appétit), confetti bean soup (dried beans layered in a jar, with a recipe), chocolate-walnut rum balls, mocha kaluha balls, and citrus balls in a little box I decorated with ribbon, cinnamon-scented pine cones, and a Christmas ornament made from Kate's school photos.  Kate also made book marks to include.  I have several plates of rum balls, cherry-chocolate fudge, and maple-walnut fudge, plus home made rosemary cheese crackers that turned out really great.  I have ingredients for making mounds bar cookies, cherry-walnut bars, and a second sort of cheese cracker, but didn't get around to those.  I do so enjoy crafty projects like this, I went a little crazy. Note to my friends: you may be getting fudge from me for Christmas this year! Am seriously considering bringing a whack of this stuff down to the fire station for Christmas, just to thin out my supply a bit!  I really need to go see RotK again when I'm not feeling sick.  Getting that splitting headache during the movie really ruined it for me, and I find myself looking back on the experience and being unable to come up with any impressions of the film or the story other than "Gah, when will this be over so I can crawl into bed and die?"  I wish the movie had done a better job of explaining why Denethor was so bug-fuck crazy and why it took our heroes so long to figure it out.  I need to go back and watch it again to see if the pacing was as bad and the overall story as disjointed as my headache led me to believe.  The massive fight scenes did little for me, mostly because it was just a lot of anonymous guys fighting.  My recollection is that the film gives you very little reason to care what's happening if it's not happening to the members of the Fellowship; each battle includes a brief cut of a second-string character that you "know" (Theoden, Faramir) and then a lot of other utterly anonymous guys being cut down in battle after battle after battle. Kate saw this in the theater with us (the first one she's seen on the big screen) and said at least twice, "When are they going to get back to the ghosts?" And for some reason, the repetitive little "The King Has Appeared On Screen" and "The Fellowship Has Advanced to the Next Scene" musical snippets from the score REALLY bothered me this time out.  Yes, I see, it's Aragorn.  Yes, they've beaten this scene's monster/villain.  If I never hear those eight over-used notes again, it will be too soon.  Argh.  Well, I'm off to Portland to deliver gift baskets of goodies.

      Return of the King  Went to see Return of the King last night, but halfway through came down with such a bad headache I just wanted to curl up and die right there in the theater.  Took some of the fun out of it for me, that's for sure.  Went directly to bed when we got home.  Kate and I are working on finishing up some of our Christmas to-dos tonight.  We're heading down to visit my brother this weekend for "early Christmas" because he and his wife are heading out of town to visit her folks or something this year, so I need to get things finished up!  Coming down with whatever it is that Chris caught at GenCon isn't making that any easier.

      GenCon SoCal  So, aside from my unpleasant experience on the flight, GenCon SoCal was definitely a success for Green Ronin. I feel badly for the people who worked booths that didn't get as much traffic, and for those who brought gigantic booths and too much stock, and so suffered with massive union fees.  We knew about the union and the drayage but didn't expect the raping to be so bad; that was the one real downside to the convention. $600 to move one pallet of product to our booth, plus our display.  OUCH.  Thursday was very sparsely attended, but not entirely dead.  People attended the events that we sponsored, there was some modest traffic by the booth, but the aisles were also empty enough that Kate was able to turn cartwheels to amuse herself without bashing into anyone.  Combined with the harshness of the set-up charges, many exhibitors seemed to be in a panic about what the convention held for them.  Thursday night my mom flew in to spend the weekend with Kate.  YAY mom!  I gave her a tour of the hall on Friday and then she and Kate spent the day at Disneyland. When Chris and I went back to the hotel for the hour between his last seminar and our dinner meeting, they still weren't back!  Good stamina, mom!  Friday the hall was noticeably more crowded (it would have been hard not to be) and sales were much improved for us.  This gave me hope for the weekend, so I didn't fret too much about where we were in terms of sales by the end of Friday.  Friday night we joined a group of game industry folks for a fine, fine meal in Downtown Disney (the shopping strip between Disney's theme parks).  Saturday when we arrived at the convention center there were people in line at event registration, and a crowd waiting for the dealer's area to open.  Saturday sales were much more brisk and much more in line with what I'd expect for a strong regional convention.  Not quite as good as Origins, but better than DunDraCon (which has always been a decent show the times I've attended).  We didn't have too many people attend our seminar, but then it wasn't listed in the summary of seminars, so I'm not surprised.  We had many people come by to tell us they were excited about the Red Star announcement, and many people who came by to tell us that one or another game they'd played had been great fun.  TS Luikart and John Polack did a great job of running their events and getting people excited.    Sunday was a typical Sunday, with bursts of sales as people made last minute purchases and then lots of down time.  The GenCon LLC folks announced that there was going to be a collection for Toys for Tots of LA, which had only received a fraction of its usual donations this year.  We ended up donating most of the rest of our remaining stock from the booth, three large boxes worth.  (Chris says he hopes the "Tots" are old enough to be roleplayers!)  I didn't get out to examine any of the gaming or seminars that were offered.  There was a special session of the Live Dungeon that was being held for exhibitors after hours, and I heard from people who had a fantastic time and from those who didn't enjoy themselves at all, so I guess reviews are mixed but it sounded like a neat idea to me.  I did have a chance to see some old friends (thanks, Mystery Reader, for the CD of baby pictures!) including having coffee for an hour with fellow-former-Minnesotan Jeff Tidball, who has been sucked back into the game industry via Decipher and The Lord of the Rings RPG.  Mike Pondsmith and I made our annual vow to get together in Seattle instead of seeing each other only at conventions, I saw a very relaxed-and-happy-looking Mark Simmons who seems to be enjoying his retirement from his GAMA Executive Director job.  Honestly, GenCon exceeded my expectations for a first-time convention in that location, at that time of year.  I think the convention has a chance to really grow into something, but it will take a few years to really take hold.  I worry that next year they may suffer a backlash from exhibitors who didn't do as well as Green Ronin did, or those who suffered particularly at the hands of the union, but if those hurdles can be overcome I think there is every reason to support GenCon SoCal.  I think it will do better if people in the region really accept the idea of a four-day convention event as a destination and a thing to do rather than just something you drop by to see for a day.  It was far, far from a "failure" just by virtue of having even 3000 people attend, in my opinion.  I've certainly been to dead, dead, dead conventions where there were less than a dozen people in the dealer's room at any given time, for example.  It's not GenCon, it's not Origins, but SoCal is off to a good start and it's certainly got my support.

      Inauspicious Beginning  Those of you who just saw me at GenCon SoCal have heard this one already, but it's too outrageous not to share again.  Alaska Airlines can officially kiss my ass.  When I made my reservations on Alaska to fly to GenCon SoCal, I used the seat selection tool online to select seats for the three of us together in Row 10.  By the time we showed up at the ticket counter to check in, we were no longer seated together, and we'd been moved to the back of the plane, Kate sitting by herself in one row and Chris and I together across the aisle and in the last row of seats.  The woman at the counter couldn't help us, but suggested that we try at the gate.  We arrived at the gate not quite two hours before our flight and there was no one staffing it yet, no one available to help us.  We decided to have lunch.  When we returned from having lunch, the guy at the counter said that he also could not help us.  The person sitting in the seat we wanted had supposedly already checked in and had "already boarded" so we were told to deal with it on board the plane.  We boarded and made our way to the back of the plane.  When we got there, the row was empty!  I said to the flight attendant standing there, "Do you think it will be a problem to seat us all together in the last row instead of split up like we are now?"  Her response, "Yes, I think it will be.  We're just going to have to wait and see." I was surprised and a bit irritated, but Kate and I sat down in the seats and Chris remained standing to wait.  He decided to use the bathroom while we were waiting.  While Chris was in the bathroom and Kate and I were sitting there, I turned to the attendant and said, in a conversational way, "You know, when we booked these seats we were all together up in Row 10.  I don't even know how we ended up back here."  I swear, that's all I said and I did not say it in any way that was adversarial, I did not raise my voice, I did not do anything whatsoever to provoke what happened next.  The flight attendant went off completely and started to angrily lecture me.  Maybe I would like to set a better example for my daughter and stop pouting and having my temper tantrum, she said. She had already told me she was going to help me, and she had the power to help me, but not if I was going to be "uncooperative" and the more I pouted and threw tantrums the bigger problem we were going to have.  Maybe I would like to take a different flight, she said.  I was stunned.  I tried to maintain my cool.  "I haven't even begun to throw a tantrum here," I said, "and I most certainly do NOT want to take another flight."  That made her even more angry and agitated, and I tried to end the conversation by saying, "I think we should stop talking about this. I would prefer not to talk about it anymore," which threw her into a complete rage.  She said, "That's IT.  I think you need to take a different flight. They don't pay me to put up with this garbage," and she stalked off to the back of the plane, where she got on the phone to the front cabin and reported that she had a disruptive passenger in the back.  All in the time it took Chris to go to the bathroom.  At no time did I raise my voice, speak rudely to her, yell, cry, curse, storm around, or in any other way cause a disturbance!  I was in complete shock.  When Chris came out of the bathroom, I tried to talk quietly to him about it, since he had no idea anything had happened.  I tried to bring it up in a delicate way, so as not to freak out the attendant any further, and said quietly, "Honey, there may be a problem.  You can Kate may have to go on ahead, I may have to take a different flight," because at this point I was completely expecting security to show up and haul me off the plane at any moment.  Chris, obviously, was blindsided and confused.  I think his response was, "What? What's going on?" at which point our psychotic flight attendant launches herself into the conversation, railing about my attitude and telling him that she was doing "everything humanly possible" to help us and I just wouldn't leave the situation alone.  At this point I was genuinely angry, but still trying to hold it together so as not to provoke airline security.  I protested, "I'm just sitting here!  I haven't said anything!" and she retorted, "You're saying something now."  I blurted out, "I was talking to my husband." She said, "I  was  going to let that little aside pass, but I can see there's no point..." and I quickly said,  "I thought he should know that he might have to go on ahead without me."  She angrily said, "Oh, is THAT how it's going to be?  Let's just go and arrange that! I don't need another two hours of this garbage."  Next to me, Kate began to whimper that she didn't want me to have to take a different flight. The other attendant she'd called from the front arrived at this point to ask if there was a problem, and Chris and I both insisted there was NO problem. I ended up swearing that I would not say a word for the rest of the flight. The snarky stewardess said, "We're still deciding," and curtly told Chris to please take his assigned seat.  I honestly did not know, until the plane pulled away from the gate, if I would be hauled off the plane by security or if I would be allowed to take my flight. I did not say another word to anyone, I was afraid to even open my mouth to ask for a drink.  It would not have surprised me one bit to have found security waiting to meet me at the plane in Orange County, the way that woman was acting.  With things the way they are these days, I did not even make a snarky comment to anyone as we exited, I just bit my tongue and took it.  Meanwhile, in Chris's row, he ended up sitting next to a retired Alaska Airlines flight attendant, who quietly told him that he needed to get that woman's name and write a complaint letter, that her conduct was unprovoked and completely out of line.  The attendant had been wearing a name tag during the whole confrontation, but after we took off she and the other attendant who'd come to the back took their name tags off!  Chris took notes on their appearances, and noted the name of the attendant who'd remained uninvolved, so in our complaint we can say that it was NOT Jennifer who was involved in this ordeal.  Now, I understand that flight attendants need to be empowered to deal with rowdy, disruptive, belligerent passengers.  I was none of those things!  I was not rude, I did not curse, I did not rant, yell, threaten, cry, or cause a scene in any way.  I was forced to quietly submit to treatment that was nothing short of abusive, my daughter was terrorized into thinking that her Mommy was going to be removed from the plane, at the hands of the very person I was told to discuss my problem with.  Alaska Airlines WILL be hearing from us about this.  Thankfully, our flight home was pleasant as could be.  We were all seated together in the bulkhead row, no problems.  Our flight attendant on that flight, Wendy, was perfectly sweet, polite, and attentive.  She got Kate a complementary coloring book, she checked to see if we needed drinks or needed anything from the overhead bin, and she wished us happy holidays. Much different than the horror show of our flight down.

      Galactica, Part Two  Hrmph.  I was all set to like this, too.  It ended on a bad note, much too much like an episode of the X files for my tastes.  Starbuck and Boomer as chicks I could handle.  Even "the new cylons look like us, down to the blood!" part I could handle. The kid named Boxie, they almost had to do a kid named Boxie.  But when they got to "...and they may not even KNOW they're cylons...sleeper agents could be ANYWHERE," [cue ominous music,  dah duh, ] I felt my enthusiasm for the whole show up to that point just deflate.  Maybe I'm just too cynical for these things anymore.  We're headed for the airport and GenCon SoCal this afternoon.  Sunny and 60° sounds a lot better than 39° and raining, if nothing else.  I'll try to blog from the con, with updates for those who can't be there.  We're making an announcement at the show that we're pretty darn pleased about, for starters.

      Battlestar Galactica  Caught the first episode of the new  urlLink Battlestar Galactica  tonight.  I must say that for all the  urlLink howling from the original BG fans , and the unhappiness Richard Hatch has expressed, I thought it was a fine "reimagining" of the campy, moralistic original series.  Just as Starbuck and Apollo's feathered hair and capes represented the disco-ball sensibilities of the '70s, the cigar-chomping tough-chick Starbuck and estranged, conflicted Apollo represent the sensibilities of the '00s.  The acting was fine, the special effects were delicious, the homages were fun, and I can't wait to see what happens tomorrow.

      Baby Zoey  Evan stopped by to pick some things up before we leave for GenCon SoCal on Wednesday and brought with him the 3-D ultrasound pictures of his soon-to-be-born daughter, Zoey.  You could make out tons of features, her tiny fingers, each pudgy little hand, her nose and eyelids and hair.  The result was just like they'd actually been able to stick a camera right in the womb with her (although I'm betting Rona is glad it didn't  feel  like that).  As Kate said, "It looks like the door opened a little and there's light shining through on her."  It was really, really cool.  I wish they'd had that kind of technology when Kate was in utero.  I didn't even get a regular ultrasound picture to keep!   Edit: You can see some of the Zoey pictures by following the link to  urlLink FrogTaco Blog.

      Persistent Vegetative State  Back in the early 90s I first heard of the condition known as  urlLink persistent vegetative state . This is the official term for what is people often refer to as "life as a vegetable." A stroke or a brain injury puts you in a coma, and you stabilize at a point of mostly unconsciousness without evidence of higher brain function, ability to communicate, or hope of recovery. I was so horrified at the thought, I immediately wrote up a statement that I carried around in my wallet for years, stating that I did not want to be kept alive through sustained interventions, including feeding tubes and rehydration.  It's the "hope of recovery" part that hangs people up most of the time.  Everything hinges on that hope of recovery.  If you have hope of recovery, even partial recovery, things are different! Patients with terminal illnesses and the elderly in the last stages of their lives will often have a "DNR" (Do Not Recessitate) order in their files.  When their bodies fail, treatment is withheld and they are allowed to die rather than employing medical technology to wring life briefly back into them. Medical ethicists have drawn the line at withholding treatment.  It's ethical not to begin a treatment (especially one that has questionable effect on the patient's quality of life) but they have decided it is less ethical to stop a treatment once it's begun.  Back to the hope of recovery issue, of course we want our doctors to do whatever they can to save us and our loved ones in time of injury and illness.  They decide our hope of recovery after they've tried their treatments, and stories of miraculous recoveries keep hopes alive through it all. Once treatments are begun, it becomes unethical to stop them.  Eventually, we arrive at the conclusion: they've done all they can, they can do no more, recovery stops, and this is your new life.  The condition has been in the news again recently because of the case in Florida of  urlLink Terri Schiavo , who has been lingering in this state for over a decade.  Her husband says she wouldn't have wanted to live like this and requested to have her feeding tube removed.  Her parents and sibling say she's not the vegetable everyone thinks she is, and if she just "had a chance" to recover, she could be brought back to a more conscious existence, be taught to eat again, and her husband is just trying to bump her off so he can be rid of her.  Make no mistake, this is a terrible situation.  I hope never to have to face such heartbreaking decisions in my own life.  In Terri's parents' place, I don't know what I would do. Could I bear to see my sweet girl lingering in half-death, nothing of what makes her  her  left but the shell she came in?  Could I live with myself if I didn't do everything humanly possible to protect her as long as there was the faintest spark of life left in her body?  Terri's husband has been portrayed unkindly, as disloyal and loathsome for having gone on with his life, having a girlfriend and a child.  I can sympathize with him, I can't bring myself to blame him for not putting himself into a state of suspended animation, ready to pick up again where things left off in 1990 if that miracle should happen and his wife suddenly return. I could never ask that of my spouse.   Those who oppose Michael Schiavo's actions include a woman who narrowly avoided having her tubes removed and eventually recovered from her state: a state that lasted 10 weeks, not 13 years, they're reluctant to admit. In the Schiavo case, the Florida legislature stepped in to override the husband's right to make decisions concerning his wife's care and the cessation of her treatments by passing "Terri's Law."  They claimed they had the right to do this because Terri Schiavo left no written instructions or told anyone other than her husband her wishes.  I have told my husband my wishes.  For the record, let me share with the rest of the world as well: I do not wish to be kept alive, in a persistent vegetative state, a state I consider to be a lingering half-death.  I do not want to be fed and rehydrated for years on end.  I do not claim to have the ability to speak to whether it is right or wrong for anyone other than myself: for myself, I do not wish to be kept alive just because those who loved me cannot bear to allow me to die.  I do not feel morally justified in consuming the massive resources in skilled care, food, medicine, and straight dollars that keeping me alive as a lingering shell would take.  Please, spend those resources on someone with a chance for a fuller life!  I'm an organ donor, so if I've got to go, I hope to at least give my liver, my kidneys, my corneas, whatever I have to give, to those who wait so desperately for them.  Don't leave me in a bed somewhere lingering until my wasted organs eventually fail.  Please love me enough to just let me go.

      Busy Social  Whew, I'm beat.  Bruce has recently relocated to greater-Seattle and now that he's in our area, we decided to get together.  He was planning to be at  urlLink GenCon SoCal  until he took this new job, but since he starts Monday that's unfortunately out of the question.  Boo, too bad about that.  Anyway, we got together with Bruce, Tim, and Randy Greer (who drove up from SF with Bruce).  First we had lunch together at the  urlLink Columbia City Ale House , and chatted away part of the afternoon.  Since neither car would hold five adults, we then took two cars up to the U District to investigate Bruce's cousin's newly opened chai shop.  I had a Mt. Baker, a sweet and cinnamony creamy delight.  Yum!  The shop was virtually empty when we first arrived, but as we hung out there many people did cycle in and out of the place.  I hope Bruce's cousin, whose name I didn't catch, has a very prosperous business.  After that, it was a jaunt up to  urlLink Fire and Sword Hobbies  near Northgate Mall.  Fire and Sword is an interesting store, half miniatures games and half replica weapons and armor.  Tim and I arrived well ahead of Bruce, Chris, and Randy, and when we walked in there were several young teens and pre-teens in the store, painting and congregating.  There had also recently been a Warhammer tournament that was just breaking up.  The store is tidy, the kids and parents who were there were clearly regulars, but it definitely did not have a "club-house" feel.  The fellow on staff greeted us when we came in, asked us if we needed any help as we milled around, and checked to make sure we were finding anything we needed, but didn't hover.  Exactly my kind of customer attention. It looks like the store is doing most of its business selling Games Workshop, though they also have a nice selection of  urlLink Osprey books ,  urlLink Vallejo paints ,  urlLink DBM , and some  urlLink Wargames Foundry  blisters.  The Foundry blisters were marked down, mostly Napoleonics. I guess the kids just don't appreciate quality. Finally the other guys showed up, and we looked around for a while more, then ended up getting drawn into a conversation with a knowledgeable gamer (who, at least at one time, hung out on EN World) when he heard us talking about GenCon SoCal.  He and Chris talked for quite a while about Chainmail and D20, but eventually we wound things up and split.    I thought we might go home, but then we decided to visit  urlLink Copper Sky  (right next door) and have dinner before breaking up. Somehow I managed to spend 9 hours, roaming around Seattle and talking, talking, talking.  Goodness we can talk!    It's nice to have old friends in the neighborhood.  I look forward to more social weekends like this.

      Wind storm and gall bladder  Tonight was supposed to be gaming night, but J&K had friends in town, and it took Evan over two hours to get from his job on the east side to his home in north Seattle, so once he got there he wasn't into leaving again.  Between our place in the mid-Seattle and the east side lies some big lake or other, and when the wind picks up (they're talking gusts of 60 MPH here, and worse the farther into the foothills you go) the water whips up over the two highway bridges that cross the span.  Rick's hardcore, though.  He showed up and had a little of my homemade smoked turkey and wild rice soup, and now it looks like they're breaking out the Settlers card game.  Meanwhile, my stomach is acting up again. My symptoms are very much like those described by friends who have had gall bladder problems, which was definitely not the first prossible problem that came to mind!  But Christine planted the seed of the idea while we were talking last weekend, and after I checked it out with friends I knew who'd had gall bladder troubles of their own, they've encouraged me to at least get things looked at.    Of course, this is where being self-employed really sucks, because despite the fact that I have some insurance coverage for catestrophic events, the rest of my medical comes straight out of my pocket, albeit at a slightly discounted rate.  That means, if I'm going to spend $200 cash money, right now, out of my pocket, I'd better be really damn sick.  I do NOT want to go in to get checked, spend 5 minutes seeing my doctor and having her tell me I need more fiber in my diet or something simple at that price.  I'm still paying off the $120 bill from Kate's visit for antibiotics a while back!  The worst of it is not knowing, of being completely torn about what to do.  I miss the peace of mind tha came with living in Canada!  When I lived in Canada, we paid the top of the premium scale for coverage and that was that, we had insurance.  If I had, I dunno, a rash, I didn't have to try to self-diagnose first.  I could go to the walk in clinic, spend the same 5 minutes, and not have to spend the next several months paying off that debt.  I could get treatment early, lessening the impact of my illness on everyone.  I know the Canadian system isn't perfect. I knew a guy who hurt his knee and had to wait an obscenely long time to have surgery, for example.  But I'm generally healthy and never had anything but the best care while I lived in Canada, including for through my entire pregnancy and childbirth. What a luxury basic health care seems now!

      What is it with the South?  I really do feel like the Southern United States is a strange and hostile foreign country sometimes.  I grew up about as "Northern" as you can get, born so far north that we were nearly in Canada.  I was raised to believe in tolerance, equal treatment, hard work, fair play, getting ahead in your life through your own gumption, doing unto others as you would have done to you, and leaving people who weren't hurting you alone even if you didn't agree with them.  I understood these to be "American values."  I lived in Georgia for about 18 months or so.  I worked temp jobs doing phone surveys for Southern Bell, as a clerk at the Winn Dixie in Duluth, as a "children's book editor" for a fly-by-night company that paid temp workers minimum wage to check out children's books from the library and retype "facts" about states which they then printed off (single sided), spiral bound, and sold to school libraries.  Ug, that was a terrible job.  I worked the temp jobs so that I could subsidize my "real job" of working for Lion Rampant/White Wolf through the first printing of Vampire: the Masquerade. Someone else was recently telling me they knew "Employee Number Three" at White Wolf, someone I knew because he came in after I'd already put in my year and a half in Georgia.  Apparently those of us who moved down, lived in poverty, subsidized the company with our own outside jobs, we don't count as Employees Number One, Two, Three, or Four anymore.  Heh.  But I digress...  I was miserable in Georgia, mostly because of my working conditions and my incompatibility with most of the people around me.  I spent one tormented birthday at a restaurant with my "friends" who spent the whole night loudly berating me for being a "bleeding heart liberal." And this was in relatively liberal and cosmopolitan Atlanta, not like I was in Tinyville, Alabama. In the four years I spent living in Vancouver, BC, I never felt nearly as  foreign  and  unwelcome  as I did in my year and a half in Georgia.  Even now, things most shocking to my sensibilities continue to originate from the southern states. Things like:  urlLink Alabama's ban on vibrators , which still stuns me that anyone can support. Or the southern states' steadfast determination not to repeal their laws  urlLink banning sodomy , solely so they can selectively enforce the law against gays while all the frat boys at Georgia Tech can still get their knobs polished. Or how about this: a seven-year-old boy being disciplined at school  urlLink in Louisiana  for using "foul language" and "behaving inappropriately" because he told a classmate he has two mommies and explained what "gay" means. Guess what?  Being forced by administrators to write "I will not say the word GAY at school ever again" over and over isn't going to make this boy have a mommy and a daddy instead of two mommies, it's only punishing him for something no more under his control than the color of his eyes.  These issues go right to the heart of my values: selective enforcement of laws, or laws meant to restrict some people but not others are neither equal treatment nor fair play. Punishing people for what they do in the privacy of their own homes, how they structure their families and their lives, is not doing unto others, and it most certainly isn't leaving people who aren't hurting you alone.

      "Liberal" Talk Radio  I laughed out loud when I saw the headlines.  "The  urlLink new network is being assembled  to counter the influence Rush Limbaugh and other conservative commentators have on the American electorate.   It will never work.  Liberals are not mean enough. Liberal radio is the softball  urlLink Fresh Air with Terry Gross  (on that institution most hated by conservatives,  urlLink NPR ). Rush Limbaugh and his ilk have been preaching their intolerance, whipping up anger and indignation, ranting about immigrants and minorities and drug abusers and welfare moms who own *gasp* microwave ovens (available for $40 at  urlLink Wal*Mart ) for more than a decade. Ann Coulter has taken the shrill and vicious rhetoric to a whole new level and has best-selling books to show for it. Even if a "liberal" version of this tripe was marketed, who would want to listen?  People who listen to conservative talk radio want to be outraged.  They want to feel morally superior to the "feminazis" and have a chance to tell those commie peace protesters they'd better move to Russia where they belong.    I suppose a radio version of  urlLink The Daily Show  could be entertaining, but is that really going to "counter the influence" of any of these shows? For every one Al Franken the conservatives can point to, they've got dozens of Michael Medveds on their side.  More and more often, when it comes to political discourse I agree completely with  urlLink David Neiwert .  In this very long essay I've linked to, in particular, he hits on the particular unease I've been feeling.  For much of this year, I was reading the blog of  urlLink Damelon Kimbrough , an American game industry associate of mine who emmigrated to France a couple of years ago.  Damelon's take on the politics of the last year or so was interesting, especially considering his perspective as an American in France, but what I found most intersting was that Damelon held many of the same opinions on some of the big issues as I did, even though we'd discovered years earlier that we came from opposite ends of the political spectrum.  I like to think he came to the same conclusion because it was the right conclusion...but what was more astounding, more refreshing, was that he was exhibiting a basic decency, even on issues where we held differing opinions.  It was notable not because I expected Damelon to lack decency but because exhibiting decency in political discussion had become so damned rare.  We have no "discourse" about issues in America these days.  It's all shrill finger-pointing and accusing dissenters of "treason" (thank you Ann Coulter, you foul harpy) and irrational "If you are against X, you love Saddam!" bullshit that spins my head.  Unfortunately, Damelon has put his blog on hiatus, and will likely not return for more political commentary in the future, which is a damn shame.  I'm trying to imagine a scenario where launching "liberal talk radio" could contribute anything good to this situation, and I just can't.

      End of the Year = Cleaning House  For many people, the end of the calendar year is a time of reflection, a time to renew your resolve, a time for goal-making, reconnecting with friends, taking stock of your life.  Out with the old, in with the new!  "Cleaning house" in everything but the literal sense.  I've spent many Decembers contemplating where I am, what has come, what lies ahead.  Rarely does the approaching New Year ever lead me to substantial change or full-blown "progress" but not for lack of opportunity.  My friend Jess does things like earnestly vow before all his friends that he's going to accomplish A or Z, which leads him to do things that I cringe to even begin, such as running in the Portland Marathon this year.  Shortly before Thanksgiving, in the cold and pouring rain, the sum of my debt to the house slammed home.  I stood on the front porch as a torrential waterfall flooded over my clogged gutters and down the front steps.  There was no way to leave the house without passing through this waterfall of icy November rain.  After taking Kate to school through it, I returned home and realized it was up to me to stop the flood.  Inside the garage, the ladder was inaccessible because of the household debt: boxes of product and packing peanuts for the mail order, items relocated to the garage because there was no room in the house for them, suitcases, battle boards, all in front of the ladder I needed.  I ended up outside, clinging to the porch posts, digging cold mucky leaves out of the rain-filled gutters, scratching my arms on pokey metal bits, water running down the inside of my coat sleeves, paying with interest and realizing how much more paying I was going to have to do.    Instead of letting my brain occupy itself with more of the same navel-gazing I'm already prone to do, and somewhat in honor of the last bit of 2003, I've been doing some genuine, bona fide house cleaning.  It began with the filing project (after the gutters were clear).  I have a dauntingly large amount to do on that one, but it's a work in progress and I was deeply heartened by being able to see the substantial dent in the job I've already accomplished.  With the help of my beloved, I've also been making progress on keeping the kitchen counters clean, the dishwasher and washing machine in constant cycle.  Several years worth of old magazines that had been "filed" haphazardly around the house have now been put into organized magazine racks and shelved on new shelves thanks to Chris's hard work and IKEA.  I can see the top of the mule chest and the bottom of the laundry hamper.  My Christmas cards are signed, sealed, and addressed.  These are all very small things, of course.  The debt I owe to the house is much like credit card debt in that it compounds in a very negative way.  One meal's dishes left dirty on the counter can easily multiply, needing to be paid back with interest down the road.  One evening spent doing "just one more thing" for the company is not without its price.  Chris and I have both found that neither of us alone can do it all (or get away with doing nothing) but when we work as a team, we have real forward momentum.  Out with the old!  (In with the new only if the new really needs to be here.)

      Cold Mountain and Cold Night  Chris and I saw Cold Mountain tonight.  I had read the novel, but Chris had not.  We both enjoyed the movie very much.  J.D. had me all worried about the casting choices for the roles, with his strenuous objections to Renee Zelwegger in particular ringing in my head.  It didn't matter that he'd ultimately seen the movie and taken back much of what he supposed would be wrong, I couldn't fully shake the negative voice of his early pre-release criticisms.  Happily for me, though, I was still able to greatly enjoy the film.  I'd forgotten enough of the details of the story that even though I knew how it ended, certain scenes and characters were pleasant surprises.  Surprises isn't exactly the word I'm looking for, though.  The scenes and characters were things I'd known and enjoyed, but forgotten, so that the feeling they evoked in me was like running into an old friend unexpectedly only to fall immediately into a feeling of familiarity and recognition.  Two hours and thirty-five minutes passed like nothing.  On the way home from the theater, we were nearly to our house when we hit a hole in the road around some construction.  The corner of the metal plate in the road came up and hit the bottom of my car and the impact was HARD.  Next thing I know, lights are coming on on the dashboard, the "fuel cutout" light lit up, and the engine lost power and stalled out.  SHIT.    Luckily for us, we'd already come through the long, dark, scary stretch between the theater and our house and were very close to home on a well-lit street.  Chris walked to the top of the hill to the police station to see if he could report the hole in the road, and I called AAA and waited for them to arrive.  In the time Chris was gone, three separate police cars stopped to check that I was ok and had someone coming to assist me.  One particularly helpful officer told me to definitely file an accident report with the city and that the city was responsible for the repairs to my car in this situation.  Boy, I hope that's the case!  Chris came back, after being unable to actually find any police officers at the station, and we waited out in the cold (near freezing temperatures and a light wind) for about 45 minutes before the tow truck driver arrived and towed us the 8 blocks or so to the top of the hill and home.  Of course, we leave on a week-long business trip Monday morning!  Oh man, what timing for this to happen.  Still, I'm not going to complain too loudly.  At least we made it home without being sprayed by a skunk!

      The Thanks We Get  In case anyone has the illusion that getting into the game industry is just a fun, creative, rewarding career (making up for the long hours and the relatively modest wages), I thought I would share with you a great little piece of hate mail (selectively edited, because it amuses me).  Yes sir, it's a happy, fun little business we have here, making games.  You know, games.  Made up, pretend, for "fun" and pleasure...    Below is the result of your feedback form.  It was submitted by David  "Played D&D for 20 years" Howarth (bgates@microsoft.com)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  message: I read the first couple paragraphs of the {Product} preview, and it just plain sucks.  Not only do you miss the have the {Imaginary Character} holding {phallic object} in his "primary hand" (a {phallic object} is a two-handed weapon, you stupid fucks), you get the feel and mood of {Imaginary Location} entirely wrong.  Glad you put a preview out there, as I might have been fooled by the promise of the title into actually purchasing the book. Also won't be buying {Product #2}, which sounded similarly promising, as I assume it is full of the same idiotic tripe that you put in the sample .pdf.  Do better, or die trying.    I'm not huge fan of Wizards (for instance, their editing blow chunks), but you guys don't even come close.  Sincerely, someone who has been playing RPGs since before you were born and actually understands what you should be attempting to do. Good luck wallowing in Wizards' wake.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    Uh, ok crankmeister.  Bet you wouldn't have the guts to say that to my face, Big Man.  Glad I could provide a convenient target for your ill-written, poorly socialized, power-fantasy-inspired spoo.  I hope you feel better, having really put me in my place for something we offered  free on the internet .  Why, you're a virtual freakin' hero.

      Pigeons  Two injured pigeons have taken up residence at Kate's school after being attacked by a hawk.  To the children's dismay, one succumbed to its wounds overnight.  Kate is annoyingly concerned about the second injured bird and has been appointed by the other girls in the class to "take care of it."  She called me from school today to try to convince me to come to the school to help her capture the bird, put it in a box the kids had "prepared" for it, and keep it here at the house where we could "nurse it back to health."    I barely managed to convince her to come home on the bus as scheduled, and she brought with her a cardboard box with holes punched in, and filled with "food" (some student's chewy granola bar) and a "bed" (Andrea's donated sweater) and some origami cranes someone folded to keep the bird's spirits up.  Kate could not stop talking about how she "had to" help the pigeon, how she and the girls have "become really attached to the pigeon" and how "the whole school is counting on her" to keep the pigeon from dying.  Holy cow.  Using my best Animal Planet jargon, I convinced (barely) a skeptical Kate that capturing the wild bird and putting it in a box was only going to stress it and make it struggle, which might make its injuries worse.  We agreed that she could bring some bird seed from our bird feeder stash with her to school tomorrow, so the pigeon will not "starve."  This reminds me of my own crusade to "help" an injured bird when I was all of 6 or 7, in first grade.  For some reason, I was walking alone to school. We lived in a small town and times were different then, but I still wonder what I was doing out there with no supervision.  Had anyone been with me, this story never would have happened.  I remember that I had a brand new embroidered cloth purse that I was very proud of and I was taking it to school to show and share. Walking along the sidewalk on the main street, past Zups grocery (in their old location, before they tore down my childhood home for their modern market), I was only a block from home when I saw an injured robin on the sidewalk.  I suppose it flew into one of the giant store windows and it was crouching, stunned but not dead, on the empty sidewalk. It did not fly away as I approached, did not struggle as I reached down and petted it.  Certain I was "helping" the poor thing, I scooped it up and put it in my purse, which was just the right size to fit a smallish robin.  I'm sure the poor thing died of fright or suffocation, but I just went on my merry way: a wee thing, with a brand new, fancy, embroidered purse stuffed full of dying robin.  I carried it right into class and sat down with it in my bag.  I opened the bag and petted its feathers, cooed and talked to it to make it "feel better" until one of my classmates told the teacher I had a dead bird in my bag.  Horrified, I insisted that the bird was NOT dead.  He was just sleeping.  He was hurt and I was helping him!  My teacher, completely grossed out, asked me with disgust why I would do such a thing?  What in the world possessed me to pick up a dead bird and put it in my purse?  As much as I insisted that the bird was  alive  when I picked him up (and that he was just  sleeping  now), there was no shaking the conviction of my teacher and my classmates that this bird was dead, dead, dead.  Worse than that, if he had been alive when I picked him up (which they all doubted), then I had actually  killed  the bird!  I was a BIRD KILLER!  I wept bitterly as I was sent outside to unceremoniously dump the "sleeping" bird out of my purse, next to the chain link fence that surrounded the playground.  I willed it to awaken, I begged it to get up and fly or hop or waddle away.  No dice.  The bird was dead and he wasn't going anywhere.  Not only that, my pretty purse was tainted, no longer something to show off during show and tell, but a filthy object that had held a dead bird mere minutes earlier. My classmates couldn't have been more put off.  All was in ruins.   Over dinner tonight Kate learned a new word: moratorium.  Chris declared a moratorium on discussion of pigeons.  Turning the tables a few minutes later, Kate declared a moratorium on discussion of e-mail.  Serves us right, I suppose.  All I can say is Kate comes by her impulses naturally, from her caring and sensitive nature, to her desire to "help," to her burgeoning sarcasm and straight-forwardness.

      Tough Day     The ghost of a steam train - echoes down my track It's at the moment bound for nowhere - Just going round and round Playground kids and creaking swings - Lost laughter in the breeze I could go on for hours and I probably will - But I'd sooner put some joy back In this town called malice.              -The Jam, A Town Called Malice    Hoo boy, today is weighing on me, squashing down on me like a real monster.  I was going to write about all the various things that are going on, but I've been finding it impossible to write specifically enough to vent my frustrations and yet obtusely enough to protect the privacy of the other people involved.  Meanwhile, I'm sending a plea out to any of my friends who might be in a position to help me out by keeping Kate during non-school hours while I'm out of town next week. I have a short-notice trip that's taking me out of town from early Monday morning to Sunday evening, and without M. to back me up, I'm scrambling.  Kate is staying with a friend for a couple of nights, but they can't manage the whole time themselves.  I've put my "It's the 80s!" iTunes mix. (Violent Femmes, Suicidal Tendencies, The Jam, The Cure, R.E.M., Soft Cell, The Proclaimers, Big Star, Prince, Rush, Sonic Youth, Devo, Throwing Muses, The Jesus & Mary Chain and so on.)  It's that kind of a day.

      Sadness  M., whose DUI-troubles I wrote about a few months ago, has fucked up again and is going before the courts one more time.  She was ashamed to admit it to me, so I don't know details, but she was apparently caught driving without a license (her license having been suspended as punishment for the DUI offense) and ticketed, while still on probation for her last offense.  I'm torn between being angry with her for screwing up like this, and worried for what the future holds for her.  There's nothing I can do about it, I know I can't fix anything for her, but that doesn't stop me from worrying about her well-being.  I can only assume jail time will be involved.  Am keeping this from Kate, as she would be distressed to know M. was in such trouble.

      Hate in America   urlLink Margaret Cho's website  has published several of the hate-mail letters she received after  urlLink Freepers  got a look at portions of a transcript of her comedy bit at the  urlLink MoveOn.org's  political advertising contest  urlLink "Bush in 30 Seconds"  awards show.  I just don't personally know people who have this kind of hate.  It's so foreign to me, I feel almost bludgeoned by it when I happen across it.  What is it about George W. Bush that inspires these people, makes them feel that he's one of them and on their side, and has them chanting "Four more years!!" in anticipation of his re-election?  Is it just that the Republican party is the "non-Democrats" party (white, rich, Christian, male?) or do they see something else, some tacit approval of their hatred of women, gays, non-whites, immigrants, and Jews?

      Birthday  Friday was our dear friend Kathryn's thirtieth birthday.  Today was her surprise party, and boy was she surprised.  Kathryn's mom, and her boyfriend Jess, planned this elaborate surprise party, complete with catered dinner, a bar with plenty of beer, wine, and cosmopolitans, and a sound-system.  There was even a performance by Trois (Kathryn's mother and mates, complete with beehive wigs, singing).  Kathryn was completely taken by surprise, and it was especially rewarding after her actual birthday had passed "unnoticed" by friends (a fact that had her bumming quite a bit, apparently).  She was flabbergasted that we were throwing the party for her in the first place, and reduced to tears when she realized that some friends had flown in from the eastern time zone for the event.  My own sweet Katherine was there, Kathryn being one of her most adored adult friends, and Kate had a delicious time and received many compliments for being both a polite, grown-up girl and for being a complete ham.  She entertained a group of the adults for quite some time by trying on the singers' wigs and gowns.  Apparently many photos of her were taken...I hope they make their way back to me!  We found out that mutual friends Nate and Ericka are expecting a baby (due in August).  So many babies these last couple of years!!  Very happy for them; they both seemed in a good, centered, calm place about it.  Well I remember the days of my own pregnancy...  Anyway, the night was about Kathryn, and she seemed to have a good one.  I believe that my thirtieth birthday was spent in much less a loved and glorious fashion.  Kathryn has become a dear friend to us all in just the few years we've known her, and I hope that we can continue to know her for years to come.  She and Jess are one of those rare couples with whom Chris and I both feel totally comfortable, and I've come to realize that's a precious, rare thing where couples are concerned.  All too often, there's one side of a couple that is more dear to you than the other, but in the case of Jess and Kathryn, they're both exceptionally dear to us.  It was an honor to be invited to such an event.  I'm so glad we were able to be there.

      Rebirth of Gaming  Every year our game group falls into meeting irregularly around the holidays and during convention season.  Fall and spring are definitely our strong times, where we meet weekly and rarely have people missing a session.  As is tradition, we've started the new year with a new campaign and some new additions to our group.  Last night  urlLink Bruce  and  urlLink Tim  joined us to make up characters.  As a break from fantasy D20 (thanks in no small part to our recent obsession with KOTOR) Chris is going to GM a Knights of the Old Republic-era Star Wars game.  I made dinner as usual (lemon-marinated chicken breasts that could have used a stronger marinade, edamame salad, a romaine and assorted veggies salad, and some angel hair pasta tossed with red pepper and olive oil for those eating carbs), and Bruce gifted us with some of his home-roasted coffee (after a whiff of the beans this morning, I didn't even want to stop to grind them...delicious stuff).  He threatens to bring wine next time.  Tim may be dragged along to more adventurous eating than he's used to, though Rick will keep him company on the "I don't like green things" side of the table most evenings.  Heh.  Anyway, so far we've got a bunch of great concepts: a Wookie Jedi, a Jedi who killed his master (perhaps by accident, or was it?) in a lightsaber training duel, a former Jedi turned crime boss, a hedonist Jedi with philosophical differences with some of the mainstream Jedi teachings, and an Echani soldier/duelist.  Rick is in Japan next week, but the rest of us are going to give it a spin while he's gone. There's still room at the table for Kathryn and Evan (when life with Zoey calms down to a dull roar). I think this is the best group we've put together in a long time, and I'm really looking forward to it.

      Kate is pissed off  Poor Kate.  She has a male teacher for half the week (M-W a.m.) and a female teacher the other half of the week (W p.m.-F).  As far as I can tell, she gets a long fine with the male teacher (who has a daughter himself) and is constantly clashing with the female teacher.  In fact, I can't blame her...I've had the same gut reaction to both teachers.  Not that her female teacher is a bad person or mean or uncaring or anything, it's just our approaches to life and our personalities are sooooo different!  Spending just a few hours in a classroom during the kids' potluck had me on edge, precisely because of the female teacher's style, as well as the attitude of one of the other kids (who Kate had complained to me about before and who I instantly agreed was just as annoying and out of control as Kate told me once I met her).  So, something flared up in class yesterday and Kate and her female teacher had a little confrontation.  Keeping in mind that Kate got up on the wrong side of the bed yesterday morning, I'm not surprised at all that she was having a bad day at school.  Something about silent reading time being over before Kate could read her book or some similar issue had Kate complaining to the teacher, who was mouthing sympathy ("I know you're upset about the book...") and Kate struggling to put her more general angst over life into words the teacher would understand ("It's not about the book.  It's about everything, it's about the whole year I'm having...").  According to Kate, the teacher just kept focusing on the book, and Kate finally said, "I'm just pissed off."  Poor kid, little did she know this was going to be an affront to the delicate hippie sensibilities of her teacher. Kate was told by the shocked and offended teacher not to use that word at school and then sent out into the hallway to "calm down" and told they'd talk about it later.  Then, instead of coming out to talk to Kate herself, the teacher sent the room parent out to talk to Kate, and to pass on the message that she could come back in the room when she had a smile on her face.  I definitely feel for my child in this situation.  It's exactly the kind of ridiculous situation I used to find myself in when I was in school: I loved school for the learning, I hated it for the social interactions.  I moved a lot and so I was always the new kid and was always forced to make new friends.  I was smart, but I was also opinionated and emotional (kinda like, well, the adult me in kid form, who'dda thunk?) and some stupid teacher would get up in my face about not singing during music class or not wanting to be part of the holiday pagent or something and I'd stupidly claim I had a right to free speech or a right not to have to sing bloody Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, and get smacked down for "insubordination" or some other crap.  Kate was not trying to be offensive to her teacher.  Believe me, she knows plenty of Mommy's other "bad words" if she was trying to get to the teacher or cause a scene.  I've just never forbidden her from saying that she's "pissed off" if that's how she feels. Hell, my own website points out that I'm the nicest person you never want to piss off (thanks to Evan for coining that phrase)!  I *have* told her she's over-reacting, that she needs to calm down about something or have an attitude adjustment before I'm going to talk to her about something, but I have NEVER told her that she has to "have a smile on her face" before she can participate. That concept just offends me.  "Smile or you're in trouble."  Blech.  I advised Kate to apologize to her teacher today. I suggested that she can tell her teacher that we don't consider that a bad word in our house, but we also respect others' feelings and she won't say she's pissed off at school. Unfortunately, she's going to have to suck it up and get along with this teacher if she's going to get through second grade and stupid confrontations like this aren't going to make that any easier.

      Happy Birthday Zoey!  My dear friends' baby girl was born yesterday.  At 8 pounds 14 ounces, she's bigger than Kate was when she was born (by 4 ounces for those keeping score), and considering that Rona is about a foot shorter I am, she has my utmost admiration.  I'm thinking that newborn-size baby outfit we bought them is going to be too small in about, oh, 3 days...  Happy birthday, Zoey!  Congratulations, Evan and Rona!

      Space Generation  Born in 1969 as I was, I matured under the belief that space was man's domain and we could and would traverse it as we wished, exploring, investigating, building, taming, domesticating.  The 70s were all about space!  The psychedelic hippies decorated with shooting stars and spinning planets, the television was showing endless reruns of Star Trek, George Lucas owned the hearts and minds of the movie-going public with Star Wars.  We were going to have space stations and lunar outposts and manned missions to Mars.  The UNIVERSE was our oyster.  It took a while for the general public to catch on to what the folks at NASA could clearly see: there was no money for such wild, speculative exploration.  Our government was obsessed with the fight against Communism, ugly wars and government scandals brought the high-flying space age literally down to Earth.  Still, the occasional project managed to survive, and the citizens could point to efforts like the Space Shuttle program and convince themselves that we were still on our way.  I once had an argument with a college mathematician, one of those smarty-pants boys who was studying "higher math" and was sure there was no mystery in the world that couldn't be solved with the right scientific formula.  With what he'd learned as an undergraduate math major, he was convinced there would be no travel to the planets and certainly no travel outside of our solar system because it's "impossible" to break the speed of light.  I, romantic and idealistic and mathematically challenged, took great offense at such nihilism, but the only rebuttal I could come up with was, "But what if they're wrong?  What if what we think we know that makes space travel 'impossible' is wrong?"  I guess I still haven't entirely lost that naïve, uninformed optimism, but I'm definitely more cynical and hold far less doe-eyed confidence in the future for man in space.  When I heard that the  urlLink Mars rover  had successfully landed on Mars, that we were  urlLink receiving pictures  of the Martian landscape, I felt a cautious joy and an appreciation for all the hard work and all the lucky miracles that must have taken place for everything to happen correctly.  Driving our remote controlled buggies around the surface of a distant planet is a delicate process with no assurances; just ask the poor team who worked on  urlLink Beagle .  There's just so much wrong here on Earth, I find it hard to muster up the enthusiasm for space missions that I once had.  When I heard that George W. Bush latched onto the Mars missions, and was going to  urlLink propose  manned Mars missions, my heart sank.  Instead of feeling full of optimism and excitement about such a project, I ask the President, "With what money??"  The  urlLink economy , in case he and his millionaire friends haven't been paying attention, has been the shits for a couple of years now.  We have no more budget surplus to play with, we have a  urlLink huge debt that's getting huger by the day !  We have the never-ending War on Terrorism to fund, an aging population to care for, insurance and health care and education to juggle...where is the money for this grand long-term project going to come from?  Are we going to end up like the Soviet Union, and Russia alone after them, with poorly equipped men and women aboard half-finished space stations and living in colonies held together with duct tape because we ran out of money?  Are we going to have to go begging to whoever takes our place in the world to please go rescue our stranded astronauts?    There's certainly plenty to be said in favor of space exploration.  In fact, I truly believe that the human race's long-term survival is going to depend on sustainable off-world ventures.  But that doesn't change the fact that we can't just keep charging everything to world credit card, to be paid back later by generations unknown.  Unlike George W's other failed businesses, if the United States goes bankrupt, there's no one out there to bail us out.

      Soundtrack  There are certain musical artists whose work is so bound up in my relationship to a person or people that I can’t hear the music without remembering something about them.  Unfortunately, it’s not such a precise thing that distinct, predictable memories can be called up as easily as the tune involved.  Sometimes it’s only a wistful remembrance of a time or relationship now gone.  Other times it’s a visual snapshot, a little mental video clip of a time, a place, a particular event.  Yet other times music can call up only the vague, faded feelings that were once much stronger: love, misery, ennui, unabashed joy, gloom, all just the faintest tinge and almost unrecognizable for what they once were.  I cannot hear The Cure without thinking of Larry, my sweet, high-school, not-quite-punk boyfriend.  Shriekback reminds me of funny, goofy Deej, with whom I shared a long summer of working the night shift and trying to solve  urlLink The Fools Errand  while those around us slept. Kate Bush is forever linked with a man I respected, admired, and earnestly strove to emulate; I hate to hear Kate Bush anymore, because that friendship ended in deep betrayal and is irretrievably broken. Liz Phair sustained me during the miserable summer after my marriage fell apart, and as I grieved, and fucked up, and smashed around trying to figure out what was right.  Oingo Boingo return me to happy days, before I realized that I was harboring an unrequited love.  Funny, strange, happy days.  Soul Coughing will forever be linked with my friend Derek, the particular time we were at a little BBQ and Soul Coughing came on, Derek and I caught each others eye and the moment was perfect: the mood of the party, the mood we were in, the music all clicked, and then someone else objected and Soul Coughing quickly disappeared, and in just a few seconds we’d gone from “Hell yeah!” to “Oh damn.”  The Beastie Boys, of course, remind me of Ray, the Cocteau Twins of John Nephew, and the Indigo Girls of a particular ex-roommate-now-millionaire. When I met my ex-husband, he played in a band that sounded an awful lot like Helmet.  There are some people who are strongly associated with many bands and many songs, of course.  My friend Darrell introduced me to an astounding variety of music, from the Pat Metheny Group to Rush to Prince to Hüsker Dü.  He would go to concerts and write me long, finely detailed letters reviewing each show or new album or new video.  My eclectic musical tastes would be so, so much more narrow and under-exposed if not for Darrell.  A few years back, in the days before personal CD burners were as common as kleenex, I did several cassette tape exchanges with friends in an effort to expand my musical horizons.  I received such a wonderful assortment: Robin Laws turned me on to the Squirrel Nut Zippers, while John Tynes exposed me to Big Ass Truck and The Grifters, Ray contributed The Reverend Horton Heat, and Chris fed me The Rezillos, The Dicks, The Buzzcocks, The Subhumans, and many other bands that don’t start with The (really!).  I find myself itching again for new musical exposures, to craft some new musical associations.

      Ice   urlLink My friend JD , who lives in the same town as my mom and brother, posted some pictures of what the ice storm did to his neighborhood.  Kate, home from school again today, looked over my shoulder at the pictures, and exclaimed, "Did a water pipe break?"  I told her there'd been an ice storm at grandma's house, and here too, then lifted the blinds so she could see the icy wonderland of our back yard.  "Whoa, COOL!" she said and promptly volunteered to play outside.  It's just warm enough that everything is beginning to melt, and the yard isn't too slippery, so I armed her with some left-over one-use cameras from our Disneyland trip, and she's out there snapping away.  I'll be very curious to see what she chooses to photograph and how the pictures turn out.

      For your further entertainment, freezing rain!  Yesterday was full of bad news, with one, lone, bright spot to cheer the day. Now, the bright spot was pretty bright, but overwhelmingly yesterday was full of gloom, with a sprinkling of doom, and a handful of loathsome creatures making loathsome decisions that had me at wits end.  I burned off a bunch of angry energy by rearranging living room furniture and vacuuming.  Kate declared that she likes to watch me vacuum whem I'm angry, and it did result in me feeling much better for a while.  Nonetheless, at bedtime I still found sleep elusive.  I drifted in and out for a couple of hours, repeatedly brought just up to consciousness to hear the vicious freezing rain storm pelting against the windows and sides of the house, and to realize my brain was seranading me with snippets of The Doors  urlLink Alabama Song .  Argh.  Schools are closed in Seattle again today, and from the look of the thick ice covering everything, we're going to be well and truly housebound.  Maybe that means I'll be able to crawl back to bed and get a little actual sleep later this morning.

I had some peppermint tea last night that was NOT decaf and as a result was awake far too late, so I hauled my sorry butt out of bed to get Kate ready for school only to find that I needn't have bothered.  Bummer.  I'll probably walk down to the neighborhood Safeway later today to get a few things, since I haven't walked in the snow in who knows how long.  Definitely wouldn't risk taking the car out today, unless the roads clear.

      The Classics  Recorded Cary Grant's  urlLink Father Goose  to watch with Kate while she was away at her dad's for the holiday.  We left Chris to re-play Knights of the Old Republic on the Dark Side and snuggled down under the covers tonight, away from Seattle's unusual cold snap.  We had such fun with  urlLink Bringing Up Baby , I was really looking forward to another kid-friendly, Cary Grant comedy.  Kate readily agreed.  It was right at her level, and she kept up with the plot and dialog pretty well, except for the few times I had to translate some British phrases (When they say he's pinching their petrol, that means he's stealing their gasoline...). Then, just near the end, where Grant is about to pull himself out of the ocean into the dinghy (filled to near-capsizing with young girls, dangerously close to tipping them all into the water) TiVo stopped recording!  Kate and I yelled out, "Noooooooo!" in unison.  She was good-naturedly upset that she would never what happened.  Cary Grant would have been 100 years old this month.  His entire film career took place before I was even born.  I suspect I have my mother and grandmother to thank for my exposure, such as it was, to "the classics" when I was a child.  Small-town living surely had something to do with it as well.  Without a surplus of movie theaters, cable television channels, or radio stations to choose from, we watched or listened to whatever we had access to at the time.  I watched many an old Rat Pack movie, caught  urlLink I Love Lucy  or  urlLink The Honeymooners  or  urlLink The Lone Ranger  in re-runs, listened to my mother's crazy record collection (including old  urlLink 78s  of Bing Crosby, all those  urlLink story songs  of the 50s and 60s), tuned in scratchy AM radio stations rebroadcasting the old radio serials like  urlLink The Shadow  or the  urlLink Jack Benny Show  and have at least some passing knowledge of the icons of their respective days.    I'm pleased that I've been able to share the best of many generations of media with Kate already, in her short eight years.  Sure, I took her to the theater to see  urlLink Snow Dogs , and she's seen most of the cartoon action movies that make up the formative films of her "generation" so far, but I've also been able to extend her exposure back to my childhood (we've recently watched The Goonies, Escape to Witch Mountain, and TRON together), the music of my mother's generation (Kate knows Elvis, The Beattles, and Johnny Cash well), and now the movies that my grandmother thrilled to and the stars that set her heart aflutter in her day as well.  I also come from a game-playing family, so in addition to the XBox and the Gameboy of her generation, Kate knows well the games we play and produce, as well as the pastimes of yet older generations.  She knows  urlLink King in the Corner ,  urlLink Farkle , and Backgammon (games I played with my grandmother on a regular basis).  She has a deep desire to "help" me with crossword puzzles and word searches, though her inability to spell (the current sign on her door that reads DO NOT DISTRB is just one example) puts those just out of reach for now.  She's at a great age, where she doesn't need my undivided attention every waking minute, but doesn't yet think I'm so dreadfully uncool that I'm not worth associating with. She seems to be enjoying and soaking up these little experiences and I look forward to more, especially while I'm feeling so "hunkered down" against the particularly cold fall and winter we have been having. I'd be very interested in what you, dear readers, would choose to expose Kate to as "classics" were you in my shoes.

      Another Success  Bruce and Tim swung by the house 6-ish last night and we all took off to the U District for some dinner and conversation. Bruce, a native San Franciscan, was suffering mightily in the unusually cold weather, but was sweet enough to agree to relieve me of driving duty (a rare treat for me).  Though it was heinously cold, the roads were clear and didn't seem icy, and we made it to the U District unscathed.  Blue Onion Bistro  (closed when Jim was in town) was open again and ready for business, so busy that we had to make reservations for an hour later and find a way to kill time.  Luckily, neither Tim nor Bruce had been to  urlLink Scarecrow Video  before, so it all worked out in the end.

      More food, more friends  Christine's best friend, David, was in town for a couple of days, so we got together with them for dinner and socializing last night.  After having heard about David for years, it was a pleasure to actually meet him in person.  In honor of his last night in Seattle, we decided to go to  urlLink Nishino  for dinner. To my great embarrassment, I lived in the neighborhood of Nishino for a while right before we bought our house and never paid it any notice.  It's tucked away in what I can only call an upscale strip mall, in one corner of a building that is largely dominated by a heath club and a travel agency.  I've been past it dozens of times, and never even took enough notice to note the name.  Ray and Christine rectified that by making reservations for the five of us, and WOW, what we were missing!  We ordered an appetizer of cool asparagus in a citrusy glaze (I'm pretty sure grapefruit was involved, plus sesame and probably some miso) that was so out of this world that we ended up consuming three orders.  We also had some excellent spicy calamari (one of the few seafoods that Ray can safely eat), and a spicy chicken dish served with several sides of pickled vegetables and intensely buttery shitake mushrooms that were divine.  Then the rest of us who can enjoy seafood branched off into items like baked Dungeness crab in creamy spicy sauce, a foi gras appetizer that melted in your mouth, some creamy white tuna from South America, and Chris and I shared some crisp-fried shrimp heads.  Mmm, mmm.  Wine and sake flowed freely and we had ourselves a good old time.  Returned to Chez Pomminger and loaded up a DVD that David had gotten Christine for her birthday but that she hadn't watched yet,  urlLink Sordid Lives .  Oh my god, we laughed so hard.  It is perhaps not as funny to watch if you're not at least passingly familiar with the "trailer trash" that are being mercilessly skewered in the film, but Christine and I both have relatives who could have been stand-ins.  Ruthless, cruel, accurate in all the little details, a simply hilarious cast of characters with names like Nolita, LaVonda, or Wardell, who refer to each other as "Bubba" or "Sissy" or "Brother Boy" throughout.   urlLink Olivia Newton-John's  opening scene serenade set the tone well, and I know at least a few of my relatives who I could imagine singing it in all seriousness.  Later today we're hoping to try out a new place for dinner.  We tried to go there on our excursion with Jim that  urlLink Chris wrote up  but ended up at Tempero do Brasil when that it was closed for the holidays.  Fingers crossed that it'll be open for us tonight!  Today is the last day of Kate's vacation with her dad, so it's also the last night for us to go out kid-free and live it up as adults.  Kate's a good sport about coming to adult gatherings, but I try not to impose too many adult-only situations on her in a row like we experience during the holidays.  Tomorrow I pick her up and it's back to the grind of school and work.  No more sleeping in past 10:30 or staying up until 4:00 in the morning for me!

      New Year  Chris and I spent the third year in a row celebrating New Year's Eve with Jess and Kathryn at Jess's mother's West Seattle waterfront home.  This year we were the only ones from our group of usual suspects to make it (Evan and Rona being busy having their baby, Pat and Patricia having moved to San Diego, etc) but we got to meet some of Jess's new co-workers from his job at  urlLink ArenaNet .  Great people, very fun to talk to.  The world of computer game geekery is only one small step removed from the world of paper games I'm so familiar with, and my recent obsession with Knights of the Old Republic gave me plenty of ammo when the conversation turned to computer gaming.  J&K have some very nice friends we usually only see at these sorts of get togethers, but in particular it was nice to have a chance to sit down for a couple of hours and catch up with one couple who took their honeymoon before their wedding and went to central Mexico for two weeks in August.  It sounded completely fabulous, and they totally recommended their particular destination it as a culturally interesting, kid friendly, relatively inexpensive excursion.  I was incredibly envious hearing about it.  Unfortunately, I developed a headache around 11:00 and though I stuck it out until 12:45, I was really suffering by the end and had to excuse myself to go home.  I hate being the first to leave a party!  This experince, combined with the headache that came on during Return of the King, has motivated me to start keeping a headache log again to see if I can discern any common triggers. After a couple of good years being relatively headache free, 2003 was a bad year for me.  Starting during the Mutants & Masterminds summit we hosted early last year, where I had a migrane flare-up that washed over me in waves for two or three days, right through to New Year's Eve, I was too-often beset by crippling headaches that seemed to bloom out of nowhere all last year. I'm very motivated to stop this cycle, especially after having had a virtually headache-free period of a couple of years!  I know a woman who has had to resort to  spinal taps  to get some relief from her headaches. I only hope that mine never get that frequent or that bad that I could look at a spinal tap as "relief"!

      Vignette   During my travels by bus yesterday, I was waiting at a crowded bus stop with Kate, when a long-haired, bearded white guy in the park behind us started yelling obscenities and racial slurs at a couple of black guys who were walking past. The white guy was tall, but the two black guys were tall and heavy set.  The white guy had an open can of beverage, I assume he was liquored up.  He certainly acted like it.  The white guy was belligerent, got up off his bench and began to stalk toward the pair of black guys, ranting about being sick of niggers and how he'd kick their asses.  The two victims of this unprovoked outburst at first ignored it, then, after he got up and started moving toward them, started getting more defensive.  One of the other bus passengers waiting with me was an older black man, who wasn't taking any of it, and walked over to the white guy and told him to shut up and sit down.  Whitey, not so drunk that he couldn't see he was outnumbered, sat back down on his bench.  Several passengers watched the exchange uncomfortably and disapprovingly.  Had I been alone, I might have jumped in to break it up myself, I'm prone to that kind of thing.  But I had Kate with me and all I wanted was to keep her out of it, to keep her from even noticing.  Luckily for me, she was wrapping my coat over her head because of the drizzle and didn't seem to notice anything was going on.  When Whitey sat back down on his bench, he made eye contact with me, then gave me a little smile and shrug, as if to say, "What's that guy's problem."  I gave him a little head shake and averted my eyes, to let him know that he did not have my support; I might have white skin but I was not on his side.  He sat quietly, as various bus passengers took quick glances over their shoulders, unnerved and worried about what he might do next.  Shortly after, two buses pulled up and passengers loaded onto them.  I looked out the window of my bus to see that the guy on the bench had gotten up again and was yelling threateningly to the old man, now that he and the other passengers were on the bus and he was safe from confrontation over his behavior.

      "Ankle Deep in Mud"   urlLink Throwing Muses  aren't exactly known for their sensical lyrics, but this line from the song  urlLink Bea  was in my head when I fell asleep last night and when I woke up this morning.  It is truly how I feel at the moment.  I hate politics.  I hate the nasty tactics, the mudslinging, the partially-informed opinions, the insinuations of personal misconduct over the most innocent actions...I hate all of it.  And I'm not just talking about national politics.  I've been foolish enough in the past to believe that I could make a net-positive contribution to local committees, PTAs, conventions, trade associations.  Not because I have a particular agenda, but because I've seen that there was a hole that needed filling, something that needed to be done and no one willing to do it.  I suppose claiming not to have an agenda is not entirely true: there have been occasions where I have volunteered to do something because I looked around at the handful of other possible candidates and sometimes feared that they would make whatever the problem was worse.  I suppose that gives me a default agenda.  I'm a private person.  In the end, I just want to be left alone to live my life in peace.  I'm not out to gain personal glory.  I'm not interested in being the boss of the world.  At the worst of times, I fear that there really is no room for good people in a political environment.  In my various roles, I've tried to conduct myself in a sincere, upfront manner and to work earnestly for compromises that will result in the most people feeling there's been a good end result to whatever the issue at hand may be. I'm not foolish enough to believe that I can please everyone, there are just some people who are never going to be happy if things don't go exactly their way.  JD recently had a link on his site to an interesting,  urlLink sad column about Colin Powell . Powell is the perfect example of someone trying to do good, all the while being undermined, back-bitten, manipulated and betrayed.  I feel for the poor man. If I feel that the "service" I've performed in my various thankless roles has been at great personal cost to myself, my family, and my business, how must he feel?

      I'm a Sap  For all my fearsome reputation as a chick who doesn't suffer fools, someone who doesn't take shit from people, one whose Elbow of Death should be feared, at the core I'm incredibly soft-hearted. No small part of my hard exterior is the result of having my tender heart bruised and trampled over the years by people who would abuse my good nature.  In an interesting example of duality of nature, I've become both harder and softer as years have passed. I certainly choose my battles more carefully, but still refuse to completely give up my fiery nature and or stifle my unwillingness to accept corporate profiteering as a substitute for personal morality. Still, all I really want is to build consensus, make people happy (by providing them with good, fun products; by being a good, straight-up, trustworthy business partner; by choosing to work cooperatively with people instead of being aggressive and unnecessarily adversarial; by being an advocate for people when I have the opportunity) and live in peace.  I am a remorseless sap. I get choked up at the coffee commercial where Jimmy comes home from college for Christmas and wakes the family by making coffee. I think furry animals are adorable.  Since having my own, I am magnetically drawn to babies (something I wouldn't have thought possible when I was a single, childless woman).   Much to my punk rock husband's chagrin (or maybe he secretly loves me for my sapitute) I am by turns both more confrontational and assertive and tender-hearted and sentimental.  A classic example occured today, as Chris wandered into my domain to hear "hippie crap" playing in the background. That hippie crap would be Cat Stevens' song Father and Son, which literally brings tears to my eyes sometimes.      Father and Son   (Father) It's not time to make a change,  Just relax, take it easy.  You're still young, that's your fault,  There's so much you have to know.  Find a girl, settle down,  If you want you can marry.  Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.   I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy,  To be calm when you've found something going on.  But take your time, think a lot,  Why, think of everything you've got.  For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not.    (Son)  How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again.  It's always been the same, same old story.  From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen.  Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.  I know I have to go.    It's not time to make a change,  Just sit down, take it slowly.  You're still young, that's your fault,  There's so much you have to go through.  Find a girl, settle down,  if you want you can marry.  Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.   (away away away, I know I have to Make this decision alone - no)    All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,  It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it.  If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them you know not me.  Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.  I know I have to go.   (stay stay stay, why must you go and Make this decision alone? )     A friend once asked me if, given the choice, I'd rather be miserable or stupid.  The idea being, you can see the world's sins and the ugliness out there and the knowing would make you miserable, or you could choose to be stupid, unseeing, unknowning, aware of only your own smaller concerns, but happily unburdened by greater worries.   I know my own choice.  What would you choose?

      What About Afghanistan?  Over the weekend I caught up on some newspaper reading, and saw Nicholas D Kristoff's editorial piece on Afghanistan in the New York Times.  It's also  urlLink available online  at the International Herald Tribune.  The Boston Globe ran a  urlLink similarly themed editorial .  As a woman, and the mother of a daughter, I have long lamented the treatment of women and girls in these oppressive countries.  Rapes, beatings, imprisonment, genital mutilations, death by stoning, sexual slavery, all based in "tradition" or worse, because supposed religious conviction demands it.  In November of 2001, Mrs. President Bush took to the radio, rejoicing about the military action against Afghanistan with a  urlLink pre-Thanksgiving address  in which she said, "The fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women." In honor of Veteran's Day 2003,  President Bush gave a speech  to the  urlLink Heritage Foundation , in which he pledged, "The United States has made an unbreakable commitment to the success of freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq."    Freedom by what measure?  Freedom for whom?

      Oh, Canada!  Made it to Vancouver and back in one piece.  The border crossing was HELL, as bad as I've ever seen it in the last 10 years.  Cars were backed up solid for more than a mile, inching forward or not moving at all, causing at least an hour delay at the "truck crossing" and undoubtedly much longer at the main border crossing. As Ray said, "I think this answers the question, 'Why don't we do this more often?'"  Both times the boys ended up leaving the car and going to nearby convenience stores for "provisions" so we food and beverage to help pass the time.  We'd had the idea that we'd arrive in Vancouver in the early afternoon, but ended up getting after 3:00.  Then, because of the Valentine's Day rush, I'd had to make our dinner reservations for unusually early, so we had less than an hour to recuperate from the drive before we had to be at the restaurant.  Thankfully, I think the dinner at Tojo's lived up to its build-up.  Ray stuck to the non-fish fare, and Chris, Christine and I all had the chef's arrangement, which meant several courses were just delivered to our table and we didn't have to think about it.  The appetizer was the weakest, and had me worried that we'd made the wrong decision.  It wasn't bad, but I knew from experience there were several other options from the standard menu that would have been better.  Happily, it was all up hill from there, and hit on several of my favorites: "suntan tuna" (tuna rolled in nori, then tempura fried to sear the outer edges while the insides remained cold and red), Tojo's baked oysters (shell-licking good), Canadian sable fish (served hot, with a sweet-salty miso sauce and a side of buttery mushrooms and vegetables), and the sushi platter included Tojo's special Golden Roll (a thin egg-crepe around crab and scallop in creamy sauce).  Oh bliss.  I do love Tojo's.  We spent much of the evening just wandering around the city, seeing sights and chatting.  I took everyone down to Stamps Landing, which has now expanded and remodeled a bit since my day.  Ray noticed that all of the restaurants seemed to have people in outdoor seating or in areas completely closed off from the main bar or restaurant, and we figured out that those were the smoking areas.  A little Googling after the fact  urlLink explains the phenomenon : the City of Vancouver had a year 2000 deadline for indoor public areas to be 100% smoke-free, with the exception of pubs, bars, nightclubs and other adult-only venues, which could restrict their smoking areas to 30% of their space.  There's been some back-tracking on the total indoor smoking ban that was originally in place province-wide, but the bars and restaurants we visited were keeping their smokers separate, and business seemed to be hopping nonetheless.  After raising a pint of Shaftsbury Cream Ale in memory of Nigel at Stamp's Landing, we took a taxi down to the far end of Robson Street and then walked our way back up to Granville.  We stopped off midway down Robson at a place called Maxim's and had a couple of cocktails, and took a detour into a Virgin Megastore to browse the finest collections of geek goods.  Sadly, the US dollar isn't what it used to be, and the prices weren't very favorable, so no purchases were made.  Robson was packed with youths of Korean heritage, waiting on the sidewalk to get into clubs and restaurants.  There were far more Korean-focused businesses than when I lived in the city, to my surprise.  Granville was more of the same, kids standing in the drizzling rain waiting to be allowed into this club or that club. Eventually the rain forced us older folks into a cab and we returned to Broadway, where we had a late dinner and more cocktails at the Cactus Club Cafe (which we'd tried to visit earlier in the evening but had been too packed).  The room we got in our hotel was spacious and comfortable.  It would have had a nice view if we hadn't had clouds and rain to contend with.  Unfortunately, the hotel was packed with college sports teams for the weekend, and when we got up to shower and start our day we found there was no hot water to be had.  Christine got a discount on her room, but the woman at the front desk wasn't going to budge when I also complained.  Ah well, a cold shower it was.  There was just enough time to stroll through Granville Island before our brunch reservation.  We brunched at the  urlLink Shaughnessy Restaurant  at the  urlLink VanDusen Botanical Garden , but rain again kept us from enjoying time outside.  Instead, we decided to head over to the Vancouver Aquarium, which has undergone significant renovations since I lived in Vancouver and is quite a nice collection.  The one complaint I have about the aquarium (aside from the teeming masses of whining children) was that so many of the exhibits had just the name of the creatures and no other educational or informative information.    After what felt like a very long day I was finally able to connect with Kate's dad who brought her to meet us at a little coffee shop I used to frequent and still really enjoy.  Bean Brothers opened the same month that I moved to the neighborhood, and it's been nice to see it grow up from a standard coffee shop, to a dual purpose cafe complete with wood fired pizzas and a deli counter area in the back for soups, sandwiches, desserts, and even beer.  Kerrisdale used to be the province of jewel-encrusted, blue-haired widows walking their snooty little pug-faced dogs.  It's become much younger and hipper since I left BC, and there were many more cool restaurants and shops interspersed with yuppified specialty stores and fast food options.  The 7-11 across from my old apartment used to share space with a carpet and paint store, but now houses a full-on Hobby Shop, complete with a Warhammer 40K sign hanging in the window.  Sadly, the border crossing back into the US was a long and tedious as entry into Canada had been.  I'd probably choose to take the train in the future, and hopefully avoid that mess.  Still, overall, I was happy to be back in the city.  I'd live in Vancouver again in an instant, no question.  Very glad R&C let me show them around a bit.

      Random Update  Car: Still not fixed, no idea when it will be.  Haven't had time or energy to follow up getting it sorted out.  Life much more complicated when taking the bus.  Origins Awards: time-consuming, soul-sucking thankless job.  Luckily for me, Ryan Dancey is determined to torpedo any good work that I may have accomplished in the position, and is unlikely to give up before I do.  After listening to people with grudges old and new endlessly repeating that the Origins Awards are utterly worthless, broken, and meaningless, I find the hopelessness of being able to accomplish anything is very freeing, in that "Welcome to Nihilism" kind of way.  Conventions: Should I know what I want to run at what times on what days for conventions six months away?  According to major convention organizers, yes I should!  Hotel blocks are already filling up, booth fees are due, commitments must be made, and deadlines are looming. It looks like another summer of convention hell is soon to be upon us.  Scrambling to get it all organized.  Daughter: Got a call from Kate's teacher today.  Long discussion about her performance in school.  Will be meeting with a Student Intervention Team because Kate's school behavior and performance are troubling.  My sweet, intelligent girl at home is struggling deeply at school.  Other kids calling her "Ugly Stupid White Girl" doesn't help her emotional fragility.  Came home yesterday with her hood pulled over her head, telling me she wants to hide her blonde hair because "everyone in a five mile radius has black hair."  Who'd have thought it'd be the white kid getting tormented about her skin color?    Weekend: Despite all this, I'm sticking to my plan to go away on the weekend while Kate visits her dad. I'm going to show some friends around my old stomping grounds in Vancouver.  I hope to make a trip to Stamps Landing Pub, which is where our old writer's group (and my partners in Adventures Unlimited) used to meet regularly, before  urlLink Nigel Findley's  death.  Stamps was  urlLink Nigel's  chosen place, and the rest of us gathered around him.  It's where we held our private memorial for him.  This weekend is just a few days shy of the ninth anniversary of his death.  I bawled like a baby the day I heard he died and miss him as much as ever.  It's hard to believe he's been gone so long!

      Why?  Why?  Awake at 2:30 in the morning again.  Why, why?  Bleh.  Got a chance to watch a few TiVo'd movies over the weekend.  I was particularly tickled by the Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn vehicle,  urlLink Desk Set , which I'd never seen before.  There were times I'd swear Spencer Tracy's performance is being delivered through a fifth of bourbon, and the installation of the EMILAC wall-spanning computer system in all its 1950's glory is goofy, retro fun.  More than that, though, the comic timing and chemistry of Tracy and Hepburn, and a subtle, witty script made it genuinely enjoyable.  Next up was  urlLink To Have and Have Not , Lauren Bacall's debut.  Bogart is firmly ensconced in his role as the independent American drawn to do "the right thing" once you get past his prickly self-defenses.  And yet, the film is thick with sexual tension and inuendo, on fire whenever Bacal and Bogart share a scene.  This is the film that gave us the famous line, "You know how to whistle, don't you?  Just put your lips together and blow."  Hoagy Charmicheal as the piano-playing Cricket is a hoot, but man, I don't understand why they made Lauren Bacall sing for this film.  Sultry speaking voice or no, leave the singing to the pros, I say.  Thanks to TiVo, I've also been catching up on Angel through reruns.  The 2003 season episodes have been showing roughly in order, though I also seem to be collecting 1999 and 2000 episodes at a rapid pace.  The more recent episodes are much more engaging than the episodes I caught in the show's first couple of seasons, especially when Charisma Carpenter was given some better material to work with.  Evan always encouraged me to give Angel another shot, but I'm always forgetting when a show is airing, and I'd never quite shaken the impression that it was just a pale shadow of the far-superior Buffy. I'm thinking about devoting some time to watching the Buffy and Angel DVDs and viewing things in proper order.

      Social Miracles  Went to a party at Bruce and Tim's last night.  Got to see another friend from the Bay Area, Ray Greer, and meet his wife (who I'd only seen in pictures) for the first time. Unseelie made it up to the area again as well. Good people, glad they've got reasons to come up this way and visit again. Too bad we don't have occasion to get to DunDraCon these days, that used to be our ony excuse to travel to the Bay Area.  Good fun was had, but most special of all was that Bruce worked his mojo and actually scheduled a social event that both Mike and Lisa Pondsmith and Chris and I were able to attend.  That hasn't happened since Mike and Lisa moved up to Seattle from the Bay Area, lo these several years ago.  Mike and I often joke, as we pass each other on an escalator or bump into each other at the registration desk, that we only ever see each other at conventions and never in Seattle.  I think that may change!    Kate was thrilled to be going to a party at Tim's house, as Tim is a big goof and champion rough-houser: a kid who never grew up.  He did not wince at letting Kate and Cody try to learn to play pool on his pool table (too much for my nerves, I had to leave the room).  Kate and Cody got along famously, and played Prince of Persia together for a good long time, taking turns trying to get past various stages of the game.  They then progressed to 4-person Halo, with a couple of adults rotating in and out of the game.  Chris had been all insomniac again, so by the time we left the party he'd been up for over 20 hours straight.  I was doing a little better, but Kate's passed on some sort of weird roving cold that waxes and wanes on an hourly basis. Friday I was miserable with a tight chest and chills during the day, but by evening felt fine, Saturday morning my chest was completely clear but my sinuses weren't so hot. Strange.  Bruce and Tim have nice friends.

      Kate, the Bird Girl  Kate is fully determined to be the neighborhood animal rescue child.  Yesterday after school she came flying up the steps to the house, beating on the doorbell like there was no tomorrow.  I opened the door and she rushed past me, "I need   a towel   right away."  She proceeded to tell me that there was an injured crow near her bus stop that the local kids were pestering and she HAD to save it, and tore back out of the house, one of my best bath towels in hand.  I got my shoes and coat and went after her.  True to the telling, there was a crowd gathered around an injured crow, trying to coax it into a box.  Another area mother had taken the towel from Kate and lined the box with it, and fearlessly picked it up and plopped it into the box.  By the time I crossed the street, Kate was proudly carrying the box toward me and the other mother said, in thickly accented English, something about packing it with coffee grounds to help it heal.  The crow seemed to be in bad shape, but it was alive and alert and I couldn't stand to see it suffering any more than Kate could.  I called four veterinarians, two bird rescue volunteers, the Washington Department of Wildlife, and Seattle Animal Control before I found someone to take the bird off our hands.  Kate and I ended up driving the bird across Seattle during rush hour to drop it off with Animal Control, who have an agreement with a wildlife rescue organization to collect injured wild animals found in the city.  I told Kate that was the best we could do.  Later in the evening, Kate announced to the game group that if the bird lived she was going to call it Miracle and if the bird died she was going to call it Charcoal.  She also filled us in on how the story of the injured pigeon ended (involving an "Evil Church Lady" who "stole" her pigeon and recycled the box the kids had left for it).  Kate got her whole class involved in delivering a complaint letter to the doorstep of the church, demanding that the Evil Church Lady give "Snowy" back, and added a line (a lie for dramatic effect, Kate admitted) about how she had raised the pigeon from an egg.

      Jetlag sucks!  Oh my god, soooo tired!  I don't know why travel manages to screw me up so badly, but it really does.  I fell asleep before 8:00 last night, and might have had a chance of righting my schedule but then was awoken by some jackass calling Chris's cell phone (wrong number on top of that!) at midnight!  Argh, was awake the rest of the night and had about an hour's nap around 6:00am before having to get Kate up and off to school.  Ran around doing errands all day, only to find out that I'd conpletely forgotten what day it was and that we had a houseguest arriving!    While we were out and about, Chris's cell phone rings and it's Christopher.  "Hi!  When are you getting in?" Chris asks.  "Actually, I'm at your house," says Christopher.  Doh!  And there we were on the other side of Seattle, and with at least one more meeting to have before we can get back to the house.    Christopher was wonderfully understanding, and I think we've got him all set up with a bed and spare key, so all should be well from here on out, but it's been a hell of a day.  Chris is sound asleep (having been up for over 24 hours himself) and I'm dyng to go to bed myself, but must wait until Kate has had dinner and goes to bed before I can give up the day.  At least I did remember to take the trash out this morning...

      We're back  Well, it took a travel day that involved three airports, two planes, two shuttle busses, a rental car, and about 21 hours, but we made it home.  Whew.  Had a great trip, very productive.  Established what I can only consider great new relationships with some really great people, and our hosts made sure we were completely taken care of the entire time, despite several other (unrelated to us) burning fires that cropped up and needed their attention while we were there. We never wanted for anything while we were there, and the days of meetings were punctuated by cordial, rational, productive discourse.    On the first day of our trip we did also manage to see friends M. and M. (different M.s than M. whose DUI exploits I've written about), and peek in on their sweet sleeping baby for a minute.  They had us over to their house and whipped up a delicious dinner, plied us with wine and Bailey's, and I wish we could have drawn the visit out over another day or two because it was so pleasant.  Quite the change from the rampant nest of back-biting vipers and sabateurs to progress I'm all-too-often forced to deal with in certain other of my positions.  This reintroduced the radical thought that perhaps I should just stop agreeing to deal with the game industry boobs, louts, and bullies, and stick to forming partnerships with sane, rational, decent people.  Stunning concept, completely reinforced by the shit storm I returned to find in my inbox when I returned to the world of petty grudges, rumor, and inuendo that far too often makes up the hobby game industry.

      So, the car...  As regulars to Discolor Online have noticed, I'm still without car.  We had a  urlLink little mishap  back in January.  I filed a claim with the city on the advice of the friendly police officers who stopped to check on us. A few weeks passed and I received a postcard from the city claims case worker telling me that someone had been assigned to our case and it would take 4-6 weeks to before we should expect a resolution.  More time passed.  Finally the city sent a letter, but only to tell me that they'd looked into our claim and determined that the area of construction I'd run afoul of was under a permit that had been issued to Seattle Housing Authority, and the condition of the permit was that they agree to hold the city harmless in any incidents like mine.  The claim has now been forwarded to the people at the Housing Authority, but I'm starting the process all over again.  Meanwhile, we're entering ten weeks of not having either our car or our resolution and I've been renting cars a couple of times a month to catch up on the real difficult chores (both for business and for personal) and the rest of the time I'm walking or taking the bus.  Unlike Ray, who had a similar run-in with a pothole and filed a similar claim, we have only minimal insurance on our 10-year-old car, and I can't just have the insurance fix it and get the money back from the city in due time.  Neither do we have the money to absorb a costly repair, should it turn out to be something more major than minor.  In fact, since the accident, both my insurance and car tabs have expired, piling on more costs to getting the car back on the road.  I can't get the tabs renewed until I have an emission test, and I can't get the emission test until I get the engine running.  If the car is not running, I'm loathe to pay the insurance.  Something about paying for insurance for a car that's just sitting idle irks me to the core.  Now, the situation is not all bad.  The good news is that the weather is looking up and most days are nice enough that taking a walk or waiting outside for the bus is no hardship.  I've become much better acquainted with the bus routes around my house, and it's not overly difficult to get where I want to go most of the time. It's frustrating the times when the buses are late or when I roll up in time to see my connection pulling away, or when I spend more time waiting for the bus than actually riding on it (by a factor of three) but mostly the transit is acceptable.  If I didn't have to drive 180 miles round trip twice a weekend when it's Kate's visitation with her dad, I might be convinced to give up the car altogether, or just sign up for  urlLink Flexcar , but I can't get out of those visitation trips, and so I continue to feel tied to my car, despite its current less-than-ideal condition.

      And Spring is gone...  Just like that, the weather went back to being cold, windy, drizzly and gross.  Boo!  Hiss!  My mood, grey as the overcast skies, followed suit and went completely into the garbage.  I ran out to do errands this afternoon but my timing was terrible and I managed to  just  miss three different bus connections, including one that runs only once every 30 minutes.  Utter crap.  Three hours wasted, though I did then have time to pick up some pork ribs from Bob's Quality Meats while I waited for my connections.  Dinner, at least, was satisfying.  I even managed to apply enough pressure to Kate that she cleaned her plate for once (though not before drowning her peas in ketchup and gagging on the single sauteed mushroom I asked her to try).  After I finally strong-armed Kate into eating two small pieces of rib (slowly oven roasted for over 90 minutes, rubbed with salt, pepper, sage and rosemary, a terrible thing to ask of her to be sure) she admitted that it wasn't too bad.  I asked her if she liked the ribs enough that she'd eat them again.  Her answer:   "Weeeelll, on a scale of one to ten, I'd give it about a five.  A ten would be the greatest thing ever, and you've got to admit this isn't the greatest thing ever.  A one would really suck, and this doesn't really suck...too much."   Wow, I'm glad it doesn't suck...too much.  Sheesh.  I'm trying Safeway's online shopping and delivery for Thursday.  I really, really, really miss the days of Homegrocer.com and the outstanding quality, convenience, and good old fashioned fun of being one of their customers.  I haven't tried another grocery service since  urlLink Webvan  bit the big one, but Safeway is offering deliveries in my area now.  Safeway can't hold a candle to Homegrocer as far as selection, but they will deliver 12-packs of  urlLink Diet Coke with Lime .  It's a start.

      Spring!  Ah, what a beautiful day today.  Over 70 degrees, flowers in bloom, blue skies, gentle breezes.  Perfect.  Took the bus to Renton to visit the post office and renew our PO Box.  Ran into Stan! who kindly gave us a ride back to our place and hung out with us for a while.  After Stan! left, the weather was still so lovely, I went out into the back yard and started to putter around.  I managed to take care of a gigantic load of garbage from the back porch (boxes that needed recycling, used packing peanuts and other general crap that I've been waiting to recycle) and then weeded and prepared my little garden plot and containers for planting.  Must remember to get some drip irrigation stuff before we start on convention season this year...  Worked until darkness threatened to fall, and then came inside and watched a couple of old episodes of Angel on TiVo.  Finally got around to making the following recipe for dinner.  It was delicious and dead easy, so I share it here:    Asian Noodles with Asparagus and Shrimp  From  urlLink Cooking Light   6 ounces uncooked soba (buckwheat noodles) 2/3 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth 2 tablespoons rice vinegar 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce 1 tablespoon peanut butter 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon bottled minced fresh ginger 1/2 teaspoon dark sesame oil 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 teaspoon bottled minced garlic 2 cups (2-inch) diagonally cut asparagus 1 pound peeled and deveined large shrimp 1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions   Cook noodles according to package directions, omitting salt and fat.  While the noodles cook, combine chicken broth and next 6 ingredients (broth through sesame oil), stirring well.  Heat vegetable oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; sauté 45 seconds. Add asparagus; sauté 2 minutes. Add shrimp; sauté 2 minutes or until shrimp are done. Add broth mixture and onions to pan; cook over medium heat until hot. Add noodles, tossing gently to coat.  Yield: 4 servings (serving size: 1 1/2 cups)   NUTRITION PER SERVING  CALORIES 357 (21% from fat); FAT 8.4g (sat  1.5g,  mono 2.4g, poly 3.7g); PROTEIN 32.7g; CARB 40.3g; FIBER 2g; CHOL 172mg; IRON 4.7mg; SODIUM 868mg; CALC 91mg;       I'm so looking forward to the reappearance of the Columbia City Farmer's Market later this spring, not to mention the modest bounty of our own backyard garden.  Ah, these are the days when I really love living in the Pacific Northwest...

      Tripping the Rift  A few years ago when the short animation  urlLink Tripping the Rift  was circulating the internet, I was incredibly smitten.  I loved Captain Chode, Six, and Darph Bobo.  I loved it so much that I was willing to download and save the entire several-meg file to my limited hard-drive, through my dial-up connection.  Last year at San Diego ComicCon, SciFi Channel was there pushing their upcoming series based on the short.  I wrote about how Hal handed me one of the free character bottle-toppers that were being handed out, without knowing what it was or that I was a fan.   I've TiVo'd several episodes of the new series now.  Aside from the additional characters created for the series, which are simply not as fun or interesting as the originals, I'm sad to say that the skits just aren't holding up.  What was funny as a five minute short is terribly un-funny as a weekly series.  It fails, but not for the reasons I expected.  I feared that the sexual humor, the cursing, the adult nature of the the show could not be shown on television.  I was completely wrong about that: if anything they're even more foul-mouthed and perverted. Nope, it's simply predictably un-funny.  Bummer.  It's not like a precious childhood memory has been pissed on or anything, but there is a urine stench about the show nonetheless.  I think I'll switch to watching  urlLink Deadwood  instead.

      I'm sick of re-capping  GTS finished up on Thursday, and despite trying very hard to get out to a punk club with friends after the show, I only managed to hang around the bar area talking (or rather croaking and whispering) for about three hours before I decided to call it a night.    Thursday is usually game night at our place, but this week we called it because I just wasn't up to having folks over to the house.    Now I'm finally feeling better, physically, but even so I can't get away from the sickening political environment.   urlLink Joshua Marshall  sums up my thoughts on this week's national bombshell:     The first possibility is that the Bush White House is so freewheeling, inattentive and just plain unlucky that it keeps appointing senior counterterrorism aides who actually turn out to be both policy incompetents and closet Democratic partisans. The second that these malefactors leave the White House, they show their true colors and start leveling all manner of baseless charges against the president.   The second possibility is that every counterterrorism expert the White House hires who isn’t (a) a hidebound ideologue or (b) a dyed-in-the-wool Bush loyalist eventually becomes so disgusted with the mix of incompetence and mendacity that is the White House’s counterterrorism policy that he eventually quits and then immediately sets about trying to drive the president from office.   Which seems more likely to you? Choice one or choice two?     I'm not even going to go into politics at the micro "game industry" level, but suffice to say I'm sick of that as well.  The two arenas are much more similar than I like to contemplate.

       Wednesday, Last   Wednesday at GTS it was clear that my voice was not going to be back anytime soon.  I awoke and had breakfast with the gang.  We were joined by  urlLink Jeff Tidball , who told us about the project he's working on for the swell folks over at Fantasy Flight Games, about his screen writing efforts, and about life in LA, amongst other things.  Jeff's appearance at GTS was an unexpected delight.  I've now gotten to visit with him twice in four months, which is something of a record.  I ran off from breakfast to stock up on throat lozenges and tea, and from there to the Academy seminar I was scheduled to host.  I'd originally asked for an earlier timeslot so as not to conflict with exhibit hours and seminars, but had to acccept a less ideal timeslot when the final schedule was set.  Regardless, we had about a dozen interested people attend and they all kindly clustered around while I whispered and croaked at them during an intimate chat session.  Believe it or not, this is one of the best-attended face to face Academy meetings I've attended.  I was very pleased with the turnout and the particiapation.  I was also pleased to correct a misconception amongst some of the attendees that I was paid or compensated in any way for acting as Chairman of the Academy!  Holy cow, nothing could be further from the truth!  GAMA has a couple of fulltime staff people whose time is largely spent organizing the two shows under GAMA's control and controlling the finances, but the Board of Directors and the Academy Chairman are purely volunteers.  I spent a little more time in my booth on Wednesday.  Wednesday night I had a Board of Directors dinner with the fine people from Nawlins, our show decorator.  Jim McGee and his lovely wife Janet are warm, hospitible people who embody southern charm in the most admirable way.  It is always a pleasure to see them and this year I particularly enjoyed myself as I was seated next to Janet and got to talk to her about a variety of topics, including the  urlLink National D-Day Museum  in New Orleans.  We had to run off immediately from the dinner to a scheduled tour and reception at The Riviera, the hotel and convention center where GTS will be held starting in 2005.  I did not tour the hotel rooms, which I understand are being rennovated anyway, but I did tour the convention facility and found it to be a wonderful improvement over the Orleans arena.  In fact, it's a better facility than the Orleans conference rooms, wedged as they are between the bowling alley and necessitating a long walk through the casino floor.  The Riviera convention area is apart from the casino and one never needs to walk through the casino to get there.  I also appreciated that the seminar rooms are adjacent to the exhibit space, and that sky-box meeting rooms are available.   We were originally scheduled to attend a show at the comedy club at the Riviera but both Chris and I were too wiped out to contemplate staying out any later, so we wandered the hotel looking for the cab stand (which we eventually discovered is underground at the Riviera) and made our way back to the Orleans.  Once again, I went on a mad search for tea to try and coax my voice back, and then went to bed.    Wednesday, This  My voice is back, thankfully.  My coughing seems to be confined to mornings and when I exert myself, but mostly I'm just terribly head-achy and run down now.  Had a somewhat more productive day, but I am fatigued and without appetite.  Must remember not to take Aleve Cold medicine.  Leaves me feeling dopey and jittery at the same time, and it lasts for 12 hours.  Must also remember not to buy Progresso tomato soup when I'm longing for comfort food, blech.

       Tuesday, Last   I woke up on Tuesday to discover that my voice was totally gone.  I could barely croak, and despite the application of lozenges and hot tea throughout the day, I was resigned to whispering, croaking, rasping and generally sounding pitiful.    Tuesday was the start of the trade show proper for us, as we co-hosted a brunch for the retail buyers first thing in the morning. Hal spent the morning doing last minute touch-ups to the Power Point presentation, Chris hauled hundreds of books to the room for the attendees, and I lurked around and begged some tea and honey from some of the very nice servers who were setting up the breakfast buffet.  The brunch went well, and Chris heard several times over the rest of the week that several retailers thought his presentation was one of the best they'd seen over the week overall, which was certainly nice to hear.  Between being sick and having a few residual GAMA-related things to attend to, the day flew by.  I think this was the day I had lunch with Ann Dupuis and Nancy Berman which was quite interesting, but I'm thinking that might have been on Monday now that I've written it down.  Tuesday was the day I made something like nine trips back and forth between the hotel and the arena.  Youch.  The high-point of the day was being able to get together with good friends at the Bellagio buffet.  The wait in the line was long, but we quite enjoyed it once we made it to the food.   urlLink Hal  was attending a business meeting, so he couldn't join us but my heart didn't break for him too much since he and Chris went to this very buffet without me last year.  urlLink John  was nice enough to agree to go to the buffet again after having gone to this same buffet the night before with the lovely Judith and some other industry friends.  Also joining us on our evening out were  urlLink Jeff , Green Ronin favorite Mastermind Steve Kenson,  urlLink Christopher  (our favorite non-rpg author), and  urlLink Stan! .  Since I had no voice, I had a hard time participating in a lot of the conversations, but my voicelessness did result in a funny incident.  Steve got up to use the restroom and asked us not to let the servers remove his plate since he wasn't done with it.  Moments later a woman swept by and tried to grab up Steve's plate with barely a pause, and I just happened to be the first to react.  Except that my normally, er, dulcet tones, which I tried to bring to bear to say, "No!" came out as a hideous incomprehensible screech (something like a teenage boy crossed with a catfight) startling everyone at the table and scaring the crap out of the poor server.  Ah how we laughed.  After dinner we decided to be good and head back to the hotel for some rest, and I ordered up a couple of pots of tea via room service and hoped hard that my voice would return by morning.    Tuesday, This  Argh, why can't I shake whatever this is?!  I made myself some tea this morning but coughed so hard I accidentally made myself puke.  Not good, not good.  I did a little paperwork and puttered, but was so generally under the weather that I ended up going back to bed for a while in the middle of the day instead of pushing myself. Chris ran off for a while in the afternoon to the post office and some other errands and I slept hard.  Kate and I watched Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  Woohoo.  Nothing like reporting from your sick bed to keep the blogging masses fascinated, eh?

       Monday, Last  Monday was the big day. It was the day to set up our booth in the new exhibit space in the Orleans Arena. Prior to arriving, GAMA had made the announcement that the trade show would be moving to The Riviera hotel in 2005 and certain parties were loudly complaining about he change in venue until they had to make the long, long walk from the area where the seminars and registration were held to the arena floor where the exhibitors were stationed. After making that walk myself several dozen times over four days, I will be the first to say I will not miss it in 2005. Not one bit.  Mostly, Monday held many GAMA-related meetings for me. The meeting had the potential to be brutal, vicious, personal, and divisive. Somehow, though, we managed to have a nice, productive discussion (thanks in no small part to Ann Dupuis, who took charge and guided us into neutral territory), undoing a lot of misunderstandings and personal affronts that had taken place over e-mail in the weeks leading up to the meeting. Behind the scenes, however, there were still many things that needed to be addressed, many difficult meetings and situations that had to be juggled, and by the time we got to the Full Voting Member's discussion meeting at the end of the day, I was already exhausted.  After the meeting, there was a post-meeting meeting, and I did my duty and stayed for the procedings even though Chris, Hal, Jeff, and I had reservations at the fantastic Aqua restaurant in the Bellagio. Happily for me, the post-meeting ended in time for me to walk into dinner shortly after the boys had their first cocktails (and before they'd placed their food orders) so I got to partake of the full seven-course dinner. It was divine. A caviar-creme fraiche-smoked salmon-potato appetizer, in an appropriately noveau cuisine-sized portion started us off with a bang. We then moved into tuna tartare with jalepeno (the weakest of the courses, I think). From there we were served miso-glazed chilean sea bass with mushroom consomme, then a langoustine ravioli (yes, only one) in a beyond compare buttery-tomato-cream sauce that we all ate every bit of, to the point of using bread to soak up every last drop. Mmmm. From there we rocketed into full decadence with the scallop topped with fois gras; only just shy of the wildly good kobe beef with fois gras from a previous year's Nobu outting. It was this course that literally brought tears to Jeff's eyes, and brought out the moans of pleasure from the rest of the table. It was SO good. Finally, we got our "entree" for the night, the so-called surf and turf: a buttery medium-cooked filet mignon topped with lobster claw, over a puree of potato and a savory demi glace spiked with just a smidge of lobster oil. Oh my. By the time dessert came, I wasn't sure I could honestly enjoy the assortment of mini desserts put in front of me, but I did my duty. A tiny rootbeer float, with homemade sasparilla ice cream, and a little chocolate straw to go with it, then a tiny thumbnail-sized chocolate chip cookies (warm!) and creme brulee baked in an asian ceramic spoon, amongst other items. We left that meal very, very happy people.   Monday, This  Finally recovering from whatever creeping crud I managed to contract at GTS, I slept restfully and soundly (with a little NyQuil assistance) and woke feeling incredibly refreshed and free from congestion. At least, until I moved. Seemingly, the only way to preserve that blissful state was to lay perfectly still in bed all day, which I could not justify, and once I got up the coughing, congestion, and all-around aching and misery started to resurface. Undaunted, I decided to take advantage of the beautiful, sunny spring morning by opening all the curtains and blinds, then eventually throwing the windows open and letting the house air out a bit.  My brother called to say that he was coming to Seattle to pick up his wife at the airport (she's returning from a trip to Guatamala with some students from her Christian school) and if we didn't mind he'd be dropping in this afternoon and staying through dinner. I was quite pleased to see him as we hadn't seen him since Christmas. While we waited, Chris and I did some much needed cleaning and reorganizing, getting the many boxes of Green Ronin books that piled up pre-GTS put into order, and another set of shelves assembled to hold some new acquisitions (including Green Ronin's InQuest Magazine Fan Award for Torches and Pitchforks, which won Best Card Game this year). Chad arrived, then offered me the use of his truck to take Kate to some appointments in the afternoon, hoorah! When I returned home I threw supper together: broiled a butterflied chicken (though it was bigger than called for and needed longer to cook than I'd planned) spiced with just a tad of cumin/cinnamon, and cloves mixed with bread crumbs, steamed fresh green beans, and couscous. The chicken received raves, even though it hit the table late and in bits (as some pieces needed longer cooking times). Angie called while Chad was still finishing up his dinner to say she'd landed early and he had to take off to pick her up in a bit of a rush. I offered them a place for the night, but Chad (correctly) predicted that Angie would be excited to get home after being away.  Before I could rest, though, I remembered that a couple of charities I often contribute to were going to be coming by in the morning, so I did a final run through the house looking for Kate's outgrown clothing items, out of season or out of fashion items that have been stuck in closets and cupboards around here forever. Three bags, plus a couple of old small appliances that I could stand to get rid of.  I am SO tired. Here's hoping I wake refreshed again tomorrow!

       Sunday, Last    Last Sunday I awoke early in the morning and got packed and ready to go to Las Vegas. Kate, Chris and I piled into the rental car so I could take Kate up to her dad's for the week. Luckily, it only took us less than three hours to make the exchange, return to Seattle, return the rental car, and catch the shuttle to the airport for our departure. Whew. I arrived in Las Vegas just in time to check into my room and rush off to grab just a bite to eat before the GAMA Board meeting, which I was dreading.  Because of the political situation at the moment, the board meeting was one of the better attended meetings I've been at during my tenure on the board. I was a few minutes late because I decided to have something to eat and drink before arriving, lest I stab someone in the eye with a pencil in a hypoglycemic rage, and arrived just as the meeting was starting. I grabbed the only remaining seat at the table, sadly with my back to the attendees, and got down to business. There were only a couple of unfortunate digressions, but I felt frustrated and sick nonetheless.   After the meeting, there was additional post-meeting meeting that needed to be done, so I ended up joining  urlLink Chris  and  urlLink Hal  at the hotel's Italian restaurant just barely in time to have some dessert and coffee. A couple other minor crises were averted, and my memory of the night ends there.    Sunday, This   This Sunday I spent most of the day in bed. I roused myself only when it was time to return my rental car. I was not feeling at all well, but decided to be virtuous and take the bus back, meaning the total time I was gone to return the car clocked in at almost exactly two hours total for the trip. I then returned to bed, where I did crossword puzzles and caught up on my TiVo. Greatly enjoyed the recent episode of the Sopranos, some old Angel re-runs, and the Tracy/Hepburn classic Adam's Rib.

      Playing Catch-up  Sorry for the unintentional dead air here at Discolor Online.  I was too busy, too stressed in the lead-up to the GAMA Trade Show to have anything interesting to say.  Or rather, I had plenty interesting to say but none of it was appropriate for blog posting.  Once I hit Las Vegas, I was running around like a stress-monkey, handling various crises for GAMA, attending meetings, and so on.  We flew to Vegas on Sunday and by I woke up Tuesday morning having completely lost my voice.  For the next two days I tried as best I could to represent my company, to fulfill my obligations for running seminars or discussions, to meet with people.  I sounded so horrible that total strangers kept coming up and pressing throat lozenges into my hands, or telling me to go have some hot tea.  Still, I didn't feel truly, actually sick until Thursday.    The last day of the show, after going to bed early every other night and avoiding the smoke-filled bars and casinos, I agreed to go out to a punk rock bar with a friend from England.  Except that three hours after we were supposed to have left for the bar we were still hanging around the hotel, and wouldn't you know that I'd used up all my stamina in those three hours!  Eventually I had to just go up to bed, where I woke every hour, tossing and turning and coughing.  I'm not quite as sick as I was when I came down with pneumonia after GenCon 2001, but I'm definitely sliding in that direction.   I'm updating from bed on my laptop, surrounded by tea and tissues.  I can't talk at all, I cough if I breathe too deeply, I can feel that telltale crackle in my upper lungs that tells me things aren't good.  And I'm pissed off... I rented a car to catch up on errands this weekend, fill mail orders and to go grocery shopping.  I'm missing a beautiful, sunny, spring weekend in Seattle.  The flowers I planted last fall are coming up and blooming.  Yet here I am, weak and aching and coughing and miserable. Weak, traitorous body!  I'd kick my own ass for being so weak, if I had the strength to do so.  I'll post some write-ups of the higher points of Vegas in between naps and coughing fits now that I'm home.

      Micky Fricky E-mail  Apparently e-mail to my Green Ronin address has been bouncing most of the day.  Even when all other mail was bouncing, some spam and GPA-list postings were managing to get through.  I'm getting no bounced messages from messages I've sent, but I'm not receiving test-messages I've sent to myself either.  Not like there's any important e-mail going around in the lead-up to the GAMA Trade Show next week or anything!  ARGH.  If anyone is having the problem with bounced mails to Green Ronin, go ahead and CC: my Nikchick address at AOL.

      The Game Industry Raises Nice Kids  Kate spent the better part of the day at Cody Pondsmith's Chuck E. Cheese birthday extravaganza, mingling with Cody's excellent, interesting, well-mannered friends.  We shared a ride back to the city with  urlLink Brannon's  son, Stone, who had also attended the party and who lives on our side of the water.  We've also wrangled an invitation to a potluck next weekend that both boys are scheduled to attend, much to Kate's delight.   In the car, Kate told Stone that she was at the party even though she's grounded (for smuggling her hamster to school last week) and Stone exclaimed that it would be worth it to be "grounded for eternity" for something as cool as smuggling a hamster to school. They exchanged phone numbers in the car, and Kate is at this very moment in the living room, chatting away to Stone about her hamster and Knights of the Old Republic.  What sweet kids we have.  Chris is seeing the Subhumans downtown tonight, but after a day of 10-year-olds, Chuck E. Cheese, silly string, and utter birthday chaos, I'm ok with missing the show in favor of crawling into bed with a book after Kate goes to bed herself.

      Tu-Th  Tuesday I used the rental car to catch up on various errands and then returned it to the Capital Hill rental car location.  Ended up meeting up with Adam and Tai from Osseum, and several of Tai's school chums and having a late lunch, which turned into happy hour, then dinner, then more drinks and eventually a cab ride home.  Hadn't seen Tai in ages, since she's been back at school and it was really nice to get together with them, but man did it waste me for the day!  Today was Kate's Student Intervention Team meeting, so I had to be up and on the bus before I'm normally even awake. It was quite a positive meeting, largely in part to Michelle the reading room/special ed teacher who had wonderful things to say about Kate and seems to really understand how to handle her.  It was Michelle who really stressed Kate's positive points and the fact that Kate is not performing up to her capacity, and strongly advocated for Kate as far as testing for learning disabilities goes.  I was relieved that I didn't have to do it all myself, because my other discussions with the teachers had led me to worry that it was all about Kate's emotional responses to things and not nearly enough about the fact that she can't freakin' READ.  I'm strongly suspecting we're dealing with a Talented and Gifted/ Learning Disability dichotomy here, and I hope something comes of the testing.  At least I have a better understanding now of who is going to help Kate make the break-throughs she needs to make.  Aside from these trips, I have nothing new or fun to report.  My volunteer positions are still causing me tons of stress and I struggle every day against just throwing my hands up and throwing in the towel.  On one hand I wonder why I bother to try, on the other hand I can't bear to let the assholes win all the time.  Can't win for losin', or so I've heard.  Tonight was game night and we actually started at a reasonable hour, though much silliness abounded anyway.  I'm so glad Chris is such a patient GM, as we were really going off on some tangents and cutting up tonight.  Still, it felt good and I'm really glad we had a couple hours to play and joke and laugh and have fun before people had to go home this time.  It helped that I made a crock-pot stew and Jess brought bread (and he and Bruce again brought wine) so dinner was ready with no fuss.  They cleaned the pot, too, so I'll have to definitely mark this recipe a success.  I've finally committed to trying to start a cooking club with my friends, and Bruce and I have agreed to hold the first 'event' this month.  I still haven't heard back from a couple of potential members, but the idea is that we will gather once a month to cook and eat and drink and enjoy each others' company.  We'll pick a cuisine or food or theme, and have each of us agree to bring something (even if it's just bread or wine) in addition to the thing we agree to cook together.  If "the thing" turns out, we've got a great meal; if we try and fail, at least we have the bread and wine and so on to eat while we enjoy the process.  I'm very excited to finally be pulling this together, since I've been talking about doing it for more than a year.  Foodies of Seattle-area, unite!

      Lost and Found  Thursday was Game Night and we actually had a full complement of gamers at the house.  Unfortunately, dinner was a little later than I had planned; I was making pulled pork but it took longer to cook than usual because I had to buy a bone-in roast instead of a boneless roast to start from.  Then, when just about ready to serve, I discovered that Kate had eaten ALL of the buns at some point, unbeknownst to me, leaving nothing but the empty bun bag in the bread drawer.  Argh.  Evan took me down to the store for more buns, and I added some chips, potato salad, and angel food cake with fresh strawberries and coolwhip to the list, as long as I was out.  Yummy dinner, very late start to gaming.  Friday morning Kate wakes up and discovers that her hamster is missing. Oh joy.  I hadn't found it by the time Kate got home from school.  First she wanted the neighborhood kids to come in and look for it, then began to roam the house sobbing and looking under furniture with a flashlight when I told her that we didn't have time for that nonsense because I had to get on a bus and across town to the rental car place, and she had to go to her dad's for the weekend.  After quite the ordeal getting the rental car sorted out, I ended up with an upgrade to a Nissan Altima, which the rental guy called "a sweet ride".  Took Kate up to her dad's, then Chris and I went over to hang with Ray and Christine and some of their friends from Chicago.  No sign of small rodent when we returned home.  Saturday I moved some things around in Kate's room until I found her hamster.  He as so dehydrated!  He went immediately to his water bottle and just drank and drank and drank.  In the afternoon we met The Game Mechanics for lunch, to drop off authors copies of books and talk about some upcoming projects.  Straight from there we joined Bruce and Tim for a viewing of the Angel puppet-episode, which TiVo somehow did not record for me.  Laugh out loud funny, oh my god.  I've seen the line "I'm going to tear you a new puppet hole, bitch" popping up in people's sig files.  We moved from Angel into a viewing of  urlLink Red vs. Blue  and from there to frickin' Issaquah (yes, I went to the 'quah) for steak at  urlLink Jak's Grill .  Jak's doesn't take reservations, so when we showed up they told us it would be an hour and forty-five minute wait, which turned into over two hours.  Sadly, Issaquah doesn't have too terribly much to do downtown after six o'clock on a Saturday, but we did go to a local brew pub for appetizers and drinks while we waited.  Happily, Jak's food was excellent once we finally got to eat. Fun night, good company.  Sunday was the day I used the car to catch up on things.  Went to pick Kate up, made a stop at Target and another at Trader Joes.  Picked up things like cases of soda that would be a bitch to walk home with or take on the bus. When I finally got home, I poured myself into bed and watched Teen Titans on the TiVo.  Tried to read a little but fell asleep after two pages.  I'm never going to get through this book!  This morning I discovered that the $40 quality sneakers (not to mention pink and sparkly) I bought for Kate have gone missing.  I was NOT happy.  She went off to school wearing these foul dirty, stinky old slip ons because I can't find her new shoes.  I did find out where all her clothes are, though.  I'd been wondering for a couple of weeks where in the world her clothes had gone, since I washed everything in her hamper and she was still short of pants and shirts.  Well, turns out that after her week of sleep-overs at the end of January, she put her suitcase away in her closet with all of her clothes (washed and neatly folded by Tammy) still inside! I don't know which is lamer, that she did that or that I didn't figure it out for several weeks!  Well, at least she has pants to wear tomorrow.  Now, if we can just find the shoes!

      First you must keep in mind that I had a hell of a day today, right off the bat.  Yesterday was go-go-go from 7:00am to past midnight, and this morning I dove straight back into it.  GAMA stuff, Origins Awards stuff, ex-husband stuff, you name it.  A few minutes ago there was a thump on the front porch.  A  urlLink Cure for Pain  was delivered to me.  Unexpectedly.  Off my Amazon wish list.  For no specified reason.  From a Discolor Online reader.   Thanks, thanks so much, you wonderful person.  I love this CD, and if there was a day when I needed to hear that I'm  not  an awful person who is bringing about the downfall of the game industry and discrediting my organization, it was today.  Cure for Pain indeed.

      Family Dinner  Made dinner for the in-laws last night.  Bill wears hearing aids and most restaurants are too full of background noise for him to enjoy any conversation.  Having dinner at the house was just right, though my chicken took for-freakin'-ever to cook correctly.  I butterflied a chicken and rubbed paste of garlic, lemon rind, salt under the skin, then broiled it on both sides.  At the end I brushed it with some of the drippings and sprinkled with bread crumbs and parmesan and then broiled that until the crust was browned.  Accompanied the chicken with a bulgar wheat salad (bulgar wheat, chick peas, mixed with a bit of pesto, artichoke hearts sauteed with olive oil and garlic, topped with grated parmesan), a green salad, and hot rolls.  For dessert I made a compote of oranges and strawberries in a wine sauce (late harvest riesling and orange juice, cooked with a vanilla bean and orange rind, strained and poured over the fruit).  I think it came off okay, the chicken was pronounced "tender" and the bulgar salad "interesting" and there were few leftovers.  We hung around the table talking until after 11:00pm, whereupon the east coasters realized their body clocks felt it was 2:00am and retired for the evening.  Woke up with a TMJ-induced sore jaw, which tells me I've been clenching my teeth in my sleep.  Stress from the Origins Awards, no doubt.

      Good deeds and do-gooders  My volunteerism is a real drag.  No sense bitching about it too much, but there's this gigantic part of me that only wants to help, to make good things happen, to do something meaningful.  Believe me, I am NOT getting that with what I'm doing at the moment.  Stupid thankless volunteering, is it any wonder nothing gets done when good people burn out over and over again?  At least I got the house in order in time for my in-laws' visit.    At dinner last night with the family, we tried a place that had been recommended to us long ago but that we'd never tried.   urlLink La Medusa  bills itself a Sicilian Soul Food, and despite its very adult-oriented menu they make kids feel very welcome with a ball of pizza dough the kids can shape and then have baked for them (and the usual assortment of cheese pizzas and noodles with butter and cheese on the kids' menu).  While we were having dinner, a young mom came in with her som (about Kate's age) and were seated next to us.  The seating in the restaurant is very close so Kate tried to start talking to the boy, and he signed to her that he was hearing impaired and couldn't hear her or talk with her.  Kate tried some communication by using the note pad on my Palm pilot and the two of them passed notes and drawings back and forth for a while.  His mom also did some translating.  While I did not mean to eavesdrop, I couldn't help but overhear that the woman had never been to the restaurant before but that this was her birthday and she was determined to go out and have a nice time even though she was alone.  She only had $20 to spend, and was sad to find that the entrees were in the $13-$16 range, so was asking the waitress to recommend something off the appetizer menu so she could get a cheese pizza for her son.  Because the kids were playing together, she and I struck up a conversation.  She's in a culinary arts program here in Seattle, as a single mom.  When my marriage broke up, and I was a wreck trying to decide what to do with my life, I looked at that very program.  She had the courage to do what I chickened out of.  I also spent more than one miserable birthday here when I was re-starting my life (I'll never forget the time I invited an acquaintance to a birthday party that I was determined to throw myself to stave off crippling depression only to have him respond that not only would he not come to my party but he really disliked me and disapproved of how I was living my life... ouch.) and decided to do something nice.  I slipped the waitress my credit card and asked her to please put a dessert on my card and deliver it to the table (preferably after we'd left) and while the waitress made it much more difficult than it needed to be, I think it still went off ok.  She almost blew my cover by delivering the reciept to the table while my father-in-law was paying for dinner, and wow, there was almost a scene as he was determined not to let me pay (and I didn't want to explain what I was up to while we were sitting there).  I hope our aspiring chef and her son enjoyed their dessert and had a nice night out.  I must say it was much more rewarding to make that little gesture than any of the other supposedly good things I endeavor to do (and get raked over the coals for) the rest of my life.  Maybe if I wasn't so used to getting beaten up over my attempts to do the right, nice, or decent thing I wouldn't have resorted to buying the dessert in secret and slinking out of the restaurant before I could be caught doing it.

      Operation Ruthless Purge proceeds apace.  This was a Kate-free weekend, so I planned to spend much of my free time on a cleaning rampage.  I've been reading  urlLink Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House  by Cheryl Mendelson.  This book is a Joy of Cooking for modern domesticity, not a "program" for organizing or stain removal but part history, part philosophy, part scientific explanation, all as interesting and well-told as anything by  urlLink M. F. K. Fisher .  So inspired was I after reading the preface, I now have a sparkling, top-to-bottom clean master bathroom, complete with new shelves and new towels (Target had very nice towels on sale this weekend 2 for $8, replacing frayed flat towels from purchased in 1989).  I also scrubbed on hands and knees the high-traffic area of our carpet, the route from the front door to the kitchen.  I purged several jars of old spices and cooking ingredients (some, I'm ashamed to say, decades old), not just tossing everything, but emptying containers, sorting them into the recycling.  The pantry is looking much better, but I still have too much to fit in the newly organized space.  More to be done there.  Installed a new showerhead in the guest bathroom, went to sleep with clean sheets on the bed.  Bliss.  Amid all the cleaning and organizing, I was somehow also able to fit in lunch with Chris and Ray at Columbia Ale House, a viewing of Kill Bill (parts 1 and 2) and dinner with Bruce and Tim, and keep current with The Sopranos (thank you TiVo).

      Chris is starting us on a new RPG game, playing some Lord of the Rings (Decipher's version). The Star Wars game died out from lack of momentum, even though we had a good group, there were too many interruptions leading into the beginning of the campaign where we couldn't get the group together. I hope that switching gears into LotR might give us the kick-start we need.  Either that or we're just going to have to give up and call this "Dinner at Nicole's" night and quit pretending we have a pretense of gaming.   My in-laws are coming for a week-long visit next week, so I have to have things in order in the house for their visit. Lots on my plate with the company, but I seem to have finally shaken the funk I've been feeling leading into and after GTS, which has enabled me to finally get a bunch of things accomplished. Kate and I both have lingering colds, but I think with liberal applications of echinacea and Umcka Cold Care I will be able to stave off a full relapse. I'm also sure that the improved weather and the longer, sunnier days have had a good effect on my mood and motivation.  In two weeks I've got the Community Services for the Blind people coming by to collect donations of household goods, and I'm going to make an effort to purge a bunch of stuff. I've been pretty good at getting rid of old clothes in the previous pick-ups, but this time I'm going to look at cooking gadgets, dishes, bedding, anything that's taking up room in my house that I can clear out. I have a terrible pack-rat tendancy and those who have seen my mother's house think I'm doing pretty darn well, but I'm still feeling uncomfortably cluttered and restricted by the things I've got stowed away these days.  I've moved so often in my life, I have no childhood "home" to look back on. There were years when I went to a different school every year, and lived in a different house, if not in a different city or different state. Even after I got out of high school, I lived in nine different places over two or three years, from Minnesota to Georgia and back again. All of my nostalgia for the past rests in people and things far more than places, and that's made it much harder than it should be not to hold onto things that remind me of good times, hard times, interesting times...time in general. Now that I'm settled for real, in a house of my own, with a family, a yard I can dig up if I want to, walls I can paint or nail or rip down entirely if I want to, I'm thankfully losing some of that unnatural attachment to random "things" that aren't genuinely useful (or at least rememberances of things truly worth remembering) and I'm quite happy about it.

      Time keeps flying by.  The weekend was wonderful, completely beautiful weather that allowed me more time to putter in the yard and get it into shape.  I planted some flowers on the border space near the garage, pulled up weeds and nuisance plants that had sprung up between the plants I put into the front yard in the fall, and put out fresh cedar chips.  I found a few sunny patches to sow wildflower seeds as an experiment, we'll see how that goes.  I bought a book for bus reading, but ended up getting so engrossed in it I finished it after only two days of bus riding!   urlLink Girl with a Pearl Earring  is a lush, vivid word-picture of life in 1665 Holland and wonderfully imagines what life among Vermeer's family and painting might have been like.  Not sure if I care to see a movie of it, but the book was fantastic.  Have started reading  urlLink The Tale of Despereaux  to Kate, and found it to be a charming little story.  Very sweet, and it's completely grabbed her imagination.  Over the weekend we also saw  urlLink Hellboy  and aside from Kate not liking the icky elder gods and their monsters, we all thought it was a fine film. Ray and Tynes both found it lacking, but I was entertained.  Swung by R&C's and hung out with their other guests, used their grill, and watched some MST3K on the home theater.  Easter passed uncelebrated except that I made a pork roast with apricot-rum glaze and artichokes with melted butter, and angel food cake with strawberries. Any excuse to cook, any excuse to have angel food cake and strawberries.  Now, suddenly, it's Wednesday, and I've been back to work, tracking down orders, organizing endless paperwork, juggling, juggling.  Nothing nearly as fun as warm spring days in the sunshine, good books and fresh strawberries, that's for sure.

      Girls' Night Out  Chris was off again tonight for yet another punk rock show (seeing The Business again tonight, with The Suicide Machines on Tuesday, if I overheard the plan correctly).  This must be some sort of personal record for him, for recent years at least.  Since starting Green Ronin, the poor man's socializing has really fallen off, especially with gaming seeming more and more like work.  I'm glad he's been making time for himself and returning to the punk rock.  Meanwhile, Kate and I spent the last day of her spring break doing things together.  While I have a tremendous amount of things on my plate, I just couldn't stand to "waste" her entire school break (since I had multiple meetings all week for which Kate was well-behaved), especially when the weather today was 70 degrees and sunny with a light breeze.  I've spent many an Easter weekend hunting for easter eggs in the snow at my step-grandmother's home in Minnesota, so being out in the yard with the trees and flowers in full bloom was just heavenly.  Kate "helped" me pull weeds from the lawn with a cool little gadget called the  urlLink Weed Hound  that I picked up last week.  Works like a charm, though Kate is too much of a light-weight to stomp down on it effectively just yet. She also assisted with planning out several areas of garden (my vegetable patch, several containers, a couple of areas along the side-yard where I'm trying some sunflowers) and digging around in the soil.  In the end, I transplanted a medium-sized potted thyme plant and planted some marigolds, lavender, pole beans, carrots, beets, radishes, spinach, celery, leeks, yellow crook-neck squash, bush peas, watermelon, cantaloupe, cilantro, parsley, dill, basil, and a couple of pots of mint.  I have some tomato plants and a couple of other seedlings coming from  urlLink Seeds of Change  in May, and many of the seeds I used today also came from them.  I've still got a ton of chives and oregano that made it through the winter in the "salsa pots" I bought late last summer.    The back yard is looking quite nice, and I still have more planting I can do if I can scrounge up another decent area to put in another vegetable bed and somewhere for my wildflowers to grow.  Seems like everything I want to grow is greedy for sunshine, which is in short supply in the rest of the yard.  The apple tree is in full bloom, the other mystery trees along the fenceline seem to have come back a bit from their frightening near-death appearance of last fall, and even my sad, sad little lilac and Kate's raspberry vine seem to be thriving so far.  Must, must get drip irrigation set up on a timer before we go roaming the country attending conventions this summer.  We additionally got the bird feeders cleaned up and filled, so now I have a suet feeder, two seed feeders (one platform, one tube) a thistle feeder, and (a first this year) a hummingbird feeder.  We've also mounted a squirrel feeder on the fence away from the bird feeders, not that the squirrels have been a problem in the past.  You'd think my yard was a lot bigger than it is, for all the stuff I've managed to put back there.  The front yard still needs some sprucing up, and I have two large backs of wood chips to strategicly distribute, perhaps tomorrow.   After Chris left for his show, Kate and I hopped in the rental car (as long as we still have it) and went off to see  urlLink Ella Enchanted , which surprised me by being reasonably enjoyable (at least as far as kid-friendly films go).  It gives several clever nods to other fantasy movies of its ilk ( urlLink Princess Bride  in particular, additionally enjoyable with Cary Elwes in a major role), and with a wacky supporting cast that includes Eric Idle, Parminder Nagra, Joanna Lumley and Minnie Driver).

      Vegetarian Paradise  For the last couple of days, Chris and I have been entertaining a vegetarian friend who is unfamiliar with Seattle's plethora of excellent vegetarian dining options.  One of my favorite restaurants in all of Seattle is  urlLink Cafe Flora , nestled in our old neighborhood of Madrona, so of course I jumped at the chance to bring him there for lunch.  He took my recommendation of the smoked mushroom salad, which is plate-licking good.  I had an asian-inspired soba noodle salad, but apart from the soba noodles themselves I didn't much care for the other components, especially the seaweed.  Some seaweed I enjoy quite a bit, but this particular type was an unnatural green and had a very fishy taste.  Our waiter admitted, as he cleared my plate, that he didn't like this style of seaweed either.  On the other hand, Chris's veggie pte plate was excellent as always, and my dessert of vegan coconut cake with mango sorbet was out of this world.    We also tried the  urlLink Green Cat Cafe  on Capitol Hill, which is a hopping breakfast joint and solid for lunches, but sparse on dinner options (to my chagrin, since we showed up for dinner).  Still, the vegetarian chili was quite good and I'm interested in giving the place a shot for breakfast sometime (in spite of parking being such a trial on Capitol Hill).   Our last vegetarian adventure ended up being a trip to  urlLink Carmelita .  Oooh, I was very pleased.   Carmelita is off in the north of Seattle, which we only rarely ever venture out to, and I'd heard the restaurant was very good but I'd never eaten there.  I had only a vague idea of where it was (near Greenlake) but thanks to  urlLink Vindigo  I had a map and directions and only outsmarted myself once along the way.  Carmelita was fantastic. It was the perfect balance of friendly service, upscale presentation, and yet comfortable atmosphere casual enough to bring well-behaved children.  Our waitress was wonderful, friendly and attentive, explaining things off the menu (What exactly is a  urlLink pave ? What is  urlLink muhamara ?) and making sure we had everything we needed, when we needed it.  My water glass was empty for no more than 10 seconds.  It was amazing.  I started with a glass of the red Italian varietal (name completely forgotten now) that was very good, then moved into the butternut squash soup with roasted pears and candied walnuts.  Rich and creamy!  The boys shared the antipasto platter and raved about it.  When it came time for entrees, Chris has the pizza with portabella mushrooms, brie, roasted fennel and garlic, with pear relish and rosemary honey.  The other adults went for the outrageously luscious truffle-potato pave, with spinach gnocchi, braised kale, tomato confit and lentils.  Chris was jealous when he saw the pave hit the table, but I shared liberally with him.  We ordered a pear crumble with vanilla bean ice cream for the table, throwing the whole thing over the top into decadence as is our custom.  I signed up for their mailing list, and will definitely be back for more yummy vegetarian cuisine.

      Spring Break Madness  Crazy juggling of work and home during this week while Kate is off from school.  Monday was particularly trying, as Chris and I had business to conduct and in the process I also had to juggle meetings with Kate's therapist, running to the bank to find out why my Friday deposit hadn't cleared by Monday, and lots of driving all over town.  Had some moments of high stress and thought I'd hit my breaking point when I realized that I'd forgotten the meeting with the therapist (for which I was going to be charged $120 cash whether or not I attended) and rushed to get there in time to get some utility out of the meeting. Worst was when the therapist told me that Kate's teacher feels Kate is "doing better" even though we've done NOTHING substantially different.  These meetings with the therapist have been almost entirely "getting to know you" meetings so far, no actual "Hey here's how to cope with being bullied or with crying in class when you feel frustrated" advice has been dispensed...but clearly the teacher *thinks* there's been improvement because she knows Kate has been seeing Peggy.  I find the whole thing enraging, but I'm going to continue for the duration of the school year if possible, so Kate might actually get some useful help from this woman and so the school cannot come to me later and say that I didn't do my part.  Irritated just thinking about it.  Last night Kate had her friend Celia over for a sleepover, and I will have the girls all day today.  If the weather is nice, I might break away to go to the park with them or something else that will let them burn off some energy.  Lots of squealing and running around.  The  urlLink Experience Music Project  is another possibility.  The only time I've been there was for a Wizards of the Coast Christmas party (two weeks before a known round of layoffs was scheduled to occur; the mood was rather grim).  Juggling, juggling.

      Totally gorgeous spring day again today!  First thing this morning I got out in the yard to prune some of our bushes and trees, to cut the grass, to bring the weeds under control (especially in the side yard and in the front where I did so much fall planting).  I'll bet I spend at least two good solid hours working on the yards, but it made me feel SO good.  I snipped a bouquet of tulips and hyacinths from the flowers that are currently in bloom.  Today was the first meeting of our fledgling little cooking club.    and   hosted the first get together, and our theme was Italian.  Christine was out of town, Kathryn was getting prepared for a big event for the zoo (her job), so it was just Bruce, me and Nihar as the cooks, and Chris and Tim as interested diners.  Bruce supplied some delicious red wines and made crostini with three different spreads: gorgonzola and almond, chicken liver, and tuna.  They were all divine, though the gorgonzola was my favorite (I'm a sucker for cheese).  Nihar made a spicy sausage and vegetable red sauce and an alfredo sauce.  I made up Christine's recipe for bagna cauda, but I think Chris and I were the only ones really interested in it, though Bruce did have some.  I don't think Tim or Nihar gave it a try, but it was served with vegetables (anti-Tim fodder) and I have a vague memory of Nihar saying seafood is not good for him (and there are anchovies in that).  Bruce picked up a 4 pound boneless leg of lamb, and I brought the recipe for cooking it.  Rubbed in a paste of fresh basil, pancetta, garlic, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, and fresh rosemary, the lamb was baked on a bed of red onions, olives, and olive oil, and basted with balsamic vinegar and red wine.  Yum!  While the lamb baked, Bruce and I conspired on some pasta.  After a little trial and error, we succeeded on putting together some nice fettuccine by using the Cooks Illustrated recipe, Bruce's pasta roller, and my  urlLink chitarro . Everything was delicious, and we had a great, leisurely time.  After stuffing myself, I whipped up a couple batches of sgroppinos (2 parts lemon sorbet, 1 part champagne, 1/2 part vodka, blend and enjoy) which really capped the whole thing off nicely.  Nihar had to go home to tend to his neurotic dog who has been giving him fits since his wife has been out of town on an extended visit to India to see her family.  I suggested he look into hiring a neighborhood kid to be his "pet pal" and to come over and play with the dog, to keep it entertained so it stops being destructive.  The rest of us stayed around to watch a terrible (in all the best ways) movie:  urlLink G.I. Bro .  "If you're a kraut, he'll take you out."  Oh yeah, it was 1977 alright.

      I'll be leaving shortly for another mega-drive down to Portland to pick Kate up from my mom's.  If I miss the worst of the holiday traffic, I'll be on the road for 7 hours or so today.   Bleh.  My route is fairly boring, but at a certain point I must pass the Uncle Sam billboard, where some crackpot farmer has been posting little vitriolic slogans with a decidedly conservative bent for decades now.    The most recent of these visible from the southbound lanes was "Did Jessica Lynch receive kind treatment or an apology?"  That there is a person alive who can equate the treatment of Jessica Lynch to America's treatment of prisoners in this Iraq war just sickens me.  Nothing like having a few hours alone in a car to stew about that.

      Up at 6:30am.  Got Kate off to school, showered and had coffee and e-mail (not in that order).  Bussed off to get my rental car, picked Kate up early from school, picked up her things at the house.  Drove to Oregon in tremendous traffic and periodic freeway-obscuring downpours.  It was crazy weather and frustrating to drive in. Turns out the weather was spawning  urlLink funnel clouds  and other severe and dangerous conditions!  Yikes.  Passed the  urlLink Uncle Sam Billboard , maintained by a crank near Chehalis (which is "balanced" by the equally wacky but more sensitive  urlLink Gospodor Monuments  just a little further down the road).  More on that tomorrow.  Crossed into Oregon and hit bumper-to-bumper traffic at a standstill in all lanes.  Joy.  Eventually cut off through the city and met my mom at work (only an hour late).  More traffic and finally dropped her and Kate off for a weekend camping trip that's become something of a tradition for them.  Stopped back in Canby for a quick dinner with my brother, had pesto chicken breasts at  urlLink Jarboe's .  No great shakes, but far better than fast food on the freeway.  Drove back home, this time with far less traffic (I was actually able to use the rental car's cruise control!) and periodic but not freeway-obscuring rainfall.  Listened to Kid A on the last leg, perfect driving music.  Drove a total of 415 miles today, and I'm beat.

      Just wondering what folks think of Blogger's new comments function.  Like it better than my old  urlLink Haloscan  comments?  Not as much?  I can't decide what I think.  I liked Haloscan's option of showing the commenter's webpage link, but I like the integration of the Blogger comments with the rest of the site.  Of course, this whole thing could change if I decide to make  urlLink pMachine  my main technological squeeze... still playing around with that idea.

      Because there's no hope of me being able to put together anything coherent and it's been a week since I posted anything, some random thoughts that have been bouncing around in my head:  Kate has strep throat and is home from school.  Three hours on the bus and at the pediatrician's today.  She can't go to school until she's been on antibiotics for 24 hours.  Bleh.  My roses are doing really well, the sunflowers seem to be taking root, and both the lilac and the rhodedendron I planted last fall rewarded me with blooms this year.  The carrots, beans, squash, leeks and cherry tomatoes have taken off well in the vegetable garden, and the flowers along the side yard are blooming nicely, but the lavender and the mint I tried to start from seed have shown no sprouts for the second year in a row.   Angel series finale: anti-climactic.  Was a great episode, very enjoyable, but as the series ender I felt a little let-down.  Sopranos: yeah baby, they've really been on a roll lately.  For some reason Chris and I both thought this was the last season, and were pleased to find out that there's another year to look forward to.  I received a complaint from a guy who objected to the Nocturnal's book because of its "gratuitous nudity" and telling me that he had been looking forward to playing it with his kids.  I'm still stunned about that one... pictures of creepy zombies, an undead gunslinger with his mouth stitched shut, Doc Horror probing the brains of an oozing corpse with a bloody tool, tentacled horrors man was not meant to know...all that's ok?  Good wholesome family fun, that is!  There is ONE single picture in the book that shows titty (and that's on a little pixie faerie creature) and a couple of shots of the water-creature member of the team in a bikini top in her human form, and all of a sudden it's whoa, stop the presses, save the children?  For the fourth time in a year, my health insurance company sent me a new set of cards.  The instructions say that I'm supposed to show the "Physician's Visit" card first, to get a "discount on services" but specifically says on it "This is not insurance" and my damn doctor doesn't know what to do with it when I do show it.  Showing it just causes me to be harrassed by the insurance nazis at the hospital before they'll let us check in to see Kate's doctor.  Must get better insurance!  Being self-employed sucks in that regard.  Seattle is having a tent caterpillar invasion, and I was forced to resort to lopping some branches off my apple tree to keep them from spreading all over my yard. I think I caught them in time.  The apple tree looks like it will have a great deal of fruit (for the first time since we bought the house).  Fingers crossed.  Gotta stop watching Deadwood before bed.  I have dreams where GAMA politics get all bound up with drunks, gunslingers, and guys yelling about "fucking hoople-heads."

      In the interest of spending a little time doing something for myself this weekend that didn't revolve around catching up on chores or the Origins Awards, I was inspired to give myself a little project. I pulled down 23 books (largely from the bookshelves next to the bed) and wrote down the opening sentence from each. Once I had the lines, I set about putting them together in an order that could possibly resemble a story. I'm actually pretty amused at how it turned out. The origin of each sentence is a different book and a different author, some more obvious than others. How many do you recognize?     Thundershowers hit just before midnight, drowning out the horn honks and noisemaker blare that usually signaled New Year's on the Strip, bringing 1950 to the West Hollywood Substation in a wave of hot squeals with meatwagon backup. There were prodigies and portents enough, One-Eye says.   The Salinas Valley is in Northern California.  The island of Gont, a single mountain that lifts its peak a mile above the storm-racked Northeast Sea, is a land famous for wizards. From my first breath in this world, all I wanted was a good set of lungs and the air to fill them with – given circumstances, you might presume, for an American baby of the twentieth century.  Maybe it comes from living in San Francisco, city of clammy humors and foghorns that warn and warn–omen, o-o-men, o dolorous omen, o dolors of omens– and not enough sun, but Wittman Ah Sing considered suicide every day.   We slept in what had once been the gymnasium.  At the first gesture of morning, flies began stirring. The night sky brightened faintly in the east with the approach of dawn as the Chosen entered the Gardens of Life.   It was four o'clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began to arrive.  The woman on the horse reined in her weary steed.  She was called Isabelle, and when she was a small girl her hair had changed colour in the time it takes a bird to call to its mate.  From between two trees at the crest of the hill a very old man watched, with a nostalgic longing he thought he'd lost all capacity for, as the last group of picnickers packed up their baskets, mounted their horses, and rode away south–they moved a little hastily for it was six miles back to London, and the red sun was already silhouetting the branches of the trees along the River Brent, two miles to the west.    A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the tree, but the young girl beneath it did not seem to notice.  Lyra and her daemon moved through the darkening hall, taking care to keep to one side, out of sight of the kitchen. The tall man stood at the edge of the porch.   A full moon shone over Sanctuary, revealing boats in its harbor, dwellings within and without its coiled walls. The sand of the desert of Yondo is not as the sand of other deserts; for Yondo lies nearest of all to the world's rim; and strange winds, blowing from a gulf no astronomer may hope to fathom, have sown its ruinous fields with the gray dust of corroding planets , the black ashes of extinguished suns.  The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.  The storm had broken.  The cycle of our Earth (and indeed, our universe, if the truth had been known) was nearing its end and the human race had at last ceased to take itself seriously. It was starting to end, after what seemed most of eternity to me.  It was a bright cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen.

      Chris and I were going to try to hit an art flick on Friday, but ran into Adam in Capitol Hill and ended up missing BOTH showings.  Blew my shot for fun.  Had a fabulous dinner at The Green Papaya, took the bus home and immediately collapsed into bed. Spent the rest of the entire damn weekend working on Academy stuff.  Not Mother's Day brunches for me!    It didn't take me long to realize that this week was going to suck, what with the Origins Awards nominees finally being announced.  I've heard from people about all manner of things, including the "outrageous oversight" of not including dice ("Without DICE there would be NO GAMES!!!"), board game enthusiasts wondering how the nominees are picked, people railing at me that their favorite products didn't make the cut (or that their product that they worked on didn't make the cut) thus making the awards a joke, a sham, an insult...those who are demanding changes to acknowledge" the recent trend in games released and sold in the PDF format."  Oh, its been pure joy, trust me.  Of course, one would think my life revolves around the Origins Awards or something, but that's just my volunteer position, so there's been an abundance of joy involved with my day job as well.  That whole pesky day job thing, where I'm supposed to be earning my living and keeping a roof over my daughter's head, by making and selling good games. ("Good" obviously being the subject of acrimonious debate at the moment, of course.)  I've had the additional joy of having to track down a rather significant payment that I expected to have arrived weeks ago, dealing with licensors (some of whom have been an absolute joy to work with, others who have been nothing short of hostile and obstructionist), listening to well-respected industry pundits spout off about professionalism all while knowing that when they worked for me they were outrageously late on their projects (and the extensions) without so much as an apology.  But really, what I feel the worst about, while all the outraged Origins howling has been going on was my poor, sweet girl.  Kate attended her father's wedding over the weekend, and came home to find her beloved Silky dead in his cage.  At literally the same time that I was reading the dozens of e-mails about the "outrage" of this or that thing getting or not getting public kudos, my baby was sobbing her heart out.   urlLink Pramas  writes about it in good detail at his website.  I suspect Kate, though 8 years old and utterly brokenhearted (she sobbed in her bed until midnight), will have gotten over her confusion, sadness, and grief over Silky long before the adults in the game industry get over their anger, suspicion, jealousy, and partisan bickering that the Origins Awards seem to bring out in them.

      My friend Ruth recently asked about guilty pleasures, specifically in relation to music.  It got me thinking.  Why "guilty" (aside from her Catholic upbringing)?  Not to say that I don't have guilty pleasures, I most certainly do.  I think most people do...but why do we let our pleasures be tainted by guilt?  Or, if guilt is too harsh a word, why do we care what others think about what we enjoy?  You see it in all circles: it's not just in the broader categories of jocks vs. geeks, or metal heads vs. opera lovers.  Gamers mince themselves down into categories, they love D20, they hate D20, they love dwarves, they hate dwarves, they hate people who hate dwarves.  At that point, I think, that's when a pleasure becomes "guilty."  You admit (or don't) that you like ABBA or you enjoy Battlelords of the 23rd Century or you actually look forward to having a Big Mac once in a while.  In that vein, I've examined my guilty pleasures and decided that I'm going to embrace my pleasures  without  guilt.  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to shirk from the fact that I love a good sing-along with Simon and Garfunkel, The Jackson 5 or Jesus Christ Superstar, I prefer a grilled cheese sandwich made with Velveeta over those made with "real" cheese, I would buy DVD collections of Remington Steele and Moonlighting if they were available.  I think those are about as guilty as my pleasures get...  I'm probably going to put together a Guilty Pleasures mix CD.  Anyone else up for this excerise?

      Despite my ability to access the web, I can't send mail from my work accounts.  This means that although I can receive the mail from people wondering why the hell Hero Indy Clix is considered a game of its own, or why I haven't answered their Very Important Customer Service Query from Thursday, I can't answer them.  Even though Evan announced on the Green Ronin front page that the office was shut down for the week because we're all in Columbus, people are finding their way to the website to click on the customer service feedback link but missing the announcement that there's no one on the other end of the line right now.  Makes it hard to relax when I know that sort of thing is hanging out there, but not much I can do about it until I get back to Seattle.  Meanwhile,  urlLink Pramas  and I are still in Columbus (because the extra $107 for an additional day of hotel made more sense than the $200 per ticket it would have cost to leave when we wanted to.   urlLink Hal  left with the McGlothlins this morning, and I believe Mr. Kenson has also flown home today.   urlLink Greg  and the Amazing Robert Schwalb left last night and both are safely home already.

      Origins 2004 is officially over.  Green Ronin had our best Origins ever, helped in no small part by the fact that we had several new releases timed to be available at the show, and that we had several skilled demoers and events running every day, as well as the efforts the GAMA staff and volunteers made to get more people into the dealer's hall every day.  I'm so miserable about the way the elections and associated GAMA political shit has worked out, and yet so pleased to have been proved right in what we did all year leading up to this show.  I just returned from a company dinner celebration at Buca di Beppo here in Columbus, and after resting for a few minutes I will change clothes and head over to the "Dead Dog Party" for the Origins volunteers to express my sincere thanks for all they've done to make this Origins the best ever.  I'm constantly amazed at the wonderful, giving volunteers we have on our team, and even though I've been thrown out on my ear for my efforts, I can't help but look upon this convention and everyone associated with it with no small amount of love and pride.  We were a kickass team and we accomplished a hell of a lot this year.  I'm deeply saddened to find out that the newly elected board of directors have, in private and without consulting me whatsoever (within four days of being elected) created an "Origins Awards Task Force" and hired one of their key supporters to a paid administrative position to head it.  Had I been consulted, I would have enthusiastically supported their choice to head this "task force" because I agree that he is a wonderful choice for the position.  And I do not object at all to his being paid for his work, because I know first hand how much work is involved in all this GAMA stuff!  He has mouths to feed, as we all do, and I do not begrudge him even one cent of his proposed stipend...not in the slightest. Still, I cannot deny that I am deeply hurt that I did not even merit the basic courtesy of consultation with the board after my four years of service as a board member and my hellish year of Academy Chairmanship.  I'm not surprised that Ryan Dancey doesn't care what I think, but I would have thought that the most basic overture would be made in my direction before an action like this, especially since I am still the Academy Chairman (as they've neither removed me from the position nor have I officially resigned, though both options have been discussed in private).    The most offensive bit is that the current board ran a campaign of accusations and insinuations, and made no secret of their outrage at the fact that the former board hired one of their own (after a full search and review of half a dozen serious candidates).  The insinuation that the former board was hiring its friends, or worse, planning to line their own pockets by hiring each other to paying positions,m was key to the campaign waged by the Dancey/Stever faction.  Much hoo ha over "transparency" was floated to the whole freakin' internet every time the former board took any action whatsoever... and then a mere four days into the "new regime" they turn around and hire one of their key supporters to a paid position without consulting either the membership or the current volunteers affected by their decisions.  I worked very hard as Academy Chair, and I am proud that I was able to accomplish anything at all in the hostile climate under which volunteers and staff alike labored for most of the last 12 months, and I did it all for FREE.  I briefly attended the Hall of Fame banquet event last night, but was unable to stay for the whole thing due to other obligations.  I did make an appearance as the Academy Chair in order to thank all of our guests of honor, Hall of Fame members, and other attendees.  I thanked them for coming, apologized that I was unable to stay for the duration as I had hoped to do, and tried to make it around to every table to at least meet and talk with each Hall of Fame member before I left.  Except for the table where one of the members of the new board was sitting: when I approached that table and began to address them and thank them for coming and apologize for not being able to stay as planned, that member of the board stood up and said, "Let's go get something to eat," and walked away with most of the rest of the table joining him.  To say I felt horribly snubbed and discarded would only give you the faintest hint of how horrible I felt.    They have certainly done their best to make it clear that I am unwelcome in any capacity, but my company has paid its voting dues and believe you me I will be making my voice heard for the duration of my GAMA membership.  It's no secret that they do not value my contributions, but I know that I've done better and contributed more than they're willing to give me credit for, and their denials of me do not change the facts.    Now, off to the party to celebrate the best Origins ever, the best Green Ronin Origins ever, and some of the most under-valued, hardest-working, most wonderful people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing and working with.  As much as it sucks sometimes to have a conscience and a sensitive heart, there are also the benefits of being able to feel something other than petty hatred and selfishness.  I can't say the same for some of the so-called industry "luminaries" GAMA has been graced with in this (as one member put it) "mostly bloodless coup."  I take great comfort knowing that I'm better than that, and so are the people with whom I will be spending my time.  Peace out.

      Origins has been going gangbusters!  Wow, I've been so busy and my legs and feet are KILLING me because I've been standing and walking so much, but we're selling the heck out of our new releases and people are just loving  urlLink Torches & Pitchforks .  Christopher McGlothlin, author of Time of Crisis, has been wonderful with his tireless demoing.  We've also been hosting Matt and Tim from Human Head, who are showing off the  urlLink Dracula's Revenge  board game.  People have been really enjoying Rob's Freeport events, and Graveyard Greg was sweet enough to help us out with our Mutants & Masterminds and Skull & Bones event.    As tiring and stressful as conventions can be, there is also the wonderful chance to talk to our fans, to show our games to new players, to spend time with our industry friends and colleagues, to see the glowing enjoyment young and old alike experience while playing games, painting miniatures, meeting interesting guests and luminaries...conventions are a rollercoaster ride of all the best and some of the worst of the industry.  Despite all of the stuff I've been through so far this week that has been awful, there's no denying that we've been surrounded by all of the best as well.  The awards show was a bit nerve-wracking as we had some technical troubles (from the wrong equipment for showing a contracted video to missing the special tool used to put together the Calliopes) and some missing guests and presenters, but overall I was very relieved and pleased at the way it went.  I ended up having far too much time in the spotlight as I presented some awards myself and presided over some of the Hall of Fame inductions.  I much prefer not to be in the spotlight, but literally ended up in the spotlight at this show.  Despite the cruel comments made by people who were not interested in seeing Luke Ski perform at the awards, even the person who (prior to the ceremony) told me that he didn't intend to come because it sounded like a horrible waste of three hours of his life somehow decided to attend anyway and later admitted (literally in passing) that it all turned out ok.  In fact, Luke's performance of "Stealing Like a Hobbit" was a nice break between the sad memorial for Don Turnbull and the remainder of the awards for the night.  I was incredibly honored to be able to be a part of the ceremony to honor the contributions of all of our Hall of Fame members.  I was a grinning fool just to be present to see our assembled members, let alone have the pleasure of being allowed to personally, formally induct Reiner Knizia into the Hall of Fame.  Tonight was the Hall of Fame banquet, where attendees and exhibitors were able to buy a ticket that included a nice buffet meal and the opportunity to sit with and discuss game design or whatever else struck your fancy with the likes of Sandy Peterson, Jim Dunnigan, Liz Danforth, Lou Zocchi, and all of the other attendees.  Unfortunately for me, I was only able to attend the banquet for a brief time, just long enough to thank everyone for attending and apologize that I was expected at another event.  Tomorrow is the last day of the convention.  I expect to hear a report that the numbers are up and that we are going to beat our projections.  I'm trying to think of what I can do after the convention to thank the tireless efforts of GAMA's staff and Volunteers.  They have worked so amazingly hard to make sure this convention was a smooth-running as possible, and that any difficulties were handled as quickly and with as little disruption as possible.  SO much of what GAMA's people have done has been to shield everyone else from anything that might detract from them getting their full enjoyment out of their convention experience.  Certainly there will always be incidents, challenges, and difficulties but I believe this convention has reflected wonderfully well on everyone involved and they deserve the deepest thanks of everyone dedicated to the game play and enjoyment.

      From a just about every perspective I could hold, Thursday at Origins was fantastic.  Green Ronin had excellent traffic at the booth, lots of enthusiastic participants in our Torches & Pitchforks and Dracula's Revenge demos, and best-ever sales for a first day at Origins.  We have such a great group of booth volunteers and demo guys this year.  Even my demo guys who couldn't come to the show at the last minute overwhelmingly went out of their way to make sure I had everything I might need, including giving me their adventures for others to run, color character sheets complete with illos of their villains and so on.  From an operational perspective, even though our team was booted off the board and the staff utterly demoralized by the new regime, it doesn't diminish what they've accomplished under tremendous stress this year.  Origins attendance for the first day was up by 46% or something crazy like that and many, many of those people were in the exhibit hall (which was a major complaint from exhibitors last year...so many good events, attendees didn't come to the exhibit hall because they were busy gaming 23.5 hours a day).  The computers did not go down during registration, and despite the increased crowds the longest line of the day was only 36 minutes.  Not to say everything has gone uniformly smoothly, or that no attendees have had issues, those things always pop up on an individual basis.  Judging the organizational foundations we've set up here, I can still take pride in the job being well done, and so I shall.  Two volunteers were assigned to help me handle Origins Awards-related tasks and they worked their asses off for me yesterday.  These women spent four hours going around to the attendees to gather samples of their nominated products for the display, for just one example.  Tonight is the Origins Awards Ceremony and the Hall of Fame 30th anniversary celebration.  Mark Santillo, the Origins events manager, went all out in honor of our Hall of Famers and his goal was to bring every living Hall of Famer to the show.  If he didn't manage to do it, he got as close as possible, and I'm extremely honored to be part of this event tonight.  The New Regime may well intend to enact the Dancey Platform of a complete tear-down of the Origins Awards but tonight at least we have the opportunity to honor our gaming roots going all the way back to the Charles Roberts Awards.  Any bitter assholes who have the balls to actually attend this gathering and then come and share their opinions to my face (and that includes my otherwise sensible colleague who opined that Origins is a "Nice little con, but GenCon does everything it does, and better," based on attending it once years ago) are welcome to find me after the show and do so.  After about 11:00pm tonight, I'm not going to give a damn anyway.

      So, the elections were the farce and travesty some of us feared they were going to be.  After spending the first half of the general membership meeting going over all of the incredibly positive things accomplished by the current GAMA board and staff, it was all completely moot because the opposition slate walked in with handfuls of voting proxies from companies who could not even be bothered to attend the meeting...in some cases, companies who joined the organization as voting members mere minutes before the start of the meeting.  There was never any open, honest debate.  There was no fair consideration of the qualifications of the candidates.  The fate of the candidates not part of the "Fair, Firm, and Friendly" party was sealed by handshakes amongst friends and business partners behind the scenes before the meeting even started and I found the whole thing utterly appalling.  The only thing left hanging over my head now is the Origins Awards ceremony for the year, which I'm sure to take unending rafts of shit for but will see through to the end nonetheless. After that, I wish them good luck and good riddance.

      Through pure happenstance, I dropped by R&C's unannounced and happened upon a planned gathering, where Bill and Chris and Rev and Jenny and visiting Peter were assembled to watch Badder Santa (the DVD release of Bad Santa).  We were enticed to stay for the film, and oh, it was worth it.  What a wonderful, awful, fantastic film!    It was nice to see Peter on his West Coast vacation, as we've missed him on two other occasions.  As others have said, I wouldn't have known him with his new clean-shaven, short-haired look, but I've had months to get used to it through his Livejournal.  Apparently, Rev's car was stolen again!  Either he's a nexus for weird bad luck, or he's got a wacky secret stalker.  Weird!  Chris and I catch the red-eye in mere minutes, so I'd better split.  Will post updates concerning my bid for GAMA President and the Origins Awards as time allows.

      It's four o'clock in the freakin' morning.  It was hot yesterday, and the entire neighborhood is sleeping with windows open, because Seattle doesn't have air conditioning.  Hint to my neighbors: Now is not a good time to have the tow truck that is dropping your junky car off worry about meticulously backing it into exactly the parking spot you want in front of my house.    Yes, you did wake me from a dead sleep (the best sleep I'd been having all week, thanks) because of the incessant beeping of the tow truck. No, I don't typically hang out on my front porch at four o'clock in the morning.  Hint to my other neighbors with the house alarm or car alarm or whatever it is that's been whoop, whoop, whooping for the last twenty minutes: just because you can sleep through this racket does not mean that the rest of the neighborhood remains blissfully undisturbed.  Get up and shut the damn thing off already.

      Recently, a platform of candidates announced their intentions to run for GAMA offices at the upcoming elections on Wednesday. Their slate of officers includes Don Perrin for President, Doug Ferguson (of Pokemon USA) for Vice President, and Ryan Dancey for Treasurer.  I, also, intend to run again this year. After four years on the board as an at-large director, I am stepping forward for the seat of President, left vacant by the current President who is not running for re-election.  I'm including here my platform (shared with others on the board who have graciously agreed to run again after a gruelling 12 months) and my admittedly long position statement. None of us take this decision to run again lightly.   We would like to announce our intention to run for the following positions:  Nicole Lindroos, candidate, GAMA President John Kaufeld, candidate, GAMA Vice President Bruce Neidlinger, candidate, GAMA Treasurer  We feel we are appropriate choices for those positions due to our previous experience with GAMA and feel that the results in 2003/2004 justify our election. We are dedicated people who work hard and this is what we will do when we are elected to the GAMA BOD. We are not including candidates for the position of Secretary as we feel that Brian Dalrymple is an excellent choice for that position.  We feel that GAMA has several important tasks that must be accomplished:  * Continue the successful administration of the GAMA Trade Show and Origins  * Continue to professionalize and improve GAMA's current staff and infrastructure  * Improve financial and member information accounting and reporting  * Increase programmatic spending  * Increase affinity programs and other direct benefits  * Increase awareness of GAMA's indirect benefits  * Increase membership on the manufacturer level to increase access to affinity programs   GENERAL POSITION STATEMENT  As we enter the mid-point of 2004, GAMA finds itself emerging from a period of growth and transition and about to enter a time of unprecedented success and stability. We have arrived at this moment because of the hard work of the game industry's volunteers, GAMA's staff and GAMA's Board of Directors. The upcoming election will be about the big choices GAMA's members have to make to secure prosperity across the board for game manufacturers and their strategic partners. The GAMA Board stands ready to meet that challenge and to build on our achievements.  For the first time, GAMA has issued an Annual Report that clearly outlines the state of the organization. From that report, we can see that GAMA is in the best shape of its history. The fiscal controls instituted over the last two years have paid off with unprecedented financial stability, allowing GAMA to increase its programmatic spending and offer more benefits to its members. New centralized offices in Columbus have strengthened our relationship with the city and improved GAMA's accessibility to vendors and our enthusiastic pool of students and volunteers. We have filled long-vacant positions, expanding GAMA's ability to communicate to its members and to the public at large. Our convention operations have provided attendees with improved programming, negotiated and secured favorable contracts with venues and vendors, and have increased both attendance and attendee satisfaction. Good programs bring people in and well-executed programming keeps them coming back.  This moment is one of possibility, but success is not guaranteed. We must remember that GAMA's achievements were accomplished only through creativity and hard work; with a willingness to innovate and imagine; and always with a commitment to GAMA's mission of promoting the general interest of all persons engaged in the buying, selling, licensing, or manufacturing of gaming products. And all of it can stall under the wrong leadership. We believe that to further the general interests of the game industry we need not abandon the course which has been set leading into these elections.  THE PLATFORM   Staff Retention  GAMA must work to retain its current staff. As a non-profit, GAMA, cannot provide rewards in terms of money and benefits in line with comparable jobs in the corporate world. People who work for non-profit organizations do so because they have a passion for the organization's mission, and extra care must be taken that trained, motivated, devoted staff members do not work in an environment where they are allowed to burn out. GAMA must continue to professionalize its staff and firm up its infrastructure. We must be diligent to maintain staffing levels so that, in turn, the staff can be tasked with realistic, achievable goals and experience an environment of success, trust, and respect. GAMA must secure appropriate benefits for its employees and reward them for their successes with appropriate bonuses, flex time, and chance for promotion.   Fiscal Discipline  We must continue the fiscal discipline that has been the hallmark of the past two years. This means we must continue to run Origins Game Expo and the GAMA Trade Show well and increase GAMA's discretionary budget. Now that the offices are centralized, we must finish installing our internal control and financial reporting system. We must generate more frequent reports and establish audit procedures that have been lacking throughout the association's history.   Commitment to Member Benefits  We must use our unprecedented prosperity to secure more benefits for our membership. This process has begun already with the implementation of member rebates for GAMA members exhibiting at Origins and the GAMA Trade Show, and the affinity program with Krause Publications for advertising discounts and subscription services for GAMA members. Other benefits are already in process, including a plan for outreach to local and national media outlets and enacting focused press releases for member companies, and a massive internet services revamp that will increase the look, ease of use, and general functionality of GAMA's website, mailing lists, bulletin boards, and chat rooms. We must continue to dedicate staff attention to GAMA's web presence so that it works better, costs less, and is in line with the rest of the on-line world. We must provide the membership with more opportunity to participate in key decisions and communicate with the public at large. We must institute a membership Welcome Kit that outlines the member benefits, staff contacts, and resources at each member's disposal, to be delivered immediately upon joining the organization. We will create member toolkits to help fight digital piracy, to publicize venues for product reviews and awards, and to extend a GAMA member discount from national suppliers and shippers, including Office Depot, Staples, Federal Express, UPS, Kinko's and more.   Seizing Opportunities  The game industry's strength lies in the creativity and innovation of its members. GAMA must do more to enhance existing alliances between publishers, retailers, wholesalers, conventioneers, and the media. We will continue expanding the breadth of GTS attendees by inviting companies that supply our business needs, including printers, designers, fixtures suppliers, and business consultants. We must strive to open new markets to gaming products in North America and around the world. Increased cooperation and trade with partners in other game, toy, and hobby industries ultimately leads to further innovations, stability, and growth in our sector. Using the position of GAMA Ambassador, we will undertake a membership drive and outreach program and increase membership and participation of all eligible companies. We will establish, train, and promote a member-focused GAMA speaker's bureau that's available to groups around the country.  To accomplish these things, we need the right tools. We need to continue on the course we've set, applying the considerable talents of our staff and volunteers to the task of addressing the challenges that we recognize before us without derailing the abundant progress and momentum that has already been achieved.  Let's hope the voting membership agrees.

      Well, not so very frightening but I couldn't resist the title.    Thursday night I was jolted awake by what seemed like a distant explosion.  Groggy, not entirely sure I hadn't dreamed the noise, I was laying tensely in my bed and listening intently for any other noise when the room lit up with a flash.  We were having a thunder storm!  Coming from the midwest, thunderstorms are a way of life, and nearly as common as the rain itself.  Not so in Seattle.  Thunder and lightning are very rare here.  One of Kate's most vivid memories so far in her childhood was the night we had a thunder *snowstorm* and it sounded as if the thunder and lightning were centered over our house, booming and flashing (and *snowing*)!  It was very exciting, I can see why it stuck with her.  I scooted out of bed, must have been 2:00AM, and sat out on the porch in the warm, humid night.  The storm was not particularly violent, the rain slapping down in thick drops.  By the time I got out there to enjoy it, it was mostly past and moving on to who knows where. I haven't sat out on a summer night to enjoy a thunderstorm in probably 20 years, and even this slight snippet of one filled me with an exhilarated calm, a feeling like a visit home.  I slept well when I went back inside.

      Today I have been bludgeoned by the ugly mean-spiritedness of the game industry.  Not only that, but it's been like a bizarre distortion of everything I love and cherish about the industry and the people I've worked with in my career.  Taking a page directly out of 1984, I've literally seen people who have been extremely liberal with ugly insinuation and utterly reliant on back-room alliance building title their actions "fair" and "friendly" and refuse to have open discussion all while trumpeting "transparency."  It's been mind-boggling.  In any other business, an employee who discovered a critical systems failure, who saved the business hundreds of thousands of dollars, who successfully managed multiple crises while safeguarding the business's key assets would be trumpeted as a hero, would see something like a raise, a bonus, or a promotion for his work.  In the game industry, apparently, all that kind of skill and devotion will earn you is a pat on the back.  "Thanks for holding down the fort, buddy.  Now, meet your new boss.  He'll be running things now that the hard work is done."  I witnessed plenty of people "failing upwards" at Wizards of the Coast and elsewhere, so I suppose it should be no surprise to me, but I do always set my heart on trying for the best outcome.  Capping off a sad day, in which a member of an online community I frequent succumbed to a two-pronged attack on his health from a particularly virulent virus and cancer that refused to be budged, while still feeling sad and teary about a young life cut short in such a miserable way, I got to read a particularly foul characterization of something I've put a great deal of work into from someone I had considered to be a respected colleague.  The respect was a one-way street, though, as he uncorked with a truly stunning tirade that took soul-bruising swings at everyone not considered to be on the A-List as far as game design credentials go, and called the Origins Awards (which really are just meant to be an "Atta Boy" from your colleagues for a job well done) "a celebratory glory-hole of wretched vanity and caterwauling egotism that aspires to a twenty-dollar streetwalker's idea of glamor" among other things. Ah yes, meanness is so very, very clever.  Especially good if you can throw in a couple of words like "arriviste" and slam D20 and PDF publishers and mock the working class for their relative poverty and lack of Armani.  I'm disgusted by it all, and you no matter how many times you tell me war is peace, and we've always been at war with Eastasia, I refuse to buy it.  It's shameful and boggling to think of how many people DO buy it.

      Chris's birthday today.  I was pleased when the first issue of the subscription to Giant Robot I got him arrived today.  His parents once again shipped two 3-pound live lobsters from Boston, and sweet, buttery sea bugs were devoured for lunch.    Went to Bucca di Beppo with the game group for dinner.  It's apparently the local birthday mecca, as there were at least five other birthdays being celebrated in our immediate area (not counting the folks who didn't inform the wait staff it was a birthday event).  The place was packed with groups our size or larger (and there were seven of us!).  We're out of town for two consecutive game nights due to Origins, but everyone seems to be eagerly awaiting the start of our Warhammer game.   urlLink Tim  had potentially happy news that an unpleasant situation that's been stressing him out may reach a satisfactory resolution soon.  We have a nice group of friends and I like them to be happy.  A few years ago, I kidnapped Chris from work and took him directly to a bed and breakfast I'd found, where I'd rented a fine suite and where we engaged in decadent behavior.  Another year we were in the Washington DC area over his birthday (the year we were traveling between his cousin's wedding and my brother's wedding, I think) and Chris was incredibly patient with me as I dragged him off to meet mom-friends of mine with their kids the same age as Kate, when what he really longed to be doing was visiting historic battlefields.  Last year I reserved a great room at a middle eastern restaurant and several of our friends joined us for eats and drinks.    This year's gift of a magazine subscription seems gross and lame in comparison. It does not nearly convey my adoration for my husband, my devotion to his happiness, the love I feel for him and the gratitude for each day we get to spend together.  As  urlLink Liz says , he's obnoxious, funny, true, and mean.  He makes me laugh every single day, he's far smarter and more clever than I am, and he's not afraid to do exactly what he wants to do.  Every day I find him remarkable, delicious, and unlike anyone else I've ever known.  Happy birthday, punk.  May you have all that your heart desires.

      Recapping the last week:  I've been too damn busy.  Too much to do before Origins, just too much.  Joined Flexcar since there's no telling when my claim with the car might be settled.  Thinking of getting rid of the damn thing and not worrying about it anymore.  Seattle is having some weird cold snap.  I finally got my heirloom tomato seedlings from Seeds of Change (shipped over a month later than originally predicted) and transplanted them, only to have all but one die in the cold.  The middle of June should not find me in my footie jammies!  We've had *highs* in the fifties.  It's absurd.    Chris and I went out to McCormicks Thursday because Kate was at outdoor camp with her class overnight.  Figured we'd have a drink and take advantage of their oyster happy hour (fifty cent oysters).  It was ridiculously cold out.  We sat down, I ordered a Diet Pepsi and was promptly carded.  I HATE being carded.  It is a HUGE hot button of mine: I am your customer, I am not a criminal.  I will be 35 this year, I am a wife, a mother, a homeowner, a business owner, what the hell more do I have to do to be recognized as an adult and allowed to go about my life without being hassled?  I didn't even order alcohol!  It completely ruined my mood and I couldn't wait to get out of the place.  I don't patronize establishments that treat me like a potential criminal when I walk in the door.  We've decided to trash the Lord of the Rings game as none of us enjoyed the system.  When Chris announced that he'd decided to scrap it, we actually breathed a sigh of relief. Instead we're going to start up a Warhammer Fantasy Role Play game when we get back from Origins.  We made up chartacters last session and it was such a breath of fresh air.  I'm really looking forward to playing.  Unfortunately, Chris's birthday falls on next game night, then Origins travel screws up two more weeks.  Will just have to be patient.  Have been having insomnia again.  Fall asleep for three or four hours and then jolt awake for no good reason.  Last night was pretty typical: fell asleep hard by 11:00, then was awake and tossing and turning by 1:00am.  Finally gave up and got out of bed for a couple hours, tried falling asleep on the couch about 3:30am, but jolted awake certain that I heard a thump of something falling upstairs.  Prowled around looking for the source of the noise, found nothing, finally went back to bed and fell asleep around 4:00am and woke up around 7:30 because it was light out and Kate was awake.  The Myth of Reagan is greatly irritating me.  I am sorry for his family's loss, having lost my own grandmother to Alzheimers, and having seen my own stoic, strong grandfather openly sobbing at the funeral, I do not make light of their loss or the difficult and awful circumstances of death by Alzheimers.  But that whole bit about how he woke up, opened his eyes and recognized the love of his life before taking his last breath?  That does not happen.  It is not possible.  It is possible to honor his service to the country as President without resorting to false miracles to secure his saintly status.  And the rest of the well-honed rhetoric about his political contributions are still up for debate.  There's no need to bring up Iran-Contra, Grenada, star wars, trickledown economics, the AIDs crisis, the increase in homelessness and the dumping of the mentally ill, or nuclear proliferation at the man's funeral, but let's also not just sweep all that under the rug in our hurry to slap his likeness on monuments and money!

      I leave for the airport in a couple of hours, and won't be home again until Friday night.  I've arranged for Kate to go to after school care on Thursday so she can attend the end of year school performance with friends from her class.  I'm going to miss it, cementing her teacher's opinion of me that I'm an uninvolved parent.  Talked with Kate's reading teacher because I haven't heard anything about the results of the testing I'd requested at the March Intervention Team meeting we had.  I signed the papers authorizing the testing April 1st, and it's "still in process" which leaves Kate pretty well high and dry until next year.  The reading teacher did tell me she's pretty sure Kate will "qualify for services" next year based on the results of the testing so far.  Not sure what any of this means.  It's very difficult to be an advocate for your child when you don't even know what the problem is.  Yesterday was Tim's birthday, so we called off gaming and all trooped off to have steaks and other goodies at The Brooklyn.  Kate was a little squirrelly but I think a good time was had by all.  My black tiger prawns in brandy cream sauce were out of this world.  Kate ate bread, about three bites of clam chowder, and two gigantic shirley temples.  When we left it seemed like Tim and Bruce may have been locked into the parking garage they used, but Bruce gave me a ring after we went our separate ways to let me know they'd gotten the car out ok.  We were able to catch a bus immediately and Kate fell asleep on us on the way home.  Please keep fingers crossed for me that this trip is productive.  Much needs to be accomplished and there are forces at work attempting to prevent the job from being done.

      I found myself in an almost giddy good mood yesterday.  Like a tremendous weight had been lifted from me.  I floated through the day.  Today is beautifully sunny, and Kate is spending the weekend here instead of with her dad.  I intend to go out and enjoy some Mommy-Daughter time in the sunshine shortly.  Life is good, and I can't for the life of me stop smiling.

      One of the best purchases I made at Comic Con was the "We Are Not All Jerks"  urlLink Shirt  from the  urlLink Dumbrella  booth.  Truly, I've been discouraged and ashamed and more than a little hopeless.  Being an American just doesn't seem to mean the what I grew up believing it meant.  Bless his gentle heart,  urlLink Jimmy Carter's speech  at the Democratic Convention lays out exactly what needs to be done.  He can still see the America I once believed existed.  I hope we have the chance to try to get it back.  Meanwhile, I guess I'll just wear my shirt and apologize a lot.

      Seen, hanging over every check-out line, in an Oregon grocery store (where I'd stopped to replenish my cooler with drinks and fresh fruit), laminated color signs advertising the arrival of fresh, dark Oregon cherries.  Against the background photo of the fruit, only two words.  THERE HERE.

       I had a vivid dream in which all manner of personal betrayals played out. I have awakened, feeling the weight of emotion on me, every ounce of rage,betrayal, hurt, and disbelief riding along on the surface of my consciousnessas if the events of the dream had really happened to me, just now.  I've lived these feelings before in real circumstances.  I've hoped to never have to feel them again, especially the feelings of betrayal.  It's disturbing to have them triggered by a dream.  In the dark strangeness of the hotel room, in my uncomfortable hotel bed, I toss and turn trying to rest at ease. Through the thin hotel walls I hear a baby mewling in the next room.  Trains rumble along, tooting their horns and triggering the clanging crossing guards. The dream holds tight and refuses to fade away with the rising sun.   I dreamed I was in a sandwich shop.  Some of my business partners were there, milling around fixing sandwiches as I mulled over some unpleasant information. The guy who waltzed into Chris's cubical within a day of having maneuvered himself into being Chris's new boss and gleefully told him to toss out all the work he'd been doing over the last year was involved in these goings on somehow.  So was the guy who made sure all references to Chris were removed from the company's products after Chris left the company (regardless of thefact that they were actually reprinting his work and words). Guys who'd used their positions as Brand Manager to fuck with everything Chris touched were extending their slimy tentacles into our new business somehow, though what exactly had happened is not clear to me.  The overwhelming feeling was one of deep, personal betrayal.   You thought we were friends, but I'm fucking you over.  You thought you could trust me, but I was just using you for my own glorification.  I'm using things I've gleaned about you to further my own agenda, smiling to your face while stabbing you in the back the instant it's turned to me.   One of my new colleagues set a sandwich down in front of me.  Looking at it from outside of the dream, it was very much like the ice cream party Wizards of the Coast threw for the remaining staff after one of their rounds of layoffs, as if ice cream would make the remaining workers forget that people they'd worked with for over a decade had just been politely escorted from the building. As he walked away, I put the events together and blurted out, "They all knew!  They've known this whole time."  The guy I thought was one of my oldest friends knew what would happen.  My new colleagues had been informed.  They knew, they were complicit, they participated in masking the charade until it was revealed to me, merely a pawn and a player.  The last thing in the world I wanted was a sandwich. A neutral party in the sandwich shop said of my other colleagues, "Wow, they sure turned pale when you said that."  The horrible truth sinks in, we've been screwed again.    The intense feelings brought bubbling up by this dream begin to fade.  Despite the trains and the traffic noises, despite the yahoo in the next room blabbing and roaring as if he were a Norse storyteller, my eyes droop again and I feel the tension of the unpleasant memories mixed with remnants of dream flow out of my body and over the thin hotel mattress. The challenges of packing the car with too many convention left overs and beginning the long drive home still lie ahead of me, but at last I think I may be able to sleep again for another hour or two.    Please let it be dreamless.

      Just like Vegas in March, I arrived in San Diego feeling just fine.  One or two nights in air conditioning, though, and I'm sick as a dog.  Ridiculous head cold, horribly sore and swollen throat.  The air conditioning seems to be what really does it to me, for whatever reason.  Bad filters?  Air too dry or too moist?  I have no idea, but it makes me a really ineffective booth staffer, let me tell you.   It took a good hour last night for the crowd of people let in for ComicCon's "Preview Night" to filter through the huge building and end up in our little corner of the hall. There are a few more hobby game industry people exhibiting this year.  Of course the big guys like WizKids, Wizards/Hasbro and Upper Deck are here, but for the most part there aren't a lot of small publishers here.  I'm not sure that I'd recommend it for most of the folks from our corner, either.  We're here because we've got comic properties like The Nocturnals and The Red Star in RPG form, plus our generic Mutants & Masterminds line.  Even so, it's a bit of a stretch to make it all relevant to the Comic Con attendees, I think.  Folks like Adventure Retail, repping Atlas and Steve Jackson Games, plus a wide variety of other games and game-geek paraphernalia (dice, cthulhu plushies) are really in a much  better position to make Comic Con a significant stop on their summer convention tour.  The coolest thing I've seen at Comic Con so far is the  urlLink Red Tango  booth near us, with gorgeous retro kitty goodies.  They must be mine!  Nothing to do with comics, but I lust for them anyway.

      I've always been something of a driving fool.  Hitting my driving years in rural Minnesota, I thought nothing of driving 45 minutes to go see a movie or driving all over creation just because I had nothing better to do.  In my final year of high school, I was taking two classes at the high school, then driving for an hour to take a full load of classes at the nearest community college for dual credit through Minnesota's Post-Secondary Options program.  As a young twenty-something, I thought nothing of a 24-hour drive to get myself back and forth from Georgia to Minnesota. I drove with a friend to my first GAMA Trade Show at the Tropicana in Las Vegas, then drove solo from Las Vegas, up the coast to Portland and back to Minnesota.    I haven't been on a haul-ass multi-day drive in many years.  Monday morning, I woke at 4am for no good reason, and spent the morning burning mixed CDs from iTunes songs for the drive since I couldn't sleep.  After loading the car, Chris and I hopped to it and I drove us all the way to Sacramento before having to stop for the night.  Woohoo, I still have it!  NO denying that I'm far more sore and tired than I would have been ten years ago, but it's nice to know I can still pull off a major driving stunt when necessary.  We arrived in lovely San Diego by mid-afternoon, no problem.  A mere final leg of 500 miles, ha!  Comic Con officially starts tomorrow, but tonight is "Preview Night" which means we're going to have to set up our booth and be there ready to work for two or three hours tonight, starting about 5:30pm.  San Diego is a beautiful city and I've thoroughly enjoyed my trips here.  The only bummer so far (aside from the $145/night hotel rooms) has been the additional parking fee the hotel charges. That cost me $100!  Shit.

      I signed up with the folks behind the monorail recall this week.  I will admit up front, I voted against the monorail initiative when last it appeared on the ballot.  I was willing to be won over after the plan's narrow victory at the polls a couple of years ago, but everything that has come out, everything that has solidified in the plan, has only raised more doubts and questions for me.    I am not an opponent of public transit. If anything, my seven months of carlessness have made me appreciate what transit options we have in Seattle and support even more strongly expanding those options.  I've lived in Portland and Atlanta and Vancouver, BC, (all areas with vastly superior public transit). I've spent enough time in New York City to understand my non-driver husband's nostalgic laments for the subway.      I understand that these projects take money and lots of it.  I'm not trying to avoid the burden of taxes, or the inconveniences of construction.  I'm not on the side that crank Tim Eyeman, who objected to the monorail groups plan to set aside contracts for women and minorities.  But what I want is a sensible plan, a realistic budget and time-table, and a project that will serve the city (not just the contractors who get the big money for doing the work).  This current monorail plan is already showing itself to be grossly under-funded and veering from the general concept that was put before the voters the first time around.

       urlLink Tim  loaned me his battered copy of  urlLink Liege-Killer, The Paratwa Saga, Book 1 , by  urlLink Christopher Hinz  the last time I was at his place. I'm not one to normally delve into science fiction (or science fantasy, or even just plain ol' fantasy) but this book really grabbed me.  Excellent reading, and I've started myself on the sequel,  urlLink Ash Ock  already.    I also received a surprise package and a thank you from an industry friend and colleague today, much to my shock and delight.  He sent me  urlLink History of Food  by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat (translated from the French by Anthea Bell) in all of its 800 pages of hardbacked glory, and such a kind note just thanking me for the things I've said and done.  It is this kind of gentle thoughtfulness that is present in the game community and that inspires me to carry on after a legion of Comic Book Guys and Cat Piss Men (and let's not forget the Arrogant Elite) have beaten me down and spit on my efforts.  What a dichotomy the game industry is.  If I could just figure out a way to have the good without the rest of it...

      Back in 1975, Canadian prog rockers Rush released Bastille Day on their third album, Caress of Steel.  ...Power isn't all that money buys  indeed.     There's no bread, let them eat cake There's no end to what they'll take Flaunt the fruits of noble birth Wash the salt into the earth  But they're marching to Bastille Day La guillotine will claim her bloody prize Free the dungeons of the innocent The king will kneel, and let his kingdom rise  Bloodstained velvet, dirty lace Naked fear on every face See them bow their heads to die As we would bow as they rode by  And we're marching to Bastille Day La guillotine will claim her bloody prize Sing, o choirs of cacophony The king has kneeled, to let his kingdom rise.  Lessons taught but never learned All around us anger burns Guide the future by the past Long ago the mould was cast  For they marched up to Bastille Day La guillotine claimed her bloody prize Hear the echoes of the centuries Power isn't all that money buys    Happy Bastille Day, France.

      Posted to the Academy membership e-mail list a short time ago...    Dear Academy Members:  As you know, Matt Forbeck is heading a taskforce to look at the Origins Awards. There has been discussion within the taskforce mailing list as to the function of the Academy. There is even a possibility that the Academy may not exist after the taskforce recommendations.  I have asked Nicole Lindroos to step down as Academy Chair. I will not be asking anyone to step into the role to replace her. Until the GAMA Board of Directors hears the taskforce recommendations, the Academy is without a purpose. In the taskforce recommendations, we will either find that the Academy has a new and invigorated mandate, or no mandate at all. If it turns out to be the latter, I don't want someone left "holding the bag." Nicole Lindroos has done excellent service to GAMA and the Academy, and I do not wish any future actions of I or the Board of Directors tarnishing that.  If the taskforce does recommend that the Academy continue, and with an invigorated mandate, I will name a new Chair at that time.  The Academy Chair will remain empty until further notice.  Thank you.  Don Perrin --  Don Perrin GAMA President www.gama.org    This turn of events was not unexpected, but I remain sad to see that all the work I've done for the last year stands to be swept aside and done away with nonetheless. A year of my life, shamelessly wasted.  Squandered.    Don't I feel foolish...

      I discovered two of them having sex virtually under my kitchen window last evening!  The sideyard between my house and the park (this is a toddler park, definitely not for big kids) is *maybe* 6 feet, and they were in the bushes right up against my fence.  I wouldn't have noticed them at all except the girl was squealing and laughing and making a ruckus that I could hear from inside the house, and when I looked down from the kitchen window, there was the top of this boy's head and the girl's feet up in the air!  They under-estimated what a nosy busybody I am.  :)  First I tried to scare them off by going to the front porch and moving some things around.  Then I went into the sideyard itself to retrieve some gardening tools.  The girl was laying there, looking up at me, laughing her head off.  The young man at least had the decency to avert his face and look a little ashamed of himself.  I grabbed my weed-whacker and said, as I walked by, "This is not an appropriate place for that activity."  or some other such lameass comment.  I was actually a lot more embarrassed by them than I thought I'd be. The girl continued to think this was the funniest thing ever and howled with laughter.  I then puttered around in the back yard for a while until they left.  Just looked out my kitchen window again, and they're back in the park this afternoon.  The girl is brazen!  She's up on the kiddie play equipment, saw me looking out the window and just started laughing again.  If I'd been caught in her position, I'd have been mortified and never gone within blocks of the place again.  At least this time they still have their clothes on.  This park is also an occasional gathering place for kids who want to hang out and smoke dope around dusk.  I've caught a few whiffs, on occasion.

      Anyone know why I can't open the comments on my blog (the Blogger version, not the Livejournal)?  I've just started using Firefox, and when I try to display the comments on Discolor Online, I get a message saying that I've chosen to open a binary file.  While it asks "What should Firefox do with this file?" the only option I'm allowed is Save to Disk, which downloads my comments as a colorfully formatted Excel file.  Pain in the ass, and I'm not enough the computer geek to have a clue why it's doing this.  Anyone else?

      Thursday: Picked Kate up.  Shook off the post-Origins depression long enough to have a mini "Girl's Day" with her.  We shopped, got haircuts, played together, and I forgot my sadness and disappointment for a while.  Love my girl.  Friday: As sign of how full of stress and unhappiness I've been, I staggered through Friday like a drunk.  I returned my rental car. Met Evan on Capitol Hill for coffee, where we monopolized the Starbuck's comfy leather chairs for a couple of hours and I spilled my aching guts to a sympathetic ear.  It's been too long since Evan and I had a coffee date. I talked too much, but I needed the shoulder of a real friend on Friday and Evan was there for me as he's been in the past.  Despite my faults.  Saturday: Spiderman 2 with people with other friends.  Had a lovely time, enjoyed the movie and the company.  Went to R&C's for grilling afterward and was struck by spontaneous narcolepsy.  Had to excuse myself to the back room for a nap, where I crashed hard and slipped immediately into intense, disconcerting dreams.  Woke in time to join the crew for dinner, but ended up staying the night as Chris and Ray had another marathon discussion about game design.  Kate and I just curled up in the spare room.  Sunday: Bruce picked us up for dim sum at Sun Ya in the International District.  Again, for no good reason, I found myself struggling against crushing fatigue.  I literally fell into bed for a couple of hours as soon as we got back from dim sum, and instead of doing anything social for the 4th, we stayed home and eventually just watched fireworks on tv.  I had to put earplugs in to sleep that night, as our neighbors were incredibly festive and shooting off fireworks until after midnight.  Monday: Woke at 3:30am after anguishing dreams.  Managed to get a couple hours more sleep between 5:30am and 7:00am.  First day with my new Flexcar account.  Broke it in by going down to Bruce and Tim's barbecue.  Wonderful time!  Kate was a little hyper, but she gets that way when she's been up too late the night before (as she'd been for the 4th) so I should have predicted.  Good fun, good friends, good food.  Finished reading The Anubis Gates again, which I'd forgotten so much of it was like reading a whole new book.  Borrowed Leige-Killer and Ash Ock from Tim.  Intent on keeping my brain distracted.

My results:   You are an  urlLink SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower . This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments.

You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted.

      Sunday Kate declared we should have Bed Day.  We would retire to my bed in our pajamas, watch movies, play games, and eat junky food.  Kate created a the menu for the day: donuts, corn chips, cheese dip, cheetos, soda, soup (Campbells Chicken & Stars  urlLink Soup at Hand , specifically), avocado, and pie.  I dutifully picked up her requests from the store, and an assortment of Kate-friendly videos and DVDs that wouldn't make my own brain melt out of my ears.  A selection of Little Rascals classics,  urlLink Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure , Monty Python.  We crawled into my bed, watched videos, ate delicious junk, dressed Kate's Polly pockets, and she tried valiantly to get us to play some MagBlast but that never happened. We capped off bed day by watching a dozen Strong Bad E-Mails.  Kate drew  urlLink Trogdor the Burninator  for me, full of majesty and "consonant Vs" (said Kate) before I finally forced her to go to bed for real.  Monday we all ended up down at the Pike Place Market around breakfast time, and ended up with a ringside seat to the press conference that announced  urlLink Farm Aid  would be happening here in the Seattle area.  Got to see the Seattle Mayor give a little speech about how Farm Aid brings together two things that Seattle loves: music and food.  I pretended to be excited about it, so that Kate might also be excited about seeing the mayor of her city giving a speech about something she could grok.  She's just a smidge too young to be entirely cynical already.  I think it worked, she was at least mildly interested.  Kate's back in Canada for a couple of weeks before we all head out to Indianapolis for GenCon. I had to break it to her that we weren't going to DragonCon this year after all, which meant no road trip to Hershey PA "on the way."  She's a good sport about it, though, and I'm going to devote the last two weeks of her summer vacation to doing some fun, family things with her that have nothing to do with conventions.  Probably nothing as tantalizing to her imagination as a chocolate theme park, sadly.
