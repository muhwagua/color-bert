      Well this is my first official post in my blogger. Because there is a new set up I am able to have my own blog now. Pretty cool! Now i can babble with the best of them.   LOL As James said in his blog the other day, I will be taking my Praxis II test for Special Education: Core Knowledge and Exceptional Students: Emotional Disorders. Anyway, it is now paid for and i have been studying for both tests. I take the tests June 12th. Once i take the tests and get my application in again with additional information and send in 75.00. I will be officially applying to get into the PACE program which is simply explained Alternative Certification Program they have in SC for those people that would like to become a teacher but have a different degree. Once i get into the program, I will be eligible to get a job at one of the schools. During the next 3 yrs I will be teaching and each year i take a graduate course pertaining to my specific specialty which is Emotional Disorders. There is a shortage for teachers that can teach kids with this specific problem. I am excited that i am finally realizing something i have been wanting for the past 15 or more years.   In the meantime, school is fixng to be over for the year on May 26th. If you ask either one of our kids they would be able to give the the days and the hours probably. LOL Kristina will be getting several awards this year at school. One being perfect attendance and a award for her Super Stars (choir) participation. Justin has gotten the Marvelous Math Magician award twice now at his school. He is our whiz kid when it comes to math. Not sure where he gets that from. LOL Anyway, once school is over, I will not have a job. I am trying to find something for the summer, in between studying for my tests. Well i guess that is enough babbling for now. I am sure i will come up with more to say later.

      Saturday: Hi all that come and read my babble.  I got home around 7pm and soon discovered that the air conditioner had frozen up. I went and looked at the thermastat and it was registering 91. I called our landlord and friend Troy and he had Chuck, our other neighbor and friend come and look at it. Sure enough the air conditioner had frozen over and had to have some freon. Chuck happened to have what it needed and with in less than 20 minutes we had cool air! It took a while to get it cooled down but it finally went back to what its use to being on, 78 or so.  Sunday: As I was sitting in church on Sunday morning I began to reflect on how God has been taking care of us particularly while James was gone. Now I know he takes care of us everyday. But I could really feel his protection over us the past couple of days while James was out of town. Just because of all that transpired: almost getting a ticket, having a fire out in the parking lot at Walmart,(thankful that James' car was on the OPPOSITE end of the parking lot), air conditioner getting fixed so promptly.  I was also able to have Sunday off to go get James from the airport instead of having to find someone to go get him. So it was nice to have a boss at Walmart that was understanding and willing to switch my schedule to accomodate me. I think since i am in training that is one reason it was so easy cause i am not actually scheduled to be on the floor just yet. But i am still thankful that i was able to get my hubby. :) Monday: I go in to work at 3 today and am fixing my family a big breakfast, (for those who will eat it).  James is out walking as i write this. Will write more later i am sure.

      Well I started working for the Super Walmart that is about 5 miles down from us on Wens. the 26th of May. I went down there for an interview on Tuesday and was hired the same day! Talk about fast! lol On Thursday I took James to the airport to drop him off. I then went over to the school to talk to Justin's teacher and as I looked down on the seat, there was James' PDA. Well I went inside the school and used their phone to call him. Went straight back to the airport to give him his PDA before he left. He can't do anything without his "brain" as he calls it. It also had his credit card and money in it. hehe Well then i went to talk to Justin's teacher and to get his coat he left. It was teachers work day. SO i got to talk to her at length. It was a good conversation and I wished i could have stayed longer. I got a couple of treasures for Justin(worksheets and a container of Mealworms which turn into beatles). She also gave him a journal to use to write about the Mealworms. Well he has faithfully written in that book since he got it. I have to admit at first it sounded YUCKY but watching them develop has been quite facinating. hehe Well then i rushed home to get ready to go to work. I was suppose to be there by 12. I got changed and headed out the door. I have been using James car since he was gone. Boy that car can go. I was just a driving and drinking Slimfast cause i did not have time to grab a bite to eat. Next thing i know there was a police car trying to get in my lane behind me. I was sitting at the light watching through my rear view mirror. Then he got in my lane behind me and put on his lights...OOPS!! So i pulled up into a parking lot. He came around and we did the see your drivers license and registration routine. He came back and said Mrs. Moffitt do you know why i pulled you over. I said "Well, I am not sure but I am using my husband's car and I just got new shoes. So i might have been speeding." He said "Yes, you were going 57 in a 45". I am just going to give you a warning but if it had been a ticket it would have been 180 dollars and 4 points off your driving record. So now when i go on that street and am in James' car, I use the cruise control and only drive 45. Lesson learned.   Now on to Walmart i go....  Training has been fun! Getting to meet new people that have just started working there as well and the customers at Wallyworld. Yesterday as I was helping to MAN the Sidewalk Sale they were having. A lady came up to us all excited and said "There is a truck on fire over there" We all looked and sure enough there was some smoke and I could see a small flame coming from underneath the truck. I went inside and told a Customer Service Manager and she called the Fire Department. It took them about 15 min. to get to us by the time she had called. The flames were getting higher. Well of course a crowd began to form to watch all the excitement. What baffled me was that some people were standing like only a few feet away from the truck that was in flames. I was thinking... HELLO PEOPLE..FIRE, GAS, EXPLOSION!! LOL As people were going by you could smell something burning..well this one little boy said, "Where's the Bar-B-Que?"  I thought that was so funny!  I was all over the place this day, they had me bagging groceries and taking some out to people's cars. I did some cashiering and I also got on the computer for their Computer Based Learning. I go in today at 11 so I can't wait to see what is in store for me today.   While James is in Houston:  Last night Kristina had her sleepover. This was for her Birthday(May 4th) and for the End of the Year. She had 5 girls over ranging in age from 11 to 13. And then there was JUSTIN. LOL Poor baby was surrounded by Estrogen.  When I got home I was bombarded by everyone being hungry. lol Kristina had already fixed the meat for the tacos and uh...TRIED to make cheese dip on the stove. They ate it anyway. lol They also had Burritos, and tostitos. I never have seen girls eat so much. About 3 hours later they were coming in for a midnight snack. lol Then I was going to take the dogs out at 4am and there they were again...EATTING! lol I am not sure when they actually crashed. Some went to bed earlier..but there were some, including Kristina who stayed up past 4am. lol OH to be young again and be able to stay up all night. Well guess thats it from Duck Ditch. Will write more later.

      Friday the 21st I turned 35, oh I mean 45...LOL Memory laps...I wish it was 35. I did not think of myself as being old until I told one of my students in a class I had on Thursday that I was going to be 45 on Friday. Actually I made her guess how old I was. hehe   She said "37" ..I said "I wish..No 45". She exclaimed, "Mrs M you are OLD"! LOL Well needless to say I came home depressed Thursday. I guess I opened myself up for that one. hehe Silly me...  Friday I had lots of errands to do which included getting my license renewed. For anyone else this is like NO big DEAL! Well I was sweating the eye exam. The lady told me to look in the eye thingy(technical term) and I did. I read the two columns. Well supposedly there were THREE columns.  So she got a young kid to read it to verify that there were 2 or 3 columns. He said there were 2..Oh no there is the 3rd one. Well then she had me read it with my left eye instead. Somehow by God's grace I read what she wanted me to read and passed the test. hehe. So I am good for another 5 years. My license is good for 10 years but at the 5 year you have to submit an eye exam or come in and take an eye exam. Lord help me when that comes! lol   This weekend was the Women of Faith Conference. It was held at the Charleston coliseum(sp). It was great! Seeing 8,000 women in the same place at the same time and praising God! Talk about the power of prayers. There were several speakers that stood out from the rest..Sheila Walsh sang as well as gave her testimony. It was really awesome and I felt like she was talking to me. She made a comment about how you could know someone for years but not know when they are really hurting inside. We all put on masks where no one sees the real us. But God sees us when we are hurting and he is always there with his perfect will at the perfect time. Kathy Troccoli was there and sang and was awesome. She is one of those singers I wish I could sound like if I could sing. LOL She is not married and is now 40. She is quite content being single. God has used her in an awesome way. (can you tell that it was all just AWESOME!!) LOL She can belt it out and also hit the high notes. She did some fun songs that are from the 70's and 80's. She also has a new Worship CD out. She said that after 23 years she finally decided to put out a Worship CD of her favorites.  Also Nicole Johnson, who is a dramatist was there. She did several skits that hit home as well.  What was funny was at the end trying to get out of the parking lot with all THOSE women driving...you could only imagine what the police officers were saying as they were directing traffic! LOL All in all it was a terrific weekend. Our ladies at our church got to go for free, all because we volunteered to be in the prayer room for an hour and a half during the conference. Just to be available to pray with anyone that wants it. I look forward to next year!

      The other day when I was coming home from work I was pulled over again by Goose Creek Police. I thought OH GREAT now what? Well turns out that my light for my llcense plate was not working. So the female officer kindly gave me a VERBAL WARNING. This has to make an all time record, I have gotten pulled over TWICE in one week. LOL The next day i went out and got the bulb from Autozone and they got the light to work so my license plate will show up at night. The pack of two bulbs cost me not even 4.00, where as a ticket according to the officer would have come to about $280.00. James thinks she stretched it about how much a ticket would be. hehe I was not going to chance getting a ticket just to find out how much the fine would be.  Well, I have now been with Walmart for a full week. I have seen all sorts of people come in and out of Wallyworld. (as James and I love to call it) I have also seen lots of people that i know about a half a dozen kids from the school i use to substitute at, and several people from church.   It is always an adventure there. Yesterday I was in the express lane checking out people for 20 items or less. This was the first day that i was on the register by myself. I had MORE people come up that had more than 20 items but figure little items are better than bigger ones i guess. lol Today I was at a regular checkout area and I had a constant stream of people waiting in line to be taken care of. Thankfully I had some really nice customers that were patient as i tried to coordinate putting the stuff in the bags and scanning the items. I think some people expect the cashier to do ALL the work. ON the bottom of the turn table it states: Please help the cashier by taking your bags and placing them in the cart. (well maybe not that exact wording but something like that). Some people wait till the very end to do it, and I am running out of a place to put their stuff. UGHHH!! Ok, venting over...I know it will get better once i get the hang of it all. I have one more day of work and I am off on Saturday. YEAH!!  I was listening to Focus on the Family on the way to work today and heard something rather alarming that legislation is trying to pass the Hate Crimes bill where it would be illegal to make any kind of comment about Gays/Lesbians or same sex marriage. There is already a bill passed in Canada and Focus on the Family and Dr. Laura can not have any derogatory statements on their programs or they will not air them. It is getting to the point where we will not be able to have any type of RIGHTS as Christians to say what the Bible says about sanctity (sp) of marriage. Well guess it is time to start writing to our Congressmen/women and let them know what we think.

      Well I got the kids settled into the library reading program this past week. That was a major accomplishment. I have been studying for my initial certificate test. I take the test on this coming up Saturday the 12th. I have been studying when i ever get a break at work or on my lunch hour. Since i started working at Wallyworld I have been dreaming about Scanning items in my sleep. lol Once i tried to scan Sammy(our dog). lol  Then i realized that i was trying to put him into my dream. I have been on a register since last Tuesday i guess it was. I think I have been getting better on coordinating the scanning and bagging. I have fun talking to the customers and seeing all the little ones that come around.  One lady that came through the line had 3 kids under 5. She looked really stressed out. I tried to encourage her and let her know that it DOES get better as they get older. lol  Not much else has been going on besides work. I will be glad when i have taken my test and it is behind me!

      Well I finally took my test on Saturday. Now i have to wait 4 weeks for the results to see if i past them. I know that even if i do not pass I can still retake the test when i am ready or just continue to substitute this next year as well as have my Walmart job. That is not what i want but at least i know i have some options.  In the meantime i continue to work at Walmart part-time. I had today off and it was nice to be able to sleep late. Tomorrow is a different story. I have to get the kids up early to take them to the dentist and get home to drop them off in time for me to go to work at 1:00pm. I am hoping to go to the library so i can get some more DVD's. Cheap way of watching some DVD's is getting them from the library and you get to keep them for 2 weeks at a time. Kids are so excited about Happy Days camp that is coming up. The month before camp and the month after camp are the most exciting around here. hehe    The anticipation of what is to happen the month before and then the month after they tell us ALLLLL about it! LOL

      Well i feel like its a dogs world sometimes. hehe   I woke up this morning around 5ish cause Sammy our now 1 yr old puppy wants to go outside and check out the neighborhood. UGHH!! Once i took him out i could not sleep so decided to get on the computer and check email and play my Majohongg.   This past week was the pits at work. Well actually only Friday night was the pits otherwise it has not been that bad so far. Friday was the worst. I had two really rude customers. It did not matter to them that i had just started there. I felt very inadequate that night. I think Satan was having a field day that night. He was making me feel unworthy of everything and as you all know thats not the case. When you are born of the blood of Christ you are a KING'S KID. Nothing can change that! You were already bought with a price.

      Well here it is the 4th of July already. June flew by and before you know it will be time to get ready for school again. I received my Substitute Teacher identification card from Charleston County the other day. SO I am set up to substitute for them this coming year. I should get one from Berkeley County as well. I am still working at Wallyworld part-time and manage to get in about 30 hours a week. Right now i am working usually from 4 or 5pm until 10:30 to 11pm. I usually get Wens and Thursday off.  This morning we dropped the kids off at the Clarion Hotel in North Charleston, where the Charleston Police Department has a bus they use to take the kids up Camp Bob Cooper which Happy Days has their camp every year. It was the first time we have ever had them take the bus. I was happy to hear that it was a NEW bus they had gotten this past year. I know the kids will have a blast as they do every year. James and I both have to work tonight until 11.  I should be hearing if i passed my test for the Praxis II on July 12th. I sure will be glad to hear if its a yeah or a nah. The waiting is driving me crazy! Guess thats it for now.

      Talk about a sigh of relief. YES!!! I finally got the news last night when i went to the mailbox on my way home from work. I checked it before i went home. Sure enough I passed both of the tests for Special Ed. Core Knowledge and for Emotional Disorders. Now i have to send out some forms to my previous employers where I have taught and get them to send me the forms back completed. Once that is done I can send my application packet in and my 75.00 and wait another 6 weeks. I already qualify academically so its just a matter of time as to when i would get my Critical Needs Certificate. Once I get that in my hands then i can apply to any of the school districts ( that have openings having to do with ED classrooms) and start interviewing. School is fixing to start in a couple of weeks. I know i will not have my classroom at the beginning of the year but I know that it will soon happen! In the meantime I work at Wallyworld and once school starts maybe substitute a couple of days a week. I am not giving up my Wallyworld job until i absolutely have to. Yesterday I was talking to one of my customers, turns out they homeschool. I thought it was so cool. I kinda figured it out when she said that her daughters had their OWN BUSINESS. They even have a checking account with their mom for the business. One of the girls who is the same age as Kristina (12) had an ID that she got at the DMV. I was really impressed. Their business is to raise Beagle puppies and to sell them. Another clue that i noticed when i was checking her out. She bought Spanish workbooks and a Language workbook. I asked "What school do your girls go to". She said..."We homeschool!" Anyway, we had a great conversation about how people always talk about LACK of Socialization among Homeschoolers. Which is simply NOT true! LOL Kids that have been homeschooled (like ours) or those that are being homeschooled have more social skills than any Public school child i know. They know how to interact respectfully with adults and how to play or interact with younger kids. They have a wide spectrum of experience compared to the Public School child.  I am thankful that we were able to homeschool our kids as long as we were. It was the best thing we could have done for Jessica while she was here on earth with us. She did not have to EXPERIENCE public school and all that it involves when you are a special needs child. As you can tell one of my pet peeves is the argument about socialization among PS vs. HS. Well wish i could write more but its about time to get ready to face the wonderful world of WALLY WORLD. lol &nbsp;

      Houston, we have a problem.  Specifically with Blogger.com.  I am using Blogger.com because Chris Pirillo of Lockergnome gave a raving review of how wonderful Blogger.com is.   WAS ??  I am not slamming Blogger or Chris Pirillo because I realize that technology sometimes just does not cooperate.  It has been a bit frustrating however to NOT be able to use this service now that I am totally sold out to it.  Hopefully for Blogger (and my frustration level) things will even out and the service interruptions will begin to subside.  Having extensive experience in the IT Network Management and support I KNOW that technolgoy does not work "automagically".  A LOT of work and planning goes behind something like Lockergnome, Blogger and of course Jesus Connect.   :)  I have been a very avid reader of Chris Pirillo's Tech ezines for the last several years.  Chris has a way of making technology easy to understand.  Chris is a very bright individual and his writing style allows you to learn something new as well as get a chuckle at the same time. Thanks Chris !  Rant mode off....

      I checked my hotmail account today.  Had a message from member services telling me to either reduce the size of my email account or purchase more space.   They only give you 2 mb of space to begin with.     I found out that my BULK email folder at 999 DUPLICATE messages from SPAM. All the commercial spam is sent there automatically by Hotmail.  That means that they allow SPAM to fill up your email folder intentionally so they can sell you more space for MORE SPAM......  It is bad enough that they force you to have a MSN id to use any of their services on the Internet.  Then they allow something to happen so that you have to pay them for more abuse.   Good grief.   Now, that is customer service.....  NOT

      I was reminded today of how powerful relationships are.  Sometimes they can be bittersweet no matter how intimate it is.  God sometimes works through our relationships with other people to reveal his truth in us in our every day lives.  Knowing WHO God is does not help us to understand how to apply His principles to every day living in a practical way.    If you have ever had a friend let you down you know what I mean.  The closer that friend is and the more vulnerable you allowed yourself to be the worse the pain is when that person lets you down or hurts you.  I had to laugh at myself today because I described someone as a bottom feeder.  The situation was harmless and no one really got harmed.   A birthday cake  was purchased with minimal expense and effort with the expectation that the person would ACT like they atleast appreciated the effort.  This person is part of a group of folks that choose to celebrate their respective birthdays with a cake and song and some fellowship.  This person decides to take the day off from work without saying a word KNOWING that I was out buying the cake and making sure that it would arrive for their enjoyment.     I am reminded of the fact that their are consequences for my actions , no matter how insignificant the situation is.  How many times have I let someone down or broken a promise?  Was I the bottom feeder at that moment?  You bet I was.   I thank God for His Holy Spirit who enlightens me and convicts me of senseless mindless acts of carelessness and harshly spoken words or deeds undone.  I thank God that the power of the Holy Spirit inside of me drives me to desire a life of integrity and honor.   It is so easy to be selfish and seek out our own needs and desires forsaking those around us.  It is so easy to be indifferent and to allow our individual pain and struggles to anethesisize us against the needs of others.  The days of our lives can not be spent carelessly in the pursuit of making ourselves content and happy at the expense of others.   Entertainment value can not turn our faith in God into a spectator sport where we only engage our faith in God during Sunday morning when we have our pretty Christian face on for others to see.     Help me Jesus to not be a bottom feeder with regards to the humanity around me.  Help me to let YOU shine forth in all that I do and say.  Give me strength dear Lord in this area of my life.

      I feel sorry for insomniacs.  People who have chronic problems with getting the necessary rest to function during the day.  Scientific research shows that a person with sleep depravation is much more dangerous than a falling down drunk.  Our brain needs rest and if you dont get it you are not running on all cylinders.  I know how it feels because I apparently have a problem with sleeping.  If I sleep during the day for any amount of time I am able to stay up all night.  I guess by nature I am a night owl.  I spent quite a few years working 6 pm to 6 am and maybe my biological clock has never really adjusted.   I do my best thinking and creativity at 1 am.  How can that be?  Maybe I am just wired that way.  Now that I have to get up at 5 am so I can be at work at 6 am it causes a real problem.  At midnight I force myself to go to bed at 12:00 am and sometimes dont get to sleep until 1 am.   The year 2002 finds Grace Fellowship making some changes.  Each Wed evening service will be either a Youth Service, Lay/guest speaker, dinner/clean up, Praise and Worship and a business meeting every 5th wed of the year.   We discussed plans to do outreach for the purpose of growing the church.  That outreach includes starting in the church and getting existing members to invite friends and family.  Tom Glisson , our Pastor, agreed to allow a friend named Chuck to do some guest speaking on Wed evenings as well.  We are talking about moving the sound room from the attic down to the area where the nursery is and sharing some of that space.  We are talking about planning on funding sound equipment replacement.   That is desperately needed too.   Shannon has a line on some possible equipment that is not new but in almost new condition.   Hopefully an arrangement can be made so that we dont have to shell out a ton of cash up front.     Blogger seems to be a cool way to jot down quick mental drivel and post it for others to read immediately.  I hope that the server issues will be resolved soon and that the service that is being provided will stabilize.  I will be making changes to the look and feel as I learn how to do them but for now things will stay the same with the basic template that I am using.  I hope that you appreciate this and will come back often to read what Katy and I both will be writing here.

      I received this story in e-mail and liked it so much that I wanted to post it here on my blog for all to see.    My Traveling Companion By Edmund W. Boyle I've spent most of my career as a traveling salesman, and I know that there's nothing lonelier than a bunch of salesmen eating their meals in a motel coffee shop.  One year, my five-year-old daughter pressed a gift into my hands.  The wrapping paper was all twisted, and it was bound together into a shapeless mass by at least a mile of tape.  I gave her a big hug and sloppy kiss--the kind that all daddies give--and proceeded to unwrap the little package she had bestowed on me.  The contents hidden within felt kind of soft, and I was very careful not to cause any damage.  With excitement radiating from her face, little brown-eyed Jeanine stood attentively beside me in her too-small pajamas while I completed the process of unraveling my surprise.  A pair of black, beady eyes peeked out from their papery hiding place, then a yellow beak, a red bow tie, and orange feet.  It was a stuffed toy penguin that stood about five inches tall.  Attached to its right wing with still wet paste was a tiny, wooden sign, and a hand-painted declaration, "I Love My Dad!"  Beneath it was a hand-drawn heart, colored with crayon.  Tears welled up in my eyes and immediately I gave it a special place on my dresser.  Seldom did much time pass before I had to leave on another business trip. One morning when I was packing, I tossed the penguin in my suitcase.  That night when I called home, Jeanine was very upset that the penguin had disappeared.  "Honey, it's here with me," I explained.  "I brought it along."  After that day, she always helped me pack, and saw to it that the penguin went in along with my socks and shaving kit.  Many years have gone by since then, and that little penguin has traveled hundreds of thousands of miles all across America and over to Europe.  And we have made many friends along the way.  In Albuquerque, I checked into a hotel, dumped out my bag and dashed to a meeting.  When I returned, I found the bed turned down and the penguin propped up on the pillow.  In Boston, upon returning to my room one evening, somebody had perched it in an empty drinking glass on the nightstand--it never did stand up that well. The next morning I left it sitting in a chair. Again that night it was in the glass.  Once, at New York's Kennedy airport, a customs inspector coolly asked that I open my bag.  And right there, on top, was my little pal.  Holding it up, the agent quipped, "That's about the most valuable thing I have seen in all my years on the job.  Thank God we don't charge tax on love."  Late one night, after driving over a hundred miles from my previous hotel, I unpacked my luggage only to discover that the penguin was missing.  Frantically, I phoned the hotel.  The clerk was incredulous and a bit aloof. He laughed, saying it hadn't been reported.  Nonetheless, a half an hour later, he called back to say that my penguin had been found.  The time was late, but not that late.  I got back in my car and drove the couple of hours to retrieve my two-toned touring buddy, arriving near midnight.  The penguin was waiting at the front desk.  In the lobby, tired business travelers looked on at the reunion--I think with a touch of envy.  A few of them came out to shake my hand.  One man told me that he had even volunteered to deliver it to me the very next day.  Jeanine is in college now and I don't travel as much anymore.  The penguin spends most of its time sitting on my dresser--a reminder that love is the best traveling companion.  All those years on the road, it was the one thing I never left home without.

       What is so cool about technology is that there is NEVER a shortage of things to learn.  Some folks are addicted to many things, I am addicted to technology.  I call this mind candy.   Input, give me more input.   What I am writing here is probably senseless drivel but that is ok since I am changing the settings and learning how to customize the Blogger interface.   I am learning how to add Favorite Links and such as that.   Please bear with me as I stumble around in here.  You will also be happy to know that you will be able to see my wife Katy posting here as well.  I set her up as my team member and she will be able to post here as often as her heart desires.  That will give this blog some variety.   Cool stuff aye?

      The joys of technology is that there is ALWAYS something new to toy with.  I found out about this thanks to Chris Pirillo over at Lockergnome via his Windows Newsletter.  I am not sure what I am going to use this for.  I am very good at mindless drivel and I do fancy myself as somewhat of an amatuer writer so perhaps I will publish some of my thoughts.     Since this is my VERY FIRST BLOGGER entry I need to say something about me and my family. I live in Goose Creek SC with my family (Katy , Justin, Kristina).  I have a 15 yr old boy by the name of Jeremy in Houston Texas and a daughter (Jessica) that went to be with the Lord on August 5 of 2001.   I am just turned 40 and as I look back I am very blessed to have survived this last 40 years with no worse the wear both phyiscally or emotionally. In June 2000 Jessica Ann was diagnosed with cancer and we lived with that issue up until her passing on August 5th, 2001.   We are working on getting life back to normal.   I am the LAN Manager at the Naval Weapons Station in Charleston.  I manage 8 servers and approximately 125 nodes for the Public Works Commission.  This LAN is part of a larger MAN located on the Naval Weapons Station.  Year 2002 finds me and Katy looking forward to Weigh Down workshop.   Grace Fellowship Church is going to allow us to host this workshop at the church fellowship hall. We have had our first inquiry about this workshop.  We will need three or four more folks to get started officially.   Start date is the first part of February.  I seriously need to drop some weight and having experienced the loss of 35 lbs with this system back in 1999 I know it will be beneficial to my health.  I work from 6 am until 2:30 pm so that will allow me to do this in the evenings once per week.  I have become quite an avid student of bowling this last year.  Some of the folks at our church are in the habit of bowling every Sunday and I bowl on a league on the Naval Weapons Station each Monday evening.  Our bowling team is called Holy Rollers and currently we are in 3rd place.   Having used a straight ball for bowling I have decided that my average is just not going to improve.  I purchased a relaxed fingertip ball which will allow me to develop a hook for better control and more direct hits to the pocket which hopefully will increase my pin count and therefore my overall average.    Jesus Connect Ministries consumes a good portion of my time online.  The year 2002 finds us implementing a new version of Off World Colony which will fully automate a lot of functionality both on the server and for the administrators who run it on a daily basis.   That would be me.  Reynold, who is our founder and technical support guru, is going to chat with me on the 12th of this month and get me  up to speed.   Battle Plan Ministries has taken off like wildfire as Bill and Elly Berry head up the sexual addictions support message phorums.  Bill Berry is an elder at Central Church in Memphis Tenn and he has been able to get his church to engage what he is doing through BPM for a support group at his church helping men and women who are fighting with sexual addictions.  I am praying and trusting God to send us more Internet savy christians that can help us with the many phases of ministry here at Jesus Connect.  The year 2002 finds Katy and I going through the initial phases of grief after having lost a child to cancer.   We are on month number 5 without Jessica and I believe that we are just now getting to a point where we fully realize that she is gone.  We were invited to a weekend at Myrtle Beach on January 18th where we will be meeting with other parents who have lost children to cancer.  I am thinking that this will be good for us even though I am not really looking forward to it.  My wife is looking forward to a week away from Goose Creek and the kids.   More updates on this as things change.  I believe that I will be pointing all of my friends and family to my "Blogger"  page for updates from here on out.  This appears to be a way to share information without having to send out multiple e-mails to multiple e-mail addresses or distribution lists.  I can also write down my thoughts anywhere I am at and then just transfer them to my Blogger interface and publish them at will.     Be sure to come back often.  I drivel quite often.  I probably drivel way too much but you might get something out of what I say if only things to pray about.  I am hopeful that my thoughts and daily struggles will be a reflection of my faith in Christ as HE is the center and purpose of my life.   I am hopeful that as I voice my daily thoughts and struggles to this blog that someone will be encouraged and lifted up.   God is my refuge, my strength in time of trouble.  Without God I would be nothing.    James Moffitt January 9, 2002

      I went to post a praise report this morning in the Praise Report message phorum on Jesus Connect and noticed the following.    Prayer requests has 219 messages Praies Reports has 17 messages  What does that mean folks?  That means that we spend more time asking God for help than we spend in thanking HIM for what HE has already done.  We need to remember to be just as quick to thank HIM for the many blessings that we get no matter how small or common we think they are.   Think about this.  Here are things that we take for granted in America  Food Clothing roof over our heads  (some of us have VERY NICE roofs) vehicle(s) to drive jobs to go to running water electricity sewage service gas service cable or satellite tv radio stations trash pick up Internet computers Home entertainment  Church building to go to for services Church events in non hostile environment our health our families and being able to see them or talk to them via telephone US Postal Service Our governmental services that we whine about all the time  What am I forgetting here folks?  I am sure there is something that I forgot but you are getting the point.  We need to be just as excited about praising God as we are asking Him for assistance.  We need to feel the same amount of urgency to tell Abba Father and ourselves about GOOD stuff that happens in our lives.   Why do we horde all the cool stuff to ourselves and share all the junk in our lives?  Think about it for a second.     What are you thankful for?  You ask for prayer but you never report back about God's provision and answer to your prayer.  Yes, God sometimes says NO.  God tells us NO because sometimes HE teaches us through patience that we ask things foolishly.  We should be thankful that God does say no.  What IF we did get EVERYTHING that we do ask for?  That would be a very scary thing indeed.   Lets determine to have an attitude of gratitude in the year 2002 and increase our praise reports to match our prayer requests !  God bless

      This drivel is for Cybercitizens that would like some extra information or help with regards to traveling the corridors of Cybersafe safely and effectively.   Here are some applications that would make your computing experience on the Internet more enjoyable and add functionality to your Internet experience.    A. Make sure that you learn how to do a backup of any data on your hard drive.   Data includes but is not limited to MS Office documents that you might create such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access, Publisher etc etc.  Any application that you use that saves data should have that data backed up.  I HIGHLY recommend that you load your Operating System (Windows 95,98,ME, 2000, XP whatever) on C drive (boot partition) and put your data on D drive (different partition).  That way if you install a piece of software that hoses up your OS where the computer wont boot you have not lost your data.  You can then reinstall your OS and your data will be untouched.    B. Make sure you have a good anti virus application that does real time file scanning as well as E-mail screening.   I have used Norton Anti Virus for many years and believe it is one of the best.   McAfee has a good product as well. If you go to http://www.grisoft.com you can download a FREE anti virus program for home users that is very good too. Viruses can destroy data , mess up your Operating system on your computer and propogate itself from your computer to other people on the Internet via your Email program IF you are using Outlook or Outlook Express.  Computer Viruses also WASTE OUR TIME.  The time spent on virus prevention and fixing the issues once a virus does get through costs companies of all sizes billions of dollars per year.      C. Make sure that you run "Windows Update"  on a weekly basis to keep your computer software environment current. Click on Start and then go all the way to the top until you see Windows Update.  Download and install any CRITICAL updates that Microsoft shows you.   Microsoft products are full of security bugs that must be fixed and they seem to release patches all the time for the bugs in their software.   D.  Make sure that if you are on the Internet a lot or have a cable modem or dsl connection (high speed) to the Internet to have a personal firewall.   Zonealarm is one of the best software firewalls on the market and there is a free version for home users.  You can download this by going to http://www.zonealarm.com .  Firewall software keeps people out of your computer.  It is sort of like a computer gate.  It keeps your stuff on your computer on your computer and keeps hackers and snoops from the outside out of your computer.    The BEST solution for a personal firewall for folks that have Comcast @Home or Road Runner or another Cable Internet provider is to go out and purchase a router/switch/firewall combination.   Doing this requires a little bit of courage and networking know how. If you are not familiar with how to set up a basic peer to peer home network connected to the Internet then  you would have to find someone locally that can help you.   I recently went out and purchased a Linksys Router/Switch/Firewall.  I plugged my cable modem into one port and then I plugged in all of my computers (2 at the moment) into the switch side of the device.  I configured my static IP address that Comcast @home provided me to my router which in turn acts as a DHCP server for my internal private network.  Routers are virtual gates that shuffle data packets from one network to the other and keeps people OUT of networks that they do not belong in.   I access the Internet through my Router/Switch and the firewall KEEPS everyone out.   The device is configured through a web browser interface which makes it very nice.     E.  If someone sends you an e-mail stating that "thus and so" is an e-mail virus and instructs you to do something then please DO NOT DO ANYTHING.   There are a lot of virus HOAXES floating around on the Internet where folks are passing along every rumor they can find to everyone in their email address book.   Go to http://securityresponse.symantec.com/ for the latest security and virus threats on the Internet.   I have over 12 years of IT (Information Technology ) experience and this site is the one I use.  :)     F.  In order to talk to me via audio you will need the following products installed on your computer       1.  Microphone, speakers and soundcard on your computer.  You probably have these things already     2. A software application that allows voice chat such as Yahoo Instant Messenger or PalTalk or Netmeeting      3. Go to http://www.yahoo.com or http://www.paltalk.com to download either of these Instant Messenger     programs and install them.  Once you do that you can run the audio wizzard to configure your audio settings    Like I said earlier I have 12+ years of experience in Information Technology.  I am currently a  LAN Manager at the Public Works Commission at the Naval Weapons Station in Charleston.   I am a contractor working for the Navy and I help take care of one of the Local Area Networks that has 150 computer users and 8 file/print servers.  I live and breath techology in other words.  :)  If you go to http://jesus-connect.net/world/filebase/useful_tools.htm you will see that I have uploaded some useful tools (software programs) that you will find handy for computing on the Internet.  If you feel that there are some other tools that are missing from this new archive please email me at jcmoffitt@jcmoffitt.com and let me know.  I will find what you are looking for and upload it soon.

      As you get to know James Moffitt you will realize that you will be exposed to the many "personas" of me, I and myself.  Some days you might come to my web log and find myself in a full fledged conversation with myself fully not expecting anyone else to be here.   That is OK....  My doctor said I would be fine.  He just did not say when.   hahahahahahaha.  For those of you that REALLY KNOW me you understand the story that goes along with that statement.    The cool thing about blogging or having the ability to maintain a weblog is that when you forget to blather about a point or two you can just pick up where you left off and bore folks to death with a new blog.   :) It also helps to give me something to do while the rest of my family, birds, fish, cats and doggie are still fast asleep.   Here are the different sides to James Moffitt  A. Personal Ministry for Christ.  I spend a LOT of time in ministry to others through Jesus Connect Ministries online and in personal ministry through activities at church which include helping out occasionally with pulpit ministry,  Audio and Video production and maintenance, mimimal childrens ministry help and of course our bowling team on Sunday afternoons.   B. MR. TECHNOLOGY....  I live and breath technology at an alarming rate.   Am I the sharpest pin in the pile with regards to technology?  I am sure that there are those out there in cyberspace and in the IT industry that are much sharper than I.  I have been in Information Technology now for approximately 12 years.  If your issue has anything to do with Intel based Microcomputers and the software and hardware that runs on them then I will probably be able to help you with it.  If you have questions about the Internet and the many programs that you can use to get what you need from the Web I am the man for the job.  I have about 7 years of Internet experience so I am an excellent resource for new cybercitizens.     C. WRITER and UNKNOWN Author.  :)  I fancy myself to be somewhat of a writer.   My wife calls me a master babbler which means that once I get started it is very difficult to shut me up.  I love to talk and I love to write.  I tend to write about either Christianity (my personal walk especially) OR Technology.  I have found that the Internet and the World Wide Web is an excellent way to share your mindless drivel with the global audience.     D.  DEEP THINKER.....   If you put me in a room full of social butterflies that are geniuses when it comes to the game Trivial Pursuit and superficial conversation I would last about 10 minutes before I find my escape route out of the room.  Put me in a situation where I am talking to one to five people and we can get beyond the surface in convesation and I thrive in that environment.  I am a REAL person that experiences REAL life in a REAL way and am always searching for REAL HOPE and REAL solutions to REAL PROBLEMS.  In my experience MOST folks are the same way.  I have found that my walk with Jesus Christ thus far has been my ONLY HOPE for most of the problems in my life.You will find my talking more often than not about my daily struggle to figure out and live those things that God shows me through my personal relationship to Him.

      Houston, I believe our problems have been resolved with regards to Blogger.com.  I am so happy to see that my frustration level over Blogger.com has been lessened.  That means that our friend EV is sleeping a little better as well.  EV is apparently the one man show who keeps Blogger.com alive.   I can relate to this since I work hand in hand with my friend Reynold over at Jesus Connect and keep what we are doing afloat every day.  You would be AMAZED at how much time, energy, talent and WORK goes into providing this kind of service to the cybercitizens of the world.   I forgot to say CASH didn' I??  I talk to folks all the time that are looking for FREE stuff off the Intenet both in regards to software but also services. People have this misconception that just because the World Wide Web makes cyberspace appear to be a cyber mall that everything should be either free or cheap.  The problem with that misconception is that everything that you see in cyberspace was created by a programmer and maintained by a web master or network administrator or sometimes all three of those folks working together.   That does not mention the servers that are used to host that service or product on the Internet and the costs of running those servers.   Dont get me wrong here.  I enjoy surfing the web like the next guy and if given a choice I would rather test out some shareware product that is much cheaper to purchase a license for before I shell out hundreds of bucks for a commercial product that might very well be over hyped.   The advantage to purchasing over hyped software from a commercial vendor is that you are going to possibly get better tech support and free upgrades for a year and with the shareware software that is out there you might not get fast response or upgrades.    EV, my hat goes off to you just as it does any other cyberspace citizen who provides a free service or product to us cybercitizens.   God bless you my friend.

       I took the plunge   Can you say Windows XP Professional?  Ok, how about Office XP Professional?  I took the plunge and upgraded my Gateway PIII 866 mhz from Windows 2000 Professional to Windows XP professional.  What the heck.  It is Friday night and Katy is out doing her weekly cropping.  Cropping, scrapping, scrap booking, whatever it is you call it.  It leaves me at home with the kids, the animals and the computer network.  It has been quite some time since I destroyed my computer and I figured with worse case scenario I had all weekend to rebuild the PC if I blew it up.  If you are like me you have heard nothing but horror stories about how pathetic XP device drivers are.  Between that and the automatic registration process which requires a LIVE Internet connection.  Before I got started this is what I did.   I believe that it must have helped me just a little bit.   I uninstalled Norton System Utilities , Norton Pcanywhere and a Symantec utility driver of some sort.  I also uinstalled about 15 software applications that I was not using anyway.  The first sign of trouble that I had was when the computer rebooted for the first time duing the installation phase.  I lost video for about 15 minutes while the rest of the installation took place.  I got nervous but I figured as long as I could hear the hard drive grinding and see the cd rom lighting up I was NOT about to interrupt the process.  I figured that I could call Gateway Tech support if necessary.  Luckily for me after the last reboot video came back looking good.  I installed Office XP and upgraded MS Office 2000 Professional using disk 1.  That upgraded everything and added Front Page.  I then ran the 2nd Office XP cd to add the media content off that cd and it managed to hose up my MS Office XP install.  Outlook 2002 went away.  Back to CD 1 and the reinstall which recovered everything automagically.   Go figure ???  The only thing that I did not like about the Office XP install is that Outlook 2002 or version 10. whatever made me re configure my message rules.  I had approximately 65 rules so I wound up deleting most of them and consolidating my folders in my personal .pst file into the Outlook pst file instead.   I then ran the Windows Upate and downloaded all the critical updates as well as several of the non critical device drivers.  NIC, Video and Logitech Video drivers were the winners.  Every device driver I downloaded and installed worked and gave me increased performance.  Thus far this experience has been a huge sucess !!  I must say that Microsoft (am I really going to say this...) did a BANG up job on how the interface looks.   Now I need to install Snorton Antivirus software and pray that I dont blow this otherwise good evening into plasma dust.  Snorton Anti Virus software can be a weeee bit termpermental.  More on that later.

       To read the entire article cut and paste the url below into your web browser   http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt/Devotion/wial.html                                                                                           Walking in Abundant life   Our life is but a vapor.  We are passing through this world to enter into eternity.  Eternity can be a scary thing especially if what it holds for us is uncertain.  Fear is usually fear of the unknown.  Fear can paralyze us and keep us from knowing joy, happiness and contentment with who we are and where we are in life.   Life is a gift and we believe as Christians that God is the giver of this life.  Some of us would further define God in the person of Jesus Christ.  The Bible outlines a plan that God has given us so that we can walk in Abundant Life.   Lets examine some of the scripture that shows us what the bible says about Life and Death.     John 10:9 "I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.  10 "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.  11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.   John 3:14 "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  15 "that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.  16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   John 4:14 "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."   John 5:24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.   John 7:14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.   James 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one;  14 but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.  15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.     The bible is our guide to life.  The bible is our source of originality.  The bible is our authority with regards to the beginning and end of life.  The bible is our guide to living a life of abundance through Christ Jesus our Lord.  Some folks believe that our existence was an accident and that we have evolved from being a cave man to a higher form of life.    I believe that each of us belongs to a global community called humanity.  I believe that God created man and that we are to worship Him.  I believe that God created us to enjoy those things that He has provided us with.  God created us and provided us with everything that we need in order to have abundant life.  I believe that God defines what our needs are through the pages of our bible.   I also believe that we have gotten our needs and wants messed up and our life has gotten out of balance.  I also believe that the evil of this present world has drawn some of us out and separated us from our full potential as Christians.     In an effort to pursue God we have set up different religions and religious denominations with unique definitions of behavior and religious requirements that are necessary in order to find God and have abundant life.    What does life consist of on a personal level?    Eating Sleeping Emotions Thought life Sexual needs Intellect Physiology Religion Personal hygiene Entertainment Education Sports Hobbies Children Work Relationships Perceptions   As Christians we have entered into a personal relationship with God through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I am not speaking of an emotional guilt or reflex that causes us to behave religiously.  I am talking about our coming face to face with God of the universe because He revealed His plan for us through the reading of His word or by listening to His word being delivered to you through a sermon, bible study or personal testimony of another believer.  When we become Disciples of Christ we move from one relationship into another.  The bible says that we either serve the devil or we serve God.  We have allegiance to either one or the other.  We make a commitment to either one or the other.  We cannot serve God and Satan at the same time.  We have to make a choice that will have eternal circumstances.

       Prisoner abuse (cough....)    Rant mode on....   I wonder if you can do different colors and fonts in our blogs?  I would love to highlight utter nonsense in RED, especially when RANT MODE IS ON.....  Cough....  Apparently some dear folks are WORRIED that we are aBuSiNg prisoners of war.  Cough.....  SAY DO WHAT ??  Imagine this scenario.  You hired terrorists to fly large airplanes into a large building in a third world country.  Something goes horribly wrong and the country you reside in is besieged by that countries armed forces and you are captured.  What do YOU suppose is going to happen to your SORRY HIDE now??  Lets see about taking a trip down memory lane to Viet Nam.   Yikes.  Remember the horror stories about the POW camps there?  I believe that most animal shelters treated cujo BETTER.     (Imagine me jumping up and down now)  I can not do this for long since I am no longer light as a feather BUT this sort of thing makes me hopping mad.  (The jumping has to stop folks, sorry)  (Deep Breath)  Does the Geneva Convention ONLY apply to Americans?  Give me a break......  Are we treating the prisoners in a humane fashion?  How dare we put shackles and hoods on people who put on tennis shoes laced with explosives.  I thank God this idiot was too STUPID to get the thing lit.  Did they FORGET how to put a fuse in it so HE could light it?  Oh DUH........  So, this guy is not the brightest bulb in the chandelier huh?  I VOTE that instead of us spending our TAX dollars to build more prisons for POW's (not to mention the cost of taking care of them) that we fly the whole lot of them out to the Pacific ocean somewhere and dump them off on an uninhabited island.  Provide them with a shovel, hoe and a bag of seed of some type.  Give each of them a parachute and send them on their way.  Heck, just to satisfy the flesh here why dont we drop the folks about 1 mile off shore and make them atleast swim the last mile since we did pay for the fuel to get them there and the gardening tools and seed.  If they cant swim maybe one of their terrorist friends will help them out.     RANT MODE OFF   Remember that this is MY personal opinion.  If you would like to share your opinion with me in personal e-mail FIRE away.  Just dont flame me for my opinion.  OK ?? :)

       Happily driveling on the web   I need to look up the definition for drivel since I like to use the word so much.....  According to the American Heritage ONLINE dictionary that Yahoo provides to us cybercitizens this is the official definition  VERB:Inflected forms: driveled or drivelled, driveling or drivelling, drivels or drivels INTRANSITIVE VERB:1. To slobber; drool. 2. To flow like spittle or saliva. 3. To talk stupidly or childishly. TRANSITIVE VERB:1. To allow to flow from the mouth. 2. To say (something) stupidly. NOUN:1. Saliva flowing from the mouth. 2. Stupid or senseless talk. ETYMOLOGY:Middle English drevelen, from Old English dreflian.OTHER FORMS:driv   eler NOUN  Yikes, I am not sure that I like to think of my literary prattling as drivel.  I wonder what blathering means.   Hang on......  (sounds of mouse clicks)  INTRANSITIVE VERB: Inflected forms: blathered, blathering, blathers To talk nonsensically. NOUN: Nonsensical talk. ETYMOLOGY: Old Norse bladhra. See bhl   - in Appendix I. OTHER FORMS: blath   erer NOUN   Ok, I am batting a thousand here folks......    I will have to leave it up to the silent majority (you) as to whether or not I drivel or blather.  Perhaps I do, perhaps I do not.  I guess that it all boils down to your personal perceptions and opinions of me and/or my errrrrrr  writing.   :)  No matter what you think of me or my online blog please do me a flavor.  If you see me posting the same STUFF twice in the same day click on the "e-mail me" link to the left and let me know to let up on the cybergas and I can go in and edit it and remove the stereophonic drivel that is not necessary.  If you see me making multiple typos or ridiculous spellin mestakez  then please let me know that too.  Tell me spazcificly what wordz are mizpelled and I will correctum.  Mini Tanks

       Driveling in Stereo , folks!!    Somebody please stop me.  I am blathering in stereo again.  You would think that if I post the same article twice that I would edit out the mistakes I made the first time.   My friend Nolan just told me that behind every good writer there is a good editor.  I guess I need to find an editor that will suffer through what I do for free.....   hahahahahaha  Any starving editors out there care to take my driveling on as a side line?  I promise that I will try to say something funny atleast once per year.  Ok, how about once per month?    Stay tuned for more drivel....

       Spiritual Awkening, when will it happen to the church?   I wrote this in response to a friend of mine who posted a message about spiritual decay in America.  This response speaks directly to those of us who call ourselves men of God.       A spiritual awakening will have to start with us. The men of our families , of our churhes, of our communities, of our hearts.     Until the men, who are supposed to be  leaders , in every facet of our lives decide to  pick up our cross  and  count the cost  to do God's will in our lives sin will prevail.  Lets look at this in a practical way since it is hard to define the affects of what our action would do on a bigger scale.    Imagine what would happen if you came home after work to find your mail box had been knocked down. We would be irritated and we would eventually put the mailbox back where it belongs. We would reinstall our mailbox where it once stood.  Imagine how angry you would get IF that same mailbox started to get knocked down 3 days out of 7 or 5 days out of 7 or even worse yet, every day of the week.  What lengths would we take to STOP this from happening?  Would we use cash to buy a more sturdy mailbox?  Would we put the wood or metal that supports the mailbox in concrete now? Would we hook up our video camera to a vcr and let it run all day to catch the perp who is doing this?  Would we get our neighbor to watch the mailbox and house to see what is happening?  The point is simple.  You would do everything within your power and reason to stop the destruction of your property.  What about bad things being done to your family.  What would you do if your wife or daughters were being sexually harrased or physically harmed?  You would do everything in your power to stop the person from continuing this action.  Why is it we will go to every length to protect our mailbox and our family members but when it comes to issues of morality and national integrity with regards to moral standards we allow them to be continually flushed down the toilet?  When the Victoria Secret commercials come on during prime time hours do we change the channel or turn off the TV or do we just sit there and watch?  What about soft porn that shows on the premium cable channels late at night.  When we are surfing the channels and find the smut do we automatically change the channel or are we drawn to it like a moth to a flame?  How many times will we get burned by the evil wickedness of this day and age before we understand what is happening to our world?  How can the integrity of our testimony of who Christ is to us continue to be destroyed while we choose to live and condone a lifestyle of moral decay all around us?    The answer to that question is simple.   We can NOT continue to destroy our testimony or witness for Christ .  The world around us is dependant upon us to be real about our faith and love for others and holiness and obedience to Gods word. We must quit living for today and start looking towards the future and things of eternal value.

       Back from Myrtle Beach South Carolina   Katy and I just got back from a weekend at Mrytle Beach SC.  We arrived at 4pm Friday afternoon and got back home today at 1pm.  We had a blast to say the least.   It appears that the Happy Days organization has a ministry both to children with cancer or other diseases but also to parents after the child passes on.  Happy Days and special events sponsors a weekend get away each year for parents.  There were 25 couples there. Katy and I and one other couple were the newbies in this fraternity of parents who have lost children to cancer. Jessica went to be with the Lord 5 months ago and this other couple lost their child on November 8 of last year.   Saturday was spent in grief counseling.  I have to say that while this was a difficult time for Katy and I it was necessary.  We learned that pain is a part of living but that misery is optional.  In other words we learned that while our pain is intense and our experience devestating there is life after loosing a loved one to cancer.  In theory we knew that already but it is hard to get beyond the pain and loss.  We learned that there were three couples here in Goose Creek that have been through the same thing.  That means that we have met some other folks that live in our area that understand exactly what we are going through and they might be able to help us through this during this next year.     Debbie Stevenson  who is the director and vision for Happy Days and Special events (aka Camp Happy Days) is an incredible woman with a special gift for reaching out to the lives of sick children and their parents and bringing happiness and laughter to difficult situations.   We had an opportunity to spend some one on one time with Debbie late last night and it was a neat experience just to hear her talk about her 20 years of growth in her organization and all the children and parents that she has had an opportunity to touch.  I believe that she said that she has over 200 families who have been affected by a child that has died by cancer.   Apparently a small portion of the parents take advantage of the activities that they sponsor.    Saturday morning after breakfast they had a financial counselor who spoke on the importance of getting our finances in order and then they broke up the females and males seperately into their own special support groups.   Our pastor, Tom Glisson and Mark Smith from Mcalistar and Smith funeral homes were the facilitators of the mens group.   Most of the men stated that they had never been to the couples retreat the first year after their child had died because the pain was just too intense and they did not want to deal with it.  Apparently I am one of the few that actually has done this that they know of.  I told them that I did not go because I was wanting to be there but because Katy had really been looking forward to being there.  Katy needed a break from the children  and seemed to enjoy herself.    After everyone finished breakfast John Evans , who is a motivational speaker, spoke to use about coping with grief and change in our environments. You can visit John's website at http://www.johnevansspeaker.com/.  I plan on purchasing his book online.  He is a VERY good speaker and blessed us with the things he had to say.  All things considered I am VERY glad that we made the effort to go on this trip.  We both needed a break and it was good to make another step in understanding the grief process and getting on with our lives as a family unit.   God bless

       Real TV seems to be a new found fad on network television.  Is LIFE not real enough for us as it is?  Yes, I like to watch SOME television shows. Television is a way of escape and relaxation for me.  You can find me eating my dinner in front of the idiot box more times than not.  I call the TV an idiot box in a funloving way because I feel that if we allow ourselves to be trapped into a couch potato mentality where we turn our minds off and let the garbage pour in unfiltered that it eventually will turn us into mindless idiots.    As a Christian I find myself compromising my faith with some of the things that I watch on television.  Network television has changed dramatically over the years and they are showing things to us on TV that would have NEVER been aired 20 years ago.  Nudity, homosexuality,  spouse abuse, child abuse, wanton violence and a host of other things have taken over the television set.  No, this is not a rant about how evil the television set is and how I feel that you should exorcise it out of your house because you are in damage of hell fire.  Television is a tool.  Most of us use television as a means of escape and to receive information and entertainment in our homes.  The television is not what is bad but the content is what causes the damage.  If we use this tool correctly it can ADD quality to our lives and if we use it mindlessly and allow everything that is there to overtake us it can change our worldview and it can damage us.  More on that in another babble session.  Lets get back to Real TV for a moment.  Hollywood has found that shock value sells. How much shock value can you cram into a 60 minute program with 25 minutes of commercials.  I was talking to a co worker the other day about my trying to figure out the purpose and reasoning behind Real TV.  Real TV is attempting to bring MORE shock value to the homes of America through our viewing of people subjecting themselves to things that would normally terrify them if they were to experience it.  Actors and actresses are getting in front of the camera and showing  us their inner most phobias and fears and doing things that most of us would never dream of.  Is it the money that they are getting paid or is this all just another act?    I heard someone say that Satan is going to use our technology to deceive us in a big way.  I am not talking about polluting our minds and keeping us off balance and away from the things that we should be doing.  I watched a movie once about how the earth was destroyed by computer technology (robots and war machines we created) and how the battle raged on and the machines were victorious and humanity lost. The machines created a false world that humanity was thrust into and no one knew about it because of how it was done.  I am wondering if the same thing is happening very subtly to us as a race.  I wonder if Real TV is just another step in the chain of events that is being used to lull us further and further away from our own personal realities where we have to make life changing choices about real life issues.    Wars and rumors of war, disease and pestilence are signs of the time when Christ could come back for His church.  Every generation has claimed that they were experiencing those things and that Jesus was certainly going to come back during their generation.  We have been saying that for 2000 years.  The bible says that we will not know the time and day when Jesus will come back for His church but we do know that we are to be watchful and waiting and ready upon His return.  Technology seems to be drawing us further and further from the reality of who God is in our lives.  Instant success, instant relationships, instant gratification seems to be our desire.  We are cloning sheep and someone has probably tried to clone a human being and we have just not heard about it yet. We are trying to become like God.  The creation is trying to be like the creator.   Why is REAL TV so attractive to us?  What need do we have that draws us to it?    Am I paranoid or are we being deceived into thinking that what the network television giants are pumping into our houses really is reality?   Where does our worldview come from?  Where do we receive information?  What sources of information do we use in order to formulate our worldview?  We live in a world of information overload.  Thanks to the worldwide web everything that you can imagine is being categorized and turned into a web page.  Indexes upon indexes upon indexes have been created where you can research almost anything you want on the world wide web.  Our worldview will determine what our choices are and our choices will determine what happens to us and what consequences we will have to live through.  Bad choices can cause us to live through a life time of consequences.  Instead of us focusing on another reality on our television sets maybe we should be tending to our own realities.  Escape is nice but it only lasts so long folks.     I would love to hear your feedback on this and any other article that I post on my web log.  Feel free to write to me at jcmoffitt@jcmoffitt.com with any comments or questions that you may have.  Blogger Pro is supposed to have the built in ability to allow live feedback and interaction but I do not see that functionality just yet.  In the future we might have some surveys to see what everyone else thinks about a particular subject.

       Disjointed Drivel   Today is Thursday and tomorrow will be the day that I fly to Canton Ohio to see my sister.  Tanya and I have lost that sibling connection over the years so it will be like visiting with a stranger that I will have to get to know all over again.  I doubt that I will have the time to really know who Tanya is but I will just have to make the best of the short weekend that I will spend in Ohio.  The forecast for Canton is snow.  Yeeeeeha...   I wonder if I can stuff some in my pockets and make it back here to Charleston BEFORE it melts.  It has been approximately 9 years since I have seen my sister.  So many things have transpired in our lives and we have a lot of catching up to do.  I guess that you could say that we had a pretty rough childhood emotionally speaking.  Our parents did the best they could with what they had but they went overboard with the discipline.  There are times that I look back at how hard they were and I can see how it has helped me during rough times in my life. There are also times where I can look back and see the damage that they did to me as well.    When Tanya left home she had a rebellious spirit and chose to enjoy her new found freedoms.  All of that is a long story and a bit too personal to share perhaps.  I will say that Tanya has gotten trapped into a downward spiraling madness called life.  I am praying that Tanya will come out of that tailspin before it is too late.  Tanya has made some personal life choices that I will respect but can not embrace.  I know that we had a rough upbringing and I can see how that has caused Tanya some problems in adult life but it is time to move past that.  It has been 22 years since childhood and now it is time to be an adult and make some solid choices that will have a positive impact instead of a negative one.  I am hoping to lovingly encourage Tanya to take a look at some of the choices that she has ahead of her from here on out.  I will pray that God will give me the wisdom as to what to say and when and how.  I will pray that God would touch her heart in such a way that she will be free from some of the garbage in her life and find a new found purpose that only God can give.  We have all made some bad choices in our lives and as we walk through the consequences of those decisions we hopefully become better and stronger people.  Sometimes the consequences damage us and we are never the same because of the choices we make.  We all know of folks in our families and our inner circle of people that we come into contact with that are suffering from bad choices.   We would all like to just make those things right again and take away the consequences.  We would like to think that while we are unable to fix everything in other people's lives that perhaps God would magically take away all the pain and suffering and we could just start over again.    The reality of living is that we are changing and being molded into the people we are becoming.  Life, learning and the pursuit of happiness never stops.  Going from this life into the life beyond will be affected by the choices we make in the here and now.  When we have left this world and our family is left behind here for a time what kind of legacy we leave behind is up to us.  My hope is that I leave behind a legacy that reflects of a person who is real and who desires to get the lessons of life learned and took the time to share those lessons with other people.  That is one of the reasons that I am doing this web log.  I want to share my life experiences in the hopes that it will benefit someone else.  In the grand scheme of things I am but one person.  In the opinion of a lot of people I may be insignificant but I know that the creator of this universe has a purpose for my life and He gives me that desire to be the best that I can be and to share it with others.  What good is a legacy if you do not share it along the way while you are still here?

       Introducing my wife   Hi honey, I am home......  Errrrr  , ok, maybe it IS still ONLY 6:46 am and I am in my cage here at the office.  Nevertheless I do feel at home in cyberspace so I guess that statement was not too far fetched.  I invited Katy to our blog as a team member because WE are ONE.  Katy and I are like peas and carrots.  One of our favorite movies in the whole wide world was where Tom Hanks stated that " Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. "  We can relate to that statement aye ?  Katy is not as blabbery as I can be BUT when she does have something to say you ought to read every word and hang on every sylabble.  :)  I am GLAD that Blogger FINALLY got the Team Invite function fixed again.  How long have I been inviting you here??  Katy has a degree from the University of Texas at Austin in Psychology and Child development.  Katy has extensive experience in teaching children of all ages and putting up with me.  :)  Katy loves her new found hobby called scrapping, genealogy and being an all around house mom.  Whatcha going to write about hon??  ok, nuff said....

       Windows XP Professional and Office XP update   Alrighty then.  Can we say HAVING FUN at the OK Coral ?  I thought that I would update my travels down XP udate lane for those of you that might be interested.    I took the time to submit my blog to MANY MANY search engines to widen my drivel horizons in cyberspace.  Right now I believe I have approximately 3 people that read this.  We MUST increase our readership.  I think......  The Office XP install went just fine EXCEPT for file location and load errors in Outlook 2002 (aka version 10).  When Outlook came up it had about 4 different .dll files it was thinking it was supposed to load and never found them.  Therefore it regurgitated while I hit the enter key 5 times.  After much fuss I finally figured out that the only way I was going to get rid of the software configuration nightmare was to log in as administrator on the local box and flush my user profile.  I did that AFTER uninstalling the application suite and cleaning out the registry for each file that was mentioned during the error process.  That did no good.  I even tried to wipe the application suite from my C drive and reinstall in D drive.  Office XP would NOT install to D drive no matter what I did.    Problem solved.  The only ugly part to this is that I lost all of my favorites and my Outlook Express e-mail.  Since I have all of it on my home network it is NO BIG DEAL.  The important thing is that everything is working correctly without errors.  :)

       I wrote this message to the LOOK list and thought I would add it here to my blog just in case there might be a man who is grieving the loss of a child.  I received an e-mail last night from an old friend who I used to work with in Atlanta Georgia.  She told me that she knew of what I was going through and because she did not know WHAT to say that she decided the best thing for her to do was to say nothing. I told my friend that there is nothing anyone can really say to make things better.  What can be said to change the reality of our loss?  What can be said to change the intensity of the pain or the void in our hearts that we feel after our child is gone?  Our lives are changed in the blinking of an eye and we are left with the task of picking up the pieces and rebuilding our lives.  I told my friend that the best thing that she could have done for me as a friend was to just be there.  Allow me to babble in her ear for a few minutes on whatever subject that I needed to babble about.  Dont expect me to make sense. Expect me to ramble.  Expect me to cry.  Expect me to get angry.  Expect me to be frustrated. Expect me to be suicidal at times.  Expect me to be despondant.  Just allow me to be me and realize that the pain is making me be a little bit weirder than normal.  For those of you that dont know me I am a little on the weird side anyway so , yes, this makes me a little more weird.    It has come to my knowledge that there are a lot of men just like me who have lost a child and need ways to express the emotions I listed above.   The world that we live in is not conducive to men sitting around blubbering like cry babies over the loss of a child.  The world we live in demands that we suck it up and be tough.  What would John Wayne say if he knew that we were crying about something like the loss of a child.  John Wayne would say that people die, get used to it and move on.  So what it is your child.  Dont you have more children that will take their place anyway?  The problem with that thinking is that Hollywood has warped our worldview and our parents raised us men thinking that crying and showing emotion is a sign of weakness.  I remember listening to my earthly father telling me to shut up and not cry even after some of his good old fashioned whuppins.  I was thinking at the time that it was silly for him to tell me not to cry when my butt hurt and my feelings were trashed.     So, with all of that said let me say this primarily to the men that might be lurking here. You are certainly not superman.  It is ok for you to have feelings of emptiness.  It is ok for you to be angry about the loss of your child.  It is ok for you to admit that you love your child and miss them.  It is ok for you to feel angry that God allowed them to go home with HIM earlier than you would have wanted.  It is ok for you to question God and ask him WHY.  It is ok to be depressed and despondant for days on end.  It is ok for you to want to sit back and let the world pass you by in hopes that this will all just turn out to be a big horrible dream.  One of the things that I am learning is that everyone handles grief differently.  I can see that between myself and my wife.    I am gathering a list of names and e-mail addresses of MEN who are interested in walking down this road together with me. We are all part of a horrible fellowship of parents who are grieving.  None of us want to be here but here we are.  What we do with this is up to us.  I believe that each of us have the ability and the life experiences to help one another out from time to time and I just want to do my part to help those of you that need an opportunity to open up and speak.    I am setting up an e-mail distribution list in Outlook with the names of men that I am aware of so that I can start to dialog with them.  I would recommend that each of you do that as well.  If you want the list that I have and want to be added to it then email me at jcmoffitt@jcmoffitt.com  Be sure to put ADD ME TO THE LIST or SEND ME THE MENS GRIEF LIST in the subject line.  I will set up a filter in my SpamKiller application not to delete your email.  We can discuss things in e-mail, here on LOOK and we can also set up a virtual community where we have our own private message board and I can host chat times where we can chat in real time.  I am also willing to talk with any of you men via the regular ole POTS line.  POTS stands for Public Operated Telephone System.  Write me a private email telling me you need to talk and when and I will give you a phone number to call.  I am also available via MSN Instant Messenger at jcmoffitt@hotmail.com, AOL IM as Friend4836.  So, if you are on IM and you want to add me to your contact list and chat do so.  If I am at work and too busy to chat I will ask you to hang on for a few moments or to send me an email.  I will get back to you.    Ok, nuff said about that.  Lets start talking men......  The Superbowl is over anyway.... :)  James Moffitt Jesus Connect Ministries http://www.jesus-connect.net jcmoffitt@jesus-connect.net

        Ding Dong the SPAM will DIE!!   If you traipse over to  urlLink   you can download a 30 day shareware version of Spam Killer.  I installed the application at  home and LOVE IT.  Here are the instructions I gave out to our Jesus Connect Help Desk phorum last night. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  If you are as sick of SPAM as I am check this application out. Here is what I have learned thus far.  A. allow the program to import your contact list into the "Friends List" B. set up all your e-mail accounts with appropriate user name, server names and passwords C. go into Friends List and cull out the ones that you dont want to come through automatically  D. go into your Email client and TURN OFF automatic checking.  Spam Killer automatically checks your pop3 server for new mail.  Spam Killer applies included "filters" to determine IF this is spam or not Spam Killer will ALWAYS allow any email address in your friends list Spam Killer deletes suspected spam off the pop3 server BUT saves the email to the Kill folder so you can restore it if you need to. Spam Killer allows you to create your own specific filters on the fly  You will have to MANUALLY check your e-mail from your E-mail client to get the e-mail off of the pop3 email server.   Spam Killer is shareware to be used for thirty days. If you like it, register it on their website for 29.95.  Enjoy !!

       Today's devotional from Unto the Hills with Billy Graham is entitled  Behind the clouds    This is the paragraph that I highlighted out of this devotional as it applies to my life.   " Many times I have sat on our rustic front porch and watched the clouds below.  I have thought of the clouds of discouragement and suffering that temporarily veil the sunlight of Gods love from us.  Many people live with a cloud hanging over their lives.  Some may be in hospital beds; others are suffering discouragement and bereavement.  A heavy cloud hangs over them."  I believe that would accurately describe where we are at.  We as in our family.  Katy and I are painfully aware of the passing of time with regards to our new angel in heaven.  Jessica has been gone now for five months.  As much as I might try and forget it I can not.  The memories are just too fresh.  The emotions are too raw and the memories too poignant to even put them to words.     James Moffitt Jesus Connect Ministries http://www.jesus-connect.net jcmoffitt@jesus-connect.net

         My sister lives in Canton Ohio.  I have not seen her in over 9 years and therefore I made a trip to Canton Ohio to visit with her.  I left last Friday night and came back on Sunday afternoon.   I arrived in Canton Ohio at approximately 10:30 pm where it was snowing and VERY cold.  I thought that I would enjoy seeing the snow until I had to endure renting a car from Hertz.  I would have never expected the twilight zone experience but it was there awaiting me to arrive.  I checked out the car while waiting for my baggage to arrive in baggage claim.  I showed the attendant the confirmation number from the print out I got from priceline.com.  The attendant then charges 169.00 to my Visa when I only had 164.00 available.  Unknown to me Hertz charges 40.00 above and beyond the actual charge anticipating that you will bring the car back a day late or without gasoline.  They only charge 4.54 per gallon if you forget to fill it.  That is reasonable aye?  I finally snag the car keys and my bag and head out into the snow.  I get to the car which is about 45 yards from the terminal and discover the key does not work.  No matter how I try the key it wont work.  I decided to try the car door and it was unlocked after all.  Did I just unlock it and not understand how it worked?  I dug out a piece of paper with regards to the car rental and had a question for the attendant so I locked my bag in the back seat and headed back to the terminal.  Snow is driving horizontal and it is about 25 degrees here.  After talking to the clueless attendant about the confirmation and how it was supposedly already charged to my VISA I soon find out that I will do better talking to the manager on Monday.  I head back out to the car to find that I can NOT open the vehicle.  Five trips to the terminal building and two hours of helping the Hertz maintenance man to break into the car I am finally on my way to my sisters house.    The visit with my sister was relatively uneventful and I was glad I was able to make the trip.  I was able to meet one of my nephews and his wife and children which was neat.  It was weird being called Uncle James and watching my sister being called Mom.   My sister apparently had a run in with a projection screen in Feb of 2001 and has been suffering from head injury related illnesses every since then.  Head aches and gran mal seizures are on the top of the list of ailments to pray about.

                                                                                                Walking in Abundant life     Our life is but a vapor.  We are passing through this world to enter into eternity.  Eternity can be a scary thing especially if what it holds for us is uncertain.  Fear is usually fear of the unknown.  Fear can paralyze us and keep us from knowing joy, happiness and contentment with who we are and where we are in life.   Life is a gift and we believe as Christians that God is the giver of this life.  Some of us would further define God in the person of Jesus Christ.  The Bible outlines a plan that God has given us so that we can walk in Abundant Life.   Lets examine some of the scripture that shows us what the bible says about Life and Death.      John 10:9 "I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.   10 "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.   11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.   John 3:14 "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  15 "that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.  16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   John 4:14 "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."   John 5:24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.   John 7:14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.   James 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one;  14 but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.  15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.   The bible is our guide to life.  The bible is our source of originality.  The bible is our authority with regards to the beginning and end of life.  The bible is our guide to living a life of abundance through Christ Jesus our Lord.  Some folks believe that our existence was an accident and that we have evolved from being a cave man to a higher form of life.    I believe that each of us belongs to a global community called humanity.  I believe that God created man and that we are to worship Him.  I believe that God created us to enjoy those things that He has provided us with.  God created us and provided us with everything that we need in order to have abundant life.  I believe that God defines what our needs are through the pages of our bible.   I also believe that we have gotten our needs and wants messed up and our life has gotten out of balance.  I also believe that the evil of this present world has drawn some of us out and separated us from our full potential as Christians.     In an effort to pursue God we have set up different religions and religious denominations with unique definitions of behavior and religious requirements that are necessary in order to find God and have abundant life.    What does life consist of on a personal level?    Eating Sleeping Emotions Thought life Sexual needs Intellect Physiology Religion Personal hygiene Entertainment Education Sports Hobbies Children Work Relationships Perceptions  As Christians we have entered into a personal relationship with God through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I am not speaking of an emotional guilt or reflex that causes us to behave religiously.  I am talking about our coming face to face with God of the universe because He revealed His plan for us through the reading of His word or by listening to His word being delivered to you through a sermon, bible study or personal testimony of another believer.  When we become Disciples of Christ we move from one relationship into another.  The bible says that we either serve the devil or we serve God.  We have allegiance to either one or the other.  We make a commitment to either one or the other.  We cannot serve God and Satan at the same time.  We have to make a choice that will have eternal circumstances.    Christianity is not a religious behavior but a way of life.  Our behavior does not define what Christianity is but our actions define how Christ has changed our lives from the inside out.   The difference between a religion vs. Christianity is a religion defines how we can become Holy enough to approach God while Christianity empowers us through the Holy Spirit to KNOW God on a personal basis and allows us to learn how to walk according to His will for our lives and our community.    Thanks to the Information Age we have more information available to us in real time than ever before.  Can you imagine that a world event sometimes took days, weeks or months to be reported to the rest of the global community?  Those were the days when we did not have tele-type, telephones, fax machines, computers, e-mail, satellite, pagers, or cellular communications.  How many of us know more about the bible and its doctrines than we know how to live our Christianity in a practical way?  Do we major in information gathering and minor in living the truth of Gods word?  Do we focus more on attending church, doing religious traditions, reading books about God, attend seminars than we do on learning how to live the life of a Christian?  If the answer were yes then I would believe that is the root cause for our failing to experience Abundant Life that Christ spoke of.    How many of us have the family bible sitting on our desk, end table or up on the shelf gathering dust?  The only time some of us open the bible is when the pastor or bible study teacher tells us to open it up and direct us to a chapter and verse.  Some of us treat our bibles just like we do the remote control for our TV sets.  We take out the remote from the package, put in fresh batteries and when we want to change the channel we punch the right buttons.  Has our Christianity turned into a series of bad commercials that we are frantically trying to flip through?  Are we hurriedly flipping through the abundant life that God has outlined in the pages of His word or are we taking time to absorb the information within the pages of His book?  We entered into a personal relationship with Christ, asked the Holy Spirit to enter into our hearts so we would have power on high and then we allow the cares of this world and the endless sin in our lives to drain the life right out of us.    If we do not feed our souls the word of God we will be like a ship without a rudder.  We will become like a ship without direction and no power.  The Holy Spirit within us will be quenched and stifled to the point that HE will be grieved.   The key to abundant life is a personal relationship with the God  (Jesus Christ) of our universe.  A relationship must be nourished and tended to on a daily basis.  If you are in a marriage relationship you understand how important it is to work at keeping that relationship healthy.  Relationships of all types require nurturing and that takes energy and focus.  Relationships take commitment and personal sacrifice.   The word of God, the power of prayer and the Holy Spirit and the people in Gods kingdom is what defines us as Christians.  Without those critical elements our faith would be powerless and useless.   The benefit of a relationship with Christ is abundant life, fulfillment and challenge.  God says in His word that He will write down our names in the Lambs book of Life and will allow us entrance to Heaven to worship Him for eternity.  We must choose to keep our commitment strong to which we are in the kingdom of God on a daily basis.   The bible says that we are to be in the world but not of the world.  Does that mean that we do not associate ourselves with people who do not subscribe to our faith in Christ?  Do we totally reject every single thing about our world and move into caves and become outcasts of society?  I believe that God wants us to be salt of the earth and the light of the world.  Our faith brings flavor and our life of integrity lights the way to the kingdom of God for all who will look.   Relationship evangelism is a key way in which we can get to know someone, show him or her that we care, live our life of faith in front of him or her without compromise and allow the power of the Holy Spirit to draw him or her to the kingdom.  We must learn how to love people and despise their sin.  We must despise their sin because we know that the consequences of sin is death.  We must learn how to show the love of God to people through mercy and compassion.   Chuck Swindoll stated in his book on Compassion that People do not care how much you know until you know how much you care.  Once upon a time I was zealous for God.  I was so zealous about telling people about the truth of Gods word that I sacrificed the love of God, compassion for people and mercy.  People need to know that God loves them.   People need to know that God is a God of love, mercy and compassion.  People need to know that God has given them a choice.  We must live our lives in such a way that people can clearly see their choices.    We must know HOW to LIVE out our faith in God in a real way for the world to see.  Our lives must be an open book so that our victories and defeats can reflect the power of God.  The following list will attempt to reflect some of our daily battles and some of our choices.     I recognize the benefits of growing in the knowledge of Gods word but I struggle in choosing to study Gods word.  I would rather watch TV or read a good book than study Gods word.   I want to be more like Christ in my thoughts and feelings but I find it difficult to get away from my old life habits and sin nature.  The old nature is too difficult to overcome sometimes.   I see a need to pursue God on a regular basis to grow our relationship but I tend to only seek Him when I am in trouble.   I find it difficult to make personal sacrifices that will benefit me in my Christian growth because it is so much easier to go along with the crowd.  My nature is to do what comes easiest to me instead of what is difficult.    I understand more about WHO God is to me but I am finding it difficult to translate His changes to me in a practical way.       I constantly find myself having to focus on my thought life and having to rebuke impure thoughts with regards to my fellow man.  I catch myself listening to others gossip and passing that information on through gossiping myself.    I have a problem with my temper and catch myself speaking sharply to my children or spouse.  I find myself sacrificing my relationships with people for the sake of pursuing personal wealth, status and power.   I find it difficult to reach out to others who are more needy than myself.  I catch myself focusing on my problems more often than not.  I find that it is easier to be critical of my pastor and the church I attend instead of taking the time to pray for the people and situations.   My addictions to food, sex, drink or drugs have robbed me of joy, peace and contentment.    As you can see this list could go on forever.  Now that we have scratched the surface with regards to some of the things that are affecting our ability to walk in abundant life lets look at some positive things that we can do in order to make wrong things right.  The problem with our lack of balance with regards to living out our faith is very similar to the problems that we have in our educational system of today.  Why are our schools releasing young people into society without the necessary skills that will enable them to be productive members of society?      A.Our children do not have a firm grasp on the fundamental basics, which include reading, writing and arithmetic.  Without the basic learning blocks how can we expect them to have the necessary skills for higher learning?  B.Our children attend battle zones for schools.  When we attended school our issues were talking in class and chewing gum and fist fights in the parking lot.  Our children have to endure an environment filled with violence because of drug abuse and kids carrying guns to school.    C.Our children are not receiving discipline at home and the school systems are forced to do what the parents are supposed to be doing to begin with.  How can teachers do what they are gifted to do when the children are not focused enough to do the work?  Living in an instantaneous society is not conducive to the kids taking the time to learn but would rather goof off and play.    D.Our children are subjected to teachers who are not committed to teaching.  It is hard to get an education when school systems are not willing to provide a work environment that rewards teachers for the sacrifices they make.  That drives teachers out of the classroom into other occupations that pay more.   Now lets look at how people have gotten out of balance with regards to experiencing Abundant Life that God has for us.    We have not learned the basics of our faith.    Scripture memorization, regular bible study and becoming knowledgeable about basic bible doctrine have left us weak and vulnerable to our enemy who is Satan.   The bible says this about our enemy.  Peter I 5:7 Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you.  8 Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour.  9 Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experience of suffering is required of your brotherhood throughout the world.  10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you.   We have forgotten that Satan is the enemy of God.  That means that YOU are the enemy of God.  Satan will drag you into the pits of Hell with him IF you allow yourself to be taken.  Satan is the great deceiver and has the ability to deceive people IF they are not preparing their minds with the truth of Gods word.  The bible says in the book of Hosea.   Hosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.   This is what the bible says about the IMPORTANCE of reading Gods word.   Hebrews 4:11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.  12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  Timothy II 2:14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.  15 Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.  16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.   We carelessly place ourselves in the middle of the minefields of life and wonder why we get our toes blown off.    We forget whom we belong to and we continue to act as if nothing has changed when we enter into a personal relationship with Christ.  We look to God as a puppet that we can manipulate when things go wrong but the rest of the time we leave Him on the shelf.  We entertain our minds and bodies with the cares of this world, which have no eternal meaning and lose out as we rush past the golden nuggets of a life filled with faithful obedience to Christ.  Our walk with Christ should be one of discipline, focus and diligence.   There is an old saying that says, Birds of a feather flock together.  We must learn how to associate ourselves with Kingdom Kids.  We need to seek out a good bible teaching church with people who are REAL about their relationship with God so that we can LEARN and GROW in our faith walk.  If we expect the power of God to be transferred into our lives and to give us REAL power so we can experience abundant life then we are going to have to place ourselves in the right environment for it to happen.    We run from discipline.    We live in an instant generation where we do not have to wait for anything.  We want it and we want it right now.  If you want something you do whatever you can to get it NOW.   Buy now and pay later is our motto.   In 2nd Corinthians we see the bible telling us therefore if any man be in Christ he is a NEW creation, old things pass away and all things become new.  We seem to think that our sinful nature is going to magically disappear and that we are going to completely and automatically bury our sin nature and that our NEW man (spirit man) is going to naturally spring forth.  We forget that there is a constant battle raging within our souls as the flesh competes with the power of the Holy Spirit that Christ places within us.  When we do something that we like we find out very quickly that we must discipline ourselves to learn HOW to get better at doing it.  If you like to bowl and you want to get better then you have to discipline yourself to learn HOW to approach the line and release that bowling ball in such a way that you can hit the head pin and knock down everything at once.  If you do not get it right then you will see that you are off balance and the ball will not hit the mark and then you will have to try it again.  We must determine to be disciplined in order to read Gods word and understand How to apply biblical principles to our lives.    We are powerless because we do not pray.    If you love someone you spend time with them and you talk with them and you share your heart with them.  You share your deepest secrets with them and you listen to what they have to say.  You learn how to become intimately involved in everything that they do and say.  Our relationship with God should be the primary relationship where we learn how to be intimate with regards to who we are in the kingdom of God and what God wants to share with us.  If you do not have quiet time where you can speak to God and LISTEN to what God says back to you then you will lack power in your life.  There is NO WAY that a professing Christian can overcome sin habits or addictions in their life if they are not willing to take the time to have intimate and regular conversations with God.  Only God can change you from the inside out.  Your pastor cannot do it.  Your spouse cannot do it.  Your children cannot do it.  Only GOD can change you into the image of WHO HE wants you to be.  God desires for you to have a CLOSE relationship so that HE can reveal who HE IS in the world around you.  You cannot get what God has to offer if you only talk to Him when you are desperate for your problems to be solved.    We are vulnerable because we separate ourselves from the body of Christ on a regular basis.   God designed relationships for a purpose other than for us to have an avenue to populate the planet. Have you ever asked a child who God is?  More often than not they will tell you His name is Jesus.  If you ask a child where God is they will probably put their hand over their hearts.   Children know that the kingdom of God resides in our hearts.  God made us to worship Him and he created us with a void in our hearts and souls that only He can fill.  The kingdom of God is all around us in the people who love Him and call Him the Lord of their lives.   No man is an island and we NEED to be around people who have the same faith beliefs that we do.  We need to be around people that think and feel and believe just like we do.  We draw strength and assurance from one another and we can help each other to be accountable for the integrity of our walk with Christ.    We need close personal relationships with other believers so that we can learn from one another as we share our victories and defeats.  This will require that we let down the walls of our hearts and be real with one another.  This will require that we commit to being a person that someone will be safe sharing their heart with.  So many folks have been burned and hurt because a careless tongue broke confidentiality.    We cannot experience Abundant Life that God intends for us to have when we fail to fully embrace the spiritual gifts that He has given us.   God gives us faith so that we can believe.  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  We can believe in who God is because HE gives us the spiritual ability to believe through faith.  Hebrews 11:6 says "But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."     Corinthians I 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.  2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.  3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.  4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.  5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.  6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.  7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.  8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;  9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;  10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:  11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.  12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.  13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.  14 For the body is not one member, but many.   Did you know that God has given you a spiritual gift?  Do you know what that gift is?  Have you ever been challenged to find out?  Do you think that you can be a part of Gods plan to reach the world for Christ or minister to the body of Christ around you without God equipping you for the task?  Spiritual gifts do several things.     Glorify God and His Kingdom  Minister to the needs of the world around you  Convict people of sin in their lives  Causes healing and restoration  Brings forth Gods word  Defeats Satan who is your enemy  Gives Abundant Life to those who use them   We sometimes experience failure and defeat because we need to allow God to develop the fruit of the spirit in our lives  How will people KNOW that we are Christians?  They will know us by our Love for one another, God and our spiritual fruit. Have you ever gotten zealous for God and gone off half cocked?  Our intentions are good and we mean well.  The only problem is we are not prepared for some of the battles and challenges of life because God is not finished with us yet.  Growing in grace and maturity takes time.  There is no substitute for Gods timing in our lives and the discipline to be obedient to His word.  Lets examine the fruit of the spirit according to what Gods word says.  Matthew 7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:   Galatians 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.  22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,  23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.  24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.  25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.     Do we have a right to judge whether or not someone is a true Christian? I would say a resounding no. Only God truly knows our hearts.  Do we have the ability or right to be fruit inspectors?  Yes, we can see how folks live their lives and if they are Disciples of Christ we will see evidence of this through the fruit that God will produce in their lives.  The following statements are Spiritual Confessions of Gods Abundant Life.  I got these from the back of one of the church handouts at Abundant Life Church in Houston Texas.    Please allow me to encourage you to embrace each one of these confessions.  These confessions are biblical in nature and God has provided them for us in His word so that we can be strengthened and encouraged in times of trouble.   Life is full of challenges.  Life is full of victory and defeat.  Life is full of pain and anguish.   Bad things can happen to good people as well as bad.   Our Joy of the Lord MUST be our strength and we can not allow the circumstances of this world to rob us of this joy or Abundant Life.     I am not under guilt or condemnation There is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus  Satan is a liar; I will not listen to His accusations  No weapon formed against me will prosper  I will confute every tongue rising against me in judgement  My mind is being renewed by the Word of God, I pull down strongholds  I cast down imaginings; I bring every thought captive to the obedience of Christ  I am accepted in the beloved  If God be for me, who can be against me?  Nothing can separate me from the Love of Christ  I am NOT a slave to SIN  I am a slave of God and a slave of Righteousness  I am delivered out of the Kingdom of darkness  I am now part of the Kingdom of God  I do not have to serve sin anymore  Sin no longer has dominion over me  Satan is defeated  The Son of God came into the world to destroy the works of the devil, No longer will he oppress me?  I defeat him by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of my testimony, loving not my life unto death.   I submit to God, I resist the devil and he will flee from me.  No temptation will overtake me that is not common to man.  God is faithful, he will not let me be tempted beyond my strength but with the temptation will also provide a way of escape that I may be able to endure it.   I will stand fast in the liberty with which Christ has made me free  Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty   The law of the Spirit of life in Jesus Christ has set me free from the law of sin and death.   I will reign as a king in life through Jesus Christ  I am strong, the word of God abides in me, and I have overcome the evil one.   I am more than a conqueror through Christ who loves me  I am an overcomer  I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me  Thanks be to God who gives me the victory through Jesus Christ my Lord  I give no place to fear in my life, the fear of man brings a snare, but perfect love casts out fear.  I sought the Lord and He heard me and delivered me from all my fears  The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear.  The Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid  God is my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble therefore I will not fear.  If I were still trying to please men, I should not be a servant of Jesus Christ  But I am a servant of the most high God.  I fear not, for he is with me.  I shall not be dismayed, for he is my God.  He will strengthen me, he will help me, he will uphold me  With his victorious right hand.  I am not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to those who believe  I am a minister of reconciliation  I am an ambassador for Christ  I received power when the Holy Spirit came upon me to be his witness  His word never returns void but always accomplishes the purpose for which he sent it  I am righteous, therefore, I am bold as a lion  He will never fail me nor forsake me, therefore, I can boldly say, The Lord is my Help, I shall not be afraid.  What can man do to me?     James Moffitt Jesus Connect Ministries http://www.jesus-connect.net jcmoffitt@jesus-connect.net

       Well, the jury is out and SPAM Killer is dead.  I ripped it out by the roots.  Is the application useless?  No, as a matter of fact it DOES block a LOT of spam.  Sadly enough I get so much of it that I spend more time configuring filters in Spam Killer than I do getting to read the e-mail I am interested in.  Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express both give you the ability to block junk e-mail even if it does not kill it at the server itself.  The moral of the story goes like this.  NEVER register your e-mail address with a SINGLE website if you do NOT want to be spammed.  Internet entrepenuers are shameless in their quest for the almighty dollar and if that means that they fill up your inbox with worthless drivel they will.  On the way back from getting luch today I had a guard ask me where Jesus was.  I did not figure this out later but they were talking about the license plate that I have on front of my Lincoln. It says Buckle up with Jesus.  I guess the guards were bored and thought they would have fun with me for a moment.  I made sure not to tell them that Jesus was in the trunk.  That would have cost me an hour at the security office with my car getting searched.  Our pastor lost a dear friend to cancer this last Friday and he headed up to Illinois to do the funeral.  Pastor Tom asked me to take his place at the pulpit this last weekend and it looks like I will be doing it again this Sunday after finding out that the engine in Pastor Tom's suburban.  When it rains, it pours. We need to pray for a good deal on a decent engine and a safe return for Pastor Tom as well as the situation with the family that lost their dad and husband.    I was hoping to set up a distribution list for dads who are grieving the loss of a child.  Thus far I have not gotten much response, if any.   Well, you are not going to believe this but I think I just ran out of something to drivel about.  Over and out !

       In 45 minutes I can say  "Ding Dong the Witch is dead".  That will mean that it is time to pack up and head to the house.  I will have burned another 8 hours here in my little techno cave here at work.  Isn't that special??  I spent time with the family at the flea market in Ladson this weekend.  We sold two Dale Earnhardt cars and NOT another thing.  We make just enough money to pay for our booth rental and not much else.  We were set up inside and I think that I now see the error of our ways.  We need to set up OUTSIDE where the throngs of people are scurrying about.  If we are outside we will be able to help seperate people from their money.   Sunday was spent listening to little ole me sing and preach for several hours.  Those poor people.  I am sure that they will be happy when Pastor Tom gets back in town.  I was able to lead the service due to Pastor Tom having a death in the family.  This will be tough on Pastor Tom because they were close.   The message on Sunday was "Christianity is not a spectator sport, running the race for God".  To God be the glory !!

       Life sometimes consists of walking one moment at a time and then one day at a time.  Learning how to be content with the here and now always seems to be at war with our expectations for the future.  We set ourselves up for failure when we compare our sucess with what appears to be the sucess of others.  We look at the lives of other people and are quick to make assesments of them after a brief glimpse of the outside.  First impressions can be dangerous.  If folks fit a predefined mold that the world gives us to model then those folks must have it all together.  If you wear the right clothes, weigh the right weight  , are the right height , drive the right kind of car, live in the right type of house in the right kind of neighborhood then you must be a sucess.  The problem with first impressions is that we only see what is on the outside.  We dont see the burdens and fears and hopes and dreams and pain that might be right under the surface.  All we see is what we can see through the limited perceptions of our own eyes.  We look at one another just like we look at God, through darkly shaded glasses.  We are familiar with the general shape and color and smells but when it comes to clarity things are just so fuzzy.    Our priorities are driven by what makes us happy and our priorities will utlimately define who and what we become.  Pursuit of happiness can last a lifetime and can lead to ruin.  The world yells at us that if it feels good do it.  The problem with that philosphy is that the world around us is filled with things that will satisfy our flesh until it gets bored.  How many boxes of chocolates do you need to eat before you get sick of it?  Our flesh desires to have variety.  Give me this, give me that.  Allow me to experience all that I can so that I can feel good.  Our happiness never quite reaches true joy and peace.  The happiness that the world offers us will never satisfy our need for peace and contentment and fullfillment.   Our purpose to be happy and content will never be complete without God.    Living in the meantime means that we must find the hope.  Life is full of disappointment, heart ache, frustrations, trials and tribulations and temptations at every corner.  What is at the end of the tunnel ?  Through the pain , onward to battle and victory.  Do we have a choice?  We either stand still and subject ourselves to the pain and anguish that the world will inflict upon us or we choose to acknowledge the pain and choose to enter into the battle of life and figure out how to become victorious.   A life without purpose is a life that is destined for unsatisfied helplessness and defeat. Wandering from one feel good situation to the next will never allow us to experience true peace, contentment or joy.  As people we must be purpose driven.    Life is so difficult at times that it is sometimes easier to just ride the waves.  Without purpose we lack power, without power we lack direction and without direction we endanger ourselves and our future.  Sometimes we get so wrapped up in the daily tasks of living that we loose sight of the big picture.  Pain and struggling can cause us to forget what our purpose is.  Living life on a daily basis sometimes pushes us off the road and causes us to put life on hold for a moment.  Rest and healing is needed but we should not stay there forever.  We must enter back into the race that we are in and push towards the finish line.  Each of us has a race and we will eventually reach the finish line or we will not.  Is the race over when we die physically or does it begin?  Have we been created to be born, go to school, get a college degree, get married, have kids, enjoy grand children, grow old and then die?  Is there more meaning to life than that?    I choose to believe that there is a God that has a bigger purpose for us than just living this life.  This life that we live is only a shadow of the life to come as we walk through eternity.  I believe that God created us and that He can do anything that He chooses to.  I choose to believe that God has a purpose for our lives.  God desires a personal relationship with his creation.  His purpose for our lives is that we pursue Him relentlessly and allow Him to touch our lives in every area.  We need to decide to live our lives according to Gods will and not our own.  Gods purpose will give us true peace and joy and contentment.  The world that we live in certainly does not offer anything of eternal value.  God wants us to experience life and experience it abundantly.            James Moffitt Jesus Connect Ministries http://www.jesus-connect.net jcmoffitt@jesus-connect.net

       Jesus Connect Ministries went offline on March 5, 2002.  Without any warning the doors were closed and locked and the network is down.  Now, I am having to rebuild our family website and redirect all of my stuff.  That stinks.  Our family website is now located at http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jcmoffitt1. This site is still under construction. Our MyFamily.com community is located at http://moffittfamily.myfamily.com

      (Turning on light and blowing off the dust.....)  My virtual ministry may be gone but I am far from dead. :)  The family website that once WAS is hybernating safely on many locations awaiting a new home.  Until then our Comcast site is graciously providing us 25 mb (cough) of awesome drive space for our shadow web site.  This is giving me an excuse to play with MS Publisher and MS Front Page for html creation.  I decided that since MS Front Page is a  part of Office XP Professional and I have it that I might as well use it.    No, I wont be winning any website creation contests nor will anyone be tearing down my door for my skills but atleast we will have a web presence.  When Jesus Connect was alive and well I used to think it was important.  Now that 7 years of work has ended I am not so sure.  We are one web page out of millions.  I guess it is sort of like a business card.  You meet folks, hand out the information in the hopes that if someone does want to see you again they have a point of reference.   In the real world I have plenty of those.     Here is the URL to our Comcast Website.   http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jcmoffitt1/index.htm  Here is the URL to our MSN Users virtual home   http://www.msnusers.com/TheMoffittFamily   Today we went out and had some family fun and togetherness activities.  The first thing we did was to go bowling.  We had a blast.  I did terrible but that is allowed.  We were not there to compete but to have fun as a family.  Kristina and Justin did pretty good considering they had to use bumpers.  The next thing we did was to go to Scholotsky's and have lunch and then off to the movies to see Ice Age.  That was a neat movie.  I am not much into Disney animations but I have to say that this was a very good movie to see with the kids.  I think I laughed harder than most of the adults.    I am toying with the idea of upgrading the wife's computer to Windows XP Professional.  Katy needs access to Front Page so she can learn how to use it and make adjustments and improvements on our website.  I will probably spend the rest of the afternoon cleaning off all the spyware, adware and shareware garbage off Katy's computer before I do the upgrade.  Yeeeehaaaaaaa  Have a great weekend folks !

       Good morning world!  I woke up at 5:42 am as if it were a work day.  Go figure.  Now it is 6:35 am and my wife and I are sitting in front of our respective computer screens searching for new e-mail to consume.  All that awaited me in Outlook 2002 was the ever present SPAM.  People online begging me for my last hard earned buck.  Delete, delete , delete and then delete some more.    April 8, 2002 marked the first day that our children, Justin and Kristina, entered the public school system here in Goose Creek.  Katy also started her part time job at MUSC as a human services specialist.   We are planning on moving out of the double wide trailer that we are in and into a house with a real back yard and a fence.  We have a shopping list of what we are looking for.  Well, actually, Katy made up the list.  We are looking forward to living in a neighborhood that does not have a neighbor that has 6 rowdy children.   I am still at the Naval Weapons Station and it appears that it is possible that I will be employed there through the year 2003.  NMCI is taking its sweet time in becoming a reality and the Jacksonville Command will not be touched for another year.  I am hopeful to get some of my certification tests out of the way between now and the time I am kicked to the curb.  As far as network administration is concerned I have arrived in heaven.  I monitor 6 servers and the Network infrastructure that handles the PWC network and if everything is operating as it should I can study or read books or surf the web.  I know guys that would kill for my job.  :)  Low stress environment.  You dont find that in Corporate America these days.   Our Jessica has been gone now for 8 months and I sure do miss her.  I miss her so much some days it is all I can do to breathe.  I know that Katy likes the idea of going back to work because it probably helps her to take her mind off of thinking about Jessica.    Jeremy will be here for 42 days after June 7th and I am taking vacation from June 3rd to June 10th.  I cant wait to see Jeremy, he will be 16 years old  this month. It is hard to imagine that he is 16.  Our son is growing up before our very eyes.    I am going to be transferring my jcmoffitt.com domain off of Register.com onto a web hosting provider that provides  us more drive space, bells and whistles for my money.  Register.com does not offer anything near what other providers are now.  Katy and I need to work on getting our web site back online.  I would like to get Jessica's memorial page back online as soon as possible.  I am talking with Reynold about getting Jesus Connect transferred from Network Associates over to another web hosting provider and putting up a basic website for Jesus Connect.  I am not sure if Reynold is up to doing this so I am just trying to get him to atleast get the domain transferred out of his name over to the new hosting site so I can do something with it.    Kristina and Justin are going on a field trip today between 9 am and 3 pm so Katy and I will have the day to ourselves.  That will be weird to say the least.  Katy just told me that since the kids get out of school on May 30th and I am taking vacation on June 3rd through the 10th that we should plan a road trip back to Texas.  Wahooo, that ought to be a blast..... NOT....  We would plan on picking up Jeremy on the way back through Houston to SC.   This is starting to look like the Harry and the Hendersons movie.

       Can you believe that it is already May 1st 2002?  I for one can not.  Where oh where is time going to?  When I was younger I heard that time flies by faster and faster the older you get.  At the age of 40 this is really coming true in an alarming way.  If you are older than me then you know what I am talking about.    On May 5th we will have been without our Jessica for 9 months. Walking through Grief Year 1 is an article in response to that milestone in our lives.  Maybe I should call it a month stone instead of a mile stone.  Is there such a thing?  Katy has been working at MUSC now for about 2 weeks and today is her first paycheck out side of the home in approximately 7 years.  On May 12th of this year Katy and I will be celebrating 12 years of marriage and on May 4th of this year our Kristina will be turning 10 years old.   Justin and Kristina seem to be adjusting to public school ok.  We agree with the teacher that Justin needs to do 1st grade over again since he will be turning 7 next year.  This wont hurt him at all.  We are planning on going back to Texas in June for the first time in two years.  It will be good to see the relatives again.  We will go to Seguin Texas which is just outside of San Antonio to see Katy's sister, Lisa.    We are planning on finding a house to rent between now and July 1st of this year.  We are ready to move from where we are at and find a bigger place with a fenced in yard for the children and our dog angel to play in.

      I come from the GREAT state of Texas.  The long horn state where the highways and flatland never seem to end.  One of the television commercials that I will have etched on my brain forever goes like this.  How long has it been since you have had a bowl of wolf brand chili?  Well, neighbor that is entirely too long.  Wolf brand chili is one of those things that you can get in Texas that is hard to find anywhere else.  My wife and I miss several things about Texas.  The chili, authentic Mexican cooking and a soft drink called Big Red.  We have been gone from Texas since August of 1997 and though I do not miss the big city living in Houston we certainly miss other things and people.  We miss our family and friends that we left behind.  Not only do we not miss the big city living but also we dont miss some of the things that I remember about Houston.  I dont miss the traffic jams.  I do not miss the heat and humidity.  I dont miss the sounds of sirens at all hours of the day and night.  I do not miss the hustle and bustle of the big city.  Houston Texas is a city that never sleeps.   As a father that is walking through the grief process I have to say that there are things that I miss about our Jessica and there are things that I do not miss.  All of these things are elements of the grief that I have to work through each day and sometimes each week.   One of the things that I do not miss is the daily or weekly visits to the MUSC radiology and oncology department.  I do not miss the quarterly check ups where we would have to sit in a room for several hours while a team of people would come into the room one at a time with their legal pads or clip boards with an endless stream of repeated questions.  I do not miss the feeling of being a gold fish in a glass jar where we were some sort of specimen to be observed.  I do not miss the never-ending battle of finding a parking place for the car and having to show the teller at the booth our handicap license plate so we could get out at no charge.  I do not miss the knowing looks of the parents that I would pass in the hallways of the hospital as we would pass them with Jessica in her wheelchair wearing her hat over a hairless head.  I do not miss the feeling of helplessness as I watched our Jessica loosing the energy to live as she would lay around on the couch wishing she could be outside playing with the other children.    What I do miss is Jessica saying  Oh Daddy! when I would say something silly or unexpectedly burp in her presence.  I miss Jessicas smile because when she did, it was from ear to ear and it would light up the room.  No matter how glum I felt when Jessica smiled, especially in the last several months, it really brightened up my day.  I miss the hugs from Jessica as she struggled to show her love and affection for me.  I miss seeing Jessicas courage as she fought to keep on living from day to day despite all of the treatments and examinations that she endured.  I miss going to the mailbox and getting all of the post cards from all over the world from the Chemo Angels.  I miss going to the mailbox and getting letters from parents just like you who wrote to tell us we were not alone.   I miss watching Jessica interacting with other members of our church as they would move here from the sanctuary to the fellowship hall in her wheel chair or help her get out of the car to go inside the church.   I look back on those events now just as if it were yesterday.  The pain is no less real or present in my heart.  I remember the joys and the struggles. I remember the loss and the joy equally.  As one day melts into another I recognize that this is going to be a long journey in which we learn how to live without our Jessica.  Healing will happen slowly but surely.  Healing will mostly come from within and there will be days that God will have to supernaturally reach down from heaven and do the work for us because we will be too weak and weary to cry out to Him for help.  The difference between the memories of Jessica and Texas is that we can always drive back to Texas and experience the things that we missed the most.  On this earth and in this plane of living we will not experience Jessicas laugh or affection again.  We have the hope that she is with the Lord and that we will see her again once our lives are over here on this earth.    My hearts desire is to be the father that I need to be to my other children despite my loss. I want to know how to live through this grief process in a way that will not rip apart my existing family unit.  I want to know how to be the husband and confidant that my wife needs as she walks through her pain.  I want to know how to share my heart and life experiences through this all so that others that come after me or before me will be better equipped to handle their grief process.  As I pour out my heart and thoughts and feelings my hope is that other men just like me will find refuge.  We will not find refuge in knowing that someone else is in pain.  We will not find refuge in knowing that someone else just like me is awake at night or is having a hard time concentrating at work.  We will find refuge as we learn how to take the horrible grief and pain and channel it back to our Father who is in Heaven.   There are a lot of books and resources that are available for those of us in grief to read but the only true source of healing is going to have to come from God.  I started Fathers Refuge so that I could communicate with men who are learning how to live with the grief.  I want men to know that it is ok to talk about pain.  Men are not exempt from the harsh realities of pain.   As a man I know that it is natural for us to want to just hold it all in and appear as if nothing is wrong on the inside.  The problem with doing that is that eventually the pain will surface.  How the pain surfaces is up to us.  How we choose to walk through the grief process is going to affect our relationships with our wives and our children.  If you are not married then it will affect your relationship with your co-workers and friends.  As I walk through this process of grief I want to learn how to help men to learn how to open up and express what is going on inside.  If you are the wife, mother, relative of a man who is walking through grief be sure and know that he is not doing ok and life is not just back to normal.  He may appear to be ok but trust me when I tell you that he is not.  Gently reach out to him and let him know that you are there for him.  You do not need to have all the right answers because there are none.  All you need to know is to let him know that while you do not understand the pain you know that it is there and you care. Sometimes just listening to a person talk will make all the difference in the world.    If I can help someone find refuge for their own personal storm as they walk through grief then please direct them to the e-mail and postal address below.  I not only want to learn how to be healed, but I want to pass the healing process on to other men just like me who need a brother and a friend that understands.  That is what Fathers Refuge is all about.  You can contact me at Fathers Refuge Care of James Moffitt 159 Mapleridge Dr , Goose Creek SC 29445.  E-mail address is jcmoffitt@jcmoffitt.com      James Moffitt http://jcmoffitt jcmoffitt@jcmoffitt.com

       It is flooding here in Charleston.  In another 2 hours the yard will disappear into the ditch which is now a pond and the yard that was once there will be a sink hole.  Our double wide trailer will turn into a modern Noah's Ark as we begin to float down into the woods and then slowly rise above the trees and then over the power lines.  I hope the electricity has shorted out by then so we dont turn into big fish in a sardine can.......  It has been forever since I have written anything in my blog but since there is nothing else to do other than imitate a gold fish while I look outside at the torrential down pour I might as well write something.   I got up at 5:30 am this Saturday morning so that I could go pick up Kristina Lynn from church camp in Batesburg SC.  Batesburg SC is located just the other side of Columbia SC out in the sticks.  Apparently the state offices for Church of God of Prophecy are located in Batesburg and that is where the camps are hosted.  Justin and Kristina both attended so hopefully they both had a lot of fun.  On July 1, 2002 we will be taking both of the kids to the annual Happy Days Camp which is also located in South Carolina somewhere up I-95 out in the woods.    Katy goes to work today at 3pm and if the rain does not let up I will probably have to take her so that she does not have to fight the inclement weather.  That means that I will be getting in the car at 12 midnight to go get her. JOY !!  It appears that while Jesus Connect Domain is still a valid Internet Domain and my friend and founder Reynold Deguzman has erected a Linux Server on his cable modem service things are moving pretty slowly with development.  Will Jesus Connect Ministries ever revive?  That is the million dollar question at this moment.  The last time I looked the website was still a one line sentence stating that the web page is under construction.  Oooops, just checked the url and now it is saying the page can not be displayed.  Oh well.....  The only thing that is new on the church scene for us is that we aquired a new sound board and I was able to move from the HOT attic down to the sanctuary.  What a blessing to not have to be in the heat.  I located a young man at AKM Pro Audio who is interested in being our drummer and we are supposed to meet at the church this afternoon.  That probably wont happen with the rain.  As for membership, we lost one family and gained a couple more young couples.  I am hopeful that our church will begin to grow in 2002.  I am teaching the teenager boys bible study on two Wed's per month and other than that I just run the audio / video equipment on Sunday morning.  We have no Sunday evening service.    Ok, I guess that is it for now as far as the update goes.  Be well, be safe and may the peace and love of Jesus Christ permeate each of your days.  God bless

       Yeah!  This is SATURDAY and we got to sleep in until 8 am.  Whoaaaaaa, what a deal that is.  We normally get up at 5 am Monday through Friday so I am thoroughly enjoying this lazy morning.    I wanted to follow up on my previous post of what it means to be an American and what folks should do IF they dont like where they live.    I was not born here. I am a naturalized citizen which means that I had to live here for X amount of years and meet certain requirements BEFORE the US Government would consider me a citizen.  One of those requirements was to be able to speak the English language and to say the pledge of Allegiance.  I remember that day in Federal Court in Dallas Texas as if it were just yesterday.  I believe that I was 13 years old when I became an official citizen of the US.    My parents were military and thanks to being adopted out of an orphanage in Ashofenburg Germany I am now enjoying the freedom and priveleges of being an American. If I had not been adopted along with my blood sister we would have experienced a much harsher life.  At the age of 8 years old the boys in the orphange were forced to go out and earn money and bring it back to share with the rest of the children.  When my adoptive parents found me I had very little to my name.  I was 1 years old and had a cast on my right leg up to my knee cap.  If it were not for my parents being in the military, adopting me and giving me the many operations they did on my club foot I would never have walked.  My sister was blind in one eye and there was no hope that she would ever see right.  At the age of 17 my sister took her drivers test and eye exam without glasses and passed.   Just this last week a judge on an appellate court decided that saying the pledge of allegiance was unconstitutional.   Was he smoking some serious drugs when he came to that conclusion??

       How much JUNK do you get in your e-mail inbox??  This is one e-mail that I want to share with the world.  Yes, I am an American too and I am SO very PROUD to be one.  No, our way of life is not perfect and we have our own unique trials and tribulations that we have to work on.  Show me a culture, society or race of peope that do not.....  If you dont like what you see below let me encourage you to find a better place to live.  ______________________________________________________________________   If you want to be an American, then BE AN AMERICAN         After hearing that the state of Florida changed its  opinion and let a Muslim woman have her picture on her  drivers license with her face covered, I believe this is  even more appropriate. Read on, please!   This is an Editorial written by an American citizen,  published in a Tampa Newspaper. He did quite a job; didn't  he?   IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT.   I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are  offending some individual or their culture.   Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have  experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of  Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely  settled when the "politically correct" crowd began  complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was  offending others.   I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge  against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to  America. Our population is almost entirely composed of  descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things  that those who have recently come to our country, and  apparently some born here, need to understand. This idea of  America being a multicultural community has served only to  dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.   As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our  own language and our own lifestyle. This culture has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and  victories by millions of men and women who have sought  freedom.   We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,  Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to  become part of our society, LEARN THE LANGUAGE! "In God We  Trust" is our national motto. This is not some Christian,  right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because  Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded  this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is  certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our  schools.   If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another  part of the world as your new home, because God is part of  our culture. If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move  to another part of this planet.   We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change,  and we really don't care how you did things where you came  from. This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle.  Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to  express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity  to do so.   But, once you are done complaining, whining, and griping  about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way  of life, I highly encourage you to take advantage of one  other great American freedom, THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.   Please pass this along if you agree.

       I went to bed at 10:30 pm after taking a wonder drug called a sleeping pill.  I have always said that sleep is such a huge waste of time.  How many years do we waste lying flat on our back taking up oxygen and being useless?  LOL....  I figure that I could get a LOT accomplished during the hours that I am spending sleeping.  Then again, I dont waste a lot of time sleeping since I am up at 2 am after 4.5 hours of sleep.  The same thing happened to me last night.  Go to bed at 12:30 am and get up at 5 am to go to work.  I work 6 am until 2:30 pm at the Weapons Station.  Some afternoons I am able to sleep for several hours and that helps to recharge the batteries.  I tried to get a nap today and no such luck.   I am taking off from work on Friday and heading out to Raleigh NC for a Promise Keepers event.  I am looking forward to being blessed by the ministry of Godly men at this event and enjoying being around alot of other godly men.  My last PK attendance was in 1994 at Irving stadium in Irving Texas.  There were 50,000 men in attendance.  What an awesome 2.5 days that was.  You could say it was a mountaintop experience.    August 5 will be here before we know it.  That will be exactly one year since our Jessica has been absent in the body and present with the Lord.  It is so hard to believe that this has happened.  It is almost like a horrible nightmare that never happened.  Then again we are reminded that the nightmare is an actual reality since she is not here anymore.    I have been attending a mens bible study and accountability group on Thursday evenings for the last couple of weeks.  Some of the men go to Cathedral of Praise on Ashley Phosphate rd and some of them go to area churchs.  Derek Smith, who lives close to me has started this group and started to invite me to come.  We began to visit COP several weeks ago and really enjoyed it.  I think that we plan to continue to attend on the Saturday evenings that we have available.  The children seem to enjoy the childrens ministry there. Our home church, Grace Fellowship in Goose Creek seems to be struggling with attendance still.  It seems as if we take one step forward and go back three steps.    I was blessed by an annual raise of 3% today.  Wahooooo.  That is something to Praise the Lord about. Ok, it is 3:15 am and 5:30 is right around the corner.  I am going to sign off shortly and go back to bed......

      		 Peering down from the mountain   Can you imagine how Peter or Matthew might have felt after spending a weekend with our Lord listening to his teachings and watching how he walked amongst the people?  They must have been breathless and amazed at our Lord as he ministered to the many needs of the people and shared inspiring and life changing concepts while connecting to them in a real way.  I can not compare my experience at PK 2002 in Raleigh North Carolina to that which I have just described but I can say that it was a definite mountain top experience.    I was aware of this event approximately 1 week before the event due to hearing about it at a bible study group that I attend on Thursday evening.  As the men were talking about the preparation to finally go to this event I figured that it was too late for me to make any preparations and I considered thinking about a PK event in 2003 to attend.  It seems that I was destined to go and a ticket for the PK event was provided for me free of cost due to some one else who was unable to make it to the event.  I am sorry that this person was unable to make it but I am glad that I was able to go.  I was blessed richly to say the least.  God touched my heart in so many ways that I am bursting at the seams with all that I saw and heard.    The first PK event that I attended was in Irving Stadium, Irving Texas in 1994.  At that time I also had a wonderfully powerful experience in which I felt that there was NOTHING that could separate me from the love of God and that the gates of hell would not be able to prevail against me.   One thing that I was not prepared for after attending this event was the horrible onslaught that the enemy brought against me in the weeks to come.  I will address that later on in this document as we consider peering down from the mountain and the eventual trip off the mountain back down into the valleys of life and the approach to the gates of living in reality.  One of the things that impacted me at both events was the large number of men from all races, creeds and denominations who planned to come together under one roof and praise and worship the Lord and receive Godly instruction and encouragement.  So many times in life the secular media focuses only on the negativity of the world and the horrible consequences that can happen because of our sin nature.  How often do we see them observing and reporting on 14000 men who represent a cross section of the church in 2002?  I would venture to say not often enough.  The praise music was awesome and the teaching was tremendous.  There was enough "milk of the word" for brand new converts and enough "meat" for those of us that have been on a life journey with Christ.    Storming the Gates was the theme and the color was RED.  Red signified the blood of the lamb and white signified the fact that we as believers and Disciples of Christ have been washed in that blood and that we are a royal priesthood and a royal generation.  The entire focus of this Promise Keepers event was to remind men that we are in a special and unique place within our society.  We have the ability to change the history of this world IF we choose to embrace our Godly heritage and take up our cross and follow the Lord no matter where he leads us or what task he gives us to do.  We were encouraged and commanded to stop being passive with regards to our relationship with the Lord and with our families, churches and communities.  We were encouraged to defeat our fears and to put on our armor and to fight the good fight, to storm the gates of hell.   We were encouraged to walk out our salvation with trembling and fear.  We were reminded of the fact that one of our roles is to be the leaders that our families desperately need.  As Godly men we should serve our wives and our children in such a way that they will know and understand who God is.  We were told that our families are our first ministry and that there are no other ministries before that.  Once we get our homes in order before God and take the necessary steps to rid our lives of worldly junk then we will be able to withstand the darts of the enemy and lead other people to the cross where the power of the holy spirit and the integrity of our relationship with Christ can change those folks for eternity.   I came back from this mountain top experience realizing that there were areas where I need to grow and how that need for growth is only causing me to become stagnant in going to the next level with the Lord.  God's desire is that we will be fruit bearers and that fruit will bring forth other fruit for the kingdom.  In 1 John 1:8-10 tells us that if we say that we have no sin that the truth is not in us and Gods word has no place within us.  Spiritual arrogance costs way too much and there are too many people that are headed to eternal separation from God for me to be playing games and thinking that I have arrived.  My natural inclination is to be my worst judge and to condemn myself.  The enemy, over the years, has always battled against me in this area and I have always had to struggle to find the balance I need to know the difference between spiritual growth achieved and areas I need to grow in without condemning myself and coming up with feelings of hopelessness.   One of the speakers made a statement that made me cringe.  He said that Christ is the head of the church and He was willing to give up His life for her.  Likewise we as Christian men who are married should be willing to serve our wives and families even unto death.  He further challenged us in the fact that we will never be able to fulfill that role until we are able to give up the remote control to the television.  How can you die for your wife when you won't relinquish the controls to the TV?  I think that you could hear 25% of the oxygen being inhaled as men all over the sports arena realized an area of their lives that needs to be worked on.   I need to show my children and wife through my actions that I am willing to be a servant leader in my home.  Talk is cheap and I need to put feet to my love for them.    I was challenged in the area of prioritizing my time.  One speaker reminded us that the only way that we are going to be able to put on the full armor of God and storm the gates of Hell was to be the warrior for God that we should be. He encouraged us to remove all the junk and garbage and ungodliness out of our lives and prioritizing our time so that we can equip ourselves to fight in the battle.  We were reminded that our armor does not protect us from the rear and only from the front.  We were reminded that God asks us the same question that he asked Peter.  Do you love me more than these?  God was using fish as an example of things that Peter loved more than God but each of us can easily choose the things in our lives that represent the fish.  I am sometimes challenged with prioritizing my time and I need to spend less time in front of the idiot box (TV) and substitute that time that I regain by connecting to my family and spending more time in studying Gods word and praying.  I need to disconnect from all the things in this world that are hindering me from being at my fullest potential for the kingdom of God.    I was also challenged in the area of connecting with other men and developing godly relationships where I can be not only a mentor but also be mentored.  Spiritual arrogance, pride and having been hurt by other Christian men and churches in the past cause me to be on the defensive and to be very cautious of whom I open my heart to.   I know that in order to go to the next level with the Lord and to be the Godly Man He wants me to be that I need to get past this and to learn how to trust again.  It is so easy for me to hide behind ministry and to mask my spiritual inadequacies and needs by ignoring them and helping others.  I was challenged in the area of being sensitive to the needs of others despite what I might think.  I was reminded that Paul stated that we should try to be all things to all men for the sake of reaching them and drawing them closer to the cross.    This week we will spend time climbing down from the mountain top experience at PK 2002.   It is totally up to us how we choose to allow this experience to affect us.  We will either choose to cut out another PK notch on the spiritual belt buckle and ride the wave of emotional warm "fuzzies" until they run out OR choose to recognize the areas of my life where growth is needed.  Time is short and the fields are white unto harvest.  The work is plenty but the workers are few.  There is no time for being passive and complacent while the world around us is headed to eternal separation from God.  We need to spend time on our knees asking God to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and to surround each of us with other godly men, teachers and preachers that can help us to be equipped to be a mighty warrior and army for God.  We need to get on offense and move forward against the enemy and be proactive instead of defensive.    In 1994 I was caught off guard and did not realize just how angry that I had made our enemy.  Luckily for me God used a friend of mine that had already connected to me to help me to crawl out of the hopelessness and depression that the attack caused in my life.  My friend redirected my focus and helped me to remember the vision that God had given me and showed me that God does not expect me to be perfect.  God expects for me to be obedient and to take my life one day at a time and to leave the battle to Him.  God is much more powerful than I am.  My friend showed me that I could not defeat the enemy in my mind by myself.  My friend showed me that I needed to connect to other Christians and to draw strength from them so that I could find the hope and get back into the battle.   In 2002 I expect the enemy to attack and I will determine to connect to other men in my life who love the Lord and will allow me to join in the offensive with them as we determine to storm the gates of hell together.

       It is always good to return home even if it is from a mountain top experience.  The thing about mountain top experiences is that they are useless if you do not appy those things that you have learned to practical every day living.   In 1994 I went to a Promise Keepers event and that was a mountain top experience that caused me to ultimately come under attack by the enemy.  I came under heavy condemnation by the devil as he showed me that there is NO way that I could ever become the man that God wanted me to be.  Satan is a liar and a deceiver.  He is right that I in my own flesh and ability and sin nature can not become who God wants me to be.  The only way that I can become the man God wants me to be is to strip myself of all ties to this world and to submit myself to Him and learn how to be a servant leader to God, Family and church.  As I submit myself to God and to being a servant leader in my home then God will be able to mold me and shape me into His image.   Promise Keepers 2002 was just as incredible as 1994 in that it was a mountain top experience and I came away with a lot of meat to chew on for the next year. In this next couple of weeks I will pour over my notes and pick out those things that God showed me and share them with you.  I know that I have some adjustments to make especially in the area of being a servant leader.  I know that I have some areas of pride with regards to being a servant leader in my home that I need to work on.  One of the simple ways that I can improve my being a leader in my home by serving my family such as giving up the remote control and letting the family watch what they want to watch while I am there. Instead of making my family a gopher (go for this and go for that ) I should get off my lazy duff and go do it myself for a change.  Sometimes the small things make a world of difference.    Well, it is time to be the Godly Man and leader that I should be and lead my family into the face of God by taking them to church.   More good stuff to come folks, please stay tuned to this channel.    God bless

      I spent three hours with my friend Derek yesterday at his house. It looks as if Derek is going to be going down a different path with regards to what he is doing with cell groups and ministry at his home church. Derek asked me to take over leadership of the existing cell group as he goes down this different path and will be making the announcement of his changes on this next Thursday. I told Derek that I would be honored to take over the small mens group on Thursday. We discussed bringing the men to a finish line quickly. Some of the men have been walking with Derek and the sexual purity accountability group since January. Some of the men for only 2 months. Derek and I agreed that while support groups and cell groups are great and a good way to connect to other men and bring healing to the hurting that it also can bring the trap of being an enabler for men to abuse grace. In other words the trap for some folks would be to grow comfortable in the thought that the cell group will always be there and that they can loose sight of the goal. If the cell group just goes on forever and people just cycle in and out of the ever turning washer machine type mentality then there will be some folks who will never reach the finish line.   So, with that said we will be proposing to the men that it is time to put this issue to rest, once and for all in their lives. When we say that we want to bring the men to a finish line it does not mean that we think they will never be tempted with sexual impurity again but it does mean that we will get to a point where we decide that we will put to action those principles that we have learned about sexual purity and then get on with our lives. Yes, some men will stumble and fall and they will need some follow up work from time to time but we also believe that there should be a time of accountability and maturity and responsibility where the men take possesion of the issues and finally make the decision to break free.   When we bring the men to the finish line I will be proposing that we start a series using either the PK workbook we got in Raleigh, Maximized Manhood by Ed Cole or Man in the Mirror.

      Does anyone ever read this drivel?  Do you?  If you do please send me a short note at jcmoffitt@charter.net and tell me so.  If you do that will encourage me to continue my blathering in cyberspace.  :)  Is there such a word as blathering?  Sigh....  Well, week one at our new place in Simpsonville SC is almost complete.  We moved in our new place last Saturday and we are STILL un packing boxes and playing house.  :)  We have a fireplace, 2 bathrooms, a fenced in yard and a kitchen that Katy just loves.  You know what they say.  When mom is happy the whole house is happy.  Well, Katy is pretty happy about our new digs. So the rest of us are living in pleasantville for now.  :)  We really do live out in the country now.   It takes about 5 minutes to get to the ONLY 2 stop and robs down the street but other than that it is a 30 min drive into town.  Wahoo.  We love it!  My new job (contract) is on week number 5.  There were some bumps and glitches along the way but I think that things have smoothed out a bit.  Praise the Lord for that.  Whew.   I was starting to wonder what I had gotten into.  I went from idle to running at mach 3 with my hair on fire.  I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.    Today we will put together a new entertainment unit.  Tomorrow we will look for a new church home.  Actually, tomorrow just starts that maddening process where we go from church to church hoping and praying that we can find where we are supposed to be.  It took us 6 months to do that in Goose Creek and I literally had to wind up in the hospital to meet our new pastor.  Geeesh, hope that does not have to happen this time.  :)  I think that my tummy is calling me to breakfast and I know that I must obey or I will be severely punished.  :)

       I feel my blood going hot here. I find myself surrounded by people that are professing Christians who are experts at describing what a problem is but not as adept at finding a solution to the problems that have been infecting our society for centuries.   Our world is being invaded by an infestation on multiple planes and the best that we can all do is complain about it and describe it in all of our fantastic verbiage.   Don't get me wrong folks.  We need to IDENTIFY the problem.  Now we need to do the next thing, which is to do SOMETHING about it.  My question to each of us is simple.  WHY is pornography so rampant in our society?  Why is SEX such a commodity?  Why does the church of the living God stand by quietly while church members are sucked into this evil lifestyle and when they admit they need help it is swept under the rug and they are told that their behaviour is normal.  When is the church of the living God going to direct and train their membership to true accountability and restoration?  How many churches in America are modeling the BPM program like that of Central Church in Tenn?  Why aren't there more men of God who are taking this program to the streets and the churches of America?  How many of us are spending more time fighting the sexual addiction in our own lives in a topsy turvy roller coaster ride vs finding true victory and helping others to be restored?  We have the knowledge.  We have the technology and we have the leadership and the finances.  We need to figure out how we can use what God has given us to ERADICATE this garbage from the church of the living God FIRST and then when those folks are fired up and out of the closet and restored then we can form an ARMY of the living God that we are supposed to BE and go crash down the GATES OF HELL.  I am sick of just talking about this. Who amongst us is willing to spend their money, time and talents to actually do more than wallow in sexual sin and mere acknowledgement of the issue?  Yes, Battle Plan Ministries is here.  Setting the Captives Free is alive and well.  Love in Action is alive and well.  How many other PROGRAMS do you know of that are in place and doing their part to put a dent in this problem?  My point is simple. God does not need a program.  God needs YOU and ME to be willing to stand up for what we believe in and take a REAL STAND in our communities.    I submit to you that the church of the living God is way too passive, complacent and weak to make a dent in most of the problems we see plaguing our society.  What about our leadership?  Where are our Under Shepherds in all of this?  Why IS it that our church members are struggling with alcohol, drugs, sexual addiction, gambling and spousal abuse?  Why IS it the church of the living God is not yanking all of this SIN out of the closet and doing something REAL to address the issues and call sin a sin and restore people to either righteousness or casting the garbage out of the church.   The answer to most of those questions should make us physically ill when we face the truth.  We are way too happy in our suburban homes with our suburban lifestyles and our stuff.  Why is it that only 10% of the church do 100% of the work?  The world around us may not embrace a relationship with Christ. That doesn't mean that they are deaf, blind and dumb.  They can watch and see how much effort is being put forth within our churches and what type of affect it is having in our lives Monday through Friday.  If some of these issues really bothered us then would we not be willing to do something, anything to make a difference?    The sad fact of the matter is this. If the problem is not hitting close enough to home then we take the stance of indifference.  We would rather make a fuss about our next door neighbors dog barking in the middle of the night causing us to loose sleep than to get out of our comfort zones and security bubbles to make a difference in real issues that are affecting our very way of life.    I submit to YOU my friends and co laborers in Christ that we are NOT doing enough. There are victims and predators all around us.  Through the power of the living God we CAN and SHOULD be making a DIFFERENCE.  The million dollar questions are as follows.  A. When will we get sick enough of being sick enough of the issues? B. When will we pool our resources together and become a REAL church body that does what it takes to MAKE a real difference.    By myself I can not make a difference outside of the scope of my personal life or the life of my family. I can influence the people in the community that God has placed me in. I can move people emotionally and spiritually as I call them into battle.  Only when we as brothers and sisters in Christ work together with the church leadership can we actually make a lasting difference in the world around us.  Our leadership needs to be motivated to stop sweeping the problems under the rug.  Our leadership needs to stop wasting our money on building programs and finding new ways to tickle the ears of the sinner's that are already taking up room in the church.  Our leadership needs to be called into action to be the REAL church leaders that they are supposed to be so that they can lead US into the paths of righteousness for HIS NAMESAKE. Only then will the church of the living God make a lasting impression on this world.    What will you do to start this process? Whatever it is that you will do I want to network with you and help you in any way that I can. Together WE can and MUST make the difference.  The world around us depends on us to do it whether they realize it or not.    Your servant leader James Moffitt Jesus Connect Ministries

      On December 4th 2002 at approximately 7:30 pm the lights began to flicker and then finally went out for good.  The lights went out because of accumulated ice and freezing rain that had been coming down all day.  The power stayed out until that Friday Dec 6th around 4pm.  The article directly below this drivel was written because of this event.  :)

      The cable service went out again after being off for 2.5 days and my mind is wandering aimlessly wondering what to do next.  I spent 30 minutes playing Hyper Bowl on my computer and then wandered over to solitaire and quickly became bored. We came home from church after the Christmas play and dinner in hopes of curling up in front of the television to watch another showing of Alias.  My wife and I looked at each other and voiced our concern about missing a continuation sequel to last weeks Third Watch program that is shown on Monday evening.    As I catalog and analyze within my mind all the different possibilities that I have for entertaining myself this evening it occurs to me that I am a slave to technology and modern conveniences.  It was amazing to me how much I got done in the two and a half days while the cable service was out.  During our loss of Cable TV and high speed Internet access I was able to find the time to do some office cleaning and organization that sorely needed to get done.  When the modern conveniences are available to lull me into a sense of tranquility and otherwise occupy my mental attention I am able to let other things go in life that perhaps would need my attention.    Life is what we make of it and there is nothing wrong with modern conveniences.  We all love electricity which provides us with power for heating, AC, appliances and power for our computers.  How much time and energy is being sucked out of our days because of modern conveniences and technology?  How much value is being added to our lives because of modern technology and how much is being taken away?  Do we even think about what we might be missing because of our aversion to what modern technology makes available to us?  No matter how addicted you may be to modern day conveniences or technology the life cycle never stops.  Life marches on and if you are not careful it will pass you by while you are lost in the haze.  All around us we see advertisers trying to determine our self worth and our value to society by convincing us that we must have this and we must have that.  Marketing firms spend millions trying to convince us that we can look younger, thinner and that clothing, cars, prestige, power and that special house will cause you to be successful.  We are aware of the subliminal messages and even though we may not make a conscious effort to pursue the hyped up dreams of the advertisers subconsciously we are making note of what they are saying and if we are not careful we can get sucked into a trap that will cause us to chase our tails in the pursuit of obtaining all that we can get our hands on.    Television, Cable, Satellite TV, Internet, radio, news media in written form and other forms of media that I am probably forgetting capture a large portion of our attention span.  Media outlets of all types provide us with one thing and that is information.   How we receive the information, how often we consume it and finally what we do with it determines how much value it adds or subtracts to our lives.  Information and misinformation is swirling all around us and it is our choice to control what comes into our minds and how we will utilize it.    How can this be you may be asking yourself.  How can we allow all of this information which bombards us from every angle to control our lives and consume so much of our time.  How can we manage our daily lives more effectively and use the technology as a tool which will add value to our lives?  Some of you may even be in denial as you read this and think that you are not wasting any precious time and that there is nothing wrong with being entranced by the endless flow of information that is shoved down our throat on a daily basis.  How many of us are just happy about the way things are and have no intention of even considering some of these thoughts?    My challenge to you is simple.  Find a piece of paper and a writing instrument and make a list of tasks that need to get done around the house.  These tasks could be anything.  Tasks that take 5 minutes to accomplish or tasks that could be large enough to be projects that would take hours of your time every day to accomplish.  When the task list for around the house is done consider doing a list of things that you need to do that involves your family.  If you don't have an immediate family what about your relatives, parents, children etc?  Is there anything that has been neglected there because of a lack of time to do it?  Think about any area of your life that would require time and attention to get things done.  How big is your list getting to be now?    I am as guilty as you are.  I love these modern conveniences and technology and flow of information that comes from it all.  I believe that when Mother Nature dumps tons of ice and snow on us and causes all of our man made technology to come to a grinding stop because of power failure I believe that it gives us time to stop and consider all of this.   I am not advocating that we throw out our coffee pot, dishwasher and personal computers for the sake of getting back to oneness with our neighborhood or community.  What I am advocating is that we take a step back from the daily madness and consider how much time is being utilized for the good of our humanity vs. just wasting our time and being yet another avenue of endless entertainment.

       Have you ever had a tooth ache?  If someone tells you their tooth hurts please feel sorry for them.  Up until this date, January 22, 2003 I have never experienced the pain of a tooth ache.  It took me 41 + years for it to happen and now Ambesol and I are very close friends.  :)  I wonder how long it has been since I wrote in my blog?  I bet it has been atleast 30 days, if not longer.  I think that blogging is sort of like having a personal journal. I wonder what the difference is between a blog and a journal?  That reminds me.  I need to write a biography about myself for www.freelancewriters.com.  I joined that site so that I can be listed in a database of freelance writers in the hopes of getting some writing assignments.  I am using w.blogger version 3.00 to write this thanks to Chris over at Lockergnome.  Chris has a LOT of useful tips and applications that he tells us folks about.  So, we shall see what this freeware interface does for the blogging experience.    I have been looking for a full time job or a better contract since Ahold laid off 36 people this last November.  Thus far I have not found anything that appeals to me.  A position came available for a Network Administrator in Myrtle Beach but they only offer 47k to 49k to start.  They are asking for the world for that sort of pay.  Gosh, maybe I am just down right spoiled and greedy aye?  Speaking of Myrtle Beach.  Katy and I spent last weekend at Ocean Reef Hotel in North Myrtle Beach at our second attendance at renaissance Weekend which was hosted by Happy Days and Special Times.  There was a reporter there that was doing a story so hopefully we will get a copy of it through E-mail.  That would be cool enough.  :)  This year was better than the first since we hooked up with Anthony and Gale Keech who are our new found crazies here in the Upstate. :)  Gosh, Ambesol IS my best friend.  As long as the pain is subsided I am a happy camper for now.  Tomorrow, I make a local Dentist a friend and I plan to contribute part of my budget to him.  :)

           This is a picture of our front yard in January 2003 after the snow storm.  We got 4 inches that day.          This is Justin Matthew Moffitt in the front yard of our house in Simpsonville.   Neat stuff, yes it is.....

         First we lost the Challenger in 1986 and today we lost Columbia.  At approximately 8 am CST NASA in Houston Texas lost telemetry data with Columbia and soon after that they lost audio contact with the astronauts.  Debis from the space shuttle wound up scattered across the state of Texas and into Louisiana.  We lost another 7 people to the space program.  This is a sad day indeed.  Yesterday I lost my job at Ahold USA and once again I am seeking full time employment either as a contractor or a full time employee.   I have two recruiters that want to talk to me next week because I have been putting my resume on job search boards since November of 2002 when Ahold USA laid off 32 full time employees.    We are on the brink of war with Iraq as our military is gearing up for a major offensive half way across the world.  Stay tuned, more to follow...

       I am on forced vacation starting today thanks to my contract at Ahold ending without a whole lot of warning.  I saw the writing on the wall and knew that it was coming but I was hoping that the contract would atleast last until April of 2003.  No such luck boys and girls.  Now I am back out on the Internet slinging my resume at every job board that can be found.  Luckily for me I saw the writing on the wall in November of 2002 and started the madness then.  The IT industry basically sucks for now.  There are jobs out there to be had but the pay is way down and the employers want certifications and experience out the wazooo.  This is an employers market now and they can pick and choose from a wealth of candidates.    I figure that we have about 2 weeks before I need to push the panic button and just take anything I can put my hands on.  Katy and I know that if push comes to shove the kids go to public school and she goes back to work.  Going back to work for Katy will be tough because she has not had to work outside the home for a long time.  The awesome thing is that we are a family and we are committed to doing whatever it takes to survive.  Surviving means lights, telephone, rent and food.  That does not mean high speed Internet, cable tv or cellular service.  All of that is extra stuff that we certainly do not need to survive.  Will we miss those things?  Yes, those things will be missed but we can learn to do without if need be.    If you think about it life would be so much less complicated without a lot of the things that I just mentioned.  I am praying that God will provide and that I wont have to give up our wants or desires.  The trick is to have faith and be patient and wait on Gods timing for all of this to come together.   I am writing this sort of as a journal so that I can look back and praise God for meeting our needs once again.    While I am on forced vacation I will have the opportunity to hang out with the family and do family things such as bowling practice with the children today.  Kristina and Justin are both on a youth bowling league where they are learning how to bowl.  We had a blast today and I am thankful for the time to spend with my family.  That means more to me than any amount of money that I might be able to put my hands on.  Our children are our investment that we are sending out into the future.

      It has been FOREVER since I have drivled in here.  How long is forever?  Maybe I should say it has been a LONG time since I have said anything of worth in here.  Perhaps today is the day that I speak up.    I am waiting for breakfast to arrive from Katy's kitchen and for Actifed to kick in to stop the raging allergy symptoms that have taken over this morning.  I made the mistake of preparing to mow the yard and all the alergins known to man took over my sinuses.  Whew, it was ugly.    It appears that operation Iraqi Freedom is in full affect as Allied forces are approaching the Iraq capital of Bagdad.  Some say that this war will cause the economy to flourish and that the jobless folks like me will soon be employed again.  Does it really take a war to make the economy flourish?  How does that work?  We use more bombs, we run out of bombs, we need more bombs, can you make us more bombs and therefore I go to work at a bomb factory even though I do not know squat about how to make a bomb?  Hummmmm.....  I can see where there would be more need for items that are used in a battlefield.  I am not sure if that will create more technology jobs though.   I am on week 8 of unemployment or day 49 with no income other than the paltry 278.00 from SEC.  Dont get me wrong, I am appreciative of the fact that we do have unemployment benefits since neither one of us is working.  I thought that Katy's degree would help her to find even menial work like at Walmart but apparently there is a huge supply and demand problem.  There are jobs but there are hundreds of applications being turned in for one job.  I bet the employers love the applicant pool but they probably hate the process of figuring out who to hire and who to toss.   I have two contracts that recruiters have submitted me for.  One is for a contractor positon in Washington DC and one is for a contractor in downtown Greenville.  If this were a perfect world I would pick door number two.  I would LOVE to find employment here locally.  Push comes to shove I will go to Washington if I have to.  Thanks to Ebay I am making some suplimental income doing auctions.  How sick of Ebay can a person get?  On a scale of one to ten I am almost to an 8 with regards to how sick I am.  Luckily for me I have a WONDERFUL wife that is willing to kick in some extra effort when I could care less about the whole thing.  Thank you Jesus for Katy.  :)  Ok, food almost here and I am famished.  Talk to you later!

       We spent the last couple of days looking at "cheaper" accomodations.  Oh my gosh.  The places that I found for 200.00 or 300.00 less than what we are paying are not fit for a dog to live in.  Do I live in a mansion now and do I have a pride problem going on here?  Absolutely not.  I can garuntee you that these places are fully qualified rat traps complete with broken windows, tons of rust and lots of missing pieces.  One trailer park owner assured us that he intends to renovate.  I told Katy and the kids that the only renovation option left to this guy is to drop a nuclear device in the middle and start over after the radiation kills off all of the garbage that is there now.     Living out of our cars and being homeless are just not an option as you can imagine.  I spoke with my landlord today and he told me he would be willing to reduce our rent to 600.00 per month and as long as we paid that amount anytime during that month that he would allow us to remain. Once we find gainful employment and are back on our feet then he will raise the rent back to 750.00.  That is the BEST offer that I have gotten to this date.  I told him that I certainly appreciated his willingness to help us and that we would be more than able to accomplish this task with what we are receiving in unemployment.    If the cell phones have to be turned off then so be it.  If cable has to go then so be it.  We will have to do what we have to do to make sure we have a roof over our heads while we are looking for gainful employment.  After driving around for the last two days looking at rat traps and the accomodations that others have to live in I feel SUPER blessed and we are MORE than motivated to do what we need to do to stay where we are.    This evening Katy got a call from the manager at a Chucky Cheese.  They have several openings and Katy has an interview at 2:30pm on Monday. We got a big kick out of the fact that they have an opening for one of the characters.  That would certainly be appropriate for me since I can be a character at times.

       On two seperate occasions today I was reminded of the loss of our Jessica and how painful it still is.  It seems as if the emotions are right under the surface only to be awakened by the right stimulus.  Today I watched a movie and a TV show where a loved one was lost.  This rekindled my feelings of loss and that loss is still painful.  The pain is just as real today as it was on August 5, 2001 as I watched the funeral home director remove my daughters lifeless body from our home on 159 Mapleridge Dr in Goose Creek SC.   It is still so hard to believe that we will not see our Jessica again this side of eternity.  It is still so hard to believe how cancer changed our little girl right before our eyes.  I was reminded that I need to light a candle for my "sunshine angel".   I had not done that in a very long time.  I guess the act of lighting a candle helped me in some way but it also reminded me of the truth of what has happened.  Our lives will never be the same and even though Jessica is gone she will always be in our hearts, souls and minds.  We love you Jessica Ann Moffitt , You are our Sunshine!!

       To move or not to move, that is the question.  Today is April 4 and I am still under employed and over appreciated.  How in the world did we get to this point?  The economy apparently sucks in the Upstate and we are so happy that we moved here.  NOT!!!  We have come to the conclusion that staying at 4 Broken Past Ct is not financially feasible since we do not have the income to support the rent payment.  We need to drastically reduce our expenses and the biggie is the rent.  Luckily for me the ex wife is being flexible with regards to child support but that cant slide forever.  I need a job and I need it now.  Katy and I both are looking for work and thus far there is nothing.  Katy might be able to find something sooner than me since she has a degree.  I would have never thought it would have taken this long for us to find employment.    Katy got up at 5 am and went to Walmart to pick up some boxes.  We are surrounded in cardboard boxes now.  Wahooooo!  Now we have something to occupy our time.  Filling boxes with our belongings.  We may have to have a moving sale so that we can get rid of some of our stuff.  Depending on where we move to we might not have enough room for all of this stuff.  The last thing I want to do is sell what we have.  In August of 1997 we sold everthing that we owned and put the rest in two vehicles and moved to Douglasville Ga.  That was a mistake then and it is a huge mistake now.  When you are in survival mode you do what you have to do I suppose.  Survival mode on.....  The important thing is that we have one another.  We will survive this.  We always have and always will.  This too shall pass.  We just need to suck it up and do what we have to do to survive.  One day at a time sweet Jesus, that is all we are asking from you.  Just give us the way to do every day what I have to do.  Yesterday is gone sweet Jesus and tomorrow may never be mine....  Familiar words that we have sung over and over through the years but singing is much easier than doing at this point.    Ok, now to look beyond our family and the immediate needs.  The biggest thing that seems to be going on now is the war with Iraq.  We are on day 15 now.  By now I would imagine that our troops are in Baghdad going from house to house and building to building engaging in urban warfare to root out Saddam Hussein's elite guard.  It appears that the best that the Iraqi goverment can come up with is sneak suicide attacks in the form of suicide bombers.  Several cars have blown up at check points killing everyone inside including coalition troops.  Those are the acts of terrorists and not a military response to our invasion.  How sad that is.    On the church front it seems that we have found a church that we like and it is called Marathon Community Church.  You can visit the church web site at http://www.marathonchurch.org  We love the praise and worship, drama team and teaching.  This church is following the "purpose driven church" model which is modeled after the church in California called Saddleback church.   April 6th has a membership class 101 from 3pm until 5pm and I think that we are going to attend if we can.

       Lets review for a moment on all of the "stuff" that has to be reloaded on your computer "after" you rip out the motherboard and install a new one.  Nah, lets skip that list.  You would be asleep in no time. I will tell you that I just reinstalled w.blogger that is the windows based tool that allows me to post to my Web Log (blogger) when I get the urge to do so.  I guess this means that I have the urge to do so since you are reading this.  Winter bowling leagues are coming to an end.  Friday nights are over and Tuesday night league just ended.  That means that I can fill those nights with other more important tasks.  Dont get me wrong, I love to bowl but too much of a good thing can become a drag.  Bowling on four leagues was just a bit too much.  This summer I will bowl on Monday night and I think that will be about all.  I have a Sunday night league that starts at 8pm that will be ending in the next 2 weeks and then that will be over.  We won 3rd place on our Tuesday night spare timers league and I gathered up three patches and one pin for bowling over 200 on several occasions.  Now I need a bowling shirt to put those on.   I have two books that I want to read in the month of May and June if I can manage to prioritize my life to do so.  The Purpose Driven Life and the Purpose Driven Church by Rick Warren.  Let me give you a glimpse of what the Purpose Driven Life has to offer and how it is changing my life in a positive way.  Here is a quote by George Bernard Shaw that just dinged me between the eyes.    "This is the true joy of life: the being used up for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; being a force of nature instead of a feverish , selfish little clot of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy"      Can you say ouch and double ouch?  I have a  red  spot between my eyeballs when that sucker slammed head first into my noggin.  I am continually reminded that life is just not fair and bad things happen to good people.  Good things happen to bad people.  Imagine that for a moment?  My life perspective is my life perspective so humor me as I go down this road for a second.  My perspective is that life has certainly had its fair share of negatives since June of 2000.  Between June of 2000 and today I have been in survival mode.  I have been enduring life and responding to the circumstances and consequences of things.  Doing this has put me in a pretty foul mood to the point of affecting my health , my family and my friends.  Gosh, did I forget to put the most important thing in my life here?  More importantly my relationship with God has been affected too.    People that know me and are privy to all of the events that have unfolded since June of 2000 would tell you that we handled our situation very well and that we did not allow our situation to destroy our faith in God.  All I can say is that if we did glorify God through all of this mess then I have to give the praise and honor and glory back to God because it was nothing that we did.  God brings glory to himself through his children sometimes without them being aware of it and through His divine will and intervention. God also brings glory to himself through a life of brokeness and obedience to His word. There were times when I screamed at God and got angry.  Lets just say that God does have a sense of humor and I am happy that I am still alive to write this.   Loosing my job in Feburary has set into motion a chain of events that have ADDED to the stress levels at the Moffitt house.  Remember that I said earlier that bad things happen to good people.  Loosing my job which was our ONLY source of income to pay bills was a BAD thing.  I also have to say that my responses at times to this stress has not necessarily given any glory to God either.  I responded to the stress by withdrawing into myself and lashing out at other people who care about me.  I responded by trying to do things like bowling that made me happy. The problem with trying to bury bad things and unfortunate circumstances with things that make you happy is that happiness is circumstantial and it only lasts for a brief period of time.  When the event is over that makes you happy you find yourself face to face with the problems again.    Survival mode has lasted for long enough.  Out with the OLD mindset and in with the new.  Instead of being a survivalist in a fallen world and being tossed too and fro through the whirlwinds of emotional chaos I am going to choose to realign my life with the purposes that God has for me and my family.  I am going to choose to redefine the things that make me happy and rediscover the Hope that is within me.  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  The only way that I can cling on to hope is to immerse myself in faith building activities such as prayer, reading the word of God and other resources that will give me what I need for restoration.  Does that mean that I will no longer have problems?  No, it means that I am going to do what I can to let God redefine how I am going to react to these problems.  Is the glass half full or half empty?  Will good come out of bad or not?  Will I approach life with a positive , humble and contrite spirit or will I try to tackle everything by myself and put my faith and hope in my ability to provide for my family?    I need to learn how to be who God wants me to be despite how others respond to me. In the past I have tried to develop relationships with others and when they did not respond in the correct way I either found fault in them or I would withdraw into myself and blame myself for some type of fault that was keeping people from responding.  If people do not respond like I expect them or want them to then I will not be myself anymore.  I will just become an introvert and stop reaching out to people.  The only problem with that is my attitude towards people and I am short circuiting who I am in Christ because of those attitudes.    I can not let how others respond or not respond define who I am.  I must not continue to keep my eyes on people because as long as I do I will be disappointed.  No one is perfect, not one.  I must keep my eyes and mind focused on Christ.  I need to allow people to be who they are and let the Holy Spirit be the one to convict them of whatever problems they might have within the dimensions of his authority and timing.  Only the Holy Spirit can convict people of sin and change them.  I can not and should not try to be anyone's Holy Spirit.    If you are reading this and you are not a Christian then you probably do not understand what I am talking about. I would imagine that you probably have not even gotten this far in my writings today.  You probably have zipped through some of this and just gone on to other things.  For those of you that are my friends and who follow my babbling from time to time I hope that my being brutally honest and real does not scare you away.  I hope that my being real will not only be therapeutic to me as an individual but that it in turn will encourage you to know that you are not the only one that struggles with spiritual turmoil.  The only way that we can grow in grace is by being real with God and with one another and to encourage one another to reach out to God with a spirit of repentance and humility so that God can restore us into a right relationship with Him and with one another.  God is in the restoration business and He is not done with me yet !

       May 15th 2003 is upon us.  Actually, the day is almost half gone.  What have I accomplished?  Does mowing the backyard and returning consignment computer equipment to my distributer count?  What have you accomplished today?  Recently I upgraded my Gateway PIII 866 mhz workstation to a 1.1 gigglehertz motherboard and 640 mb of ram.  Can you say ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM??  How many people who are supposed computer geeks told me that I would never be able to upgrade my Gateway because it was too proprietary?  More of them than not.  My Gateway is housed in a typical ATX motherboard with a 300 watt power supply.  It was a simple as out with the old and in with the new.  The only problem we ran into was with the case and the front USB cabling.  To get around the proprietary wiring scheme we just put a USB card into an empty pci slot in the back and now I have four USB ports just like before.  The only change is that they are all in the back instead of two in front.  No big deal.    I LOVE how fast this new machine is.  It boots up 3x as fast and the applications are much zippier.  Wahoooo!  When was the last time you ran live update on your Anti Virus software running on your computer?  This serves as a reminder to you if you have not.  There is a new trojan horse virus on the loose and it could come visiting if you use Kazaa or ICQ.

        I am starting to think that we live in a rain forrest and that we skipped summer and went straight into winter.  This weekend was spent at the flea market and the temperature was 53 and it rained more than not.  If you would have asked me on Saturday morning if I thought we would be able to make enough money to be profitable for the weekend I would have said no.  Nevertheless  going to the flea market is something we can do for ourselves to better our unemployment blues.  We owe we owe so off to work we go is our motto.  Some of you work Monday through Friday from 8 until 5 and we work Wed, Saturday and Sunday.  We do not necessarily like it but for now it is helping us to stay afloat.  My prayer on Saturday morning was two fold.  I prayed that the Lord would turn the water spigot off and that he would send people with disposable income.  God answered both of my prayers but not necessarily in the order or timing that I would have expected.  Saturday morning the water spigot was turned off for about an hour which gave us time to unload our cars and get set up.  Then the water was turned back on.  We needed to rake together 293.00 to cover a rent check and the light bill that needs to clear our checking account this week.  Thanks to our being able to sell Katy's computer we were able to get almost twice that amount which means the immediate emergency is taken care of.  Thank you Jesus for providing for us in this way.  Did I have the faith that God would provide this weekend?  I guess that in some small way that I did because I did go out there even though I thought in my flesh and spirit that there was NO way that people would come to the flea market in the cold and rain.    I did not sell Katy's computer until 2:00 pm on Sunday when this guy walked up and was slightly interested in the deal.  This person told me that they had been looking for a long time for a good deal and a good deal he certainly got.  I told him that I thought God probably sent him by my table that day and that I was extremely thankful for his purchase.  I also found out that this person also sells and works on computers and buys them in bulk which means that I may have made another local contact with someone that could provide me with consignment machines.    If I were to have it my way I would have a full time job making what I am used to make and we would not have to worry about bills and when they get paid.  I believe that God has other ideas about providing for our family.  Gods word says that we will never beg for bread and that our basic needs will be taken care of.  Even though I have been under employed and over appreciated for over 95 days now we have not had to loose anything with regards to utilities and service.  We have had to choose to sell off some of the extra STUFF that we have which are not required for every day life.  Thusly Katy's computer has a new home.  Are we happy about our belongings becoming a savings account for the flea market?  No, we are not happy.  The important thought here is that our happiness does not necessarily equate to our needs being met.  Wants and temporary happiness do add up though.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to be happy or experiencing happiness.  What causes us problems though is when we prioritize our lives in such a way that we make decisions based on what makes us happy and fulfilled.  We can not live our lives according to our emotional feelings but rather according to those priorities and purpose that God has for us at the moment.     I would rather that my needs be supplied abundantly and in advance so that my faith would not have to be tested on a daily basis.  I would rather be happy and not have to experience stress and anxiety because of the bills that are piling up.  The million dollar question is this.  If everything is taken care of and there are no needs or dependency upon me to trust in Christ how much faith do I have and how much glory is given to Christ?  When we are weak He is strong.  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  If all of my needs are provided for and I do not have to strain or struggle with regards to hearing God then what will get my attention?  When I am happy and everything is going my way will I choose to HEAR God or will I fill my days with the activities of life that will drown Him out?  How will others see God working in my life?  How will I grow in grace and spiritual maturity if my happiness is continually determined by temporary events and stuff that just clutters up my life?    We are not alone in this struggle.  There are a lot of people who are unemployed and struggling to make ends meet.  Perhaps we are going through this so that we can learn how to live with less and how to maintain our faith and JOY despite of our external circumstances.  Someone reminded me of Job recently.  What we are experiencing is a JOKE compared to that.  Compared to Job and how HE reacted to what HE experienced I have been reduced into a sniveling clot of whimpering whining.  The ouch factor on that is pretty severe but sometimes we need to be yanked out of our pity parties aye?    I am hopeful that out of the whining, wailing and knashing of teeth that I will learn what I am supposed to learn and that I will be able to share what I am learning in such a way as to impact the lives of others and produce spiritual fruit and life and restoration in the way that God would have me to.    Blessings to you our friends.  May God bless you and keep you as you walk out your walk of faith this day and week.    In His service James Moffitt

       A friend and co laborer in Christ wrote the following thoughts and questions and I was inspired to write my thoughts below.    I look around me, being me, and I ask, "Why Lord!" And I also ask, "How, Lord! ... How can we do what you've called us to do! ... What you've called me to do!"    I think that one of our problems is that we get so caught up in all of the tiny details of our lives and all our problems and circumstances. Doing this causes us to have tunnel vision and we fail to see the big picture.    God is not finished working on us yet and while He does not expect us to be perfect like Himself He does expect us to work towards an attitude and lifestyle of holiness, spiritual humility and contrition.  The process of holiness and being made completely unto His image lasts a life time and sometimes when we see our human fragilities and we become critical of our failures and think to ourselves that we are failures.  The liar and deceiver of our souls are always ready to show us our imperfections and tendencies to have wicked and evil thought lives.   What separates us from the love of Christ?  The bible says that NOTHING can separate us from His love.  His love is perfect, his love is eternal, and his grace is for you and me.  Nevertheless we get so caught in our own mental and spiritual and emotional traps that we forget whom we are and whom we belong to.  We are then ensnared by our own emotional, spiritual and sometimes physical chains of bondage.    If you take a Christian and put him or her next to an unbeliever what would you say makes us different?  What is supposed to make us different?  The only thing that separates us from the chaff is that we are saved by Grace and the Holy Spirit of God resides in our hearts.  Do we really think that our holiness is purely driven by our own self constraint and self control?  No, our ability to be holy because He is Holy is because of His power and mercy and grace that resides within us and shines forth like the noonday sun. The more we die to ourselves and the more we release control of our lives to the Holy Spirit the more HE can change our lives from the inside out and the more we can radiate the love of Christ and the mercy of God to those who are around us.    If we are not radiating the love and mercy and truth of God to others in our communities it is because there is something keeping that from happening. What is keeping the love of God from being radiated from our lives to those that are around us?  Are we walking the walk consistently or are we talking the talk?  Does our faith walk shine forth with a life full of confidence and integrity or do we compromise our faith when we think it is convenient or profitable to do so?  When will we get beyond the works mentality? We think that if we attend church religiously every time the church doors are open that we have satisfied some sort of requirement.  We carry our bibles and note pads to the pews and take notes.  We smile and say nice things to people around us and appear to be the people we are supposed to be.  Inside we are sick and dying because of all the infirmities and hidden skeletons in our closed up closets.  How can we as the living church of God reach our communities when we ourselves need intensive care?  Evil will always reside in this fallen world and there will not be peace on earth as long as our enemy is allowed to wander this earth.  God's people however can and shall make the difference in the lives of those who are lost and dying and headed to hell. We are the ONLY JESUS that some people will ever see.  We have the truth in our hearts because we have been given the truth. We must tell people around us what the bible says about Gods love and His desire to set them free from the bondages of sin and death.  We can not do that effectively if we appear to be just as sick and in bondage as the next person.  Can we?    We need to figure out how to get past the quest for more and more knowledge and information and get to the point where we can live what we know.  When we can figure out how to encourage one another, love one another, rebuke one another, speak truth into one another's lives then we will be able to have restoration, healing and integrity in our own lives.   I would love to talk about some "real" stuff that keeps us prisoners to sin and defeat. How can we put our faith into action and make a "real" difference?    God loves you so much that He made the ultimate sacrifice. Today He stands ready with open arms to heal us and restore us and give us the power we need to live and lead in a fallen world.    In His Name James Moffitt

       We have twelve days to move.  Our landlord informed us that his soon to be ex wife owns the rental property that we are in and that she needs to move in since they are separated now.  We cant really afford the house anyway and knew that we needed to move to something cheaper.  This is forcing us to do the move now instead of in October.  The search for a place to stay is in full swing.  Thus far everyone wants first and last month rent to move in.  My money tree is bare so that is not going to work for us.    We are having a moving sale and listing things on Iwanna.com to see if we can generate some extra income and lighten our moving load.  In August of 1997 we sold everything we owned and moved to Douglasville Georgia.  It took us almost 7 years to reaquire everything we sold.  I told Katy that this was the last time I am doing this.  No more working to acquire stuff that I am just going to have to sell anyway.    Our home phone is off and the cell phone and Internet connection will go next unless we can find the funds to pay the bills soon.  If that happens we should be back online within 4 to 6 weeks.  If you are reading this and we have your home phone number we will be in contact during that time to let you know how we are doing.    On the bright side of things Katy does have a job and I do have unemployment coming in until Feb of 2004.  Those two things keep us from being totally indigent.  PTL for that aye?    I know that we are not alone and that there are other folks that are in a pickle just like us.  All we know is that we need a rest from this constant barrage of life changing events. We are weary since everything seems to be happening all at the same time.  We need a break.    Come soon Lord Jesus come soon.  I think that this family is more than ready....

       Seven days and counting before we have to be out of Simpsonville.  We made arrangements to move within 10 minutes of Katy's job and she found out that they let her go yesterday.  The excuse for letting her go was that she was afraid of the patients and she was not taking the blood pressure readings to their liking.  Katy thinks that she was doing just fine and that one of the certified nursing assistants was talking trash about her to the boss.  Maybe the job just was not to be?  Atleast we have an almost full paycheck coming out of this fiasco on July 3rd which will help us tremendously.    On the positive side of things we will be living in cheaper accomodations and I will be able to afford them on what I get with unemployment and what I make at the flea market on the weekend.   Things will be extremely tight but that is better than being homeless or living in a motel for weeks on end.   When it rains it pours.  I wonder what is in store for us next??

       Ten days and counting.  That is how long it will be before we are moved out of Simpsonville SC to Travelers Rest SC.  We found a single wide trailer with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths to move into.  The landlord there was willing to work with us with regards to paying rent by the week and the deposit was low enough so that we could afford it.  We were starting to think that we would have to stay in a motel for 4 to 8 weeks while we found something that was affordable.  Now we dont have to worry about getting a storage place for our stuff.  Wahooooo!   We will be taking Justin and Kristina to Camp Happy Days on Sunday and then picking them back up the following Saturday.  We will be moved into our new location by the time we pick them up.  The kids decided that they liked the new digs which is cool.

       As the old saying goes "When it rains it pours". We have been experiencing a torrential down pour at our house with regards to the garbage that has been happening.    Tuesday afternoon Katy received a call from her work telling her that they were terminating her employment.  Katy lasted two weeks at this job and we both feel as if they did not give her a fair opportunity to address the "supposed" issues.  Katy did the same type of work at MUSC in Charleston without any problems.  We just paid the deposit on a single wide trailer that is 10 minutes from her job and now that job is gone.  Maybe we would not have found the trailer if it had not been for the job?    Yesterday, after we were done with the flea market Katy and the kids took the station wagon over to the new location in Travelers Rest to verify the power had been turned on and the turn on the AC.  Angel, our lab , got loose and was run over by a truck.  Angel is alive but she is not doing that great.  Katy and Kristina were pretty upset about the whole thing.  Angel is like one of the children and is very special to us.  I believe that Angel probably wont play "chicken" with anymore vehicles for some time to come.    Today is the day we take our children to Camp Happy Days for a one week stay.  Justin and Kristina have been counting the days and hours until this week.  I am glad they are actually going to get to go.  While they are gone we will be moving our stuff from Simpsonville out to Travelers Rest.  One positive about this new location is that it is out in the country and is in a very quiet location.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust has settled and we have been in our metal shoe box for three weeks.  As far as shoe boxes go this one is nice compared to the one we lived in when we lived in Acworth Georgia.  We lived in Red Barn Mobile Park and boy that was a dump and a half.  We were one of the few folks that had two cars with shiny paint and a telephone line with Internet connectivity.  You could here the people now.  Hey mister, what is that funny looking box in yer living room??  I wonder if the street names or towns that you live on have any reflection on your past or future?  When we lived in Simpsonville we lived on "Broken Past" street.  Now we live in Travelers Rest.  I have to say that WE certainly could use some REST and we fully qualify as TRAVELERS since we have moved over 20 times in the last 14 years.  Katy keeps saying that we are gypsies for Jesus.  I told someone the other day that we moved to Travelers Rest and they told me that we are in the dead center of "rednecksville".  Oh well, what else is new in the deep south?  Our lives seem to have stabilized somewhat.  We managed to get our utility bills paid up so that we could transfer our power and cable utilities to our new home.  We even managed to pay off MaBell and get our home phone turned back on.  Our rent is cheap enough now that we can manage it with my unemployment benefits.  We live in a very quiet and secluded neighborhood with one house and three trailers.  I hardly hear a peep out of any of the surrounding folks so that suits me just fine.  Peace and quiet is just what the doctor ordered for us.    July of 2003 finds me in a business partnership with a local business owner who has agreed to finance a new computer business venture. Primarily we are focusing on the sale and repair/upgrades of used and refurbished systems.  We are opening a cellular and computer store in the Fiesta Mexicana by the Civic Center on Cedar Lane in Greenville. I will be at the new store in the afternoon and evenings and still selling computers at the flea market on White Horse Road on Sat and Sunday. Katy may be learning how to sell cellular phones and accessories so we may be partners at the three tables at Whitehorse soon.   I am still looking for an IT job but thus far nothing has surfaced.  Katy is taking a small break but I am sure that sometime in July or August after the kids go back to school (public) that she will renew her job search.  Katy is fighting a staff infection and had a cyst that needed to be removed.    Our Angel (black lab) who got run over by a truck seems to have stabilized some.  Angel will never be the dog she once was.  She can barely walk because her right rear leg is messed up.  I miss being able to rough house with her and play.  Now it seems that all she can do is just lay around and watch everything going on around her.  In some ways this incident has sent us through flash backs of how Jessica changed as a child when she was diagnosed with cancer.  One day Jessica was a normal 8 year old girl and then before you know it she has blinding headaches and dizzy spells and winds up being diagnosed with a brain tumor.  Over 14 months we watched her change from being a healthy vibrant girl to being so sick she could not even hold up her head to eat.  Sigh.....    Sammy , our new resident puppy is quite the character.  Sammy is approximately 4 inches long, 3 inches high and weighs in at about half a pound.  You can not believe the energy this puppy has and how much noise he can generate.  Sammy is the gift that keeps on giving now that I think about it since we are trying to teach him how to go outside to do his business.  We should have named Sammy "Kujo" since he thinks he is a big dog and wants to attack anything that slightly resembles something bigger than himself.  A puppy with an attitude.    I am hoping that I can find someone that knows computers well enough that can work for me at the flea market on Sundays so that we can find a church to attend here in Travelers Rest.  It has been almost 3 months since we attended a church service or had regular fellowship with other believers.  We have our friends and extended family on the Internet but that just does not replace face to face contact with brothers and sisters in real life.  Katy and I have struggled on and off with the idea of trying to maintain some sort of relationship with other couples in real life but it seems that we keep failing miserably in that department.  I think that the biggest factor for this is that most folks are just not inclined to be outgoing people persons.  Most folks tend to want to stay to themselves and do not encourage much more than a superficial relationship at best.  People are willing to socialize for 10 or 15 minutes at church and maybe go out to eat afterwards but anything past that seems to be a huge struggle.  Maybe everyone is just too busy to develop relationships outside of their immediate families.  Sometimes Katy and I wonder if we are just so messed up that no one wants to have anything to do with us outside of the church atmosphere.  My doctor said I would be fine, he just did not say when.  :)  For those of you that DO know me you know what I just said and how I mean it.    This week will be spent putting together our new space that will be used as a computer warehouse for parts and a staging area where they will be worked on.  We have to move some steel shelving from one storage area to another and then I have to set up four computers in our new store front so we can begin to try and sell them there.  I will be there from 4pm until 9 pm Tuesday Wed and Thursday.  Katy will probably be there on Monday and Friday while my bowling leagues are going on.  The interesting and challenging thing about where we are going to sell the computers is that the area is predominantly Hispanic.  That means that I will be learning some Spanish so that I can communicate more effectively with the customers.  That ought to be fun....

       With my new found freedom from the flea market I now have the ability to play around with my Web Log format.  I have decided that the Yellow needs to GO and something new needs to take its place.  I also have an RSS feed that is available for your reading pleasure even though I am not quite sure EXACTLY how that will be a benefit to you.  I think that you have to have an RSS compliant reader to view it?  I know that Chris Pirillo over at Lockergnome has been pushing out a lot of information about this so maybe I need to revisit what Chris has been publishing about RSS feeds.  Hopefully my blog will now show up using my new template and the YeLlOw background will be gone.  :)

       My, how the time flies when you are having fun.  August 2nd is upon us and on Tuesday the two year anniversary of Jessica passing will be here.  It seems almost as if it was yesterday that I was pushing her around in her wheel chair.    My business venture ended quite suddenly yesterday afternoon.  I decided that I did not need to be a part of the ongoing soap opera that was swirling around and causing more problems than it was worth.  It is apparent to me that selling computers (used or new) is not a good way to make ends meet.  I was pulling in between 20.00 and 50.00 every weekend after I got involved in this business venture so when you consider all the hours I have to put in to get to the point on the weekend to sell it just is not worth it.  I would be better off making minimum wage washing dishes for 8 hours per day.    I got a lead from my friend in Charleston about some positions possibly coming open at the AFB there.  My resume is on its way and hopefully I will be contacted for a telephone interview.  Katy interviewed twice with a health care provider that specializes in juveniles with criminal records and mental health problems.  If they like her references and she passes their background check then hopefully she will get a job offer next week.    Angel , our black lab, is doing much better and can move around more. Just the other day she was out in the yard trying to play with one of her toy balls.  Angel is not very tolerant of Sammy, our new puppy though.  Sammy seems to think that Angel is his play toy and wont leave her alone.  Pumpkin the orange cat made his appearance back into our lives after the rescue party went back to Simpsonville to search for him.  So, we have three people, 3 birds, two dogs and one cat in our metal shoe box.  Can you tell that I am not fond of living in a single wide trailer?  I think that when my parents were in the military that they lived in a trailer when I was younger and maybe I had some bad experiences that have caused this.  The important thing for me to remember is that our family DOES have a safe place to live and we are out in the country where it is nice and PEACEFUL.... I do thank God for that every day.    It has rained so much in SC that we are experiencing floods.  Most of the floods are in downtown Greenville and areas that have low lying areas with paved roads that cant handle the sudden influx of water that has been dumped on us during the last six weeks.  Where we live we just have mud puddles since our drive way is not paved.  The saying "you know you must be a red neck if instructions to your house includes turn off the paved road."  Actually, it is not quite that bad.  We do have a paved road in front of our lot which is something we did not have in Goose Creek (aka duck ditch USA).  When it rained buckets there we had a pond by our drive way that we could have stocked with gold fish....  This next week will find me searching for ANY type of job that I can find.  I have two weeks left on unemployment benefits and I MIGHT be qualified for an additional 13 weeks after that runs out.  Nevertheless we NEED to increase our income past the poverty mark somehow.  Maybe I need to just give up on my chosen field and just wash dishes for a while?  I cant wash dishes because that would give me dish pan hands and then what would the guys say about me?  LOL.... What guys and who cares anyway?  My creditors and utility companies care, that is who cares....  Now that I have regained my weekends and I will no longer be hoping for flea market sales we will be able to start going back to church on Sunday.  I have decided that we will be searching Travelers Rest for the church of our dreams.  hahahahahah  Ok, I guess that I dont really dream about churches since we ARE part of THE church.  The body of Christ includes you and I IF we are a disciple of Christ.  The buildings that we go to in order to gather with other believers is also known as the local church or congregation.  Is there such a thing as a perfect church?  Of course not, especially if we are a part of it.  Nevertheless we need to find a local body of believers that we can become a part of.  Maybe that will help us as we go through the tough times of unemployment and being new in this community.

       Today Hal Eads passed from this life into eternity to be with his Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  Hal trusted Christ as his personal saviour and while we will miss Hal we know and trust that we will see him again one day.  Hal was one of Katy's older brothers.  I believe that he was 48 years old.  I only met Hal one or two times in the 13 years that Katy and I have been married but he seemed to be a very quiet and layed back type of person.  Hal was very nice towards me and very likeable. On serveral occasions Hal helped our family out when we needed it.  I know that Katy misses her brother and we are hoping we can make the trip to Corpus Christi for the memorial service.  Hal was born December 19, 1954 and passed on at age 48 August 7, 2003.  We love you Hal and miss you!

       We spent two hours at the Job fair yesterday at the Palmetto Expo Center in Greenville.  According to the evening news there were over 8000 people who attended.  We spent several hours standing in one line after the other to hand out our resume, pick up applications and talk to recruiters.  There seemed to be several types of employers present.  Health Care, Cellular Retailers, Financial Advisor sales , Restaurant Management, Fast food establishments.    It seems as if Charter Communications (Cable provider) is going to be hiring 38 people for their call center soon. After you go through Man Power Temps and work for Charter for 8 to 12 weeks as a temp then they put you on full time as a Charter employee.  Katy and I both have applied for these positions and are doing what we can to follow up with them via phone and email.  The boys home Katy applied to is having problems with their phone lines so they have not gotten the reference checks done yet.  We are hopeful that once that happens Katy will get a job offer.    Today we went back to the envelope method of budgeting.  One envelope for rent, one for gas, one for.... You get the picture.  For now we are putting our checking account on hold.  Thanks to the account being in  RED  status there is not much we can do other than go to the envelope method of budeting and paying bills.    Our needs are being met.  Food, clothing, roof over our heads are taken care of.  Sometimes the needs are being met in the last moment but then again our timing is subjective and Gods timing is perfect.  One of the lessons we are learning through all of this is that our perception of what a  NEED  is vs a  WANT  has become much clearer.  We know that compared to the rest of the worlds population we are probably filthy rich.  When you make a five and six figure income you are accustomed to  THINGS  which take the shape of  physical objects  as well as  activities  that cost money to do.    We are learning the hard way how to be more frugal.  I am hopeful that we will be able to kill the cell phones and keep the Internet connection so that we can stay in touch with our extended family here on line.  Nevertheless if it has to go it will be gone.  :(  Signing off for now.  Stay tuned for more to come!

      Today was spent by beginning a new job search which began at the South Carolina Unemployment Commission.  I found out about an entry level quality assurance position with a company in Simpsonville.  Hey, didn't we just move from Simpsonville?  I filled out the application and got set up for an interview on Wed at 9:15 am.  Hopefully my resume wont scare them off and hopefully they will offer me a job.  I figure that 9.00 per hour is better than 7.50 on unemployment benefits any day of the week.    I also went by the TATE TEMPORARIES in downtown Greenville and filled out an application.  They apparently have some clerical work that I might be able to do on a temporary basis.  Ya never know....  I found out this weekend that Walmart also has a phone number you can call and apply for a job online.  I also went by Kinkos by Haywood Mall area and got my resume and cover letter copied onto resume quality paper.    Now, I am going to Mauldin SC to bowl in my Monday night league.  I think we are in fourth or fifth place and we have one or two more weeks to bowl and then this league will be over.

       Do you have a Web Log?  I bet you do and I do not know about it. If you do not have one, why not?  Maybe you think that I am a little weird by posting my thoughts and daily/weekly/monthly updates for anyone to read.  If you think I am a little weird you are probably not too far off base.  My doctor says that I will be fine, he just did not say when.  :)  Why do I keep this BLOG rolling you wonder?  One reason I do this is so that people that are friends and family can keep up to date with our status.  Its pretty easy actually.  When I get in the mood to drivel I fire up w.blogger v 3.01 on my computer at home and I start banging at the keyboard.  Once I am done I can post and publish to my web log with one click of the mouse.  The second reason that I do this is because writing helps me to sort out my thoughts and bring order to my life.  I guess that writing helps me to reflect on the events of the day or week and helps me to view my attitudes , focus and journey in such a way that I can learn and hopefully share with other people.    Why is it important to share our innermost thoughts, feelings, hopes, fears and dreams with the common Joe?  Have you ever felt as if you were not talented or that even though you enjoyed something immensely you did not think that what you did would benefit someone else?  That is how I felt about my writing.  I have been writing short stories and ministry related articles online for approximately 9 years.  One day I told an editor friend that even though I enjoy writing I felt that no one else would want to read it.  I did not feel worthy of anyone else getting something out of my writing.  I was reminded that people need to see the essence of who I am EVEN if I am a common Joe.  I am a real person living in a real world with real problems just like you. How I perceive those problems , address those problems and solve those problems are unique to me and the life of my family.  When I share my life journey and that of my family through my writing I am showing other common Joe's that their life is not that much different than mine and that they too can have hope.  My desire is to share the HOPE that lives within me.  That HOPE is Jesus Christ.  Without Christ there is NO HOPE.  Without Christ there is what the world offers and that is helplessness, pain, despair and depression.  When Christ is at the center of your world there is HOPE, PEACE, LOVE and JOY.  No matter how small of a JOE I or YOU might be the world needs to hear about the HOPE that lives within us and gives us the power to overcome the world in a REAL way.    You might be thinking at this point that you need to be a published author in order to do online journaling or blogging. All you need is the desire to put your thoughts and feelings into words and publish them to your own web log or journal.  How well you write is not anywhere near as important as the essence of your journey.  Yes, in order to be published and to earn money with your writing there will be 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  Being a published writer may or may not happen for you but when that time comes you will know it.  Until then just practice writing and get better at it.  In the mean time you can just focus on telling the world about the Jesus in you.

      Our journey started out this last Wednesday at 2pm after dropping off our hairy family members in Easley SC.  (Angel and Sammy the Moffitt mutts for those of you that are wondering what in the world I am talking about).  I drove until midnight Wed night which landed us in Vicksburg Mississippi.  I spent 45 min between Clinton MS and Vicksburg trying to find a Motel that would honor the coupons you find in the Traveler Lodge publication that is located at Shoney's and other participating retailers.  I found out the hard way that those coupons are useless at 11 pm at night and they use the catch phrase "upon availability" to get out of honoring the coupons.  I finally found a Motel 8 that let us stay for 44.00 for the night.  That was 10.00 cheaper than most places at that time of the night.    We arrived in Garland Texas at approximately 3pm on Thursday afternoon and spent several hours running between Terrell Texas and Quinlan Texas visiting my aunts and uncles before heading over to Garland Texas where Katy's college room mate lives.    My uncle Carl is in a hospital in Terrell Texas.  He was in a car accident several months ago which left him with an internal head injury (trauma) which has scrambled what little brain function he had left.  Uncle Carl has fallen several times at home, broke a hip and suffered some pretty bad bruises.  When I saw him in the hospital they had him restrained so that he can not get out of bed.  From what I can tell he needed to be restraied.  It was hard for me to see my uncle at th age of 76 years old being in this type of shape.  The last memories I had of him he was getting older and not so physically active but atleast he had his mental capacity left.  I guess those days are over.   One of my aunts who is married to Uncle Carl is in her 70's and even though I recognize her voice I had a shock to see her physically.  I also have an aunt in Quinlan that is 80 years old and she seems to be getting along better than can be expected considering her age.   We spent the night Thursday night at Jack and Paula Bush's residence in Garland and had a wonderful time swimming in their pool and enjoying all around great hospitality.  Katy and Paula had a blast talking about their college dormitory memories.  Paula has two girls who are close to the ages of Kristina and Justin so they bonded immediatly and had a blast.   We drove from Garland Texas at 2 pm on Friday and stopped by Pleasanton Texas which is just outside of Corpus Christi (by 90 min) and visited with Melody who is one of Katy's Circle of Friends elist members.  We spent 45 minutes there so Katy and Melody could bond and then hit the road again.  We arrived in Robstown Tx around 11pm Friday night and spent the night there and went to the memorial service at 10 am at a Methodist church called Isle of the Son on South Padre Island.    The memorial service went well and I was pleased to hear that the service was used not only to celebrate the life of Hal Eads and his accomplishments but it was also a time where Hal's relationship with Christ was highlighted in a very positive way.  Hal may be absent in body but because of his relationship with his Lord and Saviour Hal is present with Christ in glory.    The memorial service was nice and a full multimedia presentation with a power point slide and accompanying music helped to focus our minds on our own mortality and our final resting place.    The afternoon was spent on Saturday at Pat and Jackie Mosmeyer's home in Port Aransas Texas which is south of South Padre Island and Corpus Christi Texas.  Much food and drink was consumed and stories shared about the life and times of Hal Eads.    Tomorrow is Sunday and we will depart Robstown Texas and head to Houston Texas where I will be visiting with my son Jeremy who is now a Senior in High School in the Richmond Rosenburg area just outside of Houston.  It is hard to believe that Jeremy is 17 years old and almost out of high school.    The trip thus far has been relatively uneventful other than the miles and miles of endless highway.  Our car has held up pretty good other than having some minor tire issues but that can happen to anyone on such a long trip as this one.  Thanks to our church family in Goose Creek we were able to make this trip to begin with.       James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt jcmoffitt@charter.net

      First there was  Will & Grace , now  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  and  Nip & Tuck .  Prime Time Television is being invaded by special interest groups in a big way.  I just spent 10 minutes reviewing Nip & Tuck and I have to say that I was absolutely amazed at how  blatant  the portrayal of sexuality and homosexuality.     It is apparent to me that prime time Television is a MAJOR vehicle for brainwashing unsuspecting Americans into believing that ALL of this is something that we should just tolerate.  Why in the world IS IT important for me to  TOLERATE sin  and embrace it to the point that I invite it into my home and teach it to my family?  If I sit in front of the television and passively watch the garbage and I do not make a stand for righteousness by turning away from it then I am embracing and endorsing the content.  If I am passive and say nothing and allow my family to view this type of garbage then I am teaching them that it is OK to tolerate sin.     Tolerance  and  diversity  are the catalysts for the diseases of this world that are destroying the moral fabric of our society and damaging the family unit as we know it.  Just in case you need a definition for the biblical family unit it exists of hetrosexual  MALE  and  FEMALE  united under the laws of nature and Gods word as husband and wife.  This type of marriage before God and man is what produces the offspring that we call children.  Two people of the same sex can not have children yet there are same sex partners that insist on the same privileges and protection under our laws.  Same sex partners want to adopt children so that they can appear to be the normal family when they are not. When we say things and do things that are the counterfeit of that which is natural or righteous then we are deceiving ourselves and others.  The fruit of the spirit does not provide us with examples of deception.  Only the fruit of darkness provides us with the counterfeit fruit of sin.     Yes, I am conservative.  Yes, I believe that Gods word , written in the bible is truth.  No, I do not believe that God approves of SIN.  Homosexuality IS SIN just as idolatry, lying, stealing, fornication, adultery and any other sin you can think of is labeled as sin.  If we do anything that separates us from a relationship with God that is considered sin.  If we love something MORE than we love God that is considered sin.  Here is what the book of Galatians has to say about sin.     Gal 5:19  The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;  Gal 5:20  idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions  Gal 5:21  and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.  Gal 5:22  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,  Gal 5:23  gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.      I believe that we are to embrace the person and love them just as God would love them.  That does NOT mean that I am to embrace , support or encourage sinful habits or addictions.     Gal 6:1  Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.  Gal 6:2  Carry each others burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.     We would like to believe that our righteousness and our love for God and His word and the world around us is going to effect permanent change.  The problem is that the world is going to hell in a hand basket all around us and it is happening because good men remain silent and passive.  When that happens evil prevails.  We have to identify sin and the effects of that sin on our people and the world they live in.  Then we need to draw a line in the sand and call other men and women to stand up for holiness and Gods word.  We need to do everything in our power to effect permanent change in our communities through our actions and not just our lip service.  We need to quit fooling ourselves into thinking that the church down the street or the clergy is going to get the job done.    If these words are wooing you into an intellectual comfort zone then please do yourself a favor and bang your head on your desk several times until it hurts.  If you are a disciple of Christ then what I am saying here really is old news.  I am not the first person to sound the alarm and incite people to action.  The question is this.  Do we believe what we believe to the point that we are willing to sacrifice those things that make up our comfort zones?  Are we willing to give up everything that stands in the way of affecting positive and permanent change in our community?

      Do you remember the story about the man that was on top of his house during a major flood?  As the story progresses the man exhibits great faith at first and then foolishness.  On several occasions while the man was praying for help God sent him a way to be rescued.  I don't remember all of the story but I know that a boat came by and then lastly a helicopter.  The man rejected the help and told them that he had faith that God was going to save him.  The man winds up drowning and asked God why his faith failed him and God did not save him.  What about the boat filled with rescuers or the helicopter?  I liken our story to the man on top of the house with the flood waters rising and our having faith that while things look bleak that God is going to provide us with the help we need.  This weekend a boat came by and I want to thank the Lord for having enough sense to recognize it for what it was.    We spent the weekend in Goose Creek with our former pastor and his family.  We went to Grace Fellowship Church on Sunday.  The church not only is assisting us with funds for gas money so we can make the trip to Texas but they also are planning on renting a Uhaul truck and sending some of the men to Travelers Rest at the end of this month to pack us up and move us back.  Ok, so maybe it is not a boat bur more a Uhaul Truck.  I am not picky in the least.  :)  I was pleasantly surprised to hear the pastor tell me of his plans to move us back. I asked Pastor Tom WHY they were willing to help us.  He looked at me and said,  "You are a part of our family aren't you?"  Wow, that is incredible.  We are a part of that family and have been for the last 3 years. On several occasions Pastor Tom, his family and Grace Fellowship Church helped our family as we were walking through the trials of Jessica's fight with cancer.  Without them our situation would have been much worse.   There were several things that had to happen BEFORE this plan was implemented.  The church finance committee had to agree to it and I had to find a place to live.  Both of those pieces fell in place this weekend.  The funds were approved and I spoke to our former landlord and friend in Goose Creek and it just happens that our old residence at 159 Mapleridge Drive is coming available on August 23rd.  Imagine that huh?  My former landlord understands our situation and is willing to help us in whatever way that he can.  Can you say Praise the Lord??  I am....  Thank you Jesus for working out the details and for friends and a church family that loves us and is willing to reach out and help our family.    I had no idea that the pastor was planning this and thusly it was a very nice surprise.  We like Travelers Rest but we do not like the unemployment with no job prospects in sight.  I looked at the classifieds this weekend in Charleston and it appears that there are quite a few more options there than here.  I also know of several IT positions that are coming available on the AFB there so I am hoping that one of those positions will have my name on it.    Pastor Tom has also approached me about taking lead with regards to the mens ministry at Grace Fellowship.  This has also surprised me as well.  I am humbled that Pastor Tom would entrust this to me and I am going to look forward to this challenge.  Grace Fellowship is a small congregation but I believe that there is a TON of potential there as the congregation grows in size.  From what I was told this weekend they now have 18 youth in a very active and growing youth ministry there which is awesome!  The church is also undergoing some major building renovations this year and we are hoping that taking out the old and making brand new will help with regards to retaining new members when they come in the doors on Sunday. More importantly though I am hopeful that as people continue to come through the church doors at Grace Fellowship that they will encounter the same love and acceptance that our family experienced and are still being shown.   We are planning to head towards Texas early Thursday morning.  We should have just enough gas money and we will be praying that our car does not break down on the trip.  It has been 3 years since we have visited friends and family in Texas and Katy wants to make the memorial service in Corpus on Saturday. I miss seeing my 17 year old son Jeremy who lives in Rosenburg which is just outside of Houston so I am hopeful to see him as well.    Thank you, our faithful friends and prayer partners who have lifted us up as a family as we have walked down the road of life in the last two years.  Your faithful prayers and support have helped us in ways that you will not understand this side of heaven.  We are so grateful for your help.  I know that moving AGAIN is going to be a huge hassle but I am looking at this opportunity as a HUGE blessing and a chance to get plugged in to a community of people that we are familiar with and hopefully we will be in a better place to serve God and find full time employment so we can meet financial responsibilities that have had to take a back seat while we have been struggling.   God bless

      Good morning folks!  Have you heard of RSS yet?  If not, you will be.  Maybe this is the first time you have heard of Really Simple Syndication.  Thanks to my subscription to Lockergnome I have been learning about it myself.    Do you get published newsletters through e-mail?  I get quite a few of them.  Thanks to the world of spammers that are filling up our inboxes with a deluge of garbage that we did not ask for ISP's are implementing "filters" that STOP HTML formatted newsletters from being sent through their e-mail servers.  The positive aspect of this happening is that it STOPS some SPAM that is in the form of HTML.  There are several e-mail formats but one that has become dangerous is the HTML format that allows the e-mail to look and feel like a web page.  Advertisers like to use that format because it is pretty and gets our attention with all of the widgets and gizmos that can be coded into the HTML content.  The UGLY side to the HTML format is that hackers and virus code writers have found ways to put destructive payloads in the HTML code and therefore use that format to send out viruses.    Lockergnome is beginning to phase out their e-mail newsletter and replace their content with RSS feeds.  Here is a link to what I am talking about with regards to Lockergnome.  http://rss.lockergnome.com/  On the right panel you will find links to  FREE RSS News Aggregators . If you are familiar with Usenet and the USENET Newsgroups you will find  RSS NEWS READERS  to be easy to use.  Usenet newsreaders allow you to read published usenet newsgroups as well as respond to the posts online.   Also on the right panel you will find the new  RSS feeds for Lockergnome .  Once you have the RSS reader of choice installed on your computer you can click on the RSS feed you are interested in and cut and paste that url into your RSS reader as a NEW FEED that you want to stay updated on.  Yes, there is a bit of a learning curve here but it is worth it.    I know that some of you are probably rolling your eyes wondering what in the world I am babbling about.  :)  RSS or  Really Simple Syndication  provides those that  publish content  a new and safe environment to do so that is  FREE of ISP filters  and it provides folks like us an automated way to receive the  RSS feeds  with the information we  DO WANT  free of viruses and spam.  Does THAT interest you?  Who needs or wants more spam?  I know I do not.   Using current technology if you do not want to have your inbox polluted with  HTML email newletters  you opted to go to the website and read at your leisure.  If you have multiple newsletters you like to read that could be time consuming.  Now , as publishers catch on and start formatting their content in XML and then create RSS feeds you can just plug that content into the RSS reader of choice.   Here is a for instance.  Have you been following the  Moffitt Web Log  or BLOG?  There are two ways to get our BLOG.    http://jcmoffitt.blogspot.com  ------>  web browser  reads this content  OR  http://jcmoffitt.blogspot.com/rss/jcmoffitt.xml------> requires  RSS Reader    OR  I can  e-mail you a copy  of each new blog as I am sent the copy every time I post.    When you click on the  RSS feed  above all you see is xml content which looks like gibberish in your  web browser .  You have to have a  RSS Reader  that can interpret xml. Ok, I have given you enough information to either confuse you or peak your interest.  I hope it did the latter.   Click through the information on Lockergnome.  Chris does a much better job of EXPLAINING how RSS works since he knows a lot more about it.  :)   Email me at jcmoffitt@charter.net if you have any specific HOW TO questions and I will help you all I can.

       My, how times flies when you are having fun.  It seems as if we just got back from our trip to Texas back on last Tuesday.  Now it is Saturday afternoon and I am sitting here writing to you about our trip to Goose Creek SC.  Loading the truck only claimed two victims and a couple of scratches for two people.  No major injuries and we only damaged two pieces of furniture.  The joys of moving a lot is that ultimately things are going to get torn up no matter how hard you try to keep it from happening.  The trip between Travelers Rest and Goose Creek was uneventful and it was not until we landed in Goose Creek around 9pm that things got fun.  I took the UHaul truck to the UHaul center to off load the car carrier. There was not enough space in the main parking lot for me to turn the truck around while pulling the car carrier.  What to my wandering eyes appeared but a field behind the main parking lot.  At first glance things looked dry and I also found several trailers parked in the field. I deducted that it was safe to drive the 26' truck off into the field so I could turn it around.  What I should have done was put the truck in park and walked into the field myself to VERIFY that it was indeed safe to do so.  For a fleeting moment my brain told me to question my assumption but you know what folks say about assumptions.    It took me approximately 35 seconds to leave the concrete and come to a complete stop while the truck was still in drive and trying to go forward.  I tried and tried to rock the truck forward and backward thinking I could disengage it from the soft mud that I encountered.  They say that the road to perdition is paved with good intentions but no matter how many good intentions that I may have had the truck was going no where.  By this time I had several on lookers who happened to be at the Goose Creek EMS next door.  I think that they probably had bets as to how quickly I would get the truck stuck in the mud.  I would also believe that they probably have a wall in their garage that has a mark for every time a Uhaul driver has gotten a truck stuck in that very same field.    It is one thing to make a stupid mistake but something entirely different to have to broadcast it to friends or family when you call for help.  They always say  "You did what?  What in the world were you thinking James?"  Thanks be unto good manners the laughter was kept to a minimum and my friend , Paul Bunyon, and several EMS workers used a Chevy 4x4 and a chain and pulled the truck out of the mud.  I know that you are wondering about who Paul Bunyon is.  I want to give him credit for helping me but in order to finish the next paragraph I have to protect his true identity so that I can finish this story.  Paul Bunyon , my tree felling friend, is an integral part of this story.   We spent the night at the Pastors house and got some much needed rest for all of the sore and aching body parts.  Thanks to the help of about 10 people from church we had the truck unloaded in approximately 1 hour.  I am so thankful for the help and assistance that we have received from our friends and church family.    Daniel Boone was a man he was a BIG Man.....  Oh, I am sorry, I wandered a bit.  I was supposed to tell you about my friend , Paul Bunyon, the great outdoorsman, a REAL man.  Paul Bunyon IS a REAL MAN.  I am not kidding.  This guy can work from sun up to sun down and there is almost NOTHING that this guy can not do with his bare hands.  Ok, ok, maybe I am exagerrating a bit.  Sometimes he does need to use tools.  Can we say power tools?  Tim the tool man would be jealous of Paul's prowess with power tools.    Today is no different than most days with regards to my memory of how talented my friend Paul is with regards to his strength, agility and endurance.  Not only did he help unload the 26' truck he also hauled all the trash out of our yard into a large burn pile.  Paul Bunyon then proceeds to fire up the chain saw and started cutting down trees out of the neighbors yard in preparation for moving out an older trailer and making room for a more new improved and newer LARGER trailer.  I KNOW that the lady in the shoe box across the street will be absolutely thrilled but that is a whole different story.    I  know, I chase too many rabbits in my writing but I know that it probably keeps you on your toes.  Why make writing dull and boring anyway?  Lest I digress lets get back to why the power tools and Paul Bunyon are so important to this story.  Just as I did not MEAN to bury the truck in mud my friend Paul did not MEAN to cut down the tree and certainly did not expect the tree to take out the power on our entire street.  Did you ever wonder how to get all your neighbors out into the street all at the same time?  Try killing the power on your street and you will have more friends than you would ever want.    When the power went off I was under my desk amidst all of the different power cords and connectors that have to be plugged in to get all of my computer toys functional again.  There are three things that happen first when it comes to getting the household functional after first moving in.  Katy works on the kitchen (food) and food making utensils.  The computer network and all the essentials for getting online fast. (Must have access) and the stereo equipment comes next.  We must have tunes.  If we have food, Internet Access and tunes we can survive anything.  Well, anything but friends with a hankering to cut down trees in the middle of the day with their power tools.

       It appears that when you "change" the settings in your BLOG that you have to POST something NEW before the changes show up.  So, here is a little bit of drivel to see if the changes took place.

       We landed back in Travelers Rest on Tuesday August 19th fully one day BEFORE we had intended to arrive. When I get the bug to get somewhere I usually do just that.  I drag my family kicking and screaming into our automobile , lash them in and put the gas pedal to the floor board.  We left Houston Texas at 9 am on Monday and spent the night in Birmingham Alabama.  We left Tuesday morning at 8 am and only stopped long enough for breakfast.  We dropped out of warp drive at approximately 3 pm when we stopped in our driveway.    There is no rest for the weary (wicked?) so we got a good nights rest in our FAVORITE King sized bed and then the fun began this morning. Our metal shoe box is starting to look like a card board box factory.  I will be retrieving the Uhaul truck and car transport Friday morning and then my fun will begin as I transfer our junk from the shoe box to a metal shoe box on wheels.  Gosh, you would think that I have a shoe box fetish with as many times as I use that as an allegory to describe where we live.  I guess I just hate the sound of trailer or mobile home because I get images of funnel clouds coming out of the sky looking for the nearest "trailer park".    I called Ma Bell today and they are moving our telephone service as of this Friday.  I am wondering if those of you who are reading this will KNOW how to find out what our new number is going to be WITHOUT writing me an e-mail and asking me for it.   .  (That stands for VERY evil Grin).  Since MaBell is pushing DSL in our old neighborhood and everything is FREE to try it I said "WHY NOT"  we are Happily Addicted to the WEB anyway....  So, by September 4th we should receive our DSL start up package and I will hopefully be able to install the DSL modem and get online with very FEW complications.  For those of you on my e-mail distribution list you will get my new e-mail address when it is confirmed.    Oh, yes, I will give you a HINT with regards to finding our new phone number that will be turned on this Friday.  Two letters are IM.  That is all you will get so happy digging.  heheheheheh  I have digital pictures on a digital camera but the serial cable that hooks the camera to my computer is MIA.  It does not help that most of our stuff is now in boxes so I guess the picture transfer and www.fototime.com album additions will just have to wait until we get moved an unpacked.  I will try to do a blog and add some pictures that we took when we visited with our friends and family.    Ok, enough babbling, hope you have a great day !

      I am a subscriber of LOOK Yahoo Group (stands for Loss of our Kids I think).  Most of the time I just read but do not participate too much because it seems that mostly the women are doing all of the talking. That could be because we just don't have that many men OR the men that are there are playing the silent game.  So, with that in mind I have been posting a little bit more in the hopes of engaging in some conversation about life in general much less our LOOK topics.  I wrote the following post just now and thought it was good for me to add it to my blog for a gentle reminder to myself and others that might need to hear it too.  ______________________________  Prayers can NEVER hurt any of us.  Sometimes those prayers are the only thing that holds us up as we are wallowing in the funk of life. When we are weak that is when HE is strong.  When we are full of pride and think that we can handle the issues of life all by our little lonesome then perhaps HE is not so near.    I am thankful for God's sustaining grace and for the extended family of Christ that has reached out to my family in the last two years. One of the things that I have been learning as we walk through the valley of the shadow of unemployment and the continuing instability is that God is still alive and He is more faithful to His word and promises than I am.  I am also learning the value of living in the meantime and sharpening my ability to be content no matter what position I find myself.    I am not sure that the word "Happy" is one that truly reflects how I "feel".  Thanks to our being busy with the trip to Texas and our impending move I have been able to focus on other things than our situation which still remains bleak.  I know that I need to focus on those things that I can change and leave the things I can not change to God.  One thing that I can change and I always need to work on is my attitude towards life, family and those around me.   We need a safe journey from Travelers Rest to Goose Creek without any major problems. We need to get settled back in our old house and then Katy and I need to find some type of employment before my next 12 weeks of unemployment runs out. I am sure that being in a familiar town with familiar people and being back at our old church home will make the trials of the weeks to come much easier to deal with.

       During my foray into the world of RSS yesterday I ran across many new RSS feeds.  One of those feeds led me to  urlLink Blogs for God, a semi definitive listing of Christ centered blogs or journals   I registered our BLOG and RSS feed and I received the e-mail this morning that our(my) blog had been added to their index.  Thanks so much for doing this Dean.    Yesterday I managed to break away from Cyberworld long enough to make a trip to the Berkeley County Solid Waste (DUMP) facility to get rid of moving boxes and assorted trash left by the former residents here.  I also found a new appreciation for my wife's station wagon's air conditioner.  When we moved from Greenville SC back to Duck Ditch USA (Goose Creek) it was painfully obvious to me that it is almost 5 to 10 degrees cooler in the upstate.  That must be because we are closer to the mountains there.  Maybe the elevation is higher?  I do know that the humidity here is stifling compared to there.    This marks day 7 back home.  We are still underemployed and over appreciated.  Slowly but surely the junk is coming out of the boxes and being put in its appropriate places.  This time around we are minus our 32" TV, cable TV , washer and dryer.  The TV and cable connection is something we are going to learn to do without.  I miss the ability to watch TV when I am eating dinner.  I also miss late night TV which was used from time to time to help me to get to sleep on those nights where I was wide awake while everyone in the house was passed out.   The sad thing about cable TV is that everything on it with regards to movies and the like I have already seen.  How many waking moments in my life have I wasted watching the stuff that Hollywood has produced for centuries.  The answer to that question is too many.  God has given each of us minds filled with the desire to acquire knowledge and to be inquisitive about our surroundings and environment.  Somehow we have lulled ourselves to sleep mentally with the multitude of entertainment options in our world.  Everywhere you turn there is input.  Do you remember the movie Short Circuit?  Johnny 5 being ALIVE.  More input, more input he cried as he devoured hours and hours of TV programming and absorbed all the history and information that provided him.    Is TV sort of like a live LOG of human history perhaps?  It certainly reflects human nature and the decline of morality through the centuries.   Johnny 5 (robot in movie) was always afraid of any attempt to DISASSEMBLE.  Thinking back on the movie and on how information can be both positive and negative I am wondering if we have been allowing the garbage from Hollywood to slowly disassemble us mentally and spiritually.  For some reason television fills the role of allowing us to open up our minds and let go of the controls to what we allow to enter in. No, I do not feel that TV in and of itself is inherently evil or that it has supernatural abilities to control our minds.  I do feel that we has humans have an uncanny desire to be entertained.  We need to escape from the realities of this life and so we allow the boob tube to lull us into a false feeling of freedom and fantasy.    No sooner had we settled into our former residence Cable TV reared his ugly head in the shape of shared cable with our neighbor.  Was I tempted to take the innocent black cable from my neighbor and run it through the window and attach it to my 13" (cough) black TV with no remote.  Heck, I could atleast watch Jay Leno at night as I allowed my body and mind to be lulled into the world of sleepiness.  Surprisingly enough for me I managed to remind myself that I would be stealing cable and not sharing it and that I need to be doing more constructive things with my mind than being lulled to a stupor by the television.   The down side of no television is that you are insulated and shielded from all the droning of all those marketing schemes called commercials and all the news broadcasts from around the world.  Now that I think of that it is really not that bad.  I can now choose to fill my time and my mind and spirit with OTHER things.  I can choose to pursue knowledge and wisdom through reading of my bible, bible commentaries and listening to Christian radio.    The problem with time for us humans is that the hour glass that God has running for each of us is doing one thing each day.  Time is slowly but surely running out.  One day that sand will finally reach the end.  The sand that was at the top will have filtered through to the bottom and time we end for us as we know it.  Then we will be face to face with the God that created us and our lives will be a story that can be read through eternity.  Our lives are but a vapor according to the bible.  In Ecclesisastes we read that everything has its season and God has given man a "season" to live in.  It is up to us to do something positive and constructive with our lives during this season.  God gave us life and grace because He created us and loves us with a love that is everlasting.  We can never earn that grace or love.  We can however use what God has given us and give it back to Him with seasons of time in which we pursue our relationship with Him and use what He gives us back to the community of people that He has placed us in.   How many people are prisoners in their own mind ?  How many people has Hollywood captured? How many people are drowning in their daily entertainment shielded with a false hope and false security from the world full of dying people all around them?  When we choose to substitute God for the things of this world we are short circuiting Gods perfect will and plan for our lives.  We are more than just innocent microbes with no purpose other than to eat, drink , sleep and reproduce.  We are creatures that are made in His image.  We were designed to praise and worship our creator and to love him.  We were created to bring pleasure to God Almighty through our devotion and love for Him and appreciation for His gifts to us.    Is it time for you and I to short circuit the controls that this world has on our lives and to refocus what we allow to enter into our minds and spirits?  Instead of pursuing to be entertained and living in a fantasy world that gives us temporary relief we should instead be pursuing the truth.  The problem with truth is that most of the time it really hurts.  Truth usually clears up all of the cloudy interference in our minds and gives us a clear reflection of who we are.  The problem with truth is it always brings us to a point of making a decision.  Decisions mean choices.  A choice to change directions, attitudes and desires. When we are face to face with truth will we make the right choices?  Most of the time when we make the right choice it will not be easy or a popular decision.  In the book of Joshua we remember the cry of "choose you this day whom you will serve".  What God are we serving anyway?  Is God compartementalized in our lives and we only give him a tiny portion of our time, energy and resources?  If we only give God a tiny portion of our minds, hearts, spirit, gifts and talents what does that say about our devotion and love for Him?  Do we love God this much as we spread out our arms signifying total surrender or do we have our arms wrapped around ourselves because we love ourselves and the things of this world so much that we can let go?  Are we imprisoned by our own inability to let go and let God?    It is time that we short circuit the things in our world that are keeping us from being who God wants us to be.  It is time for us to make decisions and choices that will not only redefine who we are but it will also redefine and change who the world is around us.  When we learn how to redefine what makes us happy and what is important to us we will then be able to receive the full glory of God in our lives and be the containers of love, truth, mercy and grace that others in our lives will be able to turn to.  The Bible says that we are to be separate from this world and not of this world.  Be Ye Holy for I am Holy says the Lord God Almighty.  Sanctification is a life long process that only God can work out through us.  God needs for us to be devoted and sold out to the process though.  God will never force us to short circuit those things that keep us from knowing Him fully.

       I finally have the time to do a blog about our trip to Texas and I can also insert some cool pictures and SHOW you who some of our friends are.        Katy and Paula Bush at Kitchen Table in Garland Texas. Paula and Katy were childhood friends.          Rachel Bush sitting at Computer        Katy meets Melody Morris for the first time in REAL LIFE!!          Katy and Karen Perring in kitchen at Robstown Texas just outside of Corpus Christi Texas. Karen was Katy's High School friend.          After the memorial service for Hal Eads on South Padre Island on Saturday we left on Sunday morning and spent the day in Richmond Texas with Carla Meuth.  Carla Meuth is a teacher at Sugurland Middle School who Katy worked with before we left Texas.           We left Richmond Texas on Monday after visiting with Carla Meuth and headed for Picyune Mississippi to visit with Dawn Vaughn who Katy knows through Circle of Friends elist. This picture shows Dawn and her 7 year old daughter Savannah          Our furry family members awaiting us when we arrived back in South Carolina

      Coming Home to Grace Fellowship Church   In July of 2000 we found ourselves living in Suburban Lodge off of Ashley Phosphate road in Charleston SC.  All five of us lived in a single room with two beds, a bathroom and a tiny kitchenette.  We found ourselves there because a decision had been made to utilize the medical services at MUSC for our daughter Jessica who was at that time 9 years old and had been diagnosed with a brain tumor.    In August of 2000 we met Troy and Shannon McNear in Goose Creek and we moved into their double wide trailer off of 159 Mapleridge Drive.  We spent several months getting settled into our new surroundings and learning what it was like to have a daughter with cancer.  Our church home was 2.5 hours away on Hilton Head Island and all the friends that we knew lived either in Texas or on Hilton Head Island or Bluffton SC.  We missed the comfort of having people that we knew close to us.  The search for a church home was sporadic at best and due to our circumstances we probably spent more time focusing on internal issues to our family vs. looking outside of our family.    In December of 2000 I wound up at the Trident Medical Center with chest pains in the Emergency Room.  For the last ten years I have suffered chest pains about once per year and every time I would be examined nothing could be found.  When I explained this to the doctors in the Trident Emergency Room they admitted me over night for observation and stress tests the next morning.  I remember the pastoral care lady that came by to visit with me just before I was to be released.  The first thing this pastoral care lady did was to ask me a direct question and wanted to know exactly how I felt about something.  I have no idea what the question was at this time but I remember unloading on her.  It is amazing that the lady stayed in the room with me longer than 5 minutes.  I guess I had a lot on my mind and she became the recipient of all those thoughts and feelings.  One of the focuses of the conversation was to find out where our family attended church.  Of course, at this point we were not attending anywhere.  We did not have a church home. The pastoral care representative assured me that she would provide me with a list of local churches and organizations before I was discharged from the hospital.  The conversation ended on that note and the lady took leave of my room.   I figured that would be the last I would see of anyone in Pastoral Care at Trident Hospital. I also figured that the lady went back to her office to put a big red X on my room on some centralized map of the rooms in the hospital to warn other Pastoral Care employees to steer clear.    Before I knew it Tom Glisson knocks on the door and introduces himself as the Director of Pastoral Counseling at Trident Hospital and wanted to come in to chat for a few moments.  I was having flash backs of the days when I would have fun with the local Jehovah's Witnesses.  At first I would play stupid and let them present their plan to me.  After a while I would start asking pointed questions about things to the point that they figured out that I was not a dummy and that I did in fact know something about my bible.  Before I would know it I would have older and wiser representatives showing up at my door.  So, here I was facing the "Big Gun" of pastoral care.  I did not know if I was in trouble or if he was there to just escort me off the property.     Tom Glisson is very good at what he does and I think that the first thing that he did was to put my mind to ease.  He was not there to shoot me with a big tranquilizer gun or to beat me up about what I had said or not said to his Pastoral Care representative.  Tom told me that he was a little uneasy with sharing that he was the pastor of Grace Fellowship Church.  He was uneasy about it because of ethical policies at the hospital which forbade him to solicit hospital patients for membership to the church he pastors. Tom Glisson offered me a list of local churches and told me if we happened to come by for a visit that we would be welcome.    I will never forget the day that I visited the CHEESY CHURCH located on a DEAD END Street in Goose Creek SC.  One rainy Saturday evening in December of 2000 I found Grace Fellowship Church.  If it had not been for the Internet and Mapquest I probably would have never found it.  I remember calling Katy while sitting in front of the church in the parking lot and commenting how CHEESY the church looked and that it was located in the middle of a subdivision on a dead end street.   At first glance this church did not even come close to meeting anything that was on my check list for a church to visit much less considering our home.  I was thinking, "You have got to be kidding me".  Who in the world comes here?  How can anyone find it?  What can I ever hope to find here?  What will my family think?  Does Pastor Tom Glisson REALLY pastor a church that looks like this?  Many thoughts went through my head and now I know that it was a good thing that I did not discount the value of the church because of the way the outside looked and where it was located.  I threw the mental check list into the trash and committed to visiting the next day which was Sunday.    Little did I know but Grace Fellowship Church would become our church home for 2.5 years.  I thought that I was the ONLY person that was crazy and had problems that most church pastors would shirk from.  I even found out that I could scratch behind my ear and say "my doctor said I would be fine, he just never said when" and they actually loved me despite my problems and invited us to keep coming back.  Maybe they kept allowing us to come back out of shear love and concern for Katy and the kids.    The year 2000 went into the year 2001 and in August of 2001 our daughter Jessica lost her battle with cancer and went to be with the Lord.   Grace Fellowship church may not be the "popular" church in Goose Creek or easy to find. Grace Fellowship has a group of people that could care less about what you wear or what you drive to church or where you live.  The church family accepts you for who you are and loves you despite your failures or shortcomings.  The road that we walked down between June of 2000 and August of 2001 was not a very pleasant one and it was full of trials and anguish.  I can honestly say that I am not sure that we would have survived the experience without the love and presence of Grace Fellowship Church and its members.  Grace Fellowship became our church home and Pastor Tom Glisson became our pastor during this time.    In October of 2001 my contract with ACS Government Services was coming to an end at the end of the year and I began to utilize the Internet and recruiters to find a new permanent IT job or contract.  Before I knew it I was offered a one year contract working for Ahold USA in Greenville SC.  We found a house in Simpsonville SC to rent and shortly thereafter we left to start a new life away from Goose Creek SC and Grace Fellowship church.  I can not tell you how tough that was to do.  To move away from people that love and care for you.  I remember Pastor Tom telling me about how upset he was about our leaving.  I also can not remember any other pastor ever telling me that.  The awesome part of being a member at Grace Fellowship Church is that you are not part of a huge organization that will swallow you up.  You are part of the family and people know when you are there or not there.   In November of 2002 Ahold USA laid off 36 employees and told the contractors that our contracts would be terminated in April of 2003.  On Feb 1 of 2003 my contract ended.  I have been looking for work since then. Between November of 2002 and January of 2003 our family attended a church on a regular basis.  We never joined because I did not know if this contract was going to be stable or not.  When the leadership of this church found out that I was laid off but that we had not joined their church body they told us that there was nothing they could do for us because we were not official church members.  We were not on their official church roll.  I suppose that our attending regularly and tithing had nothing to do with it.  It just was not good enough.  We had a similar experience with another church and I have to say that those experiences soured me towards church attendance in general.    Recently our church family at Grace Fellowship came through in a BIG way when they helped us to make a trip to Corpus Christi Texas so Katy could attend a memorial service for her brother who had passed away in August of this year.  Before we left for Texas we spent the weekend with Pastor Tom and his family and that was when he told me of a plan to approach the church to see about helping us to move back home.  I was certainly surprised and overwhelmed by the idea.  At this point in my life I was in survival mode making it from one day to the next and one week to the next wondering what in the world was going to happen to us.    I remember asking Pastor Tom why he was willing to approach the church about helping us in such a big way.  Pastor Tom just shrugged his shoulders and said, "You are part of our family aren't you?"  That is when I was reminded of the fact that even if you are not present in body once you become part of the church family at Grace Fellowship you are always considered family.  The whole time we were gone in Simpsonville we kept in contact with Pastor Tom, his family and other church members because we had developed meaningful relationships and we missed all of the fun that we had together.   Grace Fellowship has reminded us and shown us that we are loved and appreciated as the church provided the funds needed to move us and our belongings back to Goose Creek.  I am grateful for all of the hard work that was shown on Saturday when Pastor Tom, Tom Welch, Shawn, Troy McNear and many others whose names I can't remember helped us to unload the Uhaul truck and get settled back into our former residence. I am equally thankful to Troy and Shannon McNear for allowing us to move back into the house on 159 Mapleridge as well.    I am hopeful that Pastor Tom will share this story with the church either verbally or by passing this letter out so you can read it for yourself.  I want to thank each of you at Grace Fellowship who have played a part in our family and the family life at Grace Fellowship Church.  Your willingness to serve our family in both small and large ways has touched us tremendously.  We are back HOME and we are glad to be here.  Your love and generosity has stirred my faith in God and my spirit to the point that I want you to know that you too are part of our family.  If there is anything that we can ever do to serve you or Grace Fellowship all you have to do is contact us and we will do whatever we can to minister to your needs or situation.    Thank you again for being the family of God and for being there for us in our time of need.  May God richly bless you and anoint you to continue being who He wants you, the church, to be in this community.  In His Precious name and service The Moffitt Family

       This week is being spent getting things back into shape around the house.  We still have multiple boxes sitting around the house begging to be unloaded.  The job search is continuing and I have managed to clean up a majority of the jungle that was surrounding us on all sides.  It has been HOT HOT HOT here.  Whew, you would think I lived in Afghanistan.  Ok, maybe it has not been quite that hot but it has been pretty steamy here.   I went to hear Pastor Bob Gray at Trident Baptist Church on Monday and Tuesday.  The key message from Dr. Gray was on soul winning.  I have a five page sermon outline for those of you that are interested in digging into what the word of God has to say about that.    We are getting ready to go to Grace Fellowship for the monthly pot luck dinner which will be SO Yummy...

       We are on week two being back in Duck Ditch USA.  Quack Quack Quack.  You have to be part bird to live here since it rains here almost every afternoon and ..... You get the picture.    As I look around our metal shoebox I see two or three boxes left to unpack.  Katy went from 35 or 45 boxes down to THREE in the space of one week.  The trash man has been busy folks....  The next step is to put up some pictures and find appropriate places for our stuff.    Our friend and landlord (Paul Bunyon) is getting ready to move out the blue trailer next to us and make room for a brand new double wide trailer that he and his family can move into.  The "communal dictator" (aka: lady in a shoe across the street) is contemplating running out  of the shoe and over the hill because of all the stuff that she is going to have to move.  I can see it now.  If you were to fly high over our neighborhood when the move happens it will look like a line of ants moving stuff from one metal shoe box to another.  In the end our friends will have a bigger space to live in and eventually the moving madness will be over.  I have been forewarned by the communal dictator that I will need to find a new and improved alias for her since she will no longer qualify to be "the lady in the shoe" across the street.  Maybe you can help me with this?  I might as well put the comments section to good use here huh?  hahahahahahaha  Grace Fellowship Church is desperate for leadership so they named me as the  Mens Fellowship Director  and the  Audio Video Director .  I tried to wiggle out of the Mens Fellowship Director but for some reason that did not happen.  I figured that there were more capable men at GFC for leading others.  Now we have the blind leading the blind.  Poor men.... On second thought maybe this is a cool thing for me.  Part of fellowship includes eating food with other men once per month.  Since I  LOVE to eat  this part of the "directing" will be easy since I have NO problems finding  food .    This weekend Chucky Chandler who is the Youth Director for the Church of God of Prophecy will be preaching in our Sunday service.  That is going to be an awesome treat.  This guy is very animated and funny to listen to.  Not only that , he loves God and has a heart for ministry to the youth here in the state of SC.    I have ten weeks and counting before the unemployment insurance piggy bank runs dry.  I went on an interview today for a sales position at ADT in their small business sales department.  I am considering making a quantum leap from Information Technology to selling advanced security technology to small business.  I had an interesting conversation with the sales manager and it appears that I have a good chance at being offered the job.  The sales manager stated he is hiring two more folks and next week he will conduct the second interview and make job offers.  I am quickly running out of options.  From what I can tell ADT invests a lot of time and money into their sales team and I would be getting a lot of training right up front.  They want to equip me to be able to provide the best business security partner for area businesses.  In other words it would be way more than walking in, counting doors and windows and just selling contacts and wall monitor stations.  They train people to be able to use security technology to save money from all sorts of losses.    I got an application from Home Health Care out of Orangeburg  SC today after having mailed them my resume.  Orangeburg is approximately 45 minutes from Goose Creek SC.  I am thinking that they must be interested in me if they are responding to my resume by mailing me an application.    I spent all day yesterday over at my pastors house helping his wonderful wife getting their DSL Home Network set up. My oh my that was a treat in and of itself.  hahahahahah  Everything worked right up to the point that one particular computer decided that it would NOT play right with the rest of the children.  I told Katy earlier in the morning that it would be a 45 min job at the most and then it turns into a 7 hour ordeal.  The important thing is that all three computers are accessing the Bellsouth DSL network and everyone is happy.    I re invited   MY PRECIOUS  wife to be a contributor to our web log.  Katy is not as boisterous as I am when it comes to communicating but maybe we can get her to write down some of her thoughts.  I KNOW that I will probably get to see some of her "comments" to my drivel.   Katy...  The floor is yours dear..   Love ya!!  NO, I dont want to take out the trash or walk the dogs AGAIN......  hahahahahah  Dogs, puppies.  The later is the gift that simply keeps on giving.  Whew!!  I smell food from mamas kitchen so I must run away for a spell.  More drivel later.....

       urlLink blogging for beginners!   Patty told me just today that she has a friend who is mildly interested in reading my blog (must be bored) and possibly starting one of her own. My oh my, I have started something now.  :)  This link will give you an article "blogging for beginners" that has some very good information on it.  Please take the time to read through it and if you have any problems or questions send me an e-mail.  I personally use Blogger Pro on the hosting side with blogspot.com and I used w.bloggar which is a windows application that allows me to write down my drivel without having to be logged on to the www.blogger.com site.  w.bloggar has all of my account settings in a control file and it automagically logs me on and publishes my drivel when I am done.  w.bloggar also has a built in spell check and the ability to add graphics.   There are MANY different types of web log applications and services out there.  They range from FREE to very little cost.  As for me, I am happy with what I use and it gives me the opportunity to bang on the keyboard and share my thoughts with friends like you.  God bless

       Ok, I have done it now. :)  You can now "comment" on my "drivel". The old addage says you have not because you ask not. Patty asked and now her request was made reality.  Technology is pretty amazing. The only down side to technology is it is driven by our feeble human minds.  That means that sometimes technology is not meant for the task at hand or if it is it might not work when you expect it to.  :)  I look forward to your comments.  I have the ability to edit your comments and DELETE them if I deem it necessary.  In other words please be sure to leave the type of comments that will "encourage" and "motivate" others to love and good deeds.  I certainly do not expect everyone on the planet to subscribe to my thought processes or agree with any of the decisions that I have made down the road of life.  On the other hand please realize that when you are entering into my Web Log that you are an invited guest and all I ask is for you to mind your manners.  :)  Whew,  I hate saying stuff like that but you know how it is.  Before I know it I will have someone telling me what an idiot I am.  I know this because I have been the recipient of this type of "encouragement" both on Fidonet and Usenet Newsgroups in the past.  If you have read any of my blogs up to this point you know that I am up front and personal. My life is an open book.  I do not mince words and I do not sugar coat anything.  I try to be as REAL as I can possibly be.  When I do that sometimes I offend people and they take the opportunity to let me know every chance they get.    There is more to come folks since I have not written about the events of this weekend or the last couple of days.  Every day is a story.  You just have to be willing to put it to words.  I will return shortly after my run to town to take care of business this morning.  Have a SPLENDIFOROUS day!!!

      I received word from a friend this morning in e-mail stating that she would like to be able to leave comments about my drivel.  Wow.  Way cool Patty.  So, I will be attempting to install "Blogspeak" which is a free service that allows others to comment on my writing within our web log.  In order to "see" the changes I have to edit my template for our weblog and then republish the WebLog for the changes to appear.  That gives me ample opportunity to both drivel about new events as well as test.  Way cool aye?    James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net

       Labor Day 2003 is almost upon us.  Being that I am under employed and over appreciated I suppose I can still celebrate the right to work in the USA.  We take our freedoms for granted sometimes.  If you have been in America for most or all of your life then you think that it is quite normal that we are able to pursue any type of career that we have a skill to perform and expect more than minimum wage.  It is a fact that the unemployment rate is high here in SC and maybe in other states as well.  I bet that if you compared our unemployment rate in the U.S. with some third world countries that maybe it would pale in comparison.  I have been unemployed for 7 months now (gasp) but I have yet to have had to eat rice or beans out of a bag.  I guess that means that even in my unemployment status I am richer than some other folks that dont have access to our system.    What all of that means is that I am desperately trying to remind myself that while unemployment stinks and I am sick and tired of begging employers for a job things could be worse.  So, if you are unemployed and getting unemployment insurance be happy.  You could be unemployed and NOT getting unemployment insurance.  If you are unemployed and not getting unemployment insurance you too can be happy in that you live in America and can certainly find a "job" of any type if you are healthy enough to work.  Granted, that job might have to be flipping burgers at McDonalds and cleaning restrooms for minimum wage.  That is better than winding up on the street somewhere folks.   One of the things that can hinder our job searching tasks is our perception of what we are worth.  When I think of having to get out of bed to work at McDonalds I shudder.  That is because my perspective is that of a white collar worker that is "used" to making a LOT of money.  In 11 weeks from now guess what?  I will be at ZERO dollars an hour vs 7.50 that I make with unemployment benefits now and flipping burgers at McDonalds might be very tempting at that point.  Something vs nothing.  It is not hard to do the math on that one folks.   If you have a job and you are reading this realize that the grass is NOT greener on the other side of the unemployment line.  The grass is there but I can not afford to fertilize it, cut it, bag it up or whatever.  I can barely afford to walk on it much less do anything else.  I am so broke I can not pay attention.  Of course the reason for that is because I was not able to put LIFE on complete stand still while I search frantically for a JOB so I can pay those pesky bills that come in every month like clock work.  Employment may end but I can assure you that debt does not.    If you have a job but dont like it then consider the alternatives. Be thankful for that job every day because that job is what pays the bills and helps you to enjoy those little extras that you like and have grown accustomed to.

       urlLink Blog Speak author requesting donations   If you click on the above link you will see the e-mail that the author of blogspeak sent out to his subscribers.  Here we have a software programmer who is apparently quite talented that does several things.  He creates this service called  Blog Speak  so that folks like you can  add comments  to online  web logs .  He also provides the service free of charge to all of us.  He states on his website that the service is free but donations are welcome.  This software author actually pays an ISP to co host this service on one of their servers for a specific fee which he pays out of his pocket.  Now that Blog Speak is becoming more popular and the activity has picked up the ISP has taken notice and either wants this guy to upgrade his subscription for the service or they are going to shut him off.    I had $1.19 in my PayPal account this evening.  I have been out of work for 7 months and even though I dont have much I feel that if those people who benefit from this program will donate only 1.00 that he will be able to raise enough money to upgrade his service.  The PayPal e-mail address to send donations to is blogspeak@bighar.com.  If you can spare some extra change for this service I am sure that he would appreciate it.

        urlLink If you are a computer junkie like me here are some of my favorites   I spent some time cleaning up my "Computer Junkie" links on our family website today. I had a couple of bad links so I deleted those and added several new links of interest. I will list them below.    urlLink Gibson Research Corporation   If you connect to the Internet with a MS Windows Computer YOU MUST spend some quality time reading the content here and TESTING your computer for security risks.  If you do these things FAITHFULLY you will become a responsible Cyber Citizen that we will all love and appreciate.  If that does not appeal to you then rest assured that your data will be safe and hackers are us will not be able to control your computer from a remote location.  If that does not interest you please turn off your computer, put it back in the box and send it back to where you got it.    Please allow me to digress for a moment.  My desire is that you USE your computer for your specific needs whether it be work or play.  At the same time I want you to be aware that when you  connect  your computer to the  Internet  via your ISP of choice that you are no longer isolated and alone.  You have entered into a  community  of other users  world wide .  That means that you could be in danger of both  virus infection ,  hackers taking over your computer  or someone intentionally  deleting your data  off your hard drive.  Someone could take over your computer and USE it to launch DOS  (Denial of Service)  attacks on your friends, family or the business network down the street.     It is VERY important that you learn the basics with regards to safe computing both locally in your home environment but also with regards to interacting with others when you are connected on the Internet.  Here are some simple guide lines you can follow to make CERTAIN that you and I both are safe.     A. always have  Anti Virus  software running in the background  B. ALWAYS be  suspicious  of ANY and ALL  attachments .   C. run  Windows UPDATE  on your MS Windows Computer atleast once per week D. ALWAYS run  Live Update  on your  Anti Virus Software  IF it is not set to run automatically for you.  E. Always be  AWARE  of ANY  Critical Security Update  alerts from Microsoft.   INSTALL  these critical updates without fail.  If you are not sure about it ASK someone (like me) IF it is necessary.  I can garuntee you if it is listed as Critical or a Security Patch I will probably say YES.  F. Go to http://www.grc.com and TEST your computer for security leaks atleast once per month G.  Back up sensitive data  to a different  hard drive  or removable media on a  REGULAR  basis.  Hard Drives are man made and they WILL fail eventually. What will happen to your data if your hard drive crashes?   IT is GONE!!!!   Period, end of story.  All of those hours that you spent collecting and manipulating data is lost forever.  If you have a  CD Writer  on your computer use it to burn (write) your data to a blank CD. Do that once per month if not more often.      urlLink Blogger.com Website  Blogger is one of the most used and popular websites for Web Journaling.  There are MANY Web Journaling (blogging) services  out there that will allow you to do the same thing.  Some are FREE and some are NOT.     urlLink W. Bloggar    BloggAr  software is a MS Windows application that allows you to input all of your Bloggar Server settings into this app and allows you to write, edit and publish your blogs whether you are online or not.  To save some confusion this is how it works.   A. You use a BLOGGING (web journal) Service to publish your content (www.blogger.com) B. You HOST your Blog (web journal) on a Blogger Type Web Server (yourname.blogspot.com) C. You use Blogging Software (like w.bloggar) as an application to WRITE your web journal.    If that is not simple enough let me know and I will take a deep breath and try again.    urlLink Blog Express  First there was the WWW (world wide web).  Then came plain text (ascii) e-mail and then e-mail clients (Outlook and Outlook Express) gave us the ability to send HTML e-mail.  Hackers R Us (aka criminal idiots) figured out how to cause millions of dollars of damage by writing viruses (trojans, worms etc) that destroys data or causes Denial of Service attacks on personal computers and company networks.  RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a technology that has morphed from the need for a way to PUBLISH content but not have to worry about our Hackers R US folks.  Blog Express is what Outlook Express is for e-mail and Usenet Newsgroups.  If you are familiar with OE then you will LOVE Blog Express.

         I am a member of a Yahoo Community called LOOK.  I believe that it stands for LOSS of our kids.  There are mostly women on this Yahoo community who share about their grief.  If you have never lost a child to cancer or some childhood disease that takes them from you in this world then you will never be able to relate to the pain and anguish that this causes in the lives of those parents that are left behind.  I read a message on our Yahoo Community this morning when I woke up and this was my response as I attempted to relate to this mothers grief.  ___________________________________________________  Tears are a language that only God understands.  Everyone handles grief in their own unique and individual way.  Yes, I would say that you are making progress.  I know that I have made some progress over the last two years with regards to how I react when I think about Jessica. Maybe it is different for men than it is for women.  I believe that a Fathers love is a bit different than a mothers love.  Perhaps it is much harder for a mother to deal with grief especially considering the close bond that a mother has with a child that a father may never fully understand.  It is difficult for me to be able to relate to a mothers grief since I am not a mom.  I do know that as I have watched Katy deal with the grief that she has made some progress.  It seems as if the stressors that cause Katy to cry with regards to Jessica are much stronger and I think that is directly related to the fact that Katy was Jessica's immediate care giver and she spent much more time interacting with Jessica both when she was a healthy child as well as during her illness.  The more you bond with a person the closer and more intimate you become and therefore the grief you experience is probably more intense.  I guess that one of the ways that I try to handle my grief and the emotional responses to it is to try and not focus on those things that would make me cry.  At church we have a young lady that is in a wheel chair.  If I sit there and focus on it I can easily see Jessica sitting there and before long I would be deep in the pits of grief and despair.  So, instead of going down that road I choose to recognize the pain that is there and I try not to focus on it for too long.  I guess that helps me to manage my emotions.  My pastors wife went out to eat lunch with us the other day when we were at her house setting up a DSL network and she was sharing about this young lady that is a special needs child.  I thought she was going to make me cry so I had to change the subject.    I believe that as time goes on that the grief will not be as intense. It does not mean that we love our children less. I think about Jessica every day of my life.  She will always be daddy's little girl.  I tell Jesus to hug my girl every day when I pray.  I thank God for her life and for all the good memories of her life.  It is good that we have this place in our lives where we can think out loud and share our thoughts with others that are walking down the road of grief with us.  Today the citizens of the USA are remembering the horrible events of Sept 11, 2001.  Katy and I remember 9/11/01 for a different reason.  Jessica would have been 11 years old that day.  Today Jessica would have been 13 years old.  The reality is Jessica is no longer here with us but rather she has gone on to a much better place.  I am looking forward to the day when Jesus takes me from this life and I can be with Jessica and others that have passed on before me.  I have so many unanswered questions that only my God will be able to answer.  Perhaps I wont have to ask the questions when I get there because we may get all the answers when we transition from this world to the next.  Nevertheless Happy Birthday Jessica Ann Moffitt.  You are loved and appreciated today and forever more.  Say hello to all of the other children that must be there with you in the arms of Jesus.   In loving memory, forever you dad.....

           It is so wet that even the ducks have gone to higher ground.  If I had not been unemployed for the last 7 months I would go buy some gold fish to stock the ponds of water all around us.  We moved back to Boggy Creek (aka Duck Ditch) on August 23rd and I think it has rained every single day since then.  So, Duck Ditch will be Boggy Creek until the water is absorbed some more and the ducks wander back down to our little commune.  If you live in Duck Ditch there has to be ducks right?  I cant count the ducks that live at my neighbors house.  Those ducks are here whether they like it or not. If they could fly I am sure they WOULD fly away to higher and more dryer land.    I am on vacation until this next Monday.  Actually, my 7 month vacation ends then.  You either have more time than you have money or you have more money than you have time.  I would opt to have the later now that I have experienced 7 months of the former.  On Monday I will be employed by ADT in their business sales team.  Instead of asking you if you want fries with that hamburger I will ask you if you want motion sensors or more door sensors with that basic security package.  I dont think that I will be able to ask folks if they want to "biggie size" it or not.  :)  The only time I say that I want to biggie size anything is when I go out and try to find pants for myself.  Sigh.....  Lets not go there please....  In an effort to reduce the tent size of my waist line I have promised myself that I WILL go out and walk Monday through Friday for exercise. Today is Monday and guess what.  I have already blown it.  I walked Monday and then went bowling on our winter league for the first night and then my body started to punish me.  I never knew that my brain could receive that many signals from the different body parts all at once.  Katy told me that I was brain dead to be out walking just for the sake of getting exercise.  Maybe she has something there.  :) Luckily for me and my desire to loose some weight my new job will be just the ticket.  Between 10 am and 4pm Monday through Friday I will be out and about prowling around looking for potential customers which means walking from one business to another trying to make NEW friends.  Friends with money to spend and security needs to fulfill.  I can make money (hopefully) and loose weight at the same time.  What else can I ask for?  I spoke to Katy this morning and it is amazing what has happened in less than 3 weeks.  Here is a short list of what God has allowed to happen.  I say that because I did not have anything to do with it.   A. Moved us from Travelers Rest to Goose Creek  B. Allowed us to go back to our home church C. Allowed us to be around people who love us and care D. We are back in the house we originally moved out of when we left E. Our friends and landlord is helping us with regards to rent and utilities.  (HUGE PTL there) F. Katy has  a dishwasher again (Katy LOVES that) G. Katy has a washer and dryer that was donated by Cindy (Thanks Cindy) H. The church loaned us the 25" color TV that we donated to the church until I can buy another one.  I.  I have a new job starting Monday J. The children are enrolled in Public school  k. I have new opportunities for service at Grace Fellowship Church L. Grace Fellowship Church membership has almost doubled since we left.  That means growth, challenges and opportunity  Well anyway, I might have forgotten some of the details but you can see that we have a LOT to be thankful for.  We do not believe in circumstance but we do believe that God has his hand in every aspect of our lives.  If God is for us WHO can be against us?  NO ONE.  What can separate us from the Love of God?  NOTHING......    Yes, I am doing the happy dance.  Thanks for letting me share some POSITIVE & HAPPY stuff with you.  Thanks for the prayers and the support.  God is GOOD all the time!

       Why do I EVER waste my time in watching the Dallas Cowgirls ATTEMPT to play football????  Oh my gosh.  The first half seemed as if the cheer leaders were sitting on the bench and they actually had some guys that wanted to play the game with some level of skill.  At the half it was Dallas CG 7 and Atlanta Falcons 3.  I dont know what happened at the half time but I think that the cheerleaders mugged the team and tied them up in the locker room and came out the play the rest of the game.  Ok, I apologize, I should never insult the Dallas Cowgirl cheer leading squad for playing that PATHETIC of a second half.    What happened to the quarter back anyway?  He looked as if he had a problem running more than two steps at a time before he collapsed on his own. Once upon the time the Dallas Cowgirls used to be called the Cardiac Cowboys.  Those days are long over because now they can be called the Prozac Queens.  How sad a commentary on what USED to be my favorite NFL team.   On a positive note the Carolina Panthers came back to win by one point against the Jacksonville Jaguars.  Wahoooooo.  Perhaps I should support the team of the state I live in.  Go Panthers!!  Hey, now that I think of it my high school mascot was panthers.  Yeah!!!!  Church was good this morning as the State Youth Director , Chucky Chandler gave a good message.  He spoke on Judges Chapter 7 verse 15- ????  It had to do with God calling out Gideon to go do a task.  Anyway, you probably know the story of Gideon.  Everything went off without a hitch up until the point that the electronic gremlin attacked the tape player.  The special music was supposed to happen and the tape player decides to play the music at half volume and would not let me adjust it any higher.  The song played at half volume and the singer did her best to compensate for that and did a wonderful job.   Katy has been manipulating our home page so I need to take a peek at it to see what changes have happened.  Hope you guys and gals have a WONDERFUL week!  Nite Nite

       One week ago I interviewed with ADT for a sales position.  Thus far the drug screen came back fine and the preliminary background check came back clear.  Now we are waiting for the MAIN background check to come back clear.  So, the waiting game is in full swing.  Katy received a phone call from MUSC today because they are looking for two full time employees to work there doing what she used to do there before we left.  I have not seen Katy get that excited in a long time.  We REALLY need the income BADLY.  So, we shall see what happens after the interview on Friday.  That would be a full time job with benefits.  Wow, it is almost too hard to believe that she might get re hired there.  I am hopeful that the fact she used to work there and left on good terms might help out on this occasion.    Paul Bunyan and clan are feverishly trying to clear out their lot in lieu of their new home arriving.  They are working on a very tight time line but I am sure that he will manage to get it done in time. It looks weird on our front porch with the blue trailer missing.  Did I tell you that the blue trailer was moved out last week?  Well, if I did not tell you then you now understand what I am talking about.  Out with the old blue trailer and in with a new double wide trailer for my friends across the street to move into.  I am sure that they can not wait to be in their new home.   I started bowling on the Turbo League at the Marrington Lanes on the Naval Weapons Station two weeks ago. I still need to figure out which ball I am going to use because the way I am bowling I think that I need to find a cinder block to throw. I would probably be just as accurate throwing that down the lane at this point. It is just a matter of time and I will get used to the synthetic lanes.  Do you like to bowl?  If so, are you bowling on a league?  Which one and where?  Do they keep your scores online through League Secretary?  If so let me know where to look.  I hope that they don't keep our scores online with the way I am doing at the moment.  My games last night were 107, 125 and 117...  Something like that.  Nothing to brag about for sure. I think I need to take up knitting or something less demanding on eye hand coordination.  I am on week two of a small group that just started up called The Exemplary Husband.   The course has to do with "husbands" learning how to be "more" Christ like with regards to their marriage covenant with their wives.  I am only into week two and I told Katy that if this course tells me I have to give up burping (in the privacy of my own home) or hand over the television remote that I was in deep trouble.  Gosh, I guess I should have added giving up computer time and SHARE it with my family as well.  GASP.....    I told the group leader via e-mail that I could tell that I will need a large ace bandage by the time this course is over.  Knowing scripture and assuming that everything is ok at home can be a recipe for disaster when it comes to marriage.  Of course I am talking in the context of both husband and wife being believers in Christ.  Katy and I have been married now for almost 14 years.  I would like to say that our relationship is very special and that we are very compatible together.  They say that the longer you stay with one person you start to look just like them.  I hope and pray that does not happen to Katy.  Katy deserves better than that.  hahahahahahah  The small group will happen here locally and there is a book and study guide to go along with it.  This material is not for the faint hearted.  It will require prayer, study, more prayer, more study and a commitment on my part to make some changes.  Changes that will hopefully benefit my dear wife.  I can see some of you guys that might be reading this.  You are probably rolling your eyes at the idea of me walking away from the traditional macho image of " my marriage is none of your business and even if it were it is doing just GREAT."  Guess what guys.  Your marriage is not perfect because you are not perfect.  Every one of us guys have room to improve.  If you don't think so, get off your duff and go ask your wife IF there are any areas in your marriage that could use some improvement.  If you don't have the guts to go ask your wife for this input try this on for size.  Sit down in your recliner and rewind your brain to all of the times that your wife has asked you to do something and for whatever reasons you refused to do it.  "Good grief, that woman will just not stop whining about this and that."  I can hear you guys.  Do you think that maybe there is a REASON why your wife is NOT happy about your ENTIRE relationship and the way you treat her or act around the children??  Is your blood pressure elevated now?       I am not talking about the kind of marriage that the world paints for us on television sit coms where the man sits on the couch drinking beer while life happens all around him and make it look cool.  I am talking about the type of marriage covenant that the bible speaks about and what the husbands role really is.  Oooopsss, I just lost 90% of you.  Who wants to hear about that IMPOSSIBLE standard anyway?  It is much easier to be a lazy slob and only do what is necessary to keep the honey off your back side.    The bible says that we are to love our wives like Christ loves the church.  We are to do much more than expect or demand that our wives be submissive to us.  Who wants to be submissive to a lazy slob who drinks and eats non stop and wont give up the remote control or the computer?  LOL.....  Katy is probably rolling on the floor at this point to keep from crying.  I know the Lady in the Shoe is probably looking for oxygen at this point. No, I don't view myself as a lazy slob that eats non stop and refuses to hand over control to the TV and the computer.  I do know however that I do have a problem with being the type of husband that the bible says I am supposed to be.  The standard has been set and we (I) have a goal.  My goal is to be better, stronger, faster, we can rebuild him....  Sorry, that was the introduction to the Bionic Man.  As I was saying, my goal is to become a better, more Christ like husband for my wife.  The process will probably involve me doing some kicking and screaming along the way but when the process is over I will at least have a much better understanding of WHO I am supposed to be as a husband and WHAT I need to do to improve my relationship with Katy.      One of the points that this book makes is that in order for us to be the Exemplary Husband that we are supposed to be we first must be disciples of Christ. Here is how it works.    A. you read the bible, listen to a pastor or evangelist preach the word of God B. the Holy Spirit of God convicts you of your sin  C. the Holy Spirit presents you with the truth of the gospel which states that while you were yet sinners Christ died for you.  The gift of Grace is FREE and you can not earn it.  D. the Holy Spirit calls upon your heart and mind for a decision to turn away from your sin and give your heart to Christ and accept the free gift of GRACE.   E. you make the decision to repent (turn away) from your sinful nature and release the controls of your life to Christ and make Him your Lord and Savior OR F. you choose to rebel against God and the Holy Spirit when he calls you and you stay out of fellowship with God  If you are not a true believer of Jesus Christ in both word and deed then the book will leave you on the first two pages.  You are either of this world or you are not.  You either serve God or you serve the Devil.  Everything in this book builds on a relationship with Jesus Christ.  If you want to know more about what the Bible says about who Jesus Christ is and how you can receive forgiveness of your sins then feel free to write to me at moffittj@bellsouth.net and I can walk you through it.  I would be honored to tell you about what Jesus has done for me in my life.  As a matter of fact, while I am talking about this you can go to the following link and read my testimony of Who Jesus is to me online.   urlLink Who Jesus is to me   The gospel of Christ is not a popular message.  Christ crucified for the sins of the world past present and future.  God become man to reach out to the sick and lost.  God pursuing his creation to provide healing, health and eternal life.  My message to you in the context of this message may not be popular and you might even be a little angry.  I would rather take the chance of offending you now and providing you with the information you need about eternity than to attend your funeral knowing that I might never see you again.  We think that life is something we can take for granted when in fact the bible tells us that life is but a vapor.  One day we are here living life and the next moment it is gone.  So, if you are reading this and you think that you are guaranteed tomorrow morning think again.  None of us know when or how but we do know that our day will come.  My hope, desire and prayer is that you make the right decision and that you do not wait until it is too late.

           In Exodus Chapter 4 verse 2 it says " Then the Lord said to him, what is that in your hand?"  In this chapter we see that God is calling Moses to fulfill His purpose with regards to bringing the children of Israel out of captivity.  Moses knew that he was supposed to approach the Pharaoh and represent God and demand that he let His people go.  You know the story, we have all read it in Sunday School.    Our pastor is out of town at a Chaplains convention in Chicago IL.  Our visiting speaker used the scripture reading out of Exodus Chapter 4 verses 1 through 5 for his sermon topic.  The following points were made and I feel that they speak powerfully to our lives if we will only let them.   Sermon points by Doug Dickerson at Grace Fellowship Church September 21, 2003    Moses doubted his ability to do what God asked of him.  He doubted because of "doubt and fear" and "low self esteem".      God will help you work out your fear but will NOT work with your fear.    God desires for us to rise above our circumstances and inadequacies so that He can use us to fulfill His purposes.    God is not interested in "what ifs" but rather what is in your hands.    God empowers us through our obedience       Who God IS, is more important than what our circumstances or problems    What is in your hand?    What can God use in your life to touch others?    The very thing that keeps us from using what is in our hand is in our hearts. Doubt, fear, low self esteem, low self confidence etc.....    What is in your hand is the very evidence of God    What is in your hand is an extension of God    God works through His people to accomplish His purposes    In obedience we bring our gifts to God, no matter how big or small, then God takes those gifts and he multiplies them so that he can use us to accomplish his purposes    We can be blessed with the gift God brings us or we can choose to bless others with that gift    What I do not have is not what matters, it is what I do have and what I do with it    What is in your hand is an expression of God. Love, mercy, compassion, forgiveness etc...    God takes our gift , multiplies it, then uses our hands to distribute the blessings to others that need them    If we dont use the talents God gave us we will loose them    God gives us gifts and talents so that they can be used not so that we can horde them and keep them to ourselves and become stagnant.    We need to invest in the lives of other people with these gifts    Examine what is in your hand and ask yourself how long you will keep hanging on to it    We should pray that God will show us how to let our hands be an extension of who He is to the community of people we are in.   Here are a few thoughts of my own as I reflect on what I got out of todays message and challenge.    Heb 4:12  For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.     When we read the word of God we need to count the cost and realize that God's word is not designed to make us feel comfortable but rather to reveal Gods glory, majesty, holiness, righteousness and purpose for our lives.      Jam 1:22  Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.  Jam 1:23  Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror  Jam 1:24  and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.  Jam 1:25  But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does.     The Holy Spirit takes the scriptures and brings relevance to our lives by speaking to our spirit about where we are at and where we have come from.  We are admonished to do what is right with regards to our relationship with God and we are encouraged to be all that we can be for the kingdom.  We have a choice to either get with the program and become the men and women of God or we can choose to ignore what the Holy Spirit is teaching us about our character and purpose.    I am thankful that in the past I have been blessed to both receive a gift or talent and to use that gift or talent to bless others.  Like Moses I too have had to wrestle with fear, doubt and low self esteem.  My confidence level was not where I wanted it to be when God has chosen to use me in whatever endeavour that He chose for me at those times in my life.  I can remember several occasions where the task at hand was very daunting and I doubted my ability to make the grade.  Do you really want to use me Lord?  Then after the doubt comes all of the "but what ifs?"  What if they perceive me as inadequate Lord? What if they think thus and so?  What about my looks Lord, I am too fat, thin, tall, short etc.??  How many times do we compare ourselves to our neighbors and feel so inadequate next to them?    So, the question that I leave you with is the same one that I was asked today.   What IS in your hand?   What has God given you?  What talent or gift has God given you and are you still holding on to the gift and have not let it go ?  Is your talent or gift blessing the life of someone else today?  Yes, it is good that I have been blessed in the past and that God has used me back then.  Those days are in the history book so I must not revel in what happened in the past and look to the future to see HOW God is going to use me today.  How will we invest in the lives of our fellow man and bless them?  We have the power of life and death in our tongue.  How will we motivate others into love and good deeds?     Heb 10:23  Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.  Heb 10:24  And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.

       You probably noticed that I did NOT say anything about my bowling scores last night.  Oh my gosh.  I think that Justin , my 8 year old son  would have done much better.  It is a good thing I bowl for fun and not for the money because I would be a starving bowler about right now.    I was released out of my cage for the day to ride along with my mentor/trainer.  I can not tell if this person is corrupting me or actually trying to train me.  LOL...  No , actually this person is good at what they do and they are doing their best to teach me something.  Hopefully my business cards will come to me either tomorrow or Wed and they will set me free to try and go sell some security products and services in the greater Charleston area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The weather here in Duck Ditch is absolutely wonderful.  It got up to 73 degrees today with clear skies.  What a huge blessing that has been.  The dog days of summer are over and FALL is in the air.

       You have got to love training.  Here  I sit at the office wondering what to do next.  I think that perhaps my mind works just a tad faster than they are used to here.  I want to run out of the building, get into my car and drive down to Office Depot and get my own business cards and start making calls on small businesses.  I understand that I am not completely ready to answer every single question that someone might want to ask but then again I wont be ready to do that for quite a few months from now.  So, here I sit, waiting on the slow, tedious process of training to take place while I make a whopping 6.25 per hour.  I know that I have to be patient and play the game.  So, here I am sitting here in my monkey suit wondering if my boss will show back up at the office this afternoon to review  my work.  I finished that an hour ago.  Yeah me!!  Go team.  Show me the money.  LOL...  It is sort of weird being on the end user side of technology vs being the one responsible for making it work.  I am listening to all of the old hands here whine about ADT going to using Outlook Web Access vs the users utilizing Outlook Express to get their email.  I am sitting here just listening to them thinking about how wonderful it is that I dont have to try to console them or explain to them WHY the company chose to go this route or whatever.  I can act like the dumb and ignorant and no one is the wiser.   Yahooooo!  The lady in the shoe is getting her new shoe today.  They are going to come back on Wed with the giant shoe laces to put her larger, more roomier shoe together.  I asked my neighbor if she was packed yet and she laughed at that.  I asked her if she was going to use the AIR FLOW method of moving where you get a LARGE fan and start throwing stuff in front of it and point it in the general direction of where you want it to land.  Something was said about the dump and burn method of moving. I hope she does not do that with all of the critters that she has fenced in behind her current home.  Poor ducks and chickens will NOT be happy about that.   When I get home later this evening I will let you know how good I did at bowling or how poorly I did.  If I do not say anything and ignore the subject alltogether you know that I really had a bad night.  However, if I break 100 every game and atleast get a 130 or above I will be pretty happy since I have a whopping 114 average right now.  How sad is that boys and girls?  I had a 157 average over at Golden Lanes in Greenville SC last year.  Then again I bowled on 4 different leagues.  They say practice makes perfect and whoever they are they are correct.   Okie dokie, the boss called me on the cell while I was beating this out on my keyboard telling me that he wont see me until the AM.  That means that this mousie is outta here.   Have a great evening folks.

      The highlight of this week for Katy and I was on Saturday evening when we were able to make a Fly Baby and Blogger enthusiast connection.  Patty met up with us over in Mt. Pleasant SC which is about 35 min from Duck Ditch USA.        Patty and Katy together       James , Patty & Katy   The Fly Baby group (Katy and Patty) and I had a good time eating at Outback Steak House and talking about our interests.  This was the first time for Patty to have met someone that she knew online.  This will be our fifth or sixth time over the last 10 years. Patty told me via IM yesterday and today that after meeting us that she has been encouraged to do some of those Fly Lady "tasks"  that really needed to get done.  Its nice to know that I have had some kind of positive influence but I dont think I can take credit for it.        Patty showed us her bright yellow VW Bug and when you look inside you find the following fuzzy creatures.  They are SO CUTE!!        The LARGE yellow Sun Flower was special to Katy and I because our Jessica was fond of them.           This is a recent picture of Kristina (on left) and Tanda on the right.  These two are very cloes and go to the same school together.     Well, I would like to say more BUT it seems as if all the online IM critters are surfacing and since I have not been online much they are hopping all over for my attention. So, with that in mind I will leave you with this pictorial update and wish you a blessed, safe and productive week.    God bless

       Today was a day for celebration as I was able to complete my very first sale for ADT.  Splash N Dash Car Wash on 109 Redbank Rd in Goose Creek.  Wahoooo!!     I told you about Paul Bunyon and his family getting a new home but I failed to show you some pictures.  Now that our Jesus Connect Domain server is feeling better I uploaded a couple of "select" shots for your viewing pleasure.             Did I tell you that I have a NEW found respect for sales people?  LOL....  Now that I ARE ONE I can tell you that the chosen profession is certainly NOT a cake walk.  I do have a new found respect for folks that have chosen to do sales for a living.  As I have been told in the last 3 weeks, there are those folks that stumble through the day to day activities of being a sales person with no real game plan and then there are those professionals who have studied the ART of selling and have learned to put together a game plan that they can follow which in turn should bring them a measure of success.    I spent 1.5 weeks in the office learning what I needed to learn to get started in my training process.  I spent last Thursday and Friday cold calling and wound up with 45 contacts to follow up on.  I was rewarded with 4 proposals to submit and one of them has already turned into a sale.  I may have another one tomorrow and I have a promise for a Burglar Alarm sale next week.  The hardest part of the whole process is learning the paperwork and the work flow process.  Getting into the office , doing what has to be done and getting the heck out of Dodge to do the FUN stuff which is finding those ever elusive customers.    Did I mention my Trainer/Mentor/friend who's name we will leave anonymous to protect him from any laughter that might spawn from my comments ABOUT him.  Lets see, we have Paul Bunyon, the lady in the shoe and now we need to come up with an alias for my mentor/trainer/friend.  For now lets just call my mentor and trainer "AWANA MAN".  Some of you might be wondering what Awana stands for and WHY I am calling him this.  Here is a link to educate you on WHAT the Awana program is for.     urlLink This link will tell you ABOUT the AWANA program   I know Awana Man because of my friendship to Paul Bunyon across the street.  Paul Bunyon and his children and my children all attend the same Awana program and Paul Bunyon and Awana man attend the same church where this program is being held.  Therefore I know and work with this mentor/trainer/friend.  Lest I forget, let me also tell you that both of these men are Awana LEADERS in their church.    The first thing that I noticed about Awana Man is that he is about 6' 6" tall. That means that I have to look up at his slightly balding head and receding hair line.  I also noticed that when I am around Awana man that I do not feel as if I am the largest man on the planet with regards to my girth.  Awana man and I share this endearing quality.  I had to laugh when I first saw Awana Man's work badge which was hung from his rear view mirror in the FORD truck that he loves dearly.  Gosh, I proclaimed to my friend, you look like a CONVICT in that picture.  It is no wonder he does not ever put the ID on when he is going to visit a new customer.    The most important thing about my relationship to Awana man other than our girth is that he shares my ability to be shy, mild mannered and meek.  I really have to prod and poke and shove on Awana man to get him to share what is on his mind.  It is a wonder he is successful at being in sales.  (Pausing for the laughter....)  It is a GOOD thing that my new found friend/mentor/trainer at work does not go online and read my BLOG....  Excuse me for a second.  I can see the Lady in the shoe pointing her mouse at the PRINT icon on her desktop.  HEY stop that.....  Dont ruin my fun, ok??  hahahahahaha  I hear my slightly worn but ever so comfortable recliner calling my name.  I will have to shooo that animal farm away or out of the chair , heck, I might have to coax Gizmo out of it as well.  Hummmmm the couch does look appealing too.  Maybe I could curl up there for a long winters nap.....  Sweet dreams one and all!  You can stick a fork in me, I am done!

      What that means to you is while the domain is down all of my blog pictures are missing. Our ministry server located at Jesus Connect.net had a crash this weekend and my friend in Houston Texas is in the process of reloading everything.  I hope that he had a good backup and that in a matter of days everything will be back online as it was.

        I went over to a friends house over off of Amy road and Hollywood.  No, not Hollywood California but rather Hollywood Street in Duck Ditch USA.  I can assure you I live no where near Hollywood.  I ate part of the new philly cheesesteak pizza that they are advertising.  I ate it and then about 45 min later it drug me to the bathroom at my friends house.  Need I say more about THAT picture?  All I can say is that I almost needed to have oxygen pumped in to that part of the house.    So, I guess you could say that I got my moneys worth out of the FREE dominos pizza that I consumed.  The meal that just kept on giving and giving and giving.  What does that have to do with McDonalds?  Go to McDonalds and order anything.  Be sure to order a small drink.  After your meal you will probably be thirsty and will find yourself wandering back to the counter in the hopes of finding an intelligent person to greet you.  I dare you to ask them for a cup for a drink of water.  Heck, skip asking for the cup, just ask for some water.  They will tell you that they do not serve FREE water but rather have decided to sell you a 32 ounce bottle of water.  Spring water that is, not just any sulfer water that you might find gurggling from one of the many wells here in Duck Ditch.    I will never forget how rediculous this was.  I was so stunned by the idiocy of the whole concept that I found msyelf stumbling away from the counter mumbling under my breath.   Me, at loss for words, how can THAT be?  Trust me, it happened.   Last night Katy and I watched the movie HOT CHICK....  The movie was probably not appropriate for an 8 year old son nor my 12 year old daughter.  Kristina, the 12 year old daughter was not really bothered by anything in the movie.  In retrospect I guess that means that she knows more about the birds and the bees that either of her parents realize at this point.  How scary is that boys and girls?? I almost forgot.  Our 8 year old son, Justin, just giggled through 90% of the movie and kept his head hidden in his favorite "blankie".  I guess that means that he is not damaged just yet.  PTL for that.   This evening while consuming the man eating pizza I watched 2Fast and 2Furious as well as Dream Catcher.  Mark it on the calendar folks.  I watched two movies that I have NEVER seen before.  What is even scarier is that my friend allowed is baby boy to watch Dream Catcher.  How is the baby you ask?  Can you say 2 or 3 ??  There were scenes in this movie that would give most grown adults nightmares for a week.  There was this child sitting in daddies lap firmly grasping his "nook nook" between his lips and taking it all in.  I looked at Dad and asked him about the wisdom of letting his boy watch such things at a tender age and he told me " oh we let our children watch anything and everything....".    For those of you waiting for an update on my latest career endeavour here goes.  I spent last Thursday and Friday wearing my tie and ADT "official" name tag and visited 45 different businesses.  I did 35 on Thursday and 10 on Friday.  Out of all those contacts I wound up with 3 proposals.  One add on proposal for a camera system (add on not new sale) a BA proposal (Burglar Alarm) and another camera system ADD ON for Dollar General in Duck Ditch USA.  I also ran across two residential sales leads that I passed on to my manager.  Just yesterday I was at Splash N Dash INC which is a brand spanking new car wash in (you guessed it)  Quack Quack USA and wound up giving a tri fold hand out to the business owner who was on site. It turns out that the owner is interested in one color camera to watch her spiffy new Laser "touchless" car wash bay via our camera and a high speed Internet connection.  So, she wants a proposal for that tomorrow. She told me that if she gets the system and likes it she will duplicate that in her Summerville store.    I guess that you could say that my first two days on the job pounding the pavement was a smashing sucess.  Half the battle is over, I have their interest, now to do the proposals and complete the actual sale which in turn will net me a nice little bonus prize at the end of the week.    The Exemplary Husband small group is moving right along.  Last week I spent 4 hours studying chapter 4 and when I was done I thought to myself.  Gosh, I am glad that I disciplined myself to get that out of the way all in one sitting.  Then I picked up the check list to find out that Chapter 5 and 6 were the two chapters required for Thursdays group meeting.  Those chapters cost me another 2.5 hours over the next two days.  So, all in all I spent about 8 hours in three chapters and wrote about 5 pages worth of notes.  We are going to cover chapter 7 this week and we have until chapter 15 of the book which is at the end.  That means another 8 fun filled weeks of learning how to be a BETTER more Christ like husband.  My hope is that I will be a better husband.  On occasion I have engaged Katy in the process by reading to her definitions and principles to verify those areas that I am a big dope in as well as those areas where I do ok.  Katy is reduced to fits of laughter at some of the things that I read her which ultimately means that I have hit a hot spot with those topics.  GULP.....    Lest I forget, the lady in the shoe across the street has a new BOOT to move into next to us.  I say "boot" because this place is 2 times bigger than what she is in now.  I actually got a semi guided tour of the new home yesterday and this place is very NICE.  I know that the family across the street (Paul Bunyon and his wife and 7 children) will absolutely LOVE the new digs.....    Well, I guess that is all for now.  That should update ya until next time.  Have a great week and enjoy Life to its fullest.    God bless

      You have heard me talk about RSS and RSS readers in the past.  So, with that in mind here is a review that I read today on one of the RSS feeds from Lockergnome Technology RSS feed.  So, please understand that this is NOT my review but that of Marc Erickson.    "There are many different RSS readers out there, and the choices are growing every day. For this roundup we picked some of the top new choices and even found one for the Pocket PC. FeedDemon - Full featured RSS reader with lots of bells and whistles. The Cadillac of RSS readers right now. Aggreg8 - Mozilla add-on that provides a simple interface and basic RSS functionality. NewsGator - Unique RSS reader that functions as an add-on to Microsoft Outlook. Blends in nicely with the Outlook interface. Feedreader - Basic RSS reader that gets the job done without a lot of bells and whistles. PocketFeed - Basic reader for Pocket PCs. Still at an early stage of development but we found it usable and quite cool. SharpReader - SharpReader requires Microsoft's .NET framework. It provides basic reader functionality and features. Nothing to rave about but quite functional." (Marc Erickson)

        Today is a new day and the anger of yesterday has abated somewhat.  Because of that and other thought processes I will continue with my endeavours at ADT on Monday.  I figure that I am working for myself.  So, what I have started in the last several weeks is something that I can build on.  I know that the business is out there and that all I need to do is find it and cultivate it.  I have come to some conclusions that I am not necessarily happy about but then again we all face things in our lives both professionally and personally that we have no control over.  If I have no control over something then it would be silly for me to allow that thing to anger me to the point of controlling me.  People are going to be who they are and there is nothing that I can do to change them. All I can do is accept others despite their short comings and try to forgive them and get on with life.     Through the pain onward to battle and victory is a statement that I heard many years ago. I believe that the pastor of Abundant Life Church in Houston Texas used that as a sermon title one Sunday.  That title is a powerful statement that I can identify with.  As humans we all experience pain and discomfort whether it be physical, emotional, spiritual or mental.  Sometimes we experience it in all of the areas or just a combination of one or two.  Pain stinks.  There is no other way to put it.  No matter what we try to do to mask it or hide it the pain is there , it hurts and there is nothing we can do to run from it.  How long do we hide from pain or mask it?  Sure, there are times when we can deaden the pain by retreating to using alcohol , drugs or other things in life.  The problem with doing this is the pain never goes away until we deal with it directly.  Through the pain onward to battle and victory.  Some of us deal with pain by lashing out at others and trying to transfer the pain onto them and make them responsible.  Somehow we find solace in inflicting pain on others thinking that since we hurt others should hurt too.  Sometimes we deal with pain by allowing it to drive us into deep despair and depression.  Perhaps there at times that this is a normal response and then sometimes we may not be willing to get beyond that despair and depression because we find comfort there.    Katy and I are both working through the pain of loosing our daughter to cancer two years ago.  I said that pain stinks.  The pain caused by grief is in the same category.  People love to tell you that time heals all wounds.  I am not sure where those people got that statement because I am not sure that is a realistic assesment of recovery.  Maybe it would be better stated to say that over time the pain is not as intense.  Over time you learn how to live with the pain.  I dont think that the pain will ever be totally healed and forgotten.  For those of you that have never lost a child to cancer you can not even come close to understanding the depth of despair and anguish that a parent goes through.  The best thing that you can do for those of us that have lived through this type of pain is not to talk to us but rather just listen.  That may be harsh to swallow but somehow words and intentions sometimes do more damage than they do good.    How much pain can one withstand you ask?  I asked that question after I moved my family to Simpsonville SC and then one month later the one year contract was prematurely ended.  We were 3 hours away from Charleston and knew absolutely no one.  No church home to attend, very little reserve capital to fall back on and 278.00 per week from unemployment benefits.  Some of you might be saying  OH just suck it up and deal with it and quit being a whiney baby about it.  I understand that in the grand scheme of things that there are OTHER folks out there that are suffering MORE than we have.  Somehow when you are dealing with the pain of YOUR issues it is hard to find solace in the fact that there are others suffering more than you.  You have two choices to make ultimately.  Face the pain and deal with it or allow it do drive you under and defeat you.    That takes us to the battle.  Sometimes the battle affects others that are around you.  As we are fighting our personal pain sometimes others become victims of our warfare.  No, it is not fair but it happens.  Gosh, could that be WHY I have very few friends?  LOL....  Maybe I am so deep into the warfare of fighting the pain that I just dont have time to invest in being a friend to others.  Could that be?  Part of the battle comes in the shape of keeping the marriage and family in one piece.  Luckily for me I have the most awesome wife in the world.  Katy has always been there for me through thick and thin.  The other aspect of battling with the pain is that it sometimes crosses over into our professional lives.     I will probably continue this thought process but not now.  I sat down at the computer wondering what I was going to say and how and you see what happened. I have more to say than time allows at the moment.  I need to go get Kristina and Justin from the Awana car wash in Goose Creek.  I hope you have a good day and a restful weekend.   God bless

       I spent all week in St. Louis Missouri learning how to be a BETTER sales person. I learned the 7 step sales process.  I actually learned a lot from this course.  I have stayed at better hotels and eaten better food but all in all the experience was positive.   Today I got my first commission check.  When I looked at it I thought that there was something wrong with the amount.  So, I pulled out my commission sheet to find out that in fact I should have gotten much more than the amount on my check.  After investigating further and talking to my manager I was told that instead of my getting training pay that what I was really getting was a draw on my potential sales.  That is NOT what I was told verbally by my manager.  I was told that I would receive training pay and that as soon as I started to make sales that the training pay would stop and I would receive the commissions I earned.  So, I am in a lose lose scenario with the manager.  I guess that when I signed the paperwork at the beginning I should have double checked all the fine print with regards to the so called "garuntee" that he spoke about today.  That also means that the next two months if I do not make enough sales that they will deduct my "garuntee" from those commission checks as well.    As you can imagine I was NOT a happy camper.  My motiation to go out and sell went to ZERO.....  As it stands right now I am looking for somewhere else to donate my time and talents.  On a positive note it appears that Katy might be doing some substitute teaching in about a week for both Berkeley County and Charleston County.    Gosh, all of that training , for what??

       Good morning folks!  Rise and shine and give God the glory!  Today is God's gift to us, what we do with it will depend on what gift we give back to Him.    My trip to St. Louis yesterday was rather uneventful.  The weather was wonderful and very little turbulence.  I especially enjoyed the slim design of the coach seats on both aircraft.  I believe that when Boeing designed the seats they were assuming that only tiny people fly.  Why is that anyway?    When I got to St. Louis I spent approximately 30 minutes running around like a chicken with his head cut off trying to find the "supposed limo" that would meet me there to pick me up and take me to Holiday Inn.  The first thing that should have clued me in was the name HOLIDAY INN.   After much investigation I finally figured out which (cough) Limo was supposed to pick me up.  The Limo turned out to be a Chevy Van.  The important thing is that I met up with my party and rode for about 40 minutes to the other side of St. Louis to the Holiday Inn that I am now trapped in.    For some weird reason I did not get ALL the information with regards to the itinerary here because when I got on the van some of the other sales folks told me that I would have a room mate.  I said "No way!"  and they said "Yeah WAY!".  When I arrived at the hotel, sure enough I received a package at the front door with my room mate's name on it.  My "roomie"  did not arrive until around midnight when I was just getting ready to dose off.  How special was that?  I grunted something at him and went back to sleep.  When I woke up this morning he had his head buried under his pillow which means that I must have removed the pain on the wall by his bed with my snoring.  Poor poor roomie huh?  Maybe I will get lucky and he will go get his own private room so he wont have to deal with my snoring.    Here in ST Louis it is 6:15 am, but to my biological clock it is 7:15 am.  So, I am up and reading e-mail and scribbling in my blog.  Wahoooooo.  I love my Internet connection while away from home.  It sort of makes me feel like I have not left yet.  I can see it now.  I am gone and my side of the bed at home has been taken over by the two mutts, Sammy and Angel.  Well, atleast the dogs dont snore so maybe Gizmo will get caught up on her sleep huh?  When I left yesterday the kids were happily doing their thing and did not seem to mind the fact that daddy was leaving for a week.  Gizmo was also smiling when I told her good bye at the airport as well.   I guess that 8 months of bonding will do that to ya...    Well, I have been up for over an hour already and have not had my first cup of coffee.  So, I suppose that I will leave my cyber seat for now and go find java.  Have a wonderful day!!  God bless

       I received some cool pictures of Jeremy dressed up in his band uniform performing with the rest of his squad.  Here is one of them.       I was told that at the end of the session that Jeremy collapsed and had to be taken to the hospital via ambulance.  Apparently he is fine and was just dehydrated.  I am certainly glad that he is ok.  I can remember how hot it gets in Houston Texas so I can only imagine how hard it would be to carry that Tuba around in the heat with those hot uniforms that they have to wear.    Good Job Jeremy !!

       urlLink Solar Storm Warning   Have you ever had anything unusual happen to you ?  Have you ever done anything out of character and found the need to say "the devil made me do it?"  If that happened to you yesterday you have a valid excuse.  You can now say, " I am sorry, that is really out of character for me but I probably did thus and so because of how I was affected by the solor storm that hit us".  I am positive that your response to any inquiries about unusual behaviour patterns or bad decisions will be met with much empathy once you give this reason.    If you are in sales or are tethered down by any electronic leashes such as pagers or cell phones then you can always tell your boss that " the incoming solar storm probably kept the signal from reaching me".  LOL....    I read through most of the article that this blogette is referring to and it was interesting reading.  I was reminded of how LARGE and IMMENSE our universe really is.  I was also reminded of how awesome and humbling it is to realize that we are only but a small part of the cosmos that we inhabit.  I think that we get so tied up in the daily events of our lives that we fail to see anything higher than the roof of our cars or houses and we forget about those things that we are shielded from in outer space.  Some of our friends and family might accuse us of being "lost in space" when we walk around in a daze or do something silly.    This concludes this Solar Storm summary for today.  :)

       They say that time flies when you are having fun.  This week ZOOMED past me and I am still trying to figure out IF I really had fun.  I had fun last Monday night when I bowled a 141, 156 and 167.  That is way over my average for this league which is a 120.  I am finally getting used to the synthetic lanes I guess.    On Tuesday of this week I went out to Cottagville and made a sale , BA and Cell backup which equals to two units.  I have 8 more units to meet quota for the month and I have 3 more weeks to make that.  I spent most of my day at the Convention Center in Charleston and working with a Dental Office on a proposal.  At 8 am I was to meet the Dentist at his new location and wound up speaking to him on the phone.  Get me a proposal, I am already an ADT customer and this needs to be done yesterday so I can get the sheet rock people to finish their part in this construction.  So, with that information in hand I spend some time doing just that.  At the end of the day the customer says, wow, I need to think about this and get back with you.  I think that the monthly charge was giving him heart burn.  I have an 11 am appointment this morning through Telmar which means that someone saw an ADT commercial or heard ABOUT ADT and called in to our call center requesting to speak to a sales rep.    I had to put my Thursday night small group attendance on hold.  I am not too happy about that since I had made a committment to do it.  I wrote an e-mail to the small group leader and I know he was/is disappointed that I can not make it.  Sometimes priorities really stink.  I am 9 months past due on all of my financial responsibilities which means that my number one priority for now is to get my business off the ground and profitable.  That means some 12 and 16 hour days for a while until I get established.  That means working 6 days per week.    I hope you have a great weekend folks!

       urlLink The Ryze Network    I got sucked into the Ryze Network today.  I started out this weekend by searching for sales leads and business networking groups on Google.  If you dont know what Google is then you need to know that it is one of the best search engines on the Internet.  No, it is not the ONLY search engine but I choose to use it because of how simple it is to use and I seem to get the most hits off of it.   The link above will take YOU to MY Ryze home page.  I am using this home page to advertise my Information Technology and Business Risk Assesment and Asset Protection services that I offer.  They offer a GOLD subscription which is 9.95 per month but I think that I will check this out a bit longer before I make the plunge.  I am very interested in all of the different NETWORKS that have been started already and I subscribed to quite a few of them today.   My primary purpose for joining Ryze is to network with other sales and I.T. Professionals here in the lowcountry of SC.  My secondary purpose for joining is the network with other christians and folks who have the same interests as me.  So, with that in mind, you probably received an e-mail from me today asking you to join.  The cost to you is FREE and all it will take is a few moments of your time to fill out the form.  I think it took me all of 5 minutes to join this morning before I headed off to church.   Justin and Kristina went to Awana's tonight and apparently they had a contest to see who had the goofiest hat.  Gizmo got creative in the last minute and I will be sure to upload the pictures so you can see them soon.    God bless

        Miracles NEVER cease to happen folks!  The Dallas Cowgirls have morphed back into the Dallas Cowboys in my mind.  I have been watching this team play (or attempt to play) NFL football since the late 1960's.  Yes, I was born in 1961 so that means I have been watching them for most of my life.  I am not much of a sports enthusiast but thanks to my dads interest in the team he got me hooked at a tender age.    It appears that Bill Purcell is whipping this franchise into a formidable opponent to reckon with.  We shall see how they do when they face Tampa Bay next week down in Tampa Bay Florida.    Go DALLAS !!  5 wins and 1 loss which means that they are NUMBER ONE in the NFC East for the first time in how many years?     urlLink

       This is a new day and I have a new focus and direction.  The commission only sales position at ADT lasted 7 weeks.  I believe that this would have been a possibility after building the business for 6 months to a year.  The only problem with my remaining active in this role is that my finances just wont allow me to do it.  I need income now and not six months from now.  Economics forced my hand and now I am back to the drawing board looking for a job with a paycheck attached to it.    Wish me luck!

       What are you doing right now?  I am in front of the television watching the South Carolina Panther and Texas Texans NFL football game.  Thus far this looks like a pretty close game. The score now is 7 to zero with Carolina leading the game.  I am not what you would call a football fanatic but I do like to follow the Dallas Cowboys when they manage to to win a few games.  This year Dallas is 5 wins with 2 losses so that means that they are doing much better than their performance over the last four or five years.  Today Dallas and the Redskins will go head to head.  Dallas usually wins the match when they are playing at home so we shall see if they can come off their loss to the Bucaneers last week and play some football.  The weather outside is 80 degrees with no clouds in the sky.  Katy announced it is Happy Nappy time (2pm) after feeding her brood a yummy lunch.  The weather is nice, the doors and windows are open and the children are outside enjoying the wonderful weather.    Did I tell you that we live close to the Charleston International airport?  The airport shares runways with the Air Force Base and the LARGE transport planes (C17's?)that fly out of there sometimes fly so low they rattle my eye teeth.  I have heard of eye teeth before but is there such a thing?    Ok, it is half time and I think that it IS Happy Nappy time.  I need to recharge my batteries in time for the Cowboys Redskins game.

       urlLink Displaced Make Do in Calif. Shelters (washingtonpost.com)   Just when I thought that I endured a week this side of hell I read an article like this one.  Thanks to information over load most people find themselves deluged with more news stories than we have time to read them.  More often than not a lot of folks are probably paying attention to what is going on in Iraq instead of paying attention to what is going on right here in our own Nation.    When I read this article it reminded me of how blessed I truly am.  By some standards where I live and what we live in probably does not measure up to what some may be comfortable with.  Nevertheless my family and I have a safe place to live which provides us with the necessities of life and then some.  I was reminded of this again as I read of the displacement and loss of thousands of Califronia residents who have lost everything due to the raging fires.  I would encourage you to take the time to read this article and then to pray for those folks.  Most of us reading this probably do not have the time or means to make a trip to California to help those that are less fortunate than ourselves.  However we can pray and we can make small donations to the American Red Cross via their website so that we can do "our" part to help.  When everyone does a small part all of a sudden there is a LOT of help being given to those that need it.    Life is God's gift to us, what we do with it is our gift back to God and those around us.  Pay it forward!  God bless

       urlLink Robert Half International   On Tuesday I registered with the "Office Team" division of Robert Half International.  I left the house at 8 am and arrived downtown Charleston at approximately 10:15pm.  My appointment was for 9 am.  I tried going down N. Rhett to 526 but ran into a parking lot.  At 8:45 am I finally turned around and took the Rivers Avenue route to I-26 towards Charleston and ran into another parking lot.  Gosh, it was almost as if I should have just stayed in bed.  I perservered and made it to Meeting Street downtown.  I took several exams.  Data Processing, Word, Excel and last but not least typing.  I did 85k keystrokes for Data Entry, scored basic skills for Word and Excel and 70 wpm with 97% accuracy for typing.  That all means that I qualify for a clerical position through Office Team.  Oh yeah, I am so excited about that.  LOL....  I received a call from RHI on Thursday stating that a company is looking for part time help two days a week to handle a company's Ebay business.  I can do that in my sleep so it looks like I atleat have a part time position on Monday's and Tuesday's.  The position is supposed to go permanent within 2 months so we shall see.   Robert Half Technology which is RHI's Technology division is located in Greenville SC in the Upstate.  Jennifer called me from the Greenville branch and told me that the client that has the asset inventory position wants to see what my qualifications are before they make a decision to let me take the 1 or 2 week contract.  I told Jennifer that I was probably WAY OVER qualified for an inventory job.    This is an employers market.  Too many people out of work and not enough jobs to go around.  That means employers can pick and choose the cream of the crop and they dont have to pay people what they are worth not to mention UNDER what the market could bear.

       Have you recovered from gorging yourself full of Turkey and all the trimmings yet?  Maybe you are still slumbering and have not awakened yet after collapsing into your recliner or favorite couch yesterday afternoon.  Our family went to the Meritage Restaurant in downtown Charleston SC yesterday and were blessed by the owner and his staff who volunteered their time, talents, food and facility so that our group from Happy Days and Special Times could enjoy a fabulous Thanksgiving dinner and fellowship.  There were approximately 45 people who attended and the family that traveled the farthest was from Pensacola Florida.    We came home after filling ourselves with some wonderful food and settled down in front of the television to watch the Miami Dolphins feed the Dallas Cowgirls to the sharks. Can you say OH MY GOSH.  What about those Cowgirls?  The Dallas defense who is ranked number one (not any more) in the NFC East acted as if they could not stop the run or the pass.  The score (cough) was 40 to 21 in the Dolphins favor.  Now the Cowboys are 8 wins and 4 losses which I believe takes them out of first place in the NFC East (2nd place perhaps) and Miami is now 8 wins and 3 losses which puts them in a good standing for a wildcard position in the AFC.    This weekend will find us at the Happy Days and Special Times reunion that is held the weekend after Thanksgiving every year in Charleston.  This year, since we moved back we wont need to stay in the hotel so we can show up for the festivities and then come home and sleep in our own beds which will be nice.   If you were like most Americans you were out shopping at Wallyworld or one of the malls in your location at the wonderful hour of 5 or 6 am as you went toe to toe with all of the other shoppers trying to cash in on the early bird deals.  As for me and my house we were fast asleep with the visions of James finding a job some day soon.  Our Christmas will be so wonderful if we can just manage to pay the bills and not have anything cut off or canceled due to non payment.  As a matter of fact I just got off the phone with a recruiter who is searching for a Network Administrator in the SC area.  They want a 4 year degree and certifications but perhaps if I pass their online screening and telephone interviews they might waive the educational prerequisite and trade out for years of experience and knowledge.  We shall see how I do on the online screen test first.   In lieu of fighting with holiday shoppers for this or that we stayed home and managed to get our Christmas tree up along with most of the other holiday trappings.  I have SEVERAL pictures to show you but for the complete list of pictures you can go to  urlLink Thanksgiving Pictures for your enjoyment  and there you will see the entire list of 30 + pictures that I took in the last day or two.  If you click on each picture from that web page you will view the picture in your web browser of choice.

        I fought the law and the law won....  No, that does not match.  I ran out to my car and lost my footing and tumbled down three brick stairs at church.  The bricks did not even give for a second.  I now can honestly say that I have invested, blood , sweat, tears and money into our local church.  I could have skipped the blood portion of this experience but atleast I can say I have a well rounded experience.  :)  The Dallas Cowboys are still number ONE in the NFC East division with a record of 8 wins and 3 losses.  They lost to the Patriots last week and won against the Carolina Panthers this week.  Wahooooo !  Go Cowboys!  My part time assignment through RHI in Charleston lasted all of 14 hours this last week.  They needed for me to set up a new computer system in their office and get the data transferred from the old computer to the new one.  Once all of that was done they had someone who could step in and do the photography and auctions online.    Katy is now registered to work as a substitute teacher in both Charleston and Berkeley Counties.  Katy has worked now for almost two weeks substituting for Charleston County.  Atleast that means one of us will start bringing in some sort of income in the very near future.  Katy also has an interview in the morning at a local school in Goose Creek for a teachers assistant position which would be full time employment with benefits.  That would be very nice if she gets it.  Out of desperation I went to a security company and filled out their paperwork to see if I can get a security commission in SC to do security work.  That is the LAST thing I want to do at the moment but since I can not seem to find any type of employment I suppose that I might be able to fall back on my 10 years of experience in Security. Now I get to wait on the criminal background check from SLED to see if they will authorize me.  I already got clearance to be registered as an alarm installer so I dont see why I cant get authorized to get my Security Officer commission as well.  We shall see.   That means working nights and weekends and probably holidays.  I figure I can work nights , come home and sleep six hours in the morning and then hopefully find some part time computer gigs to do in the afternoon hours while looking for employment.  Hopefully it wont last for too long since I have not worked night shift in almost 15 years.    The lady in the boot.  Do you remember her?  She is married to Mr. Bunyon.  The REAL man who lives next door with his family.  The family in the new boot.  :)  They had their house warming party this weekend and 60+ people showed up.  My son Justin was running around looking for a flashlight so he could help park cars.  It was funny to watch him all excited about doing that.  I think he thought he was going to get dad's nice flashlight to do this with.  NOT....  My son Jeremy just had his senior picture taken but thanks to our FTP site being down I can not show it to you here.  As soon as it is up again I will upload it and show it to you.  I am so proud of him and I can not believe he is almost 18 years old.  April of 2004 he will be a young adult ready to wander out into this world to make his mark.

OK then, I was certainly enlightened by this story.  Just when I thought that I was limited to using DIAL soap or DOVE I now learn it is ok to pamper myself with skin moisturizers and no one will think that I am weird or overtly feminine.  Honey, you are off the hook for Christmas.  I did want a Jaguar for Christmas but now I realize that I have been missing the boat.  I want to pamper myself now.

      Hello folks!  Christmas 2003 is upon us already.  Are you ready?  How wrapped up and consumed are we with regards to those events that take place during this time of the year?  Someone reminded me AGAIN of the need to remember the REASON we celebrate this Christmas season.  Its not Xmas as the world would have us to think but rather CHRISTmas.  Christ IS the central theme for this holiday whether we embrace it or not. A friend of mine posted a message on a board that I help to moderate and asked what our gift to God was going to be?  What birthday present will WE bring Jesus this year?  This was my answer.   _____________________________________________________________  I can not believe it is already Christmas.....Where in the world has time flown to?  They say (who is they anyway?) that when you get older time flies faster and faster.  Gosh, whoever they is, they are wise. Maybe THEY are older than I am?  I turned 42 years on Thanksgiving (gulp) and I can attest to the fact that the years are picking up speed.   I think that the best gift that I can give Jesus for his birthday is as much of ME as possible. :) I was talking to someone at the bowling alley on Monday night about my walking through the trials and tribulations that my family has experienced in the last couple of years.  Here are some of those thoughts as I related them.  We all go through some sort of trial or tribulation in our lives. No one is exempt from pain, suffering or trials. No one is sinless and everyone needs grace, forgiveness, mercy and healing in some area of their lives. Maybe some more than others nonetheless we are all in the same humanity row boat.  :)  One of the things that I have struggled with is the ongoing battle. I keep asking when is it going to end?  Perhaps the answer to that is that it will never end until Jesus takes me out of this world and graduates me to where my Jessica is.  Part of my battle has been to accept the battle which is full of struggles, pain and strife. My perception has had to change to accept my circumstances and realize that the battle does not belong to James. I have had to learn (still learning) how to accept the position of weakness and to throw off the never ending struggle for control over those things I have no control over.  In my weakness HE is strong.  Not in my ability to control my circumstances God provides.  :)  So, with that in mind, my gift to the Lord is to learn how to give up the controls in those areas that I feel I am weak in so that HE can do what HE is going to do anyway. I also need to ACCEPT my position within the battle. I so do NOT want to be in the midst of all of this. I so much would rather have a job, be able to pay all my bills on time and NOT depend on anyone for anything.  That is so far from reality at this point.  Reality states that I am here and I need to have a clearer understanding of the battle and atleast do my part to be thankful and appreciative that things are not any worse than they are. Sometimes being thankful in the midst of adversity is a gift all by itself. So, that is another gift that I will try to bring the Lord.  Being thankful in the midst of the adversity.    The other gift that I am going to try to bring to the Lord is the gift of service when I am able to serve. I have precious few dollars to donate but I do have lots of talent and time that I can bring to the table. So, with that in mind, instead of stressing out and being depressed about being stressed out and depressed I will try to channel that energy into areas of service in my local church.  I have always served in church and played a role of service to my fellow brothers and sisters. Sometimes that service has given my the ability to forget the battle that rages on within and gives me some much needed respite.    I also want to bring another gift to the Lord for his birthday.  That gift is to be a better  and less selfish husband to my wife. My wife is a gift to me and even though I try to show her love and appreciation through my lips and sometimes my actions I know that I need to show her more action and less lip service. I need to be more proactive in doing those things that will bring her joy and happiness in our relationship.  I need to serve my family more and myself less.    Help me Jesus to see where I have failed and give me the strength and perserverance and faith to embrace your power and love so that I can bring these gifts to your table.

       This morning I caught Katy eating Grape Nuts.....  I thought to myself, since when?  I told her that only OLDER people eat Grape Nuts and that most OLDER folks eat that for roughage..... I also told her that Grape Nuts was a good cereal to pick for OLDER people because you can eat it with or without your dentures.....    Katy and I had a real GOOD laugh over that one.  Poor Katy, what is she gonna do with me anyway?    I have the beginnings of a nasty cold.  For the last week I have been fighting first a chest cold and then a head cold. Last night I made things worse by working security out in the COLD for 5.5 hours directing traffic at Charleston Southern University.  I was so cold my bone marrow hurt.  It was only 41 degrees outside so it is not like it was freezing or anything.  After standing around for 5.5 hours you could not have told me it was not freezing because I was so cold I wanted to set myself on fire.  I went home at 10:44pm last night and my head cold was having a good time with me.  I was running like a faucet.  Thanks to a hot meal and a dose of Theraflu I was able to settle in for a long winters nap.  We did not crawl out of the house until around noon today.    It appears that Katy's 83 station wagon has taken ill as well.  It seems that the battery and/or alternator has expired.  Who knows, maybe both.  When it rains it pours. The jalopy will have to sit in COLD storage until we can gather the funds to fix it and use my car for transportation.  Katy works during the day and it looks like I will work at night time so we can make this happen.    It is 13 days to Christmas.  I know this because Justin Matthew Moffitt advised us of this today.  Do you remember being 8 years old and having Christmas two weeks away?  It seemed as if 14 days was an eternity.  Now, in my  older age, 13 days passes by and I don't even realize what happened. They say that the older you get the faster time flies.  Whoever said that knew what they were talking about.    Hey, guess what?  NO ONE is leaving comments on my blog any longer.  What gives folks?  Are you still reading this blather or have you just gone to peeking at the pictures only?  Tell me that you, my fan club, are visiting and reading my blog so that I will be encouraged to continue my daily drivel.    Happy Holidays

      Today was spent in class listening to a level I,II &III SLED instructor talk to us (7 men) about carrying a firearm in the state of South Carolina.  After the class room instruction that lasted about 2 hours we made a trip to the ATP indoor range in Goose Creek.  We were to qualify with a firearm and make a score of 170 out of 250 to qualify.  My score was 236 out of 250 which means that I qualify to carry a firearm as a Security Officer in South Carolina.  Now I wait for SLED to finish my criminal background check and commission me to carry the firearm as a South Carolina Security Officer.    Here is the kicker folks.  The ironic part of all of this.  At the beginning of the class the SLED instructor tells us that if we KNOW that we KNOW that we can not take another human life in the line of duty that no one would think anything bad if they needed to leave the room and not take the course.  He reminded us of the somber responsiblity of being in a position to make a split second decision as to whether someone would live or die in the line of duty.  Some of you might be thinking that only peace officers (police officers) have to make those decisions.  If you are thinking on this line of thought I can tell you from having been on both sides of the fence that Peace Officers probably have more opportunity to do this just because their jobs are to enforce the law.  Security Officers are private sector security personell who protect the lives of the customer , their customers and property.  That means that there is a possibility that the Security Officer may be presented with serious bodily injury or death because of the actions of some perpetrator and therefore the need to carry a firearm.   The ironic part of this is what you are paid for this type of responsibility every time you put on the uniform and place yourself in possible danger. Would you believe 8.50 per hour?  Here is something even scarier than that.  No one can pay you enough to take the risk of getting shot at.  How much is enough? Do Police Officers get paid enough to take a risk that they might be shot by someone in the line of duty?  What about our soldiers?  The answer is no, no one gets paid enough to get shot at.  The sad thing is that we live in such a fallen world and there are folks out there that take pleasure in preying on the general population at large.  Security and Police and our armed forces are a necessary evil that we have had to put in place to help protect those law abiding families out there that are about the business of living.    You might think that I am trying to play on your sympathies or make you admire the job that these different folks do.  What I am trying to do is to make you aware of the dangers that they face and that they do a job that other folks are not able to do.  Not everyone is cut out to take those types of risks or make those types of decisions.  Maybe you are a nurse and you do not feint at the sight of blood.  Maybe you are a steel worker who walks steel beams five stories off the ground with nothing but a leather belt to hold you in case you fall.  What about window washers that clean windows on skyscrapers?  We all do our jobs for one reason or the other.  One reason is because we have a driving need to pay bills and one reason is because we are uniquely gifted to do what we do.    Here are some pictures of my target today!       The white tape were four practice rounds

       urlLink Boston.com / News / Boston Globe / Editorial / Opinion / Op-ed / The soldiers Bush didn't visit on Thanksgiving   This is a reality check for those of us that are safe and secure and warm in our homes this morning here in America.  Thanks to the technology of today we are bombarded with images of war every day both on TV as well as magazines and Internet access to sites such as CNN.  It seems as if there is nothing that escapes our perview. The only way we can escape the harsh realities of life and the human sufferings of others is to deny ourselves any type of media consumption.  How often do we do that?    I believe that because we have such instant access to the violence all around us that we have become desensitized to the pain and anguish of others all around us.  That goes for the drive by shooting in North Charleston to the wounded soldier in Baghdad.  We hear reports of random violence every single day and we are far removed from becoming emotionally involved.  We tell ourselves that yes the world is a violent place to live in BUT it is happening to THOSE people and not me or my family.  Some of us kid ourselves into thinking that we dont have to worry about it happening to us. We rationalize that because we are who we are or because of where we live we surround ourselves with a false sense of security and hope in that those things will not happen to us.   I come from a family of men who have served their country.  They served their country and went wherever they were sent and did whatever they had to do to stay alive and come back home to their families.  It is so easy for us to sit back and be arm chair politicians and analyze the validity of where our men and women are sent.  Intellectually we say we count the cost and we realize that some of those men and women will give their lives so that we can have the privelege and right to be arm chair politicians and critics of our government and their policies.  This article is not designed to take a political view point or to decide for us IF we should be where our men and women are fighting in Iraq.  What this article does is it snaps us back into reality and helps us to count the cost of freedom.  Men and women are being killed, maimed and tortured in the name of freedom.  If it was your son or daughter that was over there dodging bullets or wondering if they were going to live another day because of worry about landmines, suicide bombers or car bombs then your perspective on the war would probably be much different.    Take time out this morning or whenever it is that you read this and say a heart felt prayer for both the men and women that are fighting for our right to be FREE in America and for those families that have loved ones that are SERVING us with their very life blood on foreign soil.  The LEAST that we can do is PRAY to God and ask HIM for HIS devine guidance and protection for our men and women.  The next thing we can do is to be sensitive to the needs of those family members that are here and are missing their spouses or sons and daughters wherever it is they have been deployed to.  If those people knew that we are proud of their family members for serving our country and were willing to atleast give them some of our precious time to just listen to them or help out in some small way I know that it would help them tremendously.    Lets pray that somehow this campaign of terror that America is involved in fighting will somehow be resolved so that our men and women can come home once and for all.  I know that might be an unrealistic hope or dream but atleast we can HOPE.

I forget the artist or the name of the song but it was pretty popular for a short period of time. You know the drill. You drive up and are greeted by someone on the other end of the speaker who has a difficult time speaking clearly.  If that is not bad enough the speaker is a radio shack reject that should have been tossed out in the garbage.  Somehow they always wind up staring you in the face just as you want to have an intelligent conversation with the order taker.  The song goes on about a typcial order and because the communications is so screwed up the driver looses composure and winds up driving the car through the plate glass window of the restaurant in frustration.   I wonder if this lady in Houston Texas had this song running around her tiny brain BEFORE she lost all self control and decided to run over the manager.  I can relate to being frustrated over my order being screwed up.  How long does it take to order a Big Mac with cheese, GREASY fries and a cold drink?  How long does it take the mental process of keying it into the computer so that someone else can read it?  Nano seconds folks.... Its not that hard or atleast you would not think so.  We like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt therefore that is why we do not just drive to the window and hand the person a dry marker board with the order WRITTEN out in LARGE block letters.  We figure they understand plain english and that they comprehend that we want CHEESE and MAYONAISE on our freaking burger.    I LOVE the fact that the lady tossed her meal back through the drive through window.  How much damage did that cause?  Heck, we can all laugh about that.  Who knows, on an extremely bad day we might even park our cars, walk into the restaurant in question, identify the manager , take aim and fire the food at the idiot who got it wrong.  If you do that remember to take the bun off the burger so that when contact is made it will not bounce but stick to the subjects face when it lands.  If you miss, just walk over to someone elses food and grab their burger and yell FOOD fight real loud........  OK, maybe I am taking this a little too far.  You see the humor or maybe you are a manager of a drive in burger joint and you probably have already closed your browser window.   Attempted murder with a motor vehicle certainly goes above and beyond the call of duty.  Its one thing to catch your husband cheating on you and then decide to kill him with your car.  Its another thing to try and kill the manager because they forgot the mayo.  I wonder if the lady had the song "Grandma got run over by a reindeer song" just before she threw it in reverse and mashed the gas.....

      I tried to post this using my w.bloggar program but it was spewing forth a weird error tonight for some reason.  This article, which is excellent was delivered to me through my RSS reader that I use to keep up with different types of news content on the Internet.  Have you started to explore RSS yet?  If not, ya need to soon.  :)  This is an excellent article and it hits close to home for me since I have spent the last 13+ years doing computer and network support.  I can not tell you how many times I have asked someone when the last time they did a backup or updated their antivirus software and got a blank stare.  What did you just say?  No, it is not that people are stupid but rather they are just uniformed and uneducated about some very critical information that they need to learn quickly.  People feel that if they shuck out X amount of bucks for the latest and greatest computer at Best Buy or wherever that when they take it home their journey should begin with little to no learning curve.  The truth of the matter is that the learning curve just began.  There is no end to the learning curve with regards to computer maintenance and learning how to use software and software subscriptions that come with that new computer.    Anyway, enjoy this excellent article.     GNOMEREPORT: No Cooties For Christmas    Am I nuts here? Do you think that anti-virus companies are doing as much as they should to protect you? What about the media? Many of you out there most likely think that they are. I, on the other hand, would tend to disagree. Sure, they do the best they can to protect our computers in a literal sense. But what about ensuring that newer computer users understand how to use the darn things?  For those of you that do not deal with "Mom and Pop" computer users everyday, there is a huge lack of understanding that is going on all over the U.S. and perhaps all over the world. I have worked with many college-educated professionals that honestly believe that you install the software to protect your computer and voila, you are protected. This would be a dream come true - unfortunately, this is just not reality. I'm so tired of trying to calm angry, confused, and frustrated clients who are positive that "I" must be trying to con them when I alert them to the fact that there is a multitude of viruses on their computer.  So who is to blame here? Is it my fault? Well, I can only show them how to protect themselves after I have actually had the opportunity to meet them for the first time. It is most certainly not the clients' fault. How can we expect them to take responsibility for something that most people have never even heard of, much less know how to deal with? There is a desperate need for some healing here, folks. I'll tell ya, I am plum ticked. Who at, you ask? First and foremost the mainstream media for their lack of decent coverage. For instance, my local paper (that shall remain nameless) really blew it as far as I am concerned when the Blaster worm hit. "Just go to the Windows Update Web site and install all of the available patches. Also be sure to update your anti-virus software as well," states my local newspaper. My phone rang off of the hook that day with people asking me what in the sam hill was the newspaper talking about? A huge number of readers had no clue what a "patch" was, much less where to get it from the updates Web site or how to use an anti-virus program.  So being that I am a loudmouth, I called the editor to "share my love" for the article. Guess what the man told me? He stated that the Blaster worm was not a problem any more and there was no reason to add anything to the article in future issues of the paper. I asked him about other viruses and was promptly told that according to his HIGH SCHOOL son, viruses were "not a big deal" and this will almost for sure never be an issue in the future. (Meaning Blaster type worms) Now, I am going to stop on that note because I am not going to go down that sadly misdirected path again. I simply refuse to.   All right, then, what are some positive ways that this could have been avoided?  The newspaper ought to have toyed with the concept of speaking to a professional about the virus problem and what could then be done to prevent future outbreaks.  The article could have given basic instructions on how to update McAfee and Norton anti-virus. It would have taken less than a small paragraph for both sets of instructions.  The newspaper could have advised people who are new to computers to seek help. There are a few outreach programs here in my local area that can help those in need, free of charge. (Myself included.) The newspaper could have offered phone numbers to these resources.  The anti-virus companies, too, must share responsibility for this problem. They need to put a bright stickers on the front of their product boxes making it clear that it is imperative to read any included instructions. This ensures that newer computer users jumping into the new software are educated in what they need to know.  Now it comes back to us. What can we do to deal with this ever-growing problem? Simple, we educate. Those of you that are self-employed IT folks should take one day every two weeks and help low-income families and seniors that cannot afford to pay our regular rates. What goes around comes around. Sure, you may not get paid, but you could be making a real difference to someone that really needs it.  Now everybody sing: "C'mon people now, smile on your brother. Everybody get together, try and virus scan one another right now..." Okay, that was pretty bad, I admit. Seriously though, if we all went out on occasion and did this, many of these people might show their friends and family members how to protect themselves, as well. Then, maybe, just maybe... viruses would not spread as quickly and viciously as they do now. Think about it! /end rant   Let's get digital, Matt Hartley     James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net

       urlLink Berkeley County South Carolina Web Page   I worked 2pm until 10 pm today at Bayer Industrial park.  Yes, the same company that makes Bayer Aspirin.  At this plant they do not manufacture that product though.  I got home at 10 pm and headed down Redbank Road, turned right on Old Back River rd.  I stopped at the 3 way stop that the county just installed and then turned left on Mapleridge Dr.  I almost ALWAYS use my turn signals.  I was slowing down at the end of Mapleridge Drive to let the neighborhood scrooge pull his new white Ford Mustang into his driveway when I see blue and white overheads coming on behind me. Say do what I thought?  At first I thought that they must be responding to a call down by one of the trailers where we live.  Nevertheless I stopped the car and the first officer in the first of three units came up to my car with his flashlight on me.  The deputy told me that I did not use my turn signal when entering Mapleridge drive and that is why they (all three units) stopped me.  When the deputy saw my security uniform he told me that they were doing drug enforcement in our neighborhood and that he was going to let me go.  I told him thank you and went on my merry way and heard one of the other units on my hand held scanner talk to the officer that stopped me.  The deputy stated that I was wearing an American Security Jacket and that is why he probably did not jack me up.    Now that I am thinking about it they must have been sitting off of a side street in my neighborhood because they were not sitting anywhere on Old Backriver between Redbank and where I turned.  That means there was no way that they could have seen whether I used my turn signal or not.  I think that they were looking to jack up a druggie on our street which unfortunately is KNOWN to have some shady characters.  Oh well, they threw me back into the pond and maybe they will get lucky on the next one they reel in.

       urlLink jesus-connect.net :: Index   Have you ever heard of Jesus Connect Ministries?  If not, now you have.  :)  Jesus Connect Ministries is a para church ministry that has a clear set vision and ministry focus.  Our vision and ministry focus includes supporting the local church.  In other words, we know and encourage believers in Christ to faithfully worship and serve in their local church.    With that said, visit with us and read our vision and mission statement.  We have been online for 10 years now and in the last two years we have had to change servers and start from scratch.  That means we lost over 500 members.  Some of those members were active and some were not.  So, we have a nice clean start and we can start adding folks as of now.  If you register for an account I will validate you.   I am hoping to see some activity on this BBS soon.

      Check out  urlLink Forty Days of Purpose   Katy and I are going to be doing this as a GREAT way to start out 2004.  One chapter per day for fourty days.  Check out the URL above and see if this is something you would like to do to enhance your heart attitude for 2004. It does not matter where you are at in your spiritual journey. All that matters is that you realize that you have not arrived and that you too can learn something.  Sometimes it is not a matter of learning something new but rather it is the ability to apply what you have learned in such  a way that it makes your life better.  Sometimes small changes can make a world of difference.  When we change our heart attitude and our mental attitudes about the things in our lives not only will we be better for it but our lives will be more peaceful and full of joy.  When that happens those around us see a difference and they like being around us more.  When we can see change in us then we can eventually affect change in the people around us in our community.  All it takes is the willingness to understand that we have not arrived at all knowledge and that God can show us something new about himself and about our world that HE created for us.  Maybe the commitment will take some sacrifice.  I am figuring it will take a minimum of 15 minutes per day and maybe even 30.  It is highly recommended by Rick Warren that you take the time to read the devotional, scriptures listed and then meditate , pray and then journal what is being shown to you in your spirit.   I will be posting here in my blog some of those insights as I feel led to post them.  No matter whether you decide to do the Fourty Days of Purpose devotional or not, I encourage you to do something.  Do something that will increase your pursuit of God in your life.  You will be a winner if you do.  God bless      James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net

       The year 2003 is almost GONE.  POOF!  Where in the world did it go?  All I know is that I will be GLAD to see it be GONE.  The year 2003 was not one of my favorites along with 2000,01 and 02.  Maybe 2004 WILL be much better for me and my family.    I must say that things are starting to look better for us with regards to finances.  Katy is doing substitute teaching and I am doing private security.  We are not bringing in as much income as we are used to BUT we are bringing in SOMETHING which compared to NOTHING is a very good start on the new year.    The other day Katy managed to injure herself on a bed frame.  You might be asking yourself "how in the world can you injure yourself on a bed frame?"  You can do that by take the frame off the bed and sitting it in the hallway outside of Justn's room with the sharp ends pointing towards the door and then running into it with your bare foot at full speed.  Can you say OUCH ???  Poor dear is hobbling along but healing nicely.     Remember the  Lady in the Shoe    who moved out of the shoe into a brand new triple wide trailer next to us?  I am happy to annouce that the  Lady in the Shoe    is now being promoted to  Nurse Shannon .  :)   Nurse Shannon  has been faithfully tending to the minor medical emergencies in her own personal slum community here at the bottom of the hill.  We lovingly call Nurse Shannon and her Paul Bunyon (the  REAL man  of the neighborhood) as Slum Lords.  :)  On November 27 of 2003 I started up a Yahoo Group called  Happy Days and Special Times  for all of the family members who are associated with this awesome group here in Charleston SC.  In just 30 days we have 16 members and over 200 messages.  I am looking forward to seeing more and more folks signing up and becoming a part of our cyber extension of this wonderful community of families who support one another.  You can view the website for Happy Days at  urlLink Founder Debbie Stephenson    Battle Plan ministries Bill Berry  (founder and newly ordained minister of Central Church) has decided to encourage the men to enter into 2004 by starting it out with the  40 Days of Purpose  by Rick Warren who is the pastor of Saddleback Church in California.   You can find the specifics of this devotional series by visiting their website at the following link.   urlLink Rick Warren Founder of Saddleback Church    As a ministry leader at Battle Plan Ministries I am being encouraged by our Elderberry (now called RevBerry) to engage in this 40 days of purpose devotional.  I am going to be in prayer about doing just that.  Katy and I started this devotional in 2003 but thanks to our circumstances we found ourselves not being able to complete it.  Perhaps this would be a great time to engage this study.    Thanks to the folks at  Happy Days and Food Lion  our children were sponsored for Christmas and received many new and exciting toys under the Christmas tree.   Thank YOU Food Lion and Happy Days  for your support once again during Christmas.  I am going to pursue a job at Charleston County as an Emergency Services Dispatcher and have a friend of mine that works in the same building to deliver my application and resume to the director of this department. Pray that I might have favor in this situation and that they will consider hiring me to be a dispatcher.     We wish you a Happy New Year filled with PEACE, LOVE, GOOD HEALTH and JOY for 2004.  God bless

       How many DOGS are there should be the question ?  Lets see, we have Angel and Sammy. They LOVE to bark and carry on because I guess that is something that just comes naturally.  They bark at anything that moves and if they can make something move that normally does not move they will do that and bark anyway.  Once they get bored at creating their own amusement they then bark at Fergus across the street who is Nurse Shannon's dog who has been abandoned in Chuck's yard for the last several years.  Fergus and Sammy and Angel all love to holler back and forth and back and forth all day long if given the opportunity.  I have found that if I schedule a SFE (scheduled flyswatter event) on Sammy's short little body that it tends to cause him to stifle the noise.  Tracking him down and actually hitting him with the flyswatter can be an aerobic event.  The fact that I know I am going to have to chase him around and around the tree sometimes causes me to be lazy and just threaten him from the porch.  Sometimes that works and sometimes it does not.  I am glad that he can not get on the Internet and read my blog.  That would just ruin it for me altogether.  Oh yes, lets not forget the mutts up the street.  They like to bark all hours of the day and night and all that needs to happen to set them off is for the wind to move one single leaf on ANY tree located within 20 square miles of their back yard.  Is it still unlawful to kill someone else's dogs?  Most days I don't want to kill the neighbors dogs (or birds for that matter (snicker)  but I would like to find the mute button.  Can I find some pills that will instantly mute the dogs in the neighborhood?  You know, they open mouth to bark and NO SOUND comes out.  I need to research that immediately.  I thought about buying a dart gun and some tranquilizer darts but that would mean that the event UDE (unscheduled dart extraction) might be seen by a neighbor and then the local police department would have to have an UV event (unscheduled visitation) which we certainly dont need.   Now that I am sharing my lovely story about the CND (canine noise dilemma) I am reminded that atleast one of the children (not mentioning names) (yet) (snicker) from our little commune (SLC) (slumlord commune) down at the bottom of our hill (gully?)  has taken barking lessons from the dogs.  Instead of barking though the child stood in the middle of the street the other day (OMG) (@v@) and screamed  at such a regular and high pitched interval it caused a UCC (unscheduled child chasing) by yours truly.  Luckily for the child I was having visions of all the calories that I was going to have to burn to get off my rear end , put on my shoes and launch myself out the door, across the porch, down the stairs and over the ditch.  Gosh, that would have been worth video taping huh ?  Luckily for me I counted the cost and just inserted my ear plugs (STILL heard the child anyway) and tried to tune them out.    I have to share another event with you.  Are you surprised?  Angel is experiencing a OMGIAIH event (Oh my gosh I am in heat) which in turn has caused a OMGIAHE (Oh my gosh I am horny event) for Sammy.  Things have been interesting around here lately.  Can you imagine Sammy running all around the house chasing Angel for all he is worth with tongue hanging out?  (not going any further with that mental picture @@).  I think that the hormones have gotten to poor Angel though because we saw her turn the tables by starting to chase Sammy around the house and taking on some male tendencies that I probably wont bother with describing.  (@@)  Lets just say that we have had to make sure that we have all had to resort to wearing tennis shoes, knee high socks and knee pads just in case Sammy comes running around the corner of the house and mistakenly identifies one of us as a 60 pound Lab.......  Meanwhile back at the ranch we can see a cloud of dust in the distance as the herd of saber toothed space chickens are headed in our direction.   I can see that Paul Bunyon is going to have to run fetch the gun so we can defend ourselves.....  Maybe Nurse Shannon and the REAL man in her life can learn how to kill and pluck SPACE CHICKENS.........  I wonder if they are edible??

       No, I am not talking about Sammy or Angel even though they do tend to bark on a regular basis.  The dogs I am talking about are my feet who are not very happy with me at the moment.  I spent the last three days working a 3 to 11pm shift at the County Office Building which included making rounds in a 9 story parking garage.  I can not begin to tell you how much fun that was.  NOT.....  I know, I am reminding myself of the fact that it IS a JOB.  I was scheduled to work today from 3pm to 11pm BUT I will be bowling tonight instead.  I advised my company that I go to church Sunday morning and bowl on Monday evening and that I can work OTHER hours during those days.  Nevertheless they scheduled me anyway.  I called the on call supervisor at 6:30 am on Saturday as I was headed to a 7 am to 3pm shift and woke him up to advise him of my NEED to be off today so I can bowl.  He was not too happy that I called him at 6:30 am.  Oh well....  The joys of supervision at a security company.  heheheheheheh  Lets see, now for the fun stuff.  We experienced the following events this morning before we got up to start our day.   UAD =  Unexpected Appliance Death   UTW = Unexpected Trip to Wallyworld UBA =  Unexpected Bill Arrival SHS =  Scheduled Hammering Session   Katy was awakened by our Terrier Sammy at 6 am wanting to experience a UPB (Unscheduled Potty Break) so she got up and let him outside to do his business.  Then Katy attempted to initiate a SCP (Scheduled Coffee Percolation) which failed miserably in a UAD (see above).  That in turn caused Katy to experience a URTPIB (unscheduled Return To Prone Position in Bed) where she lamented the fact that the light was on with the coffee maker but no one was home.  At this point I am awake faced with having an NDC event (NO DARN COFFEE) which in turn meant that I would soon experience a UTW (see above please).  Once we meandered back from WallyWorld I went to the mailbox (huge mistake) and experienced the UBA (see above) and then wandered back down the hill to be advised by Katy that she needed to experience a SHS (see above) so that she could hang some pictures.    I dont know if I can handle any more scheduled or unscheduled events at this point.  Hopefully the coffee will be ready and I can get on with the rest of my day.  LOL....

       The following thoughts are conveyed in the first three chapters of this book.    A. It is not about me but God B.  I am not an accident C. What drives my life ?  At Battle Plan Ministries website at the link listed below we have 160 members and thus far only 6 men have engaged in making a committment to do this devotional for 40 days.  I wrote a message yesterday to encourage the men to take the step and just do it.  I can see where some folks just might be intimidated by the thought of journaling their thoughts, meditations to these devotional chapters in an online log.  Nevertheless, as a leader there I felt compelled to lead by example and to share my thoughts.  My fear is that someone will see me for who I really am as I share my heart.  My HOPE is that everyone will see the real me and my personal pursuit to be who God wants me to be despite my sinful nature.  So, with that in mind I choose to be transparent.  I choose to be that way not to bring attention to who I am but rather to reveal who God is to me and through me.  So, now that I have said that I will begin to share my meditations with you.  I also hope that as you read what I write that you too will receive this as a challenge to buy the book "The Purpose Driven Life"  and join me in your own personal journey.     urlLink The Purpose Driven Life Website    urlLink Battle Plan Ministries                                                                                                                                  40 Days of Purpose     Chapter 1:  It all starts with God    Coll 1:16 for everything, absolutely everything, above and below, visible and invisible, everything got started in him and finds its purpose in him  Point to ponder:   It's not about me   Question to consider:  In spite of all the advertising around me, how can I remind myself that life is really about living for God, not I?    I live in a materialistic world that tells me that I deserve a break today.  If it feels good do it.  Everything about our society is centered on what I can accomplish for myself.  Before Christ I was my own God sitting upon the throne room of my heart.  My meaning and satisfaction and purpose started and ended with my flesh and emotions.  At the point of salvation the Holy Spirit opened my eyes to God the Father and showed me how my sinful nature made me an enemy with my creator and separated me from Him. Through Gods grace I was able to enter into a personal relationship with God and found a new purpose for living.  Instead of satisfying flesh and emotional needs I now desired to fulfill Gods purpose for my life.  My spirit was awakened and given the ability to see Gods love, mercy and character.  The road to sanctification is a daily struggle to remove self off the throne of my heart and to put Christ first.  Christ died so I might live eternally with Him.  God created me for His good pleasure and purpose.  My struggle is to realize that life is not about whom I am or how I feel or how much junk I can accumulate.  The only way that I can connect myself to Gods true purpose for my life is to continually pursue Him through prayer, reading of His word and being obedient to His bidding.       Chapter 2:  I am not an accident   Verse- Isaiah 44:2 - I am your creator. You were in my care even before you were born.    Question to consider- Knowing that God uniquely created me what areas of my personality, background and physical appearance am I struggling to accept.    I sometimes struggle with the fact that I want to pursue people in deep personal relationships and very few folks make an effort to get beyond the superficial aspects of daily living.  I want to talk about matters of the heart and it tends to scare people off.  I tend to be strongly opinionated and I call things for what they are.  I know the importance of tact and being politically correct but my Christ view usually conflicts with the normal worldview of most people.  That typically puts me in a position of being separate from others and lonely.  I sometimes wish I was not a people person.       Chapter 3:  Living on purpose is the path to peace.     Isaiah 26:2-  You Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm and put their trust in you.  Question to consider- what would my family and friends say is the driving force of my life.  What do I want it to be?     I think that my family and friends would say that my family and being religious are the two driving forces in my life.  I have a handful of family members who view my church activities and Christ view of my world as being super religious.  They do not understand that my religious activities and Christ view has been born out of years of sanctification and trials by fire.  I can look back at my life and see several instances where my life was driven by fear, resentment and anger and need for approval.  Every since I was 17 years old and God entered into my heart I have wanted to serve Him in any way that I can.  I used to perceive serving God as something that could only be done in the context of full time ministry in a traditional church setting.  As I lived through the consequences of divorce in the Southern Baptist Convention I had a rude awakening about ministry.  I was told that I was not good enough for ministry because of my divorce.  I was shown by God that I could serve him on a personal level in my life and that my faith and obedience in the non traditional moments of ministry were able to touch the lives of people in the community all around me.  God showed me that He could use me for the purpose of glorifying His Kingdom without being licensed or ordained.  God showed me the importance of ministry to my family first and then the church and community.  I am learning that when I look outside of myself for Gods purpose and desire in the community and lives of people around me that as I engage in these activities God reveals His purpose for me personally.  I am also learning that when I seek Gods purpose that when I find it the experiences is not always emotionally charged.  I must pursue God daily on a personal level without requiring God to make me feel good or do something in my life to make me happy.  I have also learned that it is easier to be in survival mode living life reacting to circumstances instead of living life proactively with a planned out purpose.

       It appears that I have been successful in ripping out the Blogspeak code and inserting the new Haloscan code and republished my Blog Site.  I have not had the time to look at the functionality of Haloscan so hopefully it is as user friendly as what Blogspeak provided for us.  I also hope that Haloscan does not charge for this service.  If they do the functionality will be coming back out.    What a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  I almost wish I was on the 5k run with the rest of the ATHLETES this morning.  Just the thought of running down the street makes my heart skip a beat.  actually, if I did try to run down the street my heart would probably just explode and they would have to call 911 for the beached whale lying in the middle of Meeting street.  I guess I will just stick to walking the parking garage for exercise and maybe next year I can think about something more strenuous.  LOL....

       Good morning world!!  It is a nice crisp 32 degrees in Downtown Charleston this morning and I am coming to you live from the Charleston County Office building where I work Saturday from 7 am to 3pm.  Apparently there is a 5k run that kicked off this morning on Meeting street so that means that I am not the only one that is awake this morning.   I got an e-mail from a service called Halonscan which apparently has taken over the hosting for Blogspeak Blog comments.  Harry wrote his blogspeak customers and told us that his hosting ended sooner than he expected and Haloscan has taken over those responsibilities.  I will probably need to add some code to the Blogger template before the comments section will come back on my blog.  The blog entries that were on blogspeak were imported into Haloscan so once I add this functionality to my blog your comments will show up again.  I am on day 17 of the 40 days of purpose devotional which is from The Purpose Driven Life series by Rick Warren. I will post some more of those entries soon.  Have you gone through this devotional series yet?  If not I would highly recommend your doing so.    Katy and normally would be in Myrtle Beach SC on a Renissance Weekend get away hosted by Happy Days and Special Times in Charleston but I have to work weekends now.  So, priorities and responsibility sucks.  Instead of being in Myrtle Beach I am working which in and of itself is a good thing considering I spent most of 2003 unemployed.  I am still pretty much broke but atleast I can pay a bill here or there and child support is being paid and I am staying out of jail for now.  THAT is a HUGE benefit along with the health benefits of walking around in a 9 story parking garage once an hour.  Who said life was not fun.   LOL....  Ok, speaking of work perhaps I need to quit flying this keyboard and start my next round.    Have a good weekend.

      Ok, Haloscan is nice especially since it is  free.  However, I do not get  email notification  of  WHEN  someone leaves a  comment on one of my blog entries .  That sort of bites...  Oh well, maybe one day when finance pick up a little bit I can afford to upgrade to their premium service and get all the bells and whistles...  New England Patriots are favored as winners by 6 points against the Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII.  Silly people... Dont they know that the Panthers are going to BURY the Patriots under a rock.... LOL....  I am off Monday and I am SO looking forward to it.  What am I going to do on my day off?  I borrowed a pressure washer from a friend and I am planning on washing all the green junk off of this trailer.  The trailer has been LONG over due for a bubble bath.  I probably wont have any bubbles but the pressure washer will knock that junk right off of it.  Wahoooo  the house will go from GREEN to GREY in a matter of hours.  Neat huh?  Monday night is always a treat since that is the night that I attempt to hit the head pin and knock down all 10 pins at once.  Last week I bowled a 156 average in three games and the week before I bowled a 152 average.  Considering that I have a 129 average for the League I am getting better as time progresses.  Too cool!!  My goal is to bowl several games over 200 so I can add to my ABC patch collection.    Have you ever used Incredimail?  Go to http://www.incredimail.com and download their email client.  A friend of mine is using it and has had a lot of FUN with it.  So, I was encouraged to give it a try.  The last time I used it I had some technical difficulties that I just decided not to live with so I went back to Outlook.  I still have everything backed up in Outlook and I still like the PIM functionality of the application so it will never go away completely.  Incredimail is cool because it has all sorts of email stationary, animations etc etc.  Check it out!!  Captain Kangaroo died at the age of 76.  Children all over the world are mourning that death.  Ok, maybe not children today, perhaps the baby boomers are feeling the grief more?  I found out today that the Martian rover is having hardware and software failures.  Apparently the darn thing must be running American hardware and the Operating System must be Microsoft Windoze.  LOL...  They are saying that the darn thing has been rebooting itself 60 times in a specific time period.  I forget what the time period is but I wonder if it has a screen that shows the Blue Screen of Death every time it goes to reboot itself?  I think the project cost something along the lines of 4 million dollars.  That figure seems sort of low actually.  Anyway, what a shame.  We landed it, it crawled off the launch pad , sent back some cool pictures, sampled some soil and found evidence of water and then died.....  I wonder if the second rover that is about to land will die as quickly?  I hope it had Linux Redhat installed on it and not Mickeysoft.....  Have you purchased The Purpose Driven Life book yet?  If not, why not?  LOL....  Wow, this is an incredible book... I highly recommend it to ANYONE that wants to give their spiritual walk a super charged boost.  How many books do you read, put on the bookshelf and then forget the contents or worse yet do not allow the contents to change you for the better?  Does that sound like something we do to our bibles?  We take it off the shelf, dust it off and then take it to church every Sunday.  What do we do with it during the other 6 days of the week?  Does what we read in the pages of our bible change us from the inside out ?    Once you have finished the 40 Days of Purpose in the Purpose Driven life book then I would recommend your picking up a copy of the Purpose Driven church.  I am reading that book as well and while it is geared for pastors and lay leadership everyone in the church ought to read it.

       Day 19-  Community requires commitment     Verse - We understand that love is when we realize that Christ give his life for us.  That means we must give our lives for other believers.  1 John 3:16    Question to consider -  how can I help cultivate today the characteristics of real community in my small group and my church?   Cultivating community takes the following:   Commitment Honesty Humility Courtesy Confidentiality Frequency    The following statements stood out to me as I was reading this chapter about each characteristic mentioned above.     HONESTY    We cultivate fellowship in our community with the choices and commitments we make.  You will have to care enough to lovingly speak the truth  Real fellowship depends on frankness  The tunnel of conflict is the passageway to intimacy in any relationship  Thoughtless words leave lasting wounds.    HUMILITY    Self importance, smugness, and stubborn pride destroy fellowship  Humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less.  Humility is thinking more of others.    COURTESY   Respecting our differences Considerate of others feelings Patient with people who irritate us  Community has nothing to do with compatibility The basis for our fellowship is our relationship to God   CONFIDENTIALITY   Only in a safe environment of warm acceptance and trusted confidentiality will people open up and share their deepest hurts, needs and mistakes.   Gossip is spread by wicked people, they stir up trouble and break friendships. Proverbs 16:28   FREQUENCY   You must have frequent, regular contact with your group in order to build genuine fellowship.    Relationships take time    A small group covenant should include the following characteristics    Share true feelings -  authenticity Encourage each other - mutuality Support each other - sympathy Forgive each other - mercy Speak the truth in love- honesty Admit our weaknesses - humility Respect our differences - courtesy Not gossip - confidentiality  Make the group priority - frequency   Fellowship means giving up our self centeredness and independence in order to become interdependent.   The way that I can cultivate the characteristics of community is by practicing each of them in every relationship that I have.  That will take some courage on my part because ti will mean that I will need the Holy Spirit to enlighten me as to which characteristic is missing in the relationships that I have. I will need to practice courtesy with those people who are fearful or scared of going to a deeper level with their relationship.  Perhaps I have already been practicing honesty and humility and that might be what scares people off.  I desire deep and meaningful relationships. I want to give  and encourage others and I need to be willing to receive these characteristics of community in return.    It is always easier to practice these on others but not so fun to allow others to extend the same to me.  It is easier to focus on known failures and weaknesses but a bit painful for someone to speak truth about something I am not immediately aware of.  Receiving truth into ones soul can take enormous amounts of courage and humility.  I feel that I need to grow in the areas of mercy, courtesy and frequency.   As I study this book I am painfully aware that I am lacking in true biblical fellowship or community in my life with regards to a small group or the local church where I serve.  Community and biblical fellowship only happens superficially.  The largest common denominator for our church body is time.  We get together 2 hours per week at the most.  You can not expect community or deep meaningful relationships to happen in a corporate environment.  I am also reminded of the fact that there is a difference between the attendees at our church and the church membership who have made a commitment to play their part in the ministry at our church.    The scariest part of all of this is that I am fearful that if I were to start advertising the need for folks in our church to read this book that one of two things will happen.  The first thing would be that some people will read this book and nothing will change externally.  In other words, they will probably get something out of the words in the book but it will not move them enough to make changes.  Perhaps that is because they as a church attendee are happy with the status quo and don't want to see anything change. The church attendee may be in a rut and comfortable with what is going on.  The second type of person will look at the book as an attack against tradition and the denominational culture they have been raised in. They will see my promotion of this book as pointing a finger and rocking the boat.    What good is knowledge if it is not applied to our lives and changes made?  Would someone please get me a LARGE bandage?

       Day 17-  I am called to belong not just to believe     Verse to remember-  In Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.  Romans 12:5    Question to consider-  Does my level of involvement in my local church demonstrate that I love and am committed to Gods family?    The following principles taught within this chapter are very important and a good reminder to me as I learn how to focus HOW I am involved in helping to build the church through ministry to fellow believers.  I believe that I am very involved in what Christ is doing to build the local church we are attending.  My wife and I are committed to using the gifts that God has given us to bless others in any way that we can.  However as my understanding of WHAT ministry and worship really is I am learning HOW to GROW my perspective of ministry and what I can do to be better at what God has called me to do.     The Church meets the five deepest needs:      Purpose to live for People to live with Principles to live by Profession to live out Power to live on    Gods purposes for his church are identical to his five purposes for you     Worship helps you to "focus on God" Fellowship helps you to " face life's problems" Discipleship helps you to "fortify your faith" Ministry helps you to  "find your talents" Evangelism helps you to "fulfill your mission"   " The difference between being a church attendees and a church member is commitment.  Attendees are spectators from the sidelines, members get involved in the ministry. "  " Jesus has not promised to build your ministry , he has promised to build his church"  We are commanded to do the following "one anothers"   Love Pray Encourage Admonish Greet Serve Teach Accept Honor Bear burdens Forgive Submit Devoted   " Today's culture of independent individualism has created many spiritual orphans - "bunny believers" - who hop around from one church to another without any identity, accountability or commitment. "     Day 18- I need others in my life     Verse -  share each others troubles and problems, and in this way obey the law of Christ.  Gal 6:2     Question to consider -  What one step can I take today to connect with another believer at a more genuine, heart to heart level?   The following Quotes from this chapter stands out for me.   "self-pity dries up sympathy for others" "you cant have fellowship without forgiveness" "you must make allowances for each others faults and forgive the person who offends you.  Remember , the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others"  Col 3:13  The best way for me to connect to others for the purpose of genuine fellowship is for me to invest more time into the lives of people around me.  I need to make myself available and encourage others to find the time to connect with me.  The oly agenda that I should have during these times of connecting is to be open to whatever the Holy Spirit leads us.  Listening to others and allowing them to share their heart is a powerful way to build trust and further communications.  I need to be more willing to look beyond any obvious rough edges or obvious sin so that I might see the good things in a person that will allow us to have something in common and make a connection.  It is so much easier to seek out people with the same interests and commonalities.  God created each one of us with such diversity and just because someone is not just like me does not mean that their differences are bad or negative.

       Day 16-  Life is all about Love  Verse to remember-  The entire law is summed up in a single command. Love your neighbor as yourself.  Galatians 5:14  Question to consider -  Honestly, are my relationships my first priority?  How can I ensure they are?      Relationships are high on the priority list but probably not at the very top.  I am a people person and I thrive being around people.  I have been told that "people do not know how to take me" so perhaps I am not the type of person that folks want to surround themselves with.  I love interacting with people but I am not social butterfly.  I do not thrive on superficial blather.  I do not mind breaking the ice and talking about trivial things to get further in a conversation but once I learn that the folks are not willing to talk about "heart matters"  I can get bored pretty quickly.  I also have a problem with saying what is on my mind when it gets there.  I usually do not pull any punches and while I understand how important it is to be politically correct and tactful I still have some work at knowing when to be that way and when not to be that way.  A friend told me that I get too deep too fast.  I get too up front and personal and in your face too quickly in relationships.  I have been told that I expect way too much out of a relationship.  I guess that I am the type of person that you either love or you hate.  People that are more skilled at relationships than myself and have the ability to look beyond my rough edges are able to find out who the REAL me is and they sometimes choose to stick around.  For those folks like myself that find it difficult to look past the irritating , frustrating rough edges of others I guess they just blow me off and get out of the way.  I need to take a lesson from that thought in that I too need to find a way to be more patient with irritating, frustrating people with rough edges.  I have not arrived nor am I perfect and without fault.  How can I expect everyone else to be perfected and able to provide perfect harmony with me when I am not?  The toughest part of love is learning to love the unlovable.  It is so much easier to love someone that has the same priorities, drive, ambitions, faith etc.  Unselfish love is that which takes a sacrifice to deliver.  Only through the power of God can we find that "Phileo" love that only He can give to reach out and love someone that is difficult to approach for whatever reasons.    The only way that I can ensure that relationships are my top priority is to examine how I spend my time.  What I spend my time on the most is what I love. I need to evaluate how I spend my time and remove some of the "time eaters" that rob me of valuable relationships.  I find that I spend a lot of time going between the computer and the television set.  I lovingly call the TV the "idiot box" because it allows me to disengage my brain  and allow myself to be "entertained".  Instead of being entertained I need to use some of that time more responsibly by developing closer relationships with my wife and children.  I do not consider myself to be emotionally absent like some fathers we might know but I do need to find activities and moments of down time that I can appropriate to spend with my family.  I can show my family more love by spending more time with them and getting to know them better.  As for relationships outside of the family unit I need to pray and ask God to show me those people that I can invest my time in.  I need to be a "Paul"  in the life of a younger man who might need to be mentored and I also need to put myself in the position of being a "Timothy" to a man older and wiser than myself that can mentor me.  I spend some quality time via the Internet investing time into the lives of men through e-mail and bulletin board systems.  I need to spend more time away from the Internet and more time investing my life with others in the community in real life that God has placed me in.

         Chapter 10-  The heart of worship is surrender  Verse to remember-  surrender your whole being to him to be used for righteous purposes  Romans 6:13b  Question to consider-  what area of my life am I holding back from God?     Several quotes from this chapter got my attention     "There are three barriers that block our total surrender to God; fear, pride and confusion."  "to have complete control - is the cause of so much stress in our lives.  We struggle with God."  "You know you re surrendered to God when you rely on God to work things out instead of trying to manipulate others, force your own agenda and control the situation."  "surrender yourself to the Lord, and wait patiently for him."  "the most difficult area to surrender for many people is their money"     As I think about lack of faith and trust equating to not surrendering totally to God I think of my past and some of the issues or circumstances that I can look back at.    In the past 24 years I have worked in the following occupations and held positions within the occupations.   Psychiatric Technician EMT and Nursing assistant Roofer Longshoreman/ Stevedore Security/ Law Enforcement Information Technology  In the last 24 years I have been married twice with my current marriage lasting almost 14 years and going strong.  Due to the last 15 years having been spent in Information Technology and because I spent 8 years in Law Enforcement we have moved at least 24 times or maybe more.  Is there no wonder that I want to settle down in one occupation and live in the same location for longer than 2 to 3 years?  I/ we feel that we need stability.  Our children need stability.  All these years I have attempted to find steady and lasting employment.  Perhaps my lack of a college degree has something to do with that?  My parents tried to teach me the importance of having a college degree when I was still living at home but in all my wisdom (at the age of 18) I yearned to be outside of their realm of authority and influence and wanted to be my own man and do my own thing.  So I dropped out of RN school and did my own thing.    When I was in my early 20's I felt a very strong calling to ministry.  I did not feel called to pastor a church but rather to Christian ministry.  After my divorce and coming from the SBC denomination all hopes of ministry were flushed down the toilet.  At the age of 42 I look back at the last 24 years  and wonder if I have been rebellious in more than one area of my life.  I became a Christian at the age of 17 when I asked Christ into my heart out in the woods of Quinlan Texas as one of my friends father led me to a saving knowledge of Christ by a chopping block.  I began to understand the need for Christ to be the Lord of everything in my life and not just my fire insurance card when I was in my mid 20's.  When I compare my life to other friends that I know it appears as if they have their life in order and my life appears to be a ship wreck floating out in the harbor.    Waiting on the Lord and surrendering my will to God has been a pursuit since I got serious about the Lord being Lord of all.  I spent quite a few years trying to figure out how and why I needed to quit making decisions through intuition and gut feelings.  I have a natural tendency to be spontaneous  and do things on the fly.  I guess that I have always equated success to having stability and that stability would equate to stable income and finances and that would guarantee  a safe and secure family.  Perhaps I still need to learn how to totally surrender all and let go of the things of this word, especially its wisdom and let God do what He wants with my life.       Chapter 11 -  God wants to be my best friend  Verse to remember-  Friendship with God is reserved for those who reverence him.  Question to consider -  What can I do  to remind myself to think about God and talk to him more often throughout my day.        I spent a lot of time doing activities and tasks that require me to tune in with the Holy Spirit  and converse with God and meditate on his word or research what Gods word says about a specific topic.  The following statements from the book have special emphasis.      "if you are seeking an experience of his presence through all of this, you have missed the point. We don't praise God to feel good, but to do good.  Your goal is not a feeling, but a continual awareness of the reality that God is always present.  That is the lifestyle of worship."      So to become a BEST friend of God I need to learn how to perfect the skill of talking with God about every day tasks or events as well as meditating more on his word.  I find that the worries of this world can sometimes overwhelm me and drag me down into the pit of helplessness or give me the feeling of hopelessness.  Instead of allowing the circumstances to control how I feel through emotional responses I need to learn how to consciously channel those things to God and ask him how to deal with them.  Sometimes I spend so much time during quiet time repenting of sin and fearing God that I forget that God wants me to be his best friend.  God cares about every single detail of my life.  I  know that but somehow I still compartmentalize God with regards to WHEN I spent quiet time or let him into my life.      Day 12-  I am as close to God as I choose to be.    Verse to remember -  Draw close to God, and God will draw close to you.  James 4:8  Question to consider - What practical choices will I make today in order to grow closer to God.        The following comments in the book are of importance.      "You must work at developing your friendship with God." "I must choose to be honest with God."  "Complete honesty- about your faults and feelings. "  "Bitterness is the greatest barrier to friendship with God."  "I must choose to value what God values".        There are times during my typical day that I am aware of God but I am passive in regards to communicating with him.  I need to quit seeking to be emotionally happy and constantly entertained during moments of down time.  Instead of doing something just to pass the time and experience momentary pleasure I need to pursue God passionately.  Prayer, meditation and talking to God honestly about my feelings on a regular basis and not just when it is my scheduled quiet time with God.  God desires to be a full time friend and not someone that needs to fill a time slot in my Day Timer.       Day 13 - God wants all of me  Verse to remember -  Love the lord your God with all your hart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.  Mark 12:30  Question to consider -  Which is more pleasing to God right now-  My public worship or my private worship.       When I originally wrote my answer I missed the "MY" portion of public or private worship and thought it was asking "which" form of worship was more pleasing to God.  I will go ahead and run with my thoughts on that question and then answer the original question below.  My thoughts on WHICH type of worship is more important to God.    I believe that God is interested in both private and public worship.  I also believe that God looks past our method of worship and examines our motives for worship.  As this chapter and book states the acts of worship are far more diverse than just singing choruses of music on Sunday morning.  God wants us to worship Him thoughtfully, authentically and passionately.  I have to remember that when I make an effort to minimize my desires and wants and put the needs of God and other first and foremost that I will have many different ways to worship God.  I have always said that a tithe is much more than 10% of my income.  I believe that our tithe and or worship is time, talents and money.   My thoughts on "MY" private and public worship.  I believe that MY definition of worship has been radically changed by reading the definition that is given in this book.  I believe now as I look back that there have been times when I thought that I did not worship God in a pleasing way that in fact there have been times that I have worshiped him both publicly and privately and have brought a smile to his face.  I think that there are times when I am in the spot light of public ministry no matter what role I might be playing that I am more conscious of how I APPEAR to others than I should be.  I have always attempted to be sincere and authentic with my worship and have never had a problem with being REAL or passionate.  Where I need to improve with regards to worship both publicly and privately would be to seek out new opportunities for worship now that I have a NEW definition of WHAT worship really is.  It is much more than what happens on Sunday morning or during a specified church program.       Day 14 - God is real, no matter how I feel  Verse to remember -  For God has said, I will never leave you, I will never abandon you. Heb 13:5  Question to consider - How can I stay focused on God's presence, especially when he feels distant?     The following statements had special meaning and relevance in my life.   "God is real, no matter how you feel"  "But circumstances are not always pleasant"  "The deepest level of worship is praising God in spite of pain, thanking God during at trial, trusting him when tempted, surrendering while suffering, and loving him when he seems distant"  "We grieve Gods spirit and quench our fellowship with him by disobedience, conflict with others, busyness, friendship with the world and other sins."  "God can handle your doubt, anger, fear, grief, confusion and questions"      I can attest to the fact that my circumstances in the last three years have played havoc with my emotions and at times my faith.  I could relate to Job even though my trials were not as severe nor did my faith always reflect his total trust in God.  My trust in God was seated in total ignorance of my circumstances and a loss to know what else to do other than to cling to what I knew.  I knew I keep coming back to the statement that the "purpose" is not about me but it is about God.  It is so much easier to be obedient, fruitful, content and happy when the circumstances of life are going my way.  When I continually seek to be emotionally satisfied I limit my perception of Gods desires to my immediate circumstances and how I feel about them.  I can allow those situations to rob me of my joy.    I can stay focused on Gods presence by doing the following.   A.	Communicate with God and tell him how I feel B.

       Chapter 4 - Made to last forever - Thinking about my purpose.     Point to ponder - There is more to life than just here and now     Verse to remember- 1 John 2:17 - This world is fading away, along with everything it craves.  But if you do the will of God, you will live forever.       Question to consider-  Since I was made to last forever, what is the one thing I should stop doing and the one thing I should start doing today.  The following quote from page 37 struck  a chord with me.     " When you fully comprehend that there is no more to life than just here and now, and you realize that life is just preparation for eternity you will begin to live differently.  You will start living in the light of eternity, and that will color how you handle every relationship, task and circumstance.  The closer you live to God, the smaller everything else appears."   I have heard of people that were so heavenly minded that they were of no earthly good.  We are in this world, passing through and aliens to the worldview around us. Perhaps there needs to be more of a balance. Maybe we are so earth centric  that we loose sight of eternity.  One of the things I need to stop doing is to stop limiting myself with regards to my mental or spiritual potential.  How many years have I wasted in ministry because I bought into the church mindset that says only licensed and ordained ministers are qualified to "minister".  I need to stop filtering my spiritual and ministry purpose through the light of denominational legalism and cultural and/or tradition.  I know that I have not been called to the office of a Pastor.  However there are other spiritual gifts within the body that do not require me to be a pastor, ordained or licensed.  What do I need to start doing?  I need to start becoming more radical with my faith.  I need to be more willing to take some risks.  I need to quit worrying about my personal security bubble or whether my being spiritually fruitful for God will infringe on my creature comforts.  How ill the hurting and spiritually dying and ignorant ever know about Christ if I do not tell them?  How many people in the community that God has placed me in are lacking or hurting or headed for hell because I am not willing to take a risk?  What is more important in life?  Is it being politically correct and making sure you don't upset someone or is it more important to deliver the good news of Christ in a spirit of love, compassion and humility?  I need to start being more effective with every resource (time, talent and money) at my disposal to becoming fruitful for Christ.        Chapter 5:    Point to Ponder:  Life is a Test and Trust  Verse to remember: Luke 16:10 a- Unless you are faithful in small matters you wont be faithful in large ones.    Questions to consider:  What has happened for me recently that I realize was a test from God?  What are the greatest matters God has entrusted to me?      Recently my life metaphor has been viewed as survival.  Katy and I have found ourselves going day by day reacting to the stress, trials and tribulations with the mindset of surviving.  "We are in survival mode"  has been our response when folks asked "how are you doing?".  I like to say " I am"  vs I am not, or "one day at a time" meaning that I am hoping to just survive that day with its crisis and make it to the next one.  I like the following statements on page 43.  " God tests my faith through problems, tests my hope by how I handle possessions, and tests my love through people."  "God left him alone to test his character to reveal a weakness, and to prepare him for more responsibility".  "Most people fail to realize that money is both a TEST and a TRUST from God.  How many times in my life have I realized that God did not bless me with more than what He has because I probably could not be trusted with it.  OUCH!!!!  Recently I would say that God has been testing me through the loss of a child to cancer and the loss of regular income and employment. The greatest matters that God has entrusted to me are the following.   To be faithful and obedient despite my circumstances  To be the type of husband that Katy needs, one who is a spiritual leader, Christ like and less selfish  To be a good father to my children and reflect the character of God to them through my actions.  To be faithful and fruitful in ministry both online as well as the local church.      Chapter 6:  - This world is not our own  Verse to remember - So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but what is unseen.  For what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal. 2 Corinthians 4:18  Question to consider- How should the fact that life on earth is just a temporary assignment change the way I am living right now?     The first thing it should do is change my perspective of life.  My life metaphor should change.  I should begin to invest my time, money and talents into things that have eternal value. I need to invest in my family, my local church.  I need to equip my children to be aware of their purpose and how to be able to recognize that purpose and walk it out in practical ways.  I need to quit worrying about what standards that other people judge me with.  I should be more passionate about other people knowing Christ on a personal level.       Chapter 7- It is all for HIM  Verse to remember - For everything comes from God alone.  Everything lives by his power, and everything is for his glory.  Romans 11:6  Question to consider - Where in my daily routine can I become more aware of Gods glory?      On page 54 we are reminded of the following need with regards to God's Glory.  " We are commanded to recognize his glory, honor his glory, declare his glory, praise his glory, reflect his glory, and life for his glory."  I can recognize the glory of God on my daily routine by being more aware of those things, events or people who reflect the glory of God.  Sometimes it is easy for me to compartmentalize God in my life.  In other words there are scheduled moments in time where I focus primarily on the character of God and pursuing him in Christian disciplines and activities.  Then if I allow myself to get entangled in the things of this world I begin to loose sight of the importance of viewing my world through the eyes of a believer.  When I view a situation in life I can either look for Gods glory in it or I can look for opportunities to use that situation as a way to make me more secure, comfortable or happy.  I need to spend more time pursuing the glory of God present in other people and do less measuring of them through my world view.  If I only see the negative, bad or faulty side of a person then I will be blond to what God things are present in that person reflecting Gods glory.  I need to be less condemning and critical of myself and allow God to show me his glory reflecting through those things he has done in my life through the years.  I need to slow down and re evaluate all of my life centric tasks  so that I can be in a position to take the time to find Gods glory and enjoy him to the fullest.   The following brings Glory to God   We bring Glory to God by worshipping Him.   "God wants our worship to be motivated by love, thanksgiving, and delight, not duty".  How many years have I spent viewing the act of worship as what we do on Sunday morning before the sermon when we sing praise and worship music?  This book tells me that I can worship God in these ways and bring God glory when I do them.  We are reminded that worship is a lifestyle of enjoying God, loving Him, and giving ourselves to be used for His purposes.   We bring Glory to God by loving other believers  The book states "Christ is not just a matter of believing; it also includes belonging and learning to love the family of God."  Loving the family of God takes time, sacrifice and a willingness to extend grace and mercy to both the loveable and the unlovable.  We find it so easy to love those people whom have the same ideals, philosophies, lifestyles and doctrine.  How can we extend grace, mercy and love to those children of God whom we struggle to identify with because we perceive some rough edges?  We bring glory to God by becoming like Christ  That is easier said than done. The process of sanctification should happen on a daily basis and it usually requires that I exit my comfort zone and take some risks  that will test my faith.  2 Corinthians 5:17 describes this daily process.    We bring glory to God by serving others with our gifts  The book tells us "Each of us was uniquely designed by God with talents, gifts, skills and abilities"  "God did not give you your abilities for selfish purposes."     We bring glory to God by telling others about him.   We bring glory to God by telling others about him.  Why do we fail to tell people about who Jesus is?  Are we ashamed of God are we afraid someone may ask you a tough question or even worse ridicule your faith?  Are we too busy earning money to pay for our extravagant lifestyles and that leaves no spare time to share the good news of Christ with our neighbors and friends?  I need to purpose in my heart each day to find creative ways to inject some passion and enthusiasm into my life so that people will want to know more about my Jesus.  How can I tell anyone about my Jesus when I allow the circumstances of my life to rob me of my joy in the Lord and his promises?  The answer is I can not share the joy of the Lord or his good news when I am constantly focusing on negative circumstances.      Chapter 8 -  I was planned for Gods pleasure  Verse-  The Lord takes pleasure in his people  Psalms 149:4  Question -  What common task  could I start doing as if I were doing it directly for Jesus?     The two things that come to mind would be work and domestic duties around the house.  As a husband  and father when I manage to find the desire to do domestic chores I know that I am serving my family.  If I were to do those tasks as if unto the Lord then it would be an act of worship as well.  My work can be an act of worship  if Christ is the center focus of how and why I do what I do to earn money.  I am an ambassador for Christ in the workplace and if I view my job as a way to serve and worship God and my fellow man then God will be pleased.       Chapter 9 -  God smiles when I trust him  Verse to remember-  The Lord is pleased with those who worship him and trust his love.  Psalms 147:11  Question to consider -  Since God knows what is best, in what areas of my life do I need to trust him most?      I need to trust God more in the area of finances.  I need to trust God more with regards to my circumstances.  I need to trust God more with regards to believing His word that states that those that trust in Him as Lord and Savior will be in Heaven.  As I walk through the grief process  of loosing a child to cancer I sometimes struggle with having faith to believe that I will see Jessica again one day.  I have been told by other Christian brothers that I have trust issues so maybe I need to trust God to give me the ability to trust other people and their motives and intentions.  I tend to react with the spirit of being from the "show me state".  You show me you have pure intentions through your actions and then I will believe you.  I suppose that is why trust and faith go hand in hand.

         I WAS going to share BEFORE and AFTER pictures of the "cleaning" experience BUT someone "family" had 51 images sitting on the digital camera and it was OUT of memory to add more.  #$%^%$&*(*&^%$.  Somehow, I am the ONLY person in this family that knows HOW to remove the pictures off the camera and export them to the main computer....          ANYWAY, I did my thing today and transferred the older pictures off the camera and made room for the new ones. The following pictures are the AFTER pictures of a clean doublewide trailer.  Wahooooo   I know, I need to take the mattress and bed fram leaning up against the porch to the county dump.... I will do it soon!!!

      I posted this in our Happy Days and Special Times Yahoo group just now and thought I would share it....    Dont tell anyone BUT I am cooking my own breakfast. I can not remember the last time I attempted this. It is funny but I watched the cat "sparkles" sneak up on the pan that had the Jimmy Deans MILD sausage sitting waiting to be cooked.  She did not seem to have a taste for raw sausage.  haahahahahaha  Who is smarter, man or cat? I can hear the laughter now.... I captured aforementioned feline and tossed her outside.  Little did I know she made a bee line for the open window by the STOVE.  Guess who pops in for ANOTHER visit for the biscuits?  Guess who got whopped upside the noggin and recaptured?  Yes, sparkles was seeing stars and landed on the front porch and I made a bee line for the second window asap....  It is AMAZING what you will eat when you are hungry.... Yes, I am eating my own cooking. I hope I survive....  Hey ladies. Riddle me this....  I guess I should have said, Riddle me this batgirls....  Why does Katy leave broken egg shells IN the carton with the rest of the GOOD eggs?  Why is it when I banged the egg on the stove this morning it did not break at first?  Stubborn Egg or just Food Lion eggs are tougher than the typical egg?  Are they feeding the chickens too much iron or what?  Dont tell Katy but I got her the most favorite thing in the whole wide world. If you were to seperate her from this one drink she would have to be admitted to the psyche ward at MUSC.. 1 Point for James!  Yeah....  Good thing I dont have to buy diamonds or provide an endless supply of cash to make this woman happy...  Well, sometimes she does want software for the computer....    Question.  How many of you power washed your trailer in the FREEZING Cold yesterday?  Raise your hand so I can get a head count..... You dont live in a trailer?  You are not stupid enough to go out in the freezing cold to power wash your trailer?  Well, I guess I was the only one to do this.  Our trailer was transformed from something that looked like it came out of a Boggy Creek Monster Movie to a sparkling light grey double wide.  It only took me 2.5 hours and two layers of clothing to finish the front.  Luckily for me I had 4 layers of clothes on and two sets of gloves.  I looked like the Coca Cola bear all dressed up for the Artic.    It must have been quite a spectacle actually. The next door neighbor's children kept making trips out to watch me commit this total act of lunacy.  They problem went home and told their mother that my mother never taught me to stay in out of the freezing cold and not play with water.    Yesterday was my first day off in about two weeks. I was faced with two options.  Stay in the house and be depressed about junk in my life or just forget about it and go do something. I voted to ditch the depression mode and just go do something that I could actually accomplish.  Have you ever been there?  Well I was there yesterday and even though I looked silly and froze my proverbial tail off I atleast did something productive and have something to show for it.   No, I am not finishing the POWER WASH the trailer task today. I get to work 3 to 11pm tonight in the freezing cold as I baby sit the parking garage down at the County Office Buildings for Charleston County on Meeting street. No, I do not have to stay in the cold. I actually only spend 30 min per hour out in the parking garage. PTL for that.  Can you imagine finding someone in a stairwell curled up asleep because that is the warmest place you can find to sleep?  Just when I thought my life had pathetic moments.    Ok, what are YOU doing right now and why have you NOT been posting in here?  I know, you are busy. All of us are busy.  We also need each other.  Share your wacky stories with us so we can LAUGH... God, KNOWS we all need to laugh.... There are too many horrible things going on for us to CRY about. If you are happy tell us. If you are DEPRESSED, for goodness sake , share it with us so we can all be depressed TOGETHER.  AFter all misery LOVES company.  Just promise me you wont stay that way for long.  That really sucks.  Ok, are you having a PITY party?  Are your children driving you crazy?  Are they eating you out of house and home and feeding the neighborhood children the REST of what is left in the pantry?    Hope to hear from you soon.... Yeah that is YOU....  Love ya Katy, Kristina, Justin, Jeremy and Jessica...  Yes, I love YOU tooo.....  Hugs

      Actually winter has been upon us for atleast 30 days if not longer.  Temperatures have gotten down to 26 degrees thus far and last night they were forcasting feezing rain and sleet.  Luckily for us the ground temperatures were at 44 degrees so the rain we got did not stick and freeze.  Schools out in Orangeburg County close as well as technical colleges but Charleston County, Berkeley County and Dorchester County schools are open for business as usual.  I cant tell you how disappointed the rug rats were this morning when we opened the door and pointed the way to the school bus.    I had a day off yesterday for the first time in two weeks.  Wahooooo!  I was bummed out a bit about stuff and so I decided I would not spend my day depressed in the cold.  I still spent the day in cold temperatures but since I had already borrowed the commercial pressure washer from a friend of mine I bundled up into four layers of clothing and washed the green slime off of our trailer.  I managed to get 2 layers of the clothing soaking wet and after 2.5 hours of FUN the trailer turned from green to light grey again.  It really looks so much nicer clean.  LOL....  I finished washing the trailer on the front side and no sooner had I put everything up and changed clothes did it start to sprinkle.  I was surprised by UPS arriving with a package for me.  Inside I found two packages of French Vanilla coffee.  Yum Yum... What a treat that was.  Then the rain REALLY started coming down.  Yuk and double Yuk.... The second WONDERFUL event yesterday that helped to beat off depression is that two of my FRIENDS worked out a deal where I could get a Compaq Ipaq Pocket PC with tons of accessories to go with it for the incredible price of 120.00.  I would imagine that with all of the goodies and the Pocket PC that I would have had to pay around 350.00 to 400.00 for everything.  Thanks to my friends I will have this newest TOY in the next day or two and I did not have to pay for it.  Wahoooooo.  What the heck IS a Pocket PC you might ask?  A pocket PC has an operating system just like your computer does and even though it is no where near as powerful as the computer I am typing on it does have the ability to run Pocket PC versions of Microsoft Office applications which means you can put some of your more important Microsoft Word , Excel, powerpoint documents on your Pocket PC and view them.  You can also read Microsoft Reader Ebooks, view jpg images etc.  There is a ton of stuff you can do with the device such as synchronize your MS Outlook contacts and email.  My friend Patty uses a Sony Clie PDA which enables here to carry PDR type information on it for quick reference at the hospital.     Bowling.  Gosh, I did not do that well last night.  I bowled a 130 average over all which means I did ok since my over all league average is 130.  Maggie came out with an attitude last night after several weeks of doing badly and bowled an average of around a 155.  We wound up  losing  3 and winning one which was not too cool since we recently wound up in 3rd place out of 22 teams.  We were 8 games out of 1st place so we have a LOT of work to do to catch up to them.  The league does not end until April so we have plenty of time to catch up.  I am sure after last nights performance we probably dropped a spot or two.

      I am glad that my sweet wife helped me to see the error of my ways when she wrote me an email and told me Mr. Rogers died last year and Captain Kangaroo is the gentleman who died and was 76 years old just this week.  OOOPSSS.  I feel like a baby boomer for sure......  Thanks honey for the quick save with my writing.  Writing is always 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  Luckily for me I have a couple of folks who have a sharp eye and a keen sense of dates and who is who that can keep my brain on the right track.

       Day 20- Relationships are always worth restoring  Verse to remember-Do everything possible on your part to live in peace with everybody.  Romans 12:18  Question to consider- Who do I need to restore a broken relationship with today?    Regarding the true definition of a broken relationship I can think of several.    Mother- unable to reconcile, tried several years and failed Sister- lifestyle justification issues Jeremy - time Creditors - need to pay off debt      My father died in 1990 of cancer.  Shortly before his death I attempted to make some type of amends with our shattered relationship.  I wont go into all the gory details but I will say that we were never close to one another.  As for my mother I spent between 2 to 3 years trying to reconcile our relationship.  My mother and father adopted my sister and I.  Both parents were strict disciplinarians and my sister and I both rebelled.  As young adults our parents chose to disown us.  We did not meet their standards of perfection.  I spent a lot of time in the late 90's trying to reconcile my relationship with my mother.  All my mother was willing to do was to regurgitate every single mistake that I have ever made and reinforce in her mind why I was not worthy of her time nor was she interested in knowing her grandchildren.    My sister Tanya who is 2 years older than me has her fair share of broken relationships, emotional baggage and problems.  My sister moved to Canton Ohio many years ago and because of that we have not been very close.  My sister revealed to me that she has been engaged in a homosexual lifestyle and expected me to affirm her and encourage her choices.  Because I did not do that our relationship was strained to the point that we did not talk for several years.  In the last couple of years I have managed to make a trip to Canton Ohio and spend some time with my sister trying to encourage her to make some tough decisions.      My son Jeremy who lives near Houston Texas will be 18 years old this year.  We are not as close as I would like to be and part of that reason is because I have failed to stay close to him.  In August of 1997 my family and I  moved from Houston Texas to Atlanta Georgia.  My moving made any type of close relationship almost impossible for us to maintain.  Before our move our relationship was not the closest in the world but it was easier and more convenient for Jeremy and I to spend time together when I lived in the same city as him.  I have been told that my moving away and taking contract jobs that kept me away from him reflected my lack of concern for his feelings.  So, I guess that I have done some damage.  I hope that it is not permanent and when Jeremy becomes an adult that he will be able to choose to reach out to me more than he has in the last 17 years.      My creditors would love for me to reconcile my relationships with them.  We owe, we owe, off to work we go.  How many of us sing that song because we are up to our eyeballs in debt.  I am not stranger to debt and thanks to bankruptcy and a divorce my credit has been screwed up for years.  I have also made some bad decisions after the bankruptcy that has not helped me either with regards to credit.      Chapter 21- It is my responsibility to protect the unity of the church  Verse to remember - Let us concentrate on the things which make for harmony and the growth of our fellowship together.  Romans 14:19  Question to consider- what am I personally doing to protect unity in my church family right now?     I am remaining faithful and committed to the church body and the ministry that goes on within the body of Christ there.  On page 161 we are instructed to  "focus on what we have in common, not our differences".  "We should value and enjoy those differences, not merely tolerate them."  On page 162 we see the following principle.  "Be realistic in your expectations".  "once you discover what God intends real fellowship to be it is easy to become discouraged by the gap between the IDEAL and the REAL in your church".  "Yet we must passionately love the church in spite of its imperfections."    Having read this chapter I am reminded of two things.  If I ever want the "ideal" fellowship to happen I will need to exemplify what "real" fellowship is through my actions.  The second thing I have learned is that I need to constantly remind myself that everyone is on a unique path of their own and for me to expect them to understand and grasp the things I do is unrealistic.  I wonder how many of my brothers or sisters in the Lord think the same thing of me?  Gosh, why doesn't James get it??  Instead of focusing on the future of "real" fellowship at Grace Fellowship  I need to find a way to focus on those things that we as a body of Christ DO have in common now and build on that.  The following commands are excellent suggestions to protect unity in our church.  " Choose to encourage rather than criticize".  "Refuse to listen to gossip".  "Practice Gods method for conflict resolution"  "Support your pastor and leaders".      Chapter 22 - I was created to become like Christ  Verse to remember - As the spirit of the Lord works within us , we become more and more like him and reflect his glory even more.  2 Corinthians 3:18b  Question to consider - In what area of my life do I need to ask for the spirits power to be like Christ today?    The following statements are important to me in this chapter.    "every time you forget that character is one of Gods purposes for your ulife, you will become frustrated by your circumstances"     "life is supposed to be difficult !  It is what enables us to grow"    I need to learn how to welcome and embrace difficult circumstances in my life. I am like most people in that I do not cherish conflicts but would rather life to be hassle free and smooth sailing.  I want my needs met but I also desire to have those things that I see others have.  Lately I have found myself envious of people who appear to have extremely stable lives.  That is my perception from where I am standing.  Those people are those who have been able to keep a job for longer than 2 years, have a home they are purchasing, drive new cars etc.  I realize that jealousy and envy is sin and I also acknowledge that some folks have made wise choices in their life that enables them to have certain things and enjoy certain activities and social status.  I am reminded today that perhaps I do not see what goes on behind the perception I have with regards to stability in the lives of others. Maybe those people struggle in other areas of their lives that I can not see.  Maybe their struggles in the areas of life that they are in are those character building blocks that Christ is using to bring them into likeness with him.    I need to take my eyes off of other people and their circumstances and outward appearances and stop comparing my life with theirs.  I need to focus on my own life struggles and learn those lessons and character building that I can receive as I am going through them.  I need to quit asking "Why me Lord" and "why cant I have a break just for a little bit" and "why do I have to go through long periods of intense battle and struggle".  I need to learn to be thankful for God placing his grace and mercy on my life and caring enough about me to lead me through the trials and tribulations of daily sanctification.   I am reminded of Christ praying in the garden knowing what was ahead of him.  He asked God to remove the cup from him if at all possible but nevertheless that His will be done on earth and not his own.  As I whine and moan and complain that life is so tough I am sinning against God.  I need the Holy Spirit to give me the strength to perceive life as a character building and as a challenge to be obedient and make the right choices.    I also need assistance in the area of being servant. I need to learn how to seek out the needs of others and do whatever I am able to do to minister to them.  I need to be more selfless and self seeking.

        I received this article from Rick Schatz because I am subscribed to his newsletter. I agree with everything that is said in this article and want to use my BLOG as a place to SHOUT IT FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOP......  I have always said that we live in a REAL world with REAL PROBLEMS and we have a REAL SOLUTION and that solution is Jesus Christ living within me.  I have always said that if the CHRISTIAN community would stand up and RAISE their voices and say that ENOUGH is ENOUGH that the secular world would HAVE to listen.  That does not always mean that the world is going to change its wicked ways. What it DOES mean is that our voices will be heard and the world will have yet ANOTHER opportunity to choose righteousness over wickedness.  How will the world KNOW that what they are doing offends God IF we as Christians sit back quietly and say nothing.  Apathy and cowardice in the face of the majority will NEVER change one single thing in this world.  I have also said that the church as a whole is apathetic and complacent because the church is not willing to DO WHAT IT TAKES to make a difference.  Sometimes making a difference means to sacrifice something. Those things can include time, talents, money, power, prestige, popularity and our own private security zones we like to stay warm in.    I am thankful for organizations like this one that are willing to do what it takes to be heard.  I stand behind what they are doing.    God bless        From: Rick Schatz, President and CEO Date: 02/03/04 11:54:23 To: james@jesus-connect.net Subject: MTV THUMBS ITS NOSE AT PARENTS       WELCOME!  IN THE NEWS  MTV THUMBS ITS NOSE AT PARENTS DURING HALFTIME SHOW  MTV's halftime show was a slap in the face to parents and youngsters across the country, said the National Coalition for the Protection of Children & Families.  "The last thing a parent expects to see when they sit down with their family to watch the Super Bowl is Janet Jackson's breast," said Rick Schatz, president and CEO of the National Coalition.  "The Super Bowl provides a unique opportunity in that it can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. To feature a halftime show that requires parents to send their kids out of the room is unconscionable."  The Super Bowl started out with a beautiful tribute to NASA and the space shuttle astronauts who lost their lives a year ago but it went rapidly downhill with the halftime show.  Parents who gathered to watch the show with their kids were blindsided not only by the baring of Jackson's breast but also by the freak dancing, crotch grabbing and sexualized lyrics of the music.  "CBS clearly made a very poor choice in having MTV design and produce the content of the halftime show," Schatz noted. "The MTV ideology is clearly aimed at promoting a sexualized lifestyle to teens. This time they got the chance to do it on broadcast television instead of cable."  Even the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission called the incident a "classless, crass and deplorable stunt." The commission has already agreed to launch an investigation.  The National Coalition will be polling its constituents to get their feedback on the halftime show. In addition, the organization will be focusing on informing parents about what they really get when they pay for MTV in their cable package.  Please let us know if you watched the halftime show and what you thought of it. Please send us your comments at ncpcf@nationalcoalition.org.    KUDOS TO ABERCROMBIE & FITCH FOR CLEANING UP ITS ACT  The National Coalition for the Protection of Children & Families has officially called off its boycott of clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch.  "We've seen some stunning developments at A&F," said Rick Schatz, president and CEO of the National Coalition. "Not only did they retire the 'magalog' in December but also they have unveiled their spring clothing line without resorting to the offensive, sexualized messages of the past."  Schatz has been in conversations with A&F's Director of Investor Relations and Communications, who assured him that the clothing company had dramatically changed its marketing methods.  "We've seen evidence on A&F's web site and in their stores that things have indeed changed," noted Schatz. "The people spoke, the company listened, and it has done the right thing."  The National Coalition launched its awareness campaign against A&F on Nov. 10. By December 6, the company had retired its "magalog," which was filled with nudity and text that promoted risky sexual behavior.  More than 30,000 people signed the National Coalition's online petition or called to express their outrage. A&F's in-store sales dropped as did their stock, and they received an abundance of negative press.  Schatz added that A&F's decision to change the way it markets clothing to teens and young adults underscores the fact that when thousands of concerned consumers speak with one voice, they can change the culture.

MICHAEL CRAVEN DEBATES ACLU AT UC BERKELEY  Michael Craven, the National Coalition's vice president for religious and cultural affairs, debated representatives from the ACLU on the subjects of homosexuality and same-sex marriage Jan. 28.  Before a visibly hostile crowd of 600-plus students at the University of California, Berkeley, Craven presented the sociological and historical perspectives regarding not just homosexuality but other matters of moral truth related to sexuality.  "What I saw was a generation of young people who are desperately interested in knowing the truth," Craven said. "And I realized that what was important was not simply to win the debate but to demonstrate the light and love of Christ."  Despite the unbalanced nature of the debate, Craven's attempts to present reasonable and rational arguments for marriage between one man and one woman didn't go unheard. He was approached by more than 30 students at the close of the debate, all of whom disagreed with his position but were moved by the calm and compassionate way in which he spoke.  "I realized how important it is that we focus on people, not just the issue," he said. "When we reflect Christ's own grief and compassion for those who don't understand truth, then we can impact their hearts."

           Gal 6:9  Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.  Gal 6:10  Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.           Katy called me the other day when I was at work.  Honey, who do we know that lives in Columbus Ohio?  I told her that my sister Tanya lives somewhere in Canton Ohio but other than that I did not know IF I actually know of someone.  Katy tells me that this person sent us CASH in an envelope with Galatians 6:10 printed on it with no name, no return address , no nothing...    As you know, I was out of work for most of 2003.  We managed to scrape by on what unemployment paid me which was 7.50 per hour.  Yes, our needs were met and for that we are deeply grateful.  There were days when we wondered WHEN the needs would be met and things got sort of ugly.  Nevertheless we never were homeless, always had something to eat and the "needs" were met....  The amount of money that was in the envelope was enough money to move our checking account out of the  RED  and back into the  BLACK ....  Praise God for that...  Thank you Jesus!!!

"I had my big kick and I don't need to do it again," he said. "I regret it all very much, but I can't undo it."   ONLY 8.5 years for killing and EATING his victim. Can we really believe that anyone in their right mind would WANT to be stabbed to death and eaten by a stranger????    Come soon Lord Jesus, come soon!!!!

       Chapter 30- I was shaped for serving God    Verse to remember -  God works through different men in different ways, but is the same God who achieves his purpose through them all.  1 Cor 12:6  Question to consider-  In what way can I see myself passionately serving others and loving it?   How God shapes me for ministry:  Spiritual gifts Heart Abilities Personality Experience  Your spiritual gifts were not given for your own benefit but for the benefit of others  I love people and I thrive on interacting with them in a real way.  I am not a social butterfly and I do not care about small talk or superficial chit chat.  I love to talk about matters of the heart.  I am compelled to know people for who they are. I like to find ways to connect to others so I can share my faith.  I love to tell people about who Jesus is to me.  I would love to help lead new Christians into a deeper understanding of discipleship and how to walk the walk.  I love to preach and teach Gods word and encourage others.      Chapter 31-  Nobody can be like me    Verse to remember-  God has given each of you some special abilities, be sure to use them to help each other, passing on to others Gods many kinds of blessings  1 Peter 4:10    Question to consider-  What God given ability  or personal experience can I offer to my church?   According to the book I have been shaped by the following experiences  Family  Educational Vocational Spiritual Ministry Painful  I love to encourage people.  I am an extrovert and I thrive on human contact.  I love to communicate with people both in person as well as through the written word. I like to write short stories and articles about those things that are near and dear to my heart.  I feel compelled to be transparent in my writing as I share the events of my life with others.  I want people to know who Jesus is and how he is changing me from the inside.  I want to teach others what I have learned through experiences and reading Gods word.  I have a natural  attraction towards computer technology and electronics.  I love photography and capturing moments on film.      Chapter 32-  God deserves my best  Verse to remember-  do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth  2 Tim 2:15  Question to consider-  How can I make the best use of what God has given me?   I need to prioritize  my time more efficiently  and find opportunities of service.  I need to learn how to take what I already know and walk ti out in my life in practical ways.  I need to ask God to open up doors of opportunity where I can use my spiritual gifts , abilities and experiences to minister to the needs of others.  I need to stop comparing my life and ministry to other people and run the race that God has enabled me to run.    Chapter 33-  I serve God by serving others  Verse to remember-  If you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers; you shall surely be rewarded  Matt 10:42  Question to consider -  which of the 6 characteristics of real servants offers the greatest challenge to me?    We serve God by serving others  God shaped you for service, not for self centeredness  You can tell what they are by what they do   The six characteristics of a servant are  Available to serve Pay attention to needs Do the best with what you have Do every task with equal dedication Faithful to ministry Maintain a low profile   Being available to serve is probably the number one problem out of all 6 characteristics.  If I were honest with myself I would admit that there are times that I struggle with each of these characteristics.    I live in a materialistic world that determines my value and identity by what I own and what I am able to do.  You are someone if you live there, drive that and belong to this organization and have this amount of wealth.  We are constantly bombarded by marketing of all types that tells us that we need all sorts of junk.  Our wants have destroyed our perception of real needs and therefore we spend most of our time pursuing things, wealth and status.  I can not serve God as much as I should because of bad financial decisions, debt, poor time management and the pursuit to be entertained during what little free time I do have.    On page 259 of this book there is a quote by John Wesley and  it says the following  Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as you can  John Wesley  OUCH and double OUCH  That hurts  That means that I should pursue opportunities to do good and serve others every opportunity I get.  Serving others will never be convenient or fun until God changes our hearts and gives us the desire to serve others above our own needs and happiness.  Instead of looking for one opportunity per day to be good to someone I should never stop looking to serve others.    Chapter 34-  To be a servant I must think like a servant  Verse to remember-  your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus  Phillipians 2:5  Question to consider -  Am I usually more concerned about being served or finding ways to serve others?   If a need crosses my path that I can meet I usually do what I can.  Do I go out of my way or inconvenience myself to see or find needs?  The answer to that is no.  I need to be more sensitive to others needs and be more willing to make myself available to meet some of those needs.    Service starts in your mind  servants think more about others than about themselves  servants think like stewards, not owners  servants think about their work, not what others are doing  servants base their identity in Christ  servants think of ministry as opportunity , not an obligation    Chapter 35-  God works best when I admit my weaknesses  Verse to remember-  My grace is sufficient for you, my power is made perfect in weakness  2 Cor 12:9a  Question to consider-  Am I limiting Gods power in my life by trying to hide my weaknesses?  What do I need to be honest about in order to help others?   Yes, I am sure that I sometimes limit Gods power in my life.  I am proud and sometimes arrogant.  At times in my life I have been told this and my defense was that I am not arrogant but self confident.  I am just very confident in my abilities.  When does self confidence turn into pride and arrogance?  Can one be self confident and humble at the same time?  At a very early age I rebelled against my parents authority and excessive abusive behavior towards me .  I went out into the world determined to escape the abuse and do things my way.  Life taught me some very hard lessons and I quickly realized that my parents did posses  a certain amount of worldly wisdom that I if I had followed it some of my lifes lessons might not have been so painful.   Thanks to the school of hard knocks I learned at a very young age to be a survivor.  My support system  most of the time was me, I and myself.  I did not have a close relationship with a parent figure, mentor or friend who could speak truth into my life , give me guidance or allow me to be vulnerable to them.  My nature was and still is to some degree to just handle it  myself.  I want people to think that everything is under control.  I sometimes think that if I were to be vulnerable to people that I would be viewed as a whiner, weakling  or cry baby that needs to just  suck it up.  It is easier for me to communicate my true feelings and struggles in writing than it is for me to be vulnerable to the fellowship of believers I go to church with.   I suppose that because I do not share with others the things that go on in my heart that they assume all is well and therefore they do not need to pursue me in an effort to connect with me.  I am task and results oriented and when the feedback level is low or non existent I become discouraged and find it difficult to pursue moments of connectivity with other people.  I wonder  how many people feel the same way as I do?  Ships passing in the night with no apparent problems or needs..

       Chapter 27- There is always a way out  Verse to remember- God is faithful.  He will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you can not stand up against it.  When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you will not give into it. 1 Cor 10:13  Question to consider- who could I ask to be a spiritual partner to help me defeat a persistent temptation by praying for me?   According to this chapter defeating temptation takes these steps:  Refocus your attention on something else Reveal your struggle to a godly friend or support group Resist the devil Realize your vulnerability  I have several people in my life who I am accountable to and who are willing to pray for any needs in my life.  My wife is the first and foremost accountability partner since she is the closest to me and knows me better than most people.    Chapter 28- There are no shortcuts to maturity  Verse to remember- God began doing a good work in you, and I am sure he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again.  Phillipians 1:6  Question to consider- In what area of my spiritual growth do I need to be more patient and persistent?   I need to be less fearful of loss.  In this chapter it states  There is no growth without change; there is no change without fear or loss; and there is no loss without pain.   This reminds me of one of my favorite sayings.  Through the pain onward to battle and victory.  I need to start a notebook or journal of lessons learned.  I love to write anyway so this should not be difficult for me to start.   I need to be more patient with myself. I am my worst judge.      Chapter 29-  Service is not optional  Verse to remember -  For we are Gods workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.  Question to consider-  What is holding me back from accepting Gods call to serve him?    This chapter tells us the following truths  You were created to serve God You were saved to serve God You were called to serve God You are commanded to serve God  Impression without expression causes depression  The only thing that is hindering me with regards to service is the amount of time I would like spend doing it.  With regards to my local congregation I wish I were in a position to do more than I am able to do.  I wish I had more avenues of ministry.  It seems that the larger the congregation the more opportunities to serve.      James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net

       The Purpose Drive Life - Day 24,25 &26        Chapter 24 -The truth transforms us       Verse to remember - If you continue in my word, then are you disciples indeed, and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  John 8:31-32  Question to consider- what has God already told me in his word that I have not started yet?      The following quotes in this chapter stand out to me.   "The truth transforms us"  "Gods word generates life, creates faith, produces change, frightens the devil, causes miracles, heals hurts, builds character, transforms circumstances, imparts joy, overcomes adversity, defeats temptation, infuses hope, releases power, cleanses our minds,  brings things into being, and guarantees our future forever"  "We cannot live without the word of God"     "Never take the word of God for granted"     Abiding in Gods word includes these activities        I must ACCEPT its authority I must ASSIMILATE its truth I must APPLY its principles      "Memorizing Bible verses helps resist temptation, make wise decisions, reduce stress, build confidence, offer good advice and enables me to share my faith with others."  "The truth will set you free, but first it may make you miserable!  Gods word exposes our motives, points out our faults, rebukes our sin, and expects us to change"  "The bible was not given to increase our knowledge but to change our lives"   To answer the question for this chapter will require brutal honesty.  I have spent most of my time after spiritual rebirth gaining knowledge about God and his word.  I have spent countless hours on intense bible study and preparation to teach what I have learned about Gods word to others.  However I have not applied everything   learned in practical ways to my life.     I guess that if I were honest I would have to say that I have practiced "sporadic obedience."  Perhaps I could further define it as periods of being on a spiritual rollercoaster.  On page 187 it says "many of our troubles occur because we base our choices on unreliable authorities:  culture, tradition, reason and emotion."  Our sin nature automatically engages all of these authorities if we are not careful. I have fallen victim to all four of these at different times in my life.  Here are some action items I need to take.  I will read Gods word every day and not when I feel like it or when it is convenient  I will practice better self control with regards to being a good steward with my finances.    I will actively pursue opportunities to serve my immediate family, my church body and the community God placed me in.   I will purpose in my heart to find the good in people I meet and leave their problems and faults with God.   I will purpose to connect with other men in my community for the purpose of developing relationships so that we can grow in grace and spiritual maturity together.   I will purpose in my heart to renew my mind and heart through Gods word instead of trying to find multiple ways to be entertained and just burn empty time.    Chapter 25- There is a purpose behind every problem  Verse to remember- And we know that in all things God works for the good of those that love him, who have been called according to his purpose.  Romans 8:28  Question to consider- What problem in my life has caused the greatest growth in me?      The following quotes in this chapter stood out for me.   "If you look at the world, you will be distressed. If you look at within, you will be depressed.  But if you look at Christ, you will be at rest!  Your focus will determine your feelings"  "Character building is a slow process"     I have had 3 major events in my life that have caused the most spiritual growth.     Event one happened when I was just 3 or 4 months old in Christ. I was a fire insurance Christian and I only called upon God when I was in trouble. I called Jesus savior but he was not the Lord of all. I lived life with me being in the center of the throne room of my heart and not God.  I spent 45 days in a street rescue mission called The Star of Hope Mission where God got my undivided attention.     Event TWO happened when I experienced a divorce from my first wife and separation from the family I loved.  I was devastated, angry, bitter and resentful towards my ex wife, her family and God.  One of the things that I learned was that it takes 2 people to experience divorce and I had to recognize my participation in both conscious and unconscious sin that helped to destroy the relationship.  I also experienced the pain and anxiety of separation from the two people that I loved with every fiber of my being.  I learned during this time that God is always there and is able to comfort, strengthen and heal when no one else is.     Event 3 is when we lost our daughter Jessica to cancer.  The most difficult part of this loss was to realize that Jessica was not ours.  Jessica is Gods child.  God allows us to experience the lives of children and to manage their day to day details. We are able to enjoy the many joys and trails that they face.  We are reminded of our parent child relationship with God as we attempt to be Godly parents to our children.  Our humanity is reflected back to us from our children as constant reminders of our need for humility and a real connection with our creator.     Chapter 26- Every temptation is an opportunity to do good.  Verse to remember- God blesses the people who patiently endure testing. Afterwards they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him James 1:12  Question to consider - What Christ like character quality can I develop by defeating the most common temptation I face?    The following quotes stood out for me in this chapter.   "God develops real peace within us, not by making things go the way we planned, but by allowing times of chaos and confusion"  "We learn real peace by choosing to trust God in circumstances in which we are tempted to worry or be afraid."  "We learn real peace by choosing to trust God in circumstances in which we are tempted to worry or be afraid"   I keep coming back to the theme with regards to my response to tests in my life. I always want for life to be smooth sailing.  Why me Lord and what have I done to deserve this situation or these circumstances are questions I always seem to ask. I believe that ultimately I tend to do what is right with regards to being faithful and enduring hardship.  My problem is I start out acting surprised at the circumstances of a situation and spend my initial moments mentally reacting to it as if the situation is not fair.  Nothing in life is fair.  We live in a fallen world and bad things happen to good people just as good things happen to bad people.   Sometimes I react wrong emotionally to circumstances and make poor choices. I can truly say that I am learning what it means to have peace and joy in the midst of trials in my life.

        Who started listening to ground hogs with regards to predicting our weather anyway?  The ground hog saw his shadow the other day and I guess that means 6 more weeks of winter weather.  Did anyone think about relocating the ground hog to another part of the globe where the sun would be directly on top of his little noggin and therefore would be NO shadow?  Sheesh...  Yes, I did think about taking OUT the ground hog but resisted any excessive excitement about that option just in case our friends from PETA were reading my drivel....  LOL.  Like they would be reading MY blog.... NOT....   This weekend downtown Charleston was in full swing with visitors from who knows where.  I have not seen that many umbrellas this side of Niagra Falls.  I am wondering IF these people who visited our fine city decided to visit BECAUSE of the 2 day rain storms or IF they were locked into the visit because of having planned their weekend jaunt to our fine city months ago?  Either way, I hope that they re think their planning strategies for next year and NOT visit us in the midst of the winter months.  Dont get me wrong, Charleston certainly has its fair share of tourist trap goodies to visit and remove your disposable income from your possesion.  I am hoping that because they are able to do this so effectively (like most tourist traps) that someone in city hall will think about fixing some of the pot holes and streets in our fine city.  GASP....  Imagine that thought...  Luckily for me I was able to observe the happenings all around me at work from the vantage point of my favorite parking garage.  Cough....  It is amazing to me how many people look at things from a horizontal view point.  It seems as if no one ever looks up past the second story of any dwelling.  Well, at least they don't until the passing pigeon deposits a prize on their noggins.  If that happens DO NOT look up because the pigeons fly in numbers and if they are all on the same schedule you may get more than you bargained for.    It is Presidents Day and most Government Employees are enjoying a day AWAY from their cubicle prisons.  Wahoooo!  What a deal.  If you are lucky you are getting paid for being off today as well.  This is my regular day off so I am off regardless of what President we are honoring or what ground hogs see when they look at the ground.  The kids just got back from the Dentist in Mt Pleasant and got their teeth cleaned.  I guess I will need sun glasses now to see their beautiful smiles.  I am on Day 29 of my 40 days of purpose (porpoise) devotional study by Rick Warren.    The Purpose Driven Life and The Purpose Driven Church are two indespensible books for your library so if you don't have them rush right over to your nearest Christian Bookstore URL and get them.  Experiencing God Day by Day is another book that has the same theme.  Both authors , Blackaby and Warren have Southern Baptist Convention backgrounds if you are interested in that type of trivia.   I have encouraged several friends to get this book and engage in working through the 40 days.  One friend told me that she has had the book in her posession but has not chosen to do anything other than collect dust with it.  Another friend is just starting the book and is beginning to work through the contents.  Did I say that this book is not intended to make your comfortable or help you to stay wrapped up in your current security blanket?  This book is not light reading either.  You will either love this book or you will hate it.  The book will challenge you to examine your views about a lot of different things with regards to your faith.   Are you ready for that?  Are you ready for change?  Change means sacrifice and loss and therefore sometimes pain.  Do you have some extra Excedrin in the medicine closet?  If you do, it wont help.  The Holy Spirit will be the only one that can administer healing with regards to the change and pain I am talking about.  I wish you Jesus should you undertake this study.  Get a pen, journal notepad and a nice cup of coffee and get started.

       Verse to remember-  be ready at all times to answer anyone who asks you to explain the hope you have in you, but do with gentleness and respect.  1 Peter 3:15-16  Question  as I reflect on my personal story, who does God want me to share it with?   God has given me a life message to Share  This message has four parts  Testimony Life lessons Godly passions Good news  Our testimony should contain four parts  What my life was like before I met Jesus How I realized I needed Jesus How I committed my life to Jesus The difference Jesus has made in my life  Life lessons are lessons and insights you have learned about God, relationships, problems, temptations, and other aspects of life.  Here are some questions I should answer.   What has God taught me from failure? What has God taught me from lack of money? What has God taught me from pain, sorrow or depression? What has God taught me from disappointment? What have I learned from my family, my church, my relationships, my small groups and my critics?   A mans heart determines his speech  Your life message includes the good news.  The good news is that when we trust Gods grace to save us through what Jesus did, our sins are forgiven, we get a purpose for living, and we are promised  a future home in heaven.  I must learn to love lost people the way God does       God made me to be  A member of His family A model of his character A magnifier of His glory A minister of His grace A messenger of His Good News to others  That is why spreading the good news is so important; you only have a short time to share your life message and fulfill your mission.  WOW and DOUBLE WOW!!!  To answer the question for this chapter God wants me to share my life story with everyone.  I should share my personal story with both believers and non believers. Different people will relate to the different life stories and lessons and hopefully Christ will be glorified and others will experience a measure of HOPE and healing as they see Christ in the midst  of my life experiences.  I am motivated to buy some gospel tracts and copies of this book to pass on to everyone in my life.    James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net

       Chapter 36-  I was made for a mission    Verse to remember-  Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.  Matt 28:19,20    Question to consider-  what fears have kept me from fulfilling the mission God gave me to accomplish?  What keeps me from telling others the good news?   Give the right opportunity and timing I have no fears about sharing with others who Jesus is to me. On page 286 the book states to fulfill your mission will require that you abandon your agenda and accept Gods agenda for your life  So that brings me to this question.  What is my agenda?  I sometimes think that my agenda is to survive life from one day to the next.  How much time is consumed by pursuing a paycheck so I can pay the never ending flow of bills.  Bills are like washing clothes.  Once you start the cycle you never seem to stop.  You start out in this process by controlling the process but after awhile  the process can take on a life of its own and begin to control you.  I owe I owe off to work I go is my motto every time I head out the door to work.  The pursuit of money so I can keep my head above water is a large portion of my agenda. The bible states that if my faith is the size of a mustard seed that I can move mountains.  How much faith do I have for God to meet my needs when I spend most of my waking hours working for a paycheck.  Instead of being a kingdom builder I am doing everything I can to maintain a certain level of existence.  Poor financial decisions and unfortunate circumstances has me in this place.  To be a good steward I must work so that through me with Gods provision I can provide for my family.    The second question that comes to mind is this.  I have people in my neighborhood on my street that I do not know.  Am I lazy?  Perhaps I am just too wrapped up in my agenda.  I need to figure out how to simplify the tasks in my life and free up more time to fulfill Gods agenda.  What is God blessing in the community I live in?  How will I ever know if I dont take the time to look around and ask God to show me?  The other thing that might keep me from sharing the good news is my natural desire to hide the things in my life that would affect the integrity of the gospel.  It is one thing to be an effective speaker or be able to present the facts.  It is another thing to be able to speak Gods word with integrity and power and confidence.  Paul could say  Do as I do with regards to being the example of a Godly man.  I know that there are moments in my life that reflect my humanity and sinful nature.  When those things come into the light it damages my testimony of who Jesus is to me.  How can I share the good news to a non believer when I have moments when I am a bad ambassador for Christ?  I know that in my weakness HE is strong.  What about the times that I chose to willfully sin and deny the power of God in my life?  How much integrity will my testimony be then?

       Chapter 40 - Living with purpose is really the only way to live  Verse - For David. Served the purpose of God in his own generation. Acts 13:36  Question - When will I take the time to write down my answers to life's five great questions? When will I put my purpose on paper?  What is a Life Purpose Statement?   A statement that:   points the direction of your life defines success for you clarifies your roles expresses your shape     Life's Five greatest questions:   What will be the center of my life?   The center of my life will be for me and my house to serve the Lord.  To be doers of the word and not mere spectators in the game of life.  In order to keep the Lord at the center of our lives I have to keep myself from being distracted  by the things of this world.  The things of this world bring temporary pleasure and happiness but no lasting peace or purpose.    What will be the character of my life?   The following is my perception of the character attributes in my life as I understand myself.    Love -  to truly love others we must be willing to serve them above ourselves.  While we were yet sinners Christ died for us.  In the same way we should show love one to another through service.  I sometimes love myself more than others because I can be selfish.    Joy -  (cheerfulness, calm delight, gladness)- I struggle with joy during times of trouble.  I am not always glad about trials or tribulation.  I sometimes worry about things that I have no control over.   Peace-  (quietness, rest) - Externally I appear to have it together or under control. Sometimes I struggle with the unfairness of my circumstances which causes me to have inner turmoil.  Ultimately I find peace when I release it to God.   Patience-  (forbearance or  fortitude, longsuffering)-  I have been learning patience the hard way.  My nature is to be spontaneous and make gut feeling decisions on the fly.  Through the consequences of these decisions I have made some mistakes and through those mistakes I am learning patience.  Kindness-  this is not my strongest character attribute.  I struggle with compassion and mercy and kindness  Goodness-  (virtue or beneficence, benign, soft winning, tender either  in temper or behavior)  this one does not come easy to me either. It is easier for me to be critical and harsh than to be soft or tender.  Maybe this is reflected in the struggles I have with having a relationship with my children.   Faithfulness-  (credence, moral conviction, reliance upon  Christ for salvation) on many occasions I have thought that being a Christian was more difficult than I could handle.  I have wanted to take the road of least resistance.  God has given me the grace to be an over comer.    Gentleness- (usefulness, moral excellence in character or demeanor, good or kind)  I am as gentle as an 800 lb gorilla by nature.  I have to work at this attribute.    Self Control -  (temperance, not only abstinence from harmful drinks or food but control of the temper, the tongue, the desires, the passions for money or power) Through Gods grace I am able to engage this most of the time.      What will be the contribution of my life?   I have been blessed to have been allowed to do the following in service for the kingdom.   Street ministry Children church pastor Evangelism Team Royal Ambassador leader Mens Fellowship Director Sunday School teacher Lay Minister preacher Audio/video/sound  Internet Ministry Freelance writing - Christ and family oriented    What will be the communication of my life?   Street ministry Peaceful demonstrator at Abortion clinic Working with homeless people Preaching and teaching God's word    What will be the community of my life?   I find myself being the one to pursue others and engage them in relationships that are beyond superficial day to day chit chat.  I have been accused of getting too close to people to quickly.  I am supposedly too up front and personal in my approach with others.  How else can I get to know people other than to discover who they are beyond the surface?  I believe that my life should be transparent and an open book so that Christ in me can be glorified.  That also means letting people see the good and the ugly.  That means that I need to be open, honest and vulnerable.  Most people do not return that level of fellowship.  Most people do not trust others where they are willing to be vulnerable.      The following statements will be a part of my life purpose statement.     To serve God with all my mind heart and soul To love my neighbor as myself To allow the Lord to be MY LORD  To study Gods word and be a workman that needs not be ashamed and allow His word to change me from the inside out To be an exemplary husband to Katy To be a father who does not invoke wrath in my children To be a father to my son and daughter who lives Jesus in front of them so that they can learn the character of God To bring up my children in the knowledge and admonition of the Lord Jesus Christ To serve the community God has placed me in and point them to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ To define and exercise my SHAPE for ministry every day      My life purpose is to glorify Jesus Christ  in my thoughts, actions and motivations.  I will be successful in God's eyes when I place my life in his hands and allow him to mold me and shape me into his image.  My role is  to serve God , church and family before myself.  My goal is to exercise the spiritual gifts and talents God has given me both in personal ministry and my mission to the world.

       I am on day 40 of the  urlLink Order this book now and invest 40 days of your life 40 days of purpose devotional by Rick Warren   I can not tell you how blessed I am by having invested these last 40 days in this devotional study.  I actually took a bit longer than 40 days to do this study.  That is ok though, I believe that my doing it the way I did it did not take away from the message in the book.  Now that I am finished I have some homework to do.  There are some questions and/or drills in the book that I need to go investigate and spend time meditating and writing these things down.  I am telling all of my friends and associates that I have contact with to get THE BOOK.  Atleast one of my friends that I know DID actually get the book and is working through it.  Praise God for that.  I am so excited about it too.  I am so convinced that this book is going to bless others that I am going to try and buy atleast one book per pay day to give away to someone that might need it or want it and can not afford it. Before I go any further with my thoughts below I want to say that I believe that this book is written to an audience of people that already know who Christ is and have embraced GRACE and are walking the walk of faith seeking Jesus Christ as Lord.  That does not mean that a non believer could not SEE the character of God portrayed in this book.  The book does not examine the consequences of NOT accepting Grace nor does it highlight the fact that we as believers were once sinners and that we are required to REPENT of our sins (change our minds and turn away from our old sin nature and life style) as an integral part of our salvation.     Where do I go with this now that I am done?  I have been compelled to change things in my life.  The question is WILL I CHANGE those things in my life that need to be changed?  I will say that this book has certainly broadened my thinking with regards to my "views" on church tradition.  There are biblical facts that we know because we have read, studied and meditated upon Gods word.  Then there are traditional views that we hold because we were taught those things over the years without having investigated their validity for ourselves. These ideals or precepts have been engrained in us because of years of church practice and tradition.  For instance the thought that we listen to Christian music at church and call it Worship music.  The only way that we can tell that worship music is worship music is because of lyrics that give God praise , honor and glory.  Without the words the music would be MUSIC.  Another thing I learned is the difference between worship and ministry.  I used to think that ministry equated to teaching bible studies , preaching or reaching out to the community.  This book tells me that anything that I do that involves any type of spiritual fruit, spiritual gifts or natural talents for the betterment of the church and its people is ministry.  Ministry is doing acts of service to the body of Christ.  When I do those acts of service no matter what they are I am worshipping God through my deeds.  This book has helped me to define and re discover my SHAPE for ministry.    Ok, that is all you are going to get from me on the "content" of this book for now. Now to switch gears for a bit with posing a question to meditate upon.  How many bible studies, sermons or seminars do we need to attend to become more like Christ?  Has our religion become the pursuit of knowledge or is it our acting out that which we already know to be truth?  Is our religion and relationship with Christ emotionally driven where we must feel good in order to validate our faith and be obedient?  We are ambassadors for Christ sent out into the world to preach the good news to the lost , sick and dying of this world.  Jesus did not come into this world to save the religious people.  Jesus came to this world to save the sick and dying people.  Jesus knew that without him and his gift and ministry that we were doomed for eternal separation from God.  Jesus Christ had a MISSION to fulfill and he fulfilled it when he died on the cross for the sins of mankind , past present and future.  The bible clearly states that Gods mission should now be our mission.  Instead of pursuing material wealth and being wealth builders we should be busy at being KINGDOM builders.  I have been compelled to examine my purpose for living.  It is NOT about me but it IS about God.  It is not about the messenger it is about the MESSAGE.  Jesus Christ crucified and resurrected to give us life.  My purpose is not to just figure out HOW to pay the bills and live from one day at a time.  Life is more than mere survival.  God came that we might have ABUNDANT life and the only way we can have ABUNDANT LIFE is to fulfill Gods purposes in our lives.    I have to say that all of this is some what overwhelming to me. I look back at what I have read and am learning with regards to this book and I have to say that you should probably study and meditate on the book and its 1200 scripture references over a much longer time period than 40 days.  I know people who are on their third reading and are still getting new nuggets of truth from it.  Am I implying above that we should abandon our responsibilities of going to work and paying bills or take away quality time from our family responsibilities.  No, I am certainly not saying that.  One of the things that this book talks about at the very end is about prioritizing our lives in such a way that we remove the JUNK from our lives.  Junk that has not eternal value and only momentary value for TODAY.  We live in a feel good society and the world says if it FEELS good do it.  As Christians we no longer do what FEELS good because we have been taught that our hearts are deceitfully wicked and that there are consequences for acting out to make our flesh happy when it wants to FEEL good.  I am like you in that I have TIME that could be better prioritized and spent in ministry and worship.  That means that I will need to change some habits and my thinking ABOUT those things.    You can follow my 40 Day journey as I discovered Gods Purpose for my life by reading my blog here.  I published my devotional notes so that I could share what I am learning and now going to attempt to DO in my life.  Please pray for me as I meditate and PURPOSE in my heart to CHANGE.  Through the pain, onward to battle and victory!!!  God bless

        I started to title this blog "Wet T Shirt Contest" but I did not want the server that this is sitting on to be overwhelmed to the point that my blog would no longer be available.  Not only that but I was the only entry to the contest and quite naturally I did win.  LOL....    Yes, I got wet but not for the sake of having a wet t shirt contest. I had a date witht he power washer thanks to yesterday being much warmer than the last time I did it.  I almost froze off part of my rear end that day.  It is amazing what one will do to fight off depression I guess....  Well, the OTHER side of the double wide is now clean.  One side of my neighbors trailer is white again and not algae green.  Wahooooo!  I spent atleast 2 hours washing the deck between my place and "the other trailer".  Did I tell you how horribly filthy it is?  Every time it rains I kept slipping on something slick.  That something is years and years of grime and dirt.  I can actually see the original wood color now.  I still need to figure out what chemical I will need to use to break the dirt up to make it EASIER to get it clean.  You would think that the power washer would just knock it right off but alas it does not.  I tried something my friend next door gave me and it just sat on top of the grime and did nothing other than make it wetter.  I finally broke out the Clorox Bleach and that seemed to help a little bit.   Last night I out did myself on the bowling alley.  Our team name is Four Play....  Alrighty then...  How did we come up with that team name??  I will plead the fifth on that one folks...  I bowled a 165 average last night.  Wahooooo  My 180 game is the highest game yet for me at this bowling alley.  Last week I bowled a whopping 121 average which is 7 pins BELOW my 128 average.  Our team is in 10th place BEFORE last night but since we took three out of four games we should move up a notch or two.

        Chapter 38- The Great Commission is my commission     Verse to remember- Send us around the world with the news of your saving power and your eternal plan for all mankind. Psalm 67:2    Question to consider - what steps can I take to prepare to go on a short term missions experience in the next year?   In reality that happening in the next year is slim to none. Once Katy and I have full time jobs with vacation time after one year of service then we could think about this.    Chapter 39- Blessed to be balanced    Verse to remember- life life with a due sense of responsibility, not as those that do not know the meaning of life but as those who do. Eph 5:15    Question to consider- Which of the 4 activities will I begin in order to stay on track and balance Gods five purposes in my life?    The 5 purposes were:   	 Practiced by the first Christians in Acts chapter 2 	Explained by Paul in Ephesians 4 	Modeled by Jesus in John 17 	Summarized in the Great Commandment and the Great Commission by Jesus    Gods 5 purposes for your life are:   	 Love God with all your heart  (worship) 	Love your neighbor as yourself (ministry) 	Go and make disciples (evangelism) 	Baptize them into  (fellowship) 	Teach them to do all things (discipleship)     "A great commitment to the great commandment and the great commission will make you a great Christian"   Practice the following four habits   	Talk it through with a spiritual partner or small group 	Give yourself a regular spiritual check up 	Write down your progress in a journal 	Pass on what you learn to others    I need to start doing habits 1 and 3 on a regular basis. I already practice habits 2 and 4.  I need to email Rick Warren at free@purposedrivenlife.com and ask for ALL of the free resources listed on page 324.

        I am happy to report that our little kingdom at the bottom of the hill on Mapleridge drive is getting cleaner one trailer at a time.  Last week I finished power washing two more trailers.  Atleast it was not freezing outside when I worked on those two.  I have one more trailer to do and then my power washing activities for 2004 should be complete.  Spring is finally in the air and trees and flowers are beginning to bloom.  I can not wait for WINTER to be FINISHED. I have had enough of this cold weather and the high electric bills.  I hope that we can enjoy some moderate weather where we can throw open the windows and doors and let our homes air out and do some serious cleaning.  GULP... Scratch the last thought, that is too much work.  LOL... Airing out the houses though is a good idea.    In the last two weeks I have done much better with regards to my average.  My league average is back up to 130 after bowling a 165 average last week and a 145 average last night.  Wahooooo!  Our team is in 9th place and after last night hopefully we have moved up to 8th place.  I bowled 142 in both my first and second games last night and if I could have done that all three games I would have gotten a patch.  Oh well....  What were the odds in that happening?  My job search for a BETTER job is still ongoing.  I am sending out resumes and applications but nothing is happening for now.  It appears that all doors are being shut with regards to better employment.  I am thankful for the job I do have but I NEED to find something better.  Something that pays more and has benefits.  I told someone the other day that I would rather wear the uniform of a security OFFICER than of a jail trustee because of not paying my child support.  Atleast in this situation I have the keys to the building and can come and go as I please. LOL...  I found out the other day that in South Carolina that the maximum that they incarcerate someone for failure to pay child support is 1 year.  It is a good thing for those inmates that they dont live in Texas.  In Texas they throw you under the jail until you pay up.  I heard the other day that a man was 4.00 short on his child support payment and the judge put him in jail.  The man was working two jobs and trying to get caught up on his payments and he wound up in jail anyway.  Now that is justice for you.  Not only was he out of work and lost his jobs probably but now he is getting even further behind on his responsibility to pay.  How is that justice?  How does that solve the problem?  I can tell that I need to stop this paragraph right here.  LOL....

       I found out yesterday that radio talk show host Marlin Maddoux passed away on March 4, 2004.  You can view his memorial page on the Internet at the following link.   urlLink In Memory of Marlin Maddoux   I was so sad to hear this news.  In the bible the apostle Paul says to be absent with the body is to be present with the Lord.  When we die in Christ we graduate from this life into life eternal where we will spend eternity with Christ and worship and praise him for eternity.  That is our Hope in that our redemption will come full circle and we will enjoy fellowship with our God forever.  Nevertheless when someone that passes away that has made an impact on our lives like Marlin Maddoux it is natural to grieve for a period of time.  Point of View is a Christian Radio Talk Show that has touched the lives of many people through the centuries.  The following paragraphs can be found on the Point of View website about Marlin Maddoux and the show he hosted.   Marlin Maddoux is founder and president of International Christian Media and host of Point of View Radio Talk Show, as well as a noted journalist and author.   Point of View is a two-hour, issues-oriented talk radio program heard daily via satellite on more than 360 radio stations nationwide and around the world by shortwave. Maddoux, founder and host of the program for more than twenty years, covers from a conservative Christian perspective the full spectrum of issues and current events that affect our homes, beliefs, schools, government, churches and basic freedoms. In 1986, Maddoux was given the National Religious Broadcasters Award of Merit. In 1994 Christianity Today magazine called Point of View America's "most popular live Christian call-in show."  In 1985, Maddoux founded USA Radio Network, a for-profit company, which today is one of the nation's fastest-growing news radio networks with more than 1,300 affiliated radio stations across the nation. USA radio news is also carried worldwide on the Armed Forces Radio Service. USA Radio Network's broadcast center is in northwest Dallas; the network also has news stringers in 45 countries of the world. In 1994, the National Religious Broadcasters awarded the USA Radio Network its "Program Producer of the Year" Award.  Maddoux has been a frequent guest on national television and radio broadcasts including, "CBS Morning News," ABC's "Nightline," ABC's "Good Morning America," "CNN," "Focus on the Family," and many others. He has been an invited guest at the White House on several occasions, having met with both President Ronald Reagan and President George Bush. He is the author of several books, including America Betrayed, What Worries Parents Most, Free Speech or Propaganda? and A Christian Agenda: Game Plan for a New Era. His latest book is a novel, Seal of Gaia, published by Word. He is currently working on the sequel to Seal of Gaia.  Maddoux and his wife, Mary, have four grown children and ten grandchildren and reside near Dallas, Texas    Have you heard of Larry Burkett and Crown Financial Concepts?  You can learn more about the ministry and life of Larry Burkett at the following link.   urlLink Crown Financial Concepts  The following paragraphs can be found on this website as well.   Larry Burkett  Following a long and courageous battle with cancer and heart disease, Larry Burkett completed his journey of serving the Lord Jesus Christ on this earth. Having battled cancer and heart attacks for the past several years, God called Larry into His presence at 3 am on July 4th.  To say that he will be missed is a huge understatement. Larry was truly loved by all those whose lives he touched; his family, his friends and his ministry partners. He lived a life of Christian kindness and genuine humility. He was always extraordinarily generous.   Steve Moore, Crown&rsquo;s radio co-host who spent so much time with Larry, related something that revealed a great deal about Larry. He said that while answering callers&rsquo; questions during Crown&rsquo;s Money Matters program, Larry&rsquo;s compassion was so evident. Listeners could not see, but could feel, his concern and even his tears for them.  One of the central principles Larry taught is that we don&rsquo;t really own things; we are simply stewards and managers of what God has entrusted to us. In Larry&rsquo;s case, that included the ministry he founded.  In 1971, Larry gave his life to Jesus Christ and committed to follow wherever the Lord would lead and to boldly teach the life-changing truths of Scripture. And he did this with all his might.   Needless to say both of these men have done their part to reach out and touch the body of Christ in a special way through the ministries that God entrusted to them.  They have certainly touched my life on many occasions and I join the rest of the body of Christ in honoring their lives and their obedience to the calling of Christ on their lives. Join me as we pray for the continuance of each ministry as well as their families that have been left behind here on earth.  We all know that we will be reunited one day on that glorious day when we leave this earth and re join our loved ones when the roll is called up yonder and we SHALL be THERE.    God bless

       Ok, I think it is finally official.  I fell off the deep end today never to return.  I finally understand why I keep having to toss the neighborhood cats out of the house when I open a window or a door.  I understand now why they keep scratching at the door, meowing endlessly and hanging around at all hours of the day and night.  The cats are hungry and they have decided that we are running a "kibbles & bits" kitchen for the neighborhood.  If the word gets out that I did this we will be in deep trouble.  I will have cats of all sizes, shapes and colors all the time.  You might have to call me Mr. Meow...  No, not the "cats meow" but MR Meow....  How about.....  Yes, I finally fell off the deep end.  I noticed today that every time I moved and looked around our house several felines kept moving away from me.  It was almost as if a magnet were sweeping small metal shavings around on the floor.  I move three feet forward they move three feet back.  I move 10 feet away from the food bowl they follow me as far as the food bowl.  I thought it was an interesting experiment so I picked up the food bowl to see if they would follow me.  No such luck.  I was hoping I could put the food bowl on roller skates and tie it to the back of my car and have them all follow me down the street.  I could not get that lucky now could I???    So, yes, after gazing into their starving little eyes I selected an old plastic cup and scooped out some food and put it on the back porch for the varmints to consume.  EVERY fiber in my being was telling me to NOT do that but I did it anyway.  Its almost as if there is a "Little BO Peep" person living in me that wants to come out and love all the animals.  Did you see the movie with Eddie Murphy where he was Dr. Doolittle and he could understand what all the animals were saying and speak with them?  You got it, I am married to one and the same. No, not Eddie Murphy but Dr. Doolittle nonetheless.  I think that she has secretly been brain washing me over the last 14 years because if not I would have never committed this act of lunacy.    I had the insane urge to give them a bowl of water too. Oh my gosh....  NO WAY.... The next thing you know I will be going down to Bi Lo to buy the cute little felines their own individual pint of milk with matching plastic bowls and bibs.  NOT and ABSOLUTELY NOT...  They can find liquid somewhere else.  I am NOT going to do it.  NO, I am not going to do it. I REFUSE.....  Maybe I have missed my calling.  I know that Katy has missed her calling with the way that she loves animals.  We both need to open up our very own street rescue mission for animals. It is a good thing that we have not done that so far.  We would run the SPCA out of business.    Gosh, now that I have that out of the way I feel better. It is a beautiful day today and I get to go to work in another 25 minutes.  Wahoooo.  We owe we owe off to work I go is my song that I sing as I pull out of the drive way each day.  I need to find a better, newer more snazzier tune I think.  After singing that one for about 20 times you get tired of it.  I want to sing something along the lines of  Hi ho, hi ho we won the lottery today!!  I guess you have to play the lottery to win it huh?  Are you REALLY still reading this?  hahahahahahaha

        I was on Google this morning doing a search on some things.  I did one on myself (James Moffitt) and I was the fourth entry from the top under authors with the name James Moffitt.  You can see the link here...   urlLink This Christian Life   Now, what is funny about all of this is that I really do not view myself as an AUTHOR...  I write for the fun of it, plain and simple.  I do not write for what little money that I can make.  I write because I like to write.  I like to write when I am inspired to write.  I like to write when I am passionate about something and want to share it with the world.  My friend and editor told me once that writing is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  My friend is certainly correct.  Writing can be a LOT of work.  I love the inspiration and passion of writing but sometimes you can get bogged down in the mechanics of putting thoughts to paper.  Making everything grammatically correct and doing the spell check etc.    This Christian Life is a wonderful web site filled with tons of talented authors who have take the time to share their talents with the world thanks to online publishing.  Just think, 20 years ago, most of us writers would have NEVER had the exposure to the reader audience that we have today.  Be sure to give this web site a visit and book mark it for return visits in the future.    God bless

        I am not sure if I am suffering from allergies, an ugly head cold or both.  I do know that "pollen is in the air" since our vehicles now stay a bright yellow.  Winter is officially gone yet it still remains a tad bit cool outside. I suppose that once Easter has come and gone this year that the warm weather will finally set in. I think that I am ready for the pollen to stop doing whatever it is doing and for the warm weather to arrive.  I have had enough of this cold weather to last me the rest of this year.    I started a part time job with Goodwill last week. They were looking for a PC Technician that can work part time doing refurb/repair/service and sales.  I work primarily on Saturday during the day doing sales and then a couple of two or three days during the week part time.  The money is certainly better than my security job which is a huge boost to our budget which seems to stay in the red most of the time.  Katy and I now have 3 jobs between us so hopefully we can manage to stay afloat from one 2 week period to the next.  It is disheartening to get paid every two weeks and then be broke 6 days from the next payday.  I know that we are probably not the only people that live from payday to payday.  Actually, I would like to get back to that point where we can live from payday to payday. LOL....     I forgot to tell you how I found this job. I was working 7 am until 3pm last Saturday down at the County Office Building in Charleston and my co worker Jorge told me about how I could go to Goodwill on Rivers avenue and purchase parts for computers at a reasonable rate.  I was looking for a pci video card for my kids game machine. The integrated sound card was a 1mb video card but that is not adequate to play most games.  So, I headed down to the Goodwill and purchased a used video card for 5.00 and it works fine.  I plugged it in and Windows 98 Operating System recognized the chipset and automagically installed the drivers for it.  So, thanks to a tip from my co worker I found out that Goodwill is looking for a part time pc tech.  I immediately went across the street and applied for the position and one week later I am working.  Wahooooo!  Well, maybe not all that excitement but atleast it is EXTRA income for the time being.  I am not sure how long this position is going to last but I suppose as long as Goodwill keeps receiving computer donations I will have something to refurb/repair and sell.  When that supply dries up I am sure that my part time job there will vanish.      If you go to  urlLink Cooper River Bridge Run  you will see that today is the day in 2004 when THOUSANDS of people run, jog or walk in the Cooper River Bridge run.  This is an annual event that has been going on for 27 years.  I thought about doing this the other day then I had a cool drink of water and the urge went away.  hahahahaha  However, I admire those people who are physically able and have the courage and stamina to enter the race and finish.  I am thinking that there are some brothers from Kenya that enter this race every year and usually win.  Does that really surprise us?  LOL....     I am so excited that we lost an hour to day light savings time last night before I went to bed.  Instead of it being 11:30 pm when I went to bed it was actually 12:30 am.  Who in the world invented day light savings time anyway?  urlLink Daylight Savings Time .  Well, I am glad that I just researched this website because now I REALIZE that I was not supposed to change the clocks until 2 am SUNDAY morning and not 11:30pm Friday night.  DOH......  I just cheated myself of one hour unnecessarily.  Whaaaaaaaaa.  Yes, now I am changing back my clocks.  BRB.... Thanks to blogging I realized my boo boo and now I fixed it back.  Now, I wish I could go back to bed and get that hour back but of course I am wide awake now.      On April 14th Jeremy turns 18 and on April 24, 2004 my son Jeremy will be going to his senior prom and then on May 23rd he will be graduating from high school.  urlLink Terry High School It is hard to believe that this much time has passed and Jeremy is going to be going off to college soon.  From what I understand he was able to obtain some band scholarships which will help him financially which is a good thing.  I believe that Jeremy's goal is to become a teacher and I am proud of that. If Jeremy does this then he will be following in his stepmothers footsteps.

        For now I think that I will utilize Life with Christ for a Jesus Connect Ministries Blog ONLY.  I will do that for exposure to the christian community there.  Hopefully some of those folks will check out what we are doing on our website and participate.    Until then I will do the personal weblog on Blogspot and Jesus Connect there.  Who knows, I might play with having multiple blogs on blogger.com instead.  Hopefully it will be a bit more seamless and less of a hassle.  I certainly appreciate all of the hard work and effort that Jeremy has put in to that website for Christians to use.

        Do you feel like MY guinea pig YET??  LOL, you should.... Ok , I think I have this figured out even though I am not happy with the results.  It appears that I can have multiple blogs on one service provider and I can post and publish to multiple blogs.  However, it appears that I can NOT post a message to my blogspot & lifewithchrist Blog at the same time. I have to create the message, cut and paste it into memory, post and publish to one account and then change accounts and post to the other.  I will demonstrate that in my next post so you can see what I mean jellybean......  :)

        I am experimenting with posting my blog to jcmoffitt.blogspot.com AND jcmoffitt.lifewithchrist.org  It appears that my blog on the Life with Christ blog mysteriously disappeared in the last 10 minutes so I am not sure what is up with that.  Hummmmm... Hey, its my day off and I guess I figured this would be fun to play with.   I am also toying around with a new w.bloggar plugin for Windows Media Player that is supposed to allow YOU my reading audience to see WHAT Music CD that I am currently listening to on my computer here at home.  Gosh, how is that going to work?  This must work through the Microsoft (Mickeysoft) .net architecture somehow.  Once I figure out HOW it works I will babble about it more in detail.  For now I am just hopping into this baby and giving it a spin to see what will happen.  hahahahaha  NO, I do not read manuals.  What fun is that??  Gosh, I think I finally figured out HOW to post and publish to multiple Web Logs using w.bloggar while I was writing this message.  BTW, Jeremy from Life With Christ wrote me back after my pinging him about something. Jeremy's respons we very quick and polite and I am very thankful for that.  Thanks Jeremy for your quick support.    Hummmmm what next.  Oh yeah, I need to post this to multiple blogs and see if this baby will blow up or not... hahahahahah

Apparently they offer you the ability to have a FREE Blog from their site which is nice.  Since they host Blogs there will probably be a wide variety of blogs to read as well.  The fact that they use RSS also makes me very happy which means I can keep up any new changes via Blog Express.  :)  As far as that goes I have approximately 32 RSS feeds that I keep up with every day.  I LOVE RSS , have I told you that?  LOL....  God bless

       urlLink Christian Question and Answer Epistles   We just celebrated Good Friday and Palm Sunday.  Easter is on April 11, 2004 and as you know there will be people going to church on this day that do not choose to go to church any other day of the year. Why is Easter so important that people buy new clothes and go to church on this day?  Perhaps buying clothes is not the issue but we all know that there are people that will go to church to show off their new duds.  Well, anyway, Easter is coming and it is VERY significant to those of us that identify ourselves with Christ by saying HE IS the LORD of LORDS and KING of KINGS.    We have all asked the question.  Should christians participate in pagan holidays such as Easter and Christmas or Halloween?  This question was posed and answered and I thought the article was good enough to share with you.     When you click on the URL I posted above you will need to scroll down past the dialog box where you can ask a question.  You will see a list of "past" questions posted.  The question I am talking about is the FIRST question.  Click on that link and you will be taken to that article.  Thanks     God bless

       Howdy from Duck Ditch USA where the trees are turning green and the  pollen (cough) is choking the life out of me.  hahahahahah  For the last week I have been fighting a combination of allergies  and a head cold. How much fun this has been.  NOT...  I am ready to  be done with this thing..       Spring break is upon us and Kristina and Justin are off from school  which means that Katy is also taking a break. So, its almost as if  we are on vacation with everyone being at home at the same time.  Wahoooo.      I am still working Security Sunday through Wed and Goodwill Thursday  Friday and Saturday. I have my doubts with how long this Goodwill  gig is going to last so I am trying to work as many days as I can  with US Security so when the Goodwill gig finally dies all I will  have to do is get one more day back for my schedule with US  Security.  So, I am working two part time jobs and Katy is working  her sub job for Berkeley county and we are surviving.  I keep  reminding myself that while life sucks in general I have things to  be thankful for. Let me list them below so I can be reminded of  these POSITIVE things again...    Our family is together and healthy We have a place to stay  We have food to eat Our cars are still running and we can get around We have a church home to attend who cares about us We have a place to serve in our church home We have an extended church and cypberspace family who cares about us We have angel and sammy (family dogs) who bring us joy and happiness We have our two birds who drive me crazy at times (LOL)     The bottom line is while it could be MUCH better for us it also  could be MUCH worse. I always try to remember the positive things in  life. God is the author of LIFE and while I have the ability to hear  my lungs draw in breath and feel the pulse of my heart beating I am  to be thankful for everything in my life, both good and bad. I am  reminded constantly that bad things do happen to good people. It is  so easy to get depressed about the garbage in our lives and if we  focus on those things all the time then we find ourselves deep in  the pit of depression and despondency. I know this because I  experience it.      I choose to live life above the levels of depression and despondency  that I speak of. I choose to focus on the positives and try to let  God handle the negative garbage in my life. I try to learn the  lessons that I am supposed to be learning and allow God to change my  heart and mind from the inside out. I know that through these things  in my life my faith is being tested and I am being molded more and  more into his image. Sometimes that molding requires trips to the  furnace where the garbage can be burned off and God can come shining  through to the surface.  The furnace gets awfully hot and the heat  can be painful but in the end I know it is for my own good and that  God receives the glory , honor and praise that HE is worthy of.      My son Jeremy who will be 18 years old on April 14th is graduating  from high school this May and going off to college. Jeremy managed  to get some band scholarships which is going to help tremendously  with the financial side of things.  I doubt that I will be able to  make the trip to Houston Texas on May 23rd to see Jeremy graduate  which really sucks.  In order to get cheap tickets for the flight I  need to be buying those tickets last month. Oh well, he knows that I  love him and I try to reach out to him in e-mail and through e- cards.  This is an exciting time in his life and it is a shame that  I am not there to be a part of it.     God bless

        April 14th Jeremy turned 18  April 24th Jeremy goes to High School Prom  May 4th  is Kristina's Birthday and she turns 12 this year  May 6th is Justin's Birthday and he turns 9   May 9th is Mothers Day   May 12th   is a wedding aniversary for James & Gizmo....  (14 GLORIOUS years...)   May 21st Gizmo gets one year OLDER....  May 27th Jeremy graduates from Terry High School        I am sure that the women in my life will correct me if I just screwed up on those dates.  The important thing is that these events are happening which is very cool.  :)  Gosh, I have an 18 year old graduating from high school.  Does that mean that he will be graduating college, getting married and presenting me with grand children before I know it?   Yipes.....  Thanks to Happy Days and Special Times I will be able to fly to Houston Texas so I can drive to Richmond Texas and see Jeremy graduating in person.  I am so excited about the possiblity coming to fruition.  Thank you Happy Days and the businessman who made the funds available so I can do this.  :)  I have been working 60 hours and 7 days per week for the last 2 to 3 weeks so I have been too busy to drivel in my favorite blog.  I need to find the time to do it though since I enjoy doing it so much....  Thanks to US Security scheduling too many people down at Charleston County Office building I wound up taking yesterday off and going bowling on the last night of the winter bowling league at Marrington Lanes.  This league is finally OVER!!  Yeah, I am SO happy about that for sure.  I think we wound up in 7th or 8th place.    Yes, on June 18th I will be joining the Travlers Bowling League which will be a summer league at the Royal Z Lanes in Goose Creek.  I shall NOT bowl at Marrington Lanes on a league ever again.  Why you ask?  Its simple.  They have synthetic lanes and for some reason I just can not bowl above a 130 average.  I seem to do much better on traditional bowling surfaces.  Last night I bowled a 122, 86 and 160.  What in the world happened on the middle game??  Whoooo boy.... That gave me a whopping 122 average for the night....  Oh well...  I surprised myself by prying myself away from the computer, put on my walking shoes and took a stroll in the neighborhood.  I walked 1.6 miles in 37 minutes which was a nice brisk pace for me. I even broke a sweat which is a good thing.  Myself and about 6 other men over at Battle Plan Ministries are holding one another accountable to eat LESS and excercise MORE.  That means that FAT BOY needs to eat LESS and exercise MORE starting today!!! That also means 3 meals per day and NO SNACKS when I get home at 11:30 pm.  It also means smaller portions.  I also need to get a new set of bathroom scales.  I found a nice bathroom scale that will handle up to 400 lbs and costs 40 bucks.  NO, I do not weigh 400 lbs. LOL.... I do weigh a tad over 300 though so that means I need scales that will tell me my true weight and not have to guess on our current scales that tend to spin like a propeller when I get on them....  LOL... Poor scales...  Speaking of propellers I am still trying to find a full time Information Technology job in the Charleston area.  I am currently working part time as a PC tech at a Goodwill Industries Outlet store in Charleston to make some extra mula and to keep my skills better than dull while the search continues.  This last week I saw 3 or 4 different positions in the Sunday paper.  Hopefully I can land one of them and trade my Security uniform (gorilla suit) for civilian clothes and some ethernet connectivity.  LOL...

       I came home today after a LONG day in MODEM HELL thinking I would curl up in my recliner with a Corona and some chips and cheese dip.  A tiny reward for not killing anyone at work nor throwing any computers through the service window.  LOL...    I stopped at the Kangaroo Mart on Redbank and gave away some life blood to the great GAS gOD who immediately reduced my checking account by 21.01.  Have you ever tried to stop one of those pumps right on the .00 mark?  It is not as easy as it looks.  At 21.01 I stopped and figured that if I run out of gas I can always leave the car on the side of the road and hitch a ride with someone else if I am out of money.  It does not take long for that to happen does it?  There is ALWAYS more month than there is pay check.  Our cost of living continues to rise yet our wages remain the same or get smaller.  Atleast that is how it has been working for me in the last 2 years.  I try to console myself to the fact that atleast I am not in Iraq being bombed as I whine about this.  LOL...  I guess THAT could put things in perspective.    Oh yes, the GIFT that keeps on giving.  I wandered over to my desk to put my laptop bag down and remove the extra weight of the key ring in my right hand.  As I turned around to turn on our computer I noticed a familiar and disgusting smell.  At about the same time my nose was curling inward I noticed that there was what appeared to be a "mud pie" sitting close to the computers in amongst several wires that run from this computer peripheral and that.  Imagine my instant surprise, revolt and disgust that hit me all at the same time.  I was like  "and what the HE** is this kids??  Of course, that was pretty idiotic for me to ask that when my nose and eyes had already delivered the message to my brain that a COW had delivered an unwelcomed surprise to my computer area.  OH MY GOSH....  As you can imagine my brain started looking for a culprit to pin this on as well as involuntary labor to ASSIST me in listening to my excessive belly aching as well as removal of the toxic waste dump.  Kristina and Justin were the lucky participants in that game called "oh my gosh, its time to plug our nose and pick up the doo doo....."  Yes, we bonded in this moment in more ways than one.  I think that as I write this that my blood pressure is now returning to normal.    There are seveal reasons why this transpired today.  Shall we examine them one by one?    A. Mother Moffitt flew the coop and went out of town to be at a weekend long crop B. A typhoon of some type camped itself on top of Duck Ditch USA and unloaded untold amounts of water all day long therefore leaving the MUTTS to their own devices with regards to potty trips. C. the Moffitt children have a problem understanding WHY we are taking the dogs out for a walk to begin with.  Now lets examine items A,B and C in more detail.    When Mother Moffitt flies the coop for whatever reason for whatever amount of time the environment of peace and tranquility and all sense of normalcy implodes in on itself.  Regular routines, chores, and whatever else you want to call it begins to unravel at a high rate of speed.  Its a good thing Katy does not leave for any EXTENDED length of time, she might come back to a huge gaping hole in the ground where the trailer used to sit.   When it rains buckets the dogs have a case of Parkinson disease and they forget that their daily duties have not been permanently put on pause.  They eat drink and beg for more food from anything that has some and then do more and more of that until they are NEEDFUL of a trip outside.  You guessed it.  The containers are only so big.  After a while when you put too much goo in the bottle something is bound to escape.  :)  Kristina and Justin view taking the dogs outside as a drudgery which is entirely designed to punish them and rob them of an opportunity to otherwise have fun entertaining themselves with some other mindless activity.  They forget how important it is that the exercise is one that is PRODUCTIVE with VISIBLE results.  But DADDY, we DID take the dogs out.  I always ask them,  did you take them out for longer than 25 seconds this time or did you run them around the yard and bring them back inside thinking that something had escaped both hounds through the process of osmosis....   When I ask IF they SAW the dogs DO anything I always get this incredulous stare as if to say, OH you want is to WAIT for this process to happen even though the dogs think they have an ETERNITY for it to happen?  You get the picture here.  We beat the dogs for any unwelcomed treats left that we dont want so they in turn return the favor by becoming mindless blogs of hair, nails and teeth when they get outside knowing full well what is expected of them.  When you try to manipulate them into moving the process along sometime in this millenium they look up at you as if saying " you KNOW you brought this upon yourself so do not EVEN start this whining crap with me."     Oh yes, back to MODEM HELL....    I think that HELL is going to be full of Microsoft Windows products and broken hardware parts for a typical IBM capatible computer.  Today I think that I gained atleast one more grey hair.   Modem HELL opened up its gates wide at about 2:30 pm in one of our customers (Goodwill PC Recycling Center) came back with one of the prize computers he purchased from me last weekend.  This was an IBM computer and the modem was not working.  The customer told me it was not working because he could not get online.  By this time in the day I was by myself in the service center and anyone else with half a brain had the good sense to jump in their cars, mopeds, bicycles, pogo sticks or flying carpets and long since left me in their vapor trail.  So, here I am with my MR Customer Service hat on with the good intention of fixing this problem quickly.    I fired up the IBM which is loaded with ME (Microsoft Millenium) and went into the control panel looking for the modem icon to see what was ailing our "modulater/demodulator" device.  When I arrived I found the modem sitting in his room quietly watching me approach not having a care in the world.  When I clicked on the modem and went to the diagnostic tab I found that the modem was talking back to the given AT commands.  At this point I am thinking "the modem works but the customer does not know how to configure his Internet Software DOH...."  I hook up the phone line to the modem and guess what.  The Internet software did not get a dial tone from the modem.  The OS saw the modem but the modem apparently had its mouth wired shut because no dial tone from Ma bell was making a trip.  At this point we are about 25 minutes into this quick fix.   When I realized that the modem was a deaf mute I pulled it out and started the nightmarish process of plugging in other modems and at the same time getting the computer on our local area network so I could visit my favorite place of all times " www.driversguide.com".  Do you think that the NIC card in this IBM would cooperate or do you think I had to fight with that for ANOTHER 5 to 8 minutes ?  You guessed it, whatever was ailing the modem had crept into the NIC.  One new NIC later and 4 minutes of fussing and I had that IBM howling on our LAN.  Three USED modems later and about 30 min I looked at the customer and said.  If you want this to happen today BEFORE 6pm you will need to go to Wallyworld and buy a NEW modem, bring it back to me and I will THEN be able to get you out of the door within 10 min.    In 20 minutes my customer returned after swimming down Rivers Ave to Wally World and being 32.00 poorer handed me a brand new US Robotics Internnal V.92 modem.  I again told him, you will be AMAZED at how fast this process is going to be and you will be on your way with a fully functional computer that will get you on the Internet.  There is an unspoken rule when working on computers.  NEVER replace an item and then put the lid on and screw it down. You will ALWAYS forget something and even if you dont the hardware KNOWS that it has a mind of its own and it will FORCE you to open the case up again anyway.  You also NEVER brag to anyone about HOW easy this is going to be and how FAST you are going to have them out of the door.  Just as soon as you do that you will have more distractions and problems than Carter has liver pills.    Anyway, the NEW modem installed, ME recognized the modem, gobbled up the appropriate driver off the CD ROM.  When I go to the modem applet in control panel to do the diagnostics number there are two com ports but NO MODEM installed.  I get an error message that says something to the affect that " the modem is not installed correctly and the inf file is corrupt.  Please remove this modem and reinstall it again."  I did that numerous times and finally just gave up on it thinking that this is a bad computer.  I went into the sales room and grabbed one of the PII 300 mhz machines that was for sale and put the NEW modem in it thinking, something must be bogus with the IBM, I will just jam this card in here and have him out in another 10 min.  NOT... Same process, same error message.   Can you believe that through this all I have not cursed once nor have I thrown the computer or MODEMS through the glass window of the service department.  Can you believe that the customer lived out in Walterboro and had been up all night and decided to wait this entire time for me to fix his computer so he would not have to come back.  He also never raised his voice nor did he once holler at me or the computer.  Kuddos to this cool cat !!  It became painfully apparent to me that this was just NOT going to happen no matter how I held my mouth or howled at the moon.  I finally grabbed the last good computer off the sale room floor and tested the modem in it which appeared to be working normally and told the customer that he was getting a FREE upgrade.  He went from a PII 266 to a PII 333 with a bigger hard drive and more RAM.  IF the modem works for him when he finally gets home then he will possibly be a happier camper.  If NOT someone (probably me) will be praying to the modem midgets (wherever they reside) asking them to make this situation fix itself quickly BEFORE I go screaming out the back door of Goodwill.  LOL....

      I thought you might find this application handy in the future.  I use this on a daily basis in my job as a PC Technician at Goodwill.  Check it out!  Freeware!!   urlLink Everest Home Edition Software   The product is Everest Home Edition which is free.  Download it, install it and check out all of the system information that it gives you.   :)  In the past I used an application such as Aida32 which is from the same programmer that is now writing Everest products.    Enjoy

      My first day off and what do I do?  I have FUN, that is what I do.  I spend time with my sweet wife Katy and we go do all sorts of stuff.  Well, not really, but we are having a nice day off doing what we like the most, spending time with one another.  The children are at school and mom and dad are running the streets of Charleston.  I recently purchased a SanDisk Wireless 802.11b wireless CF card with a PC Card adapter for the sole purpose of wireless Internet connectivity with my laptop and/or Pocket PC.  Last night I surfed one of the WiFi websites and searched for businesses with WAP (Wireless Access Points) or Hotspots in Goose Creek.  Guess how many businesses have this?  A big fat ZIPOLA!!!  Not a one.  Oh well, Charleston has about 15 hot spots so we chose to drive down 526 to Sam Rittenburg to visit our new found friends at Drogo Coffee at 2048 Sam Rittenburg.  The ladies gave me my coffee, my access code for 30 min Internet connectivity and off I went to my new digital adventure.  I am noting on my watch that I have 11 minutes of online access before I have to PAY for more. Gulp....  Nothing is free folks.  Not even wirelss Internet access.  Well, if you pay for the goods they do give you some free Internet time to access your favorite Internet web site or check your email.   I will say that while the Pocket PC did gain access to the WAP at Drogo's much faster than the laptop that the TINY Internet Explorer screen was VERY frustrating.  After spending 10 minutes of moving the scroll bar horizontally and vertically several dozen times to navigate a simple web form I was all but DONE with that experience.  So, with that said, if I need to get on the WEB to do anything it is not going to happen via the Pocket PC.  As for downloading my email perhaps that would be a quicker method than firing up the laptop.  One thing that I am noticing is that this is no different than being logged on to any other LAN in that you can receive e-mail via Outlook but you can not SEND e-mail via Outlook.  You are forced to use a web based email client to SEND email.  That is because the Systems Administrators that run the Email gateways have gotten smart and no longer allow their email servers to be email relays which is an open gateway for spammers.  In other words you have to be logged on to the ISP's network in order to send mail from their email server.  I also noticed that I can not use my w.bloggar application to post to my blog.  Never fear , the web browser interface at www.blogger.com works just fine.  :)  Well anyway, so much for this techno drivel.  I will expound upon the technical problems I experienced later this afternoon or evening after we get back from the movies.  I will be warping out of here to the land of www.fandango.com to see the movie listings now.  See ya later aligator!!!

       urlLink DSM Tapes   Duane Sheriff Ministries is out of Oklahoma. I met a truck driver the other night while working security at a truck lot in Mt Pleasant. This truck driver was a believer in Christ and gave me four tapes that he orders.  This man gets 200 tapes per month or thereabouts and when he is driving over the road he listens to these teaching tapes.  I can not tell you how blessed I was just after listening to one of these tapes on Faith.  I want to encourage each of you that are reading this to think about blessing yourself by filling your mind and soul and spirit with the teaching ministry that this man has to offer.  God bless

      Have I told you how much I LOVE retail customers?  If I have not please allow me to share some of the LOVE... LOL  Do not get me wrong, customers are NOT an interruption to my day, they are the REASON I am here.  Customers are usually ALWAYS right no matter how WRONG they might be. As you can imagine, that thought process can always mire you down in a lot of silliness pretty quickly...   This morning I was reminded of why I prefer to work in the service department vs the sales room.  Guess who reminded me of this fact?  You got it, a customer.... I walked into the sales room because one of my employees told me that he needed help because he was too busy.  So , I walk in and offer to sell a customer with their comptuer selection.  I was told that they did not want me to help them but that they would rather wait on my employee to help them instead. I graciously asked them if I could assist them since my employee was assisting another customer and they told  me pointedly that they did not need my assistance and that they would be happy to wait.    Gosh, I felt loved and appreciated after that comment. LOL... NOT     James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net

        So you are asking,  "what the heck is blogrolling?"  I am just now learning myself so be patient while I make a weak and slightly ignorant attempt at explaining this.  I have had our Blog now for almost 2.5 years.  Our Blog is listed in several Blog databases that are searchable.  The problem is this.  Even though our Blog url is listed in the database and is searchable it does not do me much good if no one knows that I am alive and that they can search for me.    So, with that in mind the next step is to take this Blog thing to the next level.  Technorati is in the Beta stages of tracking over 2 MILLION Blogs.  Once their Web Spider comes to my Blog url and verifies that I am who I say I am ( the author of the Blog) then they will validate my Blog Authorship and put me in their Technorati database and in turn I can keep track of whomever adds my Blog url to their Links Page.   Is that clear as mud yet?  LOL....  Like I admitted earlier, I am still learning about Blogrolling and how it will give me some sort of advantage.  Once the web spiders have done their thing you can click on the Technorati Profile link above the Contributors Text on the right side and it will take you to my custom Technorati Profile on their web site. What that will do for me is beyond my comprehension at this point.  What I do know is that I have fulfilled all the prerequisites that I needed to do in order to have a membership with their service.  The FREE service does not allow me to have all the "bells and whistles" but its a start.   As I learn more you will hear about it.    Happy Blogging folks!!!

       My goodness, I posted something to my blog from work this afternoon and was forced to use the web interface at blogger.com and was pleasantly surprised by the NEW LOOK.  Wow, I am VERY impressed with what Blogger has done with the new web site and user interface for us Blogger junkies.  :)  I selected a NEW template and I turned on comments for new comments. That means I "expect" for you to say something back to me.  LOL... Keep it clean and try to be nice because I will have the ability to (cough) delete any nasties someone might try to leave.  Please forgive me, my lawyers made me put that little disclaimer in should one of your comments wind up in the recycle bin.  :)  Anyway, nice stuff.  The only thing I do not understand is why my picture is not showing up next to our "Contributors" section on the right hand side.  I will have to mess with that functionality some more until I have success.  I also noticed that the pics from Kristina and Jeremy REALLY messed up the template formatting and shoved all my archive and contributor information all the way to the bottom. For now I just put links to the pictures on our server.  That way folks can just open up a new browser window and look at the pictures there.    Wahooooo  Thanks Blogger!!

      I have received this before in e-mail and it is so good that I wanted to put it on my blog.  When is the last time you ran through the rain and just enjoyed getting wet??  I think that the next time it rains that I am going to try it out with my kids and see if they pass out.  LOL...     A little girl had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful red haired, freckle faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has no time to flow down the spout. We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart.   We waited, some patiently, others irritated because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child came pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.   The little voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in "Mom, let's run through the rain," she said.   "What?" Mom asked.   "Let 's run through the rain!" She repeated.   "No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit," Mom replied.   This young child waited about another minute and repeated: "Mom, let's run through the rain,"   "We'll get soaked if we do," Mom said.   "No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning," the young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.   This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?   "Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, 'If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!"   The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear you couldn't hear anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few minutes.   Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say. Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young child's life. A time when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith.   "Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If GOD let's us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing," Mom said.   Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they darted past the cars and yes, through the puddles. They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked. But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars.   And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.   Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories...So, don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories everyday. To everything  there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven.   A friend sent this to me to remind me of life. Hope you enjoy it.   I HOPE YOU STILL TAKE THE TIME TO RUN THROUGH THE RAIN.   They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them. Send this to the people you'll never forget and remember to also send it to the person who sent it to you. It's a short message to let them know that you'll never forget them.   If you don't send it to anyone, it means you're in a hurry.   Take the time to live!!!   Keep in touch with your friends, you never know when you'll need each other -- and don't forget to run in the rain!    God makes everything but unbreakable hearts.

        I like to write when I am inspired to say something.  When I do not write does that mean that I am not inspired or that I just don't have time to capture my thoughts and share them with you my reading audience?  Maybe a little bit of both.  Can you tell that I struggled with the "title" of todays drivel?  LOL....  I always ask myself, "ok, what is the title for todays thoughts??".  Today I just gave up and put keywords that I will probably write about and left it at that.    Today marks day two in which I got off my lazy behind and did something other than sit in front of my 21" NEC monitor and fight pop up ads and dodge the other myriad of marketing ads that assail me each day.  I wonder if the marketing geniuses will ever figure out that we really do not care to KNOW about ALL of their products nor do we care to give up every single red cent that we work hard for just so we can say that we have this and that.  I am sure that marketing is a numbers game and the more you get the message in front of US the more chances that we will open up our check book or give out our credit card numbers online.  I guess I just get tired of the constant marketing blather.  I am quite happy with how long or short my body parts are or are not.  LOL...  Really people, I understand that this is the age of coming out of the closet but I still think there are things that still belong there.  KWIM??  There are things that REALLY ought not be a part of normal conversation between friends.  Some things are just too private.  Those things are to be dealt with between myself, God and perhaps the family doctor on occasion.  No one else needs to know about it.  The folks that create television ads and the sponsors that pay millions of dollars annually to talk about it during prime time TV are still clueless.  Do we really want to hear a conversation between two grown adults about how they have overcome the stresses and trials of having genital herpes?  I for one do not...  Anyway, I just chased a huge rabbit around the room and finally down the hole from whence it came from.  :)  Back to the exercise comment at the top of that paragraph.  Yes, I walked with my wife yesterday and then I got up this morning at 7 am and walked again.  Two days in a row and 3.2 miles later I managed to torture my body and forced it to do some exercise.  In the war of overcoming obesity I understand that two days of victory does not mean that I have won the war.  What it does mean is that for two days straight I have been victorious in the battle for two days to do what is right.  The goal is less food intake and MORE exercise.  Preferably aerobic exercise but for now the morning walks will have to do.  I have not checked my pulse rate and I am not sure it goes up to 120 bpm but I am sure that it is much higher than what it would be if I was sitting here in front of the computer playing High Stakes Poker on Pogo.com.  Runt ro, I just let it slip.  Yes, I love to play poker on pogo.com.  Play money folks, just play money for those of you that are wondering how in the world I can afford that.  LOL... Everything is FREE other than the high speed Internet connection.  No, that is not going anywhere if I can help it.  Thus far today I ate honey nut cheerios and a banana for breakfast along with 2 cups of decaf coffee and for lunch Katy and I had a cup of rice and chicken soup and a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich.  For supper I will have a can of Slimfast and a Slimfast bar.    I have found that walking and driving are excellent times for prayer and meditation and talking to God.  It is also a wonderful time to listen for God to talk back and communicate to me something back.  It is so easy to make demands and be greedy during prayer.  It is yet another thing to take time to shut up and to listen for the voice of God.  When you are driving your prayers are always interrupted by a need to ask God to protect you from the rest of the maniacs driving all around you.  KWIM??  During my morning walks all I have to contend with is the messages being sent from my knees, ankles and feet and the sound of mother nature all around me.  When was the last time you took the time to admire the leaves in a tree, the sounds of the different birds or the antics of frolicking squirrels?  We live such a high impact, high stress , task filled life.  There are more things to do and demands on our time that we fail to take time for the things in life that are more important.  The peace that passes all understanding and the Joy of the Lord does not happen when you are running at mach 2 with your hair on fire.  The only way that we will enjoy or experience Joy or Peace is by taking the time to reconnect to Abba Father.  You can do that in the 30 minutes that it takes to walk around the block or run on the tread mill.  Maybe you ride a bicycle or go swimming.  Whatever it is that you do that gives you an opportunity to connect with your creator I would suggest you try doing it on a regular basis.  God will bless you by making himself known to you in the still quietness of your heart and He will bless you by manifesting himself all around you.  When you tap into the power of God and His purposes for your life all of your task lists will diminish greatly and all of a sudden you will wonder why you have been allowing the junk of life to stress you out.    Today as I walked off of Riverside Drive onto Old Backriver Rd I encountered a possum.  This particular possum did not make the nocturnal trip from one side of the road to the other.  I am not sure what distracted him but it is obvious by the look on his face that he had something meet him in the middle of the road that he was not expecting.  This surprise encounter happened to end his life.  I stood in the middle of the road for a few moments with my hands on my hips and took in the scene.  I was reminded that life is but a season.  Our lives are but a vapor.  We are here today and gone tomorrow.  I was also reminded that sometimes on the road of life we find ourselves just like the possum, this mornings road kill.  We stand in the middle of the road with our mouths open and our eyes affixed on something we should not be looking at or thinking absent mindlessly about something that is not even important.  I guess you could say that we are either running headlong into danger or we are sitting in neutral when we should be doing the exact opposite.   Life is full of road blocks.  Life is full of pot holes and land mines that will do nothing more than to blow off your toes or wreck your little red wagon.  How we navigate, how fast we navigate and how skillfully we navigate will determine our level of pain and success in crossing the road.  I can see some of the possum in me.  Only by the grace of God has God picked me up and closed my mouth and gotten my attention and put me back on the straight path.  God has a way of focusing our minds on those things that are important and showing us how frivolous the tiny things of life really are.  Things and entertainment are not what is important to God.  God owns all the things and we all have more of those then we can manage already.  God does not mind our being entertained from time to time but he certainly did not create us for the purpose of being mindlessly entertained.  God created us for a purpose and that purpose is to worship Him in all that we do and say.  Have you heard that our life is Gods gift to us and what we do with our life is our gift back to God?  Think about the many opportunities we get during a day to give back to God and his creation all around us.    Tomorrow marks 14 glorious years of marriage to my wife Katy.  It is hard to believe that through it all we are still together despite the challenges, trials and tribulations that we have endured.  It is evident to me that Jesus must be in the center of our marriage because if it were up to me or Katy this marriage probably would have blown apart years ago.  The power of God in our lives individually and as a family corporately is the glue that has held us together.   I thank God daily for my family.  They are such a wonderful blessing to me.  I would not want to imagine what life would be without them surrounding me.  They increase the quality and quantity of my life exponentially.  Thank you Jesus for my family and for my life that you have given me.

        In two weeks I will be flying to Houston to spend time with my son  Jeremy and other friends for four days.  I am so ready to take 4  days off in a row.  I have not had two days off in a row since the  end of March when I started working part time for Goodwill.  I was  speaking to a friend of mine (ex employer) who told me via IM the  other day that he is going to provide me with a hotel room for the 4  days that I am there so that is a HUGE Praise the Lord.  That means  that I will have my own bed to sleep in and some privacy when I need  it.  :)  I was thinking the other day about how good God is to me and my  family. With regards to this "need" or "desire"  I never petitioned  God for it. I never prayed and asked God to provide this for me.   Apparently someone in this group did and thanks be unto God he moved  on the hearts of several people and now I am going to Houston.  How  wonderful is that?  It just goes to show ME that God IS interested  in every detail of my life.  I thank God every day for his provision  for our family.  He continues to provide us with our needs and some  of our wants every single day.    Summer break is almost upon us folks. YIPES!!  That also means Camp  Happy Days is almost upon us.  Kristina and Justin are counting the  minutes for this event.  :)  Isn't that amazing?  In this world when  you lose a loved one after the funeral everyone goes away and life  is supposed to go back to normal for everyone and you and your  family are left to deal with the grief pretty much on your own.   Thanks to the loving support of HDST we are never alone. We are all  part of one big family.  All we have to do is stand up and holler  about whatever it is that we need to holler about and someone will  respond in some way.  I am so thankful that my children have Camp  Happy Days to attend each year and that they are going to witness  and be a part of such a wonderful organization and the annual event  that takes place for kids with cancer and their siblings.    On a different note personally I have been trying to watch how much  I eat, what I eat and getting more exercise. This week I walked 1.6  miles 4 times or 6.4 miles.  I have a path that I walk in the  mornings.  I drove my car around and found it was approximately 1.6  miles and I usually walk it in about 30 minutes.  The first couple  of times were tough.  Now that I have done it for several weeks in a  row I have gotten to where I miss doing it. I have found that I have  more energy during the day and it helps me to deal with the stress  of life as well.  I spend this time walking down the country roads  in my neighborhood and talking to God.  I also try to shut up and  listen to HIM and I don't spend the whole time asking God to meet  this need or that.  don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with  asking God to meet our needs or asking for a particular want.   However it is good practice to spend time quietly at HIS feet and  try to listen for HIM to instruct us and to encourage us in our  daily journey.  Prayer is very powerful and I can say for a fact  that if I did not have quiet time with my Lord through prayer ,  reading of His word and fellowship with other believers that I would  be in dire trouble.  These morning walks have enabled me to draw  closer to him and to separate myself temporarily from the garbage of  this world.  So, with that in mind pray that I  will continue to walk as often as possible and to NOT stick so much  junk into my face.  I need to excercise more and eat less.  A simple  concept that is hard to do when you are so used to having the habit  of doing just the opposite.  Katy is studying for her exam that she will take in June. I will let  her tell you all the gory details but basically she will be able to  get her emergency teachers certificate in SC if she passes.  The  test has been paid for (thank you Jesus) and the study materials  purchased. Pray that Katy will be able to retain this information  well enough to pass the exam.   On next Thursday I am going by GSP off of Rivers Avenue.  It stands  for Good Source (P???).  LOL, whatever. Anyway, this is a training  facility implemented by Goodwill industries.  They offer all sorts of  technology training.  They have a 5 week PC repair course. They have  all sorts of software application training, A+ certification and  MCSE certification training.  I spoke to the office manager about my  needing to pursue my MCSE so that I can find a BETTER job in this  current market and she told me that my cost as an employee of  Goodwill would be around 1000.00.  Currently the cost of an MCSE  cetification IF you go to a classroom setting is around 4k.  So, the  fact that they offer it for 2k or 50% less than most training  facilities is awesome.  The fact that I can get 50% off of that is  even more awesome.  Then again, having 1000.00 might as well be my  having 1 million at this point in the game.  Nevertheless I am going  to go check out the facility and see about financial options and how  I might be able to get some sort of funding to get this badly needed  certification.  I have 15 years of experience in this field and now  I cant find a job partly because of no certification.  Yes, this is  a need and a prayer request so please pray for this. :)  Well, enough babbling from James.  I need to get away from this desk  and go for my walk. I did not walk yesterday so I need to go this  morning before church.  :)

      Coming to you live from Houston Texas where it is cloudy, HOT and humid.  Once again I am reminded WHY I do not miss Houston Texas.  LOL.  The only difference between Charleston SC and Houston at the moment is that Houston is atleast getting some rain and that water is another reason for the high humidity in the air.    It has been 6 weeks since this trip to Houston Texas was planned and I waited with anticipation.  The plane rides were relatively uneventful but I have to say that after 1 hour and 45 minutes of riding in the same seat mashed together in coach with two other unlucky occupants that I was extremely happy to get off the Jet in Houston yesterday evening.   I was quite impressed with the new Rental Car complex that they built on the north side of Houston close to Intercontinental Airport aka George Bush IAH.  There was a shuttle bus that picked me up and shot me out to the main complex to rent the car and I was immediately ushered into the rental car and shown the exit where I verified my reservation.  Nice car, nice service.  What a deal folks!!    Once I was in the rental car I was reminded of one thing that I do not miss and that is the hellish driving habits of the 4 million other people who drive like bats exiting hell through one hole.  LOL....  I had not been in Houston driving for much longer than 25 minutes when I found myself slamming on the brakes heading for the emergency lane wondering if there was some nice soft grass on the other side of the concrete barrier that was coming up a little too quick.  It appears that as I was trying to exit off of I-45 South onto 610 West that three cars ahead of me there was someone in a black Ford Mustang who had slammed on its brakes in an attempt to get off an exit that they had already passed about 2 car links back.  OH MY GOSH people.  Lets take some prozac or something to calm ya down...  Once I was in Houston I picked up my friend James Carberry and headed out to sit in the parking lot on I-10 West headed out to Dairy Ashford and Don Coleman Stadium where the commencement ceremonies were to be held.  We managed to grab a bite to eat (snack) and made it to the auditorium around 7:10 pm.  It is a good thing we arrived 50 minutes early because the auditorium filled up quickly.  I had called my friend Tom Whitten and Donel to come to Jeremy's graduation but Tom was the only one who made it.    The ceremony itself lasted about 2 hours.  From what I could see there were approximately 5000 people in the stands and then the graduates on the floor all dressed in Terry Highschool RED and the staff who had on black robes.  James Carberry was kind enough to man the video camera for me and I spent most of my time on my feet up on the top row taking pictures with our new Canon AE-1.  I was disappointed in the fact that at the top of the arena that the people who were not sitting down in the auditorium were talking loudly instead of being quiet and respectful.  I guess if you were in the actual seated area of the convention center you did not hear everything that was going on up at the top level.  I was very pleasantly surprised that several of the students who spoke gave Jesus Christ the praise , honor and glory for their success and stated that together with God on their side that they could go on and overcome anything the world would throw at them.  The prayers that were lifted up were very humble and not full of religous rhetoric.  I was very pleased as a parent to hear the young people giving God the credit for their lives and their accomplishments.    I am sitting at James Carberry's office.  James works for a printing company and no, I do not know the name of it right as I am writing this.  Hugh, who is James's boss gave me permission to use his high speed network access to sponge e-mail and write my blog.  I have to stop for now because the burgers that they cooked on a grill are now ready and my stomach is calling.   God bless

        I am now walking approximately 4 out of 7 days per week 1.6 miles in 30 minutes in our neighborhood.  That is better than what I was doing 6 weeks ago which was not much.  The other day I was at the Pastor's house helping them with some computer issues when his wife and daughter made mention that I was losing some weight.  I know that I have probably not lost much but I do know from the way my pants are fitting me looser that I am atleast toning up a bit even if the weight loss is very gradual.  I am also feeling much better and I have more energy than before.  That energy level increasing has given me more self confidence and the ability to suck it up and go for that proverbial walk even when my body wants to be lazy in the morning.    I am having more luck with the increased exercise than I have been with my diet.  I need to find the same will power and tenacity when it comes to sticking less calories into my head.  The BEST way to lose weight is to EAT LESS and EXERCISE MORE.  Repeat this after me.   EAT LESS EXERCISE MORE  Yes, I know, easier said than done.  :)  It seems as if the body has a mind of its own.  No pun intended..... Maybe the body (flesh) KNOWS that I am planning something silly with regards to denying it of what IT wants and it preemptively shuts down all the logic and will power circuits in my mind and takes over from there by opening my mind and starting the hand to mouth reflex problems....    Have you noticed how many people in your community have mad cow disease?  No, I, we are not alone.  Lets face it, us Americans are just down right obese.  Someone said the other day that there is no shortage of food therefore we do not need to eat EVERYTHING in sight and that we just have access to way too much food to begin with.  I never really thought about it that way but whoever said it is right.  We do have access to way too much food.       Ok, enough said about mad cow disease.  I am going to take my mind (and yours) off of the calorie counting madness and diving off into one of my favorite hobbies which would be photography.  If you have know us (me) for long you had access to our www.fototime.com picture archive in which we had almost 1500 photos online.  I took those photos in the space of the last 3 years.  I guess you could say that I am a shutterbug at heart.  I hate being on the business end of the camera but I LOVE being on the other end.  The other day I noticed that there was a Canon AE1 35mm camera with a 50mm lens for sale at Goodwill.  The price was 19.95 with 50% off which brought the grand total to 9.95.  Yes, you guessed it, I am providing a new home for this camera.  I was also told that someone saw a zoom lens for it lying around but I was unable to find it.  So, with that in mind we now have another means of taking photos other than our digital camera or 8mm camcorder.  Tomorrow I will be burning the first roll of film at Kristina's awards ceremony in the hopes that it will take some decent pictures.  The proof will be in the negatives per sa...  LOL....  If the pictures turn out I will take the camera with me to Houston and use it to take some pics there during the graduation as well as some of the sights there.  I think that I saw something about Photoblogging over on Blogger.com.  Gosh, imagine that, driveling through pics....  LOL...  The fun thing about using the Canon AE1 is that there is nothing automatic about it.  With the advent of the technology age we live in everything is digital and automatic.  Just point and click and the electronics does all of the work for you.  Not so with the Canon AE1.  You have to know HOW to use the different settings and I am embarrased to say that I have fallen victim to the technical simplicity of things and I have forgotten almost everything I ever learned about photography using this type of camera.  With that said, it took me several moments to figure out HOW to open the back of the camera to load film.  Just today I figured out how to remove the 50mm lens but it took me much longer to figure out HOW to put the silly thing back on.    Once I know that I know that the camera is still fully functional and I can figure out all of the different settings then I will begin the search for some CHEAP accessories for this camera.  I will be needing a auto winder, zoom lenses and a flash unit and camera bag.   I will be keeping my eyeballs peeled (ouch) over at Goodwill to snag any more good camera deals that come along in the near future.

        Our children are growing up before our very eyes.  Just the other day we registered our kids for the 2004 school year and now that year has flown right past our eyes.  Kristina and Justin both managed to survive the year and even came out of the experience by learning some valuable lessons and gaining some awards and acknowledgement from their peers and teachers.  I am going to have to build a shrine (book case) for Kristina's bedroom to hold all of the awards, trophies and such.  Kristina was on the A B honor roll this year and had perfect attendance.  Tomorrow we will be going to the awards ceremony at her school at 8:30 am.  Today Katy went to Justin's school and ate lunch with him and attended his awards ceremony in which he received the "Best Author" award and "Best Otter" award as well.  Justin went from struggling with his reading and speech skills to bringing his level up to the grade level he was in this year which is a HUGE accomplishment for him.  Gosh, I am so proud of my children.  Lets not forget my son Jeremy.  Jeremy is graduating from High School this coming Thursday and thanks to Happy Days and Special Times I will be able to be there to watch him walk across the podium and take his certificate.  Jeremy will be going on to college thanks to some Band scholorships and the help of his parents.  I wish that I could take more credit for Jeremy's accomplishments but I can not.  Jeremy has turned out to be quite a young man that makes me very proud.  Jeremy has overcome some pretty big hurdles in his life and has shown me and others that he is capable of doing what he puts his mind to.  Jeremy will be going to community collge next year and then going on to a university setting the following year.         It has been almost 3 years since our Jessica graduated from this world into the presence of God.  I can not imagine the experiences our girl has lived in the last several years being in the presence of God.  I ask God almost every day to hug our Jessica and let her know that her daddy will never forget her.  I know that I spend more time in my blog bragging and talking about the children that are here on this earth as we know it but that does not mean that Jessica has left my mind or my thoughts.  Jessica is still very much a part of our family and even though she is not here to share in the scholastic achievements of her brothers and sisters we know that her spirit lives on forever and that we will see her again one day when the Lord calls us home.

       I had HOPED that I could use my new WiFi Sandisk 802.11b wireless card for wireless access while visiting the Hartsfield and George Bush International Airports.  Guess what folks....  NO access.  The night before I got on the plane I searched WiFi hot spots specifically for Hartsfield and there were four terminals that were advertised to have Wireless access for travelers.  The Laptop Zone was the only place in terminal B that had Internet access.  You had to pay 65 cents per minute to use their private cubicles with high speed Internet access.  The employees told me that while the airport might have advertised WiFi hot spots that they did not have them turned on.  Not only that but I discovered something even more irritating during my visit to the airports.  Once upon a time pay phones used to have data terminals which enabled you to plug in your laptop and use an analog modem to dial up AOL or whatever DUN account you have to check e-mail and surf the web.  In an effort to gouge the consumer for even MORE cash and to make it IMPOSSIBLE to gain access to the Internet the Airport management has had those taken out as well.  No more analog data ports on pay phones.  Isn't that special??  NOT.....  Then there is the issue of security.  According to marketing experts that follow technology sales WiFi sales has really exploded in the last 3 to 4 years.  Hardware manufacturers are mass producing Wireless Access points for home users that they can use by simply taking it out of the box, turning it on and making very few changes on the home computer and be communicating via wireless.  The problem with that is that the hardware is defaulted to NO security out of the box.  The end user is supposed to figure out HOW to implement the security themselves.  I remember how hard it was for me to get my laptop on wireless access at the coffee shop in Mount Pleasant not too long ago.  I have 15 years of experience with installing network access points, servers etc.  It took me 30 minutes to gain access to the wireless network.  I wonder how long it would have taken your typical end user?  Would they have fought with the wireless connection with the same tenacity as I or would they have just given up after 10 minutes?    Wireless access is maturing and the hardware manufacturers have figured out how to churn out wireless access devices and the wireless network cards but no one has come up with a technology solution that will make it easy for a typical end user to log on to the wireless network (less than 20 minutes of fighting with configuration settings) and to have a basic set of security protocols in place that will allow paying customers access and other folks (war drivers or hackers) would be kept out.  Until they come up with a seamless and easy solution public WiFi access will only be achieved by those folks that are in the know and are willing to fight with the settings.   When I was at the George Bush Intl airport in Houston on my way back I noticed two kiosks that were set up at our gate that allowed you to sit down and get access via the High Speed terminal for .25 cents per minute.  The Kiosk that I looked had a folding keyboard that folded down with a touch pad for the mouse.  The video monitor that was in the kiosk was at an angle and partially hidden from view from the user which really stank.  I guess .25 cents per minute is better than .65 any day of the week.  So, lets see if you are there for 30 minutes you would owe 7.50 to check your email and surf the web.  I do not know about you but that is absolutely and incredibly ridiculous.  I wonder how much money the airports are really making on these kiosks?  Most of the people that I saw with laptops running were not getting near those cash cows.  I would also imagine that the people paying .65 cents per minute in laptop zone were probably business people that had expense accounts that would allow them to recoup that expense too.    So, now I have a wireless card for my Pocket PC and my laptop.  The only way I am going to be able to use it is for me to go wireless here at home which would include another 50.00 expense for a wireless router/switch/firewall.  Maybe some day I will be able to afford that.  The IT coordinator at Goodwill told me that he has a wireless switch that is thinking about enabling so I might be able to use wireless at work soon.  We shall see....

       Ok, it has been 4 days since I went on my proverbial jaunt through the neighborhood.  Despite my feeling like I have jello sloshing around in my noggin I invited my children to go with me for a walk this morning.  Kristina has blisters from tight fitting skates so she bowed out but Justin went with me.  I could tell that I had not walked for four days so this walk was a little bit harder than usual.  I wish I had half the energy that Justin has.  I kept having to tell him to slow down.  LOL...  There is nothing like connecting with your children duing moments like this.  Justin told me he was looking forward to camp Happy Days.  One week of fun filled excitement for the kids.  What a blessing that is going to be.

       I have been using Webshots for years. I remember when I actually PAID for a subscription so I could get all of their photos on a CD rom.  Then webshots went to having people PAY AGAIN for downloading more than one photo at a time for their desktop.  That sort of irritated me and all efforts to communicate that I felt I was a charter member that had ALREADY paid fell on deaf ears.  I suppose that they figured I would either pay again or shut up.  I chose the later and because their photos are VERY good I decided that I could live with downloading one picture a day.    Today I was surfing their site and remembered that I have the ability to share a photo album with friends and family via the FREE account that you can subscribe to.  I think that you are limited to the number of photos you can upload and then if you want to share more you have to (you guessed it) PAY for a subscription.  LOL.... No, nothing is free anymore folks.    The link to the Webshots community website is  urlLink Go here to sign up for free account and create your album  Once you do that and you upload some of your favorite photos (hint hint)  then invite me to visit your photo album and use moffittj@bellsouth.net.  Once that is done I can add you as a favorite member and when you upload new photos I can view them.    The alternative to this is HELLO which I posted in any earlier article in my blog (here) and you can BLOG your photos directly to your BLOG.  Of course that means that you would have to CREATE a blog account (Free) on www.blogger.com and then you can use HELLO to publish pictures directly to your blog and share them that way.    So, anyway, I am hoping that you, my friends and family will use one of these methods to share some photos online with me.  :)    Thanks

       Well, it was more like  a crash landing from the way I feel.  I think that I managed to pick up some sort of foreign pathogen of some sort and now my immune system has turned up the HEAT to combat it.  I thought at first it was a bad allergy reaction but I don't think you normally get a temperature with an allergy.  Well, atleast that is what Doctor Mom diagnosed a few moments ago.  If I want to get further clarification I could go down to Doctors Care on Rivers Avenue and let them verify that I DO have a fever and that I am sick.  How much would that cost me and would I feel better after I paid them $$$$ to tell me something I already know.  LOL... NOT  It IS good to be home even if I do feel like I was in a train wreck.  Hey, that reminds me of the movie where this actor seemed to always cheat death.  What WAS the name of that movie.  I think he DID survive a train wreck and several other catastrophes.  Hummmmmm.... More on that rabbit later.  I am waiting for my ears to pop after spending 3 hours in a MD-88 going 540 mph between 33000 and 27000 feet.  They have not popped yet so when I eat a piece of my crumpet it sounds like a washing machine.  LOL....  This is almost as irritating as having your pupils dilated and not being able to focus on anything close up.  Heck, now that I think about it I still have a problem focusing on things close up.  What in the world is happening to me?    While I was gone to the BIG city of Houston Texas I hooked up with a friend and ex employer while I was there.  His name is James.  What a coincidence huh?  James told me about a remote control software called VNC.  You can download the server and viewer module for FREE.  If you are running XP or W2k allow it to start up as a System Service and then during the install process be sure to give it a hard password that only YOU will know. Now you are asking yourself, ok, so what, another piece of software to clutter up my registry right?  Uhmmmm it all depends.  Perhaps you might have the need to HELP your friends or family with some easy computer problems.  How many times has someone called you and said.  HELP...  My computer is doing thus and so or is not doing thus and so and then you find yourself in the middle of a two hour long help desk situation where you are trying to get your friend or family member to describe to you what is on their screen or to read the error message.  This program will SOLVE your support nightmares and allow you to remotely log in to their system with a user name and password that they set up and you can point and click and zoom around and fix the problem MUCH faster than if you had to take the aforementioned nightmare.  Interested yet?  Here is the link so click on it and try it out.   urlLink Real VNC Remote Control Software   I am SO happy to be out of the rental car and in one spot for once.  I think that all I did was DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE.  It is a good thing I had unlimited miles on the car.  It is too bad I did not have unlimited gas coupons to fill the thing up.  LOL...  I paid 1.82 per gallon for regular unleaded so that is not too awfully bad.  I was able to hang out with my friend James Michael and Tom Whitten on Thursday night and then James and I met up with Jeremy to watch Van Helsing and Day after Tomorrow.  Wow, can you say ACTION packed flicks.... LOL... Sensory over load folks.  My friend James told me that the next movie should be a prequel and it should be called Day before yesterday.  Oh my, I laughed pretty hard at that.    Last night after watching Day after Tomorrow James, Jeremy and yours truly zoomed (zoom zoom zoom) headed over to 22300 Hwy 249 where we linked up with the charter leadership of Jesus Connect.  Yes, I took pictures of John, Don, Reynold and his family but you will have to wait for the 35mm pics to be developed.  I will be sure to get a CD ROM in the deal so I can do picture blogging to my hearts content.  I found out that Don is getting married soon and that GOM (stands for grouchy old man) is still a grouchy old man.  He fun lovingly calls me GOMIT or Grouchy OLD man in training.  We started that years ago (over 10) and it seems to have stuck over the years.  First we went into a Mexican restaurant where we stuffed ourselves to over flowing and then we retired to Reynolds house where we consumed cold liquid refreshments on the HOT and HUMID back porch.  OH MY GOSH.  I am not sure which city is the most miserable right now.  It seems that I was landing in Houston when I got off the airplane and entered into the walkway this afternoon.   Well, that is enough for now.  Jeremy has graduated and will be going to Wharton College for one year (community college) and then he will be going on to North Texas University where he will major in English and music I believe.  I think he wants to teach band to youth.  Way to go Jeremy, I am proud of you !!!!  I cant wait to develop all the film I took this weekend.  Whatever you do as you enjoy your day off tomorrow (if you are) try to remember the PRICE that WAS and IS being paid for our freedom and the blood that has been spilled and will continued to be spilled so we can do just that.  Relax at home and not be bothered with having to fight on foreign soil somewhere.    God bless

       I bet Flash is thinking something entirely different at this point of the game aye??  Ya probably would like to postpone that circus for another 12 weeks if you could huh?   My children are bouncing off the walls with excitement. I think that Kristina has packed her bags atleast 10 times. I walked past her bedroom the other night and she and Justin were trying to figure out how to fit an elephant into this bag and still get it closed. I could almost see something wiggling inside it.  Maybe they put Sammy or Angel in the bag to see if they could smuggle them to camp.  As far as that goes I would LOVE to see SAMMY the loud mouthed MUTT go to camp and stay there as the mascot YEAR round.    Sammy must be in his TERRIBLE twos now because I have an urge to KILL him atleast once per day.  That is usually around 5 or 6 am every morning.  Stupid dog....  As I am typing this Lulu the komikozee (spelling) cat is throwing herself from the porch ledge up against the window by the stove because she wants to get in.  We just let her outside for crying out loud KITTY....  I might as well potty train her so we can skip the "let you outside and then let you back in " so she does not have to get brain damage by slinging her body against the outside of the glass window to get our attention.  Goofy cat...  Katy just approached the couch and spoke to Sammy in her best authoritative voice.  Sammy Moffitt, you need to go to your cage. Sammy knowing that he is not going to budge a muscle gave her the "but I am so cute and adorable puppy dog you really dont EXPECT me to go to that nasty cage tonight do you look".  Katy responded by begging the dog not to wake her up at 5 am in the morning and put the dogs head on a pillow and covered him with a blanket on the couch.  OH MY GOSH people.  Here is how I would have handled this.   (drum roll please...).  Stern look at dog from recliner where I am typing this saying, SAMMY MOFFITT get your BUTT in your cage right now....  If this did not ellicit an immediate response no matter what sort of look he gives me I would have calmly put my laptop on the table next to me and launched myself onto the couch and pinned the dog WWF style to the cushion.  Then I would have picked up the pooch and fun lovingly body slammed him into the cushions a couple of times to let him I know I mean business when I talk and then I would drag him to his cage and toss him into it.  LOL....  Its a good thing that I am worn out from the Pro FORM 545E elliptical trainer.  The only energy I have left is in my arms and fingers which allows me to type this madness.  LOL...

        Ok, I finally did it!!  I found a Pro-Form 545E elliptical trainer at Goodwill where I work and it cost me a whopping $4.99!!  I had something like this about 2 or 3 years ago when we lived in Bluffton and I paid a LOT more for it than this one.  The one I had in Bluffton was electrical and had more computerized workout programs and monitored my pulse etc.  This one has the arm motion for cross training and is self powered.  That works for me because the payment is PAID in FULL!!  It is a good thing I have been walking 1.6 miles several times per week because this gadget really gave me a workout in the short time I was on it.  Here are some of the measurements it gave me about my workout this evening.      30 minutes .88 miles 1.7 mph average speed 167.2 Calories burned 52.8 Fat calories burned     How many calories does it take to loose one pound you might ask....  Would you believe 2000 ??  LOL...  That is right folks.  You have to burn 2000 calories to loose one pound.  That also means that while you are burning calories you need to REDUCE your calorie intake and INCREASE your water intake by 8 glasses of water per day.    Ok, now I do not have an excuse about getting a workout.  I have this thing sitting in my kitchen right next to the refrigerator.  I have a choice.  Do I go to the refrigerator and EAT or do I climb on this thing and shed some of these unwanted pounds??  LOL... I can hear it now.  You have the elliptical trainer next to your refrigerator??  Is that sort of crazy?  Yes, actually it is.  Then again, we are VERY limited to space and it needs to be in this part of the house so I can turn the music up when I work out.

Linksys routers can't be sniffed at any more   Firmware upgrade for all   By  Fernando Cassia: Tuesday 08 June 2004, 07:00       PERHAPS HURRIED by our recent report about the  BOOTP based exploit and sniffing vulnerability    in popular Linksys routers like the  BEFSR11  and  BEFSR41 , the firm has released  firmware version 1.45.11 , dated June 4, that specifically mentions  closing  the  BOOTP and memory leak hole which allowed remote sniffing of TCP/IP traffic passing through the devices   .   Here is a quick list of fixes, straight from the release notes:    Fixed CGI string attacks issue  Fixed UPnP on Windows XP SP2 issue  Fixed One way audio issue  Fixed NAT-T issue for some VPN connection  Fixed DHCP server revision, fill the siaddr to the server address  Fixed DHCP (BOOTP) vulnerability issue  Added Filter IDENT(port 113) to appear stealth when scanned  Added DHCP option 55 support  Fixed buffer leakage bug  Modified TCP Support RFC 3360 standard  Modified PPPoE/L2TP/PPTP fragmentation supports fragmenting 1 packet into more than 3.  Modified MTU/MRU function for better handling [of what?]  Owners of old revisions of the BEFSR41, BEFSR11 and BEFSRU31 routers, those made before the Cisco acquisition, will be happy to learn that this firmware was released for "Version 1" and "Version 2" hardware.      If you go to this link you can find the FIRMWARE upgrade for both of these routers at   urlLink Firmware upgrades for the BEFSR11 & BEFSR41 Routers ONLY....   WARNING: Do NOT do this if you are NOT POSITIVE about what VERSION of HARDWARE your Router is.  The hardware version can be found on the bottom of the router next to the model number.  If the version number (V2) is not there then it is assumed that it is V1.  :)

         Here I sit at the County Auditors office watching security monitors and the ebb and flow of humanity all around me.  Atleast I am spending my ten hour shift in front of a desk with Internet access and cold AC blowing on me.  Usually when I work the 3 pm  to 11pm shift at the Annex building there is NO air conditioning and I have to put up with the heat and humidity.  Hopefully the maintenance folks will be kind to us and install a temporary window unit where the security scans folks for weapons before they go up to the Treasurers office.  You are probably wondering WHY we do not have air conditioning in a government facility.  The reason for this is because the OT Wallace building has been under construction for the last 12 months or longer.  I am hopeful that in the next week or two that a temporary window AC unit will magically appear and we will feel some relief from the heat and humidity.  We have been experiencing low to mid 90's and even the upper 90's on some days.       I added a Site Manager counter/tracker functionality at the bottom of my blog so that I can start tracking how many folks are visiting my Blog.  I guess it would be nice to know how many hits I am getting and from whom.  This site manager is free and offers basic tracking which is just fine for me.  I also set up the ability to do Audio Blogging.  This enables me to call a number with my cell phone and leave an audio message for my reading/listening audience.  That means that if I chose to serenade you that I can.  LOL....  Ok, I promise that I will not do a LOT of singing as I realize that it will cause what little readership that I do have currently to scamper away at a high rate of speed.  LOL....       Thanks to Goggle I can publish in multiple formats to my blog.  I can type my weblog out so you can read it OR I can post pictures for you to SEE or I can talk to you from the depths of cyberspace from my cell phone.  It is a GOOD thing that my cell phone has FREE long distance.  The only thing that i did not really care about is that a web browser pops up and forces you to listen to the mp3 file by clicking on a play button.  I set up Winamp as my default media player which includes mp3 and was hoping that when I clicked on the audio blog that winamp would take over and play the media file.  It was a nice thought but I guess since the mp3 file is located on an HTTP Web server that the website forces you to download the file BEFORE you can do anything with it.     WHAT will they come up with next ??

       I ALWAYS read multiple Lockergnome RSS feeds BECAUSE of the cutting edge technology news and information. I know that some of you that read my BLOG do the same for the same reasons.  Good for you!!  You will be ahead of the game because of the knowledge you are going to glean from this resource.  Below I cut and pasted the paragrapy about SOS Crash Recovery.  I am going to check this out and hopefully you will do the same.      Every Lockergnomie needs SOS Crash Recovery! SOS can fully restore your system without requiring reinstallation of all your original software or the operating system! Just boot up from the SOS command or program, recover the SOS image backup and presto - everything is back exactly as you like it! SOS will not affect the performance of your system. Fully restore a crashed system in 15-30 minutes. SOS goes way beyond the System Restore tool included with Windows XP, which requires an active session of Windows in order to accomplish the System Restore process. SOS can work from Windows or from DOS mode if Windows cannot boot or function properly. SOS can even store the disk image on another drive or DVD for additional safety in the event of a crash or mechanical failure of the primary drive. SOS will also remember your software and put it back the way it was before the crash. If you have valuable data, you can save yourself from a huge amount of work after a crash. This product can truly save the day. With the proliferation of so many viruses, the potential for disk crashes has increased. You really need an inexpensive and quick way to restore your PC, apps, and valuable data. SOS is a great solution!

       I found this article while catching up on my RSS feeds this morning.  I too have been slightly miffed at the fact that when I am at work at Goodwill that I can not log on to my SMTP servers at Jesus Connect or Bellsouth to SEND out e-mail but rather have been forced to use gmail which is a web based provider for Google.  For those of you that are not bloggers and did not get an invitation to use gmail you are forced to use one of the other many web based email clients.  I for one am a fan of Outlook 2003 which is a very nice PIM (personal information manager) which allows me to synchronize my data in Outlook with my Pocket PC.  Webmail just will NOT do this.  The other thing that literally sucks is that if their server goes down, guess what, you are out of luck.  Your email account and all your email is cyber dust until they restore the server.  Well, anyway, you get the jist.  There are advantages to webmail and disadvantages.  That is why I choose to use both.  This is an excellent story btw.  _____  ISPs Blocking Port 25 To Curb Spam Hurts The Honest Guy Posted by Ed Hansberry @ 03:00 PM   This morning I woke up, logged into my laptop and started taking care of a number of emails in my various accounts. I have one work account and 4 personal accounts. Three of those personal accounts are using other SMTP servers, including my Pocket PC Thoughts account. Do do this, you need access to port 25. Why are ISPs blocking these? Because of ignorant people. They never run Windows Update, they installed a virus scanner in 2001 and haven't run a single update and click on every attachment in their inbox. Their computers are zombies sending out hundreds of millions of emails a day. Comcast admits "We're the biggest spammer on the Internet" because of these users.  Did Bellsouth.net, my ISP, warn me? Did they send out and email telling me port 25 would no longer be available? No! (Please note: the rest of this post can best be appreciated it you print it off and read it while storming around the room, occasionally giving a stilted kick or two at nothing in particular, and, of course, a bit of spittle can't hurt either.) So after about 30 minutes of figuring out why most of my emails weren't sending through various accounts and 3 different email clients, it dawned on me that port 25 was probably blocked. I called their customer service department and after getting bounced around to 4 people, I finally got someone that knew what was going on. "Yup. 25 has been blocked and we aren't unblocking it for anyone. Period."  AAARGGGHHH!!! I've been with them nearly three years and they took away my ability to send emails through my other email servers. I have a laptop and can't reconfigure all of my accounts to send through their servers because when I am on the road or connected through another network, their email server is unavailable to me. They allow no external access to their SMTP server. Idiots. So, the solution to the spam problem cause by a few ignorant people with zombie machines and the occasional intentional spammer is to block everyone?!? What IT genius at Bellsouth.net's made this decision? And who's decision was it to not open that port back up for customers that need it and haven't been accused of spamming?  With this logic, I can also fix the prostitution problem. Let's just block driving up and down the roads ladies of the evening hang out at. Never mind the thousands of drivers that use those same roads daily for legitimate reasons. For those few offenders, we'll inconvenience everyone.    I do have a potential alternative that many don't. I could theoretically always VPN into my corporate LAN and send through there, but there is one small problem, and I am not going to beat around the bush on this. Connection Manager for the Pocket PC sucks! It has been broken since Pocket PC 2002 and is still broken in Pocket PC 2003 SE. You cannot VPN into a LAN and send "internet" traffic through that connection unless you have a Proxy Server installed, so this solution would be for my laptop only and on my wireless LAN, that just isn't good enough.  So now I have an $80/month business account, which does open port 25, instead of a $47/month home account.  Totally insane. All because of some knee-jerk reaction to a valid problem solved with wrong-headed thinking, and as far as computing goes, that is the most evil thing that can happen. And in dealing with evil, Jules may said it best:

       For ten weeks I will be bowling in an ABC Mixed league consisting of a 5 person team.  I bowled a 172 average tonight which REALLY suprised me AND my teamates. LOL...  I bowled a 194, 186 and 136.  If I had bowled 7 more pins on my first game I would have gotten a patch.  Darn it!!  I blew it in my tenth frame that game.  Oh well, I have ten more weeks to accumulate some patches from ABC.  READY, SET, GO!!!!  I did not climb onto the beloved (TM) torture machine tonight BUT I did get a work out at the bowling alley so that will be my exercise today.  I am reminded of this because my body is sending multiple signals to my brain whining about aches and pains and being sore.  Tylenol PM is my friend though and before you know it I will be sound asleep and those signals going to my brain will be lost forever in a wave of snoring.   What can I say ?  Better living through chemicals.  LOL  Have you ever seen the commercials where the mild manner Clark type person gets into his or her car and turns into the Tazmanian devil?  We have all witnessed these idiots out racing around and making our lives perilous as they zoom up to your bumper and cut you off in traffic by yanking their vehicles in front of you without using a turn signal or waiting to see IF you will let them over.  I think the same thing happens to retail customers.  We get out of our cars, walk into the store and become a different animal alltogther.  I know this because four days a week I deal with psycho customers myself.  Yes, I know, I have been on the other side of the fence and I know how frustrating it can be to be the victim of NO customer service.  However, tonight we will focus on pscyho customers for a moment.   I am focused on these types of people tonight because Katy had a VERY bad day at Wallyworld (aka Wallmart) and came home in tears.  If Katy came home in tears it was because multiple people were JERKS towards her.  It takes a LOT to make her cry let me tell ya.  I told her she needs to buy a nurf baseball bat and when people are jerks to whack them upside their noggins for being stupid and insensitive.  Luckily for me Katy does not have my termperment and wont do that and lose her job.   The moral of the story is this.  Life goes on whether you are a jerk or not.  Just remember that there is a human being that is wearing the respective uniform or name tag of the particular establishment you are visiting.  People are doing just like you, going to work, performing specific tasks so that they too can get a paycheck, pay the bills and experience a certain level of comfort and enjoyment out of life.  They say that what goes around comes around.  So, before you use your tongue and attitude like a double edged sword to dice up the customer service representative tomorrow ask yourself HOW you would like to be treated IF you were on the other side of the isle, counter or telephone.  Ok, so you are asking me the question "what IF the customer service rep or sales associate is being a snot and treating me like dirt?"  Does that give me the right to tear them apart?  Most of you would say absolutely yes.  I would say that there is an exception to every rule and I also know that every company has a level of management in place that will deal with rude, arrogant and unruly employees very quickly because they want you to be happy and come back to spend MORE of your money in the near future.  So, with that in mind understand that I too have been on both sides of the fence.  Try to keep a level head and for crying out loud dont take your days frustrations out on someone just like yourself.  OK??

I was so excited to be able to talk to Jeremy online.  We shared pictures and spoke about different things.  I also found out that Jeremy has a blog and so now I can keep up with what is going on as he writes in his blog.    You may be wondering what Hello is.  Hello is a chat client that allows you to share pictures with friends and chat at the same time.  You can find this client at  urlLink Share pictures with friends and family and chat at the same time

       As I was surfing around doing this and that last night around 11:30 pm I noticed that my Norton Anti Virus Auto Protect icon was missing out of my system tray.  Now that I think about it I dont think I remember seeing it for quite some time.  This prompted me to open up Norton Anti Virus , check the settings and run Live Update.  What to my wandering eyes appeared but some RED check marks in the Status pane telling me of potential problems.  Not only was Auto Protect turned off but I could not turn it on.  I also could not turn on the e-mail protection.  This caused considerable alarm which in turn caused me to spend almost 2 hours scanning all my drives and then uninstalling and reinstalling Norton Anti Virus.  At 2:15 am Norton is installed and the virus database updated and all the correct options are running as selected with no problems.  I can now lay me down to sleep knowing that my computer is protected from the miscreants out in cyberworlds unknown.   Remember to run Live Update often and scan your drive.  Also be sure to have your Anti Virus software scan all incoming and outgoing e-mail messages.    Nite Nite

       I posted this message to a Health and Wellness Accountability group on Battle Plan Ministries and thought I would share it with you.    Hello Godly men!!    The last time I reported it was the 17th which was last Thursday. I got on the TM (torture machine) on Saturday the 19th and then this Wed which was the 23rd. I got on tonight for 22 minutes. I recently started a Friday night bowling league that will last 10 weeks so that will be my exercise for that night. I am trying to get on the TM every other day for atleast 20 to 25 minutes. So far I have stuck with that schedule but I must say that it is not easy.   I know that the goal for most of us is to loose pounds and inches and our satisfaction comes from watching the needle or digits on our bathroom scales go lower. I too get some satisfaction from this but I also get the satisfaction of knowing that I have set a goal to lose weight and to feel better. I have set the standard several notches higher than I have in the past and I feel good knowing that I am atleast trying and having a certain level of success. My pants are starting to fit looser around the gut and just the other day I had to chase down a customer who had already made it to the parking lot. I guess you could say that the "jog" from the service department where I work and the parking lot is about 250 FT. I surprised myself by actually breaking into a jog and making it to the parking lot before the lady left. What was surprising is that no one had to perform CPR or call 911 and I was not out of breath nor did I break into a sweat. I had to be proud of that because it shows me that there are small and large benefits to making an extra effort in this area of my life. No, I have not arrived and I do have a ways to go. The important thing is not that I have reached my long term goal which is to lose 100 lbs. but rather that I am meeting my short term goals every day which are to eat less, get enough sleep and exercise a minimum of 20 to 25 minutes aerobically every other day.   Lets bring this into perspective for those of you that are struggling with the exercise part.  I weigh approximately 335 lbs and am 6 foot tall. So, with that in mind please do not think that it is easy for me to climb on the torture machine and run along for 25 minutes. To the contrary folks. I have found that the first 8 to 10 minutes (on the lowest setting) is not that much of a challenge while I am working up to the 120 beats per minute goal for the workout. The last 10 to 15 minutes are what is tough when my leg muscles are begging for oxygen and for me to stop. When it gets to that part of the workout it would be SO EASY to quit. Instead of quitting I listen to up beat Christian contemporary music and I worry about getting through the current song that is playing. Most songs take between 2:30 and 4 min. to play. So halfway through my workout and to the very end when I start to slow down and cool off I literally have to take it one song at a time. I quote Phillipians 4:13 alot too. hahahahah I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.   I am also increasing my intake of water and decreasing my intake of soda pop. I drink approximately 3 to 4 20 ounce bottles of water per day. Imagine the extra exercise I get during the day running to the potty. LOL...  I know that brother Bill and Dave have posted recently but what about the rest of you guys?  How can we encourage you to get off that couch or chair or bed and start burning some calories each day by working out??

      A friend of mine sent me this in e-mail and I thought it was worth sharing on my blog.  LOL.   Author: Daniel Meyer    I never dreamed slowly cruising on my motorcycle through a residential neighborhood could be so incredibly dangerous! Little did I suspect ..I was on Brice Street - a very nice neighborhood with perfect lawns and slow traffic. As I passed an oncoming car, a brown furry missile shot out from under it and tumbled to a stop immediately in front of me.  It was a squirrel, and must have been trying to run across the road when it encountered the car. I really was not going very fast, but there was no time to brake or avoid it -- it was that close. I hate to run over animals, and I really hate it on a motorcycle, but a squirrel should pose no danger to me. I barely had time to brace for the impact. Animal lovers, never fear. Squirrels, I discovered, can take care of themselves!  Inches before impact, the squirrel flipped to his feet. He was standing on his hind legs and facing my oncoming Valkyrie with steadfast resolve in his little beady eyes. His mouth opened, and at the last possible second, he screamed and leapt! I am pretty sure the scream was squirrel for, "Bonzai!" or maybe, "Die you gravy-sucking, heathen scum!" The leap was nothing short of spectacular ... as he shot straight up, flew over my windshield, and impacted me squarely in the chest. Instantly, he set upon me. If I did not know better, I would have sworn he brought 20 of his little buddies along for the attack. Snarling, hissing, and tearing at my clothes, he was a frenzy of activity. As I was dressed only in a light T-shirt, summer riding gloves, and jeans this was a bit of a cause for concern. This furry little tornado was doing some damage! Picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and leather gloves, puttering at maybe 25 mph down a quiet residential street, and in the fight of his life with a squirrel. And losing...  I grabbed for him with my left hand. After a few misses, I finally managed to snag his tail. With all my strength, I flung the evil rodent off to the left of the bike, almost running into the right curb as I recoiled from the throw. That should have done it. The matter should have ended right there. It really should have. The squirrel could have sailed into one of the pristinely kept yards and gone on about his business, and I could have headed home. No one would have been the wiser. But this was no ordinary squirrel. This was not even an ordinary angry squirrel. This was an EVIL MUTANT ATTACK SQUIRREL OF DEATH! Somehow he caught my gloved finger with one of his little hands and, with the force of the throw, swung around and with a resounding thump and an amazing impact, he landed squarely on my back and resumed his rather antisocial and extremely distracting activities. He also managed to take my left glove with him!  The situation was not improved. Not improved at all. His attacks were continuing, and now I could not reach him. I was startled, to say the least. The combination of the force of the throw, only having one hand (the throttle hand) on the handlebars, and my jerking back unfortunately put a healthy twist through my right hand and into the throttle. A healthy twist on the throttle of a Valkyrie can only have one result. Torque. This is what the Valkyrie is made for, and she is very, very good at it.  The engine roared and the front wheel left the pavement. The squirrel screamed in anger. The Valkyrie screamed in ecstasy. I screamed in .. well .. I just plain screamed.  Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a slightly squirrel-torn-t-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, and roaring at maybe 50 mph and rapidly accelerating down a quiet residential street on one wheel, with a demonic squirrel on his back. The man and the squirrel are both screaming bloody murder. With the sudden acceleration I was forced to put my other hand back on the handlebars and try to get control of the bike. This was leaving the mutant squirrel to his own devices, but I really did not want to crash into somebody's tree, house, or parked car. Also, I had not yet figured out how to release the throttle.. my brain was just simply overloaded.  I did manage to mash the back brake, but it had little effect against the massive power of the big cruiser. About this time the squirrel decided that I was not paying sufficient attention to this very serious battle (maybe he was an evil mutant NAZI attack squirrel of death), and he came around my neck and got INSIDE my full-face helmet with me. As the faceplate closed part way, he began hissing in my face. I am quite sure my screaming changed intensity. It had little effect on the squirrel, however. The RPMs on the Dragon maxed out (since I was not bothering with shifting at the moment), so her front end started to drop. Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a very raggedly torn T-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, roaring at probably 80 mph, still on one wheel, with a large puffy squirrel's tail sticking out of the mostly closed full-face helmet. By now the screams are probably getting a little hoarse. Finally I got the upper hand ... I managed to grab his tail again, pulled him out of my helmet, and slung him to the left as hard as I could. This time it worked ... sort-of. Spectacularly sort-of .so to speak.  Picture a new scene. You are a cop. You and your partner have pulled off on a quiet residential street and parked with your windows down to do some paperwork. Suddenly a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a torn T-shirt flapping in the breeze, and wearing only one leather glove, moving at probably 80 mph on one wheel, and screaming bloody murder roars by, and with all his strength throws a live squirrel grenade directly into your police car. I heard screams.  They weren't mine...  I managed to get the big motorcycle under control and dropped the front wheel to the ground. I then used maximum braking and skidded to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke at the stop sign of a busy cross street. I would have returned to 'fess up (and to get my glove back). I really would have. Really...  Except for two things.  First, the cops did not seem interested or the slightest bit concerned about me at the moment. When I looked back, the doors on both sides of the patrol car were flung wide open. The cop from the passenger side was on his back, doing a crab walk into somebody's front yard, quickly moving away from the car.  The cop who had been in the driver's seat was standing in the street, aiming a riot shotgun at his own police car.  So, the cops were not interested in me. They often insist to "let the professionals handle it" anyway. That was one thing. The other? Well, I could clearly see shredded and flying pieces of foam and upholstery from the back seat. But I could also swear I saw the squirrel in the back window, shaking his little fist at me. That is one dangerous squirrel. And now he has a patrol car. A somewhat shredded patrol car ... but it was all his.  I took a deep breath, turned on my turn-signal, made a gentle right turn off of Brice Street, and sedately left the neighborhood. I decided it was best to just buy myself a new pair of gloves...and a whole lot of Band-Aids.

        My day started out at 9 am as I drove downtown to park in the Charleston County Parking Garage.  I showed up at the Federal Court House at 9:50 am for Jury Selection.  The courtroom was packed and they picked jurors for 5 cases, three civil and two criminal.  The first three cases involved theft of service from a major cable company and because of my computer/electronics experience I was not to be picked.  The two criminal cases involved weapons charges through ATF and other assorted federal agencies.  The prosecution picked me as a juror twice but for some strange reason the defense excused me as a juror.  Hummmm....  Actually, I can not afford to miss one single day of work at my regular jobs so that was good I was not picked.  Hopefully I wont be bothered now for a year or two to do this all over again.    I started my work day at 1 pm and worked until 11:15 pm when the zombie squad finally showed up to babysit an empty building and parking garage.  Hey, better them than me...   Well, that is about it for now, time to stuff my face and hit the sack folks.  Nite Nite...

       Beware lest you begin to download what you think is a valid piece of software from Kazaa or any other P2P (peer to peer) file sharing network.  Here is how it works.  Peer to Peer networks such as Kazaa allows you to register on their service and then network yourself with others with similar interests to download all sorts of software.  This software ranges from music files (mp3's etc) , software titles (usually pirated or hacked), movies (usually pirated or hacked) etc.  I know that this is not an all inclusive list but it seems that movies , computer software and music are at the top of the list.  What happens is you are downloading what you think is a movie when in all actuality you might get an advertisement for goods and services and if you are really unlucky you might be the winner of a nasty worm, trojan horse or virus of some sort that will be more than happy to email itself out to everyone in your windows address book (.wab file) not to mention possibly destroying data and infecting your registry so that it can respawn itself every time you reboot your computer.  Doing this with your computer and your data is like walking through a minefield without taking the time to look for the mines.  If you step in the wrong spot you will get your toes blown off.  The last time I checked most of us like our toes (or computer data) and it is painful to lose them.    Here are some simple rules for computing safely not only for yourself and your data but also to be a responsible netizen.     A. Do not use hacked software B. Always have your anti virus software updated on a regular basis C. Most anti virus software has Live Update that works automatically in the background, you set it and forget it D. Backup your data on a REGULAR basis.   E. Have multiple backup media for redundancy (IE separate hard disk and CDR or cdrw or external usb hard drive) F. Always configure your anti virus software to monitor both outgoing and incoming email G. When forwarding e-mail please do not forward every e-mail address from the multiple forwards that you received  H. Most folks dont like attachments when they are not expecting them so try not to send forwarded email as an attachment.   I. Stay FAR away from P2P file sharing networks.   J. If you have a broandband connection that stays on all the time PLEASE purchase a switch/router/firewall to provide an extra level of protection between you and the outside Internet.  Do not be fooled into thinking that the built in software firewall that comes with XP will be the end all solution to all of your security needs.   K. If your computer came with a System Recovery CD be SURE to lock that baby in a safe place. This CD will restore your computer back to its factory defaults and contains all the drivers for the hardware on your system.  L.  Atleast once per month run Windows Update and allow the Microsoft site scan your computer and tell you what critical updates are available.  ALWAYS read what the update is and if it is listed as critical and it FIXES a security issue on the Operating System be SURE to do it without fail.      Ok, that is not an all inclusive list but it contains some very basic common sense things that sometimes folks just forget or take for granted.  Now, lets assume that you are the unlucky soul that gets caught with your cyberpants down around your ankles.  You just made a boo boo and all of a sudden your computer is rebooting itself or you notice that your outbox on your email client is busy and you did not intend to send out an email to everyone in your address book.   The FIRST thing you should do is to reach behind your computer and remove the modem line (telephone wire) or your ethernet cable (that runs to your DSL or Cable modem).  Why is that you ask?  This will disconnect your computer from the LAN (local area network) internally and the Internet (Wide area network) externally.  That means that your computer is infected but will not be able to pass the infection on to other people (computers) on your local network  or external computer users on the Internet (like ME)....    The SECOND thing you should do is turn your computer OFF and go find the Anti Virus Rescue disks that you created when you first installed your anti virus software.  If you have not done that PLEASE go do that right after you read this.  It WILL save your bacon in the future.  Here is something that you might not know.  Not only do you need to do regular backups to different media you also need to recreate your Anti Virus rescue disks so that you can keep them up to date with the latest virus definitions.  If you installed McAfee or Norton Anti Virus 2 years ago but have not updated your rescue disks then the chances of your rescue disks being able to DETECT a new virus is slim to none.    Some of you are rolling your eyes right about now thinking "good grief do I REALLY need to do all of this stuff all the time??"  I bought this thing to surf the web and check email and the sales man told me that it would just work right out of the box.  No one told me about all of this.... The answer is YES.  Imagine if you bought a new car and drove it and drove it and never did any type of maintenance to it or changed the oil or put new tires or brake shoes on it.  How long would your car last ?  I can garuntee you it would not last anywhere near as long as it will if you take good care of it.  Over the years hardware and software manufacturers have made progress with regards to making computer products that are VERY user friendly and very automated.  However, ongoing maintenance has to be done or you will eventually run into problems.    When I first started writing this article I was going to just warn you about Peer to Peer networks and the inherent dangers of using them.  Once I started there then I started to remember some of the common sense things listed above that can help protect all of us.  This article is not intended to be a complete computer survival guide and there are so many other things that can be discussed in detail.  This goes without saying but I think I need to say it anyway.  If you do not know what you are doing and everything I am saying above seems to sound like greek find a family member or someone that you know that is computer savy and have them explain things to you in a way you will understand and help you to protect yourself better.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Well, anyway, you know what I am saying here.  It is better to be proactive than reactive.  When you get to the point that you are having to react to a disaster there will usually be some smoke and flames that will result in either data loss or some type of damage to your computer.  That is the last thing either of us want or need.  Am I right??

       Mondays are my day to rest.  Let me rephrase that.  Mondays is the day that I dont put on my gorrilla suit (security uniform) nor do I have to put up with retail customers.  All in all that is a GOOD thing.  Because I only have one day off I find myself doing all of my errands and chores and to do list in ONE DAY.    This morning at 2 am I finally went to sleep and woke up at around 6:45 am. I layed around in the recliner for a few moments and then decided to turn on the coffee pot and start my day by checking the e-mail inbox.  I climbed onto the Torture Machine for 25 minutes and then Katy and I went to visit our friend Patty as we hip hopped over to IHOP for breakfast.  Before I left this morning I located a freeware program "WiFiFoFum" for the PocketPC that will allow me to war drive.  In other words I can drive down the street and use my PocketPC and the wireless card to sniff out WiFi connections.  I was amazed at how many WiFi connections that I was able to find.  Nevertheless I was not able to make a good enough connection to an WAP so I could surf the Internet via the web browser or log on to MSN IM.  My friend Patty thinks that I need to read the read.me file that came with the software but sadly enough none was included.  Anyway, the bottom line is this.  I am still trying to figure out HOW to make an actual WiFi connection that will allow me to surf the web or check my e-mail.  I think that between my house and Patty's I ran across 30 signals.    I just had a phone call from a dear friend who is having computer problems so my entire train of thought is out the window. LOL.  Don't ya hate it when that happens.  Oh well, time to go help her get her computer glued back together.  I can always come back to this.

       Moffittcam is up and running...  If you use Yahoo IM and you want to see if you can catch me near the web cam then plug in moffittcam as a Yahoo IM id and if I am broadcasting you will see something.  Currently I am at work at the PC Repair shop here at Goodwill until 5:30 pm.    Later

      I was at work yesterday at Goodwill and this lady called on the phone.  I sold her a computer this last Saturday.  She said "Is the heavy set guy there that sold me the computer Saturday?" When I asked her to clarify who she was looking for (in what department) she apologized for describing that person (me) in that way but she did not get his name.  She told me that the heavy set guy sold her a computer. I finally confessed that I was the FAT BOY that sold her the computer.  LOL....  I get SO tired of people saying "Hey BIG Guy" and describing me as "Heavy Set".  Sometimes when a small person says "Hey Big Guy" I sometimes respond by saying "Hey Tiny Dude".  LOL.  I guess they get the point when I do that.  Good grief people just call me by my name or just dont speak to me at all.  Am I the only person that gets tired of being labled because I am a BIG GUY??  I get sick of shallow people who have nothing better to do than to highlight the fact that I am a FAT BOY....  When I get depressed  and/or ANGRY  I sometimes think  "oh what is the freaking use people???"  But, that emotion usually does not last that long and I just figure the truth hurts and get on with living.   ;)   This FAT BOY will be getting on the Cross Trainer this morning for 25 min before I meet a friend for breakfast and some war driving with my Ipaq.  Instead of being depressed and angry about the problem I am going to chose to do something about it one day at a time.   God bless

       A dear friend of mine sent me the following article which outlined their findings with regards to how easy it is to hack your way into a corporate network to steal data via their unsecured Wireless Access Point.  Here is the article. from Red-M which is a Wireless Security Company.      According to a report from global wireless security company Red-M, most global businesses are at risk because they have not secured their wireless infrastructures.   The six-month study of 100 companies across the globe, including large multinational corporations covering a range of industry sectors, found that 80 per cent of corporate networks are accessible from outside their buildings.   Two thirds of banks, 60 per cent of financial services institutions and all education institutions leaked data, the study claimed.   Karl W Feilder, chief executive at Red-M, said in a statement: "Most businesses have not yet grasped the fact that once there is any sort of wireless device on their premises - and today you have to presume there is at least one device in your company - it acts as a point of insecurity by broadcasting company information over the airwaves.  "Sitting in your parking lot up to 300ft away from your building with a laptop and an inexpensive piece of software, an outsider could easily see the information being freely broadcast.   "They could receive network traffic, and could wreak havoc by exposing confidential and sensitive company information and manipulating data."     This is my response to that report...  I will certainly concur that a LOT of businesses and home users have not grasped the concept Network security and data integrity.  The sad thing is that all they have to do is enable WEP and change the default admin ID and password on the Wireless Access Point (WAP).    From a technical point of view here are a couple of observations about the comments from the article you just sent me that was put together by Red-M.  There is a difference between individuals that represent a company that deals with Network Security Threats vs some Tom Dick or Harry user who is just out war driving.  People from Red-M are going to be security experts who understand how a computer network works and how to hack their way into company data.  In other words they know how to try and compromise Firewalls, Switches, Routers and then the company file servers to access data.  If they get through the first three devices listed above then perhaps they will be able to access the data on the file server.  This is assuming that the company in question has NO security enabled whatsoever on the file server or the internal routing devices listed above.  That would mean that they just plugged in these devices and left the default administrative passwords in place.  I realize that Network Administrators are over worked and under paid.  However, I can almost garuntee you that these same Network Administrators are painfully aware of the importance of data integrity and security and they are NOT going to put Firewalls, Routers and Switches in place without setting up security.  It is just not going to happen.  When it comes to their data depending on the type of network , peer to peer or client server, there is going to be authentication happening either at the SHARE level or DOMAIN level which means you will have to have a user name and password to gain access to the data.  That means that if the administrator id and password are difficult enough they will have to know a valid user id on the network and the password to get access to the data.  The chances of that happening from anyone just sitting out in the parking lot is going to be slim to none.   A wireless access point (WAP) acts just like a gateway to your internal network.  Before wireless came along employees of companies if they wanted access to a corporate network would either have to dial in to a corporate gateway (DUN Account) or tunnel in via pptp (point to point tunneling protocol) utilizing a user name and password to get on the network.  Once the user is logged onto the network you can still limit what resources they have access to on the LAN by limiting what they have access to via Share level access or Group level access on the domain.  So, just because a person can actually hack their way into a network does not mean that they have full access to everything on the file server.  They are still limited by the internal network security that is in place.   So, with all of that in mind I do not think that the security threat is as bad as the security industry would want us to imagine.  One reason they are yelling foul so loudly is because they want the companies in question to be aware of their need to lock down their networks AND they want these same companies to use their exertise (for a cost of course) to implement these measures.  Just changing the default user id and password on the WAP will make it exponentially difficult for someone to hack into the network.  If you do not have the user id and password you just simply will not gain access.    I also believe that their claims that you can sit in your car within 300 feet of the establishment and gain access to a corporate LAN and compromise their data security is a bit far fetched.  Just in my short experience with war driving I have found it difficult at best to even acquire and KEEP a wireless signal long enough to TRY to log on.  I was standing at the front door at the Mills House the other night and I was getting a signal strength of about 20% at the very best and that was not enough for me to get an IP address from their DHCP server much less try to logon to Thinkspots network.    There is a huge difference in being able to sniff out a wireless signal via war driving vs being able to authenticate to the data source and steal information as readily as they are saying you can.  In other words there is no mechanism in place where the file server is connecting to the WAP and transmitting corporate data out into the parking lot.  LOL....  You have to gain access through the front door (WAP), authenticate to the file server (network security) and then grab ahold of the data and tell it to be copied back out across the LAN to the WAP over the wireless signal to your laptop.

      I am currently at Just Fresh on Rivers Avenue in Charleston using their wireless network and enjoying a cup of coffee. I was able to successfully connect to the Thinkspot network with my Ipaq and send out several emails.  I was able to configure my Outlook software on the Ipaq to send and receive my Bellsouth.net emails.  I am not able to chat via MSN Messenger which is built into the Microsoft Mobile OS on the Ipaq which I find puzzling.  I will have to research that soon.  I am using the laptop to connect and send this blog before the battery on this thing dies.  :(  Well, I am happy that I FINALLY made that magical wireless connection with the Ipaq.  I also learned that while you can certainly war drive and walk and find stray wireless signals you have to find one that is STRONG enough to enable you to make the network connection and keep it or you will never make the trip successfully to the Internet.  That means that you need to be atleast within 50 feet of the front door of the establishment that is broadcasting a wireless signal if not inside to get a good enough signal.    Well, that is about it folks, hope you have a good evening and a good day tomorrow!!

       As usual I spent most of my day in the computer service department hiding from the retail customers tinkering on this and that.  My boss finally gave me the go ahead to configure a couple of machines for us to use in the shop which means I wont have to use the laptop anymore to get on the Internet and do my job.  OH YEAH!!  Go Goodwill , LOL....  I had a volunteer named Dave who came in to help all day Saturday which was nice.  Dave is sponsored through a program called Americorp which is the American alternative to Peace Corp which is International.  Dave told me that he lives in Michigan and that he spends a period of time traveling around the US doing volunteer work.  When he is finished he will have 5,000.00 put into a college fund.  Dave lives in Michigan and will be going home for the first time since Christmas of last year.  Dave was an EXCELLENT worker who helped me completely clean up the shop and many other things.  I found myself wishing that our work experience people were half as helpful as Dave was.  Oh well.....  On another unrelated note I found myself fighting with my Pocket PC , USB and MS Active Sync last night.  I could not get my Pocket PC (Ipaq) to synch with my computer.  They just would not connect.  Grrrrrr.  So, for an hour last night I kept rebooting my computer, switching USB ports, uninstalling and reinstalling the MS Active Synch software.  To no avail.  I finally thought "I wonder if I need to do a soft reset on my Ipaq to see if that will help".  Sure enough, did a soft reset on the Ipaq, plugged it into the cradle and it was a USB marriage made for success.  MS Active Synch did its thing and I am once again united with updated information from Outlook 2003.  Wahooooo....

        Hey, if I am going to dream, why not dream BIG.  How about dreaming the impossible??  LOL... Well, who knows, if we figure out how to play the lottery on a regular basis we will have a 1 in 5 million chance of hitting it big just like everyone else that plays.  Short of that happening this Christmas wish will probably remain a dream.  LOL...    I downloaded this image as my desktop this morning from Webshots.  If you are like me you do not like to stare at the same ole boring desktop day in and day out.  As for me, I use Webshots to refresh my desktop image every single day.    As you can see mother nature dumped buckets of water on us yesterday evening.  The storm was so bad Katy and I grabbed the dogs and headed for the center of our tin box.  Yes, living in a double wide trailer is NO FUN when you are listening to the lightning cracking all around you and watching debris fly by the windows when the wind kicks up a notch or two.  Living in the midst of a bunch of trees all around you also does not make things nice when the lightning starts to zing all around you.  I guess the only plus about the trees is that hopefully the bouncing electricity will hit one of them before it hits the trailer.  Then again, if it hits a tree close to us that tree will possibly land on top of our tin can causing a large dent.  All you can do is hide , squint and pucker and hope the storm passes by without killing you or the neighbors...        Katy just advised me that Justin and Kristina's neo pets were starving and that she had to go online to feed them.  I said "say do what??".  Katy is playing some sort of game on Neopets so that she can accumulate enough points to buy food for the neopets so they dont starve.  Gosh, I wonder if we can do that for the REST of the zoo around here?  LOL...  I am thinking, "dont we have enough critters to feed around here without having to have NEOPETS to tend to?"  @@  I guess it goes to show you that there are just not enough pets to go around....     My 18 year old son in Houston Texas (actually Richmond/Rosenburg Tx outside of Houston) started his first year of community college at Wharton University.  Wharton University is a community college close to where Jeremy lives with is mother and step father.  Mark, Jeremy's step father, has been working hard at making sure Jeremy got registered in college so now Jeremy can make the educational leap from High School into community college.  Way to GO Jeremy !!  Study hard son, you will reap the benefits of the hard work later on in life.  I was chatting with Jeremy just the other day on Hello telling him that I was hoping that he would NOT make the same mistake I did.  When I was his age I had the opportunity to get my RN degree at El Centro in Dallas Texas and because I THOUGHT I was smarter than my parents I decided that I would drop out (idiot) and be a real man and just make it on my own.  After all, my parents were incredibly short sighted and stupid and what did they know about real life?  Well anyway, there is more to that story than meets the casual observer here but the important lesson to be learned is to get that degree while you can.       I changed my imood this morning from blessed to SICK.  Yuck and double yuck.  My blood pressure spiked yesterday at work so I wound up coming home at 2pm to rest.  This morning I felt better in that regard but I spent most of the morning talking to mother nature.  I have been speaking with her so much this morning I feel as if I have a special relationship that will NEVER end.  I am hopeful that this ongoing conversation will eventually end.  I called my boss at Goodwill and told him of my predicament and that I would try to be at work by noon today but if not I will be there in the morning to greet all of our eager beaver retail shoppers as they rush through the door looking for used computer junk to carry home. (Cough)....   I am happy to announce that my friend John Searcy in Houston Texas wrote me an e-mail telling me that he has started a new blog.  John told me that something I said to him when we were all together for a JC reunion caused his creative juices to get flowing.  You can read his blog at  urlLink John Searcy Bloghttp://iamnotgod.blogspot.com /  You can read Jeremy's blog at  urlLink Jeremy Moffitt Bloghttp://germ_e.blogspot.com / as well.

      A fellow blogger that I found through an index called Blogs4God wrote the following.    "I'm convinced that my blog readership would increase greatly if I worked in a bar or a pornography establishment. Or, perhaps, if I were gay. It seems that sex and alcohol are the primo subjects to blog."    I tried to post my response to his comments section but I was too long winded to fit it all in there. So I told him to come here , to my blog , to read my comments in their entirety.     You are correct.  If you were posting comments from the viewpoint of the world then your readership would increase ten fold.  Then again we as Christians are not of this world.  We are different.  Atleast that is what my bible tells me. We have been redeemed and restored. We are to be the salt of the earth and light of the world.  We are not supposed to be like everyone else. We are supposed to bring flavor to those around us and we are to intrigue others because of our lifestyle choices.  Sometimes that intrigue turns out to be something that repels people instead of attracting them.  Nevertheless God uses who He is in us to reach out to the community that HE has placed us in.  We might think that we are just a common Joe with common lives that no one is interested in.  Take heart and know that people are watching and see the real you even when you are not watching.  When we gave our hearts to God and said "I will follow you" we rejected the things of this world and embraced the kingdom of God.  That means that the things of this world really do not have an appeal to us anymore.  Amen?  Do we really want to be a part of the worlds social scene any longer?  Of course not, those things are temporal and unfullfilling.  The reason for that is because there is very little value.  Gosh, I feel as if I am preaching here and that is not my intent.  I just want to encourage you to know that your life makes a huge difference in the grand scheme of things. You may not be in lights per say and your blog readership may be minimal.  Its not who we are or what we can accomplish or who can notice us but rather what God can do through us.  When we are weak and inadequate that is when HE can do his perfect work through us.  Keep on Keeping on for Christ my brother.           James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net

      It is hard to believe it is already Tuesday morning at 2:18 am.  I seem to remember that I just went to church and then went out to lunch and went to work 3 pm to 11 pm Sunday evening.  Then I went back to work at 7 am until 3pm on Monday morning. That was yesterday and here it is after 2 am in the morning on Tuesday.  It is a good thing that I dont have to go to work until 3 pm today.  Maybe Sammy the mutt will let us sleep past 4:30 am today.  Yesterday morning after going to bed at 1:30 am he went out to leave his mark on the neighborhood and when he came back inside he decided he would start barking at Angel to see if she would wake up and play with him.  That plan backfired on him because he wound up waking up the Boggy Creek Monster who came into Kristina's room and descended upon him in an attempt to change his mind with regards to barking at 4:30 am.  Apparently the Boggy Creek Monster likes to sleep undisturbed during that time of the day.  Sammy the mutt was unable to dodge the first two blows that bounced off his body but he did dive for cover next to Kristina who awakened and came to his defense in the nick of time.  The Boggy Creek Monster having made his point clear enough to Sammy the mutt retreated back to the creek and attempted to go back to sleep.    As we fast forward to around 8 pm last night you will note that I decided to make a run to Wallyworld to locate a TV antennae for our television.  We have not had cable TV now for about 2 months which also means that we were not getting local TV channels either.  That means that I have been several quarts low on Jay Leno monologue.  My trip to Wallyworld was productive in that I found an antennae and a DVD movie of interest and came back home to install said antennae.  I am not sure IF Jeff Foxworthy has a line in his book called "You must be a redneck if" with regards to TV antennas.  If not, I can happily add this one to his ever growing list.  You must be a redneck if you spend 20.00 on a TV antenna and the only way you can get it to work in your double wide trailer is to throw it outside on the porch.  LOL...  That is right.  This high powered antenna would get a signal but not much of one.  I figure that while the metal in the double wide trailer is not much with regards to keeping in the cool or keeping out the cold it certainly can keep out all matter of TV signals.  I guess that means that I dont have to worry about people sitting outside with parabolic mics listening in to our conversations.  In the past I tried this same manuver in an attempt to find a signal.  In my desperation the next step became the mother of my newest brain child which was to toss the stupid antenna outside.  That required a couple of extension cords and a 20 foot piece of cable and a splitter that allowed me to throw it out on the porch.  Lets not forget the special enhancement that I added when I wrapped a couple of pieces of aluminum foil to each rabbit ear.  That seemed to REALLY do the trick.

        I utilized my Ipaq to take notes this morning and I was touched by this morning's message by Doug Dickerson who filled in for our pastor Tom Glisson.  Doug Dickerson has preached at our church on several occasions and were happy to hear what God said through him this morning.    Doug picks up the sermon in Phillipians  chapter 3 verses 12-14 as the apostle Paul is speaking....  Grace Fellowship Church Sermon 7/11/04- Doug Dickerson  Phillipians 3:12-14   Phi 3:12  Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.  Phi 3:13  Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,  Phi 3:14  I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.   Are we preserving or progressing in the Lord with our relationship?  Preserving is maintaining Progressing is to move forward to the prize or pressing on  Are we content in living in what used to be?  Moving out of our comfort zone takes risk  God can not do anything new until we shake off the past and our comfort zone.  Do we place our comfort over commitment?  The tradition of the past hinders God from moving us into the future.  God does not change but we can be changed by God.  We can not be content in just our Godly heritage  We have not arrived.   There is always something new to experience and gain in our relationship with God.  Bad Attitude that hinders growth Yesterdays experience was sufficient and can not be exceeded.   We are dependent upon God today.  Spiritual pride keeps us from experiencing God in a new way. We should not live in the past and our accomplishments with God.    Preserving is a defensive hold on the past.  Progressive is moving toward the future.  The 7 deadliest words for a church = We never did it this way before...   Paul was passionate abut knowing Christ.  To move on with God we must become passionate about who God is and what He wants for us.  Fear of new things paralyzing us and keeping us from what God wants for us.  Fear paralyzes our dreams and hopes.  Lay down those (the)  sin(s) that so easily entangles us   Three challenges for us today.       Believe  that God wants to exceed our  expectations   To  keep our eyes on Jesus  and not our  circumstances   To  keep pressing on  towards  the goal  to win the prize

      Just today I sent out an e-mail to my "technology" distribution list and they wrote me back that according to their Anti Virus vendor that they were safe.  This was my response back to them in e-mail and I thought it would be good to post here as well.   Anti Virus protection is not "set it and forget it" anymore.  Hackers and script kiddies are writing viruses faster than Mcafee and Symantec can write patches for them.  Almost every computer that I get that comes into the pc repair shop that is infected with viruses are either running Norton Anti Virus or McAfee.  Granted, most of the time the end user who got infected got lazy and did not do live update or schedule it to be done for them on a regular basis.  A regular basis today is atleast twice per week.  I remember a time when once every 30 days was good enough.  Not anymore.   I use both Norton Anti Virus and AVG at the shop. I NEVER run one virus scan with one product and believe it. I always double check.  So, with that fact in mind dont get too comfy with the idea that your Anti Virus vendor is covering all the basis.  The time period between the time a virus is released into the wild and the time it takes your Anti Virus Vendor to cover its bases and send out an update to cover you could mean the difference between a virus infection and data loss not to mention lost time in putting your system back together after the damage is done.     Be vewy vewy careful....

I would hope that no one else is there and that I could make the bridge disappear so I could enjoy a few moments of solitude and relaxation.

        Oops , wrong movie...  That was lost in space.  The "Will" I am thinking about is Will Smith who plays in iRobot which is showing in theatres EVERYWHERE.....  No, I wont spoil it for you by telling you all about the robot called NS5.  I will say that Will Smith does a bang up job acting in this movie and you will find some surprises you will not expect.  The plot is fast moving, lots of mystery and intrigue and the special affects were pretty cool too.  In the year 2035 is when this movie is staged.  I wonder if technology will be that far advanced in 2035 and if so will I be alive to see it AND appreciate it.  If I live that long I will be 74 years old.  Justin, if you happen to be reading this do me a favor and get one of the cool cars that Will Smith was driving and give me a ride in it, will ya?  LOL...  On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this movie a 9.5  :)

       I found out that "Aunt Mickey" passed away at 5pm yesterday at the Methodist Hospital in Dallas Texas due to the complications of a massive stroke.  I am not sure how my aunt got named Aunt Mickey but it stuck and that is what most people called her.  Aunt Mickey was 71 years old and her death comes as a sudden suprise and blow to all that knew her.   Apparently my aunt had a smaller stroke about a week ago and was put on blood thinners. For some reason she missed a doctors appointment and then a day or two ago she started having some problems with falling etc.  My first cousin Larry found her on the floor of her home on Saturday and my first cousin Debbie found her yesterday.  An ambulance was called and she was transported to a hospital in Terrell Texas.  Doctors there had her life flighted by air ambulance to the Methodist Hospital where they discovered that she was hemorraghing in the brain.  Life support measures had to be implemented to keep Aunt Mickey alive and I guess around 5pm yesterday her husband "Uncle Carl" gave permission to remove life support.    Aunt Mickey, Uncle Carl and Aunt Beth were three of my favorite relatives.  I remember several summers as I was growing up where I would stay with my Aunt Mickey and Uncle Carl in Terrel Texas.  My aunts and uncles were always very gracious, kind and loving towards me and my sister Tanya.  I have many fond memories of my aunts and uncle.   Aunt Mickey loved to laugh and when she did you could hear her through the entire house.  Aunt Mickey had  a huge heart with tons of love to give everyone.  I remember how I used to get up at 4:30 am with my Uncle Carl during the summer and would have coffee and biscuits with butter and honey.  Then we would pile into his Chevy Silverado pick up truck and go off to one of the job sites.  Uncle Carl was a home builder in Terrell Texas.  Uncle Carl liked to go play golf too.  One of my fond memories of Uncle Carl was that he taught me how to drive.  My dad just did not have the patience to teach me how to drive so Uncle Carl would take me to the school parking lot and put me behind the wheel of his truck and let me drive.  Uncle Carl had the patience of Job and tirelessly taught me this and that when he had the time to do so.    I will never forget the day that my grandmother died.  Aunt Mickey could be heard crying through the entire house that day.  My grandmother passed away back in 1980 when I graduated from High School.  I remember helping Aunt Mickey take care of my grandmother when I was staying there during the summer vacations from school in Quinlan Texas.  I can remember how my grandmother loved the Lord and how she saved my sister and I from many a whuppin from my dad.  My grandmother would stand between my sister and I and my dad and tell him to back off.  If it had not been for her I would have gotten more whuppins than I did.  LOL...    Glenna Hickson is survived by her husband (my uncle) Carl Hickson and her daughter Debbie English and son Larry Hickson.  Debbie English lives in Kaufman Texas and Larry Hickson lives in Terrell Texas.  Glenna Hickson is also survived by my Aunt Beth aka Beth Aldridge who lives in Quinlan Texas.  Beth Aldridge is 81 years old and I have many fond memories of visiting her during my childhood.  Beth Aldridge is the last remaining sibling on my dads side of the family.  I know that I know that I know that I have forgotten lots of neices and nephews and other relatives that I have long since forgotten about.  When I get a copy of the obituary I will post it here so that you can read it.    I am hopeful that I can find a way to go to the funeral this week.  Arrangements are being made as I write this and I am thinking that they are planning to have it on Wed which means I have a LONG drive ahead of me.  I figured out it is 1100 miles or 17 hours one way.  Whew, that is a LOT of driving folks.    My Aunt Mickey was a believer in Jesus Christ so that means that she is in a much better place now than she was a week ago.  That also means that she will have an opportunity to see other family members who have gone on before her.  I love you Aunt Mickey, you will always be in my mind and heart.  Give our Jessica and your Doug and Randy a hug for me.   Love always, your nephew Jimmy Moffitt.....

       I had yesterday off from work after 9 days straight without a day off.  All was well until I managed to yank a kink into my back early in the morning after taking my daily shower. That was too much fun.  Pain, the final frontier, going where I certainly did not want to go.  However, that did not stop me from taking my friend Chuck to Cracker Barrell and stuffing my face with Grandpa's Country Fried Steak Breakfast.  Gosh, I am getting hungry just typing it.  How scary is that?  The pain in my back was making it difficult to breath but not too difficult to swallow so I endured the car ride there and back.  I spent most of my day running errands and then picked up my Gizmo from Sangaree Middle School and took her to McDonalds for lunch.  Once that was done we went back to the new school and Katy escorted me back to her classroom where I met her assistant who is ALSO named James.  What an interesting coincidence that is....  As you can already tell I snapped some digital images as well as some 35 mm shots.  You see the digital pics now on the blog and if I find some on the 35mm cd when I get them devoloped you will see those at a later date.  Gosh, I just love being a shutter bug.    Happy Nappy Time happened between 3:30 pm and 5 pm when I laid down to try and shake the pain which had begun to subside in my back.  I woke up around 5pm , had coffee and an oreo cookie or two or three or four.....  I then took Kristina over to the pastors house where the youth were meeting to head to a Summerville COGOP church for a back to school rally of some sort.  Justin and I headed over to Royal Z bowling alley where we bowled a practice game before the league games last night.  Our team, M&M BB's (who came up with that team name anyway??) was securely in 5th place and after winning ALL FOUR games last night we should be in fourth or 3rd place next week depending on how the top teams did or did not do.  I managed to bowl a 154 average last night which just tickles me green and orange which is the same color as my 15lb bowling ball.    After bowling was over Justin and I piled into the jalopy and headed over to Wallyworld to pick up a couple of items and see how Gizmo was holding up at her cash register.  This is back to school TAX FREE weekend so all the rednecks were stumbling over each other trying to figure out how many packages of numbe two pencils and Big Chief tablets to buy for their kiddos.  It was a sight to behold I tell ya...  While at Wallyworld we picked up a special edition copy of HellBoy.  Justin was so happy I thought he would pee his pants but luckily for me he did not do it.  Whew....  The kids and I stayed up until 1:33 am watching Hellboy and then we all piled off to bed for some quality snoring time.  It is now 2:44 am and I am banging on the keyboard thanks to my Happy Nappy Time yesterday afternoon and Katy is trying to get to sleep and by now the kids are probably snoring right along with the dogs and other assorted critters we have living here.    In hopes that the Sominex that I just took will kick in soon I am going to stop babbling here for the time being and head back to my pillow and see if I can get some quality drool time in.  You noticed I did not say "beauty sleep".  I gave up on that hope years ago.  Bwahahahahahahaha  Poor Gizmo...    Nite Nite

       I am happy to report that Katy has landed a long term substitute teaching position at a new school in Sangaree teaching ED kids.  Katy has a special love for ED kids and that is probably why she has been able to put up with me for the last 14 + years without killing me.  LOL..  Anyway, Katy called me up all smiles on the telephone when she found out that she was hired for the long term sub position.  This position will give her some more experience while she finishes out the process to become a full time teacher in the state of South Carolina.  I am sure Katy can give you a lot more information about what all this requires with regards to the process and the new school she will be teaching at.  Honey, do you feel a blog coming on or what?  LOL...  I am sitting here at work at the City Magistrate's office counting the minutes until time to get off which will be 5 pm or 1700 hours by the military clock.  In this office we have Small Claims Court and the place to file eviction notices with regards to real estate issues.  Can you imagine the stories that I hear coming through this place during the day?   Just yesterday I was looking out into the parking lot and a mother had decided to let her three juvenile sons out of the SUV so that they could practice tinkling on the fire hydrant at the edge of the property.  I guess they could not come inside and use the restroom like normal human beings....   I am thankful for the ability to write e-mails offline via my Pocket PC and be able to blog offline and then synchronize when I connect to the home network when I get home.  It gives me something to do when my eye lids begin to slam shut out of sheer boredom.  When I work downtown at the county office building there are all sorts of people to talk to and other security officers to interact with so you do not have to worry about getty sleepy.  Have you ever tried to stay awake for 8 hours with almost nothing to do to occupy your time?  Luckily for me the client does not mind my doing something to keep awake and semi alert.  That means I can read the paper and blog offline and write e-mails.  Wahooooo.  I actually read USA Today and The Post and Clueless from cover to cover this morning between 8:30 am and about noon.  Between 1200 and 1300 I ate the lunch that my sweet wife packed (minus a drink) and then it was back to sitting here wondering what to do next other than dozing off in my chair.  From time to time I go outside and stumble around in the stifling humidity filled air and then come back inside to enjoy the COLD AC inside the building I am at.    I can not wait to get into my red chariot and roll down the windows in this heat and drive home.  Luckily the drive home only takes 25 minutes but without AC in the jalopy it makes things miserable.  I admit, I am spoiled.  I want the AC unit blowing ice cubes on me when I am driving down the road.  My AC in my car, as you have probably already guessed, is not cooling squat.  I can not tell you how much that stinks considering we are only 5 days into August and I have another 45 to 60 dog days of summer left to endure.  Maybe I will get lucky and sweat off a couple of pounds in exchange for now AC....

       For the first time in a LONG time we went to bed before 11 pm which means that I woke up at 5:30 am as well.  I had my 7 hours of sleep and now I am wide eyed and bushy tailed.  Katy got up to go to the restroom, stumbled into the kitchen and observed us for about 2 minutes and then stumbled back into the bed and is now circling Pluto or some other planet by now.  Poor dear has been pretty tired lately with all of the work she has been doing at Wallyworld.... Speaking of Wallyworld it is amazing to me how many people living in Charleston SC who have never heard of Walmart being called Wallyworld.  I guess that either makes me weird or they have been living under a rock.  Maybe they just do not even go to Wallyworld and therefore would not have a clue...  Either way, they are missing out on some great prices and are not going to meet great people like us.    Tomorrow, August 5, 2004 marks three years since our daughter Jessica graduated to her place in Heaven.  Its very hard to believe that she has been gone that long.  Just yesterday I was reading an article about a young girl who was 8 years old who had the same type of pediatric cancer who ran a lemonade stand called Alex's Lemonade Stand.  Apparently she started it to raise money to donate to the childrens hospital where she was getting treatments.  Alexandra was her name and she had a dream to raise 1 million dollars for the childrens hospital in hopes that they could use the money to care for other children just like her. This is the link to the website that talks more about Alexandra and the charity lemonade stand she started.   urlLink Alex's Lemonade Stand  As I was reading this story of course I started to think about our Jessica and that Jessica had something very similar to little Alexandria.  It is so sad when little children get this sick and then ultimately lose their battle with cancer and die.  These children bring so much life and cheer into our worlds even when they are sick.    Our lives will never be the same folks.  Our Jessica is gone in body but she is still here in spirit and a part of our family.  Jessica was only one part of our family but like our other children she was an important part of our family who brought who she was into the family environment.  Jessica was the peace keeper of the four children.  Jessica was always mending fences and being the referee or moderator between Justin and Kristina.  More often than not she wound up protecting her younger more mild mannered brother from his older more agressive sister Kristina.  Jessica was so full of life and was a very loving child.  Jessica loved riding her bycycle and coloring in her coloring book.  Jessica loved visits to see Ed the apple eating and daddy biting horse down the street.  One late evening 3 years ago Katy and I were feeding Ed his nightly snack when we ran out of goodies.  I was apparently too close to the fence and Ed's ever powerful jaws when he became upset at the loss of goodies, reached across the fence and nibbled on my tummy.  Gosh, that hurt.   LOL...  Something to remember my Jessica by I suppose.  As of last Tuesday my tour with Goodwill ended.  After 4 months of working there I decided that I could not work in that environment such as it was.  I guess you could say the PC Recycle Center that I was working in was going through some major growing pains and undergoing some daily transitions that were sort of painful.  I tried as I might to try and deal with the stresses that were associated with the job.  Sadly enough I am sorry to say that it just did not work.  Perhaps I was the wrong person for the job to begin with.  Well anyway, so much for that, the Goodwill chapter has closed.  The important thing for me to say at this point is that Goodwill as an organization is an awesome organization in that they turn 92 cents of every donation back into programs that reach out into the community and help those who are struggling or less fortunate than I am.  Atleast when I took this job I held on to my security job to see if this was going to work out.  When I first took the position I felt that there would be some possible conflicts with my immediate supervisor.  Knowing that going into this environment I made sure to have a safety net just in case things did not work out.  I am so glad that I did not quit my security job because now I have been able to go back to a full time schedule with them.  There is no shortage of work when it comes to folks needing security in this day and age.  One of my four children, Jeremy who lives in a suburb of Houston Texas is attending summer school in Wharton.  Actually, he is taking college courses during the summer.  Jeremy is studying music theory.  I am trying to wrap my tiny little brain around what exactly music theory would be.  I guess it is a good thing he is taking this course and not me.   LOL....  I do know that I love music and sound and that I enjoy working with it at church.  I handle all of the technology related tasks with regards to audio and video needs.  I am the guy that sits in the sound booth and either makes you sound good on stage or if I chose to I can make you sound like a chipmunk on steroids.  The digital effects module of the sound board can do some pretty funny things with your voice.  So, with that said, be sure to be nice to the sound guy because he can either make you or break you when you are singing.  LOL... I am very proud of Jeremy Moffitt.  Jeremy is on a wonderful track and he is pursuing something that he loves very much which is music.   Well, it is time to get ready for our mens fellowship meeting and a day at the City Magistrate's office doing security.  Have a great day!!
