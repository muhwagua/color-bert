       Sunday Bluez....   Yesterday i went to a seminar....yeah i know on a SUNDAY...Yep lol...it was required for class.....so otherwise i wouldve stay home and watch the  eagles kick the cowboys ass ...cant u tell im a eagle fan...lol . BUT anyway i m glad i went it turned out to be very interesting. Basically it was a multicultural seminar and very eye opening and so emotional. Its still hard to swallow that people go through issues in this country that we shouldnt have to. I mean we talked about a bunch of shhh and it was so amazing. My class is very diverse from jewish to middle eastern to phillapino to latino/a to black to all types of other stuff. But it was very interesting to see our opinions on things. Its breaks my heart to hear some of the things that people have to go thru in this country....from sterotypes to discrimination...its aweful. All i can say is that i had a very emotional Sunday...other than the  EAGLES KICKING THE COWBOYS ASS...and WANTING TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF MEADOW FROM THE SAPRANOS . She starting to get on my nerves,  TONY  needs to check her ass. Oh yeah how nasty was  adrianna  earlin on that cops lol green puck lol thats was so damn funny.

       Yo ive been thinkin lately, why do we refer to people who are from the middle east as  arabs . Today i was thinking (cause my mom called them arabs that sparked my thought)...the proper name is middle easterners. I was like okay isnt Arabia a country so they would be classified as Arabs, not Pakastan(sp), India, Afganastan(sp), and etc. The only term i think that applies to is Saudi Arabia and Arabia lol so please stop calling all them people Arabs, they are  MIDDLE EASTERNERS  lol that is starting to urk the hell out of me

       Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood    remember Mr. Rogers, lol i used to like that show...well anyways...today is such a beautiful day...it nice and warm...leaves are falling...beautifull colors everywhere...damn i luv this time of the year....My favorite seasons are winter and fall...im a winter baby, born in december...so i luv cold weather because it reminds me of all the gifts im soon to get lol....thats vain huh...lol my b-day is a week before christmas and i never got slighted as a kid...my parents couldnt try that "you get you gifts on christmas stuff"...cause a sister would tripp...so ive always gotten stuff for both christmas and my b-day...the reason why i say this is because i know some people whose b-days are before christmas and theyre parents would be stingy wit the gifts or wouldnt celebrate their b-days at all...never my parents...I LUV THIS TIME OF YEAR...did i already say that lol...this time of the year is so romantic to me...i luv the smell of burnt leaves..but most importantly being able to pull out like 2 comforters and curl up and watch moives...lol aww...damn i wish i had a boo...lol....but yeah nothing like cuddling when its cold or rainy....rain is so sexy....yall probably think im crazy...oh well lol..it is....especially when its raining hard and you can hear it hit the ground like your in a waterfall....thats my favorite...i call them dayz lazy dayz...cause all i want to do is sleep or curl up....(wouldnt mind if i had a warm body next to me lol, but OH WELL)...If you cant tell, im a cuddly person...better yet im a touch feely type of person...i luv physical stimulation of the skin ( and no i dont mean SEX)...things like massages, kissing, rubbing, holding, caressing....get my point.....but yeah this is the perfect time of year for that...my favorite seasons...plus that means that its football and basketball season....  Am i the only person in the world who has a messed up day if my team loses the night before...i take that stuff personally...i hate to lose...especially for one of my teams to lose...i guess you can say im a die hard sports fan...i have to give myself a peep talk after the eagles or sixers lose and say its not that serious...lmao....oh well...My Sixers won tonight they blew out the CAVS. yeah yeah yeah baby *dancing lol**....but um hmmm they won...and i was happy that the offense was putting up some points...40 points in the 3rd quarter....it was 93 or 94 points at the end of the third...thats called balling...All in all im a hugh sports fan...i have my teams but i follow all of them...I watch Sports Center, PTI (pardion the interruption), Best Damn Sports Show, Inside the NFL and many others regurally. I cant wait till they play the sixers game on Sports Center...please believe im going to stay up and wait till i see it lmao. One luv good night SOULsag.

Justin’s Justified and Tweet’s Southernhummingbird ….who ever said her album wasn’t good lied….with both of these guys….i feel like they in my head….because they sound just like me….so if you don’t know now u know…go cope these albums…they are truely on point….one luv Soulsag

       Heated....    okay not only did my beloved  Sixers  lose...and dropped 3 str8 but to cap off my night i flipped to  CSNBC ...and what was on…the  Donahue Show  …their topic was for the night was .... Affirmative Action ...no problem still not pissed...but when they said that white men are actually angry in this country of AF…I got little heated…as guest they had  Al Sharpton, Tom Buchanon (sp), and some other guy …Now this Buchcanon guy made me want to slap him…he had the nerve to say that we should remedy the situation by discrimination against whites…your boy even had the balls to say that blacks only have AF because they cant hack it….what kind of mess is that…Al Sharpton stated blacks are getting AF because for years we couldn’t get jobs or quality education in this country (which is a known fact)…A member from the audience stated, how are blacks or any other minorities benefiting when each group still has a higher unemployment rate than white people…  Basically what angry white men are saying is that they cant get jobs since organizations have quotas and hire minorities who are not qualified for those positions....that really made me sick....a sister became even more heated and pissed off...what the fuck....how many years have minorities been segregated or shun upon when it can to equal right….the reason why we do have AF is because obviously if it wasn’t there…what would be the chances that people would get a fair chance and shit wouldn’t remain the same….ummm unlikely….that’s why we have it…these people (angry white men)…are trying to make it seem as if minorities are not qualified for anything…Then Buchcanon made the worst statement in the world by saying that African Americans do not need to get reparations….HELLO…why the hell not…as much as we go through in this country they owe us something…how can u oppress a group for so long and not feel that you owe them something…My stand on Reparations is that it  SHOULD NOT BE $$$$ , it should be produced in the form of  FREE EDUCATION …Knowledge is power….just had to share my grievances with you…one luv SOULsag.

       MasterPlan...    Right now I’m so confused....I don’t know what I want to do....currently I’m looking into grad school's for a Master's...but I’m having trouble weighing my options on what's going to be best for me....I want to get an degree that is versatile...well I shouldn't say I don’t want I want because I don’t have an idea....I want to be a college counselor in a counseling center atmosphere...but at the same time…. I don’t know if I want to get a Master's in College Counseling....School Counseling...Social Work...or etc....my dream is to counsel adolescents and early adults...but later I may want to branch into starting my own practice in child counseling or etc...so right now I’m scared because I don’t want to make a wrong chose...another dilemma I’m experiencing is that I want to do an accelerated program where I can get my degree in a year or a year and a half tops…I don’t want to be going to school another 2-3 years…I don’t have time for that…I want to get this process over ASAP…lol…plus most of the programs I’m looking at want you to take the GRE’s and complete 48-50 credits once your in their program…GRE’s I can deal wit but damn 50 credits is a whole lot….I’m stressing out man, big time….I need to talk to my teacher because I need some guidance on possibly the most important decision of my life…I think I will do that…one luv SoulSAG…

       I know what guys like, I know what they want...    Actually I don’t but I think about it …I’ve always wanted to know what boys want or what do they think….its like an unsolved mystery…why do they do the things they do…why do they act so nonchalant…why do need to be with multiple girls and not faithful to just one…why do they hide their emotions…why do they put on fronts…why do they lie or just plain ole say things that they don’t mean….why do they luv sex so much….why is a fat ass so enticing….why doesn’t being smart rank high on their mate list….why cant they resist the power of the P—SY…why are they so sexist…why do they care what their boys think….why do they brag on themselves…why does saying things like “I have a big d—k” matter when your really don’t….why do they have to be so defensive…why do they have to be so blind (ex. Not paying attention to detail)…why do they forget all the important things…why does marriage and settling down scare them…why cant they figure out that it’s the little things that count….why do they think that being romantic or affectionate = having sex…why  do they play games….These are all questions that have cross my mind about guys and some of the things they do…If I knew the answer to these questions then damn I would have accomplished a lot…however its never ending riddle…. just like why are roses red and violets are blue…I have come to the conclusion that because they simply are….one luv soulSAG

       On a Sports Note....    Okay right now im mad at the  Sixers  for losing two games.....in texas which they should have one...im not liking what im seeing on the offensive end...they dont look into it....everybody seems to not have any engergy....and they are falling back into their old mind state.....which is  AI  shooting it alot....and his teammates spending most of their time looking for him....i hate that shit....and i hate losing...i take that personally...now on to the  eagles ...damn i was wishing  atlanta  could have beat the  bucs ....so u know i was disappointed as hell when i found out they got spanked....im not a Falcons fan....the reason why i wanted them to win is because I wanted the Bucs to lose so the Eagles can go into first place without a tie....even though the eagles have the go ahead over tampa i still wanted them to be able to breathe with a 1 game or 1/2 a game lead....okay next.... Congratulations to my Alumater(sp) William Penn High School for being the 2002 FOOT BALL STATE CHAMPIONS ....beating St. Marks 34-13....Go Colonials....shout out to my lil brother  #86 ....next year will be your time to shine....im talking about all state....holla.....thats all for todays sports update....one luv SOULsag.....

Amen to that…again after listening to Christina’s new album for like the millionth (is that a word) time…I can say I really like her messages on this album…I smell the empowerment…girlfriend is serious on this album…we all need to walk away from something or someone that we luv in our lifetimes…not only that but break the cycles that we tend to go thru and fall back into…for instance I had a friend who always measured her worth by what guy paid attention to her…that shit would make me so pissed with her…but I understand that’s her conviction…if a guy wouldn’t like her she would spazz out…me and my other friend would try to boost her self esteem but we knew these sessions would only last for so long…that type of stuff comes from within…and she had to take the initiative to make a change…seriously though I got tired of hearing her put her self down… we tried to tell her they will use u until the last drop or tell u anything to get below the belt…. but she never listened…and would continue to be so naïve when it came to guys or life in general…home girl would always comment on stuff like marrying a man with money or only thinking light skinned guys are cute…now I luv me some chocolate brothers so u know I had to tell her about her self quick and early….not only that but yall know I got issues with the whole depending on a man thing….boiling it down though she had problems…we all have em…some deeper than others…but in the end we need to break the habit and walk away from them….I’m going into the right field “counseling”…some people simply need an good ear and I’ve been told I’m a great listener…well that’s all for tonight….one luv….SOULSag

       A Single Snow Day         one of the things i like about living on the east coast is that it snows...this means that there will be randomn days off from work or school...and time to catch up on being lazy lol...I cant image that people in this country or this world have never seen snow...that is so wierd to me....every since i was lil i could remember playing in snow or being excited because i knew Christmas was near...my birth day was near....i luved having school canceled and being able to go sleding on countless hills ....snow is definitely a staple of my youth....i cant ever imagine being without it....  Today was so lovely...no school..... no work...just me and my PJ's...writing my paper....watching tv...browsing the web...reading my favorite weblogs....cleaning off my car...laying in my bed....hope i can do it all again tomorrow. one luv soulSag....

       The Power of Song     Stripped of all the make-up/ no need for fancy clothes/ no cover ups, push-ups/ with him, i dont have to put on a show/ he loves every freckle, every curve/ every inch of my skin/ fullfilling me entirely/ taking all of me in/ he's real/ he's honest/ he's loving me for me/ yeah     After listening to  Christina Aguilera's song Luv Me for Me ....thats pretty much one of my top things to be in a relationship...It can be so simple but yet so complicated at times...i mean i know sometimes i can be hard to deal with...i can make you sick...or get on ya damn nerves...but at the same time....im simplistic....meaning i dont ask for much....im easy going....funny....smart....verstile....and much more....for instance im one of those girls who would prefer a man to cook for me rather than go out...i like the little things...like watching sports or movies and being curled up on the couch with one another....im pretty much an affectionate person...i like all that stuff....But at the same time....you would be suprised how many people cant accept you for you....and how many issues come up in relationships because a person wants to change u and wont let u be you....ive learned that lesson....its either all or nothing...you cant change a person or conform them to who you want them to be...to go deeper....you cant even ignore the lil shit about them that gets on your nerves...because in the end its still apart of that person....damn yall christina has inspired me tonight....i wish i could sing about a guy who luvs me for me....hopefully one day i too can experience the true strong healthy luv that goes on between a couple...the kind where you dream about each other when your apart....we hear so many songs inspired by good luv....but actually my question is does a  Luv Me for Me , true luv actually exist....how ironic is it that the next song that hits my speakers is  Common's Come Close featuring Mary J ....that too is the kind of luv i want but whether it actually feels like that is another thing.... one luv soulSAG    Your lips, your eyes, you smile, your kiss/ I must admit its apart of me/ you please me, complete me, filling me/ like a melody/ your soul, you flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof/ We were meant to be/ but the best quality that's hooking me is that your lovin me for me/ is that your loving me for me

I already heard like 6 of the songs from  MP3.com  so i already knew i would like it.....  Yesterday i went to my lil brother's football game...damn it was so boring...the score at half time was 0-0 and i was freezing my ass off...it started to rain....so i wasnt feeling the whole situation...Well both teams started to score in the 3rd and 4th quarters i seen some of that...and when my brothers team got down 8 min until the end of the 4th, his big sister had to roll out  lol....hell i couldnt feel my feet which reminds that  Pea Coats  aint shit...wool.... woooolll that shit suppose to keep your ass warm well guess what i was still freezin....okay back to the subject....well they won...18-15 and i missed the most exciting parts...but owe well...cause heat and being dry will beat a football game anyday...this is why i dont go like that, especially when it gets cold... and mainly why i luv b-ball....Speaking of which the  Sixers  beat the  Wizards  last night....wasnt pretty but hey i'll take the win...still second in the east....7 game winning streak so thats what up.....he he he he....hopefully the  Eagles  can pull one out today....one luv SOULsag

       The Lebron James Situation....    okay this shit is making me mad....how dumb can a person be...if you are in highschool driving around in a H2...which is valued at over 50,000 dollars...not to mentioned this is a gift from your mom....who supposely lived in the projects....and you come from a dire up bringing...who took out a loan to buy you this car...thats real wack to me...i hate to see people of color (black people)...do dumb shit...for those who dont know this boy got caught recieving a gift valued at around $850 (2 throwback jersey's)...but anywayz...so he was declared ineligable to play b-ball (but he is petitioning it)...mind you this is his senior year...he was ranked as #`1 player in the country...the point(s) im trying to make is...people claim this boy can be even better than jordan...he had a future set ahead of him...he basically blown everything for 2 fucking throw backs...why cant people just live a str8 and narrow life...you know that the lime light is on you...people are watching your every move...just do the fucking right thing...taking a loan out for a Hummer 2 doesnt sound like the right thing to do...if my son was in high school and the # 1 player in the country...i wouldnt be drawing attention to him by buying him fancy cars that other 17-18 year olds dont drive...if he wants a car...get him a piece of shit like any other parent...this is a kid who was expect to go pro next year...he can buy a gang of cars so why was it important for him to have an h2 now...now him and his mom know the price of being a national celebrity so to speak...he could have potentially fucked up his future buy not setting his priorities...and plenty of people are probably wishing he fails...this shit is definitely biting him in the ass now...

       Thank You's...    thank you to the  Philadelphia Eagles ....for another let down....just like all philadelphia sports teams...they have disappointed their wit another lack luster performance...all the energy floating around for dear ole  eagles fans  has again been deflated...im not bitter that they lost...but like all other fans...the way in which they lost...no effort what so ever on offense...now im not as mad wit the defense because i think they did what they could do and at least they did try....but the offense on the other hand...didnt do shit...fustrating to let someone come into your house more hyped than you...sort of reminds me of the last game of the season...when the offense went on an early vacation...pissed i am...at those sorry mutherfucka's....not only letting their fans down...but blowing another year...not to mentioned it is not even a guarantee that everyone will be back next year on the roster...so therefor we dont know what to expect as fans...but anyways i place the blame for this lost on  Andy Reid and D-McNabb ....for  Andy ...how are you going to call the plays and not notice till the 2nd half that the bucs defense was moving up on first downs and laying off on 2nd and 3rd...for  D-McNabb ....how are you going to be the team leader and didnt have your troops hyped...only people that played yesterday like they had some damn sense was the  Defense and Special Teams ....other than that offense left the team hanging....well this is my gripes....one pissed eagles fan along wit millions....this is one of the reasons why philly fans are so intense and irate...try coping wit sports let downs year after year after year....one luv SOULSag...

       Up's, Down's and Everywhere else...    Today started cool....everything was going great....its mad cold out side...feel like its like  10 degrees ....bbbbbrrrrr....but anyways despite getting up at  6:45 am ...taking my ass to class...running behind schedule....having to park far away in the lots....then walking in this bitter cold weather to class....i was fine...still in a moderate mood...but then someone has to come a long and test my gangsta...saying shit they dont even know about...so i go to work in a sour mood...but after being around the kids (remember i work with kids from kindergarten to 6 grade), i was back in a okay mood...i usually soothe my worries by coloring or playing wit them...especially the kindergarten class....theyre like my kids...lmao...but by another mother and daddy....so i was smooth sailing until the older kids started being disruptive...see what happen was....this one kid supposely gets teased by the other kids everyday...calling him fart boy or drawing pictures on the computer of him seems to be their choice of amusement...plus they all join in to make fun of him...so today he snapped...and therefor pushed a table into another boy's nose...could have been drastic but fortunately it wasnt broken....i didnt even know all that was going on...so then i had to scold all of the kids...and will definitely get in some ass tomorrow (give them a long as speech)...all because of teasing....see im the type of person who you dont say shit to unless you expect something back (smart ass remark)...im not the type of person who goes out of my way to say shit to people...im pretty much laid back...go wit the flow...until im push to be something else...so therefor i know how the boy felt but in a way i didnt...he takes so much from the kids who tease him...see they would have had one time to say some grimy shit to me before i snapped (got ignorant)...but then i understand that he took so much until he couldnt take it anymore...this has been going on for a while supposely...but he never told a counselor (me or my co-workers)...well it all will come to an end tomorrow...i am very opinionated and they will get my point by the end of the day...just my no good very bad day lol...well it wasnt that bad...oh yeah one of my kindergarten students wrote me a note that said "i love you" signed wit her name...awwww that took me back out a sour mood...one luv SoulSag.

       The Price to Look Good...    man i just spent most of my day getting my hair done (or did if ya black)...from 10-1:30...damn i didnt even get that much done...basically this has inspired me to talk about what drastic measures women go through to be beautiful in todays society...we are going thru all types of gagets, procedures, and crap just to look good for the opposite sex...i mean i luv me some men but is this shit really worth it...i guess so if you dont want to be fucking lonely...but i do know who is real happy...that would have to be the comestic and clothing manufactors...shit i would be happy to prosper off of women who in their minds think they have flaws (too dark, too fat, too short, too whatever)... well anyway...i wanna know when is most of us finally going to wake up and realize that beauty comes in all flavas (shape, sizes and colors)...instead of trying to live up to some fucking society pipe dream which doesnt include most of us...one luv soulSAG

You luv me incredibly, from the head to the soles of my feet/ you know you make me complete, baby/ and you love oustandingly/ cant contain it need a moment to breath/ keep on loving me, baby.---Vivian Green "A Love Story" track 13

IM SPENT ...when i come home i dont want to talk to no body but my computer or bed (seriously)....this week has been so challenging...this past week all Delaware schools have been doing manditory  STATE TESTING ...i feel bad for these kids...this test is stressing them out to the 9th degree...the teachers are stressed also because some of their kids will fail...(side note: how can you make ESL kids take a state test on math, reading and writing when they are not fluent in english, that sucks, then you have kids who are in special education who are expected to take a standardize test that is the same for all kids in their grade, WTF, this shit sucks big time)...and guess who's in charge of it....the guidance counselors....so ive been running around like a chicken helping my boss sort through test....administer them...and plain ole being helpful to all of the specialist and teachers...the rough part was the first day...i was so drained mentally/physically...i literally came home and put my self in bed around  7:30 (actually just laid there like a veggie until i doze off)...its all good though but i still luv the job....  i want to be a counselor but im currently still figuring out on which level (elementry or college)....i finally sent off my grad app (late last week)...waiting patiently...i feel confident i will get in...this school has an accelerated program in school and college counseling...i want to be done in a year so i plan to start june or july....i cant take this school stuff anymore trying to finish ASAP....right now im also looking for jobs...so far i went on one interview...man did the job suck big time...plan b: is to apply for a state job...i found one that is pretty cool..hopefully they will get back to me (if not i will use my connects and resourses)...im trying to move out wit my friend next year around this time so i need some loot (give me the loot)....contact me if you want to send me some donations...its comes wit a complementry kiss...lol i need a sugar daddy (rich one, who luvs to write checks or give out cash) sik nah i'll be alright...  All of my friends are teasing me now...why cause i work at a school (which we call a  "Real Job" )...so therefor i get to play dress up...and look lovely...i thought that this transition would be hard for me (since im a timb/nike rockarkindagurl to the 10th power)...but it wasnt...i mean dont get me wrong i can still sexy out the best of em...i have shoe's, boots, sandals and what not...but i prefer 70% thuggin em out on that chill ghetto fab-boo-lust tip (you should all the clothes and shoes i have, its ridiculous)...but im starting to like rocking thin heel boots, dress shirts and slacks every day...its growing on me i guess...i havent purchased anything like a sneak, timb, or jean in a minute...im fiendin though...i get the shakes "i must buy new shit"...sik nah...well back to the joke...my girl always say's "your a grown up now"...which she is right....so i get all big head on her...when she calls and starts buggin i be like  "HEY YOUR TALKING TO AN ADULT NOW, RECOGNIZE" ...she either pays me no mind or tells me to shut the hell up....its unbelievable though...im finally an adult or acting like one...its feels weird too despite my 22 years on this planet...lol well this is a long as post for me...guess i had a lot of shit to say...well im going to go do the whoop to the latest videos on  MTV and BET ...right now im bumping donnie/india arie, i need to shake my ass....i guess im just cool like that....im serious im going to dance in front of the TV...do some crazy dances wit my brother (who at 6'2 looks funny dancing)...one luv SoulSag....

       Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation/ Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation/ Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation/ He’s looking at Self love self preservation/ Self love self preservation, Self love self preservation     After watching  Brown Sugar  today…I found the inspiration to listen to one of my old cd’s….so I popped in  Jaguar Wright’s debut album "Denials Delusions And Decisions" ….she is a phenomenal singer….too bad her record label didn’t do all they could to promote her album….str8 gangsta…but anyways I wanted to listen to the song that they played at the end of  the movie…. # 11 on the album entitled "Self Love" …basically the song put me in a trance…good shit…listening to Jaquar preach about inner peace…making your own decisions…luving yourself…despite your situation…man she is going hard on this song…she’s right…get up off your ass get out and do something….sooooo many people don’t luv themselves….but how can you luv someone else if you cant luv you…I can say I luv myself…im totally into me…luving me unconditionally…now i'm going to talk about these women out here who don’t luv themselves….  You know the ones who let men run all over em….sit at home crying cause they have 2 kids by this nicca and no commitment….no ring…and nothing to show for it… women have a tendancy to put men before themselves…usually about  HIM  instead of about  YOU …if your man is cheating on you…and not treating you how you want to be treated leave  HIS  ass….do bad by your self….now for the brothas….if your girl is a  SKANK  and you complain about getting nothing but  SKANKS ….then maybe you should stop chasing  THE PUSSY …of course you going to find nothing but chicken headz, gold diggers, and skeezers(sp)…but what can you expect…chasing a phat ass and big titties doesn’t give you the information you need to find a good girl…so don’t complain when your relationships don’t amount to shit…I say  “cant turn a hoe into a house wife” …and its the truth…for both males and females…basically the key is to respect and love yourself…not to settle…not to cheat yourself of what you think you should be getting….fuck the cycle…break out of that shit…do you…its about choices…make good ones….    If you don’t like your job, why don’t you just quit stop being a bitch love yourself/ If you believe things kind work out easily,/ I’m telling you if you don’t like what your mother’s telling you/ Then be a grown man and stand up on your own two and love yourself/ If your girlfriend’s is on welfare, then baby walk away/ You don’t have to care and love yourself/ And if standing on the corner and pushing rocks up in your sock/ Ain’t what you want to do to night then love yourself

       Guess who's bizzzack...         I am so overjoyed that the new season for  urlLink Soul Food  has finally started...and guess what???...last night they came back with a bangin episode...for those who are soul food junkies like myself, how about that opening sex scene...can you say, ohhh booyyyy...man that was str8 juicy...but how crazy is Bird's stalker...that dude has some serious damn issues...or what about Damon's denial of his drinking problem...my baby needs to get it together (damn he Fine with a capital "F")....overall it was a dynamite show...the season preview indicates that soul food will be off the chain and action packed...oh yeah im going to be watching everyweek...   does anyone watch Wanda at Large...its comes on fox after bernie mac..i like the show, I think its hilarious...Wanda says some off the wall stuff..ive been a fan of hers every since she was in Chris Rocks last movie (forget the name, but i also seen her do her thing on HBO's Inside the NFL)...ohh and one more thing...  im starting to get really pissed off with American Idol...the show seems to be on its way back to voting off people who dont deserve to leave...man i cant  for the life of me understand why Kimberly Locke (the voluptious black chick) is always in the bottom 3 every week...her performances are always on point, even the judges think so...but somehow America cant get it together...in my opinion, her and Ruban are the most consistant...everybody else is okay but i just think that those two deserve to win...just look at last night...  they voted off the cheery black dude...whose performances were getting better each week (to me his last 2 or 3 were solid)...but the other kimberly (the chick he was standing with) got by even though she sucked...same with Carmen, whose performance of Blondie was horrible....and guess what she didnt even make it into the bottom 3...what the hell is up with that...well thats all for my blockbuster Wednesday's...one luv sOuLSag

       Im starting to hate my job and my co-workers suck...    If it's one thing i hate in the world....its lazy ass co-workers...these two babes at work are seriously plucking my last damn nerve...see at my paying job i work at a after school center...basically our responsibility is to watch kids from 3pm to 6pm (when their damn parents are suppose to pick em up, but i'll talk about that later)...i dont have a problem with watching the kids because thats my job and i get paid for it...but i be damn if im going to be working while my two co-workers are sitting on their lazy asses philosophizing for 3 hours about their boyfriends and their fucked up relationships....hello people we are suppose to be working...maybe my work ethic is different...i know that we all are college students but maybe i am more mature than them...but still thats no damn excuse...that's the real world, if you want to maintain a job, you have to work hard for it....now i could be reasonable if this was a once in a while thang...but hell nah they do this everyday, its their ritual....let me further explain the situation so you can see what im talking about....okay there are 4 of us working and there is 4 rooms full of kids....now the logical thing to do would be split up and each take a room...but nooo these two dummies rather sit in the same room and chit chat, which often leaves me having to cover 2 rooms full of hyper ass midgets...another thing that urks me about those two is...that they are always late to work (especially one) and never wants to walk over to pick up the damn kid's from school...but when its warm...they dont mind walking...but when its freezin like a mutherfucka their asses purposely show up late so they dont have to walk...like i wasnt going to notice that shit...  now last week our school was on spring break...one half of the chatty duo went on vacation to a Dominican Republic resort...so the other stuck to my ass like glow...telling me all about her lastest sobb stories/drama with her boyfriend...how they are going to move into separate apts because they need to have space...like hello..."yall been together for a year and yall been living together for a year...thats what's wrong wit your relationship...yall went from mommy and daddies house...to living together".....i be tellin her that shit too, im her psychologist, should start chargin her stinkin ass but thats another thought...so yeah she be going thru it..but she would rather talk about it during work, instead of actually doing some damn work...well her butt-buddy came back on monday...and guess where they were...sitting on the stinkin couch,catching up...its like they stuck together...if one person is one room, the other will eventually find their way there and hang out....meantime we have unsupervised kids running around like heathens...im gettin tired of that shit real quick... ooohhh let me give yall another good example...one day both of em were sitting in the kindergarten room putting on a video for my babies (thats the kindergarteners, im so attached to them since ive been around them since sept)...so i let time pass for a min...and i think that day it was only us 3 working...so eventually im pissed and i stormed back there like could one of yall come watch this other class...i was so pissed cause i shouldnt have to do that shit...i mean did they think it honestly takes 2 people to watch 12 kindergarteners while im watchin 35 other screamin kids...ohhh hell nooooo....  now on to my other gripe about work...the damn parents...im so so so so so so so so to the fuckin 100th power sick of them fuckers coming late to pick up their own damn kids...hello these your brats not mine dont ya want to come get em...now my damn work day ends at 6:01...not 6:05 or 6:15 or 6:35....i understand you may be in traffic but damn i have a fucking life...i work too, in fact im working from 8am (internship) till the time they pick up their brats...my ass is up at 6:45 in the damn morning...i need to go home and relax too, shit i need a break...and you know what really urks me....when they do come to pick up their kids...they dont even say thank you...what the fuck is up wit that, i be about really to cause a scene...its not like im gettin compensating for their tardiness, hell im only getting my bass rate divided by whatever time they came...im getting tired of this work shit...its all starting to push me away and making me search for a real job even more...  damn yall this is a long ass post...but hey i got to vent..ive been holding all this shit in for a min...one luv soulSag

       Can we be friendz.....part 1    today was my first day running my friendship group...ahhh what a feelin....i met with the 2nd graders today....they were cool...we talked for 30 mins....they seem excited about coming back...in fact one girl asked when they were coming back...she seemed disappointed like the rest when i explain that its only once a week...i wish i could do more...but its just not possible with my schedule and their's....but today went well...we covered things like "what does friendship mean to you", "how can you be a good friend", and "what does bad friendships look like"....its funny to hear their responses....one lil girl was like good friends buy you presents...that was funny...however on thursday i have the 5th graders....im really looking forward to this group...for one i have a hard bunch of gurls (some with behavior problems and fucked up home lives)...so its going to be challenging...but basically i want to act as a mentor for them....its going to be hard to gain their trust....but once i do it should be okay from there....i plan to cover a wide array of topics with both groups like "when to let go of friendships", "shying away from gossip or he/said she said", and much more...hopefully they'll hear my messages and understand them...cause shit dont change when you grow up...i still had to let go of friends that i felt werent about what i was about at the time...or just dead weight....thats a thing i think that the 5th graders really need to understand...its not about rollin wit a cliq...cause at the end of the day, how do you know who really is loyal and who just there to use you up...thats shit i had to learn growing up...its a hard pill to swallow...knowing that everybody isnt out for you best interest...or basically understanding that because your friends its okay to say "no i dont wanna do that or be apart of that"....  But pretty much today....i keep my friends down to a handful...as we use to say in high school...."i dont fuck with everybody"...and 5 years later that's still the truth...growing up i always found that i got along more wit boys than girls...i guess thats because i was a lil tom boy...im like the only girl out of my female friends who luvs sports, plays video games and likes building stuff...im just weird like that...its funny cause i like to watch home improvement shows like  "trading spaces", "this old house" and "bob villa" ...what can i say, im just fascinated with things like that....i guess thats the creative side of me...but anywayz moving on...  Next up  American Idol ....man  Ruban  killed it tonight... Simon  is right he should win the WHOLE competition...if not the American Public SERIOUSLY JACKED HIM...on to the  NBA ... Sixers  won last night in overtime against the  Magic ...it was a pretty good game... AI vs T-Mac ....both recking shop, point for point....on to the  NCAA ...i stand corrected i had a type-o the other day...the  Villanova  Girls B-Ball team mad it to the elite 8...unfortunately they lost last night to the  Tennessee Vols ...its all good though im still proud of em....well thats all yall...one luv soulSag***thanks for the lending ear oooppsss i mean eyes

        UPDATE:    Damn its been a while since i logged on to this. Blogger is moving up in the world, they even have comments now. I remember when they didnt have that shit and people had to use the freebies around the web. Well im no longer apart of the retrosoul fam. At some point in time i decided to put this blogging thing on hold. It became time consuming and i basically wasnt inspired anymore. Not to mention, life changes. I started grad school and was a couple of months into a new job. So all in all the best decision for me was to hand in my bloggin punch card hince was the only reason why i decided to leave retrosoul. That was back in september of 03', i think but dont quote me on that. Anyhoo after not blogging for about 2-3 months, i decided to come back to the game. Now i own my own site entitled "Brown Suga Dreams" over  urlLink here . That is where i occupy most of my time. I still dont blog as much as i like to, but the paste is starting to pick up.   Right now, im halfway through my graduate studies. After this summer semester, i will have 5 classes left. Of those 5 only 3 are actual classes, the other 2 are internship and practicum. So im really excited about that. Will be even more estatic when i finish with this stage in my life. However, school wont be over for me. I then have mad plans to get a doctorate in psychology. Then again that will most likely occur 3-4 years from now. Lol why am i telling you guys all this. I was just simply suppose to update this journal and keep it moving. Two sentences have turned into over 20 most likely. Okay im out. If you want to read more about me and my life, hit me up over at Brown Suga. One.
