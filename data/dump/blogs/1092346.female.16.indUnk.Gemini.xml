      Ah finally.  The trip is almost here.  A time to get away from the annoying parental units and spend time with friends.  It shall be great fun.  Especially my room wow were gonna bring some food I tell ya.  And on a lower note.  I don't know.  Not sure who I  really  like at the moment.  I did like someone else, but I never see him.  And well... All I can say is that I really need some excitement in my life.

      Wow.  I just did it.  I went downstairs, set the table like I was supposed to and ignored every word my mom said.  She asked me if anything was wrong and something else... but I don't remember what cuz I was ignoring her.  I kind of feel like I am screaming on the inside... but it was funny to see her just stop asking me questions because I didn't make a noise or talk.  I like this.  I absolutley hate them.  No doubt about it.  They are so annoying...

      Lately my family buggs the crap out of me.  I think I have literally reached the stage in a teenagers life where you dont speak to or of your family.  I think I should lose my ability to talk.  Then the only way I can express my feelings of anger to them is by giving them the bird.

      People bugg me.  The people who dont give a shit.  I wont name names but I know people who were just Pre-UIL just laughing and squeaking/cracking (not going to give away the instrument) during the whole performance. I will tell you one thing.  They sure aren't in Symphonic Band.  If they were Mr. Matysiak would have stopped the band at a square... made you get of the stage and then go on with where he stopped.    These are people who dont give a crap about band and definatley show it.  I know people who dont give a crap about band.  That doesn't bother me unless they disrupt during a concert/contest or what not.  Talking in class... doesn't bother me at all.  They can do that there... just not a concert.  And when they do it buggs the living shit out of me.  I mean come on people.  Have respect.  For 30 - 45 minutes at a concert.  respect - To feel or show deferential regard for; esteem.  To avoid violation of or interference with: respect the speed limit.  To relate or refer to; concern.   Why do they do it?  I don't know.  I work so hard at what I love and it kills me to see someone dis-respect it like that.  They dont do jack while I work my ass off.  Guess thats how Jack and Ass come together.  Ug.    By the way these people are freshman and I am not naming their names.  If you realize this is you, please get your act together... I notice things.  For those of you who I know hate band (I mean the ones who are IN band)... no I do not hate you.  Some of yall are the coolest people on the planet.  Band is what I love and I dont expect everyone of my friends too.  You can talk in class give a laugh or tell a joke as much as you please.  I do it too.  So does everyone.  Being a Nazi about it is annoying.  People who do that during important things (I.E. CONCERTS and MARCHING SHOWS...) are really the only ones who I have something against.  If you are one of these people and I have offended you, I am sorry.  I just have a passion for it and it literally kills me to see people do that.

      Haha, Tonight was great.  Me, Guilio and Ashleigh went out to dinner at Papa La Rosa's Flying Pizza and then went to Marble Slab for dessert.  Well it ends up that Guilio decided to change the security code on Ashleigh's cellphone and we tried other numbers too much and it wouldnt let us unlock it.  So we went to Cingular store.  They were CLOSED.  Then we went to Ashleigh's house.  Nothing to help us there.  Then we finally try it again after not trying for a while... and it works.  Finally after two hours of stealing Guilio's cellphone and what not.  It was quite a night.  I slept in quite a bit this morning and went to church before all of this.  Today was fun.  I need to get out and do stuff like this more often.    4 more days until San Antonio Trip!!!!  It is going to be a blast.    Truly I am enjoying lifes list of unanswered question's and I am up for some fun!  If you are ever up to doing something just give me a call and you can drive or umm.. wait I cant drive.  At least not legally, but you get my drift.    So give me a call and let's go do something... anything!   Yes I am talking to  you , the person reading this blog.

       I'm No Superman - Scrubs Theme   Out the door just in time, head down the 405, Gotta meet the new boss at 8am. The phone rings in the car, the wife is working hard, She's running late tonight again.  Well, I know what I've been told, you gotta work to feed the soul, But I can't do this all on my own, No I'm no, I'm no superman, I'm no superman.  You've got your love online and you think you're doing fine, But you're just plugged into the wall. And that deck of tarot cards won't get you very far, There ain't no hand to break your fall.  Well, I know what I've been told, you gotta know just when to fold, But I can't do this all on my own, No I'm no, I'm no superman, I'm no superman.  You've crossed the finish line, won the race but lost your mind, Was it worth it after all? I need you here with me, coz love is all we need, Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall.  Well I know what I've been told, you gotta break free to break the mold, But I can't do this on my own, no I can't do this all on my own, I know that I'm no superman, I'm no superman, I'm no superman...  Someday, we'll be together, someday, Someday, we'll be together, someday, I'm no superman.

Romeo and Juilet, I like the story but it is kind of hard to understand.  Then my mom comes in my room and shes like what do you want on the band ad.  I say "I don't know".  She's like what about... Great year Megan.  I say no.  That sounds so stupid shes a frickin idiot, my dad could come up with something interesting sheesh.  What is her fucking problem.    She buggs the crap out of me lately.    I need to go out and do something with my friends.  Hmm, I am bored. I must go fill out my section leader application that I am totally going to BS and Suck-Up on.  And I also need to get Romeo and Juilet Cliff notes ha.  Talk later

      You know what I just thought of?  What is life like outside of this shelterd society we live in?  Is it scary or just damn boring.    I ponder on what my future withholds for me.  There is a world of uncertianty beyond the school buildings, nice houses, and fenced yards...  Confusing, It is.

      Caught in a world of confusion.  What is this society we live in today?  Such high and strange expectations.  I do not seem to understand the importance of this and they satisfaction they get out of torturing us.    You know what... I don't know what I just said.    I should just get ready and go to school.  I will see _______ there :)   ... The spaces are not significant in any way to the persons name.  Or maybe they are?

      Nah.  Eariler today I said I hate band.  That's not true.  Just the truking (substitute word for you know) end of the year I wanna get out of here is coming out.  And my mom talking to me about crap gets me mad.    Do your parents ever piss you off?  I bet they do.  And I bet you a million dollars that mine are worse.  My mom calls my cell phone every five freaking minutes when I am out trying to have a good time away from my family with my friends.  I have gotten into the habit of turning off my phone when I go places.  much more peaceful then.    I usually end up having messages on my phone from hea but who givers.  She is too over protective.  Man, I remember when I wasn't allowed to get in cars with my friends who drive.  That pissed me off.  i would like yell and scream at them ha!  And when I went to the Lacrosse game with Jack, Jeff, Meg, Laura and Terrance my mom and dad were like "We think you should sit in the back seat of whoevers car you ride in."  I was like okay whatever I'll do that.  Ha, theyre so stupid.  Like theyre gonna know.  "You could distract the driver" says my parents.  "Also make sure no one starts laughing and gets the driver to concentrate on anything other than the road" says mom.    They really mean well, but it buggs the shit out of me.  I am so glad I have more freedom than I did last semester.... I was one depreved little child.  Sad thing that is too.  Haha.   Hrm.  I dont really know what I was actually going to talk about on here.  I guess I am letting some more anger out.  Crankyness, end of school.  Thank god!!!!!!!!!    Well I am sorry if there are some mispellings or punctuation errors on here because at the moment I am laying on my brf, cordless keyboard in lap, looking at the cieling and not looking at the keys.  This whole entry should be interesting to look at.  Well, I know I am boring you to death.  I'll tlak to you kids at school.    I wonder when I will have C lunch again... Wim and Liz wanted to order pizza... but then if I do that... I wont get to sit with you know who.  Uno person actually knows who that is so tough luck guessing!  Later kids.  P.S. This not looking at what I am writing helps expressing myself more openly without trying to use different phrases.  Flows more i guess with out reading it to myself thinking I should add this and that...

      I need to get out of this hell hole called school I am stuck in.  To be loved is what I yearn most right now.  Again like I posted a while back.  I do have my eye on  someone .  Are you him?  Or do you even have a clue.  Does anyone seem to notice feelings like this anymore these days.  Guess not... this world and everything in it is poop.    I want school to get out so I can enjoy my summer.  ... Not gonna be home alot, but who cares.  Marching is going to be awesome next year.  Cant wait...

      On Thursday night I went out with Jack, Jeff, Laura, Meg and Terrance.  We went to watch John at his Lacrosse game.  That was great fun.  Go Rangers! (We won)  At half time we went to sonic for some food and we wanted to park the car and pile out of it on the sidelines.  Too bad Jack couldnt find the entrance to do it.  Oh well.  We went to Starbucks after that and sat at a table and talked for a while.  It was a very fun filled evening. Especially when Laura was getting John's keys out of his bag and she found his jock strap.  haha.  Great times it is...

      Some highlights of the week:  Algebra - I got a 93 on my quiz... highest grade in the class lol... I am such a retard.  The problem I missed was our warm up today and I did it and I got it right.  Then here comes back my quiz and I look at what I missed and ugg.  oh well.  93 is still good lol :-P  Lunch - We talk about random stuff... all the time.  Today Cade took my seat so I had to go share a seat with Daniel and Jack.  They scooted over on each side of their round chair and I got a chair! YAY!  Haha, then after that me and Julie tried to see what kind of conversations we could come up with and see how many times Cade tried to bud in.  We started talking about how we should have latteral time zones and stuff and then just as we realize it Cade tried to get a few words in on our conversation and soon Lisa, Erik, Katie, and John were talking about it.   That was great stuff.    Lunch yesterday -  I had brought those little circus animal crackers that are like pink and white.  You know, the ones everyone had when they were little.  lol.  So we get talking about foods we ate when we were little and Erik Locascio said that his mom wouldn't allow him to eat chocolate when he was little so he always had circus animals or animal crackers.  He said that the circus animals were like crack to him as a kid.  Great stuff.  English - Well yesterday I found out my 5th 6 weeks average.  I was kind of disappointed because I had a 97 on progress reports.  My average now is a 92 :(   But that's I got an 82 on my SAT vocab test and a 73 on Animal Farm test.  That was HARD!  Too many thinking questions for me!  But hey on the brighter side... I got a 100 on my inner circle outer circle discussion on Animal Farm and that was a Major Grade!  I can think of any more right now, but I know there is more... I'll post later if I remember.  I have my eye on  someone ...

      Have you ever felt for someone so much but were too scared to tell?  What if that person would never talk to you after that because they did not feel the same way?  What would they do, what would they say?  These questions run through my head day and night lately.  I haven't actually liked someone in so long.  It is like I almost forget what to do.    You think you see him looking at you from the corner of his eye, but you cant tell.  I look at him from the corner of my eye.  Does he think the same thing I do?  And if he does... is he as afraid to ask to find out as I am?  I hope and pray to God that I can have courage to find out, some way or another.  Crazy as I can be... I'd spin around in circles and see how fast I can run down the stairs without falling.... *cough* texas tech...  Still, amongst my outgoing self, witty personality and bubblyness there is a point where I cannot express myself.  I can show people I am happy, sad...but the hardest thing is to tell someone you love them.  When you have had your heartbroken you never want (or enjoy) to do that to someone else or have it done to you.  That, my friends, is why I don't know how to tell this "crush" of mine.  You will get no clues, therefore, he could be reading this right now.    Are you him?  Do you feel like this about anyone?  IM me and Tell... aim:  trumpeteyetis

      I know.  Dont say it.  You are going to tell me I am supposed to love and care for my family because they are the ones who will always be there.  Well, your wrong... I DONT!    They just bug the living shit literally out of me.  I am not even joking.  And to top that off they have been getting into my personal life.  My dad has some program that tracks everything I do on the internet so he can limit my instant messaging use.  For all I know he can be reading what I am typing on this here blog right now.  My mom... argh.  She just buggs me too.  Whenever i get up finally to go do what she told me to, at that same moment she comes in and gives me this long lecture about it.  ANd she gets mad when i try and tell her thats what i was getting up to do.  You just dont understand.  Little brothers... bugg the living daylight out of me too.  Wait i mean living shit.  hes just so annoying i cant take any of this any more.  And my dad.  Hes cool.  Actually you know how girls run to their mommys to talk about crap.  Well, no siree... thats not me.  I'd rather talk to my dad.  Honestly.   I know, my life seems so miserable right now.  But what i said up there only referrs to the "some things in life suck"  in my profile.  THe other half of that is "but others are just perfect".  That, my friends, is you.  The ones I can talk to and go hang out with out of the house so i can get away from my parents.  But most of all that referrs to someone else...  That would be you Rick.  Rick, you rock my world right now and I love spending time with ya!  You make my day so much more enjoyable.  Enough about me... I want to hear about you...

Whenever I try to talk I sound like a boy going through puberty hahahaha.    Last night I went to Ashley Arnold and Laura Matysiak's Graduation party... That was SOOOO MUCH fun!!!  :)  All I can really say right now is that exams suck and I am going to really miss my senior friends.  I am so glad i met all of yall this year!  You really helped me adjust into what I thought was going to be the scariest year of my life... Y'all dont forget to come back and visit.    Graduation Song - Vitamin C... good song folks.  Later, I am out.

      I know, I know.  You are going to tell me that I am a freshman and I dont even need to think about this but you know what, I have been lately.  And it scares me to a degree.  This year has flown right before my eyes.  Just the thought of it leaving depresses me.  I really wish I could stay a freshman forever, not really having anything to worry about except get used to high school.  But no, in three weeks it will all be over.  Then I will only have 3 more years living at home in the comfort of my own room and the city I grew up in.  Then if all goes as planned I will go to UT at Austin and pursue a degree in music there.  Yeah, I'm a die-hard longhorn fan... I lived there for two years.  To me it just seems like next year wont be the same as this year has been.  Yeah, the juniors and sophmores will still be here.  And my 8th grade friends will be freshman... hehe beware kids.  But see, I will miss the seniors.  They have really been there for me, helped me out.  Laughs, crazy times.  Taking me home when my parents cant.  The inside jokes, and just the fact that I was one of three fish in Matysiak's band.  You know, life is so unpredictible.  Zooming right before my eyes I dont know what my future withholds.  I wish to know.  But I cant.  All I can do is live my life day by day.  Thats what I have been doing.    Honestly, I dont think I have ever looked at life with this perspective until maybe late last semester... or more this semester.  Even though I do not know what is in the road ahead of me, I am excited but scared at the same time.  Will it be the same without the seniors next year?  What will I be like?  Will I change?  Will I still be the same Megan Elizabeth McDonough I am today?  Who knows.  This is all coming to me right now from looking at the yearbook and just imagining what the next three years have set aside for me.  Right now I am treasuring every moment I have.  You and all my friends will be memories for years to come.  The laughs, the times, the cries, the everything.  I want each and everyone one of you to know that no matter what, when we have high school reunions in 10-20 years I wont forget you or your face.    I cant wait to see what my future has set aside for me...

      San Antonio was so darn fun!!!  I loved every minute of it.  Being with my close friends, riding rollercoasters over and over and doing everything else imaginable.    Hotels were actually really nice.  Microwaves, fridge.  Great fun.  Concert went well too.  But what sucks is I fell down the steep hill in my dress shoes.  Thought I ruined my trumpet for a minute but apparently all I have is a bruise on my butt and one my elbow.  I still say it is Eric Chi's conspiracy.  My knee in marching band, and I was behind him when this happened.    I cant wait to see what happens next.  Oh.  And at the Magic Time Machine for lunch this morning... well I had to go to the bathroom.  So I went up to some random waiter and asked him "Where are the bathrooms?"  It ends up when they are asked that they walk you around the restaurant making a huge deal of it, shouting it to everyone you know.  Great fun.  That restaurant has the coolest tables and everything!  I want to go back there when I go to San Antonio for the DCI show this summer!  Well it's time for me to go pick up my pictures.  I will scan them in later and put my digital camera pics in later too.  Check the website for San Antonio pictures.  I will probably have them up by wednesday or so because I have some homework to work on before tomorrow.  See you later kids.

      Oh yeah.  I didnt explain how my listening with Mr. Austin's dad went.  Man, that was like so good!  He gave me all these really good compliments and explained a bunch of stuff!!  It was so helpful!  He said I had tons of talent and that if I worked hard and had Mr. Austin and himself help me out alot i could do great things!  That made my day so much better since i am grounded!  He pretty much came out and said i was all-state material.  I was liek WOAH!  hehe sweet :) made me happy :)

      Well I am grounded.  Oh well.  Til next monday.  Then starting next thursday I have summer school for two weeks.  No, I didn't fail anything... I am taking speech and healt so i dont have to during school.  Haha, suckers.  Being grounded isnt that bad.  I think my mom is going to let me go to that Texas Music Festival at UH and Erik Plate's birthday party on saturday!  HORRAY!!!  That will make me happy :)  I guess now that I am grounded i can stay home and do some summer cleaning and things i need to do.  Clean room, write thank you notes for my bday.  It should be that bad.  Then I will also have a chance to practice my sexy sir!!!  By the way... my sexy sir is my trumpet.  His real name is Suiravidarts (you figure it out or just ask me) and i call him sir for short.  That is so pimpastic!!  The only thing that pisses me off about being grounded is that i cant see any of my friends.  Especially you Rick :) hehe, you rock my world!  SERIOUSLY!  But hey, this morning when me and my mom were dropping off my brother at kids college i saw Becca hehe!!!  Well I better go.  Got some cleaning to do.  Some chillin' by myself to do.  Listen to music.  Catch up on my television.  Practice.  Maybe even read my summer reading book!  Who knows?  But I still have all phone/internet privlediges so call me or IM ME!!!! hehe Later kids.  Love, Meg

      Why do I, or should I, care any more.  I'm having fun right now, but then again I'm not.  I am not quite sure what I am trying to say.  But I cant explain it.  Or at least I cant put it into words.  Maybe I'm still mad at the world.  Mad at everything.  I feel as though I still cant get over the loss of my friend.  That was quite a while ago, two years on October 11th of this year, but it still seems as though Ricky is supposed to be here.  He didnt even die of any diseases or what not.  He just died doing what he loved, gymnastics.  He didnt even hurt himself either... What is with this world? And I never even got to say goodbye to him.  Well on top of that, I hadn't seen him in a few years since we went to seperate schools after 4th grade and he lived a while away.  So that made it even harder.  Things like this in the world make me wonder.  I wonder what our purpose of being here is, and how it came about.  The sum of it still baffles me in each and every way... I just cant seem to figure it out.  Oh well.  I think I shall go find something interesting to do, go swimming, go out with someone, get away from this lonely house.  In the mean time, you can sit here and wait for me to post again...  Seems as though I am done for now.

      Well look what I have here.  I am back up posting.  I find this thing very random at times.  I always jump from topic to topic and confuse my readers... That is, if there is any one out there that actually reads this :-/  If your still reading this... That is a good sign :)  Let's see... Tomorrow I start marching band back up.  I am quite excited.  I have been waiting for this season to start up forever.  Other than the fact that now I have something to do the rest of the summer... its all good.  And the fact that I can't do any thing tonight cuz I got home late from where I was tonight.  But that's another story.    Cuz of that, I get to wake myself up tomorrow and then go wake up mi madre.  What crap.  This whole world is crap.  Well, not actually but hey.  I just realized that I should eiher be sleeping or reading my summer reading book so, sadly enough... This mighty boring blog entery must come to an end.  Leave me comments.  :)  I want some.   I'll see some of you bright and early tomorrow.  G'nite.  Wait a sec.  (Here comes my spaztic random thoughts thanks to A.D.D. :-P)  The funniest thing tonight was when my bowling ball got stuck... more like just not coming up... Yancey started jumping and stepping all over the boards above the chute where the ball comes up.  When he began to do that it just cracked me up!  I had never seen anything like that.  You make me happy Chris, always bringing a smile to my face :) hehe.  Well Yeah, eventually the ball came up.  That was fun :D

      Oh yeah... If for some reason the Band Directors tell me not to march one day cuz they see my foot hurts, I believe I want to go watch from the tower.  I've always wanted to go up there.  Just a thought of mine.  This is random, but I believe I will try and remember to bring my camera to school on Monday.  I feel like taking pictures of friends.  Then when I finally get a good collection of pictures again, I will put them up on http://www.meganmcdonough.com  Haven't updated that in a while...  Should I sleep or no?

      Man what is with me?  I like hurt my heel really bad.    For those of you who dont know.  I jumped off the stage at the rock-a-thon and gave Kris Fortuno a high five.  But see... I was barefoot.  I like landed on my right heel somehow and hurt it really bad.  The doctor said it might be broken... or it is just fractured or severley bruised it.  And the bad part about it is he was like:  No marching band.  When he said that my mouth gaped open and I felt like my whole life was torn apart.  (not really but you marching band nerds know what i mean)  I talked to my dad a little eariler and I told him I was still gonna march.  Like most likely march on monday, then we have tuesday off, ask to sit out on wednesday or just kinda walk to my sets and not march that much then be back the rest of the time.  So I guess I'd stay off of my heel during the day and then give it my all in the two hours of marching.  My plan seems as though it will work.  Hope and pray that I dont do something stupid to make it worse and have to be out the rest of marching season.  This years show is gonna kick ass... and I duno of anyone that can learn my sets :-/

      My interesting conversation for the night:  Aznfob12: my life rocks T Rump e TEyeTIS: Sounds as though it does. Aznfob12 : until college auditions come around T Rump e TEyeTIS: True dat. Aznfob12: come on curtis! T Rump e TEyeTIS: Hehe. Aznfob12: if i get into curtis i would do something stupid T Rump e TEyeTIS: Like... Aznfob12: you think of something T Rump e TEyeTIS: I'll think for ya and get back to you on that. Aznfob12: mmky Aznfob12: i'll kick siak in the balls T Rump e TEyeTIS: Haha, and get the baby out of galloway Aznfob12: hahahaha Aznfob12: too big of a belly  Classic conversations, haha.  Here's another which had reference to a conversation Me, Rick and Eric had during summer band inside.  guitarboy713: i still cant believe guitarboy713: what you said about the trumpet guitarboy713: and the condensation T Rump e TEyeTIS: Oh hahahaha guitarboy713: i mean..i know you are dirty...i just forget guitarboy713: lol T Rump e TEyeTIS: Leftover residue guitarboy713: yeah..thats megan for ya T Rump e TEyeTIS: Haha. guitarboy713: ah, good times   Hmm... I believe now that it is 10:21, the night before school starts back up, I have finally realized that reality is not a dream.  So I must be off to bed now.  See you kids bright and early tomorrow morning.  The majority of you I will see in the band hall.

      Ever feel like your head is about to explode?  That you just want to be left alone to sit on the computer and not have any one bother you.  Well yeah.  Me too.  My parents are fucking annoying.  I have just had a tiring day and I came home from Jeff's house and wanted to be left alone.  I sat their for a while, like "la-de-da"... they will go away soon.  But no, they dont shut up and dont leave.  I finally had enough of it and started saying "pleeeeeeeeeeeease leave me alone".  "I'm tiiiiiiired."    You dont know how frusturating it can be to teach new freshman how to march.  I mean... its not their fault that they dont know how.  Just when they like sink down and petrude their hips foward, don't step off on 4 (more like step off on the and of 2...), they march like ducks, cant do what I show them to do even though I am giving it to them one on one, they lean towards the ground more with every step they take... even though I am only having them take one step and roll through.  Ah, the list goes on.    Sounds to me like I am being rude, but it just frusturates me a bit.  I mean, I was a pretty good freshman marcher and it's hard for me to see why someone cant learn something when they're pretty much having a marching "private lesson" and having me talk about every little aspect of what they are/should be doing.  Ah well.  Today was a pretty good day.  As usual I woke up around noon or so.  Got up, lounged around the house and did pretty much nothing before marching started.  Turns out that my parents were still downtown in a meeting and I had to frantically find a ride to band.  Thank god Kaitlin was able to give me a ride.  Then we had full band for the first half of band rehearsal.  "La-de-da"... The usual stuff, we ate, went outsdie and did marching fundamentals.  Then after that I was waiting for Leah so we could go to Jeff Langley's house for swimming and what not, but she and Carl had to change a 3rd bass drum head.  Hehe.  So Johnson walks in and is like "What the heck are yall doing?"  And Leah was like "Were changing a drum head."  So Mr. J decides to help and then after a while his phone rings.  Then we hear this remark somewhat like "Man, I hope she's not in labor [referring to his wife whos baby is due this month]."  He picks up his phone and we hear "Yeah, so did you call it in? Okay I'll call you back later."  My first reaction to that was OMG Mrs. Johnson is in labor and he said he'd call her back!!! But luckily it turns out she wasn't.  *Phew*  So then Johnson was like "Do yall wanna hear what Mr. Galloway did when  his  wife was in labor?"  And of course we did.  So he told.  Turns out, while Mrs. G was in labor Galloway decided to go to a job interview.  Funniest thing I have heard in a while.  Reminds me of the time 'the G man' told us that he asked his wife if all babies did was sleep, cry and crap.  Haha, crazy stuff.    *Rythm, Pitch, Son of a Bitch*  Only some know what that is.  Think ending of March from Symphonic Metamorphosis.  Well I'm off to go to bed.  Well not really.  My parents believe that I am.  I will probably end up playing solitare on my computer or something.  Maybe even come back to the computer.  Oh, and by the way.  If you wanna come swimming and play games at my house tomorrow at 12:30.  Just give me a call and drop by.

      I want to give a big applaud to John on his wonderful blog.  Man, I read that stuff and I just die laughing.  I love how he finds a way to make fun of Jeff in each entry.  I have decided that I will no longer pour my complaints out to you on this damned blog, but to keep them in my own sort of journal type thing I have on my own computer.  Football game went pretty well.  I know a few people who say they didn't do to well but I haven't watched the video so I am not quite sure yet.  My solo/duet thing in Lento kicked ass as usual.  Solo spots are so fun.  Hey Jeff and Manish, we need to talk to The G Man about what we are gonna do about poses or what not.  I still wanna do those.  On another note, this week was my week for the Vehicle solo.  I say it went quite well.  I just need to Jazz it up during the next two weeks before time rolls around for my turn again.  Maybe we can play it at a pep rally and I can bust out my stuff there for the whole school to see me in all my glory.  Hmm, I still haven't figured out if I actually have homework or not this weekend.  I better check on that before I decide to hit the sack tonight.  Freshman are silly.  And they should be banned from doing the "Ooo-ooo" thing with the drum line during one of their cadences because the screw them up.  *shakes head in disappointment*  Ah, and the cheerleaders changed the lalalalalalalala hey hey cheer, and now the drumline cant figure out what they are doing.  Making the drum like look bad... how rude.  (Just joking with anyone who took offense... The drum line will figure out what they did sooner or later)  Im out, nitey nite kids.

      As I sit here pondering, alone in the kitchen... I wonder if there is anything to look foward to for tomorrow.  Though I am a happy person, there is something lingering inside of me that I can't seem to find.  I think about it all day, what it might be and where it has come from, but there is still no answer.    Maybe I feel alone in this odd place called earth.  Or maybe I just want something to entertain me.  These thoughts usually go away when I am in the presence of my friends... or what I have of friends, because again this year... I have no classes what-so-ever with any of my friends except those of them in my 7th period class.  School hasn't been quite overwelming this year but band is taking over my life.  As much of a passion I have for music I just wish I could have a day off.  Seems as though that each year I progress in school, I keep finding the friends who are closer to me and the ones who I occasionally say 'Hey' to and not really have any significant or intelligent conversations with.  It begins to sadden me and makes me feel like I am lost in the world.  I don't know where this post is going because if I do not stop now, I feel as though it will turn into a book.  Wait no, more like a novel.  I am out for now.  Call my cell if you want to go do something tonight.  Please, I need to get my mind off of the world and go drink coffee with friends and just talk, laugh and enjoy life.

      Lately I have been trying to sort out my thoughts.  Though it does not seem to be working.    It feels like I have a huge filing cabinet with lots of papers scattered thoughout the entire room.  I decide to get started but then realize I dont have any folders to put the papers in, and on top of that... No labels for each section.    I am deeply confused in this world and I guess I should go try and find some folders and labels.  Where do you get some of those?

      Okay.  So I called Leah eariler, and I was like "Hey I'm bored."  And she told me that after she ate dinner we could go do something.  So I go on minding my own biznass both excited about my soon to occur shenanigans of the night and practicing my trumpet til she comes home.  When I think she might be almost home I go ask my mom "Hey can I go do something with Leah tonight?  I don't have any homework and theres nothing to do."  Well you'd think shed say "Sure Megan, its only like 7 30 right now.. Be back home at 9 30 - 10 like usual."  But no!  She has to give me some shit about how I had an 'attitude' last night.  That is totall bull crap.    Well for one, do you expect someone to talk nice back to someone who is talking rudely/with an attitude to them?  I think not, and good; you do too.  So you are at least on the same chapter and maybe even the same page as me in my book.  So here she goes, rambling on and on how I had this attitude last night and all I want to do is get out of the house for the main reason of her, giving me all this non-sense that really bothers me.  She was the one who had the attitude last night and always seems to be the one with the attitude and so that was my main reason for how I acted the night before.  It is so stupid too.  I was on the computer and my mom was like "Megan get off."  "Sure," I told her, "I will be off in like 5 minutes after I say bye to everyone."  Two minutes later, I am still on the computer, hence my 5 minutes I asked for is not up.  Then my dad walks into the room and my mom exclaims "What is wrong with her?  She still is not getting off that computer."  So I stand up and tell her "Well, I AM getting off the computer right now.  I'm not the one whining and complaing to dad about how im taking soooooo long to get off."    Well, yeah.  As I read over that and think about the happenings of last night I can understand why she would be mad at me, but how come I have no reason to be mad at her?  Things like this in life puzzle me, like everything else on this darn planet.  One more annoying thing and then I will stop my ranting and raving about this.  After this all occured last night, I just closed all my boxes (sorry if I didn't say 'bye' to any of y'all) and ran upstairs to my lovely room which has a lock.  I (not thinking) get in my room and shut the door and lock it.  But see... the shut of my door turned into a slam out of the adrenalin rush going through my body and anger racking every bone and organ.  So at the time my dad just so happened to be walking by.  He hears the door slam and yet again, comes and pounds on my door and slams it open so hard that the molding on the side comes off.  Therefore, now I dont really have much of a door.  Just a door that swings back and fourth with nothing to keep it shut.  Kinda sad, aye?  Furthermore, I am not quite happy with my family right now and needed to get this steam out of me.  There is more to this story but I am not going to get into details.  I still have anger fluctuating through my entire body.  This has most of it out though.  I just wish I could get away from my whole world for like a week and go someplace else, with other people (and maybe take some of yall with me, you guys know who you are) to just live the happier part of my life.    Oh well, maybe some hot tub action by my self tonight with the sounds of the leaves in the breeze and the pitter-patter of squirrels running across the ground and into the trees will soothe my thoughts and emotions.  On a higher note, I don't have homework.  So talk to me and make me happy. :)

      You know the people who always exclaim "I HATE HIGH SCHOOL!  I WANT OUT NOW!!!" ?  I can't even see why they would think that.  These are the last four years we live here with our families and close friends whom we have known since middle school, and maybe even elementary or Pre-K.  As I sit here, watching videos and looking at pictures of people I have come to realize that I really do only have 3 years left here.    All the football games, crazy shinnannigans, random trips to the mall and just being with friends are truly my best memories.  I am writing this mainly thinking about all my senior friends who went off to college this year and watching them come back and visit.  Things are so different without them, yet they still seem the same.  Take last night for example.  We were playing William Tell Overture in the stands the usual da-ga-da da-ga-da da-ga-da da-da and so on.  Then we come to the grand pause and I hear someone belt out a scream.  Matysiaks face lit up and that baffled me.  Usually Matysiak doesnt exactly enjoy hearing someone scream in the grand pause, but then I realized; It has to be Brindley.  So I turn around and just as I though, there was David standing next to the tubas.  You made my day Brindley, you really did.    Little things such as someone even just screaming, you know you will remember it for the rest of your life.  Just thinking about leaving this routine of football games, crazy stuff and so on makes me tear up.  Im not ready to leave and I know I wont be leaving anytime soon, but I guess I have come to realize that I need to treasure the time I have with my friends before they leave and make the best of it.  So, I guess what I am trying to say, is that after I graduate and start a new life I would love to live high school over again.  With all this crazyness of being a teenager, sometimes it makes life a bit easier so to say.  You dont have to work and you dont have to take care of a family, because you already have someone doing this for you.  So for all of you college freshman out there, I bid you the best of luck and you better not forget me!  Keep in touch.

      Sorry didn't quite make it clear that the information I talked about in that last entry was obtained orignally by Jeff.  http://jefflangley.blogspot.com  I just decided to talk about it a bit in my own blog because I thought it was quite interesting.  Just thought I'd make that clear with you folks.

      Just read Jeff's blog.  Quite interesting I must say.  There are studies that say when you listen to repeitive music, such as rap, it makes you stupid.  But I believe that the music does not need to be rap to make you stupid.  Take for example 'The Canyon'.  Do the band directors have a long drawn out plot against us, the students, to make the so called 'smarties' at Clements stupider?  Maybe so.  Therefore, that is probably why we are having trouble playing it.  That is, because we have heard it so many times that we know the rhythm so well, but still cant seem to play it.  Some might beg to differ with me and I agree with them.  There are some people in our band who just simply can't play it.  Maybe the music really doesn't make us stupid.  So if not... just stick to the latter... "There are some people in our band who just simply can't play it."  Ponder on that for a while smarty-pants.  Or maybe you have become stupid from The Canyon.  Don't blame me.  Blame Philip Glass.  He is coming into town soon... You can rant to him about it.

As you've probably noticed I have not updated this darn thing in a while.  Nothing quite significant to put up in here... but all is good.  Me and El Capitan went on some shinnannigans tonight, woop woop!  Hehe.  Those are so incredibly uber-fun.  If you really want to hear about it ;) Just ask me.  Oh and another thing.  Does anyone have ideas for the trumpet shirt?  I need some funny crazy/cool ideas.  Ooooooh yeah.  Tomorrow is nerd day!!!!!! YAY FOR BAND NERDS!!  I cant wait!! OOPAH!

      I, still at that stage between being a child and an adult with the outmost freedom, still seem to be confused in this little place we call Earth.  Sometimes I feel as though I do not know where I belong or who my  real  friends are.  Maybe I should be alone forever.  I find that when I am alone I am happier, and when I am with some people I just kind of sit there wishing I could be having fun.  I really dont know where I am going with this but who cares.  La-de-fucking-da.  Anger runs through my head.  I'm angry because I don't feel like some people care.  So what if they invited me... It could be just because they always have and don't want to stop.    "What are you doing?" Im just sitting here. "Oh okay." *walks off* (inner thoughts)  So they don't even care to come talk to me, comfort me, help my anger and frustrations clear out of my head.  I don't know myself.  Who am I?  Where am I?  What will I become?   I dont know what that was.  Oh well.  Game tonight.  On Halloween... How dumb.  Maybe I will practice my region music a little more before I go.

      Oh dear.  I just read what I just wrote.  Seems as though my post is another A.D.D. entry.  Oh well.  I'll try and work on that.  Too many things running through my mind at once.  Ah, and here's one of em.  Here's a come back to John for making fun of other people.  He gets to be made fun of by Megan... Haha this is quite amusing.  So you know how me and Erik always play the notes A-D-D whenever we have an ADD moment in band?  Yes, good for you.  No, well know ya do.  Well back to my story.  One day before a football game John Bridges walks up to Erik Plate and asks "Erik, what are the notes for that A-D-D thing you and Megan play?"   You will never hear the end of it John, I promise... You never will!!!

      Whoa!  Today was like the most glorious day I have had in a long time!!!  I was not able to finish my english homework last night because of my other loads of crap and I was out to the orchestra concert, but Megan has good news!  Ms. Lak talked alot today in english about her family, what she likes to do, the usual... Therefore Megan was able to finish her homework!  Well, all but one question but that doesn't matter.  That was only part of my good day.  In Mrs. Russows class, she started talking about other stuff again instead of doing the example problems with us!  For one, she was happy because they fixed the homecoming key chains (for those of you who dont know... the first time they were made, the company spelt it Cle  n  ents, haha!) and she got DirectTV last night.  Her stories are so funny!  You had to be there!  Oh yeah, and the fact that two weeks ago, the principals were telling her to get out of her t-shack and into the new one before the weekend because they would be taking the t-shack away.  But see, it is still there.  Two weeks later.  Me and my class have made a bet that it will still be there at the end of the year.  Ha.  At lunch I see Denise jump out of her seat and yell "Boxes!" and run off.  Kinda puzzled me cuz I didnt know what the heck she was talking about.  So I asked jeff and he said that the props were in!  So being me, I too bounced up and skipped down to the band hall with Leah, Denise and Thomas all excited about the boxes.  Of couse, we had to go outside and play with them, dancing in them and just having a ball!  Then we ran into the yearbook lady and she wanted to take pictures of us with them!  Turns out that the theme of the Friends section of the yearbook is called "Out-of-The-Box", so we took pictures of us "outside the boxes."  Haha!  Marching practice was okay today.  What made it worth while was seeing Matysiak and Galloway fighting with 'Siak wearing those Hulk glove things.  Too funny man, too funny.  Then in the middle of rehearsal, when Cade was tying Conrad's shoe (don't ask... I dont know) Galloway ran over there wearing the Hulk gloves as Matysiak announces on the loud speaker that he will get mad and attack them.    Great fun.  But now it is time for some homework.  Maybe I will try not to get too distracted as have been the past week or so in school for some particular reason. :-P hehe!

      Hmm... Quite bored so I feel like putting little quotes of songs I like.  "All of You is more than enough for all of me For every thirst and every need You satisfy me with Your love And all I have in You is more than enough"  "Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel? Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still? Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing 'Hallelujah!'? Will I be able to speak at all? I can only imagine! I can only imagine!"  "I want to know you.   I want to hear your voice.   I want to know you more.   I want to touch you.   I want to see your face.   I want to know you more."

      Thanksgiving break.... Hasn't been too shabbt.  I've had some time to myself and been able to lounge around.  Eariler this week I spent the night at kaitlins after going shopping and then i went to see a few movies the next day.  Quite fun I must say.  I saw Gamble and Yancey leaving my neighborhood to go on some errands one day over break and I had a nice short talk with the two of them.  It's good to see the seniors of '03.  I don't know what I am doing the rest of the break, maybe lounging around some mroe and practicing some more too.  On saturday I believe I might go to see Symphonie Fantastique with my good friend Jeff Taylor.  That will be such a good concert :)  Well I am out y'all.    Happy Food Day... Err, Thanksgiving.  Heh.

      I could not be a happier person right now!  Today in band... WE GOT OUR LETTER JACKETS!  I saw them on the ground in the boxes as I walked in and I grabbed my horn, sat down, took off my sweater I was already wearing and then tried to patiently wait for my jacket!  I must admit, that I could not sit still.  My god I almost peed in my pants waiting!    After school I went to HEB to buy some chicken soup (cuz I wasnt feeling good today) and I totally strutted my stuff going through the isles with my hands in my pockets.  Man, did I feel cool!  But then my mom suggested that we go get my patches sewn on and I *shruged* and went along with it.  It was so sad having to show the person where i want all 8 of my patches but I get it back at noon tomorrow. :)  And by the way, I wont be at school tomorrow.  GO SENIOR SKIP DAY!  Well, actually I am sick but hey I can always pretend.  I am running a fever so I'd better get to bed soon.  LEAVE ME MESSAGES AND TELL ME YOU LOVE ME!

      Whoa its raining!  It has been like all freakin day but I didnt realize it was raining til about 4th period when I had Mrs. Russow for Geometry out in the T Shacks.  So I go into her class and sit down and we do the usual worksheet or two for the day and she has the doppler radar up on the projector.  I WAS LIKE HOLY MOLY ITS GONNA RAIN BAD TODAY!    After that I go to lunch.  (I'm gonna get a little off topic here) Well, after a while of the usual lunch talk, etc... I all of a sudden hear Cat yell "COOKIE!!!"  I dont really feel like explaining stuff cuz im kinda tired but the majority of it was that Eric licked the bag with the cookie and Cat took the cookie with the bag and took out the cookie and licked it.  Meanwhile she gave it to Joanna sitting infront of me and she obviously hadnt payed any attention and she ate it.  Groos.  Hehe  Well back to what I was talking about.  Through the day I sort of forgot that it was raining until I was going down the stairs to the band hall with Jamie and Liz and Nina.  Jamie suggested playing in the rain and I was liek "YEAH THAT WOULD BE FUN!"  Ha.  Too bad we couldnt.  Hey Jamie.. Maybe another day that its raining and its not like flooding we can go play in it!!! Hehehe.  When I got home, I took some pictures of the flooding in my pool and on my street.  I though you might find that a bit amusing.  *shrugs*  I will probably write something that is more worth your while for reading later...  Or maybe not :-P  Oh and by the way.  I got my ugly band dress today.  *falls over and dies* Lol

"Tsssss, ahhhhhh" - Peter  Oh and by the way... Leah makes the best Kung Pao Chicken ever!  She is going to be my new wednesday night cook featuring her famous Kung Pao Chicken!!!!! YAY!  Man, I haven't had coffee in like 4 weeks or something liek that... and my dad brought me some home tonight and it gave me the worst stomach ache in the world.  Ahh, die die die!  Well im out for the night.  More happy posting later!!!    Oh yeah.. one more note... I WANT MY FREAKIN LETTER JACKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Out of all honesty, I really hate my life.  Nothing ever seems right.  I need something to pour all I have into...  Anything... Anything to save me from this world.  This horrid place called earth.  Normally I am most at peace when I am either practicing or in band class, because I am doing what I love.  But lately, a certian person has been making un-necessary comments to me during class.  It is quite annoying because he isn't the one who should be making comments like that.  I love music with all my heart but sometimes in class I just want to run out of the room screaming because it makes my expierence in there horrible.  Just shoot me now please.. and get it over with.

      Sitting here alone in the kitchen, I still can't sleep.  I havent exactly tried to lay down in bed to go to sleep but I just dont feel like I should be sleeping.    Many things are on my mind lately... and some of them I wish not to discuss.  Well, they aren't neccessairly bad things.  Oh, never mind.  Halloween show was a success.  The crowd loved it!  After wards me and kaitlin went trick or treating to ONE house dressed as band nerds.  Bet you cant guess who's house that was?  Ozzy took a picture of us.  Quite humorous I must say and a plus factor is that we got a bunch of candy from them.  Following that, I walked over to Ashley and Jeremy's house and watched the Ring with them.  Before the movie started, Jeremy showed me this uber cool pumpkin he carved!  It has Homestar Runner on it!  Man, that thing looked so freaking awesome.  I will have the picture of it up on my picture page soon. :)  Hmm, tonight... or should I say last night?... I went to Jack's house to watch the Matrix Reloaded with Linda, Jeff, Erik, Denise, Michael, Melissa, Kapil, David and John.  Maybe I should have seen The Matrix first.  Some of the stuff kind of blew over my head.  *woosh*  Oh well.    John as usual had a great pun last night too.  Well, if you have seen Matrix Reloaded, do you remember the part where that guy gets the spoon from the orphan?  You do?  Good.  If not, Skip over this.  Well Jack kept asking questions and talking during the movie and when it came to the scene with the spoon John said... "Jack, do we have to spoon feed the whole movie to you?"  Haha.  How does he do it... Perfect timing I must say.  Well, I believe I will try and sleep now.  This looks as though it is one of my better and more elaborate entrys.  And by that I mean I don't jump from topic to topic like I usually do.  Or at least I don't think I did.  Wow I wrote alot, g'nite.

      Well, since the new year is approaching.. I have decided to make some new years resolutions of my own.  1. Be a better friend and an all around better person. 2. Get better grades 3. Practice more 4. Save money  Those seem fairly legitimate dont you think?  I believe if I stick with that, I will be come a better person as a whole and be more fun to be around.  Things like practicing for a certain amount of time each day and getting good grades will help me get into UT.   I have gotten okay grades this year and I havent been able to practice as much as I want to.  But starting with that foundation, I believe that if I keep my priorities fairly high I can get into where ever I want.    You know, I really havent been thinking about college as much as I should.  I really should stop going on the Internet too.  That is a big time waster right there.  Amazing how things like that can suck up your time, not even letting you realize how much time you are spending on it.    Another thing, I have noticed that some of my friends I had through out middle school we dont have as much in common any more.  We started high school last year, had all different classes, never saw each other.  I kind of wish that I could relive old memories from middle school again, but I guess I really cant.  The friends I still have now understand what I am talking about.  We have sat and talked about this too, kind of sad thinking that I will not be here in 2 and a half more years, but at the same time it is very exciting.  I really cant wait.  Okay, enough of the past/future stuff.  Lets talk about now.  I really havent used this to talk about me personally.  I just sort of rant and ramble on about things that happen in my life, what funny thing happened at lunch today, or what kind of weird things I heard people say.  Big whoop.  I wish I could let more people get to know the real me.    Yeah yeah I know you are thinking to yourself, What the crap are you talking about Megan.  But once you think about it how well does everyone know each other.  Could you tell me what my favorite food is, whats my favorite color, have I lived here all my life?, when was the last time me and a member of my family got in a fight.  Dont know those answers?  Well, maybe that isnt what shows whether or not someone knows you well enough or not.  But for one, I know you cant just be an acquaintance to someone and believe you know them inside and out.  No, not just being with me when my friend died just knowing that someone is there and that they understand how you think is when you truly know someone.  Mmmkay.  I dont know where I was going with that.  Maybe its just my mind talking, and maybe by reading this you can get to know me even better than you already do.  Well I am out for now.  Later folks.

      Thank goodness.  Winter break is finally here.  Now that it is here I have absolutley no clue what to do!  I went to Laura's Birthday party last night and that was lots of fun!  Especially that word game we played, quite humorous I must say.  Then after Denise had dropped off Erik at his house and was driving out of Erik's neighborhod to take me and Thomas home... Guess what we saw!?  The two reindeers at the front of Erik's subdivision were in erotic positions.  Denise, Thomas and I were laughing our heads off.  That was just classic.  I hadn't seen something like that in a long time.  :-P  Maybe I should have a party sometime over break... Like before Christmas.  That would be uber fun.  I could heat up the pool and hot tub.  Mmm, sounds good.  Well, I haven't much else to say.  Leave me comments!  OOPAH!

      Man.. Schoolhas liek actually been fun lately.  But of course I usually either have the most fun in band or lunch.  Today I think those two were at a close tie.  At lunch Cat got a christmas gift from one of her friends and she didnt finish opening it up so Katy Kemp and I peeked in to see what it was and i was like "Oh my gosh!  I love Love Spell!!!"  And then I turned to Erik and said "Don't you just love that too?"   But of course the answer was no because of the fact that last year I sprayed it in his hair and like all over him and Galloway walks in the band hall and exclaims, "Man, it smells in here."  And I pointed to Erik.  Hehe.  Good times.  Then in band Matysiak walked in the room right before the brass started playing so he could remind us that we ahve a clinic with Mr. Bennet after school on Monday.  Then Cade shouted out, "I will have to leave early because I am getting staples out of my head."  In regards to that, Matysiak said, "Okay Cade... I will be sure to bring an extra pair of staple removers to class and I will do that for you right here."  Yet again... more good times.  Although I want to get out of high school so bad, I know I will miss it.  The crazy times, crazy conversations.. the people I've met.  Things will never be the same after high school and I guess I might as well live it to the fullest right now and have all the fun I can! (I think I say this kinda stuff too much.)  Well, today I also got to go driving again.  I believe I have driven for like a total of 4 hours or something this week.  It is so awesome.  I swear my mom seems like she is going to pee her pants sometimes when I drive.  Ha, cuz she just kinda sits there and I can do whatever I please.  I find it quite amusing that when I drive with her in the car I decide what I am going to do and then my mom is like.. No, do this... halfway into me already doing something.  i.e. U turn on Palm Royale.  *shrugs*  It amuses me.  Man that reminds me of when she almost had me go down University Blvd. until I told her that there were no U turns in the middle of it.  Cuz we had gotten right over the bridge and I was liek mom... you cant make a U turn here and I am not going down there yet.  And she was like "Ok.  Make a U-turn here."   Boy do I love breaking the law!  Ha, I accidentally ran a stop sign in Commonwealth cuz my mom wouldnt stop talking and I was too occupied trying to get her to shut up.  There's some of my thoughts for now.  Time to do more Exam reviewing.  hehe, maybe I should work on my favorite class... Music History!

      I know, I said this like on Monday... but yet again my life is going good.  I made region :) and I go to phase 2 on Saturday.  I didn't do as well as I think I can because I got a bit nervous at the beginning.  I hope that I make a way better chair on Saturday! Heh.  Well, right now I am watching tv and I just ate pizza.  Yum.  Now that my stomach is satisfied... it almost is saying, "Thank you!"  Hah.  I am enjoying myself quite too much right now.  After school I was informed that Jeff Langley was accepted into the Madison Scouts!  GO JEFF!    I don't have much more to say, right now.  Kinda bored ;) talk to ya later.

Hmm, well I must say my life is going exactly how I want it to at the moment..

      Finally.  I got my midwest patch.  And now all I have to get is my region patches this weekend... then I can go get them sewn on.  This is quite exciting I must say.    Not much else to say but the fact that my life is going perfect right now.  Perfect in every little way.  I love you Saunders.

      Yesterday I spent my afternoon through about 10 15 with my favorite person in the whole wide world!  :-D  Saunders came over and we played NCAA Football for a while, then my mom came upstairs and asked us to help take the million ornaments off the tree and help take the tree down.  Not like we could tell her no or anything.  But it ended up being alot of fun!  We watched tv while taking down the ornaments and we got to look at a bunch of the really cool ones!  Hehe. See, my tree is really tall and I cant reach ones at the way top... even if I am at the top of the ladder and so I had Saunders get them.  Ha, it is helpful having tall people like him around.  Hehe.  Like that time you got that shirt down for me from way up high at the mall!  Good times!  Well back to what I was really talking about.  So after a while of taking down ornaments and stuff we ate dinner.  Mmm, ravioli is sooo good!  Then we went back to finish taking off ornaments and stuff after dinner and then finally took down the tree.  That was so much fun!  Hanging out with you just totally makes my day, and you make me feel so incredible!    Well I am a bit busy at the moment.. finishing up homework and chatting on aim.  So I will update some more later :)

      I bid all of you a fond farewell.  That is because this might be my last blog entry ever.  You know when your life has skyrocketed?  When for once it just seems so perfect?  Wether you can or can't relate to what I am talking about just listen to this.  Lately my life has seemed as though it  is  perfect.  In all respect it still is, but what I was informed of when I got home made it plummet.    No, I have not buried myself in a hole deep under ground from the rest of the world.  But yes, my dad is finally sick of the internet and he threatned to take it out of the house completley.  I do not believe he is joking either.  I also just had to go over on my cell phone bill last month, and that will be taken away until I pay him back.  (No it is not another $429.99 bill.)  The total is like 84 dollars and a random ammount of cents.    Guess I'd better go and do homework right now.  If this goes through and I don't have internet any more... I will miss all of you dearly.  For now, I hope, this is goodbye.

      Man.  Today in band we didnt do anything at all!  Matysiak talked liek the whole period and we only did warm ups (thats nothing un-usual).  But I heard something really funny!  Keith English came and talked to us about the Blinn band and stuff and afterwards he was discussing how most colleges you get the same thing out of it.  And then he was talking about that everyone that goes to clements... if they do well while they are here, college will be a breeze for them.  Unles of course they are partyers, then they wont pass college and they will flunk out.  Then he said, "Oh wait.  Mr. Galloway graduated."    Ha, sorry that was random but it was something funny from today.  Oh yeah.  One more funny thing.  We were doing remington and Mr. Matysiak asked some question to Eric Marfin.  Dear god that was fucking hilarious.  "Like you see like its like the G-sharp and the like um, well like F-sharp...." mumbled Eric Marfin.  "I dont know about any of ya'll but I didn't understand a word he just said!" exclaimed Matysiak moving on to ask someone else the question.  "Erik Plate do you know?"  "When the intrevals get further apart it becomes more out of tune" said Erik.  Marfin just has his own way of saying things.  We still love ya though!  And we know what you meant.  (At like least liek we will liek tell like you that.)  Omit the "likes" to translate from Eric Marfin language.  Whoo.  Enough of that.  I am out!

      Hmm, I feel as though I am a bit home sick right now.  Sometimes I would rather just sit at home and do nothing, or be in the presence of my friends.  Yes, I do enjoy coming and visiting my relatives... but when I just sit here and don't do anything I realise I could be in the comforts of my own home and my own town at that moment.  It makes me wish I could have just stayed home.  Last night, it was hard for me to sleep.  For one, I dont like going to bed early but I had to. :-/  That was a bit harder than I thought it would be.  Especially because of some factors.  First of all I miss someone like crazy right now.  It was hard to leave him at home.  Then my dad.  Oh dear.  He snores like no other.  Sounds like snot is stuck up all in his nose and he is really loud too.  So that didn't help either.  So I guess at about one I finally drifted off into a peaceful slumber.  But then guess what, I wake up at 3:20 to... My dad snoring.  I got up, walked around and tried to think of something to help me get to sleep.  Didn't work, so I layed down again.  Of course, I fell asleep again.  But guess what else happened?  At around 5:25, I hear whining.  Whining and crying.  You are probably wondering (well if anyone actually reads these...) what or who is whining and crying.  Yes, you guessed it.  My brother's puppy.  Of course because I was homesick and not in that deep of a sleep I was the only one who heard it.  I got up, picked Georgia up out of her cage, fed her food and water and tried to get her to go potty and then finally back to sleep.  What an eventful night.  I hope tonight is not nearly as crazy.  *sigh*  I need something to do right now.  Seems as though I am a bit bored.  I wish I could have ran to the book store before I left Sugar Land and bought Les Miserables.  Maybe Wal-Mart would have it.  Hmm.  Well, I am just counting down the days til I can get home, even though 2 days after that I have to go to school.  Hmm, how about an adendum on those New Years Resoultions of mine.  I believe I am going to stop drinking cokes.  Well, soda in general.  Those things are like an addiction and I really need to stop drinking them.  So far this year I have been good and I haven't had one.  I've thought about it but I just changed my mind to water when I thought about it.  Not that bad actually.  I will probably get to the point where I have one ocassionally, but not yet.  Need to get my self un-addicted... if that is even possible.  I believe it is.  Don't really know where this entry is going but I found I feel better after I get my thoughts out by typing them in this blog of mine or writing in my kick-ass journal I bought at Barnes and Nobles.    I am out.  I am going to be in Arkansas until Sunday.  Me and my family will leave sometime Sunday morning to drive home.  It's about a 10 hour drive, which includes all the pit stops for food and what not.  So it really should be 8 - 9 hours.  But oh look, I am rambling again.  Oh well.  Later folks.

      Today was the first day of a long string of coming home to an empty house.  You know what?  Some people would call me crazy, but I really don't like the fact that I am coming home to an empty house.  Not at all.  It's just not the same.

      I just got back from John's party.  I must say that it was an exceptionally fun party.    The funniest moment of the night probably was when we were all up in John's room about to play trivial pursuit and me and Laura were sitting on John's bed.  John walks up out of nowhere and stands next to me and all of a sudden puts his hand on my knee.  I was sitting there thinking, "what in the world..." when John all of a sudden realizes that I was not Laura.  He said he saw the brown hair and assumed it was her.  Quite funny I must say, considering the fact that he exclaimed, "You're not Laura!!!" ... after realizing it was me.   That gave myself a good 5 minute laugh, and while doing so, I banged my head on the top of his bunk bed.  Well, that's all for now.  I am a bit sleepy.  Good night.

      Well hello again.  I haven't blogged in quite a while... so it seems.  Let's give a quick update.  School is gay, I must say so myself.  Not like it's hard or anything, I just find that I am getting even more bored with school each and every day.  We go to school and do practically the same thing every day.  I swear some days... if I didn't have people to see between classes and people to talk to at lunch, I would go insane.   You know what else bugs the crap out of me?  THe fact that school has trained us like dogs.  How have they done that you ask?  Well think about it.  Everyone hurries their little butts off to get to class on time before some silly little bell.  Then we sit their anxiously awaiting the next bell so we can get up and try and get to our next destination before the bell rings, yet again.  Mkay.  Enough of that.  You know what?  My life seems as though it is absolutley perfect right now.  I am not even exaggerating to the least bit.  It is all because of one person too.  That person is Saunders.  You mean the world to me baby and you make me so happy.  Being with you is so much fun, and we have the grandest of times when we spend time with eachother.  You are never not on my mind and I cant get enough of it.  Life with you makes perfect sense... it really does.  This has been the best month (well almost a month) of my life.  Words can't explain how I feel for you Saunders and I hope this lasts forever :-D  I love you!

      Okay.  I need to start making this blog more... happy.  It has been quite negative as of late.  Ha, after school I forgot to find a ride home from someone and I was trying to hurry out to the parking lot and yoink a ride from someone... then when I get out there, I realize I can ride the bus.  w00t!  Rode it for the first time since 7th grade today!  Well today after school, Leah and Denise came over and we made Kung Pao!!!  It was uber good too!  Mmm, I just love the taste of it *mouth waters.*  :)  Soo good.  Then I made my ever-so-famous chocolate sauce for dessert.  By the way, if you have never had my chocolate sauce you should really come over and have me make it for you!  You will want more and more and more!!! Yummy.  *drool drips on keyboard*  Well, while we were making Kung Pao we were going to watch The Secret Garden but somehow my remote in the kitchen has been lost and therefore, we cannot watch VHS tapes!!! NOOO!  Boo on that!  As I posted on the Clever Campaign Chat thing, I think we should pull an April Fools joke on Matysiak tomorrow.  It would be so funny to scare him like that.  Say we just not go to band and come in 5 minutes late and say we are quitting.  Then he will look at all of us and be like "Oh my gosh, what has my world come to!?"  Then we will walk out the door and casually walk in a little while later yelling "April Fools!!!!"  Ha, like that will ever happen... but it is a good thought.  Maybe we should plan something for next year. ;)  Well, time for me to close this up.  This has probably been one of my more successful entries in quite a while.  No negative thoughts, all happy :)  and more just like thoughts of my day and not inner anger.  I feel this will be good for me.    This is Megan E. McDonough signing off... over and out.

      I have not updated in quite a while, so bear with me because I will probably just be rambling to release some stress off my back.  Life to me right now, seems utterly perfect.  There is nothing that worrys me and I seem to be more on top of things.  Procrastination has flown out my window, and I'm not going to stop the car to merely walk back to get it.  Now I am able to be lackadaisical and laugh at people who have to do things at the last minute.  Also, I seem to always have a smile on my face whether or not I show it.  I can remember a time when I dreaded waking up in the morning for the sole reason that I did not wish to go out and live life.  Those times are bad memories and now that I have come up from that low dip in life... I plan to stay on this high hill for quite a while.  Well, I need to get to my homework right now, but I will finish this entry later.  There is not much else I can say because I am at a loss for words.  Not like anyone reads this though...

      Do you know what it feels like to love and be loved in return?  Love (n.) - A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.   To me, that is just a dictionary definition because love means much more to me than that.  It is what gets me up in the morning.  It is what races through my head, day and night.  By far, love is the best feeling in the world.  Love to me, in the relationship matter, means that you share a special, unbreakable bond between you and that significant other.  That bond is held together with the feelings you get from that other person and the feelings you give them.  You put trust into one another and everytime you see them happy you are happy.  Every time you see them sad, you become sad as well.  They are someone who you are attracted to, not only for what they look like, but for who they are inside.  For me, I am in love with Saunders Lin.  He is the joy of my life, and I couldn't ask for anyone or anything else.  Never have I felt so happy all the time.  Each night I go to bed thinking of him and I wake up each morning still thinking of him.  This love I have is everlasting and nothing can break it.    I just pray to God that he can help keep this strong, and I thank him every day for the times I get to spend with Saunders.    Saunders, you truly make my life complete and I dont know where I would be without you.  "I don't know where I'd be without you here with me life with you makes   perfect   sense you're my best friend."

      Starting today, I have begun a new routine.  It consits of how I do things when I get home from school.  I know, corny, but it has to be done.    No, I am not doing this to bring up my grades (well actually that sort of has something to do with it) but this 6 weeks was higher than any other 6 week this year thus far.  I have decided that much buckling down is needed and I am not just going to think about doing it, as I do with my other list of ideas, but I am going to actually come through with it.  So far it is working out extremely well.  My plans are that I get home in the afternoon, wether it is after sectionals or right after school, and take about an hour break.  During that hour I am allowing myself to do whatever I please, except homework.  It will get my mind off of school for a while.  Then after that hour has concluded, I begin to do homework.  You folks know how that goes.  Then when I am halfway through my work I give myself a 30 minute "Talk on the phone/aim break".  After that I conclude my studies and then talk on the phone or aim (or whatever) and go to bed at about 9:30.  *This is really only for my thoughts folks, but I decided I might share it with all of you*  And well look at the time.  It's 9:30, I talked on the phone and said good night to Saunders :) and I have finished studying for my two tests tomorrow (which so happen to be in History and Geometry) and I completed all my retarted homework.  Things in my life seem to be going quite well as a matter of fact.  There is one person right now that seems to just make my life go perfect.  When I am in their presence everything feels right and I haven't felt this happy in quite a while.  Mind you people, I might have  seemed  quite happy, yes indeed, at school but I might not have been on the inside.  Right now I can truly say that I haven't felt angry (well except for little stupid things liek everyone does) in such a long time.  Saunders, this 2 months on Friday have been the happiest 2 months of my entire life.  I wish I would have known all this 13 years ago in toddler class ;)  Wow, that seems like such a long time ago.  And it was.    As I sit here realizing how fast time is flying by... I realize that I am truly going to miss this years seniors.  Y'all are such fun people and I am really going to miss you.  But we've still got 3 months of band hell to deal with right?  Right.  Well, this time.. I am really off to bed.  Enough of my rambling.  I've needed to  really  write in here for a good while.  Good night and have sweet dreams kids.  Ooooh one more thing!  I can't wait to go see The Passion of Christ this Sunday!!!!!  EEEE!!!

       You Raise Me Up Lyrics by Josh Groban   When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;  When troubles come and my heart burdened be;  Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,  Until you come and sit awhile with me.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be.   There is no life - no life without its hunger;  Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;  But when you come and I am filled with wonder,  Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be.   You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;  You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;  I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;  You raise me up: To more than I can be.

      I think I just had the absolute worst Jamba Juice drink I have ever had.  The Berry Lime Sublime had too much of something in it.  That was totally a new worker that mad my drink.  And I bought a power too... Dang.

      Is all this crap we do in high school, in reference to the GPA game, really worth the effort?

      Well, today was quite an eventful day.  I woke up and worked on my music history paper.   I dont liek that thing.  Then Saunders came over and we hung out at my house and what not.   After that we went downtown to the Wortham Center to hear Kacy sing!  OMG SHE WAS SO GOOD!!!  hehe.  Then we went with James and her to the Aquarium for dinner and we rode the Ferris Wheel.  Those are damn fun ;)  If ya know what I mean.  And then we came home, end of story.  Lol.  Yesterday, I recieved some bad news.  I'm not sure that I really wanted to hear this but, my grandpa has lung cancer.  I dont really think that the reality of it all has sunk in fully, but he has like 3 golf ball sized tumors in his lungs.  One in the right and two in the left.  He probably doesn't have long to live and I know this is going to take me down a hard road but that's life, right?    I mean yeah, I have never had a family member die.  The only thing like that that had ever happened to me was in 8th grade when my friend Ricky died.  That was by far one of the hardest things to ever deal with in my entire life.  I just hope and pray that I will be able to go see him before he dies (if he doesn't get through it... I know thats bad but yeah, I wanna see him).  Because I never got to see Ricky before he died and it still hurts.  Enough of this depressing talk.  I'm out.  Leave your thoughts please.

      Quote of the day: "I'd wake up right next to him." - Eric Marfin... in reference to Matysiak telling Locascio that he would call him and wake him up tomorrow morning since he did not know what time 2nd period started.  Classic, just classic.  But a disturbing thought too.  What are those two doing?

      Right now, I am so darn sick of people.  You know how there are people you seem to get along with and people you dont seem to get along with at all right?  Well, those people I dont get along with are getting extremely annoying.  I just want to stuff a sock in their mouth so I dont have to hear them talk.  Maybe I am just not much of a people person or something.  I dont know.  But I am getting fed up with people and their rude/stupid remarks.  So fuck you.  Life sucks... except for the one person who makes mine a million times better.  That is all I have to say for now.  Homework calls.

      Weeee!!! No more school this week!!!  Dallas trip is tomorrow!  Man, we did really well at pre-UIL today... In my opinion.  Really good for never running our whole program through.  I did okay on my solos... but I'll do better tomorrow, dont worry!  Well, I'm gonna go.  Nothing much to write in here.  If you need me this weekend give me a ring on my cellphone.  And if you have to go to school tomorrow... "SUCKS TO YOUR ASSMAR!"

      Man, that weekend sure was fun.  Felt really long... but that's a good thing isn't it?  Well, I am uber excited about our band trip this weekend!  NO SCHOOL ON FRIDAY!  *eeee*  Me and my roomies are gonna have such a blast!  Were gonna bring tons of junk food and we ain't gonna share wit j00!!!    Wee.  I am in an uber good mood today.  I didn't do anything at all in school.  Lets see... Took some notes on Jazz in music history... watched a video in music history... sat and watched ANOTHER video in world history... checked work in spanish and kinda sat there talking to the kiddos around me... in geometry i did some packet for TAKS which took me 5 minutes and we watched another video too!!!! But this one was the sonogram of MRS RUSSOWS BABY!!!  It is soo adorable!  The movie was one of those 3D ones and stuff, and it opened it's mouth and sucked it's thumb!! I LOVE LITTLE CUTE BABIES!!!  Umm, english... we did some career survey thing in the computer lab and that was kinda pointless for me since I already know quite a few colleges I want to apply for, and what I want to major in.  Then in bio we did some packet (which I finished) and we got our Rat Practical grades back!!!! YAY 93!!!! GO MEGAN!! :-D  I guess that is enough for now... maybe since I dont have any homework I can convince my mommy to take me to the grocery store and buy food... and maybe go to the mall.    Ooooh, by the way... Me and Saunders went to the mall this weekend and he picked me out an outfit!! It is uber cute!!  Here's what he picked out for me!     It's uber cute!!! And I am gonna wear it on Saturday in Dallas!!!!  Yippie!  I never get any posts, boo... it makes me sad when I dont get them.  Well, I'm out for now.  C ya!

      Read this... Sad story indeed.  http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1066425.htm  Funniest part of that article is:  They did not realise anything was wrong until they were baffled by a  "reaction in the lower half of his body"  whenever he watched pretty women on TV, the paper said.  Geez... Poor girl, I mean boy.

      I am so excited.  School is almost out.  6 more weeks of this school crap and then it is summer again!  Hooray.  Has anyone else thought that this school year went by even quicker than the last?  Because it seems that each and every day gets shorter and shorter.  Oh well, maybe I am doing something that is pre-occupying myself.  Rat practical tomorrow, I am scared yet I feel as though I will do extremely well.  I have been studying for this ever since I got home... and I probably will study for it sparadically until I go to bed.  Anyone going to Battle of the Bands tomorrow?  I assume it will be good.  Mrs. Russow said that one of her students claimed that the best way to get people to go to the Battle of the Bands is to tell them Eric Marfin will be in it.  I agree.  Do you?  Well, I am not quite sure what I am doing this weekend, but I want to go do something fun.  If anyone has ideas.. give me a ring.  Bowling maybe?  That sounds fun.  I'm out.  I'll post more later.

       Long time no blog.   Well, I haven't really posted in quite a while because quite frankly I think I bore my readers.  But then I remember, oh yes that is ultimatley beyond the point of blogging.  So going to the actual point of blogging... here are my thougts as of late.  Tomorrow is my birthday, and I am really excited!  16!!!  Watch out, here I come!  And as means of birthday parties or whatever, I believe I will have mine 2 weeks from now after my drum major camp and after I go visit my grandpa in florida who isn't doing too well.  So yeah, those things are a bit more important than a party to me right now.  Plus, I get to go to Disney World with my cousins while in Florida!  Whoopie.  For now I shall close this post because my dog peed on my bed and I am in dire need of some food.  Later haters.

      Saunders left for Taiwan this morning and I have 18 days to myself; to do whatever I please.  I don't have a clue what I am going to start with.  Maybe I can re-do my room like I was planning on this summer.  It is also a big mess too, egads!  Or maybe I should go running or something in that respect.  Oh yeah, and I am going to practice like a mother because I want to do good at Region/Area... and possibly All-State if I put my mind into it.  I already practiced for a little while today and I am planning on putting in a few more practice sessions unless I find something else to do.    Call my cell if you wanna go do something sometime.

      Lately I have been keeping a written Journal of my thoughts and I have been writing in there every day since June 18.  Hard to believe huh?  Since I am bad about updating my blog and all.  Let me tell you about my day.  Today at around 11:30 my mom trys to wake me up.  I remember her telling me she was going to the Galleria and wouldn't be back for a while.  Simply I nodded my head okay, and when she left the room... I rolled over in my bed and went back to sleep.  Continuing to sleep until around 2 or so, I am awakened by a familiar cell phone ring.  I open my eyes and think, "Oh, that is Saunders' ring..."  then I realize what I had just thought and rummage around for my cell phone, luckily answering it before it was done ringing.  Finally, my mom comes home from the Galleria and Saunders and I decide to go out and do stuff.  We take my moms car and after a few errands we decide to go see Dodgeball.  Hilarious movie I tell you, but whoever wrote it must be a boring person.  I mean a movie about dodgeball?  Haha.  We go back to my house and then decide we are hungry and want to eat Chick-fil-a for dinner.  On the way there I sang along to my Les Misrables CD enjoying myself.  So we walk in to Chick-fil-a arguing whether or not he would let me pay for myself... and he won, I couldn't pay and we go up to the cashier just to see Jason Chow!  Man, I hadn't seen him for so long.  It was quite a surprise to see him.  Jason and I talked for a bit while he took our order and he of course asked how my music history final was.  And I told him that it was very easy, and he laughed because everyone knows that it wouldnt be graded hard since I was the only one taking it.  Hmm, I think that is all I really did today.  My mind just went blank.  "At the end of the day..." *sings*

      I too am going along with peer pressure.  1. When and how did we meet? 2. What's the fondest memory you have of me? 3. Physically, what stands out? 4. Emotionally, what stands out? 5. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 6. Describe me in one word. 7. What was your first impression? 8. Do you still think that way about me now? 9. What makes me happy? 10. What makes me sad? 11. What reminds you of me? 12. If you could give me anything what would it be?  Answer these if you dont mind.  Sorry again.

      I haven't posted in quite a while huh?    Florida bored me because all we did was go out to eat Italian food.  I love Italian food, but when that is all you eat for a week and you are trying to eat healthy... it just doesn't mix.  Yeah...  So after that I went to Steubenville which was totally awesome!!!  :)  I had the greatest time too.  I really dont know what else to say cuz I am a bit tired so I will post a picture for your viewing.  Hopefully I'll post again soon.  Or maybe not.    But, I assure you I will post just for Cat when she goes off to college!!
