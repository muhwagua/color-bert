      I AM FREE, FREE AT LAST!    Yes people, I have freed myself from the bonds of slavery that is church secretary HELL.  Today was my last day because I just up and quit!  Couldn't take it until Friday.  For those uninformed, my now former boss (YES!) is an excellent example of everything a manager, and dare I say pastor, should NOT be.   The final straw?  Having him call my doctor to verify a visit (after I gave him a note) and try to ask WHY I was there!  Isn't think a violation of my privacy?  Can we say Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder?  This man cannot keep a secretary.  Granted most were fired, but there have been 7 secretaries in this one position in three years.  I get the prize for staying the longest.  Instantly, because I have a new job, I must lie about going to the dentist for a root canal in order to get a vacation day from work?  I think I could come up with a more believable excuse!!  But anyway, I start my new job Wednesday.  Tomorrow... a much needed day of rest and relaxation... and more opinions.  Later!

      Wow!  I forgot I had this thing, not that anyone reads it anyway.  So, I was free, started a new job, quit the new job and now I am in search for a new one! (Boy was that a run-on!)  Anyway, life is life...  Sucks but oh well.  Can't do much about that now can I?  I am sitting here today wondering if anyone else is as tired as I am of listening about all this war stuff.  My husband is addicted to CNN, so when he is home this is all we watch (I don't get to EVER watch what I want... Men are so stupid).  They keep talking about the same thing over and over again, just written slightly different so it sounds new and interesting.  UGHH!  I must escape this CNN hell... Later!

      So, you know all those times you call whatever division of the government on a Friday, thinking that you will reach a human who will supposedly be able to help you, yet you instead hold the line until finally in anger ridden angst you beat the phone back onto its cradle crying sarcastically, "What does no one work on Fridays?"  I have news... the answer is yes.    So I arrived at work for my normal time to a desolate parking lot.  There were maybe 20 people in the entire building cursed with working today -- most of them are the builders charged with making all the racket .. I mean building the new training room right next to my office.  Another "guvment" quirk -- the US government uses the moo for computing almost exclusively.  Yes that's right, Gateway is the computer of choice for the US government.  So all those who made fun of  my Gateway laptop purchase: mainly Ted's co-workers -- here's a big fat  ;-p  for you!  I wonder if it has anything to do with recycled parts... government agencies are also required to  buy as much recycled stuff as possible.  This includes stuff I've never heard of and things that kind of scare me -- like recycled motor oil -- doesn't sound like something good for the vehicle really.  On to other stuff... I read today that Sucralose (Splenda) is like majorly toxic.  Causes food poisoning like symptoms in all these people who complained on this "natural" foods website.  This type of irrational behavior is really getting on my nerves.  I got a clue though... When I was in Biology 1 at LSU, our prof talked about Olean -- you know the ingredient in those fat-free chips which were all the craze a few years back.  Oddly enough, you don't see any of those around anymore -- must have been the anal leakage... Anyway, how Olean works is much like fiber... scientist genetically mutated the "fat" protein complex to something unrecognizable by the body so our digestive systems won't digest it.  Hence, the cramping and other nasty side effect.  "Well duh!" my brain screams.  Artificial sweetners utilize the same idea, don't they.  People who are overly sensitive to things like this shouldn't use it.  Now I personally have never experienced any side effects with saccharin, aspartame or sucralose... Am I alone in this?  Okay enough bitching about whiney people... I must mention that Ted thinks I am complaining about him at this moment... something about not overdoing my haircut next week.  I had to gently explain to him that the cut and the style are included in one price.  MEN!  Hee hee....  Trying to convice my husband to begin his own blog.  He's decided to open with a discussion of the sodomy law supreme court ruling...  My husband is weird.  Must go and call my mother about tomorrow.  Until next time...

      Cool... signed into blog today and was welcomed with this beautiful new layout...very impressive.  Thanks to Magnum Matt for telling me about HaloScan!    Soooo... I've been working for the "guvment" for almost a week now.  I've spent most of this week taking Web based training courses that I don't need so I can double check quizzes before I rewrite them into the XML Quiz Editor.  Boy, does the government like those acronyms.  I distinctly remember this former work mate, who was in the National Guard, telling me this, but I thought it was only the military.  Uh -- no!  Seriously, you can read several sentences... paragraphs even... made up of numerous acronyms.  CGI, CQI, PSI, IRMAs... I could go on and on!  Do I even remember what any of it means?  No, but fortunately the only one I need to remember is PQE -- Plateau Question Editor.  Four weeks and counting until the end of the Summer semester and my final freedom from undergrad work!  Midterms were this past week.  For those who don't know I am taking 6 hours split between Tuesday and Wednesday night.  On Tuesdays, I am taking a Political Science course -- The Politics of War, which I need to graduate.  On Wednesdays, I take and Environmental Poetry class, which I definitely do not need to graduate... Yes, I am taking a class for fun.  I am such a dork!  So anyway, the week was filled with the midterm exam for poli sci and the first half of my journal for the lit thing.  We studied Emily Dickinson this week --- which if you don't know -- loves to use --- the dash--- !  My mom is coming into town for no reason at all.  We are going to test the new grill out with some chicken leg quarters, salmon and maybe a few Ribeyes (mmm.. steak!).  Next week is the fourth and Ted and I are looking for any excuse not to go to the Northshore for a LeBlanc family celebration.  Anybody doing fireworks or something??    The Aveda trip has been set... One week from today, I will be sporting a new "do"!  I've earned my first reward... everyday I notice a little bit more missing... which is a good thing!  Hopefully, I will earn some new clothes (because  mine are too big!) by my birthday next month!  Speaking of birthdays... Ted's is coming up soon.  More info on the coming soon...  Sorry to be cryptic, but I'm planning a surprise and Ted reads this every once in awhile.  And finally, I visited the new and improved unofficial CKI website today...  Lets say... OVAL A -- OCTOGON K? I haven't said much about CKI in awhile, but I'll give my prediction now --- if Kiwanis doesn't squash Circle K like the pest it thinks the organization is, then Circle K International will do a fine job of it themselves!  And they wonder where the money goes....  But alas, I am far over the ridiculous political bullshit that one suddenly becomes enlightened with as they age.  I still believe in the organization and what it can do for college students... hell I am trying to start an Alumni Association for christ's sake!  But enough with the stupid polical shit already!  Okay, allow me to take a deep breath and relax here.  Don't want to go too far of the deep end with that tangent!  Gotta jet for now.  Until next time....

      Began the new job yesterday.  It's great!  I have my own office and pretty much work at my own pace without anyone looking over my shoulder.  Of course the down side is the construction going on, but that can easily be ignored.  I've already obtained a strong grasp of the question editting software; however tomorrow I get to take an online meeting/course with an instructor in New York.  It feels real good to be doing "real" work.  In other news, I've lost some weight.  Already my clothes are beginning to fit slightly looser.  I can't wait to hit my first "mimi-goal" of 10 lbs. in weight loss!    I've also decided to begin posting my writing on my blog... seems like a great place to practice!  I'd love to hear responses, so please email me with comments... (How do you do the whole shout-out thing???)  Here is today's entry:   Diamond Eyes   There you are my diamond eyes, Winking, blinking, flirting from your celestial bed. You watch from on high And you speak without saying a word. You are not a mere number, Catalogued by human scientists. Your power cannot be defined by a name. Pitiful is even my guess at your own personality. For all the most intelligent upon Earth,  You are most wise in your age. You have seen the coming and going of many a realm. You speak, I listen. You listen if I need to speak. Great advisor, great listener, most wise body. F  A    L      L        I         N           G Goodbye, friend.

      Okay, I took the Friends quiz and I came out as:     urlLink      I'm Monica Gellar-Bing from Friends!   urlLink Take the Friends Quiz here.   created by  urlLink     urlLink stomps  .        I  hate to mention this, but I'm not really into Friends, but when I do watch it, Monica is my favorite character so I guess this is a good fit.  What can I say, I have the attention span and memory to watch movies sometimes, but I'm more of a reading and writing kind of chick.  Well, today is the official last day at Magnolia Marketing.  It's weird because I am having all these security checks going on for the new job.  Oh yeah, I will be working at a prime terrorist target, that's for sure!  There are two armed guards at the gates and metal detectors... and of course the pre-employment security checks.  They need proof of citizenship before I can walk around the building unescorted.  Go figure.  Anyways, Atkins is going well.  I don't find myself craving sugar so much, but I am having a hard time resisting temptation when it is offered.  Ugh, someone brought donuts today.  And the birthday cake a few days ago.  My goal for the next week is to strenghten my resolve.  Of course, it will help that I am getting out of the most snackingest office in the world!  I hope to be several pounds lighter by Tioga... maybe you won't even recognize me ;-)  Until then....

      As most people know, I currently work at a liquor distributorship in New Orleans.  My position, which will end this Friday, was charged with creating a database of wine lists from all the local area restaurants.  Let me say, there are some pretty entertaining wine brands out there.  Tell me, would anyone like a glass of Fat Bastard Chardonnay.  Perhaps a little wine from Domaine de Vieux Telegraphe (Yes, that does translate to Land of the Old Telegraph).  The best is Toasted Head... mmmm..  Combined with the entertainment of French wine chateaus, is the taste testing.  Yes, I did say taste testing.  So sitting at work doing shots of new liquor, I decided it would only be fair to report what's good (and not so good) on the market today.  Coming soon, we have Amaretto and Coffee flavored tequila.  The coffee tequila is VERY, VERY good, definitely a suggested buy.  It tastes like good espresso or cappucinno with a little kick.  Don't bother with the Amaretto flavored tequila... it tastes like tequila, plain and simple, so those who prefer amaretto sours and amaretto and pineapples won't like it at all.  Already on the market is the Bacardi flavored rums -- Coco (coconut), Razz (raspberry), Vanila (Vanilla), O (orange) and Limon (lemon).  Yummy!  Try Bacardi Razz with sprite for a nice alcoholic spritzer kind effect.  Very refreshing and easy to drink.  Razz lemonade is also a good choice (Bacardi Razz, Sour Mix and Sprite).  Most of these make pretty good flavored martinis as well. The 750ml bottle is between $11 and $17 dollars.  Also a good try, if you can afford the $20 - $30 price tag, is Hypnotiq.  A good mixture of upscale liquors and fruit juices, drink it straight over ice.  It name delivers because this is a VERY relaxing drink.  In other venues, Kahlua has a new higher proof liquor out.  Same Kaluha, just 70 proof instead of 40, so no big deal there.  DO NOT try Skyy Citrus, tastes like really nasty cough syrup.  It may be passable in cranberry juice, but I strongly doubt.  We went to Home Depot to get the grill yesterday.  We were lied to!  i was told Sunday that they 1) had them in stock and 2) could hold them until we got there Monday evening.  So when we arrived, we were told they were sold that morning (we were also told they were sold a week ago) and that the employee should not have told us that.  Okay, great.  Well, we still got a grill.  We ended up with a better, more expensive gas only model at a discount because of our "problems".  This model is bigger and stronger, with a side burner for cooking up the beans (or what have you), while cooking the meat.  We need to get the electric rotisserie for cooking the whole chicken or turkey.  Yum.  Until then....

      Today is officially day 1 of the Atkins Nutritional Approach for me.  I read in an article to day that in order to avoid comfort eating, one should make healthy intentions everyday.  Intentions get your mental attention and after all, it is all a mind game in the end.  Most times, our intentions are really fixated on eating instead of what we think they are on.  This leads of course to the overwhelming attention given to snacking all the time.  So, today my intentions are to eat controlled carb, healthy meals and snacks, to minimize the snacks I eat (1 mid-morning, 1 afternoon), to exercise this evening, and to enjoy myself.  I am trying to think of rewards for myself as I work off my weight.  I think for my first 10 pounds, I will treat myself to a spa day at Aveda.  10 pounds lighter here I come!  Once I reach my ultimate goal -- shopping spree here I come!  Last weekend was jammed full of stuff to do.  Saturday was spent out and about while Sunday was Father's Day.  Ted is getting a new grill for Father's Day, a Char-Broil Charcoal/Gas Grill.  I'll let everyone know when we plan to "test" the new grill!  Until then....

      Ug!  I had this whole entire post written, then I went to go and look at something and POOF! it be gone.  Sucks.  So, the abridged version for your pleasure.    As you can see, I wanted to add some spice to my life, so I changed everything up, got a new background, new title for my blog.  The whole works.  Atkins is good says the co-workers.  Healthy food of the day is V-8 Hot & Spicy.  Looking for a diet soft drink made with sucralose (Splenda), let me know of any.  Trey likes puppies and calls every animal on four legs puppy.  He even yells "puppy!" when arriving at his paternal grandparents' home.  His vocabulary has really expanded to many two syllable words and beyond.  His cutest phrase is "I love you"  6 weeks and counting to the official grad date.  1 week until the new job starts.  Woohoo!  Until next time....

      I have the most excrutiating headache.  You know, one of those headaches that just beats like a bass drum somewhere behind you eyes.  A headache that makes you beg for blindness, that way the lights around you would cease to send sabers of laser-intense pain through your eyes into your brain.  Yeah, it is definitely one of those headaches.  I read somewhere, I believe in a book about Polynesian Shamanism, that a good way to cure any kind of ache is to imagine it, give it shape, take control of it and move it away from your body.  On a day like this, when Tylenol and Aleve don't seem to cut it, I am more than willing to attempt just about anything.  Taking into account that I have no relaxation music, or even a comfy spot to lay in, I think I will set out on my holistic approach to this burden.  I can see the pain, a muddle ball of blue lights anxiously moving in a circle; their bodies continuously bumping into one another causing sparks of gold light to shoot off around them.  It looks like a racquetball of pure energy, like a chaotic cousin to protons and electrons.  There is no order other than the sphere they seem to be bound by.  I can see my hand underneath the ball, a stark contrast to the blue, glowing orb hovering above it.  I mentally grasp the ball, scoop it up like an ice cream scoop in ice cream.  I dig it away from the innards of my head and push it out into the light.  It is held in front of me now.  I can look upon it with my own two eyes, watching its pulsing pressure, the chaotic paths of each individual light.  With only a slight intake of breath, I prepare to dissolve this pain once and for all.  Whoosh!  The breath leaves my lips in a rush to nudge at the blue orb.  Instantly the little lights, particles really, erupt into a beautiful shower of sparkles.  It looks like a firework display for the Fourth of July.    The pain is gone.

      So, I received some pretty good news yesterday to pep up my new outlook.  I got a new job!!  On June 23rd, I will begin working for DynMcDermott in Metairie.  DynMcDermott is contracted by the US Dept of Energy to manage the nation's petroleum reserves.  I will be writing online exams for the HR department.  There are a number of advantages to this new position, mainly the $8/hr raise and the relative proximity to my home.  I just interviewed two days ago and was pretty certain I wasn't going to get it when I walked out the door, but I guess I was wrong!  So, anyway no excercise last night in lieu of the nature poetry class I am taking;  however tonight will be another trip to the gym.  I'm feeling pretty positive as of now, although I did have a break down last night (damn was class boring!!).  Good thing that the snack and drink man go on vacation from delivering to Loyola during the summer!  I would really like to hear of any ideas people have for defeating the munchies, so let me know

      I am thinking that today is the day to actually tell others about my blog.  Hmm... an interesting concept, aye?  So alas, I have to decided to join the cult and actually faithfully journal my life away on the blog spot.  Welcome!  Anyways, I am actually sitting at work, trying to do anything other than post more information into that access database... pure monotonous work.  The beauty about monotony is it gives you so much time to think about stuff you would never otherwise think about.  One of few things occur when I am bored, I eat (which occurs most often and is bad), I think of story lines for that book I may never write, or I think about current events and their effects on my life.  Sometimes eBay calls my name as well.  Today, blogger yodelled from somewhere in the nether regions of my brain.  So, thinking logically (as I like to do from time to time) I've decided to circumvent the eating tendency while nurturing my need to write and bitch.  YEAH!!  So everyone, you have joined me in just one of my ways I am looking to lose thos 100 pounds I need to lose.  Yes, you read that correctly, I am now embroiled in the battle of the bulge.  I MUST, CAN and WILL lose 80 - 100 pounds to reach my ideal weight for my height.  No time table there, just a goal.  I have begun with little avail (damn the monotony).  I've been exercising at the French Riviera when ever I can.  I've found that going to "da club" at about 8:30p.m. allows me to spend some time with my husband and child before indulging in what I swear my husband thinks is a completely selfish act.  Excluding my class nights (tues and weds), I am looking at making the workout every day I can.  It's time for some serious kick into calorie burning mode.  Eating healthy really isn't a problem for me, as long as I can keep circumventing that boredom snack tendency and cooking my own food, but I've been thinking of going radical... attempting the Atkins lifestyle plan.  The concept makes sense to me, and I am definitely a sugar-a-holic, so I think this will be a smart step for me.    So why the sudden urge?  Well, it is something I have been working up to for awhile, but found little time to devote to.  I've finally made the conscious decision that, like class and family, I HAVE to make time for this side of my life as well.  Ted and I signed up for health insurance last week and my weight will factor into a higher premium for my health.  Not to mention, my addiction to sugar has me on the fast track to type 2 diabetes... not good.  All of these things are factors, but the main factor came Friday.  I viewed the pictures from Paul and Michelle's wedding last Friday and was ashamed.  I looked awful!  Pictures are such truth revealers and boy did these.  I can't even bare the thought of getting family portraits done with my child because of my weight.  At my graduation, I begged my mom to only take pictures of me from the shoulders up!  So, I am ashamed.  I feel that people look at you different when you are my size, like you don't know how to take care of yourself.  I feel that I am more often looked over in interviews because I don't look quite put together as my skinnier counterparts.  Its an awful feeling that I just cannot live with anymore.  So 100 pounds lighter here I come!!

      First, I'm glad to see that my old set-up on Blogger has returned.  I didn't like the simplified version I 've been getting at all.  Next, I was visiting  urlLink Beth's Blog  and saw this entry, so I felt I should try it.  I remember the days of summer league softball in Livingston Parish.  Yeah, I remember the exact year when there was "Big" Amanda McCann, "Little" Amanda, and Amanda (That't me!).  Each of us hated the name Mandy, so new and inventive ways had to be created for us to follow coaching on the softball field, i.e. the references to size.  Lucky for me, I had the memorable and often picked on last name: Fortenberry (Not now, nor have I ever, farted on berries.)  It wouldn't be until LSU Circle K that I would be known as Simpsons prank call Amanda "Hug n' kiss"  So naturally, I was curious about this whole frequency of my name thing.  Even luckier for me, I have two last names to play with (one of the joys of getting married... ha ha)  Here are the results:   Amanda is the #40 most common female name. 0.404% of females in the US are named Amanda. Around 515100 US females are named Amanda! source  urlLink namestatistics.com

      I was listening to the Indigo Girls earlier, two songs particularly: Closer to Fine and Galilleo.  I found my quote of the week from the first: "I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind/Got my paper and I was free."  A reflection of my educational journey, nes pas?  Received the grade report online yesterday, I aced my final class with an A without really even trying, so I am proud.  So, the song Galilleo speaks of past lives and learning.  Really questioning how long it takes us to "get things right" in life.  Somehow this led to me taking a  urlLink past lives quiz  online.  Here are my results:  Diagnosis: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I do not know how you feel about it, but you were female in your last earthly incarnation. You were born somewhere around territory of modern West Australia approximately on 1150. Your profession was teacher, mathematician, geologist. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your brief psychological profile in that past life: Inquisitive, inventive, liked to get to the very bottom of things and to rummage in books. Talent for drama, natural born actor. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lesson, that your last past life brought to present: There is the invisible connection between material and spiritual world. Your lesson -- to search, to find and to use this bridge. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now you remember? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I pressed submit several times to see if I got the same results, just so I could see if they were "containerized."  I of course looked up my family... my dad was a girl... hee hee.  I also found an A+ song lyric site  urlLink http://www.lyricsfreak.com/  which list pretty much every artist and tons of songs.  Not all the lyrics are 100% accurate, but far more accurate than other sites I have used.  Being the curious sort, I looked up Enigma because most of their songs are in Latin or French just because they can.  I was pleased to find not only the lyrics in their original dialect, but also some translations (saves me a trip to the online French/English or Latin/English dictionaries!).  I learned that Sadness Part I, which came out when I was 12 or 13, is about Marquis de Sade and that most of that album is very questioning of religious beliefs in conflict with human desires... particularly the song Mea Culpa.  Very intriguing and I am a complete dork for looking at it.    Alas, this is how the free time graduation has alotted me has thus been spent.  I am contemplating a read of Dante's Divine Comedy, or at least The Inferno, which seems a reputable and well educated thing to do.  First, I must finish my backlog of smut, the first four of the Harry Potter series, and the NINE (Yes, I said nine) Janet Evanovich novels I just ordered a few weeks ago.  The smut may be put to pasture for awhile, I've grown bored with it lately.    Other than that, not much going.  In a month, I will be finished with my current job assignment.  We shall see where the career road will takes me from here.

      Well, Ted's surprise went down yesterday with relative success.  Thanks to everyone who helped Ted celebrate his 25th birthday!  For those who missed out, here's what happened.  After attempting to keep Ted pretty much clueless in the face of him accusing me of lying, etc, etc, Ted's mother called our home at 1 p.m., a short hour before she was to arrive at our house for barbecuing.  I have to say she performed with perfection as her voice was filled with panic and frustration because her car "would not start."  She requested that Ted come and pick them up, so this got him out of the house.  About five minutes after Ted left, I quickly went to work, picking up the cake from Gambino's, then came back to greet the guests.  Everyone arrived at our home for the surprise by two o'clock.  Ted arrived by 2:30 (his mom went 50mph on the interstate to delay him).  He came in yelling that he knew something was up, but I think he was very pleased to see all of his friends around to celebrate with him.  Cooking commenced soon thereafter and everyone definitely had their fill of all kinds of food.  Later that evening, we went to see Johnny English with Becca and Tommy.  My conclusions on this film:  I adore British humor and Rowan Atkinson (AKA Mr. Bean), BUT this was not his best film.  I found myself close to sleep several times (funny scenes did creep up at exactly the right moments to keep me awake).  I don't regret seeing the film, but I was definitely a renter.  Before the film, Becca presented me with a present for Trey.  This being a sweet looking, very animated potty training bear which sings the memorable tune "I'm a super duper pooper."  Yes, it is as scary as it sounds, but very entertaining.  At first, I thought he was singing I a super, duper poo-poo.. which was even more entertaining. :-)  For the highlight of the evening, Becca and Tommy joined us for an evening on Bourbon.  We stopped into Coyote Ugly at around midnight, little action going on there.  We then headed off to Pat O's.  Pat O's was VERY busy -- filled with drunked LSU students (much to the chargrin of Ted...)  Magnum Matt met up with us around one and we enjoyed an evening of drinking in the Piano Bar (Yes, we heard Hey Fighting Tiger at least  once an hour.  Ole Miss chimed in right as we were leaving.. GRRR...)  My new favorite drink is the Bloody Mary, I LOVE hot and spicy V8!  After scarfing a ridiculously overpriced piece of pizza from Dante's (It was the best I've had though), we headed home for about four.  Altogether, a real fun evening... haven't celebrated like that in a LONG time.  Let it be known... I did know "what my name are"...  Becca, I love you too... :-)  Today has been spent walking around in a haze of hangover exhaustion.  Ted and I somehow managed to scare up enough energy to clean this morning before lounging around for the rest of the day.  Our one venture outdoors today was to retrieve our son from wence we sent him the night before.  Even that was shortlived... I fell asleep on the couch maybe 2 minuted after walking in the door.  I literally have been fighting to keep my head held up!  At about 6:30, Ted decided that he wanted to watch the pay-per-view, so he is all into that right now.  I am writing this in an effort to not go to sleep at such an insanely early hour.  Once again, thanks to everyone for helping us have a great day!  I hope we can all do it again soon!

      So, yesterday was Ted's birthday.  To "celebrate" we went and ate at Cici's Pizza, then visited our favorite electronics superstore -- BestBuy.  Ted decided to purchase a new game for his XBox, Outlaw Golf.  This is a original reincarnation of golf for the video game system.  The premise behind it is rather indecent... the players are wanna-be rappers (name Ice Trey no doubt), strippers, latin-lovers, and heavy-metal chicks... oh yeah, there is a dominatrix among other players to unlock.  So, you already have the salt of the earth, next add in harder-than-usual controls and a "composure meter" that measures when you f-up or do something good and adjusts the hardness (and your temper) accordingly.  So, what do you get?  A chance to kick the shit out of your caddy, what else!  This game is so cool... it even curses!  It's like Happy Gilmore meets golfing video game.  You get beating tokens with which you can work off some steam by beating the crap out of your poor unfortunate caddy.  This game is way cool and pretty cheap.  It was only $19.95, compared to the usual $49.95 of most games.  There is also an Outlaw volleyball game that I would like to checkout in the near future.  BTW, guess who won the inaugural game... moi!

      Okay, so I was annoyed that what I wanted to do was only working on my work computer ?!?!?  So... another remodel here.  It is pretty much close to what I want.  If not, I am not changing it until I learn enough to make my own template.  I guess that will be my first post-university project... learning html.  Today is Ted's 25th b-day, but we won't be doing much... maybe order some pizza and eat some cake, if I stop and get one!  Don't have time to make my own from scratch, perhaps next year.  Other than that, not much is going on.  Work is going... obviously still bored since I am writing during the day.  I think I may make another writing installment today at  urlLink http://aimelee.blogspot.com .  My mother says she enjoyed the first installment, so maybe there is hope for me!

      Well, I can now officially look forward to the calls from Institutional Advancement for the rest of my life now.  That's right, I have finally completed my learning journey at Loyola University!  At 6 yesterday evening, I sat in the last school desk I will ever have to sit in for my undergraduate career and passed up the last ever undergrad paper.  Somewhere around 6:45 p.m., I passed in my last ever exam, complete with the last ever blue book.  I am now officially FINISHED!  A college graduate -- YEAH!  It was really weird, almost anticlimatic in a way, knowing that you will never have to visit the campus again.  It felt weird walking out of the building last night, knowing I didn't have to come back!  What am I going to do with all this free time I will have?  No more studying, no more getting home at 10 p.m., no more all-night paper writing sessions.  It feels very weird because it is what I have been doing for so long.  If not, there has always been the anticipation of going to class the next semester.  Now, it's like... An incomplete sentence with an ellipsis.  No more learning :-(  Am I a dork or what?  I am not ready to start any new classes.  I really need the break, but give me a year and I can see myself returning for graduate work.  I don't think I will be able to keep myself from learning more about everything, I just enjoy it too much.  I'm going to be one of those weird life-long students, I swear.  For now, I need to focus on getting a career and helping Ted get out of school -- his grad date is looking like Dec 04.  It's also probably time for Ted and I to start setting down real roots -- buying a house and all that goes with it.  Grown-up things... ugh.  Last night after I finished, Ted and I went out to celebrate.  We went over to Serrano's in the Clearview Mall -- They have the best latin food and marghertias -- mmmmm!  I had a couple of different drinks and chicken enchiladas (they are the best!!); Ted had an Abita and steak tacos.  Afterwards, I was a little tired (and a little tipsy) so we went home... I only had two hours of sleep the night before because of studying and general procrastination on my paper.  It was a fun; I look forward to celebrating with my friends soon... perhaps this weekend ;-)   Rant of the day:  Only in New Orleans can you have a potential accident with a freakin' forklift!  Driving to Loyola from work, I usually take Earhart and cut through "Hollygrove."  Well, I'm about to turn on to the street to cut through to Jefferson and this forklift pulls out in front of me!  Those familiar with the area, you know where that cabinet place is on Earhart?  Well the guy was driving on his side, I on mine, then all of the sudden he just cuts me off.  I, of course, have to slam on the brakes, risking the whole rear end collision in the midst of 5 p.m. traffic.  And he has the nerve to give me a look like I was in the wrong!  Freakin' idiot!  Little did he know, for a few seconds I thought about hitting his stupid ass.  But guilt, defensive driving, and the logical fact that the company probably would repair my car kept me from doing it.  Not to mention, I don't remember hearing the forklifts were street legal in my forklift class a few years back.  Idiot!

      Please pray for Marie Hill, grandmother of a very dear friend of mine.  She may have suffered from a stroke and will be undergoing an MRI today.  She is a strong and caring woman who has touched my friend's life and my life profoundly.  She is not afraid of death, but of a living death where she is no longer able to function as she does today.  Pray that she will find peace and reach the pinnacle of the aging and death process, acceptance.  Also, pray for that same peaceful arrival to acceptance for my friend as she faces true grief and loss for the first time in her life.

      I've concluded that those ads at the top of the blog are directly related to things stated in the blog itself.  This explains why Lauren has malpractice stuff on her site, and why Candance has bra ads on hers.  I have Imitrex ads... not sure where that correlation comes from, but I am willing mess with it, just to see what I get.  The ads are powered by Google, so obviously google searches the blog for keywords, then derives ads from those words.  Soo, what can I get Google to find??  Weight loss, breast enhancement, penis enlargement... those would be interesting.  Perhaps porn??  I wonder what a treatise on the anal sex laws would bring?  I wonder what sets it off?  Maybe its a name, like Victoria's Secret or NIKE. I don't know.  I'm really trying to avoid what I need to do right now.  If I read anymore on the Cold War and how exaggerated it was, I think I will scream.  Vietnam was not about the containment of the USSR and Communist China.  It wasn't about their WMDs.  No, it was about control, order, and the assertion of the US as the hegemon.  The Truman Doctrine all but laid that out in the beginning of the Cold War.  The U.S. was ALWAYS more powerful than the Soviet Union just on the basis that Marx's socialist philosophies were contradictory and could never work!  The USSR really had little nationalism in which to bolster the support of their people; therefore if faced with direct conflict, the USSR would have most definitely failed even sooner than it did.  Bipolar power was an exaggeration.   The same can be said for the conflict in Iraq.  We aren't looking for WMD!  WMDs do not matter in the long run.  We need a foot hold in the Middle East in order to make an attempt to contain terrorism and radical Islam fundamentalism.  Unlike the USSR and China, the religious element of the radical Islam fundamentalists HAS the power to take on the U.S. hegemonic position.  There are tons of people who are willing to die for their religion in the Middle East because religion has a power that money and government can never establish, hence the reason why the seperation of church and state is so important.  That is why the fight is right.  The US government is wrong however, in assuming that the citizens of the US are not smart enough to understand this reasoning.  Instead, they have hidden behind ill-conceived lies in order to justify their means to the uneducated masses.  It is for this that I am offended.  While this cannot be truly said for the area New Orleans alone per say, I believe that the nation in general is not as dumb as our government would like to think.  And I speak of the government as a whole, both right and left wings.  That the people have caught on so quickly is promising.  I envision reform for the future.  I'm not speaking of tax cuts or new policy, but  reform in the trust government has in the people who support it.  Believe me, I work in a government building... the government does not trust us the average joe anymore than we trust them!  When I speak of trust, I mean an active effort to involve the citizens in the real basis for government decisions, instead of lording over the masses as they truly do right now.  I believe this trust will naturally give way to smaller government, less spending, etc, etc.    If you look just on a local level, at Mayor "Sugar" Ray Nagin, you can see a shift in this direction.  Nagin doesn't seem to approach city government like his predecessor.  He has taken a grassroots approach, talking with people within the community, developing plans of action based upon what is needed for the community rather than the "lords" of the city council.  He has accepted that MOST of the community has the ability to achieve intelligent thought, that people really can decide what is best.    Geez, I'm getting a little to heavy for myself now!  I try to avoid discussions on politics, mainly because I usually get myself into trouble.  But now that I've gotten that off my chest, I feel I can continue with the reading...  I think I've also decided the definite direction of my paper, for now...

      I started a new blog exclusively for my writing today under my pen name Aime Lee.  "Why a pen name, you freak?" some of you may be asking.  Quite simply, it helps.  I've suffered from major creative writer's block for several years now.  I sometimes feel like I am cheating on my real life by fantasizing about what I write about.  Other times, I've been bogged down with so much class writing, that I don't even want to attempt to write for fun.  The pen name is helping create a different identity (in a completely non-schizophrenic manner).  It is helping me to relieve some of my guilty feelings as well as allowing me to air out through fictional prose some of the things that I've experienced in the past.  I hope this getting proverbial pen to paper method will help me to work through my block!  So, why that particular name?  Aime is my grandmother maiden name.  Also, Aime and Amanda mean the same thing in their respective languages (worthy of being loved), so it seemed like a nice choice.  Lee is my middle name.  Aime Lee is short, simple, and kind of catchy.  I like it.  So everyone, please check out my "writing" journal,  urlLink Aime Lee's The Untitled  .  My idea is to try and write serial style.. kind of like a on-going book, but I may just write random scenes that come to me.  I would really appreciate your comments, as I strive to improve myself as a writer.  Remember, I want to get published one of these days, so tell me what you want to read!!

      Just took the Louisiana quiz:  I scored a  92%  on the "How Louisiana are you?" Quizie!  urlLink What about you?    Major life event here:  Cane's on the Westbank is now open!!!  Ate there Saturday night... mmmmm!  Can't wait until they open the one in Metairie/Kenner.  For now, I have to agree it is the Bestbank, what with IHOP and Cane's next to each other.  Did you know that BR has a minor league baseball team, the B.R. Riverbats?  Yes, their mascot is a bat.  They play in the diamond by Memorial Stadium.  (Memorial Stadium stinks on the visitor's side.  Is that a nasty trick played by Catholic High??)  Now I remember way back in the days of LSU Circle K, attending a Cap. City Kiwanis meeting and watching a presentation about the Baton Rouge Downtown Development Plan.  This plan was to include a new parking garage, shopping, a new upscale hotel and face-lift to the Centroplex, among other things.  They also mentioned something about a minor league team and building a field in the middle of downtown.  The current field is the public field high schools use, isn't it?  Does anyone know if this is still the plan?  Ted was picking on me and my LSU fan legion yesterday, saying that BR has a minor league team that can only bring in 200 people a game because EVERYONE is an LSU fan in Baton Rouge.  But if I remember correctly, this field is in the ghetto of downtown North Baton Rouge, near the governor's mansion and the Long Hospital.  I think Catholic High plays, or did play, there... am I right, Lauren?  I would think that would be a better exlanation than everyone only wanting to see LSU play (even if it is an off-season).  Which brings me to my LSU fanaticism.  Sprint Vision is missing something... namely the LSU Fight Song, LSU Pregame, LSU Alma Mater, or even Hey, Fighting Tigers (Hey, Look Me Over for the LSU non-believers).  (Side note:  No, Hey, Fighting Tigers is NOT the fight song... the honors go to Fight for LSU.  My grandfather was Assistant Director of Bands at LSU during the Col. Corazo era, the man behind the pregame, fight song and beautiful alma mater.)  I've got the screensaver, which looks pretty cool on my color screen.  I NEED an LSU ringtone, but can't find one I can download.  Does anyone have any good polyphonic LSU midi files I can send to Sprint (or upload directly to my phone... there is a way)?  Please, send them my way.  I am especially looking for the alma mater... a beautiful piece even without the extra meaning...  I'm too lazy to dig out the sheet music and download a midi program, but I'd like it for footbal season.  P.S. -- for those who were at the parades Sunday before Mardi Gras, this year's hottest marching band tune,  the SportCenter theme, is available. :-)  Two days until the final class of my undergraduate career.  I plan on buying a bottle of something and celebrating Tuesday night.  If anyone would like to join me, give me a call or drop me a line.  Ted's birthday is Thursday, not doing anything for that.  His parents are suppose to be coming over Saturday around 2 p.m. for some barbecue...

      We are safe.  Apparently 106.7 has suffered from a freak accident.  Remember that storm two days ago?  From the 106.7 website last night:   Please Be Advised:   The wire is on fire!  The tower is toast!  Is this the end of THE END?!  Certainly not.  As you may have noticed, we are not on the air right now.  Our tower was struck by lightning last night--We did not go anywhere!!  Keep listening and checking back for updates.  Alas, we are all safe from 97.1!  Now, if only we could get Rod Ryan axed and Lex and Terry back!!  Even better, HIRE O&A!!  YEAH!  Now, on to KLSU.  I have a question... Why isn't there a college radio station in New Orleans???  With THREE major universities... 6 in all... shouldn't there be at least one indie channel??  Also, with two major communications schools (UNO and LOYOLA) shouldn't there be an indie channel???  Loyola had a TV station at one time, why no radio station???  Now, I know UNO has a classical channel, which is an excellent channel when in the mood for classical BUT....  Tulane had a channel at one time that played obscure music, but I haven't been able to find it.  I don't know... I guess I miss my "pound of coffee" and the knowledge that the song I was listening to right now probably wouldn't get played for another few months.  I think I will go listen to the Lemonheads now.  Enough of a flashback, I must get to work.  I need to clean up a bit before heading off to the library to study and research.

      CORRECTION:  Michelle and Paul live in Northeast BR not Southwest.  Being from Southeast BR and a graduate of "Weed"lawn HS (in Southeast BR as well), I obviously have not learned my directions.  Either that, or I've been living in the NO area too long to remember my directions... someone explain to me exactly how the Westbank is west again, please!  Perhaps all those years of marching band are to blame because I can't recall left or right half the time either... I have many band friends who suffer the same indignity... something to do with right flanks and left slides being yelled at you that just makes you forget...  Anyway, finals are next week.  I officially have 4 more days before I am officially a college graduate for pertuity!  This weekend, I will of course be doing my best (and last) session of undergraduate procrastination (I have a LARGE paper to write and a few chapters to read).  If I study at all, I will be doing far better than what I did for the mid-term... BTW I scored a 95% on that exam so obviously this class is pretty easy.    Ted and I officially began the great adventure of potty training Trey last night with the purchase of a training toilet and training pants.  Yes, we got roped into buying the one that makes the "real" flushing sounds.  Now Trey has already figured out what it's for... to "PEE-PEE".  He sat on it last night without fright, which according to the fine experts at Babycenter.com puts us ahead of the game.  Now we just need to figure out how to get him to 1) realize he has to go AND 2) get him to actually go.  My son is pretty bright and loves to be like the BIG people, so hopefully this won't be too much of a hassle.  Meanwhile, I have a feeling that this adventure, much like most of what Trey does, will become some interesting fodder for this blog.  On to cleaner things, does anyone know what happened to 106.7 THE END this morning?  I got into my car, prepared to listen to Rod Ryan, and got some cheese from Jackson, MS of all places.  Now first, let me lament upon the demise of THE TIGER for a second.  For those fellow BR people who read this from occasion, you probably remember this.  In the summer of '96 (I'd just graduated from HS), our one and ONLY "modern" rock channel went off the air.  The powers that be had decided that three country channels just weren't enough for the rednecks of the BR area.  NO, let's just add another to the line-up.  Thus, 100.7 CAT COUNTRY was born.  Now this really upset many of the younger generations of BR, me especially.  Those who knew, turned the dial to KLSU (which mainstreamed... another rant for another day).  Others were forced to listen to Top 40 or buy CD players for their vehicles.  Alas, an era died that day... we all sang "bye bye, Miss American Pie"... okay not really, but the last song  THE TIGER played was "It's the End of the World" by REM.  But it really did suck!  Since then, they've gotten a new modern rock station, 104.9, and lost some country (THANK GOD!).    Now New Orleans has already lost the brief 94.9, which had cutting edge talk radio (Lex and Terry and Opie and Anthony were AWESOME) and cutting edge music.  Tune in now and you get the wonderful strains of gospel.  Now if 106.7 has flown south, I am once again the perverbally screwed listener.  Grrr!  Let us all hope that its just some funky interference or something.  If you visit the website, the web cam is still up and working... HMMM....  Station is still out though... WEIRD

      Today was MOVING DAY for Paul and Michelle.  Ted and I helped, getting in some quality time with my mom while here.  Their home is cute and cozy, located on the southwest side of Baton Rouge in what Ted and Michelle term as "the middle of nowhere."  All this moving excitement makes me long for a home of my own.  It also makes me homesick for Baton Rouge.  I don't know, Baton Rouge is just so different from New Orleans, yet I can't put my finger on it.  I think it is the perfect mixture of town and city -- country and modern life.  Things are at once simple and complex in Baton Rouge.  I enjoy the fact that one feels "in the middle of nowhere" even though they are in the middle of the city.  I  guess its a perfect mixture of nature and modernization that appeals to me.  It surely is something I never identified before now.  There are little quirks about Baton Rouge that just make me stop and think.  For example, I used my hi-beams to drive home this evening.  Hi-beams, WOW!  It is nice to know they work, because I think I've used them maybe once since I bought my CR-V in 2000.  Yet in Baton Rouge, there are streets, pretty major ones, with minimal street lights.  The pine trees stretch out along the twisting roadway (The city planners of BR MUST have been drunk because there are no straight streets in Baton Rouge), yet a blink away is a bar, a grocery store and a McDonald's.  It isn't the type of relationship with nature that New Orleans has.  In New Orleans, nature is muted... one has to look closely for it.  The relationship is more of a battle, like the preparations for a tropical storm/hurricane or the chaos a hard rain brings.  Nature is more of a nusance than something to work with.  For me, everything feels out of wack here in New Orleans.  So, the plan has taken seed in my brain.  Ted and I want to purchase a house next year.  I feel ill when I think of buying a home in New Orleans...  again,  not the same.  I think Ted and I have come to a semi-agreement.  As of now, we may settle in LaPlace; however I am still pushing for closer to BR.  Several key issues involved here.  1 -- To use Paul's phrase, "Every neighborhood in Baton Rouge has a park in it."  The park, as symbol,  is a community that cares about itself.  2  -- You get more house for your money in BR versus New Orleans.  I absolutely do not want a house with a closed in garage or add-on room.  No way-uh-uh....  3 -- Don't have to pay from private school unless we really want to.  Quite honestly, I know more EBR public school kids who went to better universities than the valedictorians for the last two classes at DeLaSalle.  That ain't right!  4 -- Peace of mind.  Okay, with the exception of the recent serial killer, violence in BR is pretty segregated.  There are those neighborhoods you just don't go in EVER.  The major drawback, of course, is the drive to Metairie daily.  In all honesty, it's just as bad as a drive from the Northshore.  I'd rather BR.  Will this remotely even happen in a year?  I've got my doubts.  While, I REALLY want to move to the BR area, I just don;t know if it will be feasible.  Only time can tell, I guess.  Until then...

      So two years ago on July 7, 2000, Ted and I were married.  That night, we dined at Sullivan's in Baton Rouge then spent the evening at the Courtyard Marriott.  The meal was excellent, the hotel was comfortable, and the jacuzzi was nice.  All together, we had a great time.  For our first anniversary, Ted and I decided to play tourists in New Orleans.  We stayed the night on Bourbon St at the Royal Sonesta.  Dined at the hotel's four star restaurant, walked on Bourbon, and I finally got to have my first Hurricane at PAT O's... Yes, I AM A DORK!  Anyways, we had a blast and it felt like a mini-honeymoon.  So, what are we doing now?  Well, for starters I've been majorally ill since the 4th.  Not fun, but Ted and I had decided to celebrate on Saturday a week ago, so Saturday afternoon Trey was picked up by my mother-in-law... I was still sick on the couch.  Somehow, I managed to drag my sickly carcass off the couch to dress nice enough to get into the nearest Houston's where dosed up with Pepto and Imodium Advance, I managed to make it through a meal, a game of putt-putt at Celebration Station, and a visit to Best Buy.  Yes, you've heard right, I went to Celebration Station and Best Buy on my "wedding anniversary" because I felt too sick to do anything else.  I passed out a mere half hour after returning home for 9p.m. that evening.  So, today is the exact day.  What are we doing?  Well, I am STILL ill.  Trey is REALLY ill.  Ted is well... go figure.  So, I've spent my day dealing with the ill.  I will spend my night dealing with the ill.  And then, its off to work tomorrow... hopefully.  What a wonderful anniversary!

      Before I get to what I really want to type about here this:  I was just checking my e-mail on Hotmail and noticed a link on the home page.  The link was to an article about JFK, Jr... conjecturing if he had a troubled marriage.  Pardon me, but hasn't he AND his wife been dead for upteen years now?  Isn't it a little ill suited to speak of the dead in this fashion.  Now mind you, I have not read the article, don't plan to really.  I was just struck by 1) how rude this seems and 2) how un-newsworthy the factoid may be.  Let the dead lie in peace!  Anyway, on to my real reason for being here.  Now, I am convinced that I think about religion far more than the average bear.  This thought pattern is not the typical pattern of say a person claiming to be a born again Christian, "Saved", or the like.  No, I continually like to challenge my beliefs with facts and impressions that I learn in daily life.  I guess one could say that I keep my faith "up-to-date."  Now, because my parents were both Catholics when I was born, because they sometimes brought me to church really early inthe morning, and because I even was forced to attend the very uneducational cathecism classes at Immaculate Conception in Denham Springs; I consider myself a Roman Catholic when defining religion is needed.  I've never been confirmed and I often waiver between whether I want to be or not.  For the most part, I believe in most of the Catholic dogma; and I find no sin in disagreeing from time to time (which probably makes me a heretic).  One of the big teachings I disagree with is in the creation story itself -- that man was created to control both nature and other creatures.  Also that man alone was created in God's image.  Most of you know that a little storm named Bill made an unexpected visit on Monday.  I find in his visit a lesson in faith and religion that I thought I would share for a change.  First let me explain my belief.  I believe that when God, or the higher power, created the world, he created the ENTIRE world in his image.  Thus, when we put nature, animals, humans and everything else together -- we get GOD, something all-powerful and all-knowing must come from EVERYTHING.  Ok, stating that, I think Bill taught us an important lesson about our place in this world.  With all of our technology, we still cannot control the weather, much less accurately predict a storm.  For all the complexities we have brought into our realm, we cannot escape how nature shapes our life.  I think this is an important thing to remember.  Onto other news... I've got the haircut today.  Pictures will be forthcoming, but until then....

      Alabama is being Alabama, as everyone has heard by now.  I was reading comments on  urlLink Beth's Blog  this morning when I started thinking in a tangent too long for Haloscan.  My husband told me this morning that "it isn't about the religion behind the ten commandments, it is its symbol as the moral basis for law, as any educated person would know."  Law makers are charged with the great task of somehow synthesizing natural and moral thought into law.  Many philosophers have debated this throughout the centuries, even before the U.S. was discovered.  The problem lies in moral relativism.  How can we choose one over another?  Is there some greater moral code that supercedes all moral philosophies?  Is Christianity better because we have this cool story about a guy getting hung from a wooden cross, dying, then coming back to life?  What about that cool cat Buddha,  huh?  Or the Hindu thing with the octopus arms?  Squabbling over this stone structure is like the ongoing abortion debate, which is so bogged down in moral relativism and feminism.  Let's cut through the crap here: how many of the commandments are common practices everywhere?  Don't indiginous tribes honor their elders?  Have you seen a Hindu kill ANYTHING lately without being punished?  As awful as the extremists are, have you seen any Muslim use  their  Lord's name in vain??  Are morals really equal to just one religion?  Maybe the issue isn't about the laws itself, but about the use of "God."  Okay people, putting beside however many years of whatever religious doctrine has been fed to you there are a few basic principles to ALL religions that we ALL share.  I don't care if you are monotheistic or polytheistic... Pagan, Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, Mythologist or Islamist... everyone has "god" figures in their religion.  They may not call them God, there may be more than one even, but they are there.  In polytheism, there is always a grand poo-bah "god" that is the supreme being, like the Sun God or some such.  Think about the Catholic religion with all of its saints, etc.  How is this so very different from having several smaller dieties??  Oh, I forgot we have to complicate matters by calling them "saints," because the other label is reserved for only one.  A god is a god is a god... just looks different from person to person.  Looking from the very beginnings of culture, language was pretty limited and "god" is little more than a grunt.  Yeah, I am so guilty of moral relativism here, but I sleep well at night.  When did American culture sink to not teaching us how to think?  I get ripped on by Ted all the time: for my liberal education at Loyola, for my capacity to think for both sides, for my tendency to think EVERYTHING through, but isn't that what we should all do?  Yeah, it really pisses me off when God is referred to as the "father."  I just don't see how God can be any sex whatsoever, much less a race.  Do I go off going "rabble, rabble" to make everyone believe me, to force people to stop calling God by masuline names?  NO.  Do I force people to believe what I believe because it encompasses more people?  NO.  I can understand how some people need to believe God is the"father."  I can easily ignore the imagery in deference to my own beliefs when scripture is read aloud.  Acceptance, isn't that what America is about?  Does this mean people shouldn't protest anything? NO.  It means we need people to think before they go off rabble-rousing.  We all need to learn when to fight the good fight and when to genuflect to the higher order of wisdom.    Yes, putting the Ten Commandment structure in that building was done without little thought to others, which was wrong.  Yes, people did not stop to think about the higher "non-religious" message the structure represents, which was also very wrong.  Yes, the protests and opinions of all the people matter, but let us not forget that Alabama was once the state who protested in mass against desegregation.  No, the warbling of the angry mass is not always right or "constitutional."  Sometimes, it is just downright uneducated and ill-conceived.

       Oh Walgreens, how do I love thee, let me count thine ways... One bottle of insulin purchased for the diabetic cat, Two months expired, can you imagine that? Three interactive menus it took to talk to a person, Four hour wait to get a new prescription...   Today, as I was about to administer a dose of insulin to my cat Bloomer, I chanced to look at when the bottle would expire. 06/01/2003, well that's grand.  My first thought was: no wonder the cat isn't getting any better.  My second, third, and fourth... what if they do this to other people's pets, persons, or relatives??  My last.. mother-f'ing Walgreens...yada, yada.  Fun doesn't stop there, as it never wants to for me.  SO, I call Walgreens (I'm thinking this is a 24 hour one)... not open.  Okay, so I call from work later... go through all the recorded bullshit, speak to someone who passes me to someone else, so on and so forth.  FINALLY, we get to speak to Ms. Walker.  Ms. Walker, the intelligent and capable pharmacist that she is realizes the culpability of her staff's act as soon as I say the words 2 months expired and insulin.  I nice big catch of breath followed by a very mournful "Oh my God."  Lucky for her, He was listening and this wasn't very extreme or anything.  I applaud her for bending over backwards to get this issue resolved expediantly, calling my neighborhood Walgreens to fill them in so I can get the meds changed out without driving all the way out to NoEast.  Not her fault that the line is incessantly busy.  Still I shutter to think what grave mishap this could have been.  Luckily, all I was suffering from was an incontinent cat, not a life threatening ordeal.  Speaking of hypos, I watched the Mike Myers Actor Studio thing on Bravo the other day... they spoke of the Hyper Hypo skit...the one with Nikki Kidman.  I swear, that has to be one of my favorite skits of all time, second only to Buckwheat's Greatest Hits.  What does this have to do with anything?  Absolutely nothing...  I've decided to take a day of respite from the election BS in salute to my new employment info and the Labor Day holiday.  This weekend is shaping up to be pretty busy, so look for my sketches to return after the holiday.  This weekend will be spent in Baton Rouge, where I will be so close, but so far away from the opening game of the LSU Football season.  I'm sure if I bothered, I could get tickets, but I'd rather save my energy for the Florida game.  No, this weekend will be spent at the home of the Baton Rouge Newfields (hee hee).  Michelle is hosting a scrapbooking party (AKA: Hen Party or Chick-thing for the male readers) at her home on Sunday.  Monday is barbecue at the house that has no barbecue pit (this is per my sister-in-law).  I either see a very large purchase in their future or something in the back of my CR-V on the way to and from BR.  Who knows, but I am sure it will be delicious.  Until then, I am off to pester the employees of the Airline/Clearview Walgreens.

        I HAVE A JOB!!!!    I found out today that my department has decided to extend my contract through the end of the year!  This means I get to stay and no more job hunting!!  GO ME!!  This is a very good thing, because chances are I may be able to become permenant by this time.  Reason being: one of the other PD employees is moving to Florida as soon as his house sells here.  I am SO very excited about this because if you haven't checked the job market out in New Orleans... it is S-H-I-T-T-Y!  Nothing but outside sales... not even secretarial work!  So, congrats to me, as I remain on my job for the remainder of the year.  This great news also leads to more good news: Aloha Tioga!  I am definitely there Thursday night, ready to cook up some food!  Wow!  Such a weight has been lifted... the world turns again... ahhhhhhhh......

      I'm a proud potty-training momma today.  My son, one-shoed and all, peed in his toilet last night after telling me he had to go, "pee-pee."  While this may seem personal, I am ever so proud of my little baby because up until that point, this whole potty-training business was getting real hectic.  For example, my son has thought this was all a game.  He would say the magic word "pee-pee," get his pants pulled down, then run away.  Once  he has a little accident while playing his game... I won't go into it, but let us just say it wasn't pretty and it wasn't "pee-pee."  But anyway, Ted and I were so happy (and shocked because we hadn't been doing much) last night.  We are one bathroom trip away from diapers!  YEAH!!!  I've been purusing the paper since most of my job connections have fizzled.  Congrats to the good ole T-P for the wonderful display of intelligent copy editting today.  Yes this is an actual ad as seen in the 8/27 T-P:    Teachers and Instructors  Touters Needed Call 738-0013     Do you think???   Anyway, although I've been trying to alternate between Republican and Democrat candidates, I just couldn't resist Jay Blossman for another day.  This, like Ieyoub, will be short and sweet:  Website:   urlLink www.jayblossman.com   Political Affiliation:  Republican  My Opinion:  Blossman actually compares himself to Reagan in the introduction to "Roadmap for Change," his comprehensive plan for Louisiana.  This had me rolling my eyes and wondering... did Reagan frequent spas?  This man has come out of the closet with smear campaign after smear campaign, even before qualifying began.  The whole reason why I  HAD  to write this today was because of his latest... against Cleo Fields.    First, some background on Mr. Fields.  My characterization is drawn from an experience I had with said representative, congressman, or whatever he is from Baton Rouge.  Mr. Fields is a tall and thin African-American man who wears these round-rimmed glasses that are almost to big for his face.  I can always recognize him by the glasses.... It was African American Appreciation Month (Yes, they do celebrate this in Baton Rouge), and I was either a sophomore or junior at Woodlawn at the time.  We had this assembly where yours truly, Cleo Fields, was our honored guest and speaker for the morning.  Now, I don't recall specifics about the event, but I do remember Mr. Fields' dialect... I'll call it BR Black (Hey, NOLA has Y'at, so why not).  This particular dialect had a few notable words: orange was pronouced ernge, oil was earl.  My favorite was the word pencil (pronounced peancil)... I think the statement was if you wanted to "sharpen your peancil in the peancil sharpener, thank Black America."  You might also remember Mr. Fields as the man who took money from "Uncle Eddie" on film, but has immunity or something.  Altogether, a very sketchy man, with a big question mark in my mind as to why he was ever elected... oh yeah, I think he represents the dumb side of town.    Fields is big into this Baton Rouge inner city leadership organization (a good thing) in which he helped solicit some funds for a $400,000 bus to take the kids to conferences and such.  Blossman says in his commercial, while showing a pic of Fields with the snazzy bus, "Guess who paid for this bus...you did!"  Beyond the obvious shot at government officials mis-managing money, and maybe a shot at Foster for overlooking this, why the hell would Blossman waste his negative juice on someone not even running against him?!?!  Mr. Fields' response was my favorite however, because he claims to have never heard of the Public Service Commission chairperson.  What is even worse is that the claim is a blatant lie!  Fields actually did something right and only solicited a small amount (like $100K) for the organization... the rest came from other sources of the leadership org., not tax payers or the government!  Wow!    Blossman' campaign slogan is "Don't Get Mad, Get Even... Join Jay."  Matt, you program commercial traffic... does GLAD trashbags still use that slogan?? (Don't Get Mad, Get GLAD!)  Bottom line, the man is your typical, unoriginal, and unimaginative politician who has already gotten into deep doo-doo for taking bribes from energy companies (Yeah, yeah... the infamous spa thing).  You know what the PSC is in charge of:  deregulation of telephones and  (a chord is struck from a choir of angels brought down by a bright white light)  energy companies.  This was an important factor in that whole blackout issue up North, grid system, and yada-yada.   Hmmm...   He will obviously go to any lengths to get what he wants, even lying.  I see him going the same way as a certain police chief who ran for mayor of New Orleans, remember all of his negative ads?  I wouldn't touch this button on the voting machine with a ten foot poll!

      First and foremost, congrats to Matt and Lauren on their engagement!  This couple was there when Ted proposed to me back in 1999, so I was sorry to miss out on the Pat O's celebration.  On other news, yesterday was a sick day for Trey and consequently myself.  He was running a fever, but quickly recovered and by the afternoon he was his usual, bouncy self.  Good news, today I got a phone call from Universal Personnel, one of the headhunter firms I have worked with in the past.  They have a position similar to the one I have now that is available in Belle Chasse.  This one is long-term and would include benefits.  (YEAH!)They are sending my resume over for review, so I hope I get a call about an interview for this one!  Had a fire drill thing during lunch today.  It actually wasn't a drill, the fire alarm system went whacko and the sprinkler system just started going off in the graphics department.  Not good for them, but I did get to learn the evacuation procedure today.  We have to trek halfway across hell and back (just in case of a bomb... nice thought, huh).  I wish I had worn the sandals instead of the professional heels today... my feet are aching!  At least none of our stuff got wet.  We now have undrinkable water... altogether amusing in a noir kind of way.  I'd like to share an observation made during these last few days of political research: every candidate is in first place in the polls.  This amuses me just as much as statements like "Your News Leader" and "The Weather Authority" (sorry Matt) from the media.  Did you know, just because someone states that they are something, this means that they are?  Throw some nifty sounding professional organization and it sounds even better.  Example, The Anderson Group has Bobby Jindal in first place following the latest poll.  Even better, the GOP has Hunt Downer as their winning candidate for the run-off (Visit  urlLink his  website to see how your speculations for a democrat opponent rate with others' opinions).  Wouldn't it be funny to see someone post "XYZ Candidate is dead last in the race for Governor!" on their website.  Just an amusing thought, although I do know why this is done.  Gee, I wish the same thing worked for class research papers, job interviews and raise requests.  Anyway, today's discussion is candidate Hunt Downer:   Website:   urlLink www.huntdowner.com    This website is very slow, even slower than Jindal's.  This is do in part to lack of bandwith and cutesy high-res button links and graphics.  If you have the patience to wait for things to load, check it out, but it can be bypassed as it has little information.   Party Affiliation:  Republican  Hometown:  Houma, LA   (Ooh, ooh... we could get another gov. with a cool accent!)   Education:   BS in Agriculture, Nicholls State University Juris Doctorate, Loyola University New Orleans  (HE HAS GREAT TASTE!)   Experience:  State representative since 1975; Speaker of the House 1996-2000. Brigadier General -- U.S. National Guard  Platform:   Economic Development:  cut taxes and repeal legislation to attract new business and help the small businesses within the state.  Be the "top salesman" for the state, by traveling around to attract new business. Education:  Push accountability and reform.  Supports homeschooling. Public Safety and Homeland Security:  Will use military background to protect the state and its citizens. Infastructure:  Improve roads, ports and airports, which will in turn support job retention and creation.  Spend transportation money responsibly and eliminate bureaucracies. Save Our Coast:  Immediate focus on protecting and restoring state coastlines.  What I Think:   Looking past the fact he has one of those stupid names that can be used as a campaigning gimic (Downer announced that "The Hunt was on!" after he was the first to qualify for the race), I see Downer as a very strong candidate.  He plans to utilize the media to its fullest, so expect to see more commercials in the future from this candidate.  I wish there was more content on the website, but obviously that was foresaken in the name of colorful buttons and displays; I think more of his views will be released through the news and commercial spots.  Downer is leaning towards Ieyoub's means for promoting himself --- stating what he has done; however he goes a step further by offering ideas for the future as well.  He gets points for not going buck wild, like Jindal, and gives very realistic goals for himself if he were elected.  I'm going to get myself in trouble, but I don't like how he pushes homeschooling.  On his site, there is a pretty little button called the Homeschooling Initiative.  He praises parents and children for their efforts, pledges to support them, then invites the students to participate in an essay contest.  This rubs me the wrong way.  Why aren't public school, hell even private school, parents, teachers and students worthy of the same praise.  Why can't they participate in the contest?  Downer should be pledging to improve our education system and supporting a return to the schools we already have in the state!  Sure, homeschoolers get great cognitive education, but these children need social development as well -- something most seriously lack.  Despite this, Downer is probably the strongest candidate the Republicans have.  I expect to see him facing Kathleen Blanco in the run-off.  Also, just as a side note, I found it interesting that Downer was honored by the Baton Rouge Early Risers Kiwanis Club.  I am not sure when this occurred, but I thought it would interest you K-Fam-ites out there.

      Welcome Paul Newfield to the ranks of the blogging society with his new blog:  urlLink Paul's Point of View .  Leave it to a Newfield to think of a name like that... I guess it is like Sucbhauf with the silent b, huh?  Today's political subject will be short and sweet, Richard Ieyoub:   Website:   urlLink www.richardieyoub.com    Because he has lots of money to waste, we see a high-bandwith site with a snazzy flash intro and Star Wars-esque music.  Typically, it is all sparkle and no pertinent content.   Party Affiliation:  Democrat    I'll cut to the chase here.  Ieyoub has no platform, just several pages wasted on everything he has supposedly done during is three unopposed terms as state Attorney General.  He has no plans for the future of the state, despite what he claims, because he is a crook who is just slightly slicker than "Uncle Eddie" Edwards.  He is only viable because he does have name recognition and some stupid jackasses will vote for him based on that.  Be afraid, be very afraid....and don't even think of placing your vote here!

      Since I am researching all the candidates for governor, I thought I would pass on the information I find with all my readers.  This way you don't have to waste the time that I do!     Yes, the post is long, but very infromative.  Please leave your comments so we can all be better informed.  Today's subject is Bobby Jindal:   website:   urlLink www.bobbyjindal.com   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website loaded very slowly, even with a T-1 connection.  .pdf files did not want to load at all.    Party Affiliation:  Republican  Religion:  Roman Catholic   You will see why I mention this later.   Hometown:  Baton Rouge, LA  Education:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduate of Baton Rouge High School  (Not sure if this was before or after it was made a magnet school)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.S. Biology and Public Policy -- Brown University &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masters Degree -- Oxford University (Rhodes Scholar)  He's a smart mo-fo   Experience:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary, LA Dept. of Health and Hospitals  (Appointed by Gov. Foster)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President, University of Louisiana System  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, US Dept of Health and Human Services  Appointed by President Bush   Platform:  I.    Economic Development  Stop taxing corporate investments.  Develop and support community and technical school systems to provide employees for businesses.  Stop taxing state's largest industries (oil and gas)  Raise quality of the flagship research university (LSU) so other regional universities can improve too.    His words, not mine.   Focus tax money where it can do the most good, instead of stretching it thinly across everything. II.   Education  Accountability  Effective Teachers  Competitive Pay  Merit pay for positive performance  Back-to-basics Curriculum (literacy and math)  Target investments  Safe schools and stronger discipline (Alternative Schools for problem children)  More choices for parents  Prepare for success, Pre-K for at risk students  Excellent education for all III.  Faith and Value  Promote adoption as alternative to abortion.  Assistance for women in crisis pregnancies.  Regulate abortion providers.  Ban human cloning.  Protect elderly and infirm.  Education programs to combat divorce.  Promote covenant marriage laws.  Enforce community decency law.  Abstinence education programs  Community based programs  Protect second amendment rights.  Affirm patriotism. IV.  Coastal Restoration V.   Healthcare IV.  Government Reform  unreleased  IIV. Eliminating Waste  unreleased   What I Think:  I was surprised when I thought Jindal had some great ideas.  The online resources (once loaded) were very thorough on most things, outlining his ideas then presenting plans for action for each idea.  Most of his arguments make sense to me.  I agree whole-heartedly with most of his education plans, particularly the push on accountability.  I can see the advantage of pushing merit-based pay.  While it is very materialistic to use money as a way to inspire better teaching, unfortunately this may be the only way to improve what we have.  I wish he would have pushed Pre-K for everyone.  I think this could be an excellent tool for decreasing behavioral problems within school.  Pre-K could primarily focus on the basic rules of citizenship... ideals that are core to behavior and discipline.  If children get it early, it may eradicate the need for it later.  Iim undecided about his idea of allow home-schoolers to participate in extra-curriculars, like sports and band.  Yes, it is good for the interaction, but shouldn't we be focusing on getting more of those home-schoolers back into the education system?  I'm a bit unclear on how he plans to pay for all of these plans he has.  Jindal proposes to do away with the majority of the income that state now sees.  Okay, I can understand it, but what will he do to replace that income lost??  He doesn't answer this question, but then he goes on to propose more spending in other places.  You also have the whole flagship thing... I can just see the UNO students with their lips curling at the statement.  Others have proposed rewarding LSU (and other state universities) for success and producivity, not  numbers... I like that idea better.  Faith and values... oh lord, here we go.  I have to applaud Jindal for not trying to outlaw abortion.  I don't think abortions are right, but I know women who are desperate enough and would do drastic things if it were illegal.  I like his idea of regulating abortion providers while providing assistance and education on alternative measures.  Make sure those who do choose abortion are well cared for, while decreasing the number of abortions by providing help.  I don't agree with the human cloning issue.  I've debated on Biotechnology before and I do believe that some possible cures to diseases we suffer with today can be eradicated through human cloning and DNA replication.  I think we would be better off if this was just highly regulated; only allowing for medical research, for example.  For the most part, I think Jindal gets a little too religious here and I believe it is going to hurt him in the long run.  While I definitely support community based education programs, these need to be more focused on teaching parenting skills instead of preventing divorce.  Yeah, it is a good idea, but I see more pressing issues here.  The covenant marriage laws are awful, particularly in cases where one spouse ends up cheating on the other.  Its a nice idea, but not good in practice.  I roll my eyes at the second amendment rights... just reminds me of what a "good ole' boys" type of state we live in.  Affirm Patriotism??  What does that mean and why??  Again, I have a question of where all the money will come from.  Isn't this guy suppose to be a republican?  Overall, Jindal is very idealistic.  I think he pushes too hard on the religious issues, which will hurt him.  He is very intelligent and speaks to everyone as an equal.  I don't understand how he plans to fund his ideas, so I don't think we will see much that is being promised here.  Ultimately, he is being endorsed by Gov. Foster, who is very popular, so he has a good chance on name recognition and endorsement alone.

      I received some bad news today.  When my contract assignment ends, there will not be another to take its place here at the SPR.  When I accepted this position, I was assured that more than likely I would have a more permenant place after my initial contract... fuckers.  So, I have been voraciously surfing the waves of monster.com, hotjobs.com, and nola.com for some employment opportunities.  Unfortunately, this seems to be few and far between.  Dammit, how come now that I've found something I love and can make money at, I can't find a job!!  It freaking sucks ass!  Luckily (hopefully), Bellsouth offered me a job right around the time I took this position.  They have been holding my resume and told me I could call when I wanted to accept.  The only problem with this is if I take this job, I will be unable to ever take any time off unless it is an extreme emergency.  What does this mean for me?  I may not be able to attend Tioga this year!  While I can conceivably miss Tioga, I feel bad when faced with the oppportunity to not fulfill my obligation to Circle K and Tioga.  My family and well-being do come first and if this is the only thing I can get, then I must take it.  So, I've sent my resume out all over the place; even for jobs in Baton Rouge.  As time progresses, I have a strong feeling I will need to stretch my search out beyond Louisiana, which is not a good thing, but necessary.  Now may be a good time to investigate grad programs.  Funny thing, now that I've finally gotten my bachelors degree, I realize it doesn't mean crap.  No instant job making 40K+.  Woe is me!  If anyone has any connections to some good careers for an intelligent, degreed woman with excellent verbal and written skills, please let me know!  I have until September 16th.

      I didn't realize that 2003 was an election year for Louisiana Governor until a few months ago, when I viewed my first Jay Blossman ad on television.  I am not totally ashamed to admit this, because I don't think the lack of information is entirely my fault.  We all know that our state is attacked everyday for our poor education and lack of jobs.  While we usually fare better than dead last on most issues (thank God for Mississippi), our state can most often be spotted near the bottom of any number of rating lists.  Looking beyond the general discourse of crooked politicians and decades under the leadership of one "Uncle Eddie" Edwards, which has led us down this rutted dirt road of poverty and ignorance, I think this year's election reveals just how low we have all fallen.  When I first realized my oversight, I was appalled.  Here is an election for the highest official in state government and the only candidate I've heard about is Jay Blossman!  I'm an educated individual who reads the news daily -- what must those who are less educated and informed be thinking right now?  Since this time, I have spent several days voraciously searching the Times-Picayune Online for coverage of candidates for governor: who are they, what are their platforms, and what experience can they bring to the office?  I derived this conclusion: I think Forest Gump, or rather the very creative writers of the screenplay, hit upon something: "Stupid is as stupid does."  The media coverage of this year's election thus far has been atrocious!  How can we, as Louisiana citizens, expect to improve our state when we can't even gain information about the important issues in our state -- mainly the governor's election?  How are we expected to make informed decisions for the better of our state if we only know the name of our choices?  We are truly the blind being led by the blind, or the devious...  Okay, I realize that the candidates just began qualifiying yesterday, but they have been campaigning before then.  They've all launched websites and begun soliciting donations to their respective campaigns.  They have all developed platforms with the changes they wish to make, but is this information readily accessible to the general public.... NO!  Instead, our politician's literature is filled with the schools they went to and the affiliations they have.  What is this, a race for SGA president or a governor's election?  Today I decided to search all the state newspaper websites until I found some nugget of info on our candidates' platforms.  I began with the Baton Rouge Advocate, assuming that because they were in the capital and closer to the action, they would indeed have extensive coverage.  After all, it's not like the Manships don't own or fund an entire university department, a newspaper, at least five radio stations and a television station; they are bound to have some sort of political connections (Yes, that was sarcasm).  A blurb about a debate for the 2-year community college program and the earth shattering news that Hunt Downer was the first candidate to qualify yesterday was the only info I found (Damn, I can't seem to stop).  Moving on, I next consulted with the Times-Picayune.  I was very skeptical about this venture because of an earlier failed attempt a week or two ago, but things were promising when I actually found an election coverage link.  I was at first afronted with news of the CA race, (it is just SO important to us in LA, isn't it?) but a quick scan provided links to each of the major candidates websites.  I'd finally hit pay dirt... YES!  Other than the list of names, there were no stories, not even the one about qualifying.  So, I've since systematically reviewed each candidates website.  Issues are presented in a variety of ways: from the non-existent and general to the concrete and detailed.  Some candidates assume their audience is grossly uneducated in comparison to themselves, thus addressing their constituants as such.  Others take the time to present their ideas concretely in a manner that can be understood by all.  Ultimately, I think many of our candidates are laughing at us behind our backs.  Why are a vast majority of our citizens uneducated?  Because they are treated that way -- "Stupid is as stupid does."  I am scared for this state if every person reacts to the Jay Blossman ad... "Oh, I know him... I saw his commercial, let's vote for him because I don't know anything about anyone else."  Blossman's issues came off as extremely lofty and arrogant.  He addressed a large number of issues, including some controversial things like abortion and 2nd amendment rights.  His arguments were trite and obvious in their aim to merely gain the conservative votes of the state.  He is purposely playing the right keys, such the good little politician, to get the votes he needs, not stating issues he actually believes.  I doubt he has the ability or the integrity to lead the state in the direction it needs.  I was impressed with Lt. Governor Kathleen Blanco.  She organized her issues is an excellent manner, going from the general, abstract ideas of education, economic, and healthcare reform to more specific, action plans for each issue.  She most definitely has more experience; she has been second in line for 8 years now.  Her ideas are more realistic than most other candidates because she has a better understanding of the what and how of accomplishing change within state government.  She ultimately has something that every other candidate lacks: womanhood.  Not to sound feminist, but I think now is the time to seek out and elect the female perspective into our governor's office.  Yeah, genderizing isn't exactly PC, but I doubt anyone can argue against the fact that women see things from a different perspective than men.  Not demeaning, just a fact.  What Louisiana needs now is a different perspective, and Kathleen Blanco could provide that.  This view could change in the coming months.  I, for one, plan to keep a very close eye on what's going on in this year's election because it's outcome is integral to the growth and improvement of this state.  I'd like to see this state change, so I (like so many before me) won't be forced to move in search of the bigger and better.

      So, I have reaffirmed my weight-loss plan.  Not doing Atkins... I got sick way too much for my taste.  Instead, I've decided to do it the right way, and to take everything one step at a time.  Right now, I am focusing on portion control -- making sure I eat a proper serving size of everything.  I know I eat mostly low-fat, low- cal stuff... I just eat too much of it!  I am being sure to formulate my meals around that little pyramid we've all been taught since first grade.  If I can say one positive thing about Atkins, it did show me how important every thing on the pyramid truly is.  I'm also getting religious about taking my vitamins in the morning.  My goal weight is 115 lbs, which should place me into a size 6 again.  Right now, I am holding steady at a size 18.  I hope to lose one size by the end of September.  My more short term goal is to be out of the plus sizes by Christmas time, which should put me at 20 lbs. of weight loss, if I lose 1 lb. per week beginning this week.  This sounds like a reasonable expectation to me.  I am not beginning a formal exercise plan yet.  Instead, I am focusing on merely being active instead of sedentary.  Housework, especially with Trey around, can be exercise too!  Basically, this is the only thing I can fit in right now.  So, I am trying to do more housework regularly instead of waiting for the weekend to clean EVERYTHING.  Also doing the easier things... taking the stairs instead of the elevator and parking further from the door so I can get a little walking time.  I think with time, and more energy than I have now, I will be able to work up to a more formal exercise ritual.  I just don't like exercising alone, and I hate paying to exercise, so I need to hook-up with an exercise buddy.  I keep saying I am going to walk around the block with Trey in tow but that hasn't happened yet; I think I am afraid of getting attacked or something.  My mission of getting Ted inspired to walk with me hasn't been very effective, so I am giving up.  (I am quite sure he will argue this point, which he always does... don't bother, I'm not accusing you of anything, just stating a fact from my side of the fence.)  Ted and I also started the Casa Newfield Fund.  To help us save for a downpayment on our house, we've created some "fines."  For example, if either one of us curse in front of Trey (he's become a little parrot, you know), we have to pay a quarter.  If either of us gain any weight, we have to pay $5.  There are all kinds of other things as well.  When we host Wrestling PPVs, the entrance fee will go straight into our piggy bank as well.  We plan to deposit the cash into our savings account when the pig is filled.  I think this is will be a fun way to encourage us to save money.  Donations will also be accepted, of course ;-)  I think I was Greek or some other Meditteranean culture in a former life.  I love the food from that region!  I just got two new cookbooks yesterday and I can't wait to try them:  Modern Greek and The Essential Meditteranean.  I look forward to finding some new low-cal, low-fat dishes in these two books.  Anyone want to come over an eat??

      So, I've been helping Bobby plan the kitchen portion of Tioga this year.  Made some lists and passed on some files for the past several years dating back to the Anne O. days.  We've pretty much come to the conclusion that we need an alternative food option for the vegetarians in our district.  Lunch is easy if jambalaya remains... just delete the meat.  However, dinner is the traditional steak and many passed this option last year.  SO, does anyone know any good dishes that can be prepared easily, can be multiplied easily if needed, and is relatively cheap to prepare?  I'm thinking and researching, but I'd like some input.  If you have any suggestions, please  urlLink e-mail me  ASAP with the recipie.  I'd like to test it first to make sure I can make an edible rendition...  THANKS!

      Well, today I grew one year older.  I am now exactly a quarter of a century... getting old!  Didn't do much today... my dad came into town, brought us a new couch, and then we went out to eat.  Ted got me a new perfume that I have been wanting, Ralph Lauren Romance, and Lauren sent me a card... thanks Lauren!  Paul and Michelle also mailed me a card earlier this week... THANKS!  My mom will be coming into town next Saturday for some shopping, which promises to be fun.  Today, Ted and I saw THE shaguar of Austin Power fame.  I am not kidding!  It was a convertible Jaguar complete with the British union jack flag.  I saw it not once, but twice just driving down Clearview Pkwy... very weird thing to see.  Don't know what that was all about, but Ted and I just stared in shock the first time we saw it!  WOW!  Ted's dad came home late Friday night.  He has a nurse who will visit him daily to administer an I.V. as well as a PT, but he is very glad to be away from the hospital after two weeks.  Things are looking better on that front.  Ted's mom should start school as planned Wednesday, as a third grade teacher instead of fifth.  This may be her last year at her current school... she is still debating.  Saints won Saturday... woohoo!  LSU smacks ULM in two weeks... YEAH!  I am SO ready for football season.  GO TIGERS!!

      Wow!  We purchased a wireless router and notebook adapter today from OfficeMax, so we are riding the waves of wireless internet now.  It's pretty cool.  We got a great deal on the two items, both Microsoft branded, saving us roughly $50 for the purchase.  And before anyone flames me on purchasing Microsoft -- we've used the wired base station before with less problems then the other brands, like Lynksys.  Microsoft really did get something right here... I know, it is shocking, but true.  Also, I downloaded the google toolbar, which has a pop-up blocker integrated right into it.  I recommend downloading this because it actually works!  I have Norton Internet Security, which has the crappiest ad blocker ever made, so I am enjoying the pop-up free time online.  Even cooler, there is a button called "BlogThis!" which allows you to bring up a mini blog screen to type your blog.  A real quick way to make quick notes on your blog.  Visit  urlLink Google.com  to download the toolbar.

      Life goes on.  I'm pretty much over myself for now.  I guess I needed to vent for a bit; it helped.  I know I do have THE best friends in the whole world... thank you!  Now, how about this power outage business up in yankee land.  Sadly, I find it amusing in a way (which is SO wrong) because it just proves how dependent we all are on electricity.  Of course, if the same would have happened here... why we would have all just broken out the hurricane stash and had a party.  I don't think loss of power would put us New Orleanians in such a panic because we are prepared for that instance with all the tropical type weather we get.  Funny enough, the NOLA.com server is down as a part of this mess.  While I will not ask why the nola server is run in New York, I will point out that a very funny blog has been put in its place.  Since the beginning of the day, this person (or persons) has been scanning the internet for any sort of coverage -- often resorting to sarcastic commentary such as:    3 p.m. Eastern   What's the over-under on the time it will take radio talker Sean Hannity to blame the Northeast blackout on Bill Clinton?   It is always good to know that some people are keeping their sense of humor throughout this.

      I haven't been feeling too great lately... sort of detached from everything going on around me.  I feel sad at the strangest times and I can't explain why, nor can I seem to do anything about it.  Also, I keep saying things that I don't mean... I realize it as I say it, yet I can't seem to stop myself.  I think ultimately I feel like I've lost all control over everything in my life.  My dieting that I was so hyped about has failed; now I am back to where I began pretty much.  Just one more thing I can't seem to control.  When I was in junior high, all my "friends" abandoned me after some boy spread a rumor that I stuffed my bra.  That was in seventh grade, and it wasn't until I moved to Baton Rouge two years later that I finally lost the stigma of being called "Charmin."  Before that, it was the girl who "fart on berries," so I can't say it was a new thing to feel.  Can you imagine a lifetime of being picked on? Of never being "good enough"?  I know it was childish and immature.  I know this, but it still hurt because these were people I trusted... people I believed were my friends.  I learned early to be afraid of things like trust, feelings, and friendship.  I've made the realization that most people I know now don't like me and it's my fault not theirs. I am deeply sorry and troubled by this.  I've become what I despised as a young child as a defense mechanism and I want to do something about this... to change myself into a better person.  It's hard.  I know this; I think we all know it and that's why we don't want to do it.  I'm afraid too, because making that change will make me vulnerable just like I was when I was younger.  My youthful vulnerability is what has mutated me into what I don't like about myself now.  Such a vicious circle.  And the control issue comes into play again -- I can't control what other people think or feel about me.  I think I feel like I've come to the end of my rope on this.  It's the only way I can explain why I am even thinking of posting these feelings for public knowledge.  Maybe I should stop trying to control my life and just let life do its work.  I think I've unconsciously focused so much on making sure I protect myself, that I've lost touch with the same things I try to hide from everyone else.  Maybe I just need to admit that I don't know the answer, for a change.

      Yesterday, my father-in-law's blood count was down to 4, which is bad, I think.  So, Ted's dad went into surgery this morning at 7:30 a.m. to remove the contaminated shunt which has been causing the infection.  He is now finished and in recovery.  Doctors think he will be able to go home as early as Friday.  Meanwhile, as if nothing worse can happen, my mother-in-law has been ousted from her school.  So, as of right now she is technically unemployed, eventhough OPSB is required to pay her because of the contract she recently signed.  Don't know what is going on with that, but it involves the teacher's union, a new school prinicipal, and all sorts of other BS.  Gotta love the Orleans Parish School Board.

      Ted and I went to Baton Rouge last night for Paul's birthday.  Their house is really looking great!  We had a nice meal with them, visited, then headed back to Metairie at around 9 p.m.  On the way home, we stopped for a brief visit with my dad since he will probably not be able to visit this weekend for my birthday.  So, this pushed us back to leaving Prairieville/Baton Rouge at 11 p.m.    Did you know that the State Troopers have a number to call to report drunk driving from your cell phone?  I've seen this on any number of signs up and down Alabama's interstate system, but an equivalent here has always eluded me until last night.  No, it isn't *HP.. it's *577.  Thank you to the 911 lady for giving me this info.  I would like to especially thank the Louisiana State Police for their vigilence against drunk drivers last night.  After Ted called the police on this grey crown vic driving crazy over the spillway, the trooper politely said he couldn't do anything about it, but they would be sure to be more vigilent.  And where might this vigilence have taken place, because I sure didn't see any of you around!  Thank you Mr. State Trooper for making me feel safe.  To cop from Monty Python, "And now for something completely different," I found this cartoon by Rex Babin that pretty much describes my opinion on the California Recall thing:    urlLink

      This weekend was pretty relaxing, for a change.  I left the house a total of two times the entire weekend, and this was all on Saturday.  It felt good, to say the least.  I left once to pick-up some Krispy Kreme...mmmm, definitely worth the trip.  Later that day, we left for N.O. East to go and clean my in-laws house... not so fun.  I did get the chance to have the unique experience of the Crowder Blvd. Family Dollar store.  All I have to say is this:  they are the last known store to  NOT  take credit cards; and do not help illiterate people find the disposable cameras... they will tell you way more than you need to know... way more.  Bloomer moved in Saturday night and started her insulin Sunday.  I was VERY nervous about giving her the shot, but it really wasn't that hard, especially since she didn't even notice I was doing it!  2 days worth of injections down with no problem.  Now, what do I do with the used syringes??  I have really bad dreams of hypodermics washing up on some beach or something, so I'm keeping them in a bag on top of the fridge until I think of a good solution -- maybe take them to a vet for proper disposal.    HAPPY BIRTHDAY to PAUL NEWFIELD   Even though my brother-in-law never reads these blogs, thought I would wish him a happy day anyway.  My birthday is coming up shortly as well... this Sunday, August 17, to be exact.  I'll be a quarter of a century.. boo hoo...  I don't plan on doing anything, but I may have to go to Baton Rouge... I dunno.  Birthdays just aren't the same after you hit 21... The next weekend, my mom comes in town for a birthday shopping trip -- YEAH!

      Ted's father is not doing so hot.  They thought he was improving yesterday.  All of his vitals had returned to normal, but then he went into convulsions and then catatonic for about half an hour or so yesterday afternoon.  Doctor on duty says it was due to an extreme drop in blood pressure from over-exerting himself (he got up to go to the bathroom on his own for the first time since Saturday).  I can only assume that this mimics a stroke... blood isn't pumping fast enough so oxygen doesn't get to the brain.  Doctor also says he suffers from sleep apnea which can lead to depression, which he is definitely suffering from.  After the episode, his temp went back up to 103 so I can say the medical team at Methodist officially has no clue what is going on.  Today, they are taking him to surgery to remove part of the shunt from the stomach in hopes that this will rid the body of infection.  I have my doubts about this, but I don't have a medical degree so we shall see the results.

      Well, jury duty was a big let down yesterday.  I drove all the way to the "wank" to sit in a very uncomfortable chair next to people I did not know for a measly hour and a half.  The good ole clerk of court computer pulled in 130+ people yesterday, with only 9.. .no wait 2... no wait 1 judge actually looking to try something (Yes, this is exactly how the morning went).  I was one of the lucky 85 let go at 10AM, and I still don't have to serve for at least another two years!!  YEAH!  While waiting, I got in some quality reading time... so much that I went home and read some more.  My mother and mother-in-law were right, those Janet Evanovich novels are fantastic... so much so that I read the first two installments yesterday... and started on the third!  WOW!  Stephanie Plum, the heroine is this series, is a bumbling, smart-assed, and independent female who just took a job as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinny.  What I like best about this series is Evanovich's ability to give the reader description without taking away from the action.  I hate novels that have miles and miles of description-- which is why I hate reading Anne Rice -- IT'S SO BORING!!  So, these books are a very quick read.  I think I may put aside Harry Potter for a few days until I get tired of reading about Stephanie Plum.  Lucky for me, when I showed at work this morning I discovered that I need to pack my entire office.  Apparently, changing the carpet is catching in corporate world (see  urlLink Matt's Blog ).  Supposedly, the bulk of this will be done over the weekend, but they will be starting the job later today (They are also knocking out a few walls as well).  This sucks for a variety of reasons.  First, I hate packing... its just way too stressful to be so organized.  Second, the carpet has been here for quite awhile...  carpets trap tons of dust...  I am allergic to dust.  I've had this happen when Sidney decided to change the carpet in the Purchasing Department at Loyola, it isn't pretty.  So, I will not be surprised if I leave claiming breathing problems either today or Monday.  Thirdly, my work is mainly done on a computer... in my office.  I have no clue how this will work.

      Not much going on today, and no news on my father-in-law's condition.  We basically have to wait for the infection to do away before anything can be decided about the shunt itself.  Tomorrow is jury duty in Gretna and I expect to get lots of reading done during my wait.  I'm going to start the Stephanie Plum series with "One for the Money."  It is not my usual genre, but both my mom and mother-in-law insist I will like it so I bought the set in hardcover when it was made available to me very cheap.  I'm halfway through "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and will probably finish that tonight or tomorrow night.  I've decided to alternate between the two series because I get bored reading about the same characters after awhile, like with J.D. Robb's Eve Dallas series, which I am still trolling through.  Soon, I will look into some Dante, but I'm waiting to find a good translation that includes the original Italian text, not that I can read Italian.  Well, at least not anymore than what I learned in my one week of Italian 1001 at LSU, but I plan to learn one day.  I even have Pinocchio in Italian for when that time comes!  Ted had off today, so he met me for lunch.  We went to eat at this new Asian cafe on S. Clearview called Zue Zee Zam.  For those fans of healthy, fresh Asian cuisine, this is definitely the place for you!  This place was fantastic and original; a definite winner in my book.  The restaurant serves a refreshing mix of familiar items, like Chicken Teriaki and fried rice, and different flavors, like the Thai Basil Chicken or Fried Tofu.  The prices are pretty reasonable -- a lunch plate of two different and decent-sized entree servings with a side of rice (steamed jasmine rice or fried) or lo-mein and a choice of soup or salad is $7.  All of their dinner entrees are priced under $15.  Everything there is fresh and the food is abundantly seasoned with authentic spices and herbs... mmm.  Ted didn't even have to add soy sauce to anything (except the rice), which is saying something for him.  They also serve lots of specialty drinks, like Thai Iced Tea, a concoction of cream, honey, and who knows what else (it was pretty good).  Unfortunately, the served no sushi (I love sushi!), but they did have edamame and several vegetarian tofu dishes.  I'm looking forward to some Shrimp Pad Thai when I return!

      Ted's dad has finally been diagnosed.  He is in the early stages of developing bacterial meningitis and is very lucky to have been brought to the hospital when he was.  It is possible that this was caused by the shunt, in which case it will have to be removed and redone.  He is far from out of the woods, but at least we are all more confident because we actually know what he is facing, rather than conjecturing on a mystery illness.  Being faced with life and the possibility of death has put me in a philosophcal mood lately.  Ted often accuses me of thinking too much, which is often true, but I can't really help it.  And anyway, without people who think too much, like me, we never would have a better handle on the world around us.  For me, in as little as a weekend I've learned a few basic principles about life that I would like to share.  First, God or the ultimate higher being, whichever it may be, is vengeful and will eventually get around to teaching you a lesson you should have learned the first time around.  Case in point:  While I was employed by both Delchamps (through May 1997) and Albertsons (through July 1999), I worked with an older woman, Ms. Rose.  Some that read this may know who I am talking about.  To shed some light for those who don't, allow me to describe her.  She is your typical older, single female.  About 60 years of age, she lives alone with her cats and has done so for several years; her husband passed on many moons ago.  She has also been a lifelong check-out clerk at a supermarket near you, or in this case any Delchamps within a 50 mile radius of SE Baton Rouge.  She isn't quite all there; rumor has it that she was hit by a car in a Delchamps parking lot.  She is quirky... loves her pets like children.  She is the type of woman who takes her cats to see Santa (and has pictures to prove it).  Now that we've got the picture, here is the story.  Ms. Rose's oldest cat, named Nu-nu, was a serious diabetic requiring large doses of insulin several times a day.  Ms. Rose, loving her pet, worked two jobs, one in the early mornings at Burger King, the other at the supermarket, in order to subsidize what you can imagine was a huge pet health bill.  She called BK her cat money.  This wasn't the worst of it either, you see she had her day planned down to the exact minute -- her lunch breaks gave her enough time to give Nu-nu his injections and if she was late, why that would put Nu-nu in a critical state.  You can probably imagine the joking that went on about Ms. Rose.  At the time, it seemed so nonsensical and absurd to be planning your life around an animal.  Payback is a bitch.  Bloomer, my cat for over seven years was diagnosed with diabetes on Friday.  Go figure!  So now, she has to go on a special low-carb diet (I've dubbed it the Atkins Diet for Cats) and have a small injection of human insulin daily.  She has been staying with Ted's parents, but she will soon be moving back in with us (I got special permission from my landlord).  Payback...  Will I be planning my day around my cat?  I don't think so, but it does give me a better understanding of Ms. Rose's situation and makes me guilty as hell for making fun of her!    The second thing I've learned is about life and free will.  Remember those "Choose Your Own Adventure" books from elementary school?  In the course of the novel, the reader came to different points where he/she had to make a choice.  The outcome of the book was ultimately based on which paths were chosen.  I've decided that life is much like this in a way.  God, or the "Ultimate", has already written our "adventure" with all these complex courses in which we can follow.  I guess some might call this pre-destination, but I don't think God ultimately decides where our ending point will be; that is left to our own free will.  Each time we make a decision, or practice our free will, we are flipped to a new page in the book, so to speak.  Based upon our choices, we are set upon a path to a certain pre-determined end, but at any moment that end can change to another, depending once again upon our choice.    This thought process is practical when applied to real life.  For example, think of a time when you thought about doing something, but decided against it.  Later you heard something horrible had happened to those who went, while you remained safe.  This could also happen in reverse.  For me, in high school I use to attend bi-weekly lessons with my clarinet instructor.  Before one such lesson, I was napping... dreaming that my dad (who I did not live with) was telling me to not drive to my lesson because I was too tired.  On the way to the lesson, I got in my first accident because I didn't see a car and pulled out in front of it.  While the coincidence of the message in the dream and the incident were completely weird, I obviously made a choice and chose a path which I suffered for (by not having a car for awhile; and by completely sucking for my LSU audition the following day).  There have been other choices that I've personally made that have altered my outcome in life as well.  Tying this in to all sorts of faiths seems logical to me as well.  In the Christian world, your choices place you any level of hell or redemption, from heaven all the way down to the pits of hell.  A buddhist may work their way closer to enlightenment, etc, etc.  The possibilities for application are endless.   I am sure I am not the first person to think of this, but I am happy that I've been enlightened with the thought.  It has changed my outlook on life and makes me more aware of how what I do or say effects everything around me.

      I hate the UF Gators... maybe it is because one of the colors is orange (yech), but I'm pretty sure its for another reason.  So, when I took the UF quiz from  urlLink Ali's Blog , I was quite disturbed by my results (which I will not disclose).  So, I made my own quizie for those who love LSU... even those that don't.  I scored a  87%  on the "Do You Bleed Purple and Gold?" Quizie!  urlLink What about you?    I also found this one for all you LSU students out there:  I scored a  90%  on the "How LSU Are You?" Quizie!  urlLink What about you?   Thank you all for your continued thoughts and prayers.  Still no word on what's going on with Ted's dad, although they are suppose to be investigating the shunt today, maybe taking some spinal fluid.  He is still running a high fever and has bouts when he is very disoriented (not to mention frustrated and angry because of everything), so I hope they find a solution soon.    On other news, I've been called for jury duty on Thursday.  This will be my very first time.  Unlike most people, I don't really mind going; I feel it is my duty as a citizen.  It does suck that I won't be getting paid for my time out from work.  I am only a temporary contractor, so I do not get a jury duty benefit.  Good thing is that Jefferson Parish jury duty is only for one day, unless you get picked for a jury.  Things are far different in Orleans Parish.  I would really enjoy the experience of being on a jury, but now is not the best time for that to happen, so here's to hoping I don't get picked on Thursday!

      Ted and I are tired of paying for MSN on top of our broadband connection, so we have changed our e-mail addresses for the last time (hopefully).  My new e-mail is  urlLink NewfieldBella@cox.net .  Ted's e-mail will be  urlLink Ted_Newfield@cox.net .  For those who deal with the LaMissTenn Alumni Association, that address will be changing shortly as well, most likely to a Yahoo! account.  I will keep you posted.  The doctors have still not identified what exactly Ted's father is suffering from, though they have nearly narrowed it down to an infection within the brain itself.  Right now, he is hospitalized at Methodist in NO East, waiting for his usual doctor to come in on Monday.

      Ted's father was taken to the hospital today.  It appears that his brain shunt, which he received a few months ago, is not working as it should.  Also,  there is an infection in either the stomach or the brain.  He is currently in the ER at Methodist Hospital in NO East undergoing testing.  We would really appreciate your thoughts and prayers at this time.  Thanks!

      It is official.  People within the University of Florida football program are idiots.  While this is certainly not earth shattering news (some of us have known this for a long time), many of you may agree that it is good that the fact is now "out of the closet" so to speak.  For those who have not heard, the UF football people are getting lambasted following the realization that there is a crocodile, not an alligator, featured on the cover of this year's football media guide.  Yes, apparently someone in the PR department lost their mind, or their attention to detail, and failed to notice the obvious mistake.  I would even go so far as say, they tried real hard to hide it after the fact.  As this  urlLink article  on ESPN states, the media guide features a picture of the crocodile with the team (and Zook) superimposed on top.  The title reads simply Florida Football... no mention of the real mascot.  I guess they figured the Florida fans would be as stupid as the PR people were to actually PURCHASE (yes, I said purchase) a photo of a croc instead of a gator.     Looking beyond the simple fact that a university the size of UF does not have millions of photos of gators to chose from, one has to wonder about the quality of education here.  Mistaking a croc for a gator is like mistaking a leopard for a tiger here in LSU land.  Even worse, there are tons of gators all over the area down there; they are in the middle of a freakin' swamp!  The hick dweebs here in Louisiana would at least have a tiny excuse... tigers aren't something you see running around the wilds of Lousiana.  For once, I am happy to say.. Louisiana is not on the losing side of the stupidity stick here.  Everyone everywhere, from Shreveport to Cutoff, should be patting their back on this one!  So here's to the UF Crocodiles -- may their season be fraught with losses, particularly in Death Valley!

      So obviously, I am getting ready for the impending college football season.  More obvious is the fact that I've figured some things out with the whole HTML thing... GO ME!  So, for now we have LSU.  After football season, I may go for some Maroon and Gold action ALA Loyola University, but this suits my mood for now.  Can you tell I'm ready for some tailgating????

      I went to a DeLaSalle football game, homecoming no doubt, this past Friday night.  The game was dreary for the Cavalier fan; they were throughly thumped by Holy Cross.  Can't remember the score because I really wasn't paying attention.  Common consensus: must have more liquor before any future games.  Fact learned: According to the Pre-game prayer, Jesus played football and expects everyone to uphold the game just as he would.  Jesus is, of course, a DeLaSalle fan.  Astonishing factoid: they sell beer at Tad Gormley Stadium.  The Baton Rouge Baptist congregation would be appalled!  I don't understand why you can drink at a HS game in New Orleans, but not at an LSU game in Baton Rouge!  (NCAA rules suck!)  Now, I was preoccupied the entire game by several young men flitting about the stands dressed in dance line and cheerleader uniforms.  Now anyone with a marching band or cheering squad can probably picture what I'm talking about: tight and glittery maroon and silver leotards or the usual cheering attire.  Okay, I can still remember back to high school (luckily).  During homecoming week, we had some pretty mean initiation activities for Freshman (read: first year) members of the dance line, flag corps, drum line, cheering squad, and football team.  It was usually an all night affair that included egg wars about the area, rolling (toilet papering) the school, lack of sleep and other general acts of vandalism and foolishness (rolling in the oil-filled McDonald's parking lot before school).  During the day, us "normal" students were subjected to people "assuming the position" (think dead cochroach) and smelling of deer pherenome (pee-pee, my friends).  Of course, we had the stupid outfits, etc., etc.  I;ve seen everything embarassing that could happen during an initiation.  NEVER, in my three years at Woodlawn, was any male EVER forced to dress as a woman.  The fact is, I don't think these guys were forced either.  This made me snicker all evening long.  These young men clearly are not afraid of what others think.  As for the rest of the weekend: LSU won... yeah for them!  I'm looking forward to the next few games... actual competition.  I think Florida will be the best game yet this season.  The remainder of my weekend was spent cleaning and relaxing.  I've finally started scrapbooking; finished a whole three pages last night!  If anyone is interested in getting together for some scrapbooking time, let me know.  It's fun to get together and share!   Elections are this weekend and I still haven't decided on a LTG.  Can anyone pass on their opinions?

      *SIGH* Such has been my fantasy season so far.  I drafted an injured quarter back, Michael Vick.  I picked up Patrick Ramsey and Kurt Warner, dropping some QB named Jon Kitna and placing Vick in IR.  Kurt Warner sucked (and took another whack to the head).  Dumped him faster than a nasty ex for Daunte Culpepper (YEAH!).  Got rid of Patrick Ramsey for some reason and re-signed Jon Kitna as back-up (temporary insanity?).  That was all between the first and second week.  I was doing great.  I lost my second game barely (104 to 102 or something like that)  Tweaked my defense last week (Phili sucks!) and beat the crap out of last week's opponent.  Now, we are in Week 4. *SIGH*  Daunte has broken several bones in his back.. OUCH!  I think it is safe to say he's out for awhile, despite what he might say.  On ESPN's fantasy poll, he's been the #2 QB; Patrick Ramsey is #1.  DOH!  Luckily, he's still available... YEAH ME!!  The fact that Patrick Ramsey is now my quarterback scares me.  I am basically trusting the livelihood my team to a member of Steve Spurrier's player staff!! YIKES!  Common sense tells me that Spurrier is a big playmaker, which is probably why Ramsey's numbers are so impressive, but still, the idea scares me!  We shall see how Ramsey hold up against the New England defense this week.  *SIGH* Patty-boy, I need your help; you are my only hope.  Meanwhile, I was browsing the Gap website, looking at jeans.  Did you know they have this new "limited edition" line of jeans?  The 1969 collection are NEW jeans made to look like 34 years old jeans and cost an arm and a leg (as far as Gap jeans are concerned).  The description for these jeans is funny to say the least: Made from a premium denim fabric that is extremely washed down with holes, patches and grinding for the ultimate worn denim look. Handwork also includes subtle whiskers, hand tacking at front pockets, as well as subtle dirt and oil spots.  Yes, you read this right... subtle dirt and oil spots??? These jeans sell for around $100 and they are DIRTY!!  What the hell is up with that?!?!?  Do you think this is what our parents feel like?  Ugh, I feel old!

      I am pleased to see that Louisiana was actually not listed last on a list... finally.  The report: quality of hospitals.  The ranking: 28 out of 51.  (Yes, I can count.  This study includes the District of Columbia) Not bad, I say.  My info comes from an article on  urlLink MSN .  Once again, we in Louisiana can rejoice at being ahead of our neighbors in something: Texas was 30th; Arkansas, Alabama, and Mississippi were ranked 49,50, and 51 respectively.  The study says that 49% more people will die from a heart attack in Mississippi then in #6 ranked Colorado!  So be forewarned, if you plan to have a heart attack or emergency surgery, don't be in Mississippi!!  ;-)  All joking aside, healthcare has been a topic of debate in the state's elections as well.  Mainly, what to do with the ailing charity hospital system our state has.  Should we get rid of this system, in favor of dividing funds amongst other thriving community hospitals and educational/research hospitals (like LSU Med School)?  What do you think?

      This week has been strange.  I've been working amongst whispers about the hiring my department is doing right now.  I have not gotten a chance to interview, nor am I likely to get the chance.  Thanks to a 51-person layoff a week ago today, there were plenty of internal applicants (yes, the lay-offs got the chance to apply as employees).  I keep hoping they decided to not choose any of the internal applicants, but that is very slim, so I've resigned myself to the fact that this opportunity is lost onto me.  Hopefully, something else will come along.  On a good note, the new season of The West Wing began last night.  I've been over-anxious since the end of last season, so I am definitely relieved that it is finally here.  A little different now that the original writer/creator, Aaron Sorkin, is no longer on staff.  I was a little disoriented by the new feel... then again, that could have been because Ted kept yelling "You don't do that!" to the television each time the interim pres. (John Goodman) moved in new furniture or consulted his staff over the actual White House staff.  Someone should teach my husband that the people on t.v. can't hear him.  I've tried, but it doesn't seem to work.  ;-)  A fun weekend ahead for me as well.  Nothing but cleaning, cleaning, and more cleaning.  Did I mention that I hate doing housework?  Now that Bloomer is gone, I need to work on getting the house back into order.  That's my project this weekend, so oh boy.  Oh, but wait, there is the DLS homecoming game that I will be attending Friday night... what fun.    Oh geez, a rant insues: Can some local person, other than my husband, explain this to me because I don't understand.  What is the big deal about high school sports in this city??  Geez, it is high school for crying out loud!  Sure, I'd donate money to my school, and I would certainly be happy if I heard they were winning, but to follow each game on AM radio?  Um, I'm not putting up any extra effort to find out how Woodlawn is doing (I think I asked once..), much less calling home to "check the score."  I definitely don't understand how with TWO major NCAA universities in this city, a high school can get better attendance at a sporting event than the universities!  Even 106.7 is ga-ga over prep sports... they are giving away an ultimate fan ticket pack which includes all the appropriate major professional and collegiate sporting events... and GRACE KING FOOTBALL TICKETS??  What the...?  I just don't get it.  As you can tell, I am feeling quite sarcastic this fine morning.  It is best that I end here, so I can save myself from getting in any more trouble.

      This is my philosophy: stupid people shouldn't breathe!  They certainly should NOT be put into positions that require the utmost in attention and correctness.  Today at work, the e-mail notification tool in our learning management system was turned on and because it found tons of overdue training needs (798 to be exact), it sent e-mails alerting these overdue users of their deficiencies.  Mass anger and several mean phone calls insued.  I, of course, was sent to the task of verifying that everything was indeed correct.  It was, except for those errors made by the same people making the phone calls.  Now, I will have to go to work tomorrow and find a way to nicely tell these people that they are wrong and they need to fix their errors.  Stupid people shouldn't breathe...

      My, my, how the Tigers do climb.  The LSU Tigers, after a nail-biting win over UGA, are now solidly No. 7 on both the AP and ESPN polls.  Now that the REAL part of the season has begun, I am excited and anxious to see more games like this past week's game.  Next week, LSU is facing Mississippi State, a team that is having problems... major problems.  This team is 0-3, having lost to U of Houston this past week.  HOUSTON???  This team scored 21 unanswered points in the first quarter!  As long as the Tigers don't let this big win over UGA go to their heads, we should see another win ala Arizona.  I can't wait for the UF game!  If anyone has tickets they may have to part with (yeah, right), please inquire in my direction.  I'd be more than willing to relieve you of your burden ;-)  Fantasy Football is finally going my way.  After two weeks worth of losses... okay last week was close (106 - 103).. I've finally WON A GAME!!  YEAH!!  I scored in the ninties this week, apparently blowing everyone in our league out of the water, so I am confident that I've finally found the right combination... at least for now.  Another virus has hit the lanes of the information superhighway.  The worm, WORM_SWEN.A, poses as an official looking Microsoft e-mail that claims to have a service patch attached.

        Bloomer      1995 - September 20, 2003     Bloomer, my cat for seven years, sadly passed away this morning from complications due to diabetes.  She was approximately eight years old at the time of her death.  My senior year of high school, my mom had seen this beautiful cat on a local morning news show.  The channel would often highlight animals at the SPCA shelter to encourage people to adopt.  I jumped at the opportunity to skip a day of class to pick a new pet!  When we arrived at the SPCA, when went to see the cat.  She had a very silky black and white coat, but not a good disposition.  My mom loved the way she felt, like silken thread, she said.  We chose her for my mom and another Siamese kitten for my brother and me.  We went home with our two new family members.  Two things became quickly apparent.  First, the new cat, who went through names like Silky, liked to eat flowers.  Her name was promptly changed to Bloomer, and would remain so for the duration.  Second, this cat disliked everyone!  You certainly couldn't hold her, or have her sit on your lap, which is what my mom wanted.  So, Bloomer became the cat who needed Prozac.  Several months later, we garnered a new addition to our home.  A work associate of mine was giving away her Himalayan, the type of cat I've always wanted.  His name was J.P. (Just a Pussycat) and he was to be my new pet.  Well, since cats will be perverse; things didn't turn out as we had planned.  Bloomer had gradually warned to me over the last few months.  She did quirky things like run her head through my hair (only for me) and let me pet and hold her on occasion.  It seemed that she had chosen me.  This began our time together.  In recent years, Bloomer has split time between Ted's parents and my home.  She's gone through several moves, a skin infection that left her practically hairless, and now the diabetes.  I am comforted in knowing that she had mellowed in her older age, becoming the lap cat I'd always wanted.  Sadly, I took her to the vet yesterday because she didn't look very good.  She had a diabetic seizure this morning and passed.  She will be missed.

      Well, it is just another Tuesday here.  Ted got a ticket this morning for not having an inspection sticker (yeah, I don't call it a brake tag, because it's not!).  It is my fault, because I've never gotten it done since the "accident" at Tioga.  Unbelievably, we've been stopped several times (insurance checks, etc.) and/or been involved in accidents and never had any comments about it.  Obviously, NOPD needs money so they must pick on the lowly people instead of fighting real crime.  F-em!  You would not believe how much they charge for this!  I think Ted will go to court because I have a feeling the policeman won't.  Anyway, if you live outside NOLA and need an inspection sticker... maybe you car won't pass inspection from some reason... then again, maybe it will, but you are short on time, go see the inspection man on Jeff Hwy.  It's a large pink place before the funky curves, but right after Ochsner.  He's open M-F, 9-5,but closes for lunch from 11-12.  This man is cool.  You give him you liscense, registration and insurance.  He writes up the paperwork.  You sign.  He takes off the old and puts on the new.  There is no "inspection."  He is usually watching television as he works.  This place rocks!  Anyway, the CR-V is now inspected and NOPD can kiss my ass!  Also, isn't it nice to know that your neighbor is a pothead.  I know this because going to Woodlawn (pronounced Weedlawn) certainly familiarized me with the smell of the wacky tobaccy.  Last Friday, I definitely caught a strong whiff of eau de marijuana.  I guess he was paying homage to the infamous movie series with his friend who kept parking in my parking spot!  What is even nicer is that this man is my landlord's son.... oh yeah, he's married with one child and another on the way.  Nice, upstanding citizens.  It pisses me off because the smell gets into the back of my house and yech... stale weed smell is more disgusting then its tobacco cousin.

      Well hello everyone!  Just a little update.  I found out today that they posted a job in my department internally.  The job title is Training Analyst and is pretty close to what I do now, except more technically intensive (C++, JAVA, HTML and Database experience).  It is a technical writing position, which is what I definitely want.  Pay starts at over 40K and tops out at over 60K!  I think I'd be a great fit, but I can't apply for it yet.  The position closes on the 19th, so please keep me in mind and hope that not many people apply!  Everyone in HR knows that I am interested, and I'll be able to apply if they don't get too much interest internally.  So, cross your fingers and hope I can get this permanent gig!

      This Saturday, I was charged with representing Ted early in the day.  His uncle Roy "Big Daddy" Wagener (He was a jazz musician who wrote an oldie called "Graduation Day" among others.) passed away last weekend.  In lieu of a funeral (he had his body and usable organs donated to science), a memorial mass was held Saturday morning, followed by the traditional New Orleans funeral bash.  As always, this family gathering was entertaining.  One must understand, with anything involving the LeBlanc side of Ted's family, most of the day consisted of playing "Name That Relative."  You see, Ted's maternal side of the family is rather large and expansive.  There are first cousins who are the same age as Ted's mother; their children are the same age as Ted and I.  Most of these people only come out of the woodwork on particular holidays or other events, and only then if the celebration is near their residence.  These relatives are referred to as the "Northshore" relatives.  Most of the "Southshore" relatives cannot name the "Northshore" relatives, and vice versa.  Even worse, it seems I know more relatives than Ted or his youngest brother Rick!  Yes, this family is way too large.  Oh yeah, the LeBlanc sibilings are primarily a bunch of catty, old women who constantly bicker amongst themselves.  Don't ever get in between these women because they are large and always feel they are in charge.  This side of the family is also a large collection of drunks.  Any excuse to gather and indulge in the family friends Johnny Walker and Jack Daniels is relished.  Now let it be known, that grief and liquor do not mix... ever!  More so, one should never gather too many drunk and grieving people into one room and play "memorial videos" of the dearly departed.  This is a very, very bad idea.  If one finds oneself in this situation, the smartest thing to do is to exit the room immediately.  Trust me, one truly can miss the drunken antics that will insue.  For your reading pleasure, some of the overheard conversations: "Will you two bitches shut up!" "So there's the bitch leaving me behind!"  After escaping the madness, I went home (thank God!) and prepared for my evening.  Ted and I went to Lauren's for a murder mystery dinner along with Matt, Bobby, Alison, Beth and Frank.  We had a great time, and Lauren prepared a swell meal!  I really enjoyed the play acting; my character was Eve.  Alas, I was not a murderess, but I was a call-girl who married my husband while he was still drunk for his nonexistant money!  Woohoo!  I got to try lots of new things, like Pimm's No. 1 Cup (sweetened gin), a fabulous red bordeaux and German riesling, port, sherry, and great cheese!  Best of all, I got to wear a ball gown!  I LOVE dressing up, one of those things left over from childhood I guess.  I've always loved costumes and dressing up, and was so happy to indulge in that on Saturday.  Kudos to Lauren for being an excellent host!  I was also happy to celebrate LSU's victory.  I am looking forward to the Georgia game this weekend.    Sunday was spent watching the Saints win and pre-emptively celebrating my father-in-law's birthday (Ted has to work Wednesday, the actual date).  His family is enjoying the new DVD player and telephone.  Now, it is back to work.  This weekend, Bloomer goes to the vet for a second opinion; she hasn't improved much in the last month.  Afterwards, Trey and I will travel to BR to spend the day with my mom and grandmother.  I think we may dine-out then scrapbook.  Until then...

      Yesterday was an interesting day.  I attended a luncheon at Copeland's yesterday for the company I work for, GEM Technology.  The main office is in Miami, but some of the executives were in town and wanted to meet with the New Orleans group.  Turns out, the executive was the owner of the entire company, and I got to sit right next to him.  It was pretty neat getting to chat with him, and I am definitely pleased in knowing they recognized my name... way cool.  When I returned from lunch, a two hour affair, I walked into my office and discovered my computer had moved!  It seems that our original moving date of Monday was expedited without letting any of us know!  As you can imagine, yesterday and today have been spent moving and acclimating to my new environment (land o' cubicle).  It's weird, and there are still many things I need to do to get myself adjusted.  My back is to the entrance to my cube, which absolutely sucks.  I hate having my back to the door.  I think its a fung shui no-no or something; makes people paranoid.  People are starting to ask if I will apply for the position of a co-worker who is leaving soon.  I think this is a good sign, so look for a very excited post in the coming months.  Other than this, nothing much is going on.  Just trying to look busy because they aren't giving me anything to do right now.

      My thoughts are often revealed to me through music.  Whenever I am thinking about something, I can usually relate it to a feeling I get when listening to a certain piece of music.  As I prepared myself for today, the second anniversary of the 9/11 attack, two songs came to me and gave me pause and a need to reflect.  I read many people's reflections on where they were on September 11, 2001, and kept thinking of an African-Ameircan hymn,  Where You There? , all day yesterday.  The hymn is mournful, respectfully asking: where you there?  Where you there when they crucified my Lord?  This is the opening question.  Where you there when they nailed him to the cross?  The next verse asks.  Where you there when they laid him in his tomb?  This song made me think of my own questions regarding September 11th.  Where you there when the planes hit the buildings?  Where you there when the buildings hit the ground?  Where you there as they dug the many bodies from the tomb of rubble they fell into?  I remember the day clearly.  It was a Tuesday, and I was pregnant and unemployed.  Ted and I were married and living at Frenchman's Wharf in New Orleans East.  He had already left for work at PCR and I was sleeping in, preparing for a job interview later that day.  I got a phone call, I don't remember... maybe 7:30 or 8 a.m., from Ted.  "Turn on the television," he implored of me.  I was upset that he woke me from my sleep and was fully expecting this "important thing" he wanted me to see to be something like Richard Simmons on the Today show or other stupid, unimportant garbage.  What I saw shook me.  It was seconds before the second plane had hit; no one knew what was going on.  We were still innocent, with no knowledge that our livelihood was under attack.  And then the second plane hit, and suddenly the intentions were apparent.  I stood glued to the television after that.  I was watching the Today Show.  After ten minutes, and a plane at the Pentagon.. another in Pennsylvania; I wondered what was next.  Never in my entire life, before or since, have I felt such feelings of trepidation.  I think many others felt the same way.  Still, I was glued to the television as they played the footage of the plane hitting one of the towers, over and over.  It was a destruction worse than any movie could portray.  A living nightmare.     Matt and Katie had a projected view of the smoking towers behind them in the early parts of the broadcast.  I, like many viewers, saw the great fall before even they did.  I sat dumbfounded, in shock.  I somehow found the phone and dialed Ted... "The towers have fallen," I said into the phone.  After that, I went about my day, an ever watchful eye on the television.  I dressed in my suit, met Ted and David for lunch, then went to Saint Charles Avenue Baptist Church for my interview.  They were frantically planning a memorial service for their congregants; everyone mourned.  I got the job, but could feel little joy.  Internally, I sobbed for the world I was bringing my unborn child into.  I had class that night, and since my interview was so nearby, I decided to hangout on campus for awhile.  The class was Deviant Behavior, I thought the conversation would be interesting this evening.  I had the urge to call my mom; she had the urge to talk to me too.  We talked about what had happened, what would happen next.  Meanwhile, the students on campus all walked around in a fog.  People began flooding out of the buildings like zombies... the alarms were blaring.  Someone took advantage of our fear... bomb threats, class cancelled.  We all had no choice, but to go home and mourn for the loss of people and things we did not know, nor would ever have a chance to.  New life tumbled inside me and I was hesitant to look upon that life's future.  The second song, I thought of today.  It is one of my favorites by J.S. Bach,  Come, Sweet Death .  This is what I will think of all day today, and I wanted to share that piece with you all.  I remember playing it my junior year of high school; Frank Wickes was directing.  In the arrangement we played, the clarinets opened the piece with a mournful plea, "Come, soothing Death.  Come sweet repose," as the chorale goes.  I remember him telling us to think of it as making our instrument cry.  This is not a light and frolicing piece, but a request for God to relieve the pain.  I think we all wish God would relieve our pain after two years of living in this new and frightening world.  Not to say that we wish we were dead, just that we wish the suffering and violence in our world today would die.  A rest from war and terror.  I don't know how we can accomplish this, or even if we have the ability to dig ourselves out from the quagmire we have fallen into.  All I can do is pray, "God, send us repose from all our suffering.  Light our way to peace.  Amen."

      Ugh, I am so frustrated right now.  I am playing in this fantasy football league.. I figured, "Hey, why not?  How hard could it be?"  Ha ha... out of the mouth of babes.  I have had NO freakin' clue what I am doing, and have started this season off to a resoundingly sucky start.  It all started with the draft... I drafted Michael Vick as my quarterback because I didn't think to go and adjust my draft picks after he was injured... F#@$!  So, the eternal quest for a QB began.  Since I figured my team was screwed from the get go, I traded some backup sucky QB for Patrick Ramsey (again, another why not?); a few days later I noticed Kurt Warner hanging around the free agency list and swooped him up in place of Jon Kitna.  Good ole K.W. became my starter and P.R. my back-up.  Good ole Kurt indeed.  What the hell happened to the Campbell's Chunky Soup man?  Yeah, I know... he's had his can tossed one too many times; the soup has spoiled.  He was downright embarrassing Sunday!  He had six fumbles...SIX!  Sounds like a freakin' Saints game.  My other offensive players had crap days too because their quarterback sucked and what not.  So far, I've racked up an amazing 45 points, which is shit compared to everyone else in my league.  This leads me to defense.  I drafted the Philadelphia defense, which I was assured was one of the best.  We shall see...  I am having to do all sorts of research for this fantasy stuff too.  I have to look up the players I have and study their stats, study the stats of their next opponent, this way I can decide who to start.  Ted says I am putting too much effort into it, but he doesn't understand that I know NOTHING about most of my players or the teams they play for or against.  All I know is I HATE losing!  On the QB front, Kurt Warner is out.  I traded him to another team in the league for Daunte Culpepper... don't ask.  I did extensive research on most of my other players and I plan to move a few around for the next round of "games."  I am still somewhat confident in my defense, but I am doing some research on my back-up, Tennessee, just in case.  Ugh, this is getting more stressful then school.  I don't want to listen to Ted make fun of me!!

      Ahh... my LSU team made me proud Saturday night.  We are now ranked 11 after a resounding butt whooping over Arizona, who looked like crap!  I tried hard to remember the days when LSU played just as Arizona did last Saturday; it was the only way I could keep from laughing too much.  Jim Hawthorne and team couldn't have made it any harder, either.  About two seconds into the game, I noticed the TBS people were 1) pro-Arizona AND 2) completely crappy.  The switch to 870 AM (I couldn't get 98.1 FM on the radio) was inevitable, and I was not let down for my effort.  For those who missed the witty repartee, I shall recap.  First, playing in Arizona must be like playing in a third world country.  From the announcers' booth, there was no crowd noise (they didn't fix the mic until later in the game) and no hearing the referees throughout the entire game.  Once the "crowd noise mics" started working again, we had the pleasure of listening to the chants of "U of A" (not to be confused with the U.S.A. chant) slowly dwindle as the stadium quickly emptied.  By the end of the game, it was SO quiet; we could hear the Arizona band playing almost pristinely.  Second, the referees were in rare form.  Luckily, so were Jim Hawthorne et al.  Such calls as: "Unsportsmanlike conduct, player giving the fan a high-five." drew comments like: "So, does he still get the penalty if he gives a low-five?"  The best commentary can late in the game, as the LSU announcing triumvirate slowly fell into dementia (probably from lack of sleep).  After Arizona finally scored their first touchdown, and received their own excessive celebration penalty, Jim made the comment: "Well, he couldn't have high-fived a fan because there aren't any there."  Ahhh... the insanity of it all!  Finally, what was the deal with the Arizona coach?  Yeah, I know his team was losing and all that, but could he be any less emotional?  I guess I am use to the coach who rants whether the team is winning or losing.  The most emotion this man showed was the "deer stuck in the headlights" look towards the end of the game.  Kudos to the TBS sports desk: "Well, LSU beat Arizona, but next week Arizona will be back ready to defeat Oregon!  Now onto other games...  Yeah, dream on.  It wasn't just because LSU outplayed them; they looked absolutely horrible.  I feel sorry for this team and their die-hard fans this season!  In other news, congrats to Tulane for eeking out a victory over Northwestern in OT.  Buh-bye Top 25 for Auburn... hee hee hee.  I'm taking bets on which school will fire their head coach first: Auburn or Ole Miss?  Any thoughts?  As far as the Saints are concerned, Jim Henderson summarized the game, or should I say train wreak, pretty well yesterday.  Near the end of the fans' misery, Hokie was reading the disclaimer.  You know the one about not rebroadcasting the presentation, which is read near the end of each broadcast.  Well, Jim decided to comment this week: "You don't have to worry about me, I don't plan on ever replaying this one!"  Ho-hum, there is always next week.  At least the Saints don't have to win every game to get into the Super Bowl.  The season is young and hope is still alive... maybe our offense will learn how to play in the mean time.

      So I saw this Saved By the Bell quiz on  urlLink Alison's Blog  and felt it was my duty to let my husband know which character he married... you see, my husband is addicted to Saved By the Bell.  Most mornings, my husband is hard pressed to choose between Fox and Friends and this show.  Of course, guess what DVD set is on his wishlist (Saved By the Bell: Seasons 1 and 2, coming soon!).  I didn't really need to quiz to give me the answer because I already knew it, but here is the confirmation:    Jessica Spano... You like to fight for what you think is right, no doubt about that. Not only does it make you feel important... but it gives you a sense of fitting in. She is a very strong willed which is a quality that some find incredably admirable... but others find incredably irratating.    urlLink   Which Saved By The Bell Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    So there you have it, I'm Jessie... no surprise there.  Ironically, I think it's funny that she has curly hair; I have curly hair....  Speaking of hair, all of mine is gone now.  Yes, I went for the uber-short look with "baby bangs" as my hair stylist called.  Trisha, my most excellent stylist, did a smashing job giving me a short cut that doesn't make me look like a fat dike (hee hee), so if you are looking for a change or just a damn good stylist, visit my pal Trisha Vega-Melacon at Paris Parker Lakeside.  This is an Aveda Lifestyles Store and she is a master stylist (translation: haircuts cost a lot), but it is money well spent.  The real test was this morning, of course.  I was able to wake-up and brush my hair into place... it took like 30 seconds tops to fix it exactly like it looked after leaving the salon!  YEAH!!!  My hair has always been a pain in the ass because it takes at least 30 minutes to fix it on a good... curly hair sucks when you are lazy and like sleeping to the absolute latest.  I am happy for the easy change.  I'll post pics soon for all to view...

      In fifteen minutes, I will be leaving to get my hair chopped again.  This time I am going for the Audrey Hepbrun look from my favorite films Roman Holiday and Sabrina, because I so love the look (and the actress).  Now that I know how to post pictures (and upload images to a web server), I will be sure to post pics.  I also found out that I will have to move my office AGAIN... this time hopefully for good.  I will be relocating to a beautiful cubicle right outside my current office (goodbye private office, goodbye window...) on Monday morning.  This means Friday is another packing day... woohoo!  Today I subjected myself to a lesson in French wine, particularly the  vin de Bordeaux .  The term claret refers to wines produced in a northern region of France called Bordeaux; it was given this name by the British for the wine's distinctive clarity.  Bordeaux's wines vary in variety from red to sweet white.  The varietal depends largely upon the regional location, or vineyard, of the chateau; the Bordeaux region has five vineyards: Medoc, Pomerol, St. Emilion, Graves, and  Sauternes-Barsac.  Primarily, vineyards of Bordeaux produce red and dry white wines.  The Medoc creates only red varietals, while the Sauternes-Barsac produces only sweet white dessert wines.  The chateau(s) of the region also vary in quality; they are given "rankings" based upon their quality and history.  The best wines of the region are known as  premiere cru , or first growth.  These are some of the oldest and most revered chateau(s) on Earth, like Chateau Lafite Rothschild, which is of course reflected in the steep prices.  From here, the chateau(s) are rated accordingly, with the fifth growth being the bottom most of chateau(s).  Great French Bordeaux can be found just as easily, and affordably, in the fifth growth as it can in the first.  For more information about the wines of Bordeaux, visit the  urlLink academie du vin de bordeaux  website.  Drink up!

      Once again, I was reading someone's blog -- this time it was  urlLink Matt's Blog -- and I started thinking on a tangent worthy of another post on the blog.  Matt was talking about LSU and the rent-a-win situation and it made me remember.  It also made me realize just how passionate I am about Tiger Football.  Many of you know that I am a Baton Rouge native, and if you don't know I've been an LSU football fan since I was in my mother's womb.  Most of my childhood memories revolve around tailgating and LSU football games because my father had season tickets and I always remember going, rain or shine, day or night, like a damn postal worker, I swear.  I remember Church's chicken and the parking lot of Kirby Smith.  I remember each time my heart trembled as I heard the LSU Marching Band play pre-game, both inthe stadium and out.  I always made my dad take me to watch the band march into the stadium and at eight, my biggest dream was to be a "Golden Girl."  I was proud to boast that I knew all the words to ALL the LSU songs printed in the programs.  I can still sing both verses of the Alma Mater and the entire tune of "Hey Fighting Tigers."  Those were the things that never changed, that could never go sour... win or lose.  But I also remember when the rent-a-wins were LSU's only wins... you could always count on them: Tulane and someone else.  I remember when I couldn't sell two prime season tickets for their face value if I tried.  LSU's football history has not been so great, and they haven't always been the powerhouse they may be today.  The team has only won a championship once... yes, once ever!  This was in 1948, I believe.  Their only Heisman trophy winner was jailed for money laundering later in life (Go Billy Cannon, DDS!).  Their claim to fame before the infamous Florida game was Billy Cannon making a huge punt return in the snow on Halloween.  The movie Everybody's All American was roughly based on that fable, and was filmed at LSU.  I remember that too.  I distinctly remember the last time LSU was even in championship contention: early 80's, Sugar Bowl vs. Nebraska, LSU's head coach, Bill Arnsbarger, (sp?) had taken an assistant coaching job at Florida or FSU (can't remember which, but pretty sure it was in Florida!) for more money than he was making at LSU (which really sucked).  After that, we had the Archer and Hallman years -- eech!  I remember the goofy Tiger Trax things that played on WFMF with DJ Gymnasium.  Every week, we would make fun of our opponent... each week we would lose horribly.... except to MS State.  Do you know how excited fans were when we made it to the Independence Bowl in '96?  It was a crappy bowl game, arctic weather, but LSU played against and defeated another team after such a long and dry spell.  I ran on the field, hugging people I didn't know in really cold weather because we were so happy we actually had a winning season.  Eddie Kennison was king!  You would have thought we had won a championship after that game.    From there we hit the Peach Bowl... only can go up from there, many thought and then DiNardo sells out and we take a gigantic belly flop into the BCS pool after being ranked in the Top 10 for the first time in decades!  LSU fans can taste BCS championship just like the Saints fans' mouths water for the Super Bowl.  Its like a juicy porterhouse hanging in front of a famished dog... so close and tasty, but so far away.  Saban looks like the guy to do it for LSU: He's getting paid beaucoup to perform, a newly adopted concept of LSU's.  LSU is building consistency, something we've never had before, something that programs like Florida and Nebraska expect.  Yeah, BCS sucks and comparing LSU to the Saints is apples and oranges, but the fans' desire is still the same.  A goal that seems so obtainable at the beginning of each season.  Unfortunately for LSU, it matters if they win every game and it matters if they squash the underling rent-a-wins.  Perhaps at the end of the season, both the Saints and LSU fans can sit back and enjoy a great huge gulp from the cup of victory, which will runneth over the entire blessed state of Louisiana.

      Happy September to everyone out there!  Only four more months until 2004.  Yes, this year has definitely flown by very quickly, and it definitely won't be any slower from here on out: Tioga, Halloween, Trey's Second Birthday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are all ahead.  Here's to smooth sailing through the rest of this year.  This weekend was real nice.  Ted and I spent Saturday in town.  We had hoped to visit the Audubon Nature and Science Center in NO East, but the weather had another idea, so we went to Target and Olive Garden instead.  Not only do they have the never-ending salad and breadsticks, but they've got the never-ending pasta bowls as well now.  Everyone left fat and happy from that dinner table!  Sunday we traveled to Baton Rouge for the scrapbooking shindig at Michelle's.  It was much fun and I look forward to getting more scrapbooking done in the near future.  We stayed over that night, because Paul's belated family birthday party was Monday.  I awoke early and went to get my favorite donuts, Jay's, Monday morning.  Jay's has powdered sugar donut holes, which are the greatest creation ever.  He also makes whole-wheat, sugar free donuts boasting 13.5 grams of carbs and only 150 calories... Yes, they are disgusting so stay far, far away from that option.  For those who want to know, Jay's is on the corner of O'Neal Lane and S. Harrell's Ferry Rd. in Baton Rouge; these tasties are worth a drive from anywhere -- even New Orleans on occasion.  After dining on hot dogs and cake for lunch, Ted and I returned home to clean house and watch Tulane on ESPN.  Of course, LSU won this weekend, but that was to be expected so little to speak of there.  Ted was on a mission to watch SELU's inaugural game Saturday night, but too many complaints of it looking like a high school game (courtesy of me) had him changing the channel.  Yes, there is a reason why Baton Rouge natives call Southeastern "Hammond High;" many of those were realized Saturday night.  SELU did pull out victory number one, so congrats to them.  Major kudos must go out to Tulane for their very LSU-esque rally late in the fourth quarter of their game yesterday evening.  Many lesson still need to be taught, so keep watching Tulane. (Yes, I am kidding.  That was a very good game last night!)  This Saturday, LSU faces Arizona at Arizona, which should be pretty interesting.  Did I read this correctly, TBS will be broadcasting the game, which kicks off at 9 p.m.  Thanks to the Mountain Time Zone for the extra drinking time this week!!  New Orleans own Saints also begin their season this week up north against Seattle.  Ted and I may host a get together for one of the games; that will be announced later.  Until then...

      Yeah!  I am so excited because today is one of the best holidays ever -- HALLOWEEN!  I absolutely love halloween... okay maybe not more than Christmas because of the gifts, but on Halloween it is acceptable to costume.  I love nothing more than dressing up in costume... one of those things carried over from an overactive imagination and playing dress-up when I was a child.  Anywho, this year I am making an appearance as Marilyn Monroe.  Ted will be JFK (can't ever say I don't have a weird sense of humor).  Tonight is the BIG "get drunk and scare little kids" party at "Hotel Minnesota," which I am equally excited about.  It's been far too long sense I've been able to let loose and party.  It sucks being an adult!!  I do have a rant today: e-mail spam.  Risking the corresponding ads that are sure to pop-up on the google bar up there, I'd like to specifically address spam about penis enlargement pills.  You see, last time I checked (which was pretty recently, in fact) I was indeed not a male, nor did I have any of the male corresponding genitalia.  Furthermore my name (Amanda), which is included in the handle of the receiving e-mail address of said junk mail, has a very unlikely possibility of ever being given to a male owning such genitalia.  Given all of these factors, why do I keep getting mail telling me they can make my sex life better by enlarging my penis.  Don't these people have better engines for finding leads?  Sure, I understand how spam software works, but wouldn't time be better spent focusing only on the portion of the population that this e-mail would actually apply to?  Grr... it's just annoying!  One of the first points to making a cold call sale is qualifying your customer.  Qualify guys, qualify!!  Sure, these people are obviously ripping through the law of averages quotient rather quickly, but most of their no's are kind of pointless.  *SIGH*

      For the scrapbookers out there who are interested (Hey, I'm an Equal Opportunity Crafter):  I'm inviting you to join me for some scrapbooking time this Saturday, November 1, 2003, at 3:00 p.m.  Please bring all your pictures, tools and stuff, so we'll have plenty of "toys" to share.  We'll be scrapping until we get tired, so dinner will be provided.  Just drop me a  urlLink line  to let me know you'll be there!  Otherwise, as a reminder for all you De La Salle fans out there, Ted's hosting a tailgating party before the game Saturday.  Yep, you guessed it... it is coinciding with this little scrapbook shindig of mine.  Anyway, the food will be ready for 5 p.m., there will be liquor, then you fans will all walk over to Joe Yenni Stadium for the kickoff at 7 p.m.  If you aren't a DLS fan, you are still welcome to partake in the FREE FOOD if you so desire.  Just let us know if we will be seeing you... Bobby and Ali, I've got you down already.  Men, your girlfriends are invited to stay for scrapbooking if they want.

      I had the pleasure of attending a very FREE launch event for the new and improved Microsoft Office 2003 at the Marriot today.  After today, all I can say is Microsoft is the SHIT!  I came home with so much FREE stuff.. awesome free stuff, like a completely free version of Microsoft Office 2003 Professional, which retails for $499.  Yep, I got a $500 piece of software just for attending this elaborate, day-long sales pitch.  On top of that, I also received a free eval. copy of the enterprise edition, which includes all the new servers and other technical toys.  They provided breakfast, lunch and snacks throughout the day.  To top it off, I even got a free t-shirt.  Some lucky sons-of-bitches won fabulous raffle prizes: like a Tablet-PC, a 20" Flat panel monitor, a digital camera, or a traveling DVD entertainment system!  It was definitely way more than I was expecting.  Yep, Microsoft kicks ass!  I'll definitely be looking for more events like this one in the future!!

      I read an article today on MSN.  The job market is recovering, but with one very bad symptom... jobs are paying less.  The example they use is industrial jobs that paid 35K are beng replaced with retail jobs paying 19K.  That is horrifying!  Another bad turn, employees are seeing more fees that their employers formerly paid for.  Examples lie in rising healthcare costs (employers are subsidizing less) and lower matching contributions to company retirement plans.  As someone who is looking for a place to plant roots, I find this outlook bleak to say the least.  I remember when I started college: get a degree and the work force is yours.  People will be begging you to take their 50K a year jobs.  Yeah, okay.  These days it's: get a graduate degree and maybe we can find a 50K a year job for you somewhere.  I find this depressing after all the years of hard work I've put into finishing my undergraduate degree.  I want to go back and start over... maybe major in something useful!  Right now, I am over qualified for secretarial work and under-qualified for most anything that pays well.  Right now, I am comfortable making my $20/hour.  Yes, I wish I had health benefits to go along with that nice wage, but one apparently can't have everything.  Well, my current job contract will end on December 31, 2003.  Sionara nice paycheck.  I've decided to get a head start on the job search, so I have time to find something with equivalency to what I'm doing now.  Today, I've sent my resume off for two potential positions here in New Orleans.  Hopefully, I will hear something in regards to my requests.  Even more wishful: I hope these positions can provide equivalent pay.  I am desperately looking for a position with health benefits, so we shall see what we get with this.  One of the jobs is in New Orleans East, a dreadful drive, but it provides healthcare, so....  I am determined to hold out for something great; but as it gets closer and closer to my end date, I am more willing to take anything even though I hate the thought.  Oh, by the way, I am voting for Bobby Jindal in the runoff election.  Blanco has disappointed me and proven to be a stuck-up, dumb bitch.  I hope that Jindal can clean house much like Nagin did after taking the mayor's office here in New Orleans.

      Seems that LSU plucked a few feathers from the old War Eagle last night.  I'm highly delighted in their victory.  Next week, homecoming and Louisiana Tech.  I doubt this game is being televised; which is probably a good thing because I won't be here to watch it as I will be bowing to the local prep sports game for the evening.  I really think I should make Ted attend a Weedlawn game before the end of the season...  Halloween costumes have been planned and purchased and I am ready for Friday to get here already!  In the mean time, I will be hobnobbing with Bill Gates on Tuesday for some Launch Event thing I was invited to attend downtown.  Other than that, it's just work, work, work.

       "Rerun" from the T.V. show, "What's Happening" died yesterday.  That's pretty sad because I remember watching that show all the time when I was little.  If you don't remember, he was the big guy with the red hat and suspenders that always said, "Hey, hey, hey."  His character reminded me of Fat Albert.  I am sure there will be other celebrity deaths soon because they always happen in threes.  Pam Anderson says she'll be dead in ten years from Hepititus C...okay, guess that doesn't count.  Trying to decide what Ted and I will be for Halloween.  We are debating between Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio (or JFK) OR Sandra Dee and Danny Zucco from Grease because we have most of the stuff for those costumes already.  Trey's going to be Eeyore again, if the costume fits.  Otherwise, he will most likely be Harry Potter.  We are going to Baton Rouge for some trick-or-treating in the lovely Azalea Lakes subdivision.  Trey's going to stay the night at his grandmother's house while we return to New Orleans for some serious partying!  It feels good not having class on Halloween this year.  This weekend, I'm going to get a head start on baking cookies for Trey's Halloween party at daycare.  Cutting out all those cookies takes forever.... and the icing, ugh!  I'd rather not be rushed this year.  Not too much else going on.

      The weekend is over and I think I've recovered somewhat.  Tioga 2003 was a huge success.  I think everyone there had a great time.  Sure, there were the few who were disappointed (or offended); and this year's attendees were among the dirtiest I've ever seen, but there was definitely plenty of spirit floating around the entire weekend.  No falling trees or major natural disasters to report.  A very big shout out to Bobby and gang for organizing a great time for the K'ers.  Now for the list of things I learned or experienced this weekend:    1.  You are officially old when you can remember how to get to the Kiwanis Camp in Tioga without any directions.   2.  No matter how much you plan, people will always eat the opposite of last year's trend.   3.  Old people dance, just while sitting down.   4.  College kids have been fully assimilated into the world of buffets, where you must get a new plate for each food trip.   5.  The ER at Ochsner Foundation Hospital is pretty damn slow and they aren't trained to handle peds patients.   6.  The bank card with the major credit card logo doesn't count at Enterprise... at least not for SUVs.   7.  Just because you put a trash can in front of someone's face doesn't mean they will use it....ever.   8.  DO NOT stop to use the "Recreational Area" between Lafayette and Alexandria if you are a woman.   9.  All feet and hands inside the vehicle before closing the door.   10.  One should always remember her cell phone charger on trips like these.   11.  Yes, hospital pharmacies can lose medication.   12.  Being a graduate student does not guarantee that you know anything about subject-verb agreement.   13.  "Hyroglyphics and Hebrew are the same thing because they both begin with an H"   14.  Anything can be misinterpretted as a "line."   15.  I-10 at I-49 construction is just a lie told by the speed trappers on Hwy 190.    16. Even a white boy (Paul) can be a Xavier guy's DAWG. 17. Some people actually believe they can get a hotel room at $35 for the weekend.    As you can see, my weekend was filled with entertainment.  My bad week continued into Friday, of course.  At 3 a.m., a sleepy Ted and I took Trey to the ER because he was pretty ill.  We didn't get home until 6:30... eeck!  So yeah, I made the drive to Tioga with absolutely ZERO sleep... and still stayed awake until midnight!  I am still very tired from my weekend. So tired, in fact, that I had to skip work on Monday so I could sleep.  Hopefully I'll be fully recovered soon!

      Tomorrow is the big day, the beginning of another year at the Tioga Kiwanis Campground for the LMT Circle K Fall Training Conference.  I will be once again reprising my role as "Kitchen Witch," with lots of help from quite a few recent alumni.  This year, I might actually get to take a look at the lake while it's still light outside!  Sunday, it's another scrapbooking day at Michelle's house.  Looking forward to that too.  If I have some time, I might even work on my scrapbook while at Tioga!  hope everyone has a great weekend.  For all those going to Tioga, see you there!!

      This has definitely been one of those weeks.  You know, the ones where you just wish you could pack your bat up, go home, and hide until a new week begins.  Monday it was the holy terror work computer, which has decided that it definitely hates Microsoft Office XP... particularly any and all word documents I happen to be working on.  Oh yeah, and my mouse just randomly ceased to work.  Definitely a Monday for me.  Tuesday was the number one best excuse to call into work with: I found a child in my front yard and it isn't mine.  Paul has assured me that he plans to try that sometime.  My own child was delivered to daycare covered in banana because Mommy was so shaken up that she forgot to clean the child before jumping in the car!  During the day, my computer continued to act like a tempermental two-year-old.  Have I mentioned that no one likes returning my calls here at work, which makes my job much harder than necessary.  Today: the infamous flat tire.  Yes, what better way to make you late once again, then to get a flat tire.  But, it gets better: went to Chevron, home of the free air, and had to wait for TEN MINUTES as some old guy filled up every single tire on his truck.  Then some ASSHOLE pulls up and steals the freakin' air from me!  By the time I got the air, not only was it 7:50, but the air didn't even work right!  Yeah, a wasted trip and a wasted wait.  I somehow managed to get enough air into the tire to be on my way.  I was FIFTEEN minutes late for work; even later than should have been because my son had decided to glue himself to my side and refuse to be left at daycare (which he normally doesn' t have a problem with).  Yes, I have decided it is time to start the week over.  Oh wait, Stephen Hawking hasn't figured the whole time travel thing out yet.  Can I at least go home and sleep off the rest of the week?  Nope, Tioga begins Friday!  Grrr... I need to relax and take some calming breaths.  I hope I can salvage the remainder of the week.  I'm looking forward to some opportunities to sneak away for some quality "nature and me" time this weekend.  It will be good.

      The craziest shit always happens to me!  I have no clue why, but it just seems to happen.  This morning, Ted calls me from his cell, not even thirty seconds after he's walked out the door for work.  "There's this kid roaming around out here with no shirt on.  I think he slept in my car!"  Yeah, "Holy Shit!" was what I was thinking too.  I ran out of the house to find the half-dressed, small child walking around in the parking lot in front of my house.  I got him to come inside with me, with the promise of food and clothing.  He played with Trey's toys and watched Barney while I made him some toast and called 911.  I called work, because I just might be a tad late thing morning, told what is really an unbelievable story.  This kind of stuff always happens to me!  Friday before the elections, I posted this pretty bitchy blog in reference to a story I read in the T-P about an eight-year-old boy who was literally abandoned by his father.  The story really pissed me off because not only did his neighbors do NOTHING to help this child, but the little boy roamed the neighborhood he was abandoned in for TWO DAYS (wailing most of the time) before someone took him in!  This really, REALLY pissed me off.  That people have become so numb to society that they could let a lost child roam around instead of taking him in and comforting him really disgusts me.  I'll repeat what I said then: This is why we K-Family people are here.  Someone has to be vigilant and protective of our needy.  Turns out the child had simply walked out of his house this morning, while his parents and grandparents weren't looking.  He had his mother's key in his pocket.  The J-P responded VERY QUICKLY; they definitely have their shit together and I applaud them for their outstanding response.  The child lives in a household with five other kids, his mother, maybe a father, and his young grandparents (I imagine his mother is VERY young).  I've been asked to keep an eye out for the child.  If I see him roaming around again, I must report it just as I have today, so they can investigate further.  I am glad I responded quickly and with the best interest of the child today.  I know that if I were in the same situation, I would want someone to take Trey in and take care of him until he could be found, but I'm going to by doorknob protectors, just in case.

      I hate the Weather Channel; I'm tired of thinking they are reputable only to be proven wrong.  I know, I know.  After they called the panhandle of Florida the panhandle of Texas, I'd pretty much said I would swear them off as stupid idiots, but it is just SO easy to tune in channel 18 on the 8's for the local weather.  These days however, I'm  questioning the ability of the Weather Channel to actually predict the weather.  I mean this weekend, the high was suppose to be in the balmy high eighties... pretty hot for the seventies we've been in.  In fact, I got yelled at by Ted for suggesting he wear pants to work on Saturday because it was going to be in the "high eighties."  Yeah... if you went outside around the NOLA area, it sure didn't feel like anywhere near 80, much less HIGH 80's.  I haven't quite given up hope yet...everyone else said the same thing for the past weekend.  Tioga FTC begins in four days.  I always hate packing for Tioga because the weather is always weird.  Sometimes it's hot; sometimes it's cold.  Sometimes it is both!  I always end up bringing more clothes then I should because I never know what the weather will be like.  Looking at the weather often doesn't help, but here's the TWC predictions for Tioga this weekend: Friday -- 77/54; Saturday -- 76/55; Sunday -- 78/54.  Wednesday, it suppose to get as low as 48!  So, again this year, I suggest packing both warm and cool weather stuff.  I hate bringing so many things!  UGH!

      Ted treated me to an excellent evening out.  He picked me up "date style" at 7:30, then we headed to Andrea's for a wonderful Italian meal.  I definitely suggest this fine dining experience for all those who can spare the extra cash.  The food was delicious; service was excellent.  Even Chef Andrea made an appearance, asking us personally if we enjoyed our dining experience!  Ted and I have decided that we will definitely be paying a return visit to this favorite.  Because  we couldn't think of anything to do (and we didn't want to fight the teenagers at the theatre), we rented "Down With Love" from DVD Express (they are the shit!).  I liked this movie.  I LOVE all the Doris Day/Rock Hudson features, mainly the film "Pillow Talk."  I couldnt' quite decide if they were mocking or paying tribute to those films, but it was a great viewing just the same.  LSU's playing was depressing this weekend, that's all I can say about that.  I hope they can save some aggression for Auburn in two weeks.

      I hate our insurance company.  There really are a bunch of jackasses working there.  If you remember from an earlier post, I have no health insurance because I overestimated my weight on my app. and was deemed "too fat" to be insured.  Well, I had to go to the doctor's office Tuesday.  I paid $215 for the visit, with the assurance that I had drug coverage, if nothing else.  After all, the insurance company DID send me a card with a drug company on it and a Rx member ID.  Logic would say that this would indicate that I indeed have coverage.  So would the fact that I signed on to their website and verified everything beforehand.  HA!  $244 later, I can say that I am pretty pissed at this insurance company.  I go to Target, the pharmacist goes to fill my prescription and it keeps kicking it out because it says my birthday is incorrect.  Okay... no biggie, I think.  So he calls the company to get it straight and they've never heard of me!  Pharmacist says, "but she has a card with her name on it!"  Yeah, but we've never heard of her.... jackasses!  Screw them!  We are shopping around and they can just kiss it!  *DEEP CALMING BREATH*

      I have two things to get off my head this evening.  First, as everyone has heard by now, Fr. Knoth, president of my alumni Loyola University New Orleans, has resigned amid sexual allegations.  Sure, this comes as a shock because while I've thought the man was crooked and certainly high-handed at times, I never would have expected this behavior of him.  He is a fine leader who has brought to fruition much growth and opportunity to the university.  Knoth's beginnings as president of the university coincided with my own matriculation, so I've truly been able to see the improvements he had brought to the campus.  Does this mean he cannot be a sexual predator?  Absolutely not.  If he is proven not guilty, then I am very sorry that this has happened to him; however, if my son were the accuser, I would want full justice raught no matter how long ago it was.  Unfortunately, I am pretty sure Knoth's days were numbered as president of the university anyway.  Yes, he has improved the institution; however his narcissitic methods were beginning to wear thin with faculty and the Archdiocese.  He has had problems with the archibishop recently and the dissension of the faculty was getting harder for the administration to hide from the students.  The interim president, Fr. Byron, has an impressive resume of experience.  I think he will be a welcome change.  Knoth leaves the university with a new marketing plan and capital project prospectus in hand.  I think Loyola will be just fine.  Moving on, do you know how much garbagemen in Chicago make?  Unionized Teamster garbagemen make $10 - $21 per hour!  I have a college degree, and there are uneducated garbagemen who make more than I do!  That is so depressing...  Well, Tioga is next week, so the next few days will be filled with planning stuff.  Until next time...

      So, elections are tomorrow; and like everyone else, I must post my choices for office.  It's by region, yada yada...  Governor: Blanco because I like her better and her platform reads well on the web and at cabl.org. LTG: Kirt Bennet, I just can't vote for Landrieu. Sec. of State: I guess Fox, but I don't like it.  I know his family... we went to school together. Attorney Gen: Terrell, but I will promptly puke afterwards. Ag: Bob Odom because the other guy goes by the name Don Johnson, how gay is that? Insurance: Dan Kyle... although voting for someone who goes by the name "T-T" is tempting... :-) BESE, 1st District: Donna Contois because she's a teacher. State Senator, 9th District: Ken Hollis because Ted told me too... something about the Aints. State Rep, 80th: Sclafani... any relation to the restaurant??  I know nothing about this race. Sheriff: Harry Lee, I guess.  Yet again, "The Big O" would be a wonderful name for a sheriff. Parish Pres: John McDonald, because the daycare told me too. Councilman at Large, Division A: John Young.  You know, he was a UNO Circle K'er.. hee hee. Councilman at Large, Division B: Patricia LeBlanc... We're probably related... LeBlancs are all over. Councilman, District 5: Uhhh.... Jennifer Sneed?  I have no clue. Constitutional Amendments: Yea to all except: 15.  Still debating 5,  because I think it could cause "imbreeding" in Worker's Comp. Jeff. Parish Teacher's Pay: YEA.  In EBR, I attended 3 years in a  school that should have been demolished.  Each year, they tried to pass a tax referendum and each time it failed until my senior year.  Sure, there may be misuse of money in the school board now.  But by the time that is straightened out, all the good teachers will be gone.  Teachers deserve to not suffer.  Teachers deserve their pay now!  Did anyone read the paper this morning?  On the front page was a story about an eight year-old boy who was abandoned by his father.  Yeah, drove to a neighborhood away from his home and kicked his son out the car door; the child was screaming "I love you Daddy. I don't want to go!"  The eight year-old roamed the neighborhood for TWO DAYS, crying for his father.  Did no one notice?!?!?  He finally knocked on someone's door and they let him in and called the police.  The story made me sick!  How could anyone treat an innocent child like that?    The story describes how his father and his father's girlfriend sold prescription drugs and ran a prostitution ring out of their Kenner home.  The eight year-old had never been to school, couldn't read or write.  He was always sent outside so his father could "conduct his business."  The boy was taken to Children's in September because his legs were swollen from so many misquito bites!!  When he was found after being abandoned, he was covered in bites.  And what does his father do?  Sells the drugs his son was sent home with.  How come no one caught this sooner?  The neighbor across the street who was quoted: "No way I could have missed that!"  What is even worse: some well-off Metairie couple BOUGHT the Kenner home for this obviously mental patient and his pregnant WIFE (who is no longer around)!  Doesn't anyone have eyes!!  When I read things like this, I can't help but wonder what the hell this world has come to.  I also can't help but imagine my child suffering as much.  Ultimately, I realize exactly why all my friends do the volunteerism that they do... all you K-Family members out there: We are very, VERY needed in this community and in this world.  If you need to be reminded of this from time to time, to better commit yourself to service, this story is an ultimate reminder!

      Read this in an e-mail from People.com this morning:   BITTEN:  Police in Brownwood, Texas, say a man was bitten by a rattlesnake while shopping for shoes in the local Wal-Mart, reports AP. Douglas Hatchett, 31, was examining shoes on a rack when the slithering reptile (which was concealed behind a shoebox) bit him. The snake reportedly fell to the floor, where Hatchett stomped it to death. Emergency medical crews were summoned to the scene, and the shopper and the dead snake were hustled to a hospital, where the snake was confirmed as a rattler, and Hatchett was treated and released. Wal-Mart officials say the matter is being investigated.    DAMN!  Gotta watch out for those Wally-world Rattlers!

      Not me, apparently. :-)   Romantic movie! You probably won't star in a porno anytime soon. You seem to be really into the whole "love" thing...romantic sex with perfumed sheets and candles all over the place. You're probably a hopeless romantic. You value sex and respect your partner too much to do anything like porn. AWWWWWW!     urlLink   What kind of porno would you star in?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Continuing with my Turkey Week theme, I'd like to talk about "Random Turkey."  This morning, I woke up knowing today would be a completely random day.  Ted's car (i.e.- my CR-V) was broken into yesterday, so I knew I had to deal with that today.  We went to the State Farm claims office first thing this morning.  They don't do estimates at the office anymore, go figure.  So, off to work I went.  Life is so often completely random.  I checked my personal e-mail this morning and found another of those "penis enlargement" e-mails.  The funny thing was in the address field.  What are the chances that you actually know another person receiving the same piece of spam?  Yep, one Sean McDonald actually received the same mail that I did this morning... Hi Sean!  THAT is very random.  So now, I am just waiting for what's next.  I guess it is like waiting for the other shoe to fall.

      Welcome to Turkey Week!  Yep, I've decided that Thanksgiving Day is just getting overlooked this year.  Everything around is Christmas, Christmas, Christmas!  So, in my infinite wisdom, I've decided to proclaim this week as Turkey Week! (Can't you hear the trumpets blaring??)  Alright, so Thanksgiving is a little hard to stretch over a week, but geez must we stretch Christmas across four months!!  Ted is happy; Thanksgiving means he can now bombard the house with 24/7 Christmas caroling and Christmas carol parodies!  The Sounds of the Season channel has been "Christmased out" for weeks now; I'm losing sleep because Ted insists on falling asleep to it every night.  Geez, I'm sounding like a Grinch.  I love Christmas time, Christmasy weather, Christmas cooking, etc., but it's just pissing me off how commercial the feast day has become!  Hallmark rolls out their ornaments beginning in July; Wal-mart has had yard decorations and Christmas paraphernalia out since August.  Summer is hardly over by then; autumn has not arrived.  It most certainly is not winter yet either!  Why aren't there any Thanksgiving songs or cute Pilgrim and Indian lighted decorations?  Nevermind, don't answer that.  I think I've vented my commercial, hippie-esque schlep long enough for the day.   As I posted last week, I finished the DaVinci Code on Friday and it was a fascinating book!  The author weaves truth with fiction so amazingly that it is hard to put the book down once you start reading it.  Was it harmful to my faith?  Absolutely not!  I find that it enriched it, renewed the spirit of it in some ways.  The best way I can explain it is this:  We are moving from 2000 years of humans needing leadership to find their faith to a new millennium where humans can finally have the ability to seek faith on their own.  Does this negate church?  I don't think so; however it scares priest driven religions, like the Roman Catholics.  The Vatican, I think, realizes it proved something with the stories of the priest scandals: religion, the Church, the Bible, priests, and nuns are all human and therefore fallible according to their own doctrine.  It's a great awakening, a Renaissance if you will, for today's society.  The religion we have believed in may not be completely right, but that's okay because it is human and fallible.  It is okay that we are human and fallible too.  We do not need to be perfect to be admitted into "heaven."  Maybe, we are already halfway there?  I think the Vatican should capture that feeling instead of trying to fight their broken image.  There is no way they can ever be seen as "perfect" again.  According to Archbishop Hughes, the Catholic Church is now trying to rebuild the spirit and sanctity of mass with the Roman Missal thing I posted.  The church realizes that going to hear a priest's homily is no longer enough anymore because many priests can no longer achieve the same level of trust and respect as they did before the sex scandals.  Distrust clouds the minds of the faithful; blocking the message.  But is saying the Lord's Prayer in Latin going to do the job?  What about Gregorian chant?  Silence and reverence?  Ted will disagree with me, but I think the idea sounds beautiful.  I'd really enjoy listening to the language because I believe the language itself is beautiful.  I may not know what the words mean, but I feel a "passion" in hearing it that I don't get from everyday English.  Maybe, this is about capturing that feeling, of understanding that the words themselves are not important; maybe we instinctively understand even though our brain can't compute.  Perhaps it could make what we say or hear in mass special, like Greek for the Greek Orthodox; however I have a feeling it will alienate a few who cannot not understand.  Maybe I'm just being far too existential.

      This won't be too long because my head feels like it is going to explode at any second.  Sinus pressure=inflamation around that nerve around your tmj joint (Lauren, help??)=migraine AND sinus headache all at one time!!!  Anyway, started reading The DaVinci Code last night.  I've read the first four chapters... could have read more but the whole head exploding thing started last night and using my eyes or any of the frontal lobes of my brain hurt too much.  It's a very well written book.  I 've really liked how the author intermingles fact with fiction; it's also pretty fast paced.  I'll explain more as I get into it.  Can't wait for a discussion with Ali and Becca!  I'd again like to thank Jeff. Parish for returning at 2:22 a.m. this morning to remove and replace the reflectors on the road.  That's always an important endeavor.  What I am really interested in hearing is the opinion of my Catholic friends out there on this new "General Instruction on the Roman Missal" which was recently announced in the U.S.  I'm reserving my opinion on this for later because I haven't read it fully.  From what I've gleaned thus far, it will return or alter many things common in traditional mass today.  I'm interested in hearing whether you think it will hurt or help the Roman Catholic religion.  You can read the document  urlLink here .  You have to have Adobe Acrobat Reader because it is a pdf file.  Also, look at an article fromt he Clarion Herald discussing the changes with Archbishop Hughes  urlLink here .   Please comment away!

      So on Monday, I took the staight pin, found in my mouth while masticating food, to the culprits for "investigations."  Today at 3-ish, I finally heard back from the rather rude bakery.  They are giving me a full refund on my purchase!  Thank you!  So, I feel pretty much vindicated now for the little mishap.  I don't plan on using the bakery again, as I've said before,  but at least after three days the idiots in charge finally felt the need to handle their business.  The infamous interview, which was moved from Friday to Monday, went swimingly and would appear to be a good professional move for me.  We will wait to see what happens on Cingular's part and DM's as well.  Kirschman's also offered me an interview for a Copywriter position, which I turned down after hearing several horror employment tales from people around the office.  At this stage, I can afford to be a little choosy with my interviewing.  I'll worry more next month.

      I'd really like to thank the fine folks of Jefferson Parish's "Street Division" who thought it would be a most excellent idea to power wash Clearview Pkwy, between West Napoleon and West Metairie, at around 11 p.m. last night.  I'm just really comforted in knowing that my tax dollars are going towards such great efforts to keep the concrete road surfaces of this parish looking so bright, clean, and sparkling fresh.  I mean, some might be thwarted by the fact that millions of dirty, rubber tires roll across the surfaces of this thruway, but not Jefferson Parish!  We, as citizens of said wonderful parish, should be absolutely thrilled to be awakened by the cacaphony of the extra-large traveling generator and high-powered washing wand as the one lone "power washer man" walked each of the six lanes of Clearview, taking such infinite care as to spend five minutes cleaning out a crevice in front of 1125 Clearview Pkwy.  Such dedication should be awarded, no applauded.  The care our great parish takes in making our roadways clean should "awaken in our hearts a tender glow."  So again, I'd like to give a big F-U... I mean THANK YOU to Jefferson Parish!

      I hate saying this, but avoid Gambino's Bakery.  Last night, I was eating a piece of Trey's birthday cake.  I was about to swallow when I discovered something of unusual consistency in my mouth.  I pulled it out... low and behold, it was a pin!  Yep, a P-I-N of the metal, straight variety, with a small flat head.  Now you may be asking yourself, "How the hell did a pin get in a cake?"  I too have been thinking the same thing, not to mention Matt and Ted as well.  Even more, what if Trey had eaten that bite of cake?  I am just really angry about this.  So, I called Gambino's this morning.  No problem I think, they'll just tell me to come in and get a refund.  Yeah, right.  First, it took me over one hour to even talk to someone about what I believe is a MAJOR problem.  Then, I am told to bring in the pin so they can find out where it came from because we don't have pins here.  Interpretated: "You are lying and trying to get a free cake out of us."  Fine, I'll bring in the damn pin, you dumbasses!  I'll also call the Dept. of Public Health on your asses as well.  Man, I am now enraged about this whole incident.  I paid almost $50 dollars... yep, FIFTY DOLLARS for what I trusted would be a quality and delicious cake for my son's second birthday.  What did I get?  A straight pin in my chocolate cake! GRRRRRRR.....  I've been a faithful customer of Gambino's for a very long time.  Sucks to be them... they have lost my business!  I'm going to Haydel's and making sure everyone I know avoids them as well... IDIOTS!

Please wish me luck, so that I may find a great job before December 31, 2003.  *BREAKING NEWS*   I just found out that my contract just might be renewed for another three months. YEAH!!  There is one final approval to get, which could take as long as three weeks.  Please pray that I get this and can remain where I happily am at for now!  Still wish me luck tomorrow, but I hope to keep my current position because I love what I'm doing!

      I watched Fear Factor last night for the first time ever because an acquaintance from work was on the show.  Pretty cool, I actually know someone who was one a reality show.... make that last night's Fear Factor champion.  That is SO awesome!  Out of a bull rider (from Monroe, LA no less), a personal trainer, a snow boarder, and other equally daring professions, an accountant (auditor actually) from New Orleans won Fear Factor yesterday.  I find that fact pretty funny.  I haven't gotten a chance to ask him what it was like picking up hissing roaches in his mouth... don't know if I really want to, but I'm definitely in awe of his willingness to do just about anything for $50K!

I've got to come in briefly tomorrow to test the PLATEAU system (IS is installing a patch tonight).  Tomorrow night is the UNO dance.  All you ladies watch out because my cute little toddler terror will be there!  Sunday looks to be a free day... thank you!  No LSU game to cheer or Saints game for Ted to yell about; yep, this should be a pretty relaxing weekend.  Be sure to check out my  urlLink hubby's smurfy blog .

      Yep, I apologize for being stupid when it comes to Biblical figures.  Quite honestly, all the people named John, Joseph, and Mary are pretty confusing.  I'm guessing this is why we have kids named Cadillac, Lemonjello and Bumquisha these days... can't really get them confused.  Can you imagine if the Bible included names like that?  It's probably better if my imagination doesn't go there today; I'm still getting over George Carlin/Denis Leary as Jesus.  Yeah, I went to several, several years of after school Catechism, which was obviously ineffectual because I can't even remember the names of the apostles... then again, I wouldn't remember my head if it wasn't attached already, so I guess I can be forgiven.  But just ask me anything about Revelations... I'm virtually a scholar on Revelations (read: I was told the world was going to end in fourth grade and was scared crapless so I kept reading that book over and over again.  Heavy stuff for a nine year old).  I guess attending a Catholic university could count, but all my local friends, and my husband, would tell me differently.  Really, it is a Catholic university and it isn't THAT liberal....  Yeah, shut up you! :-)  Geez, I even worked at a Baptist church for over a year!  You'd think I would have learned something other than Augustine.    I'm ready to move on to something lighter.  All this heavy thinking is making my headache.  :-)  Did you know that students and medical doctors are the most likely people to get in car accidents?  Students average 152 accidents a year, while doctors average 109.  Guess this doesn't bode well for our resident med student Lauren... drive carefully, please!  A farmer gets in the least amount of accidents, which is surprising given the way they tend to drive their tractors on the road.  They only get in 43 accidents per year.  FYI, the national average accident rate for most occupations was 89.  This was based on 40 occupations, per 1,000 drivers.   urlLink MSN  also lists speeding tickets and moving violations as well.  Can't say anything bodes well for the student; they have the most of everything.  I guess the moral of this story would be to never tell the insurance company that you are a student!

      Look, I'm no art historian or critic.  I've really bad vision which is corrected thanks to the technology of silicon-based contact lenses and years of scientific research, so I can't say my vision is all that great.  That  being said, Paul's comment about the feminine looking human beside Jesus in "The Last Supper" just intrigued me enough to go and look at it.  As I've said before, and will say again, I am a dork.  Anyway, it's true!  The person looks very feminine, but according to the labeling on this picture, it's John the Baptist.  Take a look:          da Vinci also painted a portrait of John the Baptist later in his life.  I swear, John the Baptist makes a prettier chick than Mona Lisa!          In one of the Gnostic gospels, the Gospel of Saint Thomas, saying #114 "Simon Peter says to them: 'Let Mary go out from our midst, for women are not worthy of life!' Jesus says: 'See, I will draw her so as to make her male so that she also may become a living spirit like you males. For every woman who has become male will enter the Kingdom of heaven.'  The Mary they speak of is Mary Magdelene, who also has her own Gnostic gospel as well.  She too talks of becoming a man.  It is also Mary who sees the risen Christ and John's gospel which describes in the most detail the event.  Now, wouldn't that be funny if Mary and John were one in the same??  Now, don't go all crazy on me because I'm definitely not saying this is true because I'm certainly no theologist either.  I just thought it was interesting, what about you?

      I was reading on   Jess' blog  about this book and it just made me want to comment.  I really want to read this book!  I've read lots of newspaper articles and reviews on it, and I find it very interesting... like the movie Stigmata interesting.    I've always found the way the bible portrays women as unsatisfactory.  Obviously, the entire book was an aural tradition that was transcribed by MEN of the cloth, so certain opinions were definitely intertwined into its authorship.  Because Eve, the first woman, succumbs to the temptation of the Forbidden Fruit, the authors of the Bible seem compelled to portray all women as "the great sinners" in life.  After that, women are the liars, betrayers or just plain "not there" characters in many of the stories in the Bible.    Then along comes Jesus, who must be at least part human in order to play his role as our savior, right?  To be human means, he must be birthed; Only women can birth children.  So, the scribes have the great challenge of making the mother, Mary, stand out as deserving of carrying the savior.  Answer: Let's make her a virgin!  Was this true?  I don't really think so.  Sure, she was a virgin at the time of Jesus' conception.  I don't doubt that.  But this woman did not live the remainder of her life as a virgin!  To believe this really is ludicrous in my opinion; however this was the scribes only way of showing her as "pure" enough to mother to son of God.    Moving on,  Mary Magdalen is portrayed as a prostitute throughout her life in the Bible.  She was also one of Jesus' more devout followers and seemed to always be around to care for the savior.  To believe that in reality, Mary Magdalen was Jesus' wife, instead of a whore, seems very logical to me.  Of course, the scribes of the time could not portray Jesus as that human, nor could they portray any other woman as holy as the "virgin" Mary, mother of God.  Hence, we have a prostitute not a wife of Jesus.  Of course, like that missing book of the Bible that contains the writings of Jesus, churches (okay, mainly those of the Catholic variety) are worried that this will disrupt, even destroy, everything they've built their faith upon.  I honestly don't think this is true.  First, I honestly find the revelation that all those "priests doing the altar boys" jokes were actually based in reality to be far more detrimental to the church than Jesus having a wife or Mary having sex after she is married!  Come on, as its written, Jesus seems to be a homo!  Don't want that, now do we?  That the essence of the Holy Trinity is within and throughout everything we see and experience, not just within the walls of a church building, seems to be the foundation of true faith to me; not a wrecking ball to a religious regime.  Yes, we need church to promote fellowship... to share our faith, but it isn't the only place we experience faith or religion.  Okay, that's my inspired blather of the day.  What do you think?  Would finding out that Mary Magdalen was Jesus' wife shake your religious world up?  Do you think this is all a load of crap?  Am I just a liberal blasphemor?

      So, this past weekend was a blast.  The Hotel Minnesota party was great!   Yeah, I drank WAY TOO much, and had to bow to the goddess of porcelain, but a fun time I still had.  You definitely know you've drank alot when you wake up in the morning and you are still drunk!  That night, I had my first (and last) Flaming Dr. Pepper... mixing beer and liquor at any time is never suggested, don't care what the rhyme says.  Other than my little embarassment, I had a great time partying and forgetting that I have to be an adult (and parent) for the other 364 days of the year.  Met some interesting people with equally interesting names... I think I'll leave it at that.  Thanks to the residents of Hotel Minnesota for hosting such a wonderful bash!  Saturday, Bobby, Ali and Matt came over for the BBQ.  Ted, Bobby, and Ali had the misfortune of attending a really awful football game, from what I hear.  Matt and I just chilled at the house.  We listened to LSU squash the ever living bejesus out of La. Tech.  Wow!  What a victory.  I am happy to say that LSU is back in the hunt at Number 4!.  As long as the Tigers don't choke again, and someone from numbers 1-3 gets their ass beaten again, LSU could have a shot at the BCS championship this year.  Yes, completely amazed I am, as I am sure other fans are as well.  GEAUX TIGERS!!  The UNO Circle K Dance is this weekend at Wally Pontiff (i.e. Metairie) Playground.  I'm wondering if the infamous "Solid Gold" Wall Dancers will make an appearance.  Guess we shall see.  Trey will be attending this time; he really likes to dance.  Ted will be DJing, so I get to quote that stupid song all night long.  "I'm with the DJ"  You can just imagine the head snaps... think cheerleader on crack... Hee hee hee!  I think I will try to get him to throw in some old school stuff... gotta have the "cars that go boom!"  YEAH!  Anyway, some of you old timers need to come and keep me company.  I'm scared of some of these new people, you know! :-)

      I'm not a fortunate person.  I won't be attending Sunday's championship game featuring my hometown Tigers against OU.  Nope, I'll be watching the game from the couch in my apartment, with several of my equally unfortunate friends beside me.  Hopefully, we will be cheering LSU onto victory in the 'dome.  But my laptop, now there is an interesting and fortunate story.  The Nokia Sugar Bowl peeps, whomever they may be, are clients of @ Your Service IT Solutions, the company comprised of Rob Bower, David Harvey, and my husband respectively.  A part of the major deal between the boys of @ Your Service and the fellas of Nokia is the rental of my very own personal laptop, a 2G Gateway that I've had for a little over a year.  One of a kind among the other Dells that Ted's company rented, it seems that my laptop has been chosen to serve as the technology base for one Executive Director, Paul Hoolahan.  How cool is that?  So, while I definitely won't be among the many fans in the Superdome on Sunday, my laptop will be there, so at least I have some claim to attending a National Championship Game.  Woohoo!

      So, the wonderous days of vacationing and holidaying are over, for now.  I racked up on some great gifts (a foot spa, some fancy kitchen towels, a belgian waffle iron, and a pizza stone to name a few), some not-so-great gifts (a cordless "Gizmo" can opener which has to be attached under a cabinet and some mysterious stone-type earrings), and some great times spelunking for gifts in my mom's jewelry box (always fun!).  The "Gizmo" was returned yesterday for a striking value of $25, give or take a few pennies.  This bought us a few groceries at our friendly Wal-Mart, super variety.  The holiday traveling went off almost without a hitch.  Christmas Eve went a little later that anticipated because of a round of "Naughty Santa" for the adults.  Ted had to go to his parents to pick up Trey's desk, so he didn't get to bed until almost midnight.  We were definitely dragging a little Christmas morning (we woke up for 5:30), but with all the present opening at our house, we still managed to get to mass on time!  We probably won't be doing that again next year.  Of course, we also partook in the after-Christmas shopping affair.  Ted, my mom, Trey and I awoke for 5:30 a.m. on December 26th, to catch the clearance sale at a local Hallmark.  Everything Christmas (but not the Christmas Yankee Candles) was 40% off, so I picked up some Christmas cards and a couple of ornaments for next year.  Afterwards, it was off to the grand Mall of Louisiana to spend more moolah.  Ted got some fancy new pants (he'll look nice); my mom and I chose some new makeup from Aveda (love that store).  I also scored an extremely discounted gift set from Bath and Body Works.  The scent: Rice Flower and Shea (yea Michelle, I thought it smelled so good, I bought myself some too!).  I also picked up some effervesent foot bath stuff for my foot spa.  Yes, it was a miracle, but I made it out of the mall without buying any shoes (or even setting foot into the Nine West store).    I also learned that there is a Yankee Candle Store in the Mall of Louisiana.  Yep, an entire store dedicated to the wonderfully scented candles that I've become absolutely addicted too.  For those who don't know, Yankee Candle makes the "Homewarmer" candle, a jar candle that lasts forever and fills your house with which ever scent you please.  There are tons of scents too!  From clean linen (white) to Midsummer's Night (black), there is a scent for every memory and every flower.  They also make votives and tea lights with the same smelling power.  I am a scented candle freak, and I love that these candles give off an odor that is strong enough to permiate a room, but not enough to overpower a person.  I'm excited about exploring the Yankee Candle store next time I'm in the Mall of Louisiana.  Friday night, we dined with Matt and Lauren, and Brian and Lisa.  We discovered over Margaritas and mexican at Serrano's that Brian and Lisa are engaged!  CONGRATS!!  Brian also ordered a salad as his meal... does anyone else find this strange??  Yep, we picked on him all night about it.  Afterwards, everyone came back to my place to watch a little television and just hang out.  Tommy and Becca joined us later that evening.  It was a great time with friends!  So, we have some upcoming events to announce:  January 4, 2004: Sugar Bowl Partey at Casa Del Newfield.  Arrive for 6 p.m.; Kickoff for 7 p.m.  Please bring something, anything, as long as it's to share.  Oh, and please RSVP your regrets so I can cook enough food!  January 10, 2004: Margaritaville at Casa Del Newfield.  Yeah this is a Tupperware party, but it'll include FREE MARGARITAS!!  Even if you don't want to buy anything, please join everyone for a good time.  The party begins for 7 p.m. and will include food and snacks!  Again, please RSVP your regrets so I can prepare enough for everyone!

      Tonight there was a great sporting match-up featured on the new Cox Sports channel on our local cable.  The basketball teams: UNO, a division 1-A NCAA team versus Loyola University New Orleans, who isn't even in the NCAA.  Yep, this was such a great match-up!  So great in fact, that the television viewer could count the number of people in attendance.  I must say that I don't think I've ever seen so many white young men on one basketball team since my days in PARDS b-ball in Denham Springs.  I guess this could be a statement about the demographics of Loyola U., maybe even about the strength of their basketball team.  I think I'll reserve my comments on that until the end of the game, however.   By the way, this is the first Loyola sporting event that I've ever seen, and I graduated from the school!  I think I can count on Loyola getting killed by UNO.  Go Wolfpack!!

      Well, today is my last day at work for the week.  In about three hours, I'll begin my Christmas vacation without a second glance.  Boy do I need this four-day holiday! Not that it will be any less busy.  Tomorrow begins the rush: Ted, Trey and I travel to the ever lovely Prairieville to celebrate Christmas with my father, stepmother and stepfamily.  Those who know me well just know how excited I am for this... woohoo, I can hardly contain myself.  Anyway, we will try to swallow down a meal before doing to whole gift exchange thing.  Afterwards, we jet on back to Metry to catch some shut eye so Santa can come for a visit.    Next morning, of course we wake early to find out what Santa brought us, then we get dressed to attend the wonderfully eye-opening 8 A.M. mass with Ted's family at St. Simon Peter... another woohoo, I can hardly wait.  Afterwards is breakfast (hopefully) and more gift exchanging before lunchtime.  We dine with Ted's parents, Rick, and Grandma LeBlanc (the other couple of the family are going to visit their other family for lunch) for lunch before leaving for Baton Rouge and my mother's house, where we will eat dinner and sleep for the night.  Yes, the bulk of my time will be spent on the road this holiday season.    Friday, I plan on getting my After-Christmas sale shopping on at the Mall of Louisiana.  If anyone is in the area and wants to join the fun, let me know.  Ted has to work unfortunately, so he gets to miss out, which I believe he is highly greatful for.  Trey and I will travel back to O' Metry after our expedition Friday.  Hopefully by Saturday, I'll get a chance to sleep some!  On a side note, I've grown accustomed to watching Fox and Friends in the morning.  They're pretty entertaining and yes, the news does seem to be more balanced than other channels.  However, these people are anything but perfect.  Every once in awhile, you'll see a screw up in the news ticker, or someone will say something so absolutely ridiculous.  Today, it was the latter.  Upon speaking of the doctor that saved Jessica Lynch (he was granted asylum by the US government and now lives in the US), one of the hosts makes the comment: "This will be a very happy Christmas for he and his family."  DOH!  Being a former citizen of Iraq, I can only guess that this man is probably Islamic... Islams celebrated Ramadan last month, which is equivalent to our Christmas celebration (kind of).   Oopsie!  Check out a couple of new blog links I've added.  My sister-in-law Michelle has a new blog.  I'm re-addng Eric Stoltz's blog now that he has it working (and actually updates it)!  Also, I've got a new home number, which I am definitely not posting here.  If you think you'll need it, e-mail me.  Have a happy holiday season everyone!

      This weekend just sparked the busyness that is Christmas week.  The last few days were spent with graduations, graduation parties, and stupid family parties.  Congrats to my bro-in-law, Paul, who successfully completed his studies at UNO.  The graduation ceremony wasn't THAT bad... okay, it was a little long: 2 1/2 hours.  The highlights, and I say this sarcastically, was the address by Sen. Landrieu and the 20 year-old PhD recepient.  Yes, I said 20 years-old.  You do the math on that one.  Saturday, Michelle's mother hosted a graduation party for Paul at her home.  It was a pretty good time; we got the hang out and goof around.  Next semester, I'll be back at the Lakefront Arena again to watch my husband Ted get his degree; we're already planning the extravaganza now!    Today was the inevitable LeBlanc family Christmas party, which is held every year on the Sunday before Christmas.  For those of you who do not know, this is Ted's mother's family; they're a pretty large bunch.  Every year, we see new and unidentifiable faces of cousins that Ted has never met.  And of course, no one knows how to get along.  Usually, we spend our time huddled in one group talking to only two or three people at the event.  This year wasn't really any different.  People came and ate food, then Grandma LeBlanc passed out her gifts to everyone (with the help of Santa).  After she was done with her fair and balanced gift giving (she gives everyone the same thing pretty much), the other family members started passing around their gifts.  Some people were snubbed for gifts, feelings were hurt.  Alas, this is all in a day's work for the LeBlanc Family Christmas party.  Ted's mom will be the host in two years, so Ted and I look forward to trying to resolve some of the problems with the event.  After today, thank God I only have to make it through Wednesday at work, because I sure am exhausted!    In case this is my only post before December 25th, I hope everyone has a safe and merry Christmas!

      For those who didn't know, I am a recovering "debater." No, not of the master kind, Paul.  I was Debate Club President in high school.  Beyond that, I just like to argue anything with anyone, but I'm sure most of you DO know that.  I have a tendency to play "devil's advocate" more often than not, just because I find it stimulating, trying to logically make a claim for one stance or another.  I get myself in lots of trouble with my husband, because he always assumes that I am trying to tell him that he's wrong... which isn't necessarily true, at least not a majority of the time.  I just like arguing!  It's hereditary; you should see my brother and I go at it.  Over the past few weeks, months even, I've been boiling to spout out some good rants on US politics in general.  I think I've done a fairly good job of containing my diatribe.  Besides in a courtroom, I doubt anyone sees more argumentation or rhetoric than a politician.  Have you listened to these people lately?  On one side we have the "jackass" democrats (AKA: Poor, suffering whiners) who are in this almost comical attack mode as of late against the arch-enemy, the never forgetful "elephant" Republican Party (AKA: Five-year-old elitests).  Each side has attempted to make appealing arguments on all variety of issues, from important to the mundane.  What have I heard?  Nothing but logical fallacies.  Let's use the War on Iraq as our example today.  First the democrats have a point, albeit a weak one.  The current "Republican" generic justification for the war is what is called an  Ad hoc  logical fallacy, which literally means "after the fact."  Remember the story: "we were going to Iraq to protect our country from WMD, but since we haven't found WMD the war is still justified because Saddam was an ass." Yeah, Saddam was an ass when we started the whole affair, and his internal legitimacy as a leader was certainly questionable and more than enough reason to wage an offensive war.  In other words, whomever decided to argue for this war in the first place made the mistake of using the wrong evidence.  Tell me if I'm wrong, but aren't we taught from grade school up to verify the validity of our evidence (facts, research, whatever you want to call it)?  I digress.  So a few people made a big "boo-boo" from inside the Bush administration; and, whether they were the culprit or not, someone has taken the blame for the mistake... kind of.  Should be the end of it right?  But of course not, this is America after all.  Nope, we instead get blessed with mounds and mounds of whining which have simply boiled down to  Argumentaum ad hominem  -- argument against man.  "Mr. XYZ and his colleague Mr. DCB aren't to blame for this mess, the entire Republican party is to blame because they are a bunch of idiots, just like their idiot Texas president."  Sound familiar?  This is pretty much the rhetoric of the "debates" between the Democratic primary candidates.  Who can make the better sounding attack.  *rolling my eyes*   And the freakin' "Republican leadership" doesn't get much better with their  Tu quoque  retorts.  To quote Pee-Wee Herman, "I know you are, but what am I?"  Since when did we all revert back to Kindergarten?  In Kindergarten, none of us were expected to plead a case based on factual evidence.  We weren't expected to create intricate arguments designed to sway the listener to one way of thinking.  Nope, not until college do some people even remotely experience a full-fledged lesson in how to write an argumentative essay.  This is the point when we start learning about logical fallacies, arguments that might sound good but are ultimately arrived at through false means.  This is where we are SUPPOSE to learn that "because I said so" just isn't a good enough argument response.  Unfortunately, we adults can't seem to get over what appears to be our trained "stupid" responses.  And you know, we've all fallen for it: hook, line and sinker.  Yep, we've now succumbed to making these broad generalizations about people solely based on whether they vote Democrat or Republican.  We all attack each other, blaming the other for what's wrong with the world, the environment, and the Cox cable internet that never seems to work right.  The letter R or D now speaks for us; we don't even have to open our mouth before the words are put in by someone else.  In an ideal world, I guess that could be kind of interesting:  never having to think for ourselves because we are too busy thinking solely for someone else.  Hey, I know some people who could definitely benefit from that!  Unfortunately, I can't stand playing that game.  I have too much fun thinking to allow someone else to do it for me!  Quite honestly, I'm tired of the stupidity that has been chosen to represent me.  Excuse my language, but FUCK the Ivy League educations and FUCK the millions of bucks they've made.  Stupid is as stupid does, as Forrest Gump said.  Sure, you might have two degrees from Yale and 2 mil. in the bank, but if you sound like an idiot, you will be perceived as an idiot.  Quite honestly, I'm embarrassed for the whole lot because they sound down right dumb!  You think some fancy, Armani suited politician had anything, ANYTHING to do with finding Saddam over the weekend?  Other than sending the troops over in the first place, absolutely nada!  Could you just imagine what this whole "war" would look like if we sent the politicians over to fight and left the soldiers in the homeland?  Yep, I'm chortling at the ridiculous picture myself.  But alas, on the ole homeland we are in a war of words.  Great, so we've decided rhetoric is the weapon of choice between the donkeys and the elephants.  Perhaps now would be a good time to learn how to use our words properly, nes pas?  What we all need is a bare bones basic lesson in argumentation.  We need to learn how to argue a good point (RE: arguing which political party was responsible for Saddam is what's called a bad point) AND still get our shit accomplished.  We definitely need to learn to realize fallacies in our rhetoric.  We all need to make sure that when we back up a claim, we aren't doing it with thin air!  Ignorance cannot be an excuse anymore.  After that, I'd say we probably need a new political party up in here: the Republican leadership is too conservative for me, but the Democratic leadership is way too liberal.  So what are we gonna do about it?

      This weekend was perhaps one of the most bazaar of my life.  Yep, from being the possible odd man out on Friday, LSU overcame USC to be in contension for the BCS championship/National Championship.  At the beginning of the Saints game on Sunday, I was even wondering if a Saints miracle was even a possibility, but alas hell has not frozen over, nor have pigs begun to fly.  Needless to say, something I thought I would never see in my lifetime may very well become reality on January 4th, and I can't be happier.  Even if LSU doesn't pull out a victory, I still believe my hometown team will be a force to be reckoned with in years to come; a fact that I look forward to as well.  Unfortunately, I definitely don't have the spare resources to fork over a couple grand for the Sugar Bowl, particularly when I have a nice 32" and a comfortable couch less that 15 miles from the action.  Ted and I would like to invite all our other "unfortunate" friends over for the game on Jan. 4th though!  In an interesting twist of fate, while I won't be attending the biggest game LSU has seen since the early 80's, my trusty little Gateway laptop will.  I don't know, I thought it was pretty funny thing last night when Ted told me.  May it bring the Tigers luck (and me a very nice meal)!  WWE Armageddon, presented in conjunction with the tasty wings of Wing Zone, is Sunday.  Yeah, Sunday is also an eveningtime Saints game, but in light of their recent performance, I think you would be less frustrated if you came for wrestling.  Admission is something to eat or drink.  For the ladies who are uninterested in the action, we will be having a "chick night" filled with estrogenesque activities, perhaps sushi and a movie.  Are you in or are you out?  Let me know.  For those who are too lazy to brave the mall, I'm having a Tupperware party this Saturday at 6 p.m.  I'll be making dinner and there will be a yummy desert as well!  Can't come, but want to buy anyway... just let me know, I have catalogs handy.  All orders need to be in by the 13th, or face an ultra-steep rush charge for Christmas.  Again, let me know!

      Between Saturday and today, I have taught myself far more about Pericles than I probably ever wanted to know.  For those who have never read the late Shakespeare romantic play, let me summarize the plot.  The story opens with incest..yep, incest.  Hero Prince Pericles arrives at the city of Antioch to marry the "maiden of the manor." (She is never named).  Many men have died at the hands of her father because of the unsolvable riddle he has made as a test for her suitors.  Yep, the riddle is about a father, who is also husband and brother; and a child who is both wife and sister.  Uh-huh, this is sounding like Livingston Parish up in here!  So, Pericles is rightfully repulsed by the incestuous duo, refuses to answer the riddle and flees Antioch to escape death.  Thus begins the tests that only Greek gods can inflict upon their eipc literary heros.  I mean, this guy's life sucks.  He marries a young, hot thing, who is pregnant and giving birth less than twenty lines later.  She "dies" in childbirth and gets thrown overboard (seamen's superstition).  The child is left on another island with the "wicked stepmother."  In the end, everyone is reunited... happy, happy.. joy, joy.  This is not one of Shakespeare's better plays in my opinion, as far as reading goes.  I do think much of the drama is in the actual production though.  SO, now you know as much as I do... HA HA.  Glad I could make others suffer as well.  The sentence that Ted of course found in my paper: "Pericles' parts are filled with exclamation points."  We decided after I wrote this long and drawn out description of a film adaptation that Pericles would make a great porn!  Lexington Steele would of course play the part of Pericles.  Yep, Pericles, Prince of Thong...  Anyway, we have a new member in our household.  She's a cute little kitty who has no name!  Actually, I think I will call her Luna because she only comes out at night.  She also bites the toes of sleeping adults, but that's another story for another day.

      Okay, Thanksgiving is now over and the mass hysteria known as the "holiday season" is now in full swing.  For the next 24 days, we can all expect lines and crowds at every shopping venue we might chance to visit.  Of course, we can also expect to be enundated with the strains of Christmas music at all stops as well.  Yes, I know that I sound a trifle "hum-buggy," but I am a retail veteran and spouse to a "Christmas Carol Lover" who's capacity to contain his caroling to only the next 25 days is nil.  Decking the halls and fa la la-ing at every turn gets to be a little too much, particularly when your husband insists on sleeping to the Sounds of the Season music channel on digital cable.  I digress...  Thanksgiving itself was an interesting experience.  I got to see relatives that I haven't seen in years.  As is often the case is situations such as this, one usually has the opportunity to make some great realization about their family.  Mine: my family is a bunch of rednecks!  This isn't some new realization, really.  Ted has been picking on me for years about the step-family I usually choose to ignore except for the one holiday we are all called to gather for.  They've got that "twang" and the aptitude for spouting out the dumbest things.  They all look at me as if I am some alien, the prodigal daughter or some nonsense like that.  I've known this and tolerated it for some time, perhaps even become immune to it.  But I realized this past turkey day, that my Mom's side is just as bad!  Perhaps it was the realization of how different I am from them.  During that day, they all spoke of country music singers and "huntin';" one of my cousin's had a spouse and children dressed in full out camo for the day.  I didn't have any clue what they were talking about!  When I did know something, I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want to seem like the proverbial "Miss Know-it-all".  I'm the only college grad in the family; I've got the good job in the "city" (One of my cousins actually told me that).  It was a really weird feeling.  I guess my second realization is that I have definitely become a city girl, or a suburb girl at least.  Sure, I'd love to have a house in the middle of nowhere with nature all around, but I am certainly not willing to give up the luxuries of Takeout Taxi and Super Wal-mart.  If I could afford it, I'd own nice, sophisticated clothing and get weekly manicures and pedicures.  I'm into the latest technology and educating myself on everything I can get my hands on.  I wouldn't say I am particularly trendy, but I do like classy looking things and strive to achieve that level of sophistication in all levels of my life one day.  This concept is completely lost upon most of my relatives I think.  Sure, they are all great people, but I just don't feel as if I can identify with any of them, nor they to me.  It's like existing on two seperate areas of the same shared existence.  I don't know... maybe I'm just suffering from a bad case of elitism.  *sigh*    *WRESTLING ANNOUNCEMENT*   Let this be advanced warning or what have you.  We will be hosting the next wrestling pay-per-view at our house.  Everyone is welcome to attend.  Please bring at least one food or drink item to share, whatever is within your budgetary means.  Monetary donations to help defray the cost of the event are appreciated, but not necessary for attendance.  Please let Ted or I know if you will be able to attend.  Girls, we can plan to do something fun while the guys watch their male soap opera.  Perhaps a sushi girls night out?    Oh, and I almost forgot the special shout out:   BECCA YOU ROCK!!   Good luck to my friends in retail, Jess and Becca, I hope you survive the holiday season unscathed and richer!

      For those of you who are wondering where your high priced plastic stuff is, all 25.56 lbs of it are currently located in Florence, SC.  The nice people of Fed-Ex Home Delivery, neighbors to Ted's own @ Your Service Technology Solutions, expect to make the hop, skip, and jump down the way to deliver your fine stuff on or before February 3, 2004.  That's Tuesday, for those who never have the time to look at a calendar, which is a mere four days from now (if you include the rest of this fine TGIF).  Be on the look out (BOLO for the Loyola crowd) for an announcement on this here blog when your treasures have arrived.  I'll also be calling you to make arrangements if I don't here from you first.  These people just might get things hand delivered directly to you:  my mom and sister-in-law way up in Tigerland.  Call me to make arrangements for the next weekend, please.  I am being deprived of scrapbooking with the pro in Baton Rouge tonight in lieu of bonding time with the hubby and offspring (okay, family is definitely more important so it isn't too bad).  I will not be denied however!  So, cropping alone I will be tonight.  Becca and Ashley, if you are free and not making the trek to Sugar Bowl Ave., give me a call or send an e-mail and maybe we can arrange a crafty evening (I've got to pass it by Ted first, though).  Have a great day all!

      Is it just me, or when you think of Mr. Phil, do you think of Michael Jackson?  Just wondering...

      I want to know:  Why do men decide to specialize in obstetrics and gynecology?  What could possible attract a man to inspecting the arrid nether regions of the female anatomy?  Sometimes, I wonder if the decision to specialize was made during some sort of fit of immaturity during med school.  We all remember jr. high school (middle school for some), ALL the boys wanted to be OB-GYN's back then.  But as we get older, most of these young men grow out of this phase... I can only guess that this realization comes with the equally disturbing not all female crotches are nice, pretty, and smell like flowers realization -- UGH!.  But some men, they prevail and make that final sacrifice into physician's land as a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology.  WHY?  The perks just can't be all that good... unless of course your OB-GYN is a womanizing louse, in which case it might be a good idea to seek another care giver.  Assuming that you have a respectable male OB-GYN, how does one interact with their female significant other?  "Gee Honey, I saw a quite a few today, but none of them look as good as yours."  What about the more intimate sides of the relationship?  How does he prevent himself from inspecting his loved one while he's getting on with the foreplay?  I just don't understand how that can work.

      Sleep has become something almost sacred to me in the last few years.  On a good night, I can fall asleep and stay asleep until it's time to wake-up.  This rarely ever happens between how lightly I sleep, Ted moving around, Trey climbing into bed, and the cat crying.  Even more often, I have an absolutely impossible time falling asleep to begin with.  Needless to say, I've gone 24, 48, even 72-hours without sleep or with little sleep (maybe 2 hrs a night) in the last few months.  It freaking sucks because I always feel like crap the next day.    I was prescribed some meds a few months ago to help with my "issues" as I call them.  The nice pills aren't doing what they are suppose to do, at all.  At first, I was sleeping like a baby, waking at 5 a.m. in the morning feeling refreshed and ready to go.  Not anymore.  Yesterday, at my monthly visit.  I got a new script, so we shall see how this works.  The side effects are pretty scary: they call it "instant old age" with weight gain, hair loss, and stomach issues being the most prevalent.  The med also does a workout on the liver, so no more alcohol for me (only on special, rare occasions).  I've also got to watch out for pancreatis and flesh-eating bacteria... YEAH!  Those are some of the more rare side effects of course, but it's pretty entertaining to mention flesh-eating bacteria.  Someone even reported "enlarging of the breasts" as a side effect.  Obviously, some people are just stupid.  If my breasts get any bigger, I'll be looking for a plastic surgeon.  Not much else going on.  Getting back into the habit of work at my office again after two weeks of laziness.  Friday, I plan on scrapbooking at Michelle's, then spending the night for the Vet School Open House on Saturday.  Trey will definitely have a blast.

      I liked it.  Thought I'd share a little culture today: Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain; Lest sorrow lend me words and words express The manner of my pity-wanting pain. If I might teach thee wit, better it were, Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so; As testy sick men, when their deaths be near, No news but health from their physicians know; For if I should despair, I should grow mad, And in my madness might speak ill of thee: Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad, Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be, That I may not be so, nor thou belied, Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.

      Everyone deserves a buddy!  I'm in Kevin Smith mode today after watching the trailer for Jersey Girl this morning.  Kevin Smith is one smart man, I tell you.  He knows J. Lo can't act, so he kills her off within 12 minutes!  Needless to say, this looks like a great movie.  Even though Jay and Silent Bob will not be appearing, I am happy to say George Carlin looks to be a pretty centralized supporting character.  Any film with George Carlin is great, no matter what his role.  Yes, the film is safe.  I don't think we'll see in Gigli action with this one.  Kevin Smith is too much of a comedic genius!!  Anyway, I'm back home from my trips to nowhere.  I now have to review awards so C. Ford can shut the F up!  When will a Kiwanis governor grow some balls and fire him?  Yeah, yeah... when pigs fly, hell freezes over, or the Saints win a Sugar Bowl.  Anyway, it's good to be back from the beyond and surprisingly entertaining to be in the position of pissing Charlie off once again.  I haven't had a chance to do that is almost two years... I think I was having withdrawal or something.  Whoa... he's even had a mention in TWO posts. I sincerely apologize to my readers... I won't blaspheme again.  Today, I am off to UNO to get some stuff done for Ted, mainly order his ring and pick up a CD of lectures for one of his online classes.  Ted ended up having to leave work early to retrieve Trey yesterday, so he won't be able to help with the choosing of the ring,  but he's already said what he wanted, so all I need to do is actually make it happen.  He gets a free cap and gown for placing his order... ARTCARVED ROCKS!!  As if anyone could forget: Royal Rumble is this weekend.  Please bring something share with everyone else.  If you think about it, please let Ted and I know what that something is so we can plan around it.  Appreciate it!

      I think some people just live for those days when they can jump on someone's case.  These people make themselves feel oh so important and almighty by putting down others and pointing out their every last mistake.  I guess this makes them feel supreme or something, although they are 1 - far from perfect and 2 - uncomfortable about hearing about their own imperfection in the same manner that they dole out the criticism on others.  Damned if I don't enjoy pointing out number 2 when I am faced with jerk-offs like this.  I also think most of you can imagine who I am talking about when you think about the subject of my post today.  Some people think of FORD as Found On Road Dead or maybe Fix Or Repair Daily.  The type of FORD I refer to cannot be explained by these acronyms.  Nope, definitely not that type of FORD, but perhaps a Fat Overweight Recurring Drinker or a Feet Observing Relaxed Drunk.  I dunno.  Needless to say, this FORD needs to take a few classes in patience and communication skills.  I hope that 1 - FORD catches a hint with an earlier communication from me; and 2 - the others who get FORD's blessed blathering won't feel too upset over it.  Just in case, I thought I would talk about how to deal with FORD.  FORD is like diarrhea.  It's a pain in the ass that has its own time frame that demands immediate attention.  Each also require an I-word, Imodium for diarrhea Ignore for FORD.  Yep folks, just ignore the FORD and he will go away (or at least learn some manners).  If that doesn't work, give FORD a little of it's own medicine.  Trust me, he'll learn who he can't push around.  Don't be afraid of FORD.  If FORD intimidates you, just think of talking feet!

      An oxymoron, right?  Oh yeah.  As seen on page A-7 of the T-P today:       The owner of a popular Treme bar shot and killed a 51-year-old New Orleans man who wouldn't stop selling beer in front of his business Sunday evening, police said.      "It's unclear just what drove Joseph 'Papa Joe' Glasper, Jr., owner of Joe's Cozy Corner, to draw a weapon and open fire," said a NOPD spokesman.  REALLY?  Hmm... I thought that was apparently clear in the first statement, but I could be wrong...  Gotta love New Orleans.

      Well, I'm ba-ack!  Back from hell, that is.  I thought about writing about all the odd things I saw as an ode to the sarcastic stylings of Paul Newfield; however, I'm pretty tired and apparently don't have as much energy as he has to dedicate to such daitribes.  I will say this: I just spent most of last week working out of Hackberry, LA, where the only radio stations are either country, cajun, christian, or hispanic.  A scary place indeed.  The Wal-Mart of lovely Sulphur had five sections in it's music section: Rock, Pop, and R&B; Country; Cajun;  Christian; and Children.  While lodging at the Hampton Inn, I had the opportunity to view a Jewish televangelist (??) and a "Feed the Starving Kids of the U.S" commercial ala Sally Struthers' starving Ethiopians.  Geez, even the television was different!  Altogether, the trip was interesting.  I'm looking forward to my next adventure, if only to escape my cat and her mewling!  I have officially entered the realm of matrondom, as I am happy to say that Ted and I are the proud new owners of a Hoover vacuum.  Our old vacuum decided to cease doing a pretty important function (i.e. - sucking!), so replacing it was in order.  The fact that I am excited about getting a new vacuum kind of worries me, but I think I can get over it in due time.  The new machine cleans carpet and bare floor, so maybe I am just excited because I won't have to sweep as much.  I don't know.  Going to Paul and Michelle's tomorrow for the spa thing.  I am pretty excited!  I definitely need the relaxation because I've been feeling rather "blah" lately.  Speaking of, I'm off to bed.  I am SO worn out!!

      Most of my friends are in that nesting phase of life:  finish school, get a job, find a mate, settle down, have some children, etc.  For those of you thinking of starting a family in the near, or not-so-near future, here's some advice.  No matter how tired you are after getting zero amounts of sleep during the first few weeks home with the new baby (not to mention to little sleep you get before giving birth ladies), DO NOT under any means, bring the child to bed with you.  While this seems like a great idea (the baby gets sleep, I get sleep), you WILL regret it in the long run.  Take me for example:  last night, I slept with a cat, a two-year-old, and Ted all in one bed.  We have a queen-sized bed.  It doesn't take someone good in geometry to guess it was pretty cramped... not to mention my child doesn't stop moving, even in his sleep!    I am such a sucker though.  I can't stand for my child to suffer, and crying equals suffering to me.  I also demand my fair share of sleep.  So, it is usually at 3 a.m. or so that I get slapped in the face by a little child crying "mommy."  I heft the little guy up and over to plant him in the middle of the bed.  Sometimes I get the pleasure of shoving Ted out of the way, but even he has grown use to reserving Trey's spot... just in case.  Ted, of course, never wakes up regardless.  Damn all you heavy sleepers... damn, damn, damn!  Trey, of course, if the first to fall back into a fitful slumber, with one foot touching his daddy and his hand on mommy's cheek.  It sounds cute doesn't it?  Yeah, yeah... I guess that's why I let him do what he does.  It's cute; he's cute.  Boy will he be trouble when he gets older!

      There are idiots abound in our world today.  If you don't see it, then you must be bored because their stupid acts are nothing but fodder for the amusement of us "higher thinking" types.  Some of these idiots somehow manage to gain position and status... which makes their random acts of stupidity all the more public, which allows for more wide range entertainment, of course.    Example:  Today, Ted and I were sitting in the "guest room" of the Elmwood Pep Boys, waiting for my car to have it's battery replaced.  For the entertainment of their unfortunate "guests," Pep Boys have a tiny 15" - 19" television tuned to NBC.  Katie and Matt had just finished discussing a group of people who "foiled" an entire apartment, leaving only the television screen and the exit unwrapped, but that's a story for another blog day.  Cut to the commercials... particularly a spot for the local NBC station's news update.  The story of the day, of course, is the Gubernatorial Inauguration in Baton Rouge... the current state capital since 1849.  In this quick news flash, Roop Raj tells us viewers that their coverage of the inauguration will begin at 11 A.M., then mentions that tonight the inaugural ball will be held in New Orleans for the first time tonight.  HUH?!?  Prior to 1849, wasn't the state capital located in none other than NEW ORLEANS?  And being the refined culture that we all know we are, were not balls hosted at the slightest provocation for anything under the sun during that time?  That being asked, wouldn't it be logical, although obviously not documented per se, that there has been at some other time in New Orleans, an inaugural ball?  In 1845, legislation passed allowing for the popular vote of governor.  Prior, the governor was appointed by the legislature.  Perhaps there wasn't an election in the four years between this change and the move to Baton Rouge.  Perhaps previous governorships just "don't count."  I'd say that most assuredly since the Devember 18, 1948, inception of channel 6 here in NOLA there has not been an inaugural ball in New Orleans.  Ted and I think it was just a blatantly dumb comment to make.  Ahhh... newspeople.  As you can tell, I've had a fun and event-filled morning.  My car, while starting perfectly this morning, decided to die outside the daycare parking lot.  Of course, after much bitching and complaining this led Ted to meet me in Harahan for a not-so-quick "jump" before heading to the friendly and effervescent people of Pep Boys.  2-hours later and $90 poorer, I made my way to work to generally look busy as I feel that I've already done enough for the day.  Afterall, my next few days will consist of 10 hour days as I go on the road to visit the town which eminates that interesting odor on the way to Texas: Sulphur.  Life is grand, ain't it?  Useless fact of the day:  In 1778, William Pollock, a New Orleans businessman, created the "$" sign.

I set up another cool layout there too!  Nothing like a fresh look to begin a new year.  So, I found this funny webpage purely by accident.  At first it doesn't look like much, but just wait for the text box...  Check out this amusing 404 error page  urlLink here .  Margaritas and tupperware, tomorrow night, 7 p.m.  All are welcome!

      Well, I felt like being a rebel... being different, so I gots me a new blogging look!  Whatcha think?  Pretty sweet huh?  Well, other that wasting half a day re-creating my blog (damn Haloscan must always cause problems!), nothing much going on 'round here.  Of course, Margaritaville at Casa Del Newfield is coming up on Saturday night.  I'm thinking of making some fresh strawberry syrup for some yummy strawberry margaritas... but only if I can find some decent berries.  Next week is my first site visit.  Out-of-town travel, fun!  I'll be doing a marathon trip through all four site in the next two months because of a project I am working on.  I even get to fly for free!  Hey... I'm excited; I've never flown before!  In more work news, they may extend my contract again (pending the head honcho's approval), which would put me in this position for over a year!  I'm hoping that it works out for me.  Well, I must be off.  Au revoir mon amis!

      Since everyone else is enumerating what sugar bowl paraphenalia they have, I thought I would brag.  My husband is a wonderful, alert person when attending to work matters.  The day following the game, Ted went to the Hyatt to retrieve the equipment from Nokia.  What did he find there?  None other than the official Sugar Bowl media guides for both LSU and Oklahoma.  These guides are not sold to the public, but are given to members of the media who cover the event.  Each guide gives a nice little history of the team and information about it's current players.  LSU's guide is going for as high as $49 on eBay, but I expect that to increase as time goes on because these are pretty rare.   Go Ted for finding a priceless collectible!  Of course, I was also on the computer (or Ted was at least) purchasing the official championship shirts and hats as soon as the game was over.  I'm hoping that Musemeche or one of the other Baton Rouge photo studios that follows the LSU teams around has some good pictures on sale as well.

      Okay, I think I am somewhat over the excitement of Sunday night.  Quite honestly, I never thought I would see it happen, a national championship for the Tiger football team.  It was one of those things I wanted to see before I died.  At least I can now cross one thing off the list.  As for USC, they can kiss my ass because they don't share squat.  I think Sean made the best explanation of the situation: USC is a national champion just like Al Gore is U.S. President.  In other words, just because they won the "popular vote" doesn't make them the championship.  I guess you can call the BCS the electoral college.  Maybe they should make a school house rock song for the BCS too.  On other news, I had a thought (yes, surprising isn't it).  Perhaps Kiwanis would have more money if they didn't pay for a float in the Rose Bowl Parade every year.  I dunno... like I said, it was just a thought.    Moving on, I have a question for you sports nuts out there: has there ever been a time in NCAA history that a school has won a football national championship, a basketball national championship, and a baseball national championship all within the same school year?  Just wondering....  Margaritaville at Casa Del Newfield is this weekend.  It Saturday night, 7 p.m. to be exact.  Yeah, this is a Tupperware Party... but that doesn't make the margaritas any less alcoholic or the fun any less.  So, contact me ASAP if you'd like to attend.  We'll be making some authentic cuisine and of course drinking!

      eBay is a beautiful, wonderful invention!  At no other place can one find half-price designer shoes and hard-to-find collectible Winnie-the-Pooh salt shakers, but this isn't the real reason why I hail the giant of internet auctioning.  No, today I thank eBay for the mass availability of toddler clothing.  As anyone who has had children can attest, they go through clothing with frightening spurts of speed.  For what seems like a brief moment, your child is at size 24M only to reach a "growth spurt" and need a 2T.   (We can of course leave the debate that 24 months is also 2 years for a letter to clothing designers worldwide.)  You also have that thing called the change of seasons... or as we in Louisiana like to call "being prepared."  Most certainly, your child is NEVER the same size as they were last year, so lucky you (and your child) you must go shopping for a whole new wardrobe.  And one wonders where this obsession with new fashion derives itself from??  Has anyone been shopping for toddler clothing lately?  I'm not talking about the Wal-mart brand stuff that falls apart after two or three washes... no, the good stuff: Old Navy, Gap, Osh Kosh, etc., etc.  We're talking $15 for a pair of shorts.  Lucky for us, our child is super-slim with the height of a 2T, so we must scour the mallside for "adjustable waistbands," which we've only found on Gap and Tommy Hilfiger items.  Gap's adjustible waistband items can run as much as $30 for a paid of convertible pants/shorts, with the Tommy shorts running close to $40, EH-GADS!!  I wouldn't pay $40 for a pair of shorts for myself, much less for shorts made from about a 1/4 of the fabric.  eBay has proven to be a lifesaver.  I've managed to purchase four outfits and a pair of pants for the price of one brand new pair of Tommy pants.  Sure, most of the stuff is used, but with children's clothes... they don't fit for very long, so they are all practically brand new.  I even found a pair of brand new Gap cargo pants for $10!  So now, Trey can have great clothes that last (and fit -- no more falling down!) for much cheaper that we expected.  YEAH eBAY!

      So, tomorrow is the day for this portion of the Newfield clan.  Our own Mardi Gras Day... eventhough it's more like Dimanche Gras.  Because I have to go to work on site very early Wednesday morning in Plaquemine, LA, we've decided to opt out of the traditional Fat Tuesday festivities.  This year, we were actually organized about attending the Uptown parades: we have drinks, ice, liquor, sandwiches, and Naked Potato Salad (in honor of the flashers) all ready to go for tomorrow.  We've even planned to share with anyone who plans on joining us!  Also, because Ted wants a prime spot, we plan on being camped out on Napoleon and Chestnut at 7 AM!!  It's going to be an early and active morning around here!  Funny story:  I went to Sav-a-center to pick up a few last minute items this evening.  I was wearing my Circle K YOS shirt (Year of Service) from way back in the day (I think 1999 *gasp*).  Wouldn't you know, some random man waited for me to finish checking out at the handy little self checkout just so he could ask me if my shirt was in relation to the convenience store of the same name.  Keep in mind, this shirt has in  pretty big letters: 14,000 members/555 Clubs/363,000 Service Hours.  It was funny, and I guess ironic, being asked that after so many years.  Yep, I figured out the other day that I was a member of the K-Family in some capacity for 10 years... a decade!  That's a long time.    Well, it's an early morning for me, so let the good times roll!

      Turns out there are many Amanda's all receiving hugs, so I changed my name.  I'm now back to one measly hug, but at least the counter will be accurate.  So, I'm trying to guess how to do this Trackback thing.  Eric Stoltz is using trackback on his  urlLink blog .  So... where do I go from here??  Turns out, this is still in a pretty infantile stage and is completely manual (RE: a pain in the ass).  One must log-on to their haloscan account, click on Manage Trackback, then click Send Trackback Pings all from the Haloscan page.  Oh yeah... you have to get the link to ping to from the blog before doing all of this.  Ooh.. and you  must have the permalink from your own post as well, that's the pound sign at the end!   Did I mention it was a pain in the ass??  It will be interesting to use this on occasion... particularly when we get into our debates that we all have the tendency of joining in.

      Haloscan has a new FREE feature.  Gotta love anything that's free.  It's called "Trackback."  I have no clue what it is, but it's here, so try it out or something.  Also, I moved my "Lovin' Meter", so don't forget to give me some sugar!  Mardi Gras = Love people.  Afterall, if you can get drunk and make out with random strangers on Bourbon, you should at least be able to give me an e-hug. :-)  Just kidding!  Enjoy!

      Has anyone else noticed the ads on Haloscan?  It's something they just started doing; probably to pay for the extensive servers they must run for the entire blogging world.  Anyway, the ads are pretty random.  The best thus far: "Gay Penguin for President."  Yes, this is an entire site dedicated to talking about why a gay penguin would be better than Bush for President.  It's completely pointless and often times very grating, but the bio for the "gay penguin" is pretty funny.  Check out the gay penguin at  urlLink http://www.gaypenguinforamerica.com/ .  Now for SWO.  Many people have been asking me what is SWO, and what type of crack Ted and I are smoking.  First, no we aren't smoking crack.  Although sometimes I do wonder about the sanity level of my husband at times, I think he has some type of point he is working towards at this time, but I don't know for sure.  Mostly, I think he was annoyed with all us "serious types" having discussions about politics, Jesus and his possible wife Mary.  This is where the whole smurf blog came from in its whole annoying form.  SWO has something to do with wrestling because it stands for Smurf World Order (i.e. -- NWO (New World Order) was a bunch of old wrestling superstars??).  Ted just received a copy of the Monday Night War, so he is all hyped on the NWO right now.  I am female and do not really pay attention to wrestling (as much as my husband tries to educate me), but I think that Ted, and a few others who were over at my house this past Sunday, have decided that the SWO needs to make an appearance at this year's district convention.  I guess the SWO can be summed up as the happy-go-lucky, service do-gooders who are happy to have everything go along peacefully, or smurfily as the case may be.  Ted wants to make this completely random, with surprise things like t-shirts and hats appearing on people throughout convention.  I guess it's just one way to have some fun... like an inside joke or something.  I guess if you are interested in being random, contact  urlLink Ted  because he's the man with the plan.  Otherwise, you can just make fun of us at convention, which is completely within your right to do. :-)  And now, it's quiz time again!  Thanks to  urlLink Ali  for finding this incredibly brief quiz!    Your: Wondering eyes. Your not quite focused and your quite the day dreamer. Your a bit odd and as many say "Your head is in the clouds."   urlLink   What type of eyes do you have?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I'm almost out the door after another day.  Good news!  I've been accepted for a return to school in the fall for post-Baccalaureate work in Computer Information Sciences at Loyola Universty New Orleans.  I'm pretty excited because of all the doors this could eventually open up for me.  As you all probably know, I want to be a technical writer; I even do a little technical writing work now.  This certification will give me some much needed background to kickstart my career in that arena.  Unfortunately, another family pet passed away Monday.  J.P. (short for Just a Pussy) passed away from renal failure after nearly a week in a vet hospital in Baton Rouge.  He was probably ten years old.  J.P. was originally aquired as my pet in the summer after I graduated from high school.  He was a fluffy little sucker, who was probably either a Himalayan or a Ragdoll pedigree.  He was extremely calm for a cat and would let anyone do anything to him.  The woman who gave J.P. to me said that her roommate's daughter use to play dress-up with him and he would let her!  I've never met another cat like that.  As cats always do, the opposite of what we wanted to happen occurred; Bloomer picked me and J.P. picked my mom.  He's been a pretty faithful cat to her over the years since, sleeping at the foot of her bed at night and napping in her lap during the day.  I'll miss seeing him when I visit my mom.

      Well, I hope everyone had an excellent Valentine's Weekend.  Ted and I celebrated Valentine's Day by attending the Inaugural New Orleans Voodoo Game, which was tons of fun.  We followed our afternoon with dinner from Foodies Kitchen and a night of movies and music at home.  Sunday, we hosted the WWE PPV for the month.  It was a pretty nice weekend.  Mardi Gras is practically upon us now.  Oh joy!  Sorry, I can't gather too much energy for Mardi Gras because I am still recovering from the traumatic experiences of marching while in high school.  I'll have a little bit more fun once I get to an actual parade.  Ted, Trey and I will only be attending the Thoth/Bacchus day of parades this year because I have to go to Plaquemine (not to be confused with Plaquemines Parish) the day after Mardi Gras for some work.  Ted is especially looking forward to the Smurf float in this year's Thoth parade.  I am hoping they have throws that will fit in nicely with the SWO theme.  In as much, I better see Tommy at the parade!  :-)  Mardi Gras Day, I plan on Cropping 'Till I Drop at Mrs. Damaris' house.  My Valentine's gift from Ted was lots of scrapbooking tools, so I can't wait to get a chance to use them!  Other than that, I have a Mary Kay Glamour Party planned for Saturday, February 28th.  I've already won some free stuff for that!  If you are interested in attending, please let me know!

      I've been wanting to put that in the subject line for weeks now!  Today marks the day that Luna will lose her ability to reproduce... and her ability to scratch the crap out of everyone in the household.  I woke up early and drove across the river to the Companion Animal Clinic / Aurora Animal Hospital, who has excellent prices on their services (and are way nicer than the last vet I visited).  Sometime today, Luna will be spayed, declawed, and vaccinated; she'll come home tomorrow.    If you didn't know, I've literally been living with a "bitch in heat" for the last month or so.  Luna has been crying like crazy at the most inappropriate hours (usually while everyone else is sleeping) and of course, there is the whole "back that ass up" thing she keeps doing.  This is on top of all her usual "I must have attention at all times" antics, so living with her has been a little frustrating.  I guess ultimately, it helps to have a sense of humor about the entire experience.  She is such a sweet natured cat that it is really hard staying aggravated with her for very long.  Thank God most of her crying will disappear after the spaying!  Yippee for us!  The taxes are complete thanks to  urlLink turbotax.com .  This site is probably one of the best things ever invented.  No software to buy; no tax preparer to deal with.  Best of all... direct deposit to your checking or savings account!  The product is really thorough, and you don't ever have to mail anything in.  I've been using Turbotax online for several years now.  Louisiana sends their refunds in something short of a week (for a state who is slow in every other possible way, it is amazing how fast they get those refunds out).  Federal taxes about two to three weeks.  I swear it takes more time waiting for the stupid W-2's to come in!  This weekend is the inaugural home game for the New Orleans Voodoo.  Ted and I will be sitting in the 18th row of section 102 for this game.  This was my Valentine's gift to Ted... aren't I a good wife?  Afterwards, we plan on eating our gourmet to-go from Foodies Kitchen and then relaxing at home sans bebe.  Sunday will be pretty busy in preparation for the monthly PPV.  Coming up on the 28th is Glamour Night at my house.  The beauty party begins at 6:00 p.m.

      Well, I think I've finally gotten my shit together and have enough support to start the Alumni Association.  I actually have a draft of the bylaws, a membership dues structure, and people willing to pay money to join.  Like Circle K, we need twenty people, which I don't know if I have or not.  I guess we will find out tomorrow.  Tomorrow, a questionnaire I sent out is due.  I'll assume by who doesn't send it back, that they aren't interested and weed them out.  Friday, I'll mail everyone else a packet with the proposed bylaws, membership application, a proxy voting form, and a whole ton of other stuff.  I'm also on the look out for people interested in running for the charter board officers.  The alumni association is open to Friends and former members of Circle K International who live in the LMT area  in addition to former LMT Circle K'ers.  If you haven't gotten the form and would definately like to be a CHARTER member of the LaMissTenn Circle K Alumni Association, let me know so I can mail you a packet on Friday.  Dues start at $10!!  If you want to serve on the board, you must live in Louisiana, Mississippi, West Tennessee.  Send an e-mail to  urlLink LMTAlumni@yahoo.com  for more info.

      Okay, CBS and everyone else, this has really gone on long enough.  Last night, the Grammys aired on CBS a brief week following the still controversial costume reveal at the Super Bowl.  Justin Timberlake was present and accounted for, with several number of performance appearances throughout the night, not to mention an award speech which included another apology.  Janet Jackson, the ultimate bearer of the infamous pierced breast, was asked to cancel her appearances for the night.  Am I the only one that finds something wrong with this attitude?  Excuse me, but where is Mr. Timberlake's responsibility in all of this.  If my eyes have not deceived me the number of times I have seen this snippet re-aired throughout the week, then it was Mr. Timberlake who did the revealing by pulling the costume off in the first place!  Why is it that he gets off with a slap on the wrist while Janet Jackson gets railed for owning the breast is the first place?    Once again, media has proven what a patriarchal society we live in these days.  That a woman will be ostrasized for what was obviously an embarassing mistake, while the man who tore the clothing from her breast is forgiven with a little tap on the hand, then welcomed back into society.  Clearly, Janet is being punished because she has the breasts!  Breasts, despite giving nourishment to a child at birth, are apparently the ultimate symbol of evil and obscenity.  Whether the woman does the flashing or not, she is ultimately responsible for it because the breast is an attachment to her body.  Does anyone else make a connection between this and the statement that a woman brings on rape because she dresses provocatively?  I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who feels this way either.  If you didn't catch the snide hints from some of the presenters last night, or if you just didn't watch, let me clue you in.  Several times, Patti LaBelle made references to Miss Janet during the Luther Vandross presentation (which was suppose to include Janet).  Christina Aguliera, who thanks to the wonders of double-sided tape somehow managed to stay within the top portion of her dress, even made mention (*giggle**giggle* I don't want what happened to Janet to happen to me. *giggle**giggle*).  The camera, of course, immediately began zooming into her face, just in case.  Hello!  It wasn't as if she was dressed in an ill-fitting top and her breast just happened to slip out a la Stephanie Helmsley.   Justin Timberlake pulled off her costume; he accidentally pulled too much!  Ugh!  The whole entire situation just burns me up!  I wish everyone would get over Janet's pierced boobage and move onto something actually important like public education or saving baby seals... or SOMETHING.  Damn!  Does anyone else every wonder that if everyone put as much effort into public education or something equally meaningful as they do into talking about Janet's breast and George Bushisms that perhaps we might get somewhere in life?  Just a thought...

      Ladies (and Gents, if you are of that persuasion), do you wanna feel glamourous?  I am inviting you to my house for a Mary Kay Glamour party on February 28, 2004, at 6 p.m.  The idea is to get all dressed up then hit the town for a girl's night out at Pat O's!  I'll be sending formal invites out in the next few days, but mark your calendars now!  Please RSVP with your acceptance, or regrets, by February 20, 2004.

      So I was off surfing the web today when I ended up on the Princeton Review website.  I am a curious sort of person, so decided to search Loyola University New Orleans to see what the good ole review had to say.  Now, my freshman year at Loyola, my dorm floor sisters had a goal: to make the Party School list.  Of course, any school in New Orleans is really disqualified to begin with just because of location, so we never really had any luck with that.  Despite this, I'd like to report that Loyola University New Orleans ranked #8 in Schools Were Students (Almost) Never Study.  How true, how true...  LSU did not even make this list, but we do know which lists they placed in (most beer, most hard liquor, and parties).  UNO ranked in the teens for professors who make themselves scarce.  I thought that was the entire campus... hee hee hee!  Anyway, I am happy to know that most of my fellow classmates graduated with the same ill-amounts of study time as I did.  Go Wolfpack!

      Once again, the Super Bowl proved to be a huge disappointment.  While this year's game wasn't too bad (the first half was pretty boring), but all of the extracurriculars that the Super Bowl has become known for really left the viewer lacking.  Here's a brief overview of my opinions:    The All-day Lead-in to the Big Game  Wasn't this just a bit much?  The Nickelodeon thing was just dumb; TRL on CBS... ugh!  Leave the cutting edge stuff to cable, guys!  This was obviously a blatant attempt to rake in more dough via the offspring of the buying powers in America.  Did it work?  I doubt it since most of their attempts were so diluted that even grandparents were forced to change the channel.  The four-hour long Super Bowl documentary was best summed up in the hour-long version on ESPN Classic.  CBS, stick to the game.    The Pre-game Entertainment  This would have been better half-time entertainment than what we were given.  I'm not a country music fan, but Toby Keith was tolerable.  I'd like to have learned the story behind Willie Nelson's guitar with the hole worn through (from too much strumming?).  Maybe H&R Block will cover that in a future commercial.  Josh Groban's performance was excellent.  Yes folks, this would be an example of singers who do not lip-sync because they have actual talent.  Kudos to Beyonce as well; she should just be the permenant national anthem singer for the NFL.  Pulling Aerosmith out from whatever coffin they've been lying in was just more proof that the Super Bowl elite have definitely lost touch with reality.     The Commercials  Once again, the commercials stunk.  By far, the worst award goes to AOL for their American Choppers commericals.  Are there people who still haven't realized that AOL is just a gigantic virus that a person pays to have infect their computer?  I guess not.  Ted took notes on this, so I don't want to steal his thunder.  See  urlLink his   blog for comments regarding this year's Super Bowl Commercials.  The NFL Channel and Budwiser came through in a pinch.  Thank God some people still have a decent sense of humor!    Half-time Entertainment  Watching really bad lip-syncing artists generally is not what I call entertainment.  I really must question if these "artists" have ever sung their own stuff, as many times as they had their mikes by their sides when they were "suppose" to be singing.  The Super Bowl talent scouts also sure have a talent for choosing the latest of cutting edge entertainment, don't they?  It was real nice seeing that Janet still remembered her dance moves from the Rythym Nation era, circa 1992!  (Yes folks, *I* was in junior high when that gem was released!)  It's really bad when I would rather listen to Kid Rock actually "sing" than watch "Hey P. Diddy" and company lip-sync badly.  At least Milli Vanilli did their mimicing with style!  As for the Janet boobie incident: if Ted missed it, than there really shouldn't be that big of a deal.  We all know Ted notices anything regarding nudity and the opposite sex.  This is really reminiscent of the recent Madonna/Britney kiss that wasn't really much to begin with.  Never the less, expect MTV to pay Britney to marry someone else in Vegas in order to get over this latest blunder.  Summary  We are all suckers who keep getting drawn in by all they hype year after year.  Sometimes, I doubt that the networks and the NFL even try to be entertaining anymore.  I guess all we can do is hope for better stuff next year.

      Yesterday, I went to the ER.  I'd been having some trouble breathing since late Saturday night, and called my doctor Monday morning to schedule an appointment.  They advised me to head to the ER.  So huffing and puffing, I drove myself the 15 minutes down Jeff Hwy. to the friendly Ochsner Hospital ER.  My am I still impressed with all their high tech gadgets!  The wait wasn't too bad, even though Ted (who met me there) was convinced that they were waiting for me to pass out before giving me any treatment.  After about may 30 - 45 minutes, I was brought to an exam room.  I must say my overall experience was much better than the one with Trey back in October.  I was seen by a doctor quickly, who was concerned by my lack of resin in the lungs (a usual sign of asthma).  I got to meet a respiratory therapist who was so nice as to stick me twice, because "Oops!" he hit a vein not an artery.  I received a nice breathing treatment from the nebulizer and took my peak flow.  Next, I was carted away for a chest x-ray.  This was fortunately normal.  The doctor decided to order a CAT scan because he was concerned that I may have a pulmonary embolism.  This is where the fun part of the day began.  For those who don't know, in order to perform a CAT scan, the tech must administer a large about of reflective fluid into the veins in a short period of time.  In order to do this, one is required to host a very large IV needle in a vein in their arm.  Unfortunately, on this day, my veins had no desire to cooperate.  After two nurses and four attempts to saddle me up for the procedure, the CAT scan idea was given up for other procedures.  The nuckle of my left index finger, my left wrist, my right wrist, and right forearm thanked them for their trouble. :-)  I was given some predazone, an oral steroid, to help my chest since I was still having problems.  Next, I was taken to ultrasound to have my legs checked for blood clots, since most pulmonary embolisms cause blood clots in the legs.  I've only had a major ultrasound once, when I was pregnant.  It was interesting watching the process, and certainly less painful than the previous encounters with the needles.  When I returned to my room, I had another two breathing treatments waiting for me.  I felt WAY much better after them, and increased my peak flow by 100!  By this time, I was shaking like a strung-out crack whore from the steroids.  Damn the contraindication with Bipolar!  The doctor came back and told me the deal... that he couldn't logically say this was asthma, but since I was reacting well to the asthma meds, I should just follow up with my PCP in two weeks.  He gave me some more Predisone and an albuterol inhaler script to fill and sent me on my way.  Thus ended my four-hour long odyssey in the Ochsner ER.  Today's word for the day is CONTRAINDICATE:  Michelle and I have conversations revolving around this word all the time because it looks so hard to pronouce!  The proper pronunciation is "kn-tr&-'in-d&-"kAt.  The word means: to make (a treatment or procedure) inadvisable.  Now, asking your pharmacist if a medicine is contraindicated for a particular condition, in my case Bipolar, does not mean he or she will give you the answer you need.  It is best to ask your doctor or find a reliable drug manual for information.

      Michael gave me a topic to write about, one he started on his own  urlLink blog .  While he spoke about Gay Marriages and religious leaders, I thought it would be interesting to look at a bit of background.  You would be surprised that most people assume that homosexuality is taboo across the religious board.  In fact, it is not.  I worked for a Baptist church here in NOLA about a year and a half ago.  While I wasn't affiliated with the church (I claim Roman Catholicism at this time), it was very interesting to see how they worked.  This church accepted gay people amongst their ranks, in fact so fierce was this church in the belief that all people should be accepted despite their lifestyle choices, they completely separated from the Southern Baptist Convention.  For those who understand Louisiana and the SBC will know that this was a major thing.  I think there is an important lesson here.  Obviously, there is a moral obligation not to hold prejudice against any other person.  Some also believe there is a moral obligation to discredit homosexuality.  Which one takes precedence?    The Bible is an interesting document to interpret.  We are looking at a largely aural storytelling tradition that traveled by word of mouth for years (think a VERY large and long game of "Telephone") before it was ever documented, particularly the Old Testament.  That a collection of priests were blessed with the awesome sight to write down the proper verbage word for word is insignificant because there is no evidence to back up the claim other than faith.  Furthermore, like the U.S. Constitution, the Bible is a living document, meaning it cannot be interpreted literally, but contextually based upon current conditions.  It's ridiculous to think that several thousand-year-old writings can be applied verbatim to today's lifestyle!    That being said, there is also the issue of historical evidence of the political "tampering" of the documenting of the Bible.  Scribes were easily influenced, not by some divine power, but by the high-ranking officials that sanctioned their purpose.  For this reason, gospels were left out, words were changed, occurrences were altered to attract and convert people from the indigenous religions.  Indigenous religions practiced homosexuality, among other things, so moral lessons regarding homosexuality HAD to be included.  This is fact and it stretches far beyond the bounds of homosexuality.  Religious holidays were planned to coincide with indigenous worship days, as a way to "stamp out" the competition.  This proves that the question of the morality of homosexuality was created, not naturally inferred.  Science and research, of course, were not as advanced then, so it was beyond the scribes and the government leaders to understand that maybe homosexuality was indigenous itself... a natural alteration for some people to have, like brown versus blue eyes, or blond versus brown hair.  We have come a very long way from ancient cultures.  We have the ability to decipher a great number of things using amazing powers of reason, logic, and scientific research.  Slowly throughout the last century, we have been able to overcome humankind's inclination to demoralize the "different.?  The Civil Rights Movement is an excellent example of our success.  The AIDS epidemic has forced humankind to see homosexuality not as abnormal, but as another alternative.  Why hasn't this stretched to our moral minds?  Why is someone with a different chemical make-up not morally valid, while someone with obvious different physical genetic make-up accepted?  There is no reasonable explanation.  So, should homosexuals have the right to marry?  Sure, why not?  Because of the social taboo many homosexuals are forced to live through, most are ostracized by their families.  They are left to be cared for by their partners.  Unfortunately, in our convoluted world of privacy and succession law, this leaves the partner helpless when their loved ones are hospitalized or even if they die.  The avoidable suffering seems immoral in a way.  Furthermore, the fight government is waging just serves to waste more of our tax dollars.  Homosexuals pay taxes and follow reasonable laws just like every other citizen in the United States.  They are allowed to vote.  Why can they not civilly validate their commitment?  Finally, the first amendment of the constitution stresses that the U.S. government should not make into law anything governed by religion.  The morality of homosexuality is purely a religious debate.  Some faiths are accepting; others are not.  Even within a particular sect, there is some fighting (like the Baptist faith).  Ultimately, homosexuals have the right to be gay just as Blacks have the right to be black or Asians have the right to be Asian.  It's that simple!

In other news, I added a few more blogs I think everyone should check out.   Life is pretty boring right now otherwise.  Something controversial needs to happen so we can have a huge blog-wide debate.  Maybe we should wag the dog and make something up.  Yep, I make no sense whatsoever.

My what a little patience and attention can actually accomplish!  I have a request for my computer-saavy friends out there.  Does anyone know Flash??  I need to learn it for career advancement potential.  I would appreciate any directions I could be pointed in.  Other than that, my big news of the day:  my work contract has been extended until the end of the fiscal year, meaning September 30th!  Yeah for me for remaining gainfully employed.  More word on other possibilities if they arise.

      One must wonder about the level of integrity and journalistic skills of a local newspaper when one opens the paper to find an article about an 80-year-old man who strips at the Westbank Cabaret.  One's level of deep disturbance is assured to be raised even more when said article includes pictures of the aforementioned geriatric in a blue speedo.  I have but one question.  What the hell were they thinking?  What editor said, "Hey, that sounds like a great front page feature for the Living section!"  In a city as culturally diverse as ours, with such richness in art, music, architecture, theatre, etc., what made the geriatric (I just like using that word) more newsworthy?  A part of me wonders if this article is an analogy for this city, maybe even this state.  Is our population more concerned with the trashiness (80-year-old strippers) than finer culture (NOMA, CAC, LPO, etc.)?  When was the last time you visited the French Quarter just to look at buildings and take in the "atmosphere" not just the hurricanes?    I admit that I've been pretty guilty of this, which is obscene for a former music major to admit.  I have never visited NOMA or CAC, and it's been a pretty long time since I went to an LPO concert.  These are all things I enjoy doing, but it just seems I have less and less opportunities to do them now.  Is it because all of our worlds have become consumed by instant gratification and the glitter and flash of the fast life?  I don't know.  Maybe its because those culturally enriching activities don't get the attention they deserve when faced off with 80-year-old strippers.  We are becoming consumed by sensationalism!  And people complain about having to hear someone say something they don't like on the radio?  What about this?    Ultimately, it was the Times-Picayune's decision to print that article in the paper.  Overall, I'm not truly offended, and I don't think I'll go worship the devil because I saw some geriatric in a speedo.  For the most part, it was good for a laugh (and a few moments of fake barfing noises).  I guess the whole article ultimately think about how disconnected I've become from all the great things this city has to offer.  The things not in the French Quarter.  I'd like to think I'll attempt to see more of these things.

      I've accomplished plenty in the Blogger world today, but I guess that's not enough to deserve an early trip home today.

I also posted something on my writing site... the first time since September 29!!  Wow, I am really neglecting my creative side.  Anyway, I feel like I've done something today.  Oh yeah, before I forget.  It seems that Ted's smurfy music has mysteriously disappeared from his blog.

      Crawfish were very good, but a few points of advice.  Get there before 5 if you want to park in their lot; otherwise, plan to walk from the McDonald's.  Also, make sure you are there for 5; otherwise, forget getting in for some yummy crawfish.  By the time we left at 6:30, there was quite a line.  Their crawfish are extra spicy and very good, so go enjoy some with a ice cold pitcher (they have Abita Amber on tap!).  Took  urlLink Matt's  quiz.  Here are the results:  Creighton Duke - Born Leader. Hard ass to the end, you are the one who takes charge when things start to look rough. On occasion you have kicked some ass, and done it well. You don't take any crap, which tends to leave you with few friends.        urlLink What Friday the 13th Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I am patiently waiting for 5 p.m. today because the Quarter View promises that tonight Ted, Trey, and I will dine on $0.99/lb boiled crawfish.  Yum.....  For those who are interested, the Quarter View is that little restaurant right past Sav-a-center on Clearview Pkwy.  Most people manage to comment on how extraordinarily full their parking lot always seems to be thanks to their bountiful supply of excellent food.  Crawfish season is the best reason to dine at the Quarter View, because they usually serve boiled crawfish at that insanely cheap price, once or twice per week.  This year, it is Tuesday and Wednesday nights beginning at 5 p.m.  My butt plans to be in the table promptly at 5 p.m. with cocktail sauce in hand.

      Made it back from the land of Elvis and barbecue last night.  This weekend was nothing short of an interesting LMT Circle K experience.  As is usual, everything was chaotic (from the inside prespective).  It made me think about how "together" things look for those who don't participate in the planning and actual execution of an event like District Convention.  The budget for the event was severely cut and registration was unfortunately at an all time high.  It was a little depressing to see our district on such a downside.  The reasons for the downturn are just so numerable and include everything from lack of Kiwanis support to the irregularity of the District Board this year.  The weekend was a little on the bittersweet side.  The alumni meeting went very well, but I think I'll save discussion on that for the brand new  urlLink LMT Alumni blog !  Bobby set up a new blog for us to use in the meantime until Eric Stoltz completes the website.  In other interesting alumni news, the district board created a new award, an outstanding alumnus of the year award in honor of one alumnus who does an outstanding job assisting the district throughout the year.  What was truly cool about this award, it has been named after me!  I can't even begin to express the surprise and appreciation at being presented with that honor on Saturday night.  Of course, the weekend would not be complete without something weird or out of the ordinary.  This weekend was no exception to that rule.  Our "caravan" was just past Hammond on I-55 when we passed the "Relay for Christ."  Now, do not interpret this as an attempt to use the Lord's name in vain.  You see, walking beside the interstate was a man dragging a wheeled replica of the cross that Jesus beared.  To say that the sight was a bit shocking (and yes, entertaining to our sick senses of humor), is an understatement.   What is worse, we weren't the only ones to see this spectacle.  In fact, it was the talk of the weekend from most people who traveled  on I-55 past Hammond.  Some LSU students even saw two different people (one on I-12 and one on I-55)!  A word advice however, do not mention the "Relay for Christ" in Jackson, MS.  They will kick you out of the Wendy's.  My sleep-deprived body is glad to be back in Metairie.  This week, Ted will be working on mid-terms, so I'll be busy keeping up with Trey and catching up on housework.  This Saturday, my mom is coming to town to celebrate her birthday, which is in two days.  If anyone is interested in an afternoon/early evening trip to the French Quarter (including Pat O's), please let me know!  I am also hosting a beginner's Creative Memories home show on Sunday, May 21st.  Michelle will teaching everyone all about scrapbooking!  Please let me know if you are interested in attending that as well.

      I was reading  urlLink this article  on  urlLink CNN.com  today when it just hit me that this entire first amendment debate has gone so far, it has become ridiculous.  Straight from the text, the first amendment reads,  "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."   Of particular interest is the very first portion of this amendment, "congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."  I find this an odd conflict with the entire concept of the creation and regulation of law and order within a society.  Laws don't create themselves.  They aren't just born of some sweat-filled dream, nor are they the inspiration that comes over a tall Cafe Mocha in an obscure coffee shop.  No, laws are birthed from the moral beliefs of the society.  Morals and morality are interesting creatures I think.  Morals can be taught, forced, brain-washed, engrained, or even inferred from everywhere.  Very rarely, if ever, do two people share exactly the same morals... kind of like chromosomes, fingerprints, DNA, or something like that.  But where do morals come from exactly, and how do we learn them?  The first logical answer I arrive at is... RELIGION.  But wait, "congress shall make no law respecting an establish of religion," so that can't possibly be right.  Well, what else is there?  Did morals come before religion?  This sounds like the eternal debate of the chicken and the egg.   Regardless, I think we can see a definitive line drawn between two types of people with this country.  The first believes they have the right to communicate with the world in a manner that they wish, despite the appropriateness or offensiveness of the content.  The other sect equally believes that they have the right to NOT be subjected to the first sects beliefs.  This second sect believes that it is the government's responsibility to protect us from the first sect.  The first sect believes the government should just stay out of it, per the first amendment.  I find it a little scary that so many people believe that it is the government's responsibility to protect us from our own lower degrees of "morality".  Since when do I need the government to protect me or my child from curse words and flashing breasts?  Shouldn't I have enough sense to look away or turn a deaf ear?  It continually eats at me that "moral" and "religious" parents are turning to the government to assume their responsibilities.  If you are offended by something, or if you want to protect your child from something, turn it off!  Example: my father did not like cursing when I was growing up, so he never let me watch any movies with curse words in them.  If we started watching a movie and cursing was in it, he would turn the movie off.  It didn't matter that I heard the words at school or elsewhere... when I was in his presence, that was how it was because he was making a conscious decision to personally censor what I heard.  He did not depend on the government.  Now the woman in the article spoke of something unavoidable, something that was accidentally glanced at by her child.  In these cases, it is a parent's responsibility, not the government, to explain the situation and emphasize the moral lesson the parent subscribes to.  If the child is upset, good.  This serves as reinforcement for your lesson.  I'm truly scared because a bulk of America's citizens are freely handing over more and more power to the government.  More people want the government to regulate this and that, and less people care to even vote.  By the trends, I am afraid that we are heading for totalitarianism!  Sure, a flashed breast or a dumb shock jock seem pretty insignificant.  In truth, at this point they really are.  But if the citizens of this nation continue to hand over the reigns of their self-control to the hands of our government, we will have no choice but to revert.

      Normally, I delete these e-mails I get from my dad, but this one was kind of sarcastically funny:   In the beginning God covered the earth with broccoli, cauliflower, and spinach, green, yellow, and red vegetables of all kinds; so Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.  Then using God's bountiful gifts, Satan created Ben and Jerry's and Krispy Kreme. And Satan said, "You want hot fudge with that?" And Man said, "Yes!" and Woman said, "I'll have another with sprinkles." And lo they gained 10 pounds.  And God created the healthful yogurt that Woman might keep the figure that Man found so fair. And Satan brought forth white flour from the wheat, and sugar from the cane, and combined them. And Woman went from size 2 to size 10.  So God said, "Try my fresh green salad." And Satan presented crumbled Bleu Cheese dressing and garlic toast on the side. And Man and Woman unfastened their belts following the repast.  God then said, "I have sent you heart healthy vegetables and olive oil in which to cook them." And Satan brought forth deep fried coconut shrimp, butter dipped lobster  chunks and chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own platter. And Man's cholesterol went through the roof.  God then brought forth running shoes so that his Children might lose those extra pounds. And Satan came forth with a cable TV with remote control so Man would not have to toil changing the channels. And man and woman laughed and cried before the flickering light and started wearing stretch jogging suits.  Then God brought forth the potato, naturally low in fat and brimming with potassium and good nutrition. Then Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fried them in animal fats and added copious quantities of salt. And Man put on more pounds.  God then gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and still satisfy his appetite. And Satan created McDonald's and the 99-cent double cheeseburger. Then Lucifer said, "You want fries with that?" and Man replied, "Yes! And super size' em!" And Satan said, "It is good." And Man went into cardiac arrest.  God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery. And Satan created HMOs. Amen

      Howdy folks!  Well, I'm coming back from a good flashback weekend.  Saturday night, Ted and I got to meet up with our friends Emilie and Russ, who we haven't seen in almost four years!  My how the years fly!  The couple is of course looking great.  It was so wonderful being able to catch up with them over burgers and Monsoons at PofC and cocktails at Pat O's.  We were also joined by Bobby and Ali, Danielle Schroeder, Mark Schroeder (who I've also not seen in ages it seems), Ali's sister Christine and her fiance Mason.  Ted and I plan to stop by Emilie and Russ' for a brief visit on our way back from Memphis this weekend.  I've never been to Starkville, so I'm looking forward to it.    Work has gotten suddenly busy.  Seems that the "new guy" hasn't been doing his job, so now I've got to step in and get it done for him.  This means putting in lots of typing time, and boy do my flying fingers ache!  I finished THREE books this morning (aren't I awesome?)and I have THREE more I want to complete by the end of the week.  These are online books while the "new guy" is working on physical books.  On top of the online books I am completing, I must format the physical books because "new guy" despite having two degrees in engineering and what have you, cannot figure out how to make a section break or copy and paste a table from Excel in Word.    Now, please keep in mind that "new guy" has known about this deadline since he was hired for his job in October.  These books are due at the end of this month.  One would think he would have used these past few months to do his job, researching processes and making changes, instead of waiting to the last  minute.  Its not like our department has the option to just not complete what is due March 31st.   Did I  mention he was fired from another position with the company during a mass company RIF in September?  From the stories I've heard, this guy has a track record of never doing anything while on the job.  I've witnessed the Yahoo! crosswords, DVD player buying, and flower researching.  "New guy" has even fallen asleep, in front of others" while I was training someone at one of the sites!  I've also heard reports that he use to fall asleep at his desk upstairs.  Welcome to government employment!    Sure, I take breaks now and again at work, but I also get work accomplished.  I am a mighty fast worker, so I must pace myself by doing other things like writing on my blog or reading the daily serials at  urlLink eHarlequin.com ; otherwise, I'd look unbusy.  All my years as a cashier has taught me to never look "unbusy."  I think what bothers me about this situation is how "new guy" got his job.  Ardney, the person who had the position, left for Florida leaving the position open.  Well, because I was a subcontractor (not an internal employee), I was not allowed to apply for the position until after it was released externally.  Three days before that time, the RIF occurred and suddenly every laid off jerk wanted the position.  Because they had enough applicants, my department was not required to interview external applicants.  Sorry for me.  It just really pisses me off that now I am having to do his work!  Grrr...  Well, we are having a tornado drill, so I must run.  Later!

      In honor of the one week countdown until Memphis (and the fact that I have one PowerPoint completed), I decided to find a most appropriate quiz.  Alright, so I was bored at work and didn't feel like doing anything...  I scored a  52%  on the "How Memphis Are You?" Quizie!  urlLink What about you?

      I was reading  urlLink Bobby's Blog  today, where he lamented on McDonald's announcement that it would be downsizing its menu by no longer offering the "super-size" option.  I have to say that I am not the least bit surprised by this move.  Burger King and Wendy's are already ahead of the game by offering alternatives to the traditional fry and a cola options in the meal deals.  The way low-carb dieting has been catching fire across the country, McDonald's is poised to make a varietal coup among the dieting masses.  As Ted the Seasoned McD's former employee said to me this morning, McDonald's usually doesn't scale back their menu unless they are planning to offer something new.  Personally, I don't believe in low-carb dieting; its a fad that will hopefully go away soon.  From my personal experience, it only leads to an eventual stomach virus.  I've "attempted" to do the Atkins thing and each time have gotten the "runs" within the first two weeks.  Same thing happened to Ted.  Sure, I lost weight, but I felt denied because I couldn't even eat the veggies I enjoy (I LOVE CARROTS!).  For me, the stomach problems and the restriction were too much for me and Binge City quickly insued.  Sionara Dr. Atkins.  Another reason I hate low-carb diets: it doesn't make any sense.  Veggies, fiber, and other complex carbs are essential to our diet and should never be eradicated (fiber = happy colon).  These types of carbs provide immediate reacting, long-burning fuel for our bodies to function.  Simple carbs, like sugar, white potatoes, and refined flour products, break down quickly causing spikes in blood sugar levels leading a person to feel really energetic, then extermely drained in a short period of time.  These are the carbs we usually overindulge in, not the others.  Currently, I am working to reduce (not eradicate) my simple carb intake, while increasing my complex carb AND protein intake.  This must also be coupled with portion control, low-fat preparation, and exercise (for calorie burn) for effectiveness.  I'm attempting more of a lifestyle change than anything else.    I  think it's vitally important for our mental health to not restrict anything from a diet.  I believe restricting food translates to starvation in a dieter's mind.  We have a tendency to fixate on what we can't have to the point that we binge.  As a "diet" is not something one goes on, but a lifetime eating style, I think it is important to train ourselves to properly treat ourselves to sugars and candy without the worry of overindulgence.  It's also important to train ourselves to separate our emotions from the food we favor for our overindulgence.  This is what I am working on right now.  I have learned to identify when I feel stressed, I crave chocolate.  Having that knowledge, I've been able to refocus my outlet from food to some other endeavor.  We shall see how successful this method will be.

      Well, I wanted to talk about the Oscars, but it seems that two days after the fact, it's lost whatever thunder it may have had.  Honestly, it was pretty boring, so I guess that's why I can't think of any funny commentary to share on the event.  I will say that the Mary Kay party was a huge success on Saturday.  Everyone enjoyed the primping and quite a few people bought whole new makeup looks (me included), so be sure to whistle and make nice comments next time you see Ashley, Michelle, Beth, my mother-in-law or myself.    Circle K District Convention is quickly approaching and I find myself hip-deep in the planning of the event along with Becca and others.  I've been working on the PowerPoint presentations, which I must say will look phenomenal :-)  I'm also working on a Saturday morning session: scrapbooking!  We'll be scrapbooking alumni and district pictures for a district scrapbook, which I hope will be kept up after this year.  I purchased a scrapbook, photo mounts, paper, and lots of stickers yesterday from my friends at Michaels.  I'll probably peruse the clearance aisles at Target for some more stuff later today.  One thing Becca and I have not had much luck with is karaoke.  Supposedly, one can download mp3+g files from KaZaa and play them from a computer like a karaoke.  We haven't witnessed proof of this yet, despite hours of downloading last night.  Does anyone know how to do this?  Please let me know!

      Ted and I went to see "The Passion of Christ" on Friday afternoon.  Since even before its release, this film has been making news because of its reported "anti-Semitic" atmosphere and "ultra-violent" depiction of the crucifixion of Christ.  Always one who is easily attracted by controversial hype, I could not wait to see the film, because I was sure it would be an intense viewing experience.  I was not proved wrong.    Is this film violent?  Well, yeah.  What does everyone think, that scourging and crucifixion was pretty?  I went into the film expecting a realistic display of the violence which coincided with what I happened to know of that period.  I received exactly what I expected.  Was it hard to take?  Yes, at times it was difficult; however, I believe it was meant to be so.  The viewer is simply taken from the theatre and tossed into the throng of people surrounding Jesus as he is beaten and sent to his death.  One feels every lash as if it were his or her own, as it should be.  Jesus said that he died so we are forgiven of our sin.  How accurate and amazing that Mel Gibson has allowed us the opportunity to share in that sacrifice.    Now, was the film anti-Semitic?  I do not think so.  Yes, the Jewish people were extremely critical of Jesus.  His teachings were new and threatening to their status quo.  The responses of the masses are typical if you think about it.  Not everyone has the courage to change, to go against the grain of popular society.  We see that even today.  Does this mean that the Jewish society today should be punished?  Absolutely not!  Jews today are no more culpable for the mistakes of their ancestors than I personally was for the concentration camps during WWII.  I was not alive during WWII, so I could not control those horrible actions.  Not one member of the Jewish faith was alive during Jesus' life; therefore, they should not be punished.  I think one of the final scenes of this film is overlooked in all of the anti-Semitic debate.  After Jesus dies, the temple begins to crumble under the force of a great earthquake.  This, of course, was foretold by Christ, and laughed at by the Pharisees.  One can see the beginnings of regret in the eyes of some of the Pharisees in this scene, as if they realize that they have made a mistake.  The scene is important because Gibson shows that the Jews of that time were capable for remorse for their actions.  The scene certainly communicates that they were not entirely barbaric.    Overall, this is certainly a film to see if you can handle the violent realism.  I think it makes the passion story more meaningful for the viewer.  Gibson himself is a strict traditional Catholic (he follows pre-Vatican II doctrine); however, I think this film would be good for a viewer of any faith as just a means of a historical view of one of the greatest faith stories of modern times.

      Back from H-town.  Boy, what a weekend!  I went to stay in Pearland at Shanda's friend Heather's house.  It was very nice.  All I have to say is Pearland has some nice places that are way cheaper than some of the crap houses we have around New Orleans.  I guess you could equate Pearland with the Northshore... but cheaper per square foot.  Anyway, we girls treated ourselves to some manis and pedis before heading out past astroworld (yes Matt, I said hello for you) for some Mexican (and oddly enough, I've had better here in town).  Later, we returned to Pearland to dress for a night out... and yes, the obligatory stripper.  We won't go there.  I'll just say I've never laughed harder.  We finally set out for downtown Houston at midnight (yes, I felt like I was back at LSU again).  From my experience, I've decided that our fine NOPD have a real organized handle on all night time activities in the French Quarter.  Downtown Houston was nothing short of mass chaos!  We never even found a parking spot, so our drive in was for nothing, but we were all tired anyway.  This week, I am looking forward to National Scrapbook Day at Michelle's mom's house, from 10a - 5p.  The event is $25, and if you are interested or want more info, contact  urlLink Michelle  or visit her Creative Memories  urlLink site .

      Well, MSN knows why.  According to  urlLink MSN's The Most (and Least) Stressful Cities study , New Orleans, Louisiana, ranks number three in the nation for most stressful city.  We beat, of all places, New York City AND Las Vegas.  Who's got the top two spots?  Tacoma, Washingtom and Miami, Florida.  A company called Sperling compiled what they called the "Sperling Stress Index" comprised of factors like unemployment rate, divorce rate, commute time (HA!), crime rates, suicide rate,  alcohol consumption (HA HA!), "poor mental health", and number of cloudy days.  As you can see, New Orleans was naturally screwed by our idiot slow state leadership, Mardi Gras, and Earl K. Long ;-)  In other news, I am off to Houston today to party it up Texan style.  Plans for tonight include a lingerie shower, dinner out, then a night out on the town.  I'm looking forward to seeing Shanda again because it has been quite awhile!

      The state of today's advertising has me a little worried.  This is particularly true with radio advertising.  Now, I realize that advertising is all about getting attention, but I am deeply disturbed by this latest commercial from the snack vendor, Lance.  Their latest tag line: "I've got Lance in my pants."  Have you heard this troubling commercial?  Have you gotten the overwhelmingly grotesque images I have, or is that just a product of my twisted BP mind?  For those who haven't had the pleasure (or torture) imagine party-type music (Britney Spears or something) with everyone singing "I've got Lance in my pants."  It's like a group snack orgy or something.  It's been bothering me, so I just thought I would find out if it was bothering anyone else as well.

      From a press release received over the Loyola Alumni newsgroup:   The Board of Trustees at Loyola University New Orleans elected the Rev. Kevin Wildes, S.J., as the university's 16th president effective July 1, 2004. Wildes, 49, replaces the Rev. William J. Byron, S.J., who has served as interim president since October 7, 2003.  Wildes, an expert in medical ethics, has extensive teaching and research experience having taught at Loyola College, University of Houston, Georgetown University Medical Center, and Georgetown University.  Wildes is associate dean of Georgetown College at Georgetown University and is an associate professor in the Department of Philosophy of Georgetown University. He holds a secondary appointment as assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine. He is also a senior research scholar at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics and the Center for Clinical Bioethics at Georgetown.  Wildes entered the Society of Jesus in 1976 and was ordained a priest in 1986. He holds advanced degrees in theology from the Weston School of Theology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in philosophy from Fordham University and Rice University. He received a doctorate from Rice University in 1993; and his dissertation was on the foundations of bioethics. He serves as associate editor of the Journal of Medicine and Philosophy, as associate editor of the Philosophy and Medicine book series, and as co-editor of the Clinical Medical Ethics book series and the book series Philosophical Studies in Contemporary Culture. He was a founding editor of the Journal of Christian Bioethics.  Wildes is the author Moral Acquaintances: Methodology in Bioethics. He is also of the editor or co-editor of four books: Birth, Suffering, and Death: Catholic Perspectives at the Edges of life; Critical Care and Critical Choices: Catholic Perspectives on Allocating Resources in Intensive Care Medicine; Choosing Life: A Dialogue on Evangelium Vitae;  and Infertility: A Crossroad of Faith, Medicine, and Technology. Additionally, he has delivered a number of invited lectures and papers and has written widely on bioethics and public policy.  Wildes takes over the leadership of a thriving liberal arts and sciences institution consistently ranked among the top regional colleges and universities in the South and one of the top 60 in the United States, according to annual survey in the U.S. News & World Report.  Academic excellence, ideal size, rich Jesuit tradition, it's this unique combination that distinguishes Loyola University New Orleans from other institutions. Loyola was chartered in 1912 and is one of 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States. The university serves approximately 5,900 undergraduate and graduate students and offers 60  undergraduate degree programs, 15 graduate programs, and a juris doctor degree. The university is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Visit Loyola University New Orleans on the World Wide Web at  urlLink www.loyno.edu    It's about damn time!  Maybe now Loyola can get some things rolling again.  This new president takes over a university that has survived on foundation funds for far too long.  I spoke with the Director of Purchasing (my old boss) just last week, who confirmed this.  The university's finance department is a mess.  The director of Student Affairs may be leaving as well.  This will be a prime opportunity for some change within the university.  Hopefully, this will include the firing of one evil biatch Rhonda, VP of Business and Finance.  "Gonna wash that witch right outta my hair.."  Anyway, I was impressed with the new president's bio and I hope he can produce for this university.

      Ugh, I hate Mondays.  The weekends lure me into sacrificing my regular schedule for late nights and even later wake-up times in the morning.  Monday always comes as a shock to my system, because all I want to do is sleep and I can't.  Damn but it sucks to have work!  Today will probably be particularly rough because I didn't go to sleep until close to 2 a.m. this morning.  Granted, yesterday evening (or should I say earlier this morning?) I was gladly sacrificing my sleep time for the intriguing conversations Matt, Becca, Tommy and I were having.  Today as I stare at my computer screen, I just wish for a little nap time.  I guess this will teach me a lesson.  Well, wrestling was last night and from the yells and screams I heard from the living room (Ashley and I were scrapbooking in the kitchen), I think this month's PPV was a winner.  In other news, I seem to have adopted Michelle's talent for speedy scrapbook pages: I did six pages in three hours last night!  I'm beginning my work on a scrapbook for Trey's First Year, and I am very anxious to get to the "FUN" pictures, like his first birthday party, so I'm being a speed demon when it comes to layouts, etc.  I am already looking forward to the "Terrible Twos" album, particularly after Trey's stint in "Toilet Bathing" last night.  Yes, you read that right folks: Toilet Bathing.  For those who missed out on the action last night, my son got into the downstairs half bath last night while I was cropping and Ted was watching wrestling.  Turns out, he decided to get into the toilet bodily and bathe fully clothed.  Yes, the toilet had been flushed.  Yes, it was pretty damn funny, and of course I have pictures to embarass him with for the rest of his life.  Ahh... the joys of parenting continue.  In non-related news, the HR director of my contractor wants to hire me as a permenant addition to the company.  This is way cool!  Unfortunately, he doesn't know how to accomplish this as they are sort of "in a hiring freeze" thanks to their contractor, Uncle Sam.  I'm pretty confident that things will pull through.  The HR director is pretty influential; I haven't seen him get turned down for anything yet.   After all, my contract has been renewed FOUR times when pretty much most other subcontractors are going elsewhere.  I've more than proved my value as an addition to this team, so the need for a permenant position exists.  Ultimately, there is time; my latest contract doesn't end until September 30th.  This company is a place to hang my hat and call home, a perfect beginning to a career, not just a job.  I hope this opportunity pulls through.  I am very excited because I will be going to Houston this weekend for a bachelorette party.  My very good friend Shanda Caves is getting married May 15th in Baton Rouge.  Currently, she resides outside of Dallas, where she is an elementary school teacher.  I'm overjoyed about this weekend because I haven't seen Shanda in quite some time.  It will be quite a kick going out and celebrating in Houston as well.  I can't wait!

       urlLink Michael  and  urlLink Pete  started an interesting topic for the season.  Of course,  urlLink Eric Stoltz  has chimed in as well.  I have been working on this for a few days, but I think I have come up with something I can be proud of.  I am very interested in hearing what my other friends feel on these different issues, so please comment away!  Abortion:  After reading the other blogs, I am surprised no one mentioned that the government provides 1) health clinics that hand out free birth control (both condom and the pill); 2) an aggressive ad campaign aimed at the audiences mentioned (impoverished women and teens); 3)WIC voucher system to provide basic essentials for the health of at-risk women, infants, and children in poverty.  None of this is working to control the amount of "unwanted" pregnancies.  If the argument is abortion is for helping children born into poverty or a situation where they are "unwanted," adoption and half-way houses should be pushed as a more feasible alternative to abortion.  Provide a safe place for the woman to convalesce and receive quality prenatal care, then find adoptive parents for the child.  Ultimately, abortion should not be illegal, because it is the woman's right to choose how to handle her body, her guilt, her morals, and her choices.  This does not make abortion any less amoral; however, to make abortion illegal could open the door for desperate women to perform desperate acts such as those done in the early decades of last century (refer to the film   If These Walls Could Talk  ).  This does not mean abortion cannot carry a social stigma, which for many would prevent them from considering this alternative.  Abortion should only be socially acceptable and supported as an alternative for victims of sexual trauma (carrying a child would be too mentally stressful for such an individual, and leads to a much higher risk of suicide and severe  depression) and women at-risk of health related problems (in certain circumstances where mother and unborn child are both at great risk to death).  The human fetus is a living being from about four days old (when the developing heart begins to beat and the developing brain begins to function), so it is certainly a false claim to believe that a child is not living until they are conceived.  Facts like these should be stressed via education to impress upon our youth the idea of abortion as an unqualified alternative to adoption.  As for children born into poverty, government could probably do a better job of protecting the rights of children in our society.  Ideas include advertising foster parenting, particularly amongst willing parents who are unable to conceive, and removing children from households that are unsafe.  Families who are on welfare should submit to regular "inspections" of housing and childcare (I think is already done).  Childcare vouchers should be provided so parents can find jobs or training for a job, (this is already done).  Finally, welfare should be provided with birth control provisions.  Government provides birth control free of charge.  If a child is conceived despite this, the child should be given up for adoption.  No, not all low-income families are bad; however, I believe "good" parents would only bring into the world as many children as they could afford to parent effectively.  Any more would be selfish.  Just my view though.  Health Care:  I actually debated this topic in high school; it was the national debate topic for 1994.  National healthcare is just not a feasible solution for the United States for a variety of reasons.  The most basic argument: we have many more citizens to care for than Canada.  Bigger country = bigger amounts of money to spend to cover everyone's health costs.  Next, we are a nation that does not believe in preventative care.  Consequently, are healthcare costs have risen to cover the large amounts of emergency care that could have been avoided if only everyone went to see their doctor for regular physicals.  Most people have been raised on the ideology that "if it ain't broke, then don't fix it," but this concept just doesn't work in the health field.  Medicine can identify, treat, and cure many diseases before they present any major symptoms, so just because you "feel" fine does not mean you are fine.    From there, we are quite a litigious lot, which also factors into rising health care costs.  Doctors must carry malpractice insurance in order to protect themselves from the possible malpractice suits of their patients.  Guess who absorbs this cost?  Clue: it is not the doctor, per se.  Do doctors make mistakes?  Sure, they are human, even if they somehow made it through medical school :-).  Perhaps, limitations of malpractice suits and the sum of its rewards would improve this area; however, based on the status quo, this creates a limitation to national healthcare.  Also, our drug costs are considerably higher than Canada.  For the millions who have no drug coverage this is awful, but there are reasons.  Our drugs are highly regulated by the FDA, which requires many tests and focus groups before a drug can be marketed.  The FDA also protects us from many harmful or unnecessary additives in the meds they regulate.  Of course, this comes at a price.  Guess who absorbs the cost of all the testing and high quality material?  Again a clue: it is not the drug companies.  Sure, the uninsured can purchase most prescriptions from Canada over the internet, but lately there have been tons of warnings about the contents of these meds.  I cannot argue that this is not money well spent.  I would rather take good drugs that work well, than fair drugs that may have an unknown effect.  Another thing to note, Canada and much of Europe is actually benefiting for the drug research we pay for through high insurance and drug costs.  Of course, with the US footing the bill, these countries can easily afford national healthcare.  That being said, I DO wish our government would give particular attention to the state of mental health coverage within this nation.  After the Reagan administration cut funding for mental health facilities, our nation's homeless rate jumped drastically.  It is essentially unsafe for us to ignore the mentally ill; however, the psychopharmacopia contains some of the most expensive drugs available.  The mentally ill have difficulty finding and keeping employment, and thus quality health care.  With insurance, inpatient care is time-limited, so one can imagine the quality of care for an uninsured individual.  Because of the costs, most of the nation's mentally ill are non-med compliant, which can potentially lead to dangerous situations, like murder.  Most of the nation's homeless are people who could benefit from mental care.  Yes, research in this area is quite expensive; however, with the proper government subsidies so many could benefit from an improvement in their quality of life.  How can the government take action?  I have no clue, and am afraid that again the idea is not feasible.  *SIGH* Here is to hoping!  Gun Control: The right to bear arms is a constitutional right. One cannot argue with that.  In addition, guns do not kill people.  A person must force an action in order to attain the reaction of a gun firing, which creates the product of death.  This is basic logic.  Until we can diffuse the condition by which humans feel they need to murder other humans, humankind will find whatever means to perform the act of killing.  If not by gun, other means will be used.  Decency Laws:   Yes, there is a point when individuals just need to stop handing their freedoms over to the government; however, that still does not mean that anyone has the right to do anything whenever they want.  That is not what the First Amendment says at all.  Read the first amendment.  It states that government does not have the right to make into law any religious belief that interferes with others rights to free speech, free press, or freedom to assemble peacefully.  It does not say anyone has the freedom to say whatever she wants whenever she wants without regard for others.  Freedom of Speech is a delicate situation because it is hard to find that line between free expression of a belief and outright disregard for other individuals.  All the ratings and warning labels on CDs, television, movies and video games are a good thing that is working.  These make parents aware of the content of what they are about to watch or listen to, and from there allows them the opportunity to do their parental duty and chose whether the content is appropriate for their children.  Like  urlLink Pete  said, this is a difficult concept for radio because there is no visual element there to notify people of content.  In this case, the radio DJ is really has to take some responsibility to insure that their shows are just shy of being indecent; however, who decides what is indecent?  I think many individuals are being overly sensitive to decency currently, which has results in many people losing their jobs.  The FCC needs to remember the democratic policy of ruling on the opinion of the WHOLE of society, not just the vocal advocates.  Stem Cell Research:   Problem here is the possibility for harvesting babies for the sole purpose of this type of research, which negates the lessons I spoke of under abortions above.  Stem Cells can be easily attained from the placenta and umbilical cord after-birth of any delivering mother (again, it is thrown away, but the image is MUCH less disturbing).  Parents are encouraged to store their baby's stem cells cryogenically as a means for fighting future disorders, but more than enough is available to share with science too!  Cloning:   We shouldn't be trying to clone the body, but the DNA and cell structure of a human being in order to repair the "bad coding" that predispositions individuals for illnesses of all kinds.  Get that down, then we'll talk about body parts (for replacing un-repairable damage?).  Lauren Anderson, friend and med student, can tell you all about this subject.  I hope that she will comment if she has the time. :-)  Tobacco:   Banning it will not stop it from being used, not to mention, it will not ever, EVER happen.  Tax it heavily and use the income for education.  Make it illegal in eating establishments, but not bars (who do not serve food at all).  If you are real concern is people's health, the sheer cost will cut down most people's habits, but the diehards will still be puffing away.    Marijuana:  This is the same concept as smoking.  Use tax money for education.  Damn right someone should benefit from another's vice!  Other drugs:  I am a little worried about the legalization of some of these drugs.  These can be addictive and attitude/life changing, much like many of the controlled addictive prescription substances (stimulants, benzodiazepines, painkillers).  This would be difficult to regulate realistically.  Legal drinking age:  I think a lower drinking age would only work if the community at large were willing to promote education on how to drink responsibly.  Parenting has been too shoddy for most lately, so I do not know if I would trust the public with this type of freedom.  Seems like a nice idea, but I doubt it would work in real life.  Legal gambling age:  I could care less about gambling.  Tax it so some good can come from the stupidity of others.  Welfare: Time limits are good, but government needs to provide reliable childcare while parents receive training or work.  Mandatory BIRTH CONTROL with adoption penalty if a child is conceived.  Regular inspections of home life to insure the welfare of children, and more foster parenting if children need to be removed from bad situations.

      I know I promised some thrilling argumentative writing to some; however, I haven't quite finished my thoughts yet.  In the meantime, I have some updates for my readership.  Visit my family's new  urlLink website   It isn't much right now, but I hope to work on it in the next few months as I learn new skills.  For you technical geeks out there: I used Dreamweaver MX, and I can now say that FrontPage bites the big one in comparison.  For you scrappers out there, there is a scrapbooking place in Da Parish... Chalmette nonetheless.  They actually carry the line of stickers I LOVE (Me and My Big Ideas).  Here's the info on the store for you ladies in the area (ahem Alison and Ashley).  SCRAPBOOK CREATIONS in CHALMETTE, LA  70043.  Phone is (504) 277-5084.  Eventually, I'll get around to formally changing Eric Stoltz to his  urlLink new  site as well as adding the family  urlLink website  to the list.  Until then...

      I was reading my news on Yahoo!, the Oddly Enough section for a change, and stumbled onto this story that has my eyeballs hurting just thinking about it!  Apparently, the latest fashionable craze in Amsterdam is  urlLink eye peircing .  Yep, as in jewelry inserted into the white part of your eye (conjunctiva for ye who like medical terminology).  This has got to be the absolutely most disgusting thing I've heard of since the Prince Albert and its female rendition.  As a contact wearer, I cannot begin to fathom how uncomfortable this must feel.  Think about it... How much does it irritate your eye when you get an eyelash or a speck of dust caught up in there?  And these people want to put a peice of specially engineered metal into their eye?  And crack and heroin is legal in Amsterdam too!  Look at this thing:     YUCK!

      Back in my high school days, I was into listening to heavy metal music: Guns N' Roses, Seattle Grunge, Def Leppard, etc.  If anyone remembers the time (think 1995), GNR had this pretty popular release called Use Your Illusion I and II, with such eternal video and song hits as Don't Cry and November Rain.  The videos "Don't Cry," "November Rain," were like mini-movies, with the storyline based on a short story written by Axl Rose's friend Del James, editor of RIP Magazine.  Sometime between the making of November Rain and the filming of the video for the song "Estranged," Axl Rose and then girlfriend (and star of Don't Cry and November Rain) Stephanie Seymour, broke up.  GNR was unable to complete the saga that would explain away the story seen in it's previous two videos.    The short story, "Without You," would be printed with a collection of fourteen other similar stories in a small paperback titles " The Language of Fear," in 1995.  Being intrigued by the plot of the videos, and a semi-vulnerable teen willing to buy into the profit mongering I guess, I purchased the paperback for $3 in a novel "Super Wal-mart" (which WAS a new concept then) in Ruston, Louisiana (I had just finished a weekend tri-state honor band at Louisiana Tech).  "Without You" was the fifteenth story in the novel, and I cheated by skipping to it first because I just couldn't wait.  The story was of a self-destructive rocker (i.e. -- Axl Rose) and his relationship with his girlfriend (AKA: Stephanie Seymour from the videos).  I remember the story being completely gripping as the author unfurled these two people and their battle against fame, drugs, alcohol, and their own personal demons.  It wasn't light reading and at several times it was particularly gruesome.  For those who have always wanted to know, the rocker kills his estranged girlfriend and then himself in a murder-suicide aided by alcohol, drugs, and god knows what kind of mental demons.  So why the hell am I sharing this with you?  Ok, so I purchased the GNR Greatest Hits CD a couple of weeks ago and started thinking about the short story.  I have a tendency to re-read things that I enjoy, so I thought about reading the short stories again.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen the paperback I purchased in years, so I thought about seeing what the fetching price for it was online.  HA!  This paperback, which remember only cost me $3, now has a price tag of over $200!  The cheapest I found was in fair condition for the bargain of $45.  Amazing!  So, lost somewhere in my collection of books (or God knows where at this point) is a collection of short stories worth lots of money.  *SIGH*  I would be willing to purchase any of his other works, but James has never authored another work or works of fiction.

      The Quarter View Restaurant is on my SHIT list right now.  Sure, they have really yummy, cheap boiled crawfish on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but is it really worth all the hassles?  Since our last visit, they have now imposed this new policy where "your ENTIRE party must be present" to be seated.  Okay, I can understand this.  There has literally been mobs of people waiting to get into the restaurant each Tuesday and Wednesday night, so the need for a little crowd control seems reasonable because of the sheer smallness of the restaurant.  That's about where my understanding ceased last night.  It was rather early, 5 p.m., and the crowd was hinting at forming.  About half the restaurant was filled with a few groups hanging around outside waiting for the remainder of their groups.  I had Trey, and wanting to feed him prior to eating crawfish, I asked nicely if I could be seated despite their "policy" because of my young child.  Seeing as they had all these tables free, I didn't see where this would be a problem.  Instead, I was told "no" that it was against their policy and that I could feed my child at the bar.  Yep, I should feed my two-year-old at the bar.  Maybe after that I'll go let him play some Video Poker...  So began our restaurant experience.  Our server was a crack addict.  He brought us ten pounds of crawfish and told us it was twenty.  He also refilled EVERYONE's drinks two and three times... except Becca's.  We had to ask for that.  We had to ask about five times for napkins, as did the table next to us.  We won't even talk about ketchup, cocktail sauce, and boiled potatoes.  Needless to say, the service sucked royally!  Everyone that works there is either rude, stupid, or doped up on something (except for the nice lady at the bar where I ordered Trey's meal at... damn them!).  Yeah, I know... I'm generalizing and placing a value-judgement on my experience...  I DON'T CARE!  For Christ's sake, how can they expect six people to eat crawfish without a discard tray??  Dumbasses...  So anyway, I formally withdraw my suggestion for anyone to frequent this establishment for their boiled crawfish dining.  Crabby Jack's on Jefferson Highway has much better crawfish at $1.50/lb., so try them instead.

      If you want ridiculously cheap boiled crawfish, e-mail me before 3:30 p.m., Tuesday, then be at the Quarter View Restaurant on Clearview Pkwy by 6-ish.  I'll be getting the table at 5 p.m., so no wait!  Also, JEM is now on DVD!!  WOOHOO!!!

      Well, now that I can type with fairly good clarity, I thought it would be an excellent time to post on my blog.  I am still alive and breathing a fairly larger chunk of oxygen than I was one week ago.  I've also stopped taking those nasty orange Prednisone pills which caused me so much problems last week that I had to work from home all week!  I'd go so far as saying the sun is shining and this day is great, but that's a bit too much.    We traveled to Baton Rouge this past weekend for a pre-Easter celebration with my mother and grandmother.  Ted, Trey and I also visited with Paul and Michelle while we were in town.  I'd say the weekend was pretty productive, because Michelle and I got a chance to QUIETLY work on our scrapbooks while Ted and Paul played XBOX (not quite so quietly).  I've finally completed the layout of the wedding scrapbook, so now I'm ready to journal and then display.  Next on the table is Trey's baby album and a special album I am working on.  For those who ordered items at the scrapbooking party last month, your stuff has arrived.  I'll be contacting you to make arrangements this evening.

      I have fell in love with Blogger all over again.  I can't even begin to express how cool all these new features are.  Okay, I admit, I am easily impressed.  Anyone who has ridden in my car and heard me espouse on the swivel module of my a/c can attest to this, but still this "new and improved" Blogger is still pretty cool.  You can now create profiles, complete with pictures, which appear on your blog (but only IF you use one of their templates or figure out their code).  Also, new and improved templates that are actually cool looking!!  Commenting has been added too.  What's the funniest feature?  Visit  urlLink Ted's  blog and view his entire profile.  You can search for other people who like the same things that you do!  As you can see, Ted likes sex.  Go ahead, click on it.  The outcomes are quite entertaining, especially the naked chick in chains...

      Because gas is $12 DOLLARS a GALLON!!  At that rate, wouldn't you demand legalized drugs as well?  DAMN!!  I'm a member of scrapbooking.about.com's forum, which sends out a pretty interesting newsletter once a week.  One of the members is planning a page layout with a map indicating all the gas and milk prices around the country.  Well, a few international people chimed into the debate, including this one scrapper from Norway.  $12!  My gas tank holds roughly 14 gals, so you realize it would cost me hmm...$168 to fill my tank in Norway!  Anyway, in other news: if you are bored, female (or a male who enjoys wearing make-up), and have an hour to spare around 3 p.m. today, drop by my apartment for a Mary Kay basics face care class.  No pressure, just some girly fun.  Afterwards, you are welcome to stay over for some cropping.

      This Monday almost seems like the beginning of something new for me.  Last week, marked the end of an era, and what a busy week it was!  I spent the first four days in the Mosquito Capital of the World (Brazoria County, Texas) on a work related trip.  As a Louisiana resident, particularly one who grew up in the middle of a marsh, I've seen my fair share of mosquitoes of unusual size, but nothing compares to the mosquitoes of Texas.  I guess the statement is true, Texas DOES like to do things bigger!  These suckers looked like the cartoon mosquitoes, complete with rainbow bodies and pointy needle noses... all the better for bleeding poor suckers like us dry.  Ugh!  Hertz Rental Car Company is now on my shit list.  We managed to go through 4 rental cars in just only 2.5 days of our trip.  Before we even drove off the lot with our first car, we were told it was the wrong car and were upgraded to the evil Buick Rendezvous.  I hate the Buick Rendezvous.  I hate Buick.  Before the end of our trip, we would see two of these monsters in as many days -- they suck!!  Home sweet home I returned to on Thursday night, not that it was relaxing.  I grocery and party supply shopped Thursday night after my flight back.  Friday was more shopping, some cleaning, and Ted's graduation (YEAH!).  Saturday was spent prepping, cooking, liquor shopping (HELL YEAH!), and partying.  Sunday was catch-up day.  Finally, things have slowed to a normal pace and I feel I have the time to catch my breath.  I am thinking of joining Curves in July.  Curves is a women's only exercise facility offering a thirty minute workout and optional weight loss diet.  The facility I plan to join is located in Elmwood on Citrus.  Curves uses a circuit training approach to fitness training and offers double positive strength training machines coupled with cardiovascular exercises and specific warm-up and cool down stretching.  As I mentioned earlier, the entire workout lasts just thirty minutes.  Would anyone else be interested in joining along with me?  Costs include a one-time initiation fee of $149, and a monthly fee of $30, which is drafted out of your checking account.  If you are interested, please let me know.  I'm interested in finding some exercise partners!

      As I work on a third set of invites this month, I think to myself: Is there any such thing as an Independent Invitation Creator?  Think about it?  I'm making these invites all the time.  Rick needed some extra invites for his graduation, so I whipped up some twenty extras for that.  Ted and Rick will be having and graduation party, so of course invites went out for that as well.  Now, I am sitting here dreading the fact that I have to send out invites for a Mary Kay party I am hosting on May 29th.  I'm invite creation-burned out!!  Thank God for evite!    Tomorrow night marks Rick's graduation from Delgado.  He will official have his Associates degree in Criminal Justice, so don't get caught breaking any laws (or if you do, give him a call, I hear he has connections...) :-)  Saturday, my good friend Shanda will finally be wedding her long time boyfriend in an outdoors wedding in Baton Rouge.  Everyone PLEASE pray that it stays dry so she has the wedding of her dreams.  That night, Ted (hopefully) and I will be attending the F.U.N. party at Paul and Michelle's home.  Things are definitely looking up from here.  I'm too exhausted to write about what's happening about in the Middle East these days other than to say has anyone else noticed that the Middle-Eastern Americans are taking over the New Orleans area convenience store market (AKA Discount Zone).  This is about all I can say, as my next door neighbors are probably Al Queda members, are definitely very scary looking, and regularly beat their kids.  Yep, I'm tired.

      For those who are fortunate enough not to work in the wonderful Elmwood/Harahan/River Ridge/New Orleans/Jefferson area (AKA: zip code 70123), you really missed what one could only call a "gully washer" yesterday.  Like the rains of Noah's time, the sky's opened up and poured for what only seemed to be a mere hour or so, but the ramifications were far more startling.  Let's begin with the journey home.  I usually leave work at 4 p.m. everyday and Monday afternoon was to be no different.  As I walked out the door, about twenty people were huddled about the doorway, apparently avoiding the dreaded rain soaking walk to the car, or so I thought until I step outside.  The roadway leading out from the office building on all sides was under water.  Most assuredly, this meant that Clearview was knee deep by this time.  Needless to say, it took thirty minutes of careful navigation to get from my office building to Jefferson Hwy., which had turned into a rushing waterway and occasional parking lot.  Large clumps of mud floated by me as I followed in the wake of the tall SUVs, which I figured was my best option.  An hour later, I finally made what was usually a ten minute trip to pick up Trey.  Thirty minutes later I was home.  This leads me to my next question, why would the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles need a battle sub to battle Shredder.  So far, I've seen the commercial twice and each time I just cock my head to the side and say, "huh?"  I guess many of you have seen this look on your dog at one time or another.  Anyway, aren't turtles amphibians?  Ahh... Corporate America!!  An update on a past post, Frank Davis has Lance in HIS pants! :-)

      Go ahead... get the singing out of your system... I'll wait.   Yes people, I have something important to say, which effects all you wrestling viewing fans out there.  Ted and I  WILL NOT  be hosting the PPV this month.  I have a wedding to attend, then another meeting to attend, Ted has work, etc., etc.  I think you get the point.  Ted and I will reconvene PPV hosting again in June.   Wow!  Look at all these changes to Blogger!  If you haven't signed on in awhile, come and check it out.  Blogger finally added SPELL CHECK!  Oh, I am so excited.  Now, I don't have to copy and paste my posts to Microsoft Word anymore.  There is also a nifty shortcut for previewing your post.  Cool deal!  This weekend was pretty cool.  Ted finished his FINAL final ( YEAH ) on Saturday!  I completed an entire scrapbook in less than a week's time.  We went to a Zephyrs game with Tommy and Becca for the most awesome ticket price of NOTHING.  The seats were cool too.  As Tommy said, "the umpire can hear us from here!"  Mother's Day was relaxing thanks to Ted, which was just what I wanted.

      Wow!  I've been slacking around here lately.  One might think was actually participating in finals like so many others I know.  This semester, this is not the case, but unfortunately I will be joining your ranks again soon, so I will not gloat much longer.  Ted is working on his last major final... THE final.  It's due Monday.  Most of you know Ted well enough to understand the type of stress he is projecting on the rest of the household.  Take pity on me and my situation.... okay, anyway.  Last weekend was fun.  I got five scrapbook pages done, which was a lot for me considering I was also keeping Trey from destroying Mrs. Damaris' house Saturday.  I had lots of help from Mrs. Damaris, Katie and Paul on that end.  Afterwards, Trey got to stay the night with Mamere while Mommy and Daddy went and ate with friends at Bennigan's.  Ted ordered what I have named a "heart attack on a plate."  The menu called it the Monte Cristo.  I gained 15 lbs. watching him eat it, but he swears it was worth it.  I am happy for him.  Attention ladies in my area, I intend on scrapbooking on Saturday.  If you would like to join me, please let  urlLink me  know ASAP.  LATER!

      It's official.  David accepted a position upstairs leaving the other fulltime position in my department open once again.  The available position was posted in TP Sunday in the Professional and Computer sections of the paper, not interally, and not via Monster.com, so they aren't really searching too hard for a new candidate.  I guess that's in my favor.  I will be sending in all the required paperwork today: resume, salary history and requirements, and writing examples.  I believe the recruiter is in my corner, and I know the lead in my department is on my side.  I guess we will all see how things go from here.  Everyone keep me in your thoughts.  Hopefully everything will go well and I will be a full time employee soon!

      It's only 10:20 a.m. and I can already say today is a strange day.  This can't be good.  So, I woke up this morning like any other morning.  The television was playing the hair club commercial again for the second day in a row despite Ted cancelling his scheduled episode of The West Wing from the night before.  Waking up to the Hair Club infomercial (by the way, it is official The Hair Club, not the Hair Club for Men, because like so many other things, the Hair Club is an equal opportunity hair provider), is not one of my favorite things to do in the morning, so I can contribute that to my laziness in addition to my lingering pneumonia.  Anyway, I finally got up sometime after 6:30 to get dressed for work, watching Sally Ann and crew as normal.  Seems that the Hip Hop Symposium, or something, is in town today.  Reverend Run (i.e. -- Run of Run D.M.C.) is one of it's promoters, speaking of anti-violence among black youth, etc., etc.  His new white caps look very nice.  Their message spoke of improved education and *gasp* an educated and registered voting African-American populace.  They'll be out at the Oakwood Mall later today, which proves the point that Oakwood is turning into a ghetto mall.  Now for the truly strange and grotesque.  This is not for the faint of heart or stomach.  You have been forwarned.  The elevator at work has been out of order all week.  Today the repairman arrived to repair the elevator, but unfortunately he was doomed to not leave.  I'm not too sure what happened, as many others aren't as well.  While the repairman was on top of the elevator fixing the elevator, it began to move upwards toward the third floor.  The repairman became trapped between the uppermost portion of the elevator shaft and the elevator car itself, effectively crushing him.  Yes people, as I type to you there is a dead person in the lobby of my building, not even to far from my office.  This leaves me feeling strange... uncomfortable in my own skin.    I guess we see death after the fact... in the funerals of loved ones.  We also see death on television.  People speculate that this makes us numb to death.  Lately, we have been seeing all kinds of death through war.  Yet, nothing truly prepares us for death in the real sense of experience.  This was something that happened just paces away from me.  This is real.

      Does anyone remember the infamous Stephen King novel turned television miniseries from the mid-ninties titled "The Stand"?  The premise of the story, long and excessively drawn out as King is want to do, is a biological/chemical warfare weapon engineered by the U.S. goes radically wrong and basically "escapes" the high tech labs where it is being experimented with, spreading this "super flu" across the U.S., killing off everyone.  Good stuff, but I just could never get past the fact that King desperately needs an editor in one of the worst kinds of ways.  Didn't watch the miniseries because of too little t.v. and too much extracurriculars.  Needless to say, I have no clue what the outcome of the novel OR the miniseries was.  The point I am trying to make deals with my own events as of late.  It seems as if I keep getting ill out of nowhere.  I swear I am fine.  I work in a fairly large enclosed cublicle area.  I have my own computer and phone, which no one touches except for me.  I rarely visit any shared office equipment.  Sure, my son is like a germ's delight.  He is after all a two-year-old boy who attends day care, but even he stays healthier that I do!  Nope, I get the neon green mucus,stay up all night coughing fits, super flu with a side of the bloody nose for dessert.  Is it f-ing allergies?  If so, then why won't Claritin do it's jo?  I've loaded myself up on all sorts of goodies to no avail.  I'm still feeling retched.    Where does this crap come from?  Ted likes to blame it on the cat, but why am I not allergic to the cat for the other 364 days of the year?  There has to be a test or something for that.  I went out of town last week.  It always seems to happen at those times.  I wonder why... was there mold?  I definitely know I am allergic to that, and with all the rain there has been lots of that!  I also cleaned and kicked up lots of dust, another allergen for me.  Maybe that made me the way I am right now?  Ugh!!  I am just so pissed cause I feel like crap and nothing I takes will help.

      Federal holidays rock, but unfortunately I don't get to take advantage of many of them.  I was glad that my company was essentially directed by President Bush to close its doors in honor of President Reagan.  The ceremony was beautiful, of course, and Nancy's final goodbye to her beloved husband was poignant.  Did anyone else get the chance to see Clinton's nap session during the funeral?  How disrespectful!  Then again, why I am I not surprised by this former president's behavior.  In other more local news, he has risen from the ashes of his failed gubernatorial campaign, folks.  In case you have not seen or noticed, Jindal is running for U.S. 1st District Congress, a seat formerly heald by David Vitter, who will be running for Senate this term.  This is good.  If Jindal wins, which I strongly hope he does, he will gain the experience he needs to come back and beat the biatch Blanco in 2008.  Personally, I would compare this new campaign to a pheonix, which mythically rises forth from its own ashes to begin anew.  One thing I am still trying to get... when did Jindal move to the area?  District 1 represents St. Tammany, Washington, Jefferson, Orleans, Tangipahoa, and St. Charles.  Last I heard, Jindal lived in Baton Rouge....

      Eric asked the question, "What kind of employer do you work for that would want to know what your favorites were?" on another blog recently.  Now, the questions wasn't aimed at me particularly, but I felt I had to put my two cents in because I work for the government, the employer who must know all.  You see, we have a department of employees who's sole job is to sit and watch internet activity all day long.  Sounds like loads of fun, huh?  Yeah, I thought so....  Anyway, the government wants to know every single little thing every one of their employees does.  From the moment I enter the parking lot, I am monitored by very high tech, digital cameras.  These inconspicuous cameras are scattered about the site, probably in the bathrooms watching me wipe my ass for all I know.  So there,  THAT'S the kind of employer that wants to know what a person has on their IE favorites.  Another fine examples of tax dollars hard at work.     Ladies, I desperately need your help.  My friend and MK consultant Tilly is offering this awesome special this month only.  If anyone books a Mary Kay color party in June, the hostess gets a color kit ( a $63 value-- 3 eyeshadows, a blush, and a lipstick) for the price of whatever date she hosts the party on.  I want to hold my party on Saturday night, June 12th, but I need 4 faces there to get my color kit!  You don't have to purchase anything (unless you fall in love with the Mary Kay product), just come and try.  If you are interested, you can book your own parties from there.  Please let me know ASAP if you are interested... I may even move the date to a weeknight sooner if that is more feasible for people out there so let me know VERY SOON so I can call Tilly.

      In less than two hours, my fate just might be drawn.  I've been tasked with giving a presentation to the HR director of the company for which I am subcontracted.  He is a pretty laid back sort of guy, so overall I am not too worried about the presentation.  I know the material, and on the off chance that I develop stage fright (which I have never ever had in the 15 years of performance experience), I've built in a handy dandy cheat sheet into my Powerpoint presentation.  Powerpoint is awesome.  It is interesting why I am even doing this presentation in the first place, because what I am presenting is the solely the job of another employee in the department.  Even stranger is the phone conversation I had with an STC(strange acronyms to protect the not so innocent)literally a moment before I received the request to perform this presentation.  The STC had mention a conversation he had with the HR director about me taking a permanent position with the company, particularly taking this other employee's position as he would be moving on.  So folks, cross your fingers that I impress the HR director today with my witty presentation prowress and win myself an indispensable permanent position with this company soon!

      I now fully realize why they call it "house hunting."  One certainly must "hunt" for that extra special place to invest in.  I for one am frustrated with the whole ordeal and just want to get it over with.  I've never been one to have much patience in the first place, but buying a home is something I've been waiting on for quite awhile as it is.    For Ted and I, it's looking more and more like we will be taking the plunge across the lake (YIKES!) and moving to Covington.  What knowledge we have of real estate and finance tells us this would be a good decision for us.  When comparing the market, an 1800 sq ft house we found (brand new) in Covington is selling for $125,000 (about $77/sq. ft.).  Comparable to that, we could settle for a 20 year old, 1250 sq. ft. Metairie home in need some level of improvements for the same amount of $125,000 (about $100/sq. ft.).  On top of the monthly expenses for the house, we would also need to furnish liquid funds for basic improvements, like paint, for the Metairie home; whereas, the Covington home will be customized to our liking.  Even with the added driving expenses, we still come out saving money in the long run because we run less of a risk of losing equity in our house.  It's all very frustrating.  In one case, we don't want to commute so far.  Yet, Ted and I really would like to get the most out of our money since this is such a large purchase, not to mention commitment.  We've been waiting FOREVER to make it even this far.  I guess we shall see where we end up.  Who knows... maybe a Paul and Michelle deal will fall in our lap ;-)

      Ted and I are selling our sofa to make room for a BRAND new one (YEAH!!).&nbsp; I thought I would toss out a picture and see if anyone was interested in it before I attempted to sell it anywhere else.  &nbsp;       Of course, the sleeping toddler is not included. We'd like to test drive him for a few more years. :-) If Michelle decides to try her hand at garage sales again on Friday, we may try to truck it up to Baton Rouge, so let us know ASAP if you are interested.

       Today's word for the day is:   cavitate  , which means    to form cavities or make bubbles, i.e. to make an unfilled space within a mass,  especially  a hollowed out space .&nbsp;  Now that we all know what    cavitate   means, I think we all deserve to take a nice relaxing   DAY OFF !   &nbsp;  Am I enjoying this new and improved, once again, blogger design or what.&nbsp; No more coding for me!&nbsp; All of joys of web life are preprogrammed for my occular enjoyment.&nbsp; YEAH!&nbsp; Anyway, for those who haven't heard, I've been working with the Metairie Dawnbusters, who&nbsp;will be sponsoring a Young Professionals Kiwanis Club in Division 4B (Eastbank).&nbsp;   We are planning to hold an informational meeting at Metairie Manor&nbsp;on August 3, at 7:00 p.m.&nbsp;   District club builders Dr. Jay and Fred Dumas, and Dawnbusters representative Sal Cali will be some of the Kiwanians present at the meeting.&nbsp; We'll be discussing all kinds of fun info, so be sure to mark that date.&nbsp; For directions and info, send me an  urlLink e-mail .    This weekend, Ted and I are headed to Baton Rouge to deliver a birthday gift to my brother (yeah, for cleaning out the house and gifting at the same time).&nbsp; My mom purchased a computer we had hanging around the house for my brother and a wireless internet set-up, so we are going to get everything put together over there.&nbsp; Tomorrow morning, bright and early, I'm helping Michelle with her garage sale.&nbsp; Hopefully, we'll make a little change too, since we have an old daybed up for sale.

      I am sure this is just the beginning of what will probably be many more entries on the same subject, house hunting.  Ted and I are scheduled to set out on our first date with a realtor this evening.  This is of course, post-last weekend's drive about La Place where we explored the wonders of the small community's numberous country clubs (and one ghetto).  The town has lots to offer: small town living, Frostop (mmmm...), more house for less money...  Ted and I are pretty anxious to put our hats into the ring of first time home ownership.  We already have plans in our head.  One of our first projects once we move will be to remodel some of our existing furniture.  Our china cabinet, once owned by my grandmother, will house china no more.  We have decided to give it a fresh new look and an updated task by repainting and refinishing it, adding a few new shelves (and maybe some lighting) inside, and turning it into media storage for our DVDs and VCR tapes.  The big buffet will also get some matching repainting and refinishing, and will become a lovely new entertainment center for our television (size permitting).  We think this will be a great way to make these pieces much more functional (and beautiful).  Enough about homey stuff.  This Sunday is scrapbooking and the "Possibilities with Pens."  FUN! FUN! FUN!  Give me a call if you want to come along.  It starts for two in the afternoon.  Also, I will be ordering the WWE PPV for those interested in watching it; however I will be asking for some money to help defray the cost.  (Ted will probably be working.)  Whatever you can chip in will be appreciated.  I will be making spaghetti with meatballs for dinner.
