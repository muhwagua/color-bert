      When it rains it pours...  (just a short side note before I begin... I think this is the first time i've ever seen that quote used for actual rain.  I am about to do a nice long jibba jabba about rain, when usually that quote is used just for bad circumstances.  I don't have bad circumstances, i just have challenges)  Rain is wonderful!  For the past year or so we've been facing drought possibilities in Pa with only a few sporadic storms throughout the year.  But michigan, MICHIGAN is different!  Michigan has rain quite often.  It really does alot to cheer me up, which is odd, seeing how rainy conditions are supposedly proven to decrease morale or whatever.  (Morale is one of my favorite words)  This morning I was in one of the BEST moods I've ever been in.  I was enjoying myself, even though I had a test and bio and chem.  Choir was cancelled, maybe that had something to do with it.  But yeah, back to the rain.  Not only has it been nice and rainy today, we even have a TORNADO WATCH!  Isn't that GREAT?  It'd be so cool if i was just sittin here doin' my homework and a tornado pulled me out the window or something.  What a great way to die!

      I like squirrels.    I never appreciated them until now, but that's most likely because I didn't get to see them every day.  I didn't realize that such an important animal has been missing from my own backyard for so long!  We need oak trees.  I like to watch the squirrels with their goofy little mannerisms.  Maybe someday I'd like a squirrel as a pet, though i hear they can wreak havoc on a person's home.  I'll just have to give the squirrel its own little squirrely room with no breakables and lots of fake (or maybe real) trees to climb in.  Wouldn't that be fun?  -squirrellover839587201

      Tuesday night I had prelude class, and the speaker was a woman who had performed with  urlLink Second City   for many years.  Being an improvisor myself encouraged me to actually try to stay awake for the presentation, which turned out to be not so difficult.  I enjoyed it very much, and even got to participate and tell the whole room about how I had forgotten my toothbrush for the Youth Group road trip last summer and walked a mile or two down the road w/ Jaron to a gas station that had toothbrushes, only to find that the only color they had was PINK.... blech.  It was a good story tho.  But there was a very upsetting part to this presentation too.  At one point, we were asked to think about an "active moment" in our lives...  something that changed our perceptions forever.  The example she gave was about seeing her father turn away from her mother when she tried to kiss him, and how that showed her that her parents didn't love each other.  When I tried to think back upon my life, I realized that I can't remember any "active moments" in my life.  Now some people would just realize that and say, "Oh well, no problem.  I just have a bad memory."  But to me, it seems more important than that.  Aren't these active moments the things that define us as people and make our lives interesting?  don't they sculpt us into the people we've become?  I believe so, and therefore not being able to remember any of these "active moments" in my life is very disturbing, because I can't remember anything that makes me "me".  I have no real recollections of the past.  I have no foundation for discovering who I am.  Who am I?  who AM i?  I just don't know.

      In case any of you didn't know this already,  urlLink Wint-O-Green Life Savers  are awesome.  Remember to bite them in front of a mirror in a dark room often, becuase it's much fun to see the results.

      But he's been 10 for like 15 years!!!  Does he or bert have a mom there?  I've never seen one.... maybe he's an orphan?  and THAT's why he's clinging so desperately to his ducky.  (which is, in fact, YELLOW, and not orange.)  Maybe one of us should adopt ernie?

      Well DUH!  I know that much Kairsie, but we're talking about for Ernie.  Obviously, Grover is not the one for Ernie, but Ernie seems to believe that his Rubber Ducky is THE one.  What if this isn't true?  I think Ernie needs to expand his boundaries and explore his options.  After all, there ARE other ducks in the pond!

      "I feel officially vindicated in my view that Valentine's Day is worthwhile holiday. I went out last night, and had an absolute blast. :) "    Yeah what Jesse said. You could of gone out and had that much fun any time you wanted. It does not vindicate your views on v-day just because that's the day you went out on and had fun. It could of snowed friday and your plans be postponed till saturday so neeehhhhh! (hehe i'm in a mature mood......and i also have the feeling i won't be experiancing much human contact for awhile :'(  )

      And jon, you said: "I feel officially vindicated in my view that Valentine's Day is worthwhile holiday. I went out last night, and had an absolute blast. :) "  does this mean you don't have fun on any day other than valentine's day?  Why are you restricting your fun to Valentine's day?

      If you girls don't quit your jabbering about fashion and such, ie. "What should I wear to....", I'm going to have to utilize my administrator abilities and start censoring and such.  I can do that y'know, cuz i'm "special."   Also, I don't know if i want to continue to allow Kelly and Rachel to write here if they keep bashing me on their blog!   I tried, I really did, so leave me be!  As for walk-type stuff... I am, as always, in a very confusing place.  But according to the speaker at LOFT last night (aren't you proud of me?  I went to LOFT!) we're destined to ALWAYS be in a confusing place.  Isn't that so dern hopeful?? heh heh.  Something else I realized is that I've always had a thing against allowing myself to be "spiritually rejuvenated" through sporadic religious activities such as LOFT or Creation or any other thing that has group worship time or an altar call because those sorts of things make it all seem fake and short-term.  You get a spiritual high at one, and then a few weeks/months later you realize how crappy you've been doing recently and go to another even for your "God fix."  Because of this philosophy, and the idea that this type of fakeness is bad, I've avoided allowing such things to affect me much.  But I was wondering what it would be like if I went to/ had such events daily, and thus it wasn't such a sporadic thing and it might not just be about the spiritual high.  My worry would be that I would become dependent on them, though, and wouldn't be able to handle missing such things for a week or so.  Comments?

      "on to some more serious matters, what has God been doing in your lives? I feel like I dont get to talk to you guys about that very much! I'm realizing asking how your week was is good, what you did and such, but its also important to ask how the spiritual walk and such is going"    I'm not sure....but i think He's teaching me patience to the point that it's almost rediculous!

      Hmm... you say that I can pull off the pink punk girl look well, and I have blonde hair, are you trying to match me up with Ernie?! I dont know, I mean Bert does have that unibrow going for him :)  And Rachel, the sweater will be far too hot (and no i'm not just wearing the scarf!  Thats very inappropriate).    On to some more serious matters, what has God been doing in your lives?  I feel like I dont get to talk to you guys about that very much!  I'm realizing asking how your week was is good, what you did and such, but its also important to ask how the spiritual walk and such is going  -Kelly

      1.)  I know that the duck's yellow, but Ernie is orange.  On second thought though, I don't think that he needs to confine himself to other orange people.  He'd look good with that pink girl with blonde hair, you know the one, right?  2.)  Is he really ten?  Because he looks older than that.  Also, I don't know about you, but I remember that I liked boys way back in preschool.    3.)I know that I'm not the only one who's wondered what's up with the Bert and Ernie living situation bit.  Are they really just friends?  4.)  Kelly, wear your red pants and black sweater!  -Rachel

        Well i definetly agree that i *prefer* a guy to be taller than me, being skinnier or bigger i don't really care about. But if i was to find a guy who was like perfect who was shorter than me i wouldn't be like "no he's to short"...although now that i think of it all the guys i have liked have been taller than me....and Kelly also pointed out i have a thing for younger boys, which is very odd. ::shrugs:: oh well go figure

      Speaking of liking and dateless-loserdom... We were discussing how girls don't like to date guys shorter or skinnier than they are.  Are guys like that, must date a girl thinner and shorter?  Or do guys just not care?  From our experience they don't seem to care nearly as much.  Any insight?  Kelly

Even I like it, so if a dateless loser (lonely until we die, so unappreciated, why why why?) like me can like it, then you should too!    By the by, I need to say that I'm so glad that Jesse doesn't hate me!  :)  I should get going.  I hope everyone has a happy National Rachel Day!  -Rachel

      Wow, Jon.  I'm impressed.  Huzzah for you with all this pro-Valentine's Day discourse!  If I would have expected an anti-V-day attitude from anyone, I must admit, it would be you.  :)  Just goes to show how people aren't always what they seem.  Just for the record:  I thoroughly enjoy Valentine's Day, but concur that you should demonstrate your love for the amazing people God has placed in your life daily.  Still.... it's fun to do extra-special lovingish things once a year on a special day designed for extra-special lovingish things!  So the official (official as far as I'm concerned, anyway, and that should be official enough for the rest of you--after all, I AM Pineapple Girl, you know!)....what was I saying?  Oh yeah, the official verdict is that Valentine's Day is good.  There you go.  Now don't we all just feel wonderfully warm and fuzzy inside?  Yeah, I thought so.

      "Jesse and Kairsie both hate Valentine's Day, so they could get married and spend every February 14th doing something morbid!"    nope, sorry. As much as i love Jesse and all i'll have to veto that idea. And of corse church on Sundays isn't bad cause your worshipping God who is like a gazillion times more important than some lame holiday.   "Go Jon with his mad match-making abilites... "    If you really have mad match making skills, you know better places where they're needed/wanted than between me and Jesse....and NO not who your thinking off the top of your head.  In conclusion Melody rocks! Cause she quizzed out

      I never post on here. I know.   This whole Valentine's Day thing reminds me of  urlLink Tastyfresh  before they took the "Spiritual" section down. heh. I guess all I can say is that I hope you anti-Valentine's Day people find spouses that share your views, or else you might just have to change your ways. Either that or sleep on the couch once a year. :) Oooo! Ooooo! I just had a great brainstorm! Jesse and Kairsie both hate Valentine's Day, so they could get married and spend every February 14th doing something morbid! I'm, like, a Cupid for the 21st centruy. Go Jon with his mad match-making abilites... heh. Just kidding. Anyways, I do believe that every day you should show your significant other how much you care about them. People's actions will have to speak for themselves in terms of that. However, you should also worship God every day, so is church on Sunday mornings bad? No, of course it's not. That's ridiculous. So what makes it different? Nothing, really.

      This poor genie is going to have a complex! :)  I think it's time for a new subject (and since I think that, everybody should follow suit, of course):  Life is so much more beautiful when it's NOT 5:30AM!!!!  I've been trying to determine over the past few years if I am a night person or a morning person.  Seems like an easy determination, doesn't it?  Well, those of you who know me well know that I'm not so good at the whole 'making-decisions' thing.  You also know that I am an obsessive list-maker. (I make lists of things I've already done, just so I can cross them off and feel productive!  Isn't that sad?) So here's my list:  Reasons Amanda might be a morning person: 1.  IF I get my butt outa bed before 9 am, I don't experience that morning grogginess that I see in a lot of my friends and family. 2.  Once again IF I get up, I do the have the ability to get lots of things done and within that first hour or two, and then I feel mega-productive (go me!) 3.  Even if I try, it's an extremely rare occasion that I would sleep past 9:30 or 10.  Reasons Amanda might be a night person: 1.  I really do come alive at 7pm.  That is, of course, if I didn't get up 2 hours before daylight that morning. 2.  I can be working on a project or reading a book and have no problem working/reading until 4am.  The problem comes when I have to get up early the next morning.  But as for that night...just call me energizer bunny. 3.  If I have to get up early in the morning, it's not a simple "go to bed one hour earlier to get up one hour earlier."  It's more like, "go to bed at least 2 hours earlier to make up that pathetic one hour in the morning when it's dark and dreary and who wants to get up at that time, anyway!!!!"  What is the point of this ranting on and on on Jesse's blog?  Well, the exciting part is that I've finally realized that I am DEFINITELY (spelled with an 'i', not an 'a'...sorry I had to say it) a night person!  So, this morning when I woke up to the sun shining in my window, I realized how beautifully, amazingly wonderful that is!  So.... HOORAY FOR NOT WAKING UP AT 5AM!!!  Here comes the new discussion part:  How about you?  Are you a night owl or an early bird? (And if you're annoyed at me because you've read this whole entry and think it's totally lame and competely rude of me to have taken up so much space...sorry,....kinda)

      Kairsie: "But seriously that's what genie's wear"  oh really?  when's the last time you've MET a genie?  I used to be a genie, and that's DEFINITELY not what I wore.  So how can you say you know, huh?

        ok seriously guys this is obsurd. It's a DOLL! a cartoon! And i personaly see nothing wrong with bikinis. But seriously that's what genie's wear, and it doesn't make her a  "skank girl" And i'm sorry but i'm not that strict on dress apparel. ::shrugs:: i've just never really been convicted of it. there's a time and place where it certainly is not appropriate but a little cartoon on a blog as far as i can see doesn't hurt anyone

      I vote for calling the Genie "Shorty B. Ho," the 3 most common dysphemisms for "woman" in the hip-hop language.   (Now... you may be asking yourself...  urlLink what the freakin' heck  is a dysphemism? Well, look no further my friend. Your search can end  urlLink here . You also may be asking yourself what Shorty's middle name is. You'll just have to figure that out for yourself. This is a PG rated blog.)

      Yeah, but bikinis are gross too.  Maybe you can find a genie that's wearing a nice big sweatshirt or something.  Or at least give skank girl a name so that we don't need to keep calling her "the genie".  -Rachel

      Roger is an excellent name for a plant.  It just rolls off the tongue...."Good morning, Roger!  How are you this morning, Roger?  My, aren't you looking green and lovely today, Roger!"  And when your plant dies (as mine always do- what can I say, I just have a way with foliage), you can just blame it on the name.  "Well, Roger realized that his name was, in fact, Roger, and it pushed him over the edge.  Poor Roger committed plant suicide.  He just couldn't face the reality of his pathetic existence."  Plants appreciate eulogies, by the way.  So, when your plant passes, be sure to give him (or her) a proper eulogy.  It just wouldn't be right if you didn't.  It's not like he could give it himself.  I mean...you can't give a eulogy if you're dead.  Only receive them.  It's a shame, really.

      Kairsie... the colors.... WHY?   can't you just be satisfied with plain old READABLE type?  we dont need a "glow" on all your blogs, yknow ;) .  Quality over Quantity, my dear. (in this case, quantity referring to the number of psycho effects to your text...)  A different color once in a while, sure, that's fine.  But GLOWING?  it's just plain annoying to read!!!  oh well, rant off.  since some of you want to see where that song came from, you can visit it  urlLink HERE   btw, check my site for some pretty pictures!!! tee hee hee...

            To the whole freedom fries thing, America is a freakin moron.  To Ruthie, I think you need to go to Walmart or Toys-R-Us or something and just act up till you get kicked out. Actually I think you should skateboard in a mall till you get kicked out, but I don't know if you have enough time to learn to skateboard :)

      Yeah, but the really great thing about changing the name of French Fries is the fact that they're not from France.  They're called French Fries because of the way they're cut.  Kairsie-You didn't know that cod was fish?  Have you never seen Peter Pan?!!  "Hook is a cod fish!!"  -Rachel

      So about the whole French thing... ( urlLink changing things like French Fries to "Freedom" Fries ). I'm all about some "Freedom" kissing to celebrate. hehe. Just kidding. But if you think about, it's even more retarded than it seems on the surface (doesn't seem possible, given how retarded it first appears). In WWII, when we changed things like sauerkraut to "liberty cabbage," it almost made sense. Germany was "the enemy." (In hindsight, those actions, too, look retarded.) But when you look at this, France is our  ally , in NATO with us, blah blah blah. We're not going to war with France, so why should we rename their products? Freakin' idiots in Congress. My goodness.

      Ok.  Here's the deleted post cliff notes: Jeff-  Feel free to pick on me for posting at 9am and 2 in the afternoon.  Just remember that SOME people (some being me) have to be at work BEFORE 10 am, so SOME people have to go to bed way freakin' disgustingly early in order to wake up before the stinkin' crack of dawn.  Now, I realize that you may be waking up at various stages of the night and early morning recently to take care of that adorable little girl of yours, but also remember that I have no beautiful baby girl to greet me at 5stinkin30 am.  :)  Besides, my 9am post was celebrating the fact that it was Saturday and that I found it quite wonderful to have slept in after a thoroughly enjoyable late night.  Have I ever told you my argument for becoming a seventh-day adventist?  You should ask me sometime.   On another not-so-random note:  Alysen is a night person...er...cat.  She is pounding through the house, attacking everything right now.  This is her nightly routine.  She's insane, which is why I love her.  I'm insane, which is why people love me.  :)  **Sings song from Peter Pan, "I won't grow up, I won't grow up...."**  As for now, it's too late for me to be up.  I need to go to bed.  I'm going to kick myself in the morning.  Hm...kick myself....don't I know someone else who does that? :)

      Yay! I'm joining you, k?  Kairsie, you have entirely too much time on your hands.  Maybe I can send you one of my textbooks to read and you can sumarize it for me, how 'bout it?  I haven't seen any of those movies, or wait, yes I have.  I saw Signs and I thought it was a really good movie but it freaked me out and I wrote home that I wanted a butcher knife and Janelle said she'd sell me a Cutco(sp?) one.  I had chicken for supper and I actually enjoyed it.  Here at Lottie we have chicken, chicken, more chicken, and lots of cod.  You would not believe all the different ways they come up with to make cod.  It's insane.

      Speaking of chicken.... I foolishly made the assumption this morning that "it is day."  I was corrected by my friend Brie.  In fact, the truth is that "it is chicken."  Three movies that I've seen recently and want to know who else has seen it, and your opinions:  1. Signs 2. Catch Me If You Can 3. The Ring  I rate them in the above order.  Movies are so much different when you watch them actively and actually think about them as you watch them!

      *Note: This isn't just my blog, it's your blog too!  I just play the role of editor and censorship chairperson.*  As for me, I've realized I'm DEFINITELY a morning person, and I love it.  Just another thing to set me apart from my peers!  I  can  stay up late for special occasions (such as the new years party and such) but I can't do it very often.  Sometimes I get grumpy and whiney, sometimes a *little* too hyper and mucho annoying.  I love being able to say that my bed time is 9pm, though it's nearly impossible to get to bed that early.  But it IS my goal.  It helps that I can sleep through almost anything.  Often there is yelling and screaming from 10pm to 1am across the hall or in my suitemates' room; I can sleep through it.  I even fell asleep at the rave I went to last week!  Now THAT was an awesome experience!  I want to sleep at raves more often.  My theory is that I've had lots of practice with falling asleep with the TV on and such.  It's one of my talents, eh?  The only thing I  can't  fall asleep to is the sound of balls bouncing.  This drives me utterly nuts, especially since people in my suitemates' room love to bounce basketballs and LaCrosse balls at like 12 midnight.  GRRR... oh well.    In conclusion: Taj = morning person

Levitt, M.D.,'s  studies show that the average person has 13.6 episodes of flatulence a day."  do you think that's true?  umm.... on second thought you don't need to answer me!  i just thought that sounded crazy!  how'd ya like to do a study like that one?  ok, enough on this topic.  i'm gonna get some work done now.

      "You could name it "Bush" but Kairsie might come and dump it out on the sidewalk."   Heck yeah I would! I think you should name your plant Mr Green. That way whenever things go wrong you could blame it on him that he did it in the conservatory with the revolver.      PS the sound affect is really annoying and gross

      Let me know when you got that inkjet make-up thing working.  I'm always looking to save time lost by doing useless things, like applying make up.  I'm mean good grief, why'd our culture ever have to pick up the concept of make-up a couple centuries or whenever it was, and why do only women get stuck with the burden?  It's screwed up if you ask me.

      Shauna, if only you could be as cool as me...  you could name yours Flour Jr. our green plant at ACTV is in an old kitchen "flour" container which has "Flour" in big letters on the front.  Isn't that a cool name for a green plant?   Flour - the famous ACTV plant (that is thirsty as we speak.)  another fun name would be "Leif"  except it would only be funny if he had a name tag... and so you wouldnt have to spell it out for people.  You could name it "Bush" but Kairsie might come and dump it out on the sidewalk.  of course you may not want it to be a boy... since then you might be ashamed to undress in front of him. in which case you may want to name her Rose, Daisey, Blossom, or something of that sort...

      I'm jealous of jaron's pennies... i don't like to pick up pennies i find on the street or ground or whatever, cuz that's kinda gross... eric does though, so he's rich, or something.  Oh, and in chemistry, i do things correctly, so i don't make things blow up.  But i DO like the whole burning magnesium thing... yay for going blind!

So incase you got tired of seeing it not being updated and stopped going, you should go now!    Also, thank you Candi, Jeff, Jamie, and Ruthy!!!!!!  -Rachel  By the by, I had 4 doughnuts today in chem class and could have eaten more, but he didn't  have anymore that I liked.  okay, I need a nap.  bye!

        No, the flee would be ok cause if it got stuck in the watch it could hang out with the "Tick". hahahaha...yes very lame. I made something blow up in chemistry once, it was a little glass jar that held sparking things in it. I had the bunsen burner on to high. And I still got an A....haha go me

        So that day we melted a glas tube in chemistry class.  Of course thats not what was supposed to happen.  But it makes sense since we used a gas burner with a 6 inch long blue flame instead of the tiny micro burner that we were supposed to use.  We like to do things on a larger scale then the book says.  So if it says two drops of hydrochloric acid, which would be safe, we would use maybe ten drops.  Then leave the bottle open sitting on the table next to the flaming burner.  Sometimes we see how dangerous this stuff is.  Thats why we hide under the table when it looks like it's going to blow up.

      If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.   Kairsie- What are you talking about?!!  Doughnuts, chocolate covered pretzels, and chocolate milk rock!  (Although I think that some chocolate covered raisins would have went nicely with it.)  DUDE!  Tomorrow in chemistry class we each get two Dunkin' Doughnuts' doughnuts!  Sweet!  (Literally!)  Hehe, and Jon said no more chocolate for me...  :)

      After you eat ice cream you should drink water.  They taste yummy together.  Plus, as a free gift, the water helps get the sugar off your teeth before they turn yellow!  Wow, I really feel like brushing my teeth now!  -Rachel

Anyone here ever hear of Skizzle Dizzle?  yeah, me neither.  But nate told me he had just gotten in a shipment of it.  He even said his mom already knows!  I'll bet she's in on the whole deal!

      The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I'll put a very large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little piece of meat. And if someone asks me why I didn't get more meat, I'll just say, "Oh, you mean this?" and pull out a big piece of meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I've hidden it. Good magic trick, huh?

        It did not look good for us.  Me and my comrad Danricc were improsoned in the highest tower of the castle.  Several 14 year old girls gaurded the only way out.  Danricc thought for sure he could get out the window, but to what doom he would fall he did not want to find out.  Then by chance an oppurtinity came, and lo!  A great battle arose!  One of them fell the to ground, and I was about to step over her when I was pushed from behind.  A few seconds of shoving passed, and this is what I saw: Krystal was lying on the wooden steps with her head out over the step, and I was being pushed over her.  I tried to hold on, but failed.  I was sent tumbling down the steps head first, and Krystal after me.        Yes, it hurt, but we were free.

      hahahah rachel is scared of potatoes!  *snicker*  I would like you all to know that today I wore the pants and shirt my sister got me for my birthday.  They are very nice and comfy and nice.  Speaking of my bday, I'm 19, and as a 19 year old I have to put away childish things.  Thank you all who were in my birthday video, but you're all so immature *scoff* . pfft.  Ruthy: I remember that rainbow you loved so much, i think thats the one i let my bio book get wet for.  Thanks all for being so active on here!

      Yeah, we grow potatoes in our garden.  Some we store in the garage and some are stored in the basement.  After a while they get those really long things.  I think they look like spider legs.  They scare me when they look like that.  -Rachel  (Please don't make fun of me because I'm scared of potatoes!!)

      yeah, so the other day becky and i found a very unique treasure in our kitchen cabinet.   up on the top shelf, way back in the corner, was a bag of potatoes that was there since, um...., i can't even guess how long.  the "eyes" of the potatoes had turned into long, white and pointy fingers.  no, wait, that description doesn't quite do it justice, they were more like trees!  probably like 10 inches long!! becky thought it was gross. i thought it was pretty cool.

      I would correct Ruth for her inaccurate statement, but I'm shunning her. Shun.   However, if I were in a conversation with, say, Danricc, I might say something like:  "Can you believe that Ruth girl?" And Danricc might say something like "Yeah, I know. She eats all my freakin' cheese. I mean, it's bad enough that she steals my clothes and things like that, but I can live with that. But chesse? I mean,  cheese ??!!??! It's just not right!" And I might say something like, "I know, Danricc. I'm here to comfort you in your time of great lack-of-chesse. If you ever need cheese, I will drive you to WaWa and we can buy cheese. As far as that cheese-stealing surrender monkey Ruth, we should shun her." Shun.

      Oh, and the only question I saw posted by Kairsie is, "Aren't Rainbows Fun?"  That question really feels more like a statement disguised as a question, or perhaps a rhetorical question, so I didn't bother answering.

        Things everyone should know.....or not.  A cockroach will live nine days without its head before it starves to death  Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.  (Do not try this at home .. maybe at work)   The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off.  ("Honey, I'm home. What the....")   Butterflies taste with their feet.  (Something I always wanted to know)   Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people do.  (If you're ambidextrous, do you split the difference?)   Elephants are the only animal that cannot jump.  (OK, so that would be a good thing....)   A cat's urine glows under a blacklight.  (I wonder who was paid to figure that out.)   An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.  (I know some people like that.)   Starfish have no brains.  (I know some people like that too.)   Polar bears are left-handed.  (Who knew...? Who cares! )        I just realized that Jon's post below states that I should be kicked. Well screw you hippie.      Are  n't   Rai  nbo  ws F  un?

      Just so that I may be counted among the highly literate...  I, she, he, and they are always to be used as  subjects . Me, her, him, and them are always to be used as  objects . They would be considered predicate pronouns. The first-person pronoun (I, me) always comes  last  in the order.  To illustrate:  She and I are eating pizza.  correct  They are eating pizza.  Her and I are eating pizza.  incorrect  I and she are eating pizza.  incorrect  I and her are eating pizza.  So bad that you should be kicked if you say it.  Me and her are eating pizza.  See above.  Them are eating pizza.  See above. Repeat, because this one is really flagrant.   They looked at him and me.  correct  They looked at he and I.  incorrect  They looked at he and me.  incorrect  They looked at I and him.  Practice this phrase with me: Would you like fries with that?   Make sense? I hope so. Of course, most of the participants in this discussion are Berks County natives, so it's going to be a long, uphill battle.

        Jeff, only if you live long enough to explain it...and make sure you study cave man-ish before you go back, perhaps have some carvings on a stone ready.  How come no one answered my questions I posted a few days ago?!?!?!   "Her and me" just sounds bad. I always say me and her, which is probably incorrect anyways but oh well.

      I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.

      Kelly, you aren't from the South Side, you live on the EAST side of knollcrest... haven't we been over this already??  And rachel, I believe that saying "her and I" cuz it would be "she and I."  Like in, "she and I became best of friends" or "She and I picked flowers all day long" or "She and I moshed til we dropped."  Using "her and me" would be correct if you were saying something like, "They threw water balloons and her and me..." i think.

      I used to be a daffodil.  I had to stop because I was prettier than all my friends, and they stopped being nice to me cuz they got jealous.  They were hogging all the water from the water basin and I started to wilt.  It was like I was crying on the inside.  Then a bird came and pooped on one of my petals, and all my friends laughed at me, but they weren't intimidated by my overwhelming beauty because it was defiled by the poop.  They shared water, and I stopped crying.  But you know what the best part is??  I think the poop actually makes me more unique, and in my uniqueosity I am STILL a whole lot prettier than my friends.  -Sheltenruggy (the daffodil!)

         So I got up to eat breakfast. I stood in the line for a few hours, and finally got my plate of food.  There was a pile of white fluffy stuff on it.  I began to eat it, but realized it was mashed potatos, and I HATE potatos.  In my anger I stabbed it with my fork only to find out that there was a piece of meat inside!!!!!!!!!! (GASP!)      It was all just a dream.  Actually it wasn't even a dream I just made that up now.  Do you like i WHAT THE FREAKIN HECK WAS THAT NOISE!!!!!!!!!!?????????  I gotta go.

If a man makes a comment, and no woman is around to hear him, is he still wrong?  Why did God make some animals have live babies, and some have eggs?  Why do mash potatoes taste so much better than regular potatoes?  Why is pop-corn not a vegitable?  Do you say tomatoe or tomaatoe?  What exactly is raining cats and dogs? Like a down poor or hurricane type conditions or what?  What is the highest number you know of?

      Speaking of secular music...  I'm a big fan of Christian music. At least, the good Christian music. Anything that has a positive outlook on life is most likely going to be better for you than say, Slipknot. (Who suck, by the way.)  But also for the record, I listened to Siamese Dream by The Smashing Pumpkins today, and can I just say, dag! I forgot how much they rocked. It's always interesting to observe the type of music that you gravitate towards depending what type of mood youre in or what type of week youre having. For example: Jon is in a pissy mood, Jon listens to Smashing Pumpkins. And Jon feels somehow better. It's cathartic somehow, in an odd way.   Speaking of odd things, why does talking in third person makes you feel more objective?

      "and for the record... a big fat diet of secular music can kill you and your faith"   Well I believe that to be a matter of personal opinion and conviction. I've gone lenghty amounts of time not listening to secular music (ie cornerstone, the road trip) and I didn't see a difference due to the music.

      I think a good product would be "Baby Duck Hat". It's a fake baby duck, which you strap on top of your head. Then you go swimming underwater until you find a mommy duck and her babies, and you join them. Then, all of a sudden, you stand up out of the water and roar like Godzilla. Man, those ducks really take off! Also, Baby Duck Hat is good for parties.

      bad news guys.  I don't know if you know yet, but I'll say it anyway.  Evenescence is not Christian.  "What the (blank) are we [our CD] doing in Christian stores??!!" said one of the members.

Rachel, you *KNOW* that you ment for the spating up blood and Jon's chicken were to go hand in hand. Stop trying to be sly. And I don't know if it was the chicken anyways.

That makes me very sad on account of the fact that the neat little trick my mommy taught me to remember how many days are in a month with my hand is flawed.  My mom will be devastated!  Knuckle=31 days... space= 30 days (except for february, which has 42!)  Jaron:  when was the last time you founding yourself spating up anything?  You lose becky horning!  April IS the best month!  Bio majors born in april will rule the world someday!  At least we'll have all the diamonds, cuz after all, they are our birthstone ;) .    Rachel is a fluke. Isn't that class cestoda?  I guess that's better than class turbellaria (planarians!)... once again i reiterate: bio majors will take over the world!

      So, Rachel, if spating up blood was from something other then Jon's chicken then why say not to vote for him right after saying you spat up blood.  Obvioulsy you didn't like it, or it had some kind of connection.  You cannot tell other people to vote or not vote for us.  It depends on their personal opinions.  And lastly I have to say that what ever month Jon was born in and June, of which I was born, are the two best months.  That is unless Jon was born in June also.

You may have pointed out the fact that the chicken was probably pre-cooked if you really thought it wasn't your fault though...feeling a little guilt, are we?  And, I think it was a fluke...I don't think it was allergies.

        "Becky Horning does not belong in the month of May." That makes it sound like you think we should kill her April 30th and then bring her back to life June 1st (no I didn't forget the "r" today Jon drilled it in our heads that it's incorrect to have the "r").

And Ruth, poo poo on you for telling me how I can or cannot cook when I rock. Original material, my crew, non-stop.    (Just to clarify, no one got sick from the chicken. Rachel has allergies. The chicken was bangin. Best snack ZMYG ever had. Cause Jaron and I are the man. Collectively.)  Why does AOL give 1,000 hours free away for a month? It doesn't make any sense. Can someone answer me that question? Thank you.

      Sometimes it's hard to tell if something is actually a memory, or you just dreamed it. So I asked my boss if I called him a lying, stinking thief, or I just dreamed it, and he said I just dreamed it. Whew, that was close.    *I got a new email address today.  Neither of my hotmail accounts would let me write mail.  My new one's with yahoo, so we'll see if it's hotmail or if it's my computer.  You can email me at rdherber@yahoo.com*  -Rachel

      You know what would be really cool?  If you could just click a button and change the wallpaper of an entire room like you can change the background on your desktop.  Whenever you get tired of the motif, presto!  A brand new room!  You could choose from art or photography or cartoons!  That would totally rock.  I wonder if we'll have something like that 30 or 50 years from now..... I wonder if fifty years ago someone said, "You know what would be really swell?  If you could just type a letter and click a button and it could go instantly to someone far, far away!"

      Why would Lassie be in Holland on vacation in winter?  Jeff- you have a good point, but don't you think Lassie would be more likely to vacation in Holland in the spring when all the tulips are in bloom?  I think that if she were to go on vacation in the winter, she'd probably go to Florida or Mexico or Australia...in which case:  too bad Lassie didn't know how to surf. :)

      all this talk of sweets, i must inform you guys that here in England they do not have Oreos. it is crazy we were watching an american TV show and they were eating Oreos and the British Kids didn't know what they were, i almost cried in sadness for them i mean to not have ever had an Oreo in milk, or better yet a double stuffed Oreo in milk, or what about those different flavored cream center Oreos... i feel sad for them, and i feel sad for me cause all this talk of them really makes me want to have some. i am gonna have to find someone to send me some Oreos (double stuffed) so that i can save these poor British University students from their cookie (or to them, biscuit) ignorence.

      First off, I'd like to clarify that I gave up licking people for only the 2nd half of lent, and still am not licking.  hmm... "hi, my name is Taj and I'm a lickaholic, but I've been dry for almost one month."  As for the candy, I haven't given myself the chance to crave candy, since I've been gorging myself on it alot :)  not because i want to, but just because I can.  I should probably stop though, so I will.  I'll minimize my candy intake, and report back about cravings and such.  Does anyone want to send me some almonds?  they are REALLY healthy, and i would love it if someone sent me some ;) ;) ;) .

      all this talk about cheesecakes, and i didn't get any.  :(  sniff. sniff.  my boss forgot that it was secretary/administrator assistant's day.... oh well, i just started going to the gym, so cheesecakes probably not the best thing for me now anyway.   today is Plumber's Day and Pig in a Blanket Day, in case anyone cares.  i'm curious jesse, do you have this major craving for candy now, or did it go away after all this time?

      Did you know that people that chew on their pens/pencils (writing utensils...)  are more likely to make good secretaries?  i mean admistrative professionals?  that means that I would make an AWESOME admin professional, cuz all of my pens are chewed up, and even my highlighter is badly misshapen from my oral fixations!

      It is NOT Secretary's Day. There is no such thing.   It is Administrative Professionals Day. Big difference.   And I have 2 cheesecakes at home I think. In celebration of all the Administrative Professionals in my life, I'm going to eat one of them. That works out well.

      Aww, guys!  Today (Well, yesterday now...April 20)  is also the day of the Columbine shootings.  Sad sad.  I read a book when I was in 9th grade called  Rachel's Tears .  It was about Rachel Joy Scott and was written by both her parents.  It was really good, I want to read it again.  You should read it too.  I lent it to someone over a year ago, and they gave it to their friend and I don't know where it is now, it never got back to me.  That's okay though, hopefully it's still in circulation, it was good.  Basically, what I'm saying is that you can't borrow it from me.  Go buy your own.

      3 cheers for Jaron's randomness.   To bring up an old topic, those who claim that April is the best month for birthdays should remember that Hitler was born in April. April 20th, to be exact, which happens to coincide with Resurrection Day this year. Speaking of Resurrection Day, I had an awesome one, and I'm going to go write about it on my blog. So go read my  urlLink blog .   And speaking of which months are the best, I was born in July, and that's nice because I know other cool people who were born in July. But it's not necessarily the best month. All months are created equal, so quit your arguing. Although some advantage is given to January and February, simply because cold rocks.

Therefore I will not say anything more about it on this blog.  I have some good news today.  We had our thanksgiving turkey yesterday.  Yes, I know it was easter.  My grandmother's kinda strange.  A lot of you might remember my dad explaining what we had instead of that turkey on thanksgiving.

Jesus wasn't chicken to go to the cross  2. who cares? (ie. which came first the chicken or the egg?)  3. don't be cocky  4. Jesus is like a mother hen.  5. uhhhhhhhhhhhh..... well hey 4 out of 5 ain't bad... heh

      Jesse,  On your navbar, where you have your link for updates, it reads as follows:  &lt;p align="center">&lt;a href="http://swyftx.blogspot.com">Updates&lt;/a>&lt;/p>  This prodcues the undesirable result of loading your Blog in the navbar frame.  If should read as follows  &lt;p align="center">&lt;a href="http://swyftx.blogspot.com"  target="mainFrame" >Updates&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

      Okay rachel, way to go with the whole "confusing your superheroes" thing.  Robin was DEFINITELY not superman's sidekick.  Superman lacked a sidekick, and therefore no one would have said such a thing to him.  Everyone check out my new site that i have to do for my Rhetoric in Information Technology class!   urlLink www.calvin.edu/~jat4/

      Double posting at one time. Wowage.   Kairsie, Jaron did add on. It's just that you were confused.   He was walking down the street one day, when suddenly, Superman flew up through the drain in the street. Jaron said, "Wow, Superman, sie sind wonderbar!"  "Ich wei," replied Superman, with an air of superiority. "Hat dieses kleine baby einen bart?" Jaron inquired, looking at the little bundle of joy in Superman's arms. "Nein," replied Superman. "Ich hungrig." Of course. Jaron is always hungry. "Yo no tengo comida a hora." Superman is multi-lingual, but doesn't have any food. "Erinnern sie sich daran, dass ich innen 1000 doller geliehen?" That Jaron is one conniving individual.  "Nein." Jaron couldn't pull a fast one by the man who's Faster-than-a-Speeding-Bullet.

      When is Jesse going to the Galapogos Islands?  That is very exciting news.  Please don't get eaten by a sea turtle.  Janelle saw some really big ones down there, and some other big scary looking animals, I think sea cows or something, maybe manatees. :)  Barbara manatee, manatee, you are the one for me,....

      I disagree.  When the parents are married the baby is so and so llama-goat, so even if the parents split(which would be tragic and very sad and we would need to pray for reconciliation) the baby would still have the last name "llama-goat."

        Add on to  the story: So the one day I was walking down the street when suddenly......      Jonathan, it would keep it's origional last name...that of the father's, just like people do. If the goat and llama were to seperate before the birth it would most likely have the mother's last name. And I don't think either goats or llamas worry about being liberated or whatever

      What will they think of next?   The iLoo being developed by the MSN division of Microsoft Corp. in Britain is a standard portable toilet (a loo to the English)  with a wireless keyboard and extending, height-adjustable plasma screen in front of the seat. There would also be a "Hotmail station" with waterproof keyboard and plasma screen on the outside for those waiting in line. MSN officials say they're negotiating for the manufacture of toilet paper imprinted with Web addresses that users may not have tried. "The Internet's so much a part of everyday life now that surfing on the loo was the next natural step," MSN marketing manager Tracy Blacher said. "People used to reach for a book or mag(azine) when they were on the loo, but now they'll be logging on." The device is expected to be in use at festivals this summer in Britain, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported Tuesday. There's no word on if, or when, the iLoo will make its way across the pond.  Here's a diagram of what it would look like:  http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/030506/170/3zk3j.html  Interesting idea, but....um....I hope the keyboard is disinfected after every use.  Ewwww.   Dude, what's up with this music?

      What if the female animal in question is a liberated, feminist animal who refuses to change her name? I suppose you would have some new hybrid, hyphinated created. Llama-Goat or Goat-Llama. Confusing. And then, if the parents got divorced, whose name would the baby take?

        Jonathan, the answer to your random question depends on which is the girl and which is the guy, cause the woman always changes her last name.  IE: male goat + female llama = lloat baby      male llama + female goat = goama baby

      In defense of Ruthy, I would just like to say, that Gerber's are by far not the easiest plants to keep alive, particularly if kept inside in a pot.  I think I've even killed some at work, so Ruthy, don't feel bad, you just need an orchid like I have.  I can ignore for like at least a month at a time, and it just doesn't die, making it the perfect college plant.  Every other plant I had here died, but that was because of spider mites.

      The memories of my family outings are still a source of strength to me. I remember we'd all pile into the car - I forget what kind it was - and drive and drive. I'm not sure where we'd go, but I think there were some trees there. The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we played. I remember a bigger, older guy we called "Dad." We'd eat some stuff, or not, and then I think we went home. I guess some things never leave you.    'Manda!  I remember hearing about that when it first happened!  haha!  How'd you like to be his wife at the funeral?  "I'm so sorry about your husband.  How'd he die again?"  "He farted."

      this is so funny.  i found it on a link from netscape to "dumb things people do"  A florida man ate beans and cabbabe, then fell asleep in a poorly ventilated room.  While snoozing, he emitted a large amount of methane, which he then inhaled.  The concentrated cloud of toxic gas killed him.  Paramedics who removed the body also had to be treated at the local hospital.

      Ruth is bad with living things. My goldfish, the Gerber daisy (oh wow, as I was writing that I realized that it was just any old daisy, but a  Gerber  daisy, and now I am doubly ashamed of Ruth.) Let's shun her again. Shun. Never have Ruth babysit your children. And never play her in chess. She beat me. Grrr.    Random - If a goat and a llama made a baby, what would you call it? A lloat? Or a goama?

        I agree with Jonathan that Jaron is "the man" because he came up with a great random name for our one activity "The Chickens are Out"  So anyways, I tried about 7 times to log onto here, and every time it would say either my user name or password was incorrect. So I checked the caps button and it was off and I was just like "what the heck?"... then I realized I kept trying to sign in with "RireRose" which is my sign in name for basically everything else I'm apart of.

But either way, the thought of myself breaking up into 5 pieces and regenerating the rest of my body is a little weird...Maybe that's why starfish don't have brains, they can't think about that sort of stuff  Kelly

      ok, so [did you ever notice that i always start my exceptionally deep thoughts with "ok, so..."   just a warning]  i've been thinking about starfish.  one time, my dad was snorkeling in the ocean, and he found a starfish and put it up on his raft.  as it was in the sun it started breaking itself apart.  my theory is that it must have known it was about to die so it started breaking itself apart in hopes that one of it's appendages would survive.  i've been told that if a piece breaks off it becomes a new starfish.  so, does that new starfish have the same brain as the old one?  so now there are five of the same starfish swimming in the ocean.  which leads me to my question... what if all the starfish in the ocean are actually the same one?    this has been deep thoughts with ruthy,   tune in next time to hear ruthy ask "ok, so why aren't butterflies called flutter-bys?"

      Back to being random...  Sometimes kids are so cruel to animals, especially insects. I remember one time I caught this grasshopper, and I made him wear a little straw hat that I had made. Also a little pair of denim overalls. And I made him hold this little tiny pitchfork. So guess what he looked like? What is the enemy of the grasshopper and the one thing he wouldn't want to look like? That's right, a farmer.

      And then Superman crashed through the garage door, drunk, as usual. "Ich bin wunderbar!" And Jaron, sick of Superman and his antics, replied tiredly, "Ja, Superman, sie sind wunderbar."   And then Superman saw the stain on the floor. "Ay Dios mio! Das ist ein stingray!" And then drunk, linguistically mixed Superman fell over. Jaron laughed out loud. With as much sarcasm as he could muster, he tormented the incoherent Superman. "Ja, Superman... sie sind  wunderbar . Und das ist ein stingray. Muy bien, Superman. Tu eres muy, muy estupido." And then Jaron ran away, leaped back over the stingray, and went to sleep.

      it was dark, which made me a bit scared to begin with.  I was briskly walking through the garage when suddenly I saw a black form on the floor in front of me.  The only thing I could do, since I was moving quite fast, was to jump over it.  In mid air I looked upon this black form, and saw that it resmembled a sting ray.  My heart began to pound in fear as I landed on the other side of it.  A sting ray in the garage at my feet!  As I rounded the corner I regained my whits, and pondered what just happened.  I realized that the thought of a sting ray in the garage was popostrous.  Looking back at it more closly it is actually a stain on the floor.

      "Most starfish have separate sexes and spawn both sperm and eggs into the water, where fertilization and early development occur. Sometimes the mother retains the eggs on the bottom and protects them. Many starfish have the power to regenerate body parts, and in some starfish this becomes a regular means of asexual reproduction, new animals being produced from each fragment."  -"Starfish," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2003  urlLink http://encarta.msn.com   1997-2003 Microsoft Corporation.

      So when's this Simpson's Party, huh? And where? I said I'd provide the food, but I never promised to provide a location. We can't really do it at my house. But if someone with a DVD player wants to volunteer their abode for an hour and a half or so, I'll bring some pizzas or something, and The Simpsons. We'll have ourselves some good old-fashioned postmodern deconstructing the metanarrative of The Simpsons. Sounds like fun.

      I couldn't believe it! Someone had stolen my new sled! My brand-new, all-white sled, with the runners I had painted white and the white tow-rope and my name written on the top, in white. I asked all of my so-called friends which one of them took it, but they all denied it. Finally, in the spring, right after the snow melted, the thief brought it back to where I had left it.

      The verdict is out:  I'm officially trendy, or so says Jesse.  I started a blog.  Anyone wanna join?  Email me and I send you an invite.  Here's another invite for you young adults:   Friday @ 7.  My house.  Be there or be.....not there.  (But being there is definitely the better of the two choices!)  Bring games, your friends, and yourself.  Oh, and my house is pretty munchiless, so you may want to bring some of those, too.  Ladies may stay overnight if you'd like, but prepare to sleep on the floor or couches (the guestroom bed is reserved for a very special guest!).

      "Amanda is the Yentil of the group." It's so funny to read such a thing about one's self.  I don't think I would have said it about myself, either, but I suppose it's true?  But not because I'm an obsessed setter-upper.  It's more because I want my best friend to be loved by a great guy.  I just hope I'm not stepping on any toes.  Oh, by the way, I think it's Yenta, but I'm not sure. You know what I love?  I love being able to respond to people's blogs.  I think it's great!   Have you ever noticed that I say, "I love..." a lot!?  My friend whom I used to work with directed my attention to that little tidbit of me.  At first I thought it was something that I needed to change, that "love" should be a word reserved for the Lord and people.  Then I realized that this is just a part of who I am.  I tend to be passionate (Becky S. said I'm a drama queen) about much in life.  I think that is one of my better qualities.  You know, I could just go on and on, but this is not my blog.  Maybe I do need to start one afterall.  Wouldn't you all read it everyday to get your daily dose of Amanda?  Ok.... so maybe no one would read it.  That's ok.  I still love you.  Have a great Memorial Day! (By the way, when I remember the "sexy beast" line, I still laugh!  That night was so much fun!  I love hanging out with my friends and my bro, who I am also blessed to call my friend.)

      Meanwhile, the stingray sadly wondered why no one would play with him.  He got so excited when Jaron jumped over him, thinking that finally someone would be his friend and play games....but the boy had only looked back for a fraction of a moment, then turned and ignored the stingray's very existence.  Then, smack in the midst of his despair, in walked the stumbling man in tights!  The stingray had realized immediately that this was not the sort of friend he was looking for, even if the man had acknowledged his presence.  So he tried as hard as he could to blend in with stains on the garage floor, hoping that the smelly, drunken, babbling man would just forget about him.  In the end, he had performed such an amazing camoflauge that the boy left.  Poor stingray.  Poor, poor stingray.  No one to play with.  No one to love him.  Just a cold garage floor.

      Word.  Actually I've been to Fusion about.... 3 times... ever. I've been to some of their events, and to 180, but I rarely go to the Bible studies. Wednesday evenings are usually very bad for me, so I don't consider myself part of the "Fusion Bible Study" circle. I would go to the 5th Street Diner, cause that's usually when I finish work, but I never know when you guys are going to be there, unless someone calls me, and usually Lyn would be the person to calll me. :)

Then again, Fusion is for young adults, and....at 30...I guess you don't qualify. :)  Just kidding.  You were missed.  Here's your official invitation:  hang out with us. :)    Hey everyone:  Let's gang up on Jeff.  He went and had himself a baby.  What a traitor!  Just kidding, of course, Jeff.

      I'd love to talk about that, Amanda. Except I fail to see the logic of your comment. I can't really recall the last time I was invited to "hang out with all of [you]" and didn't. If memory serves me, which I think it does, I was trying to plan a Simpsons Party. It fell through. Nothing at all to do with Lyn, or "Jon think[ing] he's too cool." If you could give me something more concrete here, I'd love to talk about it. :)   Oh, and white is the collection of all colors when you're talking about  light  (i.e. video) but  black  is the collection of all colors when you're talking about printed materials. Kinda weird. I don't understand color theory.

      Nope, we're not avoiding the previous topic Kairsie.  Any suggestions as to why Jon does such?  My guess is that he has a nasty growth on his hip that he's trying to hide.  If he were to hang out with us, we might goof around with him and accidentally(wow, i cant spell that!) reveal his secret growth.  Or maybe he just thinks we're too immature, because Jon believes that mature people can't have goofy fun.  If that's true, I don't want to grow up.  (I'm a toys or us... teen)

If you really need something to discuss amongst yourselves (I'm all verklempt) you can talk about animal testing for the sake of medical research, since that's what I'm involved in.  You can also talk about your favorite color gummy bears, your favorite type of M&M (peanut butter, crispy, peanut, regular, etc.), or something about cheese.  I know you all love food, so go hog wild!    Under and in, The internet-less freak

      Hey.  I'm not not getting along.  I was just kidding about the Jon not hangin out with us thing.  There is one thing I'd like to say, though, about the not going to youth group discussion.  I think there's nothing wrong with someone growing out of the youth group phase, and entering a new phase.  Especially if it's not just that that person is skipping fellowship altogether.  Jesse goes to a young adults group.  Young adults can be crazy and fun, too.  :)  Anyway, no more shunning and negativity.  The thing about communicating via text is that there is a great deal of meaning that can be lost or misinterpreted without actually speaking the words.  Let's discuss something else now, like..... good movies?  Aren't we always looking for good movies?  I'm a rentaholic and I like renting movies that others recommend.  And then, just to make sure we don't lose our randomosity, we can talk about fish.  Grandma Walls used to eat fish eyes.  She said they chewed on them kinda like gummy candy or something.  Ew.

      my parents are now "considering" a cell phone...  apparently, the fact that I was paying $24 each month to call home made for a reasonable argument.

      Another thing:  Being mature is not directly associated with not having fun.  The problem I had was that I began to set a bad example ie. talking during highlights or not paying attention to the lesson.  I consider myself to have had a leadership position in youth group (at least before I left for college), and it is my responsibility to act responsibly in that position (I wonder if I can't use that phrase...) and to set a positive example for the younger members.  I was and am worried that I didn't and don't set the example that they need, and in fact counteract growth of the youngins.  It is for this reason that I had made my decision.  "amanda:" Had you even posted a link up on here for your blog??  I've not read it because I don't know the name.

      the whole point of me getting a cell phone was cuz i'm never home and people could never reach me.  well, what good is a cell phone if the battery dies, and your charger is at home and you don't get home to charge it up?  silly me.

      We'll just have to take your word for it, Jesse. Because between all the "lack of showing up at youth group" and all the talk of "I think the youth group brings out the immature side of me so I won't come any more," one might just get the impression that Jesse is "too old" to have fun anymore.

      I meant to come across as jerkish.  Why? cuz I'm a JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIUOOOOOORK! (a la Coach Z)    Trust me Jeff, I've been plenty goofy.  Just ask the people that are on my Peru team.  I got to play in the ball pit at Ozzy's (Formerly Family Grand Prix)!  I also got myself thrown into the pool at Kristi's graduation party.... well, not really... but half my clothes were thrown in the pool and I got mighty soaked.  The Fusion peeps will also account for my zani-ness.  Maybe if I had a cell phone, you guys could get a hold of me and beg me to add some zany to your life.  On that note, if any of you happen to see my dad in the next few weeks, please do one of the phollowing:  1.  If you have a cell phone, make sure you recount a story about where it was really helpful to have it (especially because you didn't have access to a pay phone) and, as a bonus, be sure to use it in front of him.  2.  If you don't have a cell phone, make sure you complain about how much you probably miss out on because no one can ever get in touch with you.  As you might have guessed, I'm trying to get a cell phone.  I could go out and get one by myself, but that would just make my dad angry.  I don't want to get one w/out his permission and blessing.  I'm such a good child.  Somos Monos!!!!  mmm... hot chocolated !  (it's like "arrowed," but better!)  Don't forget to check out my  urlLink  Dream (B)log    I've had lots of dreams recently, and I'll try to get them all posted...  *Gangs up on Jeff*

      Or better yet, Jamie, you could buy one Geo Prism and invest the rest of the money in the Kingdom of God. hmmm....???   You do tend to get what you pay for, but sometimes what you get is more than you need. And sometimes what you pay is more than what something's worth. Not everyone is called to college. And those who are called to college aren't necessarily called to an expensive one. Some are though, and thats fine. Walk in Gods calling. Although I must say apparently your Messiah education didn't quite cost enough to teach you that if someone is reading a  web page  they are already at a computer, thus negating the need to run to one. (no offense intended, just couldn't resist. *grin*)

      I read this post on Lyn's blog today...since her blog is not a public one, I thought I would use this avenue to respond...   Ok, Just clarify I realized my last post makes Rosedale seem like a total Hick school. My last post is true, but there are many great reasons why one should consider Rosedale. Maybe one day when I am really bored I will make a whole list of them. I loved my time at Rosedale, and I believe it is a Solid school with excellent Professors who live out their faith. There is alot of room for fun times too! And you could go 2 years and complete an Associates Degree there for half the price of one year at Messiah College!   Easy, my friend, easy on  urlLink Messiah ... :) I could also buy a 3 Geo Prisms for the price of one BMW.  Now, before all of you run to the nearest computer to email me nasty letters, I only propose that cost is not the only factor to use when comparing educations.  Just because its cheaper doesn't mean its a great deal. You tend to get what you pay for in this world, and it has been my experience that this holds true in college educations as well.

      Jonny Cash (That's what I called you when Becky and I spoke of you last night, and I decided I like it, so it will stick):  Yeah, like I'm gonna buy them from you now!  Just kidding.  Of course, when I made my comment about V&S cheesesteaks, I meant that they're the best if ZMYG cheesesteaks aren't available.  This shows quite a bit of confidence and trust on my part since I've never actually sampled a ZMYG cheesesteak.  I'm sad that you had a negative V&S experience.  I really love them.  Maybe it was just that particular steak that sucked.  Or maybe you and I just have different cheesesteak preferences, and that's ok.  Actually, typical Phila. steaks don't have sauce on them.  So maybe you were expecting the Phila. experience, and that's why you were so severly disappointed.  Please accept my sincere apology.  I meant you no harm. :)

      You know who has the best cheesesteaks (which is crazy b/c they aren't even in Phila.)?  V&S.  Mmmmm.  They put the cheese right on the roll, underneath the meat, onions, and sauce.  Very tasty.

      On the highly stimulating topic of Ctrl+Alt+Delete, I found an extremely useful resource that I wanted to share with all of you.    So often I want to use Ctrl+Alt+Delete, but I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER which keys I am supposed to type!  I know many of you have the same problem, so I wanted to share the life saver that I have found.  Before I found this page, I was lost and without hope everytime my computer crashed and I needed to use Ctrl+Alt+Delete, but thanks to Parson's Church, I can live my life with a new energy that I never knew before. Now all I need to do is zip over to the following page, and all my sadness disappears.  So, do I know why we use Ctrl+Alt+Delete? No, but have those three little buttons changed my life, YES! And now they can do the same for you!    urlLink Click Here  to have all your questions answered!

      Oh, and I have one other thing to say...I know the article on tatooing was just put out there to start discussion, and not meant to be the end of the discussion, but that being said, keep this one thing in mind.  The article was published by some tatoo association, and the author is probably all inked up, so I doubt you are going to have him say, "Hmm....while an avid tatooist, I believe the Bible teaches against tatooing".  All I propose is this...don't go to a site called Eternal Ink and expect to get a balanced discussion of tatooing.  Oh, and one more thing....just because someone says, "Lets go to the Bible and see what it has to say" does NOT mean that you should automaticly accept was was said. Thats not enough to base a decision on.  There are a lot of people who "prove" a lot of WRONG ideas using the Bible.  BTW....great topic for discussion.

      Attention all "young adults": You should come to this: Come join us at New Life Bible Fellowhip in Oley for a night of fun and worship! We'll be doing some game time in the gym, or spending sometime outdoors on a nice outdoor volleyball court After a while we will gather and spend the rest of the night worshiping with a worship band or worship team, and maybe a brief testimonial. This should be a great evening to get to know each other at fusion, and a great evening for new people to find out what we are all about. Plan on attending, and bring along a friend or two!  7pm.  Wednesday night.  Email me for directions.  amandamwalls@hotmail.com

      This is being written offline  Jesse, I find it difficult to fathom that you can somehow think that, as Christians, our only responsibility is to introduce people to Jesus. If you follow that thought process to its logical conclusion, I should carry a Bible and a Glock 9mm, and get everyone I meet saved, and then promptly put a bullet in their head, so that they can go be with Jesus. I know that everyone would agree that is ludicrous and asinine, correct? Im not saying that an inability to meet physical needs should prevent us from meeting spiritual needs, but meeting physical needs is highly important.   Yes, Jesus only fed crowds twice, but he also met physical needs in other ways, and showed that having your physical needs met is important.   Some examples:   Matthew 12:1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath." He answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread--which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.    Why would Jesus disciples need to eat? They had Jesus, in the flesh nonetheless, so why were they picking grain? Because they were  hungry . Jesus encouraged the behavior, too!   Mathew 8:23 Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. Without warning, a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!" He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.    Why didnt Jesus let them drown? They had Jesus, so why would they need to be saved from a  physical  calamity when they had their spiritual needs met?   Mark 5:21 When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live." So Jesus went with him.     A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed." Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?" "You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, `Who touched me?'" But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."   Why did Jesus heal that woman? He could have simply granted her eternal salvation and let her continue to suffer, right? Her  spiritual  needs would have been met. But Jesus wasnt content with that. He wanted the woman to have peace and to be freed from her suffering. He was in the process of giving life and life more abundantly.    AC 4:32 All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all. There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales  and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need.   Did you catch that? They were testifying to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, but look no needy persons [were] among them! Could it be that they were actually meeting peoples needs, both physical and spiritual?  If you can still tell me, Jesse, that people need Jesus only, with nothing done to improve their immediate condition, Ill continue to post things like this. There is plenty more in the Bible about this.

      Twice.  Twice.  Jesus feeds the crowd two times in the entire Bible.  So because of those two accounts, do you assume that every time Jesus taught people, he fed them as well?  I don't see that recounted anywhere else in the Bible except for those two times.  Jesus gave the people what they needed anywhere he went, but he didn't feed every single person he spoke to or even every person that followed Him.  So we should do differently?  If we can't feed the hungry, we can't make tell them what Jesus did, cuz then we're hypocrites?  I don't think so.  We have one need (We including me, you, all christians, all non-christians).    We need the saving grace of Jesus Christ.  If I don't ever breathe again, that's okay.  I'll be all right in the end.  If I never eat another morsel, but am saved by the only one who can do so, then "it's all gravy."  You tell me I need food.  I say you are quite wrong.  I need nothing else, the people of the world need nothing else, you need nothing other than the saving grace of Jesus Christ.  To disagree is to say that his grace is not sufficient.    2 Corinthians 12:9 - but He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."

      Whoo hoo! Jon's getting a prostitute! (just kidding!)   But seriously, I have thought about how many little gadgets and toys that I have and don't NEED in the sense that they are essential to survival. But, these toys sometimes make me a more efficient person. Cell phone, car, laptop. I wouldn't die if I lost these, but I would be a less effective person. I own a (as Shauna would say) "million dollar bass," but I use it for ministry. I could sell all I have and give to the poor, but I haven't felt God calling me to do that. I hope if I do hear Him say that I will answer.   Carrie: I don't want to get in to the whole "war" thing right now. Read my  urlLink old blog archives  for my opinion. You're right that welfare doesn't work, but we need  something  that will make a difference in these people's lives.   Jesse: I have to  strongly  disagree with your post saying that Jesus is all people need. Yes, Jesus is the  most important  thing people need, but they have very real, very present, very physical needs as well. Even Jesus didn't offer Jesus without meeting people's needs. Look at  urlLink Mark 8:1 . Jesus wouldn't send the crowd home without feeding them. Often Jesus' ministry centered on meeting people's physical needs. And look at James 2:14. What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.  If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder. You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?  Hmmm. You said "Maybe you think that sharing the gospel with someone without providing earthly "needs" is hypocritical." Yes. I absolutely do think it's hypocritical, and the Bible teaches that it is, too.

      Jesse:  Short of a miracle, people DO NEED to eat.  Otherwise they die.  Now, we could say, "Let's just bring them to knowledge and acceptance of Jesus's saving grace, and that's all they need, because when they die of hunger, drug overdose, etc., they'll at least go to heaven," and to an extent, that would be true.  In which case, quit your job, stop eating, and for that matter, stop breathing too because you don't really  need  to breathe, right?  I say...er...type this because I think that you misinterpreted my comment about needing to eat.  My point was that we can share Jesus with the urban (and even the non-urban) poor in our country, and that is truly their primary need, but if we don't teach them a new way to live, how likely is it that anything will change?  As Jon said, "I agree with Carrie that what people need is Jesus. As someone once put it, "A bowl of rice is not a substitute for the Holy Spirit," i.e. the Social Gospel without the Gospel doesn't work. But the bringing the Gospel without working towards societal change doesn't work, either. We can promise people a better life in the hereafter, but Jesus wants to see people living life "more abundantly." Living in a run down crackhouse, selling your body to buy food does not qualify as life to the full."

      Re: Jon: "You should sell your new camera and give the money to a prostitute. "  My sister, do you understand what you're insinuating with that comment?  heheheh *wink*   And Re: "Those people need Jesus, but they also need to eat."   While I'd like to be like some others and say I agree with everyone with everything they have to say, I completely disagree with this statement.  You do not NEED your car.  You do not NEED a house.  These people do not NEED food.  I'm not saying that we shouldn't try to provide these people with such things, but, in an eternal perspective (which every Christian should have), there is only ONE thing that anyone needs, and that's the saving grace of Jesus Christ.  If you can't provide a single meal for someone, but can show them that God loves them anyway and thus influence them to accept JC in their hearts, then they have everything they need.  Maybe you think that sharing the gospel with someone without providing earthly "needs" is hypocritical.  But I say that being unable to provide earthly "necessities" for a person or group of people should never keep you from going to them and telling them what Jesus did for them.  Sometimes you just don't have the resources to feed 35,378 people that need to hear the gospel.  So does that mean that you don't go to those people because you can't feed that many?  I had something else to say, but I haven't gotten much sleep this week and I can feel my brain faltering.  I'm just donkeying about I guess.    YAY! Half day of work today!!!!  Thank you everyone last night for some exciting bunny-age.  Keep an eye out for bunny-wear so we can start our underground bunny ring.  I'm sorry Shauna and sister for popping my vein at you, and everyone for being so anal.  Next time, just tell me this: "It doesn't matter in light of eternity!  Get over it!"  Mexican tonight possibly.....  Violet bunnies today...  Cute extra puppy at home...  Pa-king-wow!...

      I don't think anyone has ever said that we should turn our ears away from the cries of the poor and oppressed.... Isn't that what we were saying about education (formal or not)?  Wow.   We need more missionaries in our country.  Big time.  People God has called and provided support for to work in seemingly hopeless places with people in seemingly hopeless situations.  This has just reminded me how important state-side missions is.  Why do so many people think that "go" means "go over the ocean?"  Sad.  We need help.  Man, I wish I could do that...not need a paycheck.  But I'm reminded, also, of how much my kids need me where I am.  I'm going to miss them next year.... :(

       Jon:  Re:  "I'll tell you where the money is. $3.9 BILLION dollars PER MONTH to maintain a military presence in Iraq."  Your comment made me think of something:  Ok...not that I necessarily agree with the Iraq issue, but let's just keep in mind....what if our good friend Saddam  did  have WMDs, and what if we didn't invest the funds necessary to find them and to shut him down....what if we invested all that money into education, and what if he blew us all up anyway?  Just a thought.  Yeah, it's all about Jesus.  But for right now, there are people--all over the world, not just in our nation--whose lives are, for lack of a better term because it's 1:21am, crappy.  Those people need Jesus, but they also need to eat.  Hm... I guess we could debate these issues for hours, days, years on end, but--really--that would have been wasted time if we're not actually doing anything.  The best thing about all of this is the fact that, despite our differing proposed solutions, we're all looking for the same thing.  Jon and Jamie care enough to be passionate because we're talking about lives here.  I dunno...I'm kinda rambling...It's so easy to philosophize, and "politicize," but are we walking our talk?  Maybe you are.  Maybe you aren't.  I have no idea, and I'm not the judge, anyway.  My problem is that I tend to walk the fence.  I wimp out when it comes to making a decision as to where exactly I stand on various issues, perhaps because making a decision would require research (I refuse to make ignorant decisions when it comes to things like these), and doing the research requires time and energy....and there will always be someone better informed than I am anyway, but that's a pathetic excuse.  I guess maybe what I'm getting at is that we should let this be a challenge to each one of us to find out what we believe and why, be well-informed so as to intelligently and adequately defend our positions, and then to do more than merely speak them.  Be a doer. Wow, I'm tired.   (The bunnies wore me out!)

      By Carrie  Jon: you've gotta see that hand-out does not benefit these people hear what I am telling you. Like your article said they are bearly getting enough to live decent. I'm not saying get rid of it but it's like putting a bandaid over a cut that weeping already until you address the infection the wound will never heal.  I don't know exactly what the solution will mean and I agree love with actions is important. I didn't mean to sound like I'm saying just give them Jesus and all will be right with the world it takes more. But we have to look at this from a realistic view point quite pointing the finger and give some real solutions.   And as far as the war is concerned you don' t know that God did not ordain it. There was a threat and we addressed it. God put people in authority for a reason who are you to question it. But, until you are sitting at the Head of some millions of people who are demanding justice and millions more who think your a crock then you will understand what making real decisions means. My point being it's easy for you say these things from your dark little room behind your computer screen. So we were supposed let them gain strength to attack us and beside they made it no secret how they felt about America. They think we are of the evil on the whole Christians included. I mean it's scriptural Ishmael will always be a war with his brothers. Genesis 16:11-12  And you shall call his name Ishmael,  Because the  LORD has given heed to your affliction. 12 "He will be a wild  donkey of a man, His hand {will be} against everyone, And everyone's hand {will be} against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers."  Ok I'm done now I know this sounds like I'm hot but, I'm just passionate not mad.  signed Gleeful Bunny  I love debates!

      "Yes, the answer is education. But where's the money?" I'll tell you where the money is.  urlLink $3.9 BILLION dollars PER MONTH  to maintain a military presence in Iraq. That would fix up a good number of schools, make the student/teacher ratios more healthy, and in general improve society. I'm not trying to muddy the waters here by bringing up the whole war issue, it's a mite superfluous to this debate. BUT, the point is, the money exists. Yes we're in a recession, blah blah blah, but if we were to appropriate the funding we ALREADY have towards good uses, it would actually make a difference. But Republicans don't want to come off as soft on crime or distributing handouts. They need to learn that sometimes a "hand-up" has to first come in the form of a "hand-out." And sometimes the only way to prevent a young urban delinquent from becoming a career criminal is rehabilitation, not incarceration. Welfare doesn't work, but turning our ears away from the cries of the poor and oppressed works far less.   I agree with Carrie that what people need is Jesus. As someone once put it, "A bowl of rice is not a substitute for the Holy Spirit," i.e. the Social Gospel without the Gospel doesn't work. But the bringing the Gospel without working towards societal change doesn't work, either. We can promise people a better life in the hereafter, but Jesus wants to see people living life "more abundantly." Living in a run down crackhouse, selling your body to buy food does not qualify as life to the full. The underclass in our society needs our attention. We can continue rolling up the windows of our BMWs for only so long.  (welcome home, Rachel)

      I Carrie applaud you all for your passion. I actually agree with Jamie in that welfare does not benefit people but cripples them in a way that few can understand. But I also agree with Jon that though welfare doesn't help it is all we've got. I agree with Jesse in though I am Republican no party corners the market on every issue this country is facing. And I agree with Amanda that alot of the problem is lack of education and money to pay those to educate. Try as we might the problem will never be fixed the man power, money, and effort it will take to pull the lower-class minority or not up by it "bootstraps" does not exist.   We live in a fallen world and though these ideas look good on paper executing them is a totally different thing. That doesn't mean we should not try to choose the best political party or government representative. I believe it naive to kid ourselves in believing that man holds any of the keys it will take to make this world equal for most much less us all. That's why we evangelize because our eyes are not fixed on here but eternity. I've learned from Ruthy of all people prosperity is not necessarily what people need it's a relationship with the Most High. I grew up on welfare and even after I was saved I couldn't keep a job it was no one but the God how changed that and made me a productive person in society. I not trying to say that your argument is trite but get to the heart of the issue this country, this world, and especially our government need Christ or nothing can be accomplished.  Forgive me for intruding.

      I think this argum...er....intellectual debate is fun!  :)  You can debate all you want, just not on my blog.  :)  Jesse: I'd just like to point out that the "attacking" definitely went both ways.  Jon (& Jamie):  So if everything sucks so much, what's the solution?  It's so easy to become fatalistic when this issue surfaces, especially as a teacher.  Yes, the answer is education.  But where's the money?  Whether we like it or not, education requires funding.  Lots of it.  I'd love to be able to work with five students at a time, but that means schools need tons more teachers.  That means teachers' salaries will be cut.  That means unless one is independently wealthy and need not actually   survive  on a meager salary (as if our salaries aren't meager enough as it is!), a great teacher who actually has the passion and vision and intelligence and endurance to truly teach might be forced to seek other employment.  That means schools are more likely to become filled with sub-par teachers who teach only because that's the best they can do.  It's a vicious cycle.  Maybe someday educators will get the respect they deserve....  Ok.  I'm done.

          [Editors note: I wrote this offline before I saw Jon's response to Jesse. I only saw it when I came in to post this entry]  Oh my...its worse then I thought. :) Where do I start...I guess I will address this one point at a time. By the way...sorry for the length...my juices must be flowing today. :)   "...a discussion stops being an "intellectual debate" when it becomes emotional" --Hmm. First off, I don't know that you can say it became emotional.  But for the sake of discussion, I will temporarily grant you the benefit of the doubt.  I believe I disagree with you. Those are the best intellectual debates. Those topics that cause deep emotion are the topics that produce our best debating.   "The "discussion" you and Jon are having over this blog right now has, at least on your part, become emotional..." --Again, hmmm. I don't concede that it has become especially emotional or even if it has, that it is a bad thing. I have emotions. When I think a incorrect mindset is keeping people in bondage, you bet I'm gonna be a little emotional. That is precisely why I took the time to respond to Jon's email.  But it doesn't mean that it isn't an intellectual debate.  But I digress...onto the next point.   "Try rereading your post that begins by attacking Jon's reaction by calling it predictable. Pay special attention to the tone of the entry." --Sure I called it 'predictable'. It was predictable. I could have told you in a heart beat what he was gonna say.  How does that make it NOT an intellectual debate?  And what's with "attacking"?  I was simply responding to Jon's post. You see...its exactly what I am trying to say. People can't have disagreements without using negative words like "Attack".  I was simply putting forth the idea that I saw Jon's post as predictable. The point of view that he put forward was the same point that he made to me last time we had this discussion.  He could call MY response 'predictable' too I suppose.  Neither Jon nor I are gonna change what we believe every other day. We have had this discussion before. I have heard that point of view a hundred times in discussions of this issue. Thats why its predictable.  And what was my "tone"? I think he is mistaken. That was the "tone" that was supposed to come through. I hope it came through loud and clear.  Jon thinks the same of my opinion. So what...?   "Do you not sense the righteous indignation? The anger? The frustration?" --I hope you do! Thats exactly what I had! I do have all of those things when I hear points of view being espoused that I think are harmful to people.  That is precisely why I responded.  Again, your premise is faulty, I believe.  I don't believe those things are mutually exclusive with intellectual debate and disagreement.   "This results in attacks, like yours, against individuals and their opinions." --This is just incorrect. I didn't 'attack' anybody. Telling somebody that you believe they are wrong does not constitute attacking them.  If I were to tell Jon that HE was too dumb to understand my arguments, that would be an attack. Telling Jon that his ARGUMENTS are dumb, is not. I certainly did attack his opinions, but I did not attack him.  You know....I think therein lies the rub. I think we are living in a society where everybody is afraid to tell someone they are wrong. We live in a hyper sensitive culture where telling someone you think they are wrong is seen as close-minded and bigoted. I am not referring directly to you, Jesse, anymore. :) I am now making a comment on society at large. Being open-minded and having freedom of speech should not mean that I can't tell someone they are wrong.   "I would like to request that you take some time to calm down before your next post..." --I am quite calm....   "...just maybe, you'll be able to express your opinions objectively without calling Jon ignorant." --If you would kindly reread the post, you will see that I called the COMMENT ignorant, not Jon. I called it a few other things too while I was at it...namely racist, but I digress. :)   Now...for all of you who are new to intellectual debate, as well as those in Miami-Dade county, the above was an example of intellectual debate and disagreement with my dear friend Jesse. I do not hate Jesse. I did not 'attack' Jesse. I simply informed Jesse (and the rest of the world) why I feel he is incorrect on some things.  Class dismissed.

      I *gasp* totally agree with Jamie. It's a miracle.   Intellectual debate is vital, and if intellectual debate isn't passionate, it's not worth having. I'm very glad Jamie believes in what he says (even if he's wrong) enough to become emotional about it. You're right, Jesse, that sometimes emotions can hamper someone's ability to think rationally, but I can think rationally about dealing with the underclass and still be passionate about it. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was intensely emotional in his struggle for the rights of his people. But he was also logical and pragmatic. I think it's unhealthy if things get personal, i.e. "Not only are your arguments stupid but your underwear smells bad," but it's equally unhealthy to not be passionate.   (BTW, I thought Jamie's reply was level headed. Incorrect, but level headed.)

      I'm sorry Jamie, but apparently you and I have different views as to what constitutes an "intellectual debate."  I support discussion over matters such as these, and believe it to be extremely healthy.  The only way to verify our own opinions is to run them against those of someone else.  But I believe that such a discussion stops being an "intellectual debate" when it becomes emotional.  The "discussion" you and Jon are having over this blog right now has, at least on your part, become emotional.  Try rereading your post that begins by attacking Jon's reaction by calling it predictable.  Pay special attention to the tone of the entry.  Do you not sense the righteous indignation?  The anger?  The frustration?  I would never refer to such a post as "level headed."  When emotions get involved in such an issue, you begin to lose objectivity and, in turn, clarity of thought.  This results in attacks, like yours, against individuals and their opinions.  I would like to request that you take some time to calm down before your next post so that maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to express your opinions objectively without calling Jon ignorant.

As soon as Jon or I (or anyone, but it seems to be us most often :) ) disagree with each other and begin to discuss something, everyone runs for the hills saying "why can't we all get along!". Its like people have an allergic reaction when people start to have an intellectual disagreement.   If you believe in something and someone posts something that disagrees with it, why wouldn't you tell him why you think he is wrong?  I got it Jesse...maybe your spots were an allergic reaction to some intellectual disagreement you overheard!?!    And no Jesse, its not mucho defensivo.... its called intellectual debate.  (You know what I think this deserves a longer discussion..people's aversion to disagreement...check my blog sometime. maybe i'll say more on this topic.)  And also...what is so unrandom about discussing poverty and how to eliminate it. I thought the idea of a random blog was so anyone can post anything they want... Just because I am not going on and on about some stupid bunnies....man! ;)

      Perhaps my response was predictable because the problem is so systemic.   There's no need to repeat yourself. I read you clearly the first time. And I quote, "We live in a country where if someone is willing to work hard, just about anyone can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and make something of themselves."  That's a blatant lie. The poor in our country (especially those who are of a minority ethnicity) have been so brutally ignored by society at large that there are virtually no options left for them. They can't go to college because they can't read because the wonderful public education system has screwed them over. They can't get a job because they don't have a college degree. They have no transportation. They have no health insurance. They have no options. What's your solution, Jamie? Would your company hire a homeless man? No, of course not. He's not qualified. Whose fault is it that he's not qualified? His own? I doubt it. He learned it from his father, who learned it from his father, who learned it from his father, all the way back to slavery, where black people learned what white people (who hold the power in this country) really thought of them. Can the cycle be broken? It most certainly can be. But how exactly do you plan on providing a bootstrap? "[G]o find somebody that hasn't been as blessed as you, and start helping them to understand the power of education, how to be responsible in holding down a job, and be there to provide the viewpoint that they way out isn't more government programs, but in learning how to provide for oneself." They understand the power of education, and  understand that they don't have access to it.  They could be responsible and hold down a job... if they had access to a job. And they do provide for themselves. By stealing your wallet, stealing your car, selling your children drugs.  It's their only option right now. Welfare certainly hasn't changed it, but I haven't seen anything else that made a dent.   (Oh, and before you dismiss that article as liberal propaganda, look at who wrote it.)

      Wow Jamie... mucho defensivo...  At this point I would like to take Kairsie's suggestion and run with it....  Random random random unrandom random!!!  Did you guys know that if you make a rat addicted to morphine and then use a drug to put it into withdrawal, it shows the same effects as a menopausal woman having a hot flash?  Pretty cool, huh?  By the way my bunnies are growing tomorrow, but the new bunnies are being put into quarantine until August 6th.  *big big big smile*     (^)  (^)   .  o  \____/

      Jon's reaction is to my comments is so predictable. I should have warned you all. As soon as someone mentions that perhaps the "urban poor" (which is a pretty narrow view of who the poor are in our country, by the way) might be better off if they were given BOOTSTRAPS instead of HANDOUTS, liberals assume that you are calling the poor in our country lazy or something.  Do I need to repeat myself!? The poor in our country are not all that way becuase the are LAZY! For crying out loud. The knee jerk reaction that you get from some people regarding this issue...!   There are some in this country, however, who believe the poor in our country would be better off being able to provide for themselves then being dependent on somebody else. Am I saying that they have an easy situation? No.  Am I saying that we should just totally eliminate all of welfare? No...of course not. But if Christians would come alongside the poor and help them get educated, learn how the economic system works in this country, teach them many of the things that many of us learned growing up, INSTEAD of supporting institutions that only further this crippling dependance on others, many people would be better off.  So, get off your pulpit, go find somebody that hasn't been as blessed as you, and start helping them to understand the power of education, how to be responsible in holding down a job, and be there to provide the viewpoint that they way out isn't more government programs, but in learning how to provide for oneself.    And this racist comment that if you are a white, middle class person you somehow are unable to dialogue about issues that affect the poor is just ignorant.

      Last night's round of bunnies was so unbelievably exciting (and irascible)!  It was me and 7 girls (woohoo!), all of which cute, and all of which with cute, fluffy bunnies for me to destroy.  Mwahahahahaha...    Oh, and get this:  I went out with Shauna!  It was great!  She's like, so awesome.  We went out, and then we were all like, "this is nice."  Then we hugged and went back in again.   It was good while it lasted!  I think that we've decided to "just be friends" for a while, and while that's semi-disappointing, I understand that our friendship is something of immense value, and therefore I appreciate it greatly-ful.

Jamie:  You're just jealous because you have no bunny experience.  You could join us for our post-fusion killer bunny gaming if you'd like.  Then you'll see just how great those bunnies are.  I love those bunnies....*Sigh* Shauna:  I don't know your phone number!  :(  Call my cell:  610-914-3925

      Well, Jon, that's an article worth reading.  But I want to know what YOU are going to do about such an issue.  Are you going to institute tutoring programs in your church to help inner-city kids?  Are you going to assist inner-city schools financially outside of taxes?  We, as simple human beings, always face the self-proposed question: "I'm just one person.   What can I do about it?"  My guess is that you are considering a response related to affecting the government through a change in voting style or political alignment, but do you really believe that we can confront such issues only through the government via voting and political support?  I agree with Harold when he states that education is the most important key to overcoming poverty.  At this point in my life, though, I have a hard time seeing a part that I can play in such an issue.  I hope that some day the Lord will put me in a place where I can truly make a difference directly, but until then I educate myself in preparation for educating others.  This, then, is the part that I play now while you debate between two governmental parties that both have severe shortcomings.  To claim that a Republican vote or a Democratic vote is always the best choice is foolishness.  One should only vote based on the goals and qualities of a candidate him(or her)self.    Okay, so it has become obvious that I have little experience in discussing politics, but I think I may have brought up a good point or two.  Forgive my ramblings (I blame it on the seeming "disconnectedness" of the article presented and the issue being discussed.).

      Normally I wouldn't post such a lengthy article up here, but since Blogger is paying for both storage space and server bandwidth, I don't really mind.   I dare whoever's on this blog to read this article. And I dare you to read it with a mindset that is outside of your privileged, white, middle-class paradigm. Understand that you don't understand the issues here - you can't even begin to relate. So before you try to perpetuate this caste system we have in America, get your facts straight.   ---------------------------------------------------------  ( urlLink cornerstonemag.com )  What If There Are No Bootstraps?  An Interview With Leon Dash About His Book, "Rosa Lee" By Chris Harold    Rosa Lee is the story of a woman who upon first glance personifies every stereotype regarding inner-city poverty. Washington Post reporter Leon Dash deals straightforwardly with many of the stereotypes without himself falling into an ideological category. Dash, who won a Pulitzer for the book, followed Rosa Lee and her family for four years, hunting for clues in the world of the inner-city underclass.  Dash follows Rosas day-to-day struggles and traces her family history; what he finds is fascinating and heartbreaking. Rosa Lees grandparents carry their bottom-rung social status and their sense of racially-limited options with them to Washington, D.C., where they seek to escape the harsh life of North Carolina sharecroppers. Uneducated and unskilled, menial labor and domestic work are their only means of survival and the grandparents pass this emphasis on to their children. The cycle continues as Rosetta, Rosa Lees mother, educates her daughter by preparing her to survive the only way shes ever known, teaching her to wash, cook and clean. Dash thus follows an unbroken line of poverty up from the South into the vastly different circumstances of Rosa Lees life in the inner city.   Rosa Lee refuses the path of domestic work because she is unwilling and afraid to be at the whims of white employers. Then, acting in part out of adolescent rebellion, she becomes pregnant with her first child, Bobby, at fourteen. She has another, Ronnie, at fifteen, and then marries at sixteen. The marriage lasts only four months. In all, she has eight children by six different men. She begins shoplifting as a way to have nice things she cant afford. Her first contact with drugs is also the result of needing money. Of her eight children, two Eric and Alvinsomehow escape their mothers legacy; all the others follow her into drug dependence (Rosa Lee is a heroin addict), criminality, poverty, and in the case of her eldest son and daughter, the contraction of HIV. Her oldest son, Bobby, dies of it. Finally, in 1995, so does Rosa.   In all this horror, Dashs book shows the mystery of sin and responsibility as it works its way through generations. That Rosa Lee and her family were sinned against is evident in Dashs tracing of the familys roots (the discovery, for instance, that Rosa Lees older sister was conceived when her sharecropper mother was raped by a white overseer). Yet equally clear is that Rosa Lee also bears responsibility for her choices. As our understanding of Rosa Lee as a human being deepens, the inevitable questions come. We interviewed Leon Dash and asked him some of these questions.    Did your greatest shock come over Rosa involving her own children in crime?    Well, I was familiar with the oldest child in an underclass family becoming part of the parents criminal activity, or providing money for the family by some illegal means with no questions asked by the parents. But all of Rosa Lees children were brought into her criminal activity. It was for what she always called survival. Rosa, for instance, would buy a brick of marijuana and her children, right on down to the youngest, would sit around the kitchen table and cut this brick into what is called dime bags.    And you found this to be true of other families, this passing on of criminal behavior?    Yes. Its part of the Urban Institutes definition of the underclass, that the criminal behavior is generational.    But you say Rosa Lee would call this her way to survive. Did her government assistance fall short?   I knew from a past project I had done on teen pregnancy that welfare assistance is not enough to cover the necessities of life. I had seen firsthand that these families on welfare would regularly have no food in the house by the end of the month. This was also true for Rosa Lee and her family.    If the government made you poverty czar with full authority to change things from the ground up, what would be the first thing you would change?    Education is the single most important thing. It has not been working and this is not just a blip in history. Rosa Lee went to school in the 1940s. She, her children, grandchildren, and now her great-grandchildren have not gotten an education that would help them. Three of her five grandchildren cant read. Rosa Lee dropped out of school in the seventh grade because she was pregnant. But pregnancy aside, could she do seventh grade work? No. She couldnt even read. The problem is that the educational system is approaching children from the inner city in a conventional manner, attempting to teach these kids as if they were kids from middle-class schools. The educators refuse to deal with the real educational difficulties these kids bring with them to school.    How would you deal with it?    First, you cant put a teacher in a classroom with thirty aggressive, attacking, and profane kids and expect that teacher to teach. You have this middle-class teacher in with these kind of kids and they just drive her nuts. So, instead, have only five kids with a teacher. You must provide a situation where learning can actually happen and not just a teacher being the sergeant administering discipline and keeping order. And I mean this has to happen starting in kindergarten, not just junior high or high school.   But when I talk about these kind of things, people get very upset. They say it is unfair to send a disproportionate amount of their tax dollars to go to support these underclass kids. Why should they? What I try to say to these people is that youre going to pay for it in other waysin prisons, in police, welfare, or even by having your car hijacked.    The poverty czar then would need to appeal to self-interest to see his reforms through?    If this poverty czar proposes these kind of educational reforms, hell probably have to resign before hes out of office. He will become a lightning rod for these issues people are angry about. Its like talking about religion or politics; opinions about this are really charged with emotion. People dont want to pay more taxes than they have to; they want to have more money for themselves. So a poverty czar would just have to know hell never make it to the end of his term. The best he could do is raise these issues and get things moving in the right direction. But, of course, what we really need is the political will to deal with these kind of underclass issues. Right now we dont have that. We need to have people in politics who are willing to sacrifice their careers to deal with these issues.    Compassion could give us this political will, but how are we going to be inspired to this kind of compassion, especially in this time of politically scapegoating the poor?    I dont know. Honestly I dont. We need a charismatic leader, but we dont have one. I just dont know. I was giving a talk recently and a man stood up and said regarding Rosa Lee, Why are you so sympathetic with this person? He was one of the angry ones. I said that I didnt really see myself as sympathetic. I mean, I had learned about how Rosa Lee had prostituted her eleven-year-old daughter, Patty. Who wouldnt be repulsed by such a thing? Of course Im not sympathetic to that. But, I said to him, I guess Im just not as eager to condemn her as you. I cant judge her as harshly or easily as you.   This man was one of the haves who cannot understand the have nots, who simply see people like Rosa Lee as morally reprehensible. These haves keep telling the have nots to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Im here to remind them, Hey, these people dont even have bootstraps! Give them a break!    So the problem is that these haves dont understand that if they grew up in the same circumstances from the time they were born, they might not be the person they are today?    Absolutely. I would not be who I am today had I grown up in Rosa Lees circumstances. Theres no way! And thats what I try to remember and tell others, Hey, there, but for the grace of God, go I.    What main insight do you hope the average middle-class American would gain from reading your book?    That there is an underclass. That it is growing and its a problem for all of us.    What practical steps could the average middle-class American take to help with the problems of the underclass?    Mentor one child. Tutor one child. Alvin and Eric, the two of Rosa Lees children who made it out of poverty, both had mentors (Gartrell Franklin and Nancy McAllister) who helped them at crucial points in their lives.    If you could go back in time to when Rosa Lee was young, do you think that kind of intervention, mentoring, might have made her story come out differently?    Its funny, Rosa Lee used to say to me, Mr. Dash, I wish I would have known you when I was younger. You could have helped me. But I would tell her that I didnt think when she was a young woman she would have listened to me.    Could you give me an example of how Rosa Lees limited range of choices counter the simple solutions offered to her?    In Rosa Lees case, what jobs are available to her? She cant read. There are few jobs for you if you cant read. She cant work at any kind of hard labor because shes an older woman in poor health. So in a case like hers, simply moving someone off welfare will not guarantee he/she will get a job. People also dont want to deal with the history behind this, the whole history of racism that has played its part in lives of those like Rosa Lee. Fifty-seven percent of the underclass are black.   An especially haunting moment comes when Rosa Lee remembers her grandfather who was a poor sharecropper from North Carolina. She recalls how he never laughed, and one day she asked him why. He says, We had such a hard time down in them sticks I guess I just dont see nothin to laugh about. And Rosa Lee didnt understand this answer.   Right. That shows how the effects of racism came down to Rosa Lee without her even understanding what happened to her. Her mother Rosetta raised her according to what she knew from growing up in the South, which meant if you were a black woman you learned to do domestic work to survive.    Does racism continue to play a part in the poverty of the inner cities?    Yes, it does. One explanation is that people see poverty as a minority problem. This I think is due to the fact that the main media are located in urban centers and the reporters are simply too lazy quite honestlytoo lazy to go out and show the other faces of poverty in rural areas. Although the majority of those in poverty are black, there is still a large population of whites who are in places like southern and western West Virginia, Kentucky, and also in the upper peninsula of Michigan. So then its difficult to get funding for all who qualify for programs like Headstart, which is a proven program, because people dont want their money to go to what they see as a primarily minority problem.    You point out that as we become more of a technological society there are less and less jobs for low-skilled workers. As a result future generations such as Rosa Lees grandchildren and great-grandchildren, trapped in the cycle of poverty, will have even fewer opportunities. If there is no intervention in their lives, what do you see in the future for them?    I was quoting there from the Swedish sociologist, Gunnar Mydral. He predicted as far back as 1962, in a book called Challenge to Affluence, the emergence and growth of the underclass which we are seeing today. As far as what will happen in the future? The underclass, according to the Urban Institute, is growing at a rate of 8% (that was how fast it was growing at the 1990 census). Now some sociologists are beginning to refer to the underclass as an undercaste. Thats because they see the dividing line as so definite, they dont see any way for movement out of that underclass. The divide is that great they dont see any solutions to this division. So this trend is growing and its a problem thats not just going to go away. Also you must remember that these people in the underclass2.7 million in 1990they dont even appear in the unemployment statistics.     How is that?    They have never held a job long enough to be considered employed, or they have never been employed, so they arent considered unemployed. So this group is not even represented in these important statistics. Theyre invisible.    Near the end of her life, Rosa Lee is received back into her childhood church with open arms. Do you see anything more that her church or churches in general could do for those in poverty?    Yes, I think especially mentoring and tutoring programs are important. They can show a child another way of life they might never see otherwise. Mentoring and tutoring are two tremendous ways to help.

      Great story Amanda....boy I can't wait to hear Jon's response to this story. Should I prepare myself for another bleeding heart rant.... ;-) Not everyone that is poor is that way by choice or because they are lazy or something, but the fact is that we are turning into a country where everyone thinks they are entitled to a life of ease and comfort. Even if they have to get a paycheck for NOT WORKING, paid for by other people.  IE...welfare.    We live in a country where if someone is willing to work hard, just about anyone can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and make something of themselves.   Why do you think immigrants stream into the US? No other country on earth provides the same opportunity to better oneself.  You might laugh at Amanda's story, but it isn't so far from the truth.  We overtax the very members of our country that have made a decision to work hard and further themselves financially. The more you earn, the more we punish you.  All of this to pay for many overfunded government programs.  The Bible calls Christians to help the poor...not the government....I don't see much in scripture supporting welfare programs by the government.  Actually one of the few responsibilites that I can see that the Bible DOES give to government, is the responsibility to use force bring wrongdoers to justice (police force/army). If you read the Bible, you will see a very limited view of government.....So you see, even Jesus would have voted Republican!   (That last one was for you, Jon ;-) )

      Let's see... where to play bunnies... where to play bunnies...  Ruthy and I are speaking tonight, and I don't think that it'll go very long.  So it won't be too late when fusion is over.  I think we could probably get a game in at the church, but if we want to continue with another game we'd have to move.  Like I said, I really don't wanna risk my cards at a food servery.  We could invade my sister's house *wink wink* or crash Becky and Ruth's house once again :D .  Someone offer a location!!!  On a side note, my bunnies are coming via UPS.  I hope they leave them at the house even if I'm not there to sign... *worries*

      No Kairsie.  You are wrong.  The moral of the story is "Vote republican."  You know how I know this?  I know this because at the bottom it says the following:  "MORAL OF THE STORY: Vote Republican"  Who are you to disagree with the story about what it's morals and values are?

      Hey guys.  Read this.  A friend sent it to me.  I'm interested in hear ya'll's opinion. :)  OLD VERSION The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.  Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed.  The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold.  MORAL OF THE STORY:  Be responsible for yourself!   MODERN VERSION The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a   fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.  Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. CBS, NBC, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food.  America is stunned by the sharp contrast.  How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?   Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper and everybody cries when they sing "It's Not Easy Being Green."         Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where the news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome."       .     Jesse then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.         Tom Daschle & Walter Mondale exclaim in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share.  Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act", retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pa y his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients.  The ant loses the case. The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he doesn't maintain it.  The ant has disappeared in the snow.  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood.  MORAL OF THE STORY: Vote Republican

      Speaking of Community Days..... John:  We were there, too.  The ash is what made it so much fun!  I usually am not a big fireworks fan.  In fact, I think they're kinda lame, but a nice excuse to hang out with friends.

      Jesse,  Your dad has a point... things should be planned ahead of time. However, plans often change, and cell phones make it possible to do things that never would have been possible without them. Like change your plans last minute, find your friends in a crowded area (like Community Days) or go on the ZMYG Road Trip. (That wouldn't have worked without cell phones.) So yes, it pays to plan ahead, but it also pays to have a cell phone to allow for greater coordination.

      Jesse:  "whuteva" Yay!  Bunnies tomorrow!  Rock on!  Carrie:  Sorry, hon.  I did get your voice mail (ON MY CELL PHONE), but I was watching a movie with Bec.  Contrary to what SOME PEOPLE think, cell phones are great tools for getting the most out of one's day, and there is definitely something to be said for spontaneity!  Why does everything need to be planned ahead of time?!  What's so great about that?  Yes, planning definitely has it's place, but when you live every single hour of your life by a preplanned schedule,....where's the fun in that?!

      Ms. Snead, I believe you overestimate the frequency at which we check this blog.  I don't know about the others, but I only have the chance to come on and check it one or two times each day.  To invite us to see a movie within 2 hours of its start time is quite ludicrious.  Why?  because no one will see the invitation in time to do anything about it!  I, in fact, am rather sad that I didn't know you were going until today, when it's too late.  Why didn't you call me at home?  If you had access to a computer, you had access to a home phone.  I'm sorry my friends, but my father has a point in his argument for me NOT getting a cell phone:  You are all terrible at planning things ahead of time, and cell phones would be less of a necessity if you could learn to do so.  My sister will probably get angry at me for saying that, but hey, it's true!    I checked on the UPS website aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.........   MY BUNNIES COME TOMORROW!!!  Let's play the bunny game after bible study, okay?    Preferably at the church and not at the diner.  I will not risk the safety of my cards.   *wiggles in excited anticipation*

Besides, you can just look at the bottom of a post to see who posted it.  Don't be lazy, brother, dear.

I'm working in the library. love you..bye bye.  To answer your question Kairsie I did not know that snails can live 3 years w/out eating. Where did you find that out?

      I'm sorry, but I disagree with my sister on that point.  I like the fact that Carrie and Becky put their names BEFORE the message, that way I know who's saying it while I read.  If you have such a desperation to look to the bottom, you can do so, and see that its written from the shared "Carrie and Becky" account, and know that they are not talking to themselves, they are describing who is talking.  Deal.  Oh, I loved the bunnies sooooo much that I ordered them for myself yesterday.   Thanks Jon for introducing me to it.   Thanks dad for letting me buy it.  Thanks sister for being jealous.  And thanks Red booster pack for giving me the edge over Jon.  ;)  Oh, and Carrie, I don't think Ruthy had any spots.  My spots were unique and my own.   But they are gone, but I still am in danger of getting a fever and chills if I overexert myself late at night.   Kinda scary.  Okay, back to work.  I love this blog.  Do you love the puppies??

        It all depends on if the weather man (or woman) is an optimist or a pessimist. An optimist would say "partly sunny" and a pessimist would say "partly cloudy"  ::psst if you really wanna know, partly sunny would be like 1/4 sun 3/4 cloud: partly cloudy would be 1/4 cloud 3/4 sun::

      Balance is good   I havnt read all the posts, but it looks like there is good discussion here - which rocks  Faith and Works... Works and Faith - its all a matter of balance - you are both right really :)  oh... and practice has to do with callings, giftings, and being the hands, feet, eyes, and ears of Jesus... get it?  different body parts for different purposes - all working together to make the body healthy, and productive.  so yall need to recognize your need for each other.  And the callings that you have on your own lives.  thats what I think

      I agree, Jesse, that we should evangelize, no matter what. But I also believe that being a missional person, or a missional church, is an all-encompassing endeavor. It's so much more than going around quoting John 3:16 and leading people in a quick sinner's prayer. It's being willing to come along side a person or group of people and walk with them, help them meet their needs, demonstrate the love of Jesus in a practical way. That's what's awesome about the Incarnation - no longer was the love of God a distant, abstract concept, but the Love of God put on Human Flesh and became a Man, sharing in our sufferings and meeting our needs. We can't present Christ as a distant figure who will bless you when you die. We need to present Jesus as a friend who sticks closer than a brother, and we need to show that we are the example of His love and His life - and one of the ways we do that is by blessing people.  Here, read  urlLink this .  The Word of Life - Abandoning an Incomplete Gospel

      My argument: "But I say that being unable to provide earthly "necessities" for a person or group of people should never keep you from going to them and telling them what Jesus did for them. Sometimes you just don't have the resources to feed 35,378 people that need to hear the gospel. So does that mean that you don't go to those people because you can't feed that many?"  Jon's response: "Im not saying that an inability to meet physical needs should prevent us from meeting spiritual needs, but meeting physical needs is highly important. "  Basically, if you can go and feed the hungry while telling them what Jesus did, go and be blessed.  If you can't feed the hungry, go anyway, telling them what Jesus did, and be just as blessed.  Sometimes, short of a miracle, we just can't provide for physical needs.  This should never keep us from evangelic missions.

      This week has been great....Terri Gross has been on vacation I think.  Praise the Lord...  I can actaully have a chance to enjoy Fresh Air.  Second observation....It is quite evident that the vast majority of Palestinians have very little interest in peace.   On the day before Israel was actually going to turn over control of a bunch of cities BACK to the Palestinians, the Palistinians murdered a busload of innocent men women and children.  Now the West Bank is locked down tighter than Fort Knox.  You'd think the Palestinians would catch on.....but I guess not.   Over and over Israel makes efforts at peace, and over and over gets burnt.  Its a wonder they keep trying.

      As a Christian, how do you justify speeding?  It's breaking a law just like murdering someone is against the law; however, many of us do it everyday (some to the extreme) without a second thought.  And don't give me some excuse like "the faster to get to ministry..."

      Kairsie killed the discussion blog...   oh wait, the death of said blog had nothing at all to do with Kairsie.    Jon, Jeff, and Jamie decided to shut up when an outlet was provided for their rantings... i mean... discussions...  I need to remember that tactic for next time.

      Someone remind to correct Jamie in the error of his ways when I get a chance... (just so you know, I am in no way in favor of Madonna's publicity stunt on MTV, it's just that Jamie's critiquing it in all the wrong ways.)  I just got an e-mail from Janelle. The subject was "if I blogged" and she said that "I'd spend my $115,000,000 on fixing up Philly row homes and connecting them with families who'd love them"  She also e-mailed me this link -  urlLink http://www.flashmob.com/

      Wow!  I stopped checking this blog because no one was blogging much.  Then I check in today, and there's lots and lots!  Can I just tell you how fun that is?  It's like being away from your computer or Internet access for a long time and not being able to check your email, and then...when you finally do....there's a gajillion emails!  Okay, maybe not, because they aren't addressed to me.  Or, an even better illustration is when you don't watch TV for a really long time (my life is way too busy for TV, I can go for months without it, except in Alias season), and then you turn it on to find out that there's a marathon of your favorite show (like Alias; it rocks!) and there's a whole bunch of new episodes and you get to watch them all at once instead of waiting a new week for the new one.  Anyway, my point is that it's very exciting.  So I haven't read all of the things that were posted during my absence from the "random" blog, but the ones that I have read have been extremely entertaining.  Like this one by Jamie, for example: "What would I do with 115,000,000?? I would give it to George W. Bush to get him elected to a second term, just so Jon would get really irritated." That's so great, Jamie D.  I think that's a great way to spend the cash.  Man, I really need to get you and Jon and Jeff to have one of your discussions when my friend Bec is around.  It might be a little more even on the sides....  Off I go to finish reading all the posts I missed.  This is great!

Which makes him cry even more and he asks...."will you pray that my gummie worms make it....and maybe the cute girl that I tried to give me phone number will call me?   XxXRireRoseXxX: and we just look at each other like ummmmmmmmmm and i say " i'm sure the gummie worms will be ok"   Godsgirl2472002: Then he says "My friend isn't going to sleep tonight if he doesn't...those gummie worms where from my closest friend...my mom"   XxXRireRoseXxX: and then i just pat the dude on the back and say "it'll be ok" and walk away scared   Godsgirl2472002: Then we wake up to the annoying buzzing of the alarm clock

      See, Jamie's got the right idea. As we see in the Bible, God really is a jingoist. His promise to Abraham was that only members of Abraham's race, ethnicity, and creed would be blessed. That whole " urlLink through your seed all nations will be blessed ," that was just a mistranslation. And Abraham really was American. And of Anglo-Saxon descent. Not a Middle Eastern nomad. All those people are heathens.   What would I do with $115,000,000? Quit my job and go be a missionary. I think I would put most of it towards missions, long-term and short-term. I would also give some charitable contributions to organizations like  urlLink ACTV  and  urlLink DATA  and other things with cool acronyms. And I would buy a  urlLink Porsche . Actually, I would buy two Porsches.

        I think that having serious discussions on the R=G blog actually adds to the randomness. For instance let's say you're reading a debate between Jon and Jamie, when suddenly there's a post by Jaron that has absoluty nothing to do with anything. It's much more entertaining when it's unexpected. If you're constantly random it wears off the effect. You have to randomly be random.

      I thought the bible teaches us in Rom 13 to submit to authority, not kill them.  I thought we are supposed to obey our superiors.   and since the blog nazi is the authority - as creator of this little universe (imperfect as it is)  does that mean we should obey him no matter how evil he is?  so when is it permissible to overthrow a government leader?  How "evil" must he be before he deserves not to be obeyed... and then how evil must he be before he deserves to be sacked by your pillow?  oh... and I will be building a pumpkin launcher just in case your pillow doesn't bring surrender.... to rock the blog nazi beyond shock & awe.  He will never sleep in peaceful comfort again.  (that is unless I feel conviction by the holy spirit, and decide to obey in humble submission)

      No Jon.....Paul espoused force (Specificly the sword) as a means to combat evildoers.  Jon....do you believe that force is NEVER the way to solve a problem?  This is an honest question.

      So who will play the blogging world's role of Dietrich Bonhoeffer to our new Fuhrer? I nominate Jamie, because he espouses violence as a means to solve problems.   (as an aside... "I think this blogging issue is a fascinating study in sociology. Why will the DiscussTHIS blog fail? Because those who post believe no one will read it.")

      Yes, Jack Handey is who she means.  He writes great things, such as this:   I remember I was hammering on a fence in the backyard when Dad approached. He was carrying a letter or something in his hand, and he looked worried. I continued to hammer as he came toward me. "Son," he said, "why are you hammering on that fence? It already has plenty of nails in it." "Oh, I'm not using nails," I replied. "I'm just hammering." With that, I returned to my hammering. Dad asked me to stop hammering, as he had some news. I did stop hammering, but first I got a couple more hammers in, and this seemed to make Dad mad. "I said, stop hammering!" he yelled. I think he felt bad for yelling at me, especially since it looked like he had bad news. "Look," he said, "you can hammer later, but first-" Well, I didn't even wait to hear the rest. As soon as I heard "You can hammer," that's what I started doing. Hammering away, happy as an old hammer dog. Dad tried to physically stop me from hammering by inserting a small log of some sort between my hammer and the fence. But I just kept on hammering, 'cause that's the way I am when I get that hammer going. Then, he just grabbed my arm and made me stop. "I'm afraid I have some news for you," he said. I swear, what I did next was not hammering. I was just letting the hammer swing lazily at arm's length, and maybe it tapped the fence once or twice, but that's all. That apparently didn't make any difference whatsoever to Dad, because he just grabbed my hammer out of my hand and flung it across the field. And when I saw my hammer flying helplessly through the air like that, I just couldn't take it. I burst out crying, I admit it. And I ran to the house, as fast as my legs could take me. "Son, come back!" yelled Dad. "What about your hammer?!" But I could not have cared less about hammering at that point. I ran into the house and flung myself onto my bed, pounding the bed with my fists. I pounded and pounded, until finally, behind me, I heard a voice. "As long as you're pounding, why not use this?" I turned, and it was Dad, holding a brand-new solid-gold hammer. I quickly wiped the tears from my eyes and ran to Dad's outstretched arms. But suddenly, he jumped out of the way, and I went sailing through the second-story window behind him. Whenever I hear about a kid getting in trouble with drugs, I like to tell him this story.

      You see, Hitler was a really good leader for his people before he got all evil and crap.  He provided for them and looked out for em and stuff, otherwise he would have been overthrown earlier and stuff.  I'm trying to be a good leader by providing for everyone.  A place for everything and everything in its place.  That's what I always say... sometimes.  Just trying to provide for the satisfaction of both those who want serious, political discussion and those who just want to relax and be entertained/ entertain others.  Moving all those posts to the discussion blog is better than just deleting them, isn't it?  if you'd like, I can just do that instead.

      Dude!!!   So... you're all big on smurf hunting and all... but... there's a problem with that.  You see, for chaos day, each dorm on Calvin's campus has some sort of theme.  For Beets Veenstra (kelly's dorm) the theme is Ghost Busters.  Boer Bennink has a GI Joe theme.  My dorm, though, has the theme of smurfs.  Yes, you hurd me, smurfs.  And let me tell you, no one will be hunting down US.  We hunt down the other dorms and kill kill kill.  Hooray!

      Okay, so I was really going to reply to everything that was said.  Really, I was.  I haven't been online for a week (apparently a very active week for the R=G blog) and had lots of catching up to do.  But now I'm really really hungry and, hey, who thinks well on an empty stomach?  Here's what I will say:  I definitely agree with my sister about the debating getting very harsh.  I think I remember saying that before, as well.  If I said it about Jeff, though, I apologize.  Jeff has some very good things to say, and a very efficacious method of presenting his point  without  insult or personal indignation.    Jamie, I think maybe you should consider your own methods of presentation.  Are you sure that the things you say are said in love?  It doesn't quite feel that way to me.  Don't take this as an attack; it's more of a request.  Please say what you have to say in love, you Christian, you.  Okay, gotta eat.

       Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better computer programmer. This goes on for a few hours until they agree to hold a contest with God as the judge.  They set themselves before their computers and begin. They type furiously for several hours, lines of code streaming up the screen.  Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over. He asks Satan to show what he has come up with. Satan is visibly upset, and cries, "I have nothing! I lost it all when the power went out."  "Very well, then," says God, "let us see if Jesus fared any better."  Jesus enters a command, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers. Satan is astonished.  He stutters, "But how?! I lost everything yet Jesus' program is intact! How did he do it?"  God chuckles, "Jesus saves."

      Jon & Jamie & Jeff:  I think it's great that you are debating all of these things,  but the debates have definitely taken on a very negative tone, which makes visiting this blog not so pleasant.  I'm all about friendly debate, but sometimes it goes too far.  I'm ready for you all to attack me because you are all just having an "honest disagreement and discussion."  It's just that it has come to a point where the negativity far outweighs the cheeriness, randomosity, and pleasantness.  It's just not fun anymore. :(  Oh well.  It doesn't matter.  This isn't even my blog.  I just wanted you guys to know that it makes me sad.  And now I'll leave you to your debating...so long my blogging friends.  I'll miss you.  *Sniff*

      oh... before I get back to work, hope all yall single folks enjoy this - these pickup lines really work!  Christian pick up lines:  - Excuse me, I believe one of your ribs belongs to me.  - My friend told me to come and meet you, he said that you are a really nice person. I think you know him. Jesus, yeah, that's his name.  - You know they say that you have never really dated, until you have dated a Christian.  - Yeah I predicted David over Goliath.  - Did I tell you that my great-uncle was a personal friend of Billy Graham?  - What do you think Paul meant when he said, 'Greet everyone with a holy kiss'?  - You have the body of Amy Grant and the soul of Mother Teresa.  - You know, I'm really into relationship evangelism.  - I'm pretty flexible - I don't think a woman should be submissive on the first date.  - Before tonight, I never believed in predestination.  - Just looking at you makes me feel all ecumenical.  - I hear there's going to be a love offering tonight.  - I want to check your shirt label to see if you were made in heaven.  - I know why Solomon had 700 wives, because he never found you.

      Jamie, if I missunderstood I'm sorry... to me, your post seemed more like a rant than "mourning."  I didn't mean to attack your post,  I agreed with much of it.  We should call sin, sin... but mostly calling sin sin is helpful in the context of the church... for example if we found girls that profess Christ making out.  Then you should not go easy on them, but hold them to a higher standard... do you know what I mean?    Jesus went easy on the sinners, and was harsh  to religious hypocrites...  I tend to have the same leanings.    But the difference is that even non-believers believed in moral right and wrongs.     what do you mean by that?  what morals?  the word moral is too general, it can mean something to one person, and something completely different to someone else.  "moral" people kill people every day.  Sometimes, "immoral" people actually are quite nice people - going to hell, but pretty easy to get along with.  did you mean that back in the day "even non-believers believed in   BIBLICAL   moral right and wrongs."?  Because thats sort of what I was getting at.  I believe that statement to be generally true in many cases, BUT  I'm not sure that it is worth mourning.   Unfortunately, now there are many in our country that believe that they can get to heaven just by being a good american.  It has led to a great lukewarmness in the church... now thats worth mourning.  Christians should hold each other to a very high standard... but the sinners, well we need to accept and love them as they are.  Does this sound reasonable, or crazy.  ummm  now Im not getting my work done.  ok... back to work

      Allow me to quote at length (because, hey, I'm not paying for the server space...)   "Can you imagine a lesbian kiss on national television even 10 years ago? Of course not. Can you imagine the amount of sex that is on just about every sit-com now being acceptable 40 years ago. Of course not. I have had people tell me that the culture is not deteriorating in our country. Thats the most unintelligent and inane comment I have ever heard. Just take a look around. Even non-believers acknowledge it. We are steadily eroding the foundation of morality that our conuntry was built on. Was everybody a christian back in the day? Of course not. But the difference is that even non-believers believed in moral right and wrongs. Even non-belivers acknowledged that there was a clear definition of what was right and wrong. The moral deficiencies we see today are a clear result of the moral ambiguity created by our post-modern culture."   I take issue with almost that entire paragraph.  "We are steadily eroding the foundation of morality that our conuntry  [sic]  was built on."  The more that I learn and the more I filter out the propaganda I've been inundated with for my entire life, the more I realize - my country was not founded on morality. My country was founded on rebellion. How does the Revolutionary War stand up to a Romans 13 litmus test? It seems to fail miserably. "Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves." That's what Paul, inspired by the Holy Spirit, said. Our wonderful, "Godly" forefathers, inspired by greed, said, "[W]hen a long train of abuses and usurpations... reduce[s] them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government." How would Paul feel about that? Oh, I forgot. We were justified because we won. So, point A, I have a country founded on rebellion. I have a country expanded at the expense of the dignity and, yes, even the lives of the indigenous people of this continent. Is that Christ-like? Founded on rebellion, expanded on murder, and enriched on the backs of uncompensated black men and women. Is that Godly? Biblical?  Right ? And you have the audacity to complain about a sexual publicity stunt? "That shouldn't happen in this Godly nation!"   Well, should that wonderfully moral forefather, Thomas Jefferson, have fathered children with his slave women? Would Jesus condone that? Would Jesus condone slavery? What about adultery? But Jefferson was justified, because he won. That's the way things work in America. He who wins writes the rules. What about righting the wrongs? Did anyone ever think about that? I suppose not. I suppose it was A-OK to screw Mexico out of territory its citizens rightfully owned. I suppose it was OK to annex Hawaii illegally. I suppose it was OK to lock Japanese-Americans up in internment camps during World War II. But a lesbian kiss!? On television? In this moral nation? It can't be!   That is why I say that our standard needs to be the Word of God. Populist morals will constantly be changing. What was permissible 50 years ago is not permissible today, and what is permissible today may not have been permissible 50 years ago and may not be permissible 50 years from now. Stop saying, "Why were the old days better than these?" It is not wise to ask such questions. Especially when the old days weren't that much better.   If we make our standard the Word of God, have an open mind because we only see in part, maybe we can begin to make relevant critiques of culture. I think, though, that if we hold our nation to that standard, it doesn't, and indeed never did, measure up. But that's the beauty of it. Christ didn't come to save "America" or "Tanzania" He came to save people. And if we can get our focus off man-made borders and political ideologies and begin to care about what Jesus cares about -  people  - we'll be living the way Christ intended us to.    (Now, if you were to make the case that  media  has declined from an ethical viewpoint in the past few years, that argument might hold some water. But media does not encompass the whole of society.)

        Jamie, the reason I rarely jump in the middle of these debates is because by the time I get around to reading it all, it becomes so muttled that I can't figure out what the origional point made was. Plus, all 3 of you guys are alot more politically and biblicaly intelligent than I am. I would most likely end up making points that have already been said in much higher vocabulary and just sound redundant.  But my opinion on "the shocking lesbian kiss", was it really that shocking? The way our media portrays sex these days, you're almost concidered not normal if you're a completly straight female. Either that, or you're just lying and denying if you claim to be completly heterosexual. But what can we do about it? Pray...seriously that's the only thing we really can do about it.....AND the whole foundation of homosexual acts is a spiritual thing, so praying would actually be more affective than protesting (yes I know that sounds completly hypocritical coming from the activist) But if we protest more against it, claiming it's vile and shouldn't be public like that, the church is just gonna be looked at as even more of a "hater". Cause as Jeff said, how can we expect non-christians to act christian?

      {sigh}  Let me start with Jeffs post.....Jeff:  "why do you continue to expect non-christians to act Christian" .   Umm...I don't.  I'm not sure what I said that made it look like that.  I'm not surprised at all.  I fully expect it.   Thats precisly what my post was about. We will see more and more of this in the future.  I expect that next year we will see even more "non-Christian" things on TV.  Jeff:  "As far as I know, girls kissing girls is not "illegal" in this country..."   No Jeff...I didn't say it was.    Jeff:  "Thats why our forfathers gave their lives. And that is why our troups are in Iraq - so that even Iraqi lesbians can kiss each other on Iraqi TV without recieving persecution. "   First off, you can disagree with military action, thats your business, but the way you mock those who don't is disapointing.  {sigh} And I am sorry you are so mistaken about why our forefathers gave their lives.  Providing for lesbian kissing has nothing to do with why the founders of this country came here.  For the sake of our country and the rest of the world, I hope this view is not a common one.  No one is talking about persecuting anyone....they have all the right in the world to kiss each other.  My post had nothing to do with this.  My post only mourned the fact that it has become acceptable.  You and Jon are so quick to jump down my back that you totally missed what I was saying.  Speaking of you, my dear friend Jon.....  :-) .....  Jon:  "Someone remind to correct Jamie in the error of his ways when I get a chance" .   I stand by every word that I said.  It is perfectly true to say that alot of our country's standards for morality have slipped over time.  My post simply mourned this.   It also challanged the church to stand up and say it is wrong.  I heard precious few christians stand up and say what happened on MTV was wrong.  I am sorry to tell you, but if a Christian stands up and calls sin to task, it is very likely that they will be margianalized and not looked at as "cutting edge". We will not always be able to be accepted in the worlds circles if we choose to stand up and say "that is a sin because the Bible ways so".   I am not sure what you have to attack in my post. I simply stated the fact that in increasing ways homosexuality is being accepted in our culture and that is unfortunate.  Then I chastized the church for not calling sin...sin.  I then said  "Pray for our country...we are the most influencial country on the planet, and MTV is the kind of crap that we are exporting around the world. Pray that the US will return to the beliefs that made it great."  Hmmm...I'm sorry to hear that you disagree with this, Jon.  Go to another country and you will very likely hear Brittany Spears blasting from radios everywhere.   I would have thought you too would be disapointed that this is what other countries see of us.  As I said before, you totally missed the entire point of what i was trying to say.  I certainly did not say that wringing our hands and whining was the way to fix it. Absolutely not.  Rather, Christians need to "infiltrate" ALL parts of culture....entertainment, government, business, etc....and stand up for truth...whether or not the world always thinks of us as "cutting edge".  Off to eat my lunch...in the 2 minutes I have left after writing this post....I think I have yogurt today....oh and peach pie..should be good.

      oh... that thing with kairsie and mel... it is so great.  I love it  oh... and I'd take the $115,000,000 and create a foundation.  Then id seriously pray really hard.  that kind of money (especially if people know you have it) is enough to destroy a person, and all of his closest relationships.  oh... and jamie on the lesbian kiss.... why do you continue to expect non-christians to act Christian?  why does it surprize you when the unsaved act unsaved.   As far as I know, girls kissing girls is not "illegal" in this country.  Thats why our forfathers gave their lives.  And that is why our troups are in Iraq - so that even Iraqi lesbians can kiss each other on Iraqi TV without recieving persecution.  but for those who have had a real encounter with Christ it is like "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will."  Rom 12:2 etc.

      "So how are we to bring the gospel to aboriginal natives without destroying them?"  1.  Do not kill them... duh 2.  Realize that God is bigger than mans traditions.  Recognize their traditions as long as they don't conflict with scriptures (like head hunting or something) 3.  Become like them. - the ultimate respect.  (most missionarys don't do this because they cant give up conveniences they are used to) 4.  Realize that Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness is not all that there is. 5.  Speak their mother tongue - their heart language.  if I had time, I would write more... i never said it was gonna be easy

      Glad my sister's having a good time.  I am too.  I was just reading in my history book (and I think I'm actually understanding it in a way that I'll remember it later!  PRAISE GOD!!!) and came across this quote from Cristoforo Colombo (aka Christopher Columbus) describing his first personal experiences with the native americans in the Bahamas:       "Monday, 12 November       They are very gentle and do not know what evil is; nor do they kill others, nor steal; and they are without weapons and so timid that a hundred of them flee from one of our men even if our men are teasing them.  And they are credulous and aware that there is a God in heaven and convinced that we come from the heavens;  and they say very quickly any prayer that we tell them to say, and they make the sign of the cross."  Now I know that some or all of you believe that our administration of culture to indigenous peoples across the world was of great benefit to those peoples, but when people are transformed from peace-lovers who "do not know what evil is" to warmongers, I find it hard to believe that such an impact on the part of European expansionists could be a positive one.  So how are we to bring the gospel to aboriginal natives without destroying them?

So anyway, let me just tell you how much fun the Schluter children are!  Um... I mean, teens and tweens.  Not children.  Whatever.  Anyway, their 'rents are away and I'm staying here with them and it is just way too much fun!  They are crazy, crazy kids, which makes me love them all the more!  Plus, Luda makes some pretty rockin' cookies.  PeeWee cookies.   'cept she calls them "PeeVee Cyookies."  It's great!  I want a Russian accent!  I figure that by the end of the week, I'll have it down.  On a sadder note, I miss my brother.  And his games.  But mostly my brother.  :)  *Sigh*  Kelly:  I'm all about visiting (of course) sometime soon.  Jesse recommended late October or November.  We'll see.  I need to figure out how I'm going to get off and who's going to come with me and how we're going to fit all those interested into my tiny little Civic.  The last time we were packed full with only three of us.  Hmm.... if lots of people are interested and are able to help split the cost, I'll look into renting a minivan or something.  Renting will be cheaper after January, though, when I'm....GASP!....twenty-freakin-five!  Dude.  I'm not really sure how I feel about that.  Kinda strange.  Not as freaked-out-in-a-bad-way as I thought I'd be.  The 20s rock, man.  Well.......I need to crash ( I stayed up way too late last night to finish my book!  I need to go to bed early on school nights in order to survive!).  Have a lovely Tuesday, my friends.  And just to clarify, I'm not anti-debate.  Not at all.

      oh my... i just discoverd some radical news   urlLink you can read more here   This is actual proof that the smurfs is actually COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA.  wow   "I like most of my generation grew up watching the Smurfs. I loved them so much that I tuned in every Saturday mourning to see what crazy hy-jinx those lovable little blue creatures would get up to. It is just now that I have realized what I was really tuning into each and every Saturday morning was in actuality Communist Propaganda!! Yes that is correct, Papa Smurf and all of his little smurf minions are not the happy little characters Hanna Barbara would have us believe! The cartoon was really created by the Russian government in order to indoctrinate the youngest members of western society with communist beliefs and ideals thus destroying their resistance to the imminent Russian invasion that was to occur when this generation (my generation) grew up. Looking back, our resistance was not destroyed (only our happy childhood memories) but only due to the determination of other cartoons such as G.I. Joe and Richie Rich who's goal it was to instill in the children of the western world the morals and values of Capitalism. "

I think you may be doomed as well... all it takes to rid the world of smurfs is some snow angels (or dirt angels if there is no snow)  Jaron is the master of dirt angels - or gravel angels.  Good luck jesse, I wish you the best, as you pretend to be smurfs... but pray you don't run into the real thing - it could be disasterous.

      Another quote from my history text, this time about the Society of Jesus in the mid-1500s:       "Ignatius [the founder of the Jesuits] required that members of the society, known as Jesuits, complete a rigorous and advanced education.  They receive instruction not only in theology and philosophy but also in classical languages, literature, history, and science.  As a result of this preparation - and their unswerving dedication to the Roman Catholic church - the Jesuits made extraordinarily effective missionaries.  They were able to out arguie most of their opponents and acquired a reputation for discipline and determination.  They often served as counselors to kings and rulers..."     This is what today's church need!  God's body needs people who are as dedicated to God as the Jesuits were to the Roman Catholic Church.  We need people who are willing not just to go to foreign countries, but to take the time and make the effort to prepare themselves and become effective missionaries.  Most people of this world are unwilling to listen to the uneducated, and believe it or not, the lack of an education (though not considered to be important to some) can create an impermeable barrier between the missionary and those in need.

      So I'm thinking about this "legislating morality" issue, and I think I'm opposed to the concept of making people behave "Christian" because it's the law. But when you take it one step past that, all law is an attempt for society to agree upon, and therefore legislate, that which is moral.     Law is defined as "A rule of conduct or procedure established by custom, agreement, or authority."  Morality is defined as "A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct."  We are looking at the same thing here. So what is a Christians role in working towards an agreed upon framework for right living as a whole society?   (Now I'm going to go burn Thomas Edison in effigy. Wicky-wicky.)

      the mennonite statement is not perfect... it needed more work, but as I understand it, didn't have time to go through the whole thought process.  98% of the thing is good. - we need to acknowledge that  Can/should we legislate morality?   What did Jesus have to say about the Law?  How far does that go?   I believe it is best to not legislate morality as long as it is personal...  for example censorship or things with consenting adults... something like that.  BUT when it comes to affecting someone else, (like killing them) well then I think we should have some laws against it.    I suggest that the mennonite statement is flawed, and probably not intentionally flawed as much as sloppily flawed due to the lack of time.   I just read the whole thing here  urlLink http://www.mennoniteusa.org/NewItems/delegates/statement_abortion.pdf   I agree with about 157 out of 160 lines...and I was actually surprized how thoughtful and not typical Christian.  It addresses hard questions and doesn't necissarily give all the answers.  I particularly liked the one section   "Human life begins at conception.  We agree that any attempt to define the beginning of humanness at a point along the spectrum of development is a mistake, tempting as it may be."   I've been asking myself that question for a while... when do we become human? (different from animals)  This statement assures me that it is too hard a question to answer.  I guess I can live with that - although my mind would like a more concrete answer.    this would be a good discussion for my bible study I think...  We could study the scriptures and see what the bible says on all this stuff...

      Jamie freakin' Detweiler. Your powers of projection (The attribution of one's own attitudes, feelings, or suppositions to others) and assumption never cease to amaze me.   Did the people protesting look like bigoted idiots? Quoting from CNN - "A black student filed a complaint with SMU, saying the sale was offensive. SMU officials said they halted the event after 45 minutes because it created a potentially unsafe situation." Hmm. Someone thought they were being bigots. I clearly think they were being idiots.   "Another point that comes to mind...no where in the article does it state the the [sic] race of the protestors...You ASSUMED they are all white..." Really? I did? This is where that whole "projection" thing comes into play. Read my post. Did I ever say they were white? The word "white" occurs exactly twice in my post - both times being quoted by CNN, speaking of the pricing structure. So who's the one doing the assuming here? It certainly isn't me.   And were they Republican? Who else in Texas would be considered a "Young Conservative"? And, from the article, "Similar sales have been held by College Republican chapters at colleges in at least five other states since February." Yes, I know that statement doesn't identify the party affiliations of the SMU students, but it clearly paints the picture. And was it a Democratic or Republican president who filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court opposing affirmative action? I can't recall. My liberal brain, oh so long on opinions but woefully short on facts has failed me again.   I am blown away by the fact that you felt a need to combat my post. It was facts and questions with a minute amount of editorializing. You must be so insecure in your worldview that when you see something even remotely critical of something you think you might agree with but aren't sure you just race to its defense. Why would you do that? You missed the entire point of my post -  Who bought the cookies, and what does that teach us about affirmative action?    Here's a clue - there are only two possible solutions, and both are rather interesting.   Oh, nevermind. Quick, to the Rhetoric Mobile! Someone is asking intelligent questions! We can't be expected to come up with  answers , so let's just become indignant and make fun of liberals! Rush agrees with it, so it must be right!

      In response to Jon's blog. Read it  urlLink here   A few things in response to this....  Quote from Jon's blog: "The Young Conservatives of Texas organized the sale as a protest of affirmative action, but instead just looked like bigoted idiots."  Hey Jon....the purpose of the protest was to get nationwide news coverage of their issue. IT WORKED! The purpose was to have blogs all over the country talking about them and their issue....IT WORKED! Both you and Kelly are talking about it, and now its on the Random blog too!  They didn't do the bake sale to raise money for thier compassion child sponsorship or something....they did it to GET NOTICED....I'd say it came off exactly as they hoped!  :-) I don't think they really care if a liberal democrat in Reading, PA things they are bigots.  Second Quote: "According to CNN, "A sign said white males had to pay $1 for a cookie. The price was 75 cents for white women, 50 cents for Hispanics and 25 cents for blacks.""  Jon...I would have thought you would have applauded this pricing structure....  Another point that comes to mind...no where in the article does it state the the race of the protestors...You ASSUMED they are all white... Hmm....you assume a conservative group is made up of all white males. That is as much a false stereotype as what you accuse others of, my friend. What if the group was made up of both African-Americans, Latino's and Caucasions.  There are MANY minorities who despise affirmative action and the "victim" mentality it propagates.  Third Quote: "Now, assuming the Young Conservatives stuck to their prices (which is a fair assumption - they're Republican)"  I thought you knew better then that, Jon....It didn't say anywhere in the article that they were Republicans....it said they were conservatives!  I wouldn't have thought I would have had to tell you, but there is many times QUITE a difference. Well, but that's a liberal for you...plenty of opinions, usually a little short on the facts.... ;-)   [The preceding smily face was for those out there who can't take intelectual disagreement. For those of you who fit that description as well as the voters of Florida, here is the more literal translation, from the original Latin....."I don't hate Jon.  I think he is way wrong on a lot of things, but I don't hate him." If you still have questions call Rev. Al Sharpton...he'll have a support group for you.]  Well...it would seem the Young Conservatives of Texas suceeded at their goal with flying colors.  They got a liberal from Reading, PA help get out their message...Impressive my young conservative friends, impressive.

       Several men are in the locker room of a golf club. A cell phone on a bench rings and a man engages the hands-free speaker function and begins to talk. Everyone else in the room stops to listen.  Man: "Hello?" Woman: "Honey, it's me. Are you at the club?"  Man: "Yes." Woman: "I am at the mall now and found this beautiful leather coat. It's only $1,000. Is it okay if I buy it, sweetie?"  Man: "Sure... go ahead if you like it that much. I want you to be happy."  Woman: "I also stopped by the Mercedes dealership and saw the new 2003 models. I saw one that I really liked. It's a beautiful silver."  Man: "How much?"  Woman: "$60,000" Man: "Okay, but for that price I want it with all the options."  Woman: "Great! Oh, and just one more thing... the house we wanted last year is back on the market. They're asking $950,000."  Man: "Wow, then go ahead and make them an offer, but just offer $895,000."  Woman: "Okay. Thank you darling -- you're wonderful! I'll see you later! I love you!"  Man: "Bye, I love you too."  The man hangs up. The other men in the locker room are looking at him in astonishment.  Then he asks: "Anyone know who this phone belongs to?"

      Jon, oooh pick me pick me, i would love to come, "blasting with both barrels in defense of highly educated Christians"..... it is an important discussion. God calls individuals into higher educations for his purposes just as much as he called others into the mission field or other occupations. i think the important part is that for too long Christian have stayed away from higher education - excluding theology and divinity studies. part of this avoidence is the fact that Christians have not been involved in fields such as medical science and research, and when they have they voice some obsurd opinions and fail to show the love of Christ through their intellectuality. therefore making it harder for other Christians to make in roads in these intellectual areas, and even be taken seriously. God has given some people amazing understanding of different fields and those people can impact a larger community of secular intellectuals that laymen may not be able to because of his inablity to speak the same language....   i have lots more to say on this issue, but alas i must get back to the Library to work on my Sr. Thesis... sounds impressive huh?! :)

      Jesse, Jamie,  Good points. Os Guinness writes "We evangelicals need to examine our anti-intellectualism, confess its pervasiveness, repent of its wrongness and seek God's restoration to live up to our name--truly believing people of the gospel who love God not only with our hearts, soul and strength, but also with our minds... Thus, if we take the commands of Jesus seriously, we cannot dismiss the charge of anti-intellectualism as elitism or intellectual snobbery. As God has given us minds, we can measure obedience by whether we are loving Him with those minds, and disobedience by whether we are not."  Jesse said "Most people of this world are unwilling to listen to the uneducated, and believe it or not, the lack of an education (though not considered to be important to some) can create an impermeable barrier between the missionary and those in need." I see your point. But what about this? Acts 4:13 reads "When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus." Interesting. The intellectual shortcomings of Peter and John pointed those around them to the source of all truth, the source of all learning, Jesus himself. I would much rather people see that  I have been with Jesus  than see a Masters of Divinity from Yale or a PhD from Oxford. I would be content with a one page Curricula Vitae - Jon Carlson has been with Jesus. Now, I don't believe the two are mutually exclusive. Intelligent people can be with Jesus. But where does the emphasis lie?   One more verse - Ecc. 12:11b "Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body."

      oh... and on my political beliefs...  smaller less intrusive government is better government - thats a clearly republican idea - and sort of the reason that America was invented.  And so in general, I support the Republican party.  Both parties support killing.  One supports killing the unborn, the other supports killing mean people, and innocent people in other countries.  They are both wrong so that cancels out the issue of "killing" as a way for me to pick a policital party.  Democrats try to take more of my money to waste on stuff.  At least the republicans try to let local governments make more of those important decisions.

Jesse - besides the fact that you are an orange alien with green antennea with a big butt... the reason your butt is so big is that you are full of crap.  Jon never said on his blog that he agreed with or believes the news media "scandals."  Maybe he found them ironic.

      Yay!  Hey Everyone, if you'll check Jon's blog for yesterday, you'll discover that Jon believes EVERYTHING he reads in the media.

      Dangit, I just don't check this blog often enough!  I soooo would have loved to do some special editing to some posts... lets see if i can find them:  Jon-  - Don't argue too much. Kaiser Blog Nazi Wilhelm Jesse IV will think you're actually upset and begin to get very angry and tell you not to post such things. So when you're explaining to Jamie why exactly he's wrong, at least try to be funny about it.   becomes   - Don't be mean. We love and honor Kaiser Blog Nazi Wilhelm Jesse IV because he is looking out for our well being and the healthiness of our relationships.  We should be courteous when we discuss things so that we don't hurt peoples feelings while we make our point.  Jesse was absolutely right in this request, so let's honor it.   AND  Rebecca:  "I hope I do a good job and even if I don't, I bet it's good enough for government work. :) About the pointers - Blog Nazi Jesse won't censor me because he loves me too much. Plus, he likes to flirt with my younger sister and he can't do that if he's angered me. "  becomes  "I hope I do a good job and even if I don't, I bet it's good enough for government work. :) About the pointers - Blog Nazi Jesse won't censor me because he loves me too much. Plus, my younger sister is in love with him, so I wouldn't say anything to upset him anyway."   So yeah, as long as you blog frequently enough, none of your posts get edited.  How's THAT for incentive?   By the way, i need a major change.   Like, not just some random big change, but a change in my major.  According to a test I took yesterday in Bio, I suck at that class.  Maybe I should switch to communications and do video editing, etc.  :)

      Ok Jon - must you always bring up facts?  It is really quite tedious.... :)  What makes you think I'm not in the Bush camp?  I am and quite firmly.... so that makes two based on my previous comments about Amanda...sorry.... As far as my sister I should have been more specific about which younger sister Jesse flirts with. Allison is the lucky winner of his flirtatious comments however, Karen is the one that you know and she is doing well.  She's currently a junior at Kutztown, studying telecommunications.  Really likes what she is studying and also enjoys the challenge of being a Christian at a public school. I have her e-mail if you wanted to know more about what she's up to but I won't bore people about someone they don't even know....although it is supposed to be random - would updating someone on a stranger qualify as random or just annoying?  I'm choosing to ignore the Republican comment (based on the fact that a Democrat I know of didn't know about the definition of the word "is". Granted, it is a tricky word, easily confused with sooo many other two-lettered words.)   The objectivity thing is a good question and as I'm really tired right now, I can't do it justice.  With that disclaimer, I would lean to the side that it doesn't exist save in things that are factual.  But then we get off into another whole philosophical discussion about the true nature of reality (kinda Plato-esque discussion as seen in his analogy of people watching shadows on a wall and thinking it is real life....that was Plato right? Please objectively correct my errors of fact if you chance upon one ;) )   I must go to bed....very sleepy and I still want to read my most recent book purchase - DESIRING GOD by John Piper.  Has anyone read it?  What did you think of it? It was recommended to me by no less than 3 people so I decided to begin it.  Really begin to get into it at the beach last week - really insightful stuff.  I think the guy is on to something.....

      Uxorious was Dictionary.com's Word of the Day for Monday September 29, 2003.   "I've hared taht you can mix up the ltetres in a wrod and as lnog as the fsrit and lsat lertets are the smae, you can sltil raed it." That's really freakin' funny. Speaking of your sister, how is she doing? Still doing the whole video thing?   According the Associated Press, as of July 19th, "Since President Bush launched his bid for re-election on May 16, his campaign has raised at least $41.4." Hmm. That's a lot of money for someone to win an unopposed primary. And it's great that you tell Amanda how to vote - now we have another one in the Anyone But Bush camp! :)   And grammar, pronunciation, and syntax don't matter for you - you work for a Republican.   I would base objectivity on the definition of it - "Uninfluenced by emotions or personal prejudices." I think it doesn't exist. Does anyone disagree with me?

Jon - Thanks for the permission to waste your money.... I hope I do a good job and even if I don't, I bet it's good enough for government work. :) About the pointers - Blog Nazi Jesse won't censor me because he loves me too much.  Plus, he likes to flirt with my younger sister and he can't do that if he's angered me.  As for spelling, I've hared taht you can mix up the ltetres in a wrod and as lnog as the fsrit and lsat lertets are the smae, you can sltil raed it. What do you think......seems to work for some people all the time. :)  About Bush, I think you're are assuming something.... I don't remember him announcing that he is running for a second term. :)  Oh, about your statement, "Objectivity is a myth."  I don't think that I can answer that because objectivity means different things to different people.  How do you mean it in this instance?  If I know that maybe I can give you my opinion or maybe not....  Kairsie - I'm not sure if you are the only one on this blog who doesn't know me but that's OK. I'm connected through Amanda who has been a best friend of mine since high school.  We are very different types of people but I love her for it.  She gets on my case because of my bad grammar (such as when I pronounce the word "nuclear" wrong) and I get on her for knowing next to nothing about things political.  I have to tell her how to vote..... it gives me a little power trip, mini-dictator Bec.

Bush  hmmmm not an act of terrorism?  hmmm  ok  Ninety eight percent of the adults in this country are decent, hardworking, honest Americans. It's the other lousy two percent that get all the publicity. But then, we elected them. --Lily Tomlin  People freakin gave their life so we could complain.  And now you want to take that "God given" right away from us?  Well is it worth fighting for, or dying for?  So I will fight and picket for my girl to be able to make any statement she wants about Bush, and on top of that, you will sit there and listen to it!  OR ELSE.  OR ELSE  or else you can ummm move to freakin Germany.  now see if you can tell when im sarcastic and when im not  ha...    This country is going to hell in a handbasket, and what we really need is change.

      "...And if Bush gets re-elected, I'm moving to Germany."  Kairsie, i am by no means a avid Bush supporter, but honestly, people making statements like that is really frustrating. many people had made that statement when Bush got elected, they were going to move to another country, and guess what, they are  still  here. I personally believe if an individual is going to make a statement like that then they damn well better follow through! too many times people make that type of statement lightly, in an effort to show how supportive (or unsupportive depending on your perspective) they are and that they are truly serious about what they believe etc. but in the end, it just shows that they really are not as convicted about the cause as they want everyone to think, because the thing they said they were gonna do, yeah they didn't do it.... so if come November we see Bush get re-elected, shall i come over and help you pack for your new life over in Germany?  I don't mean to sound harsh, but that statement is one of my pet peeves!! i mean if you truly are going to do what you say then good, if not, then don't say it at all...

      Bec, it's OK to waste our tax dollars. Every dollar that goes to you is a dollar that didn't go to kill some poor bloke in Iraq or Afghanistan or any of the myriad other nations my tax dollars have helped decimate. By the way, welcome to our discussion. Just some pointers:  - Don't argue too much. Kaiser Blog Nazi Wilhelm Jesse IV will think you're actually upset and begin to get very angry and tell you not to post such things. So when you're explaining to Jamie why exactly he's wrong, at least try to be funny about it.   - Be prepared for this blog to stagnate for long periods of time. It will come back.  - Watch your spelling and grammar. Especially if you are complaining about someone else's blatant ignorance of the English language. (And yes, I know that was a sentence fragment.)  - Vote Anyone But Bush in 2004  And I think that should do it.   So based on what you've said about worldviews, would you agree with the statement "Objectivity is a myth."? Just curious.

      Actually Mandi - I figured it out all by myself and will no longer be needing your services. The thought of "taking advantage" hadn't even entered my innocent mind but now a seed has been planted....   And, since we are on the topic of my name (which really isn't a big deal - having five siblings I've learned to respond to almost anything, usually unkind....) I feel some clarification is needed.... Mandi is right in that she calls me Bec, much of the world calls me Becky BUT my aunt and grandfather call me Becca and I use Rebecca when signing my name.  So there you have it - in case you were interested.  Jamie - the worlview thing - I agree with you that knowing someone's tendency to either the left or right side of the political continuum does not necessarily determine their party.  (Is that what you were saying?) However, that wasn't my point.  I simply meant that for anyone, your worldview will be evident in/effect every area of life, political affliations included.  I remember in one of poli-sci classes in college we were to write our worldview and test it against a current political problem.  It was one of the most rewarding assignments I've ever done.  You all should try it.  Maybe we can grade them then and determine if your worldview passes. ;) Gotta get back to work - I'm wasting all your tax dollars....

      Before I begin, let me just establish that this is, in fact, me.  The one and only.  Man...I hope Bec doesn't take advantage of having my blog password.  It's bad enough knowing that Jesse can "edit" my posts....  Anyway, Jamie:  It's Becky, not Becca.  But really, it's Bec.  Others:  Okay...so here's a pretty random thing that happened to me this week.  My dad set me up on a date.....and it WASN'T with Matt! :)  Okay...so it wasn't a date AT ALL, but it still cracks me up.  My dad is such a nut.  So anyway, I went to this Justice & Mercy banquet last night at Yoders (Man, I am totally NOT a dutchy-food lovin' kind of girl!), and I thought it was going to be totally boring.  It was, however, quite informative, and even enjoyable.  FYI Bec- I was in the room with many-a-politician...maybe some of their politicalishness has soaked in.  :)  Perhaps there is hope for me yet! :)  I LOVE the word "catastrophe!"  ...and catastrophic is even more fun to say!  Oh, by the way....I'm baaaaaack.  You may now rejoice with overwhelming gladness.  :)  Oh, and....I'M GOING TO BOSTON!  I'M GOING TO BOSTON!  I'm so excited, because I'M GOING TO BOSTON!

      Well, unless I am mistaken, I believe the post below by 'Bec' was the first of hers on this fair blog of ours.  I'd like to be the first to extend a welcome to our new neighbor on the block.  However, I had to look twice as it appeared our new neighbor busted on our blog as well as on our ears, which as far as mine go, cetainly are not deaf.  :)  So, welcome to the block, Becca, and we would welcome anything you have to add to our discussion.  By the way, Becca, it was nice to meet you the other week at Zion.  You and your family are, or course, welcome at any time.  In response to your post, I would make a small distinction....I would argue that being a political conservative is not an "affiliation".  It is quite differnt then being a Republican or Libertarian or something.  I would rank being a political "conservative" or "liberal" as a bit higher then a given party affiliation.  I have yet to decide what part it plays in my worldview.

      I've been wanting to respond to whole bunch of the things you all said on this sucker of a blog but didn't..... it takes alot of time I think and I'm not sure that it is always worth it because I don't want to just spew forth and have it fall on deaf ears.....wow, run on.  This is Bec not Amanda just so you all know.... can't figure out why I can't work the blog on my computer at work....any suggestions?  Anyway - that's not important now.... I think Jamie and Jon (although I know very little about either of you) that you really hit on some key points in the political debate and ones that are NEVER going to be resolved.  And, honestly, do we really want them to?  It is sooo much fun to disagree! :)  But the key I think is the worldview thing that you briefly hit on Jamie.  I think that political affiliations are the result of your worldview not a worldview in itself.  A worldview (sick of the word yet?) is a framework through which you filter your world.  It is intensely individual and above categorizing.  In a way, it takes your empirical world and runs it through your normative framework to see how things line up.  Anyway - simply my humble opinion - take it or leave it.  It is frustrating to me to see inconsistency in people's worldviews even though there are some in my own. For example, the issue of human life.  I am deeply committed to the principle of protecting the innocent life of the unborn but don't find such vehemence in myself when it involves the capital punishment of an innocent individual.  Maybe it is the incapablity of the unborn to defend themselves but when it occurs to an adult I kinda think, "Wow, that's a bummer. But win some lose some.....".  Almost embarrassed to write it.... more later maybe but my hands are too cold to type....perhaps time to turn the heat on....

      Confluence. Coda. Comeuppance.   And Jamie, I never leveled charges of racism. There's that projection again. I simply pointed out bigoted actions. Apparently it was problematic enough for the university to shut it down.   I never said that these students  were  bigoted or racist rednecks. I said that their  actions  gave the  appearance  of that. There's a big difference. I'm sure they had the best of intentions. But there are better ways of making a point so that you don't alienate the very people you allegedly are trying to help. I never said that I support affirmative action. I think this cookie sale provides a good jumping off point for having that discussion. I'm working on it, but haven't finished it enough to post it on my blog. Oh, BTW, thanks for the link to Dennis Kucinich's home page. I'd been looking for that. :)

      Jon....I disagree with your logic in in the following instances...  Your post said,  ....they "instead just looked like bigoted idiots."  You assume that because 1 black student filed a complaint, that somehow that clearly gives proof of racism...   Hardly. It gives reason to examine it closer, but not proof.  Because someone thought it does not make it true.  "And were they Republican? Who else in Texas would be considered a "Young Conservative"? " - Jon....there are quite a few people who are conservative that are not Republican.  There are also quite a few people that call themselves Republican that ARE NOT conservatives.  In this story, it is possible that many of them happened to be registered Republican, but to assume that it was a group of Republicans is incorrect.  Being a Republican is simply a political affiliation. Conservatism could almost be called a world view...Hmmm, actually, I will have to think about that statement...would political "conservatism" and "liberalism" be termed "world views".  Maybe they are parts of my world view...Hmmm, interesting question....thoughts anyone? What is the definition of a "world view"?  Can I have more then one "world view"?   "Yes, I know that statement doesn't identify the party affiliations of the SMU students, but it clearly paints the picture."  This is exactly the reasoning you  disagree with  in your statement:  "This is where that whole "projection" thing comes into play. Read my post. Did I ever say they were white?"   No, you didn't "say" it , but my friend you didn't have to....it came through loud and clear.   No, Jon, I didn't miss the entire point of your post, rather I responded to the underlying assumptions that I read in your post. I was responding to this paragraph...  "And people wonder why I'm a registered Democrat. The Young Conservatives of Texas organized the sale as a protest of affirmative action, but instead just looked like bigoted idiots."  I didn't race to defend affirmative action.  I admit, I did allow my view of affirmative action to creep in at one point, but that was not the purpose for my reply.  Rather,  I wanted to challenge the view that somehow one is a bigot if one questions the policy of affirmative action.  When I read the post, it said to me that if you disagree with affirmative action as the way to fix the racial problems we have in this country that some how it makes you a racial bigot.  I don't know if affirmative action is the best way to solve racial injustices in our country.   Show me that it is and I'll probably support it, but at this point, the point has not been proved to me.  In fact, I wonder if it doesn't hurt more then helps...  And finally, the following quote from Jon's blog:  "Rush agrees with it, so it must be right!"  I never thought I'd see the day....!!! ;-)  I'll get back to you with the answer to your other question just as soon as I can find my calculator....

      Mmm... cookies...  As for my sister (who apparently has a very hard time collecting her thoughts into one post within 8 minutes but instead splits them into four instead of simply editing her previous post)... you can feel free to use my scanner if you can figure out how to get it working again.  We haven't been using it at home (unless our mother and father have begun scanning your baby pictures and plastering them all over the internet again), maybe you should ask dad if you can take it to your house while I'm not there.    No problem with the format change... I know it was a simple thing, but I take joy in being able to figure such things out when I know so little about HyperText Markup Language...  I might have a friend tutor me in programming, and then I'm sure I'll get all sorts of computer languages mixed up!  Ich habe   tu madre.     Blogger Death Toll: Carrie n Becky Jeff (?)

      Just passing along something that gave me a good laugh....long but I think it is worth it....  WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD?   GEORGE W. BUSH  We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We  just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The  chicken is either with us or it is against us. There is no middle ground  here.  AL GORE  I invented the chicken. I invented the road. Therefore, the chicken  crossing the road represented the application of these two different   functions of government in a new, reinvented way designed to bring  greater  services to the American people.  RALPH NADER  The chicken's habitat on the original side of the road had been  polluted by unchecked industrialist greed. The chicken did not reach the  unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by  the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV.  PAT BUCHANAN To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American.  RUSH LIMBAUGH I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet it was  getting  a government grant to cross the road, and I'll bet someone out there is  already forming a support group to help chickens with  crossing-the-road  syndrome. Can you believe this? How much more of this can real Americans  take? Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax dollars, and when I  say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took  from you to build roads for chickens to cross.  MARTHA STEWART No one called to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a   standing order at the farmer's market to sell my eggs when the price   dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider   information.  JERRY FALWELL Because the chicken was gay! Isn't it obvious? Can't you people see the  plain truth in front of your face? The chicken was going to the "other  side." That's what they call it -- the other side. Yes, my friends, that  chicken is gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I  say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the  liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like "the other  side."  DR. SEUSS Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes, The  chicken crossed the road, But why it crossed, I've not been told!  ERNEST HEMINGWAY (my personal favorite....) To die. In the rain. Alone.  MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads  without  having their motives called into question.  GRANDPA In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told  us  that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough for us.  BARBARA WALTERS Isn't that interesting? In a few moments we will be listening to the  chicken tell, for the first time, the heart-warming story of how it   experienced a serious case of molting and went on to accomplish its   life-long dream of crossing the road.  JOHN LENNON Imagine all the chickens crossing roads in peace.  ARISTOTLE It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.  KARL MARX It was a historical inevitability.  SADDAM HUSSEIN This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in   dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.  VOLTAIRE I may not agree with what the chicken did, but I will defend to the  death  its right to do it.  RONALD REAGAN What chicken?  SIGMUND FREUD The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road  reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.  BILL GATES I have just released eChicken 2003, which will not only cross roads, but  will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook -  and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.  ALBERT EINSTEIN Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the   chicken?  BILL CLINTON I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by chicken?  Could you define chicken, please?   THE BIBLE And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken, "Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much  rejoicing.  COLONEL SANDERS I missed one?

      Jesse - thanks for the crash course in political philosophy.  I think I heard Locke and Rousseau mentioned once or twice during my  FOUR YEARS  of studying political science....   As far as the independent comment,  you missed my point.  Thankfully, Jon picked it up.  I was referring to the fact that in the primaries you, depending on the state you are registered in, are subject to the stipulations of a closed, open or blanket primary.  I like to vote in the primary as I feel it is hypocritical of me to not vote, so I registered with a party. So there you have it...

      Bec, correct me if I'm putting words in your mouth.   I believe what she was referring to, Jesse, is the fact that a registered independent disenfranchises his or herself in the primary. Some people really like to vote in primaries, and opening them up as a free-for-all would not work at all because you'd have a bunch of Republicans going out and voting for Al Sharpton in the primary just to watch him get trashed by Bush in '04. It's actually the independently minded thinkers that determine who wins most elections. Nationwide, our country is has a fairly equal percentage of people who vote straight party ticket for both Republicans and Democrats. These votes effectively cancel each other out. That means that those who aren't entrenched in party politics are determining the elections. But a registered independent still doesn't get to vote in the primaries.   Way to go with busting out the political philosophers around at the start of the Revolution. Most impressive.   I think Rousseau was full of crap, though, believing that personal property is the root of all social evils. Man's intrinsic sinfulness is the root of all social evils. You can take away my ability to own anything, and I will still be a sinful man acting in sinful ways. Christian's, I believe, should move towards the direction of forsaking all material claims (not that I have already achieved this, because I haven't...). But the entire world can't, and even if we did, we wouldn't solve anything.   The concept of ownership and dominion comes from God.   GE 1:28 God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground."          GE 1:29 Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. [30] And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground--everything that has the breath of life in it--I give every green plant for food." And it was so.  And it was so. And then we owned stuff.

      I wonder how many girls pretend to like sports just to spend "quality" time with their boyfriends?  I hate how blogger and google and somehow easily confusable in my mind, resulting in mistyped URLs when going to either.  If you can't tell, i'm in a very bloggery mood tonight.  This is caused by one thing, which I will number for the sake of absurdity (sake is also a Japanese alcohol made from fish):  5. I'm avoiding the commencement of writing my history paper.  I'm going to bed now.  After I do pushups.  And talk to my sister.  And put on music.

      Quoting Rebecca:  "3. If being an independent wasn't so useless and limiting, I think I would be one."  Maybe a correct revision of this statement would read as follows:  "If independents in America weren't so insecure and cowardly, they might have power."  How many other people feel exactly the same way you do, Bec?  How many other people would vote independently and break out of the supposedly inescapable bipartisan system if they knew they were supported by a multitude (plethora, menagerie- Just for Kelly so she still reads the RG) of like-minded people?  It was said about slavery, ecological conservation, and SpongeBob Squarepants that it begins with one person, one voice, one small viral cell among millions of white t-cells.  What has this theory brought to our country?  Slavery is now abolished, though it was said that it could never be done (and some believe that our capitalist society is just as bad, but we'll put that aside for now.).  Ecological conservation, though not having been fully acheived, is now a common topic of discussion and American thought.  (I just realized I hate the word American.  I also realized that I may be ruining my point with all these parenthetical sidenotes)  And SpongeBob?  Well, SpongeBob is SpongeBob, and he lives in a pineapple under the sea.  So why can't it be possible to breakfree of the mindset that an independent vote is flushed down the drain?   Also, you guys talk about the belief of minimalist government like the republicans or democrats are the first to present this idea.  I think you need to consult the ideas of the French philosophe Jean-Jacques Rouseau and the English theorist John Locke.  Both believed that, when it comes to government, "less is more."    Rouseau also proposed the idea that "personal property is the root of all social evils."  I find this statement highly intriguing and somewhat appealing.  Could it be that if there were no property, "social evils" would be abolished?  Thinking about such a thing would require quite a stretch of the imagination, ya?  Now this may seem communist, but I think if you can think about it the way I'm thinking about it, it's not.  No personal property, not even belonging to the government (which Rouseau proposes would be unnecessary.).  A possible qualm with this theory, though, is that we, as humans, somehow have an innate need for ownership.  We feel that it is our right to own  something .  But this could easily be chalked up to a cultural theme, something bestowed upon us by our parents and society.  Nature vs. Nurture if you will.

      Jon - couple of things which will in no way deal thoroughly with the issue you brought up but popped up into my head while reading it....  1. You are using President Bush as the one and only example of Republican thought.  I think that is a mistake.  True he does hold the highest position that a member of either party can aspire to but it doesn't thereby follow that he entails the entire belief system of that party.  I interact with Republicans (some politicians, some not) on a daily basis who find the same inconsistency that you do in the Patriot Acts, NCLB legislation, etc. and they are frustrated too.    2. Political parties, if you go back in history, were created in order to help candidates win elections. (That is one of the reasons that their formation was feared by some of our "founding fathers"... man.... I hate that term!)  That is still their purpose today.  Therefore, they are going to lean (with in reason) to the side that they determine will yield them the most votes.  Example, the Patriot Acts. The thought behind them was to protect the U.S. which was a very popular idea in the year or so following 9/11 (despite the appearance of public opinion today).  So with an eye on the 2002 elections, the acts were introduced.  Politicians will frequently soften their ideals if it means getting re-elected.  Perhaps cynical, but true.  And I don't think that it is limited to one party or the other.   3. If being an independent wasn't so useless and limiting, I think I would be one. It happens fairly frequently at my job that people ask me what party I am from.  I rarely tell them what party I am from only that I am conservative.  They assume (rightly) that I am a Republican.  I think that they also think that that means Republican first, then conservative when in all actuality it is the reverse.

      A Treatise on the History and Policies of Major American Political Parties.   Jeff, I must correct you. Not in a effort to get you to change your voting habits, but simply because you and many others are misinformed. You said "[S]maller less intrusive government is better government - thats a clearly republican idea - and sort of the reason that America was invented." That is actually  not clearly a Republican idea. In today's political climate, most Republicans present themselves as supporters of small government and big business. Looking at our countrys history paints a different picture. According to Encarta, Democrats argued that the national government should do nothing the states could do for themselves, and the states nothing that localities could do. The partys supporters in this period included groups as diverse as southern plantation owners and immigrant workers in northern cities. They all had in common a dislike of government intervention in their lives. The Democrats opponents, the Whigs, on the other hand, believed in using governmental power to promote, regulate, correct, and reform. Thats a Democratic idea. States rights were actually one of the major causes of the Civil War. Democrats argued (against the Republican party of Abraham Lincoln) that each state should be given the choice of whether or not slavery should be legal in their jurisdiction, in addition to a myriad other things states should maintain authority over. Less government intrusion in everyday life. One can debate for an eternity who was right in this case, its irrelevant. What matters in our discussion is which party was arguing for what.   Since the ear of the New Deal, however, the party has been hijacked into a purveyor of big government and high taxes. You can see that the stance of a party changes over time, so party allegiance is somewhat handicapping to an individual, because what that party stands for will change over time.   All this is simply a history lesson, though, and it could be argued that this has little to do with the current state of affairs. So lets talk about today.   Modern Republicans have successfully presented themselves as fiscally conservative politicians who are only there to serve and want to make the government smaller and give more rights to people. This spin doesnt match up with reality. Who sponsored the PATRIOT Act, parts I and II? Republicans. Do these acts encroach on civil liberties? Clearly. Which party has taken the stance that dissent is terror? Republicans. No Child Left Behind? Interesting idea, but its big government interfering in the affairs of a state, and its put forth by a Republican president. Which party is supporting wire-taps on American citizens without the need for a court order? You get the picture. Republicans currently arent giving me or my state any more rights, they are making a larger,  more  intrusive government.   And lets look at taxes. People love to tout Bushs tax cuts, Hes giving our money back to us. But thats not really true. What hes doing is giving your  childrens  money to you. When President Bush came into office, the government had done something unimaginable. It had turned a profit. President Clinton, for all of his many shortcomings and failures, had managed to put the budget in such a shape that we had a $230 billion surplus. President Bush managed to turn that into a $500 billion deficit in just a few short years. How? By cutting your taxes. Well, thats a good thing, right? Not really. That $500 billion isnt going to just appear out of thin air. Someone is going to have to pay it. Democrats take money out of our pockets. Republicans take money out of our childrens pockets. That check you got in the mail from the IRS, Jeff? Maria will have to pay it back. With compounded interest. Because President Bush didnt cut spending. If he would do that, I would cheer. But hes increased the Pentagons budget (why?). And hes spending $167 billion (on top of the deficit!) to fight a war that most of this country and most of the world opposes. Is that a smaller, less intrusive government that leaves more money in the hands of its citizens? No.    Democrats used to leave my money alone. Now they take my money and do (arguably) good things with it, social programs, etc.   Republicans used to take my money. Now they take my childrens money and use it to kill people.

      All right Mandi and Jon - OUCH!  Really I can handle it that you don't like the website I designed...really.  It doesn't hurt a bit. It is an extremely rude comment and one not easily forgotten. It is extremely unfortunate that you don't recognize Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y when you see it. But I will forgive you in time............. OK you're forgiven because I have nothing to do with the website... big shocker considering I can't even figure out how to create a link in my post.    But seriously - our chief of staff works on it when he gets the chance which isn't very often.  There is one provided by the majority caucus which is better ( urlLink www.samrohrer.com ) (darn I'm good! ) but we can't put anything campaign related on it so we created an alternative one.  If anyone wants to help out with the crappy one (you know, as a campaign donation... ;) ) that'd be fantastic, just let me know.    And Amanda dear, you really shouldn't go volunteering people... it isn't done in polite company.

Who says I was going to "attack [your] character or political affiliations"? You know what happens when you ass-u-me."  Okay, kids.  So who agrees (Jamie?) that it's somewhat laughable that JON'S telling ME not to ass-u-me?!  :)  Anyway, Jon...I'm glad we discussed the you being dumb comment.  Just remember that I was in a pretty silly mood when I blogged that and it was in no way intended as an actual observation of your intelligence..... :)  I'm a nice blogger.

I second Jeff's comment about both parties being for murder.  Republicans may be more likely to be pro war, but I suspect more people have died anyway from abortion than war, so I don't have much respect for Democrats in general either.  I can not fathom ever supporting someone who fights for partial birth abortion to be a "free right."  It's barbaric, and anyone who supports it is also barbaric.

      Let me just tell you that I got to experience one of my favorite parts of my job yesterday.  My boss was invited to the opening of the VIVA restaurant (actually doesn't open until 10/9 so I don't know what we were invited to.... a test run I guess).  He couldn't go so his greedy staff members snatched up the invitation.  It is a really neat place that has Mediterranean style food and live jazz every night.  Fun stuff!  But the best part was the food.... I could choose from every section of the menu.  I got an appetizer and then soup and then bread and then the salad so by the time the meal came I wasn't even hungry.  But having anticipated this before I even started, I had ordered with "leftover potential" in mind (knowing that my family would want to sample whatever I got). So I ordered shrimp stuffed with crab imperial - SO GOOD!  And then I got dessert and a latte (that really put me over the edge.) I felt a little dumb taking all this food home because I hadn't had to pay for any of it.... but then I saw a state senator leaving with his leftovers. I thought if he can do it, so can I.  So we put down our tip, grabbed our bags of leftovers and left.  The best part is that I got this incredible meal for free.  I LOVE FREE STUFF!! That's the moral of the story - well, I'll rephrase it.  Cheap is good, free is best.  Just call me Aesop.

      Perhaps I should rephrase what I mean.  Fire alarms should never be tested at 8:30 in the morning when the sole purpose is to see if the alarm works, not to see wether the people can get out of the building quickly.  And, if a fire alarm had to be so tested at 8:30a.m., there must be adaquate and timely notice.  A bad example of this is a silent phone message sent at 7:30 that very morning explaining to the residents that they should ignore the fire alarm unless it goes out for 10 minutes, b/c maintenance is testing to see if the fire alarm itself works.  Now, this is a bad example of proper notice mainly b/c anyone sleeping at 8:30, who wakes up to a fire alarm, is not going to check their voicemail before rushing out of the building in a sleepy stupor, mind you, all the way down from the floor fourth.

      dude.  can you all just STOP attacking everyone's (mainly mine) grammar?!  thank you.  pretty soon no one will post for fear of having one's mistakes pointed out for all to see.  besides, sometimes people just don't care.  (i'm all about proper grammar, but not necessarily on a freakin' blog!)

         Who gets to go to heaven?   One day two people die and are standing at the gates of heaven waiting to be judged. One is an elderly nun, who was raised in the church and spent her whole life in ministry. The other is a teenaged boy, who was an athiest.  As they stand before the gates, Jesus approaches them, and tells them with sadness that they only have room for one more person in heaven.  The nun falls to her knees and exclaims "Oh most holy king! I have been your servent all my life. I attended church every sunday, yet I still am not worthy to enter your kingdom without your mercy" The young boy also falls to his knees and said "God? I never knew you. I haven't once stepped foot in church my whole life. Surely I don't deserve to enter your kingdom." Then God said "I have made my decision, Adam (the teenaged boy) you may enter" The nun stood up smiling and started walking towards the gates till she realized what God had said. "What!?" she exclaimed "God, I have no right to question your judgement, but I don't understand? I have done your work throughout my whole life. I prayed to you daily. I kept your holy day. God why was I not chosen?" God replied, "You were selfish in your work. You looked upon others as less than you. Your work was for the eliete. A begger once came up to you and you turned him away. You stayed shelterd inside your community. This young man has given freely to everyone he could in his short life. He gladly gave money to organizations, and helped out in local community services. He gave shelter to a homeless man, he bought another food. He went and visited the sick in the hospital. This young man never even knew me and yet did my will"

      Jamie, if there were a Nobel Prize for missing the point, you would be a hands down winner. In no way was my post advocating the procedure. I'm merely pointing out where so many of our problems come in - we don't use accurate language. We use inflammatory rhetoric. It doesn't help the debate move in a constructive fashion, it pours gasoline on the fire.   President Bush has used inaccurate, inflammatory language when referring to this procedure. He said, the bill would "protect infants at the very hour of their birth." If you paid attention to Senator Santorum's remarks in the debate, though, you would have heard him say the procedure was performed "at least 20 weeks, and in many cases, 21, 22, 23, 24 weeks [into pregnancy], and in rarer cases, beyond that." How long does a pregnancy last? 40 weeks. We're not "at the very hour" of birth. We're half way into a pregnancy. The procedure in question is an abortion that sort of looks like a birth, not a birth interrupted by an abortion. ( urlLink Slate.com )   Now, I'm not advocating abortion here. It's horrendous and it hurts women and propagates violence. It should be banned. What I'm saying is that since there is a high moral ground here, there shouldn't be a need to resort to such linguistic duplicity.

      Happy Friday to you all!!  Jon posted a dissertation on "partial birth abortion" on his blog.  Read it  urlLink here , and then return to read my response below.   You may be surprised to hear that I would agree with my friend on his first statement (The first casualty of an ideological conflict is always language.), however, perhaps not in the way that he had in mind.  One of the things we have indeed lost is accurate language.  Please read the following quote from my friend; So what do we term the medical procedure just banned in Congress? Is it partial-birth abortion? I don't think that's accurate terminology.  I respectfully and strongly disagree with this statement.  Allow me to explain.  He says: It's not a birth that's been interrupted  It most certainly is.  Your first description provided by the abortion doctor is NOT a partial birth abortion.  I wish you would accurately describe the procedure that you are referring to.  Please allow me to provide an accurate description of the procedure that was banned recently.  You will find that the term partial birth abortion is precisely the best way to describe the procedure.  Partial birth abortion:  The baby is partially delivered. Most of the baby is removed from the mother, but before ALL of the baby is removed, a sharp instrument is stabbed into the back of the babys head and its brains are sucked out with a vacuum tool.  This kills the baby (of course) and it is then removed the rest of the way from the mother.  This is the description of what a partial birth abortion is.  The term partial birth abortion is precisely what it isThe baby is partially birthed and then aborted.   This is a perfect definition.  It troubles me that my friend feels the need to defend the language of the supporters of this act.  Let me address a second point.  My friend also presented what I can only perceive he believes is the reason behind why someone would support partial-birth abortion.  He gives the following quote: The focus isn't on the child, it's on the well-being of the woman.  This, unfortunately is precisely what those who support abortion would have the public believe, but this is simply false.  Now, I will acknowledge that there may be some individuals that would support abortion because they honestly believe that they are furthering the well being of women.  However, these people, while well-intentioned, are simply misguided.  There is overwhelming evidence that never does an abortion (and especially this gruesome variety) further the well-being of women.  The pro-abortion lobby would have you believe that you will be better off after an abortion.  This is not true.  Abortions harm women, not help.  And the pro-abortion crowd knows this. Partial birth abortions are never medically necessary.  I repeat, they are never medically necessary.  Even the doctor credited with creating this technique has been quoted saying this very thing.  They are simply sometimes the easiest and most convenient way to end the life of the child and therefore end an unwanted pregnancy.  I could go on and on regarding the rhetoric that is used to defend this procedure.  However, I will refrain.  I will close in saying that while I dont doubt for a minute my friends sincere disdain for the ending of a human childs life through abortion, (although you cant tell that from his post) I would offer that dissertations such as his, are hindering the ending of such violence on the most innocent members of our society by confusing and diluting the issue. The true travesty in this discussion is that we have lowered the discussion to the level of discussing it as a medical procedure.  We need less of the politically correct and comfortable terms that have crept into this discussion and more terms that describe abortion for what it is.

      In response to your response to me, Jon, she really doesn't need the comma after lovingly.  "Lovingly" can not be describing "way" because "lovingly" is an adverb, which must be describing an adjective.  you can be "lovingly peaceful," but you can not do something in a "lovingly way."  Therefore the comma after "lovingly" would be incorrect, since "lovingly" is describing "peaceful" and not describing "way."  Now if the phrase were, "loving, peaceful way," a comma would be necessary.

      Quoting Jesse:    Quoting Amanda, "(in a lovingly, peaceful way, i mean)"   you don't need a comma after lovingly. "...in a lovingly peaceful way..." is fine :)  Also, for whoever needs to learn this: pluralized words do not have apostrophes. For example, "...after I popped a few Prozacs I'm doing ok now..." should be, "...after I popped a few Prozacs I'm doing ok now..."    You do need a comma after "lovingly." She wasn't using "lovingly" as a term to describe "peaceful," she was using it to describe "way." Therefore a comma is needed. Also, I believe we are both mistaken as to the use of an "s" in Prozac. The term Prozac is itself plural and singular, simultaneously. One wouldn't say "Take two Advils," one would say "Take two Advil." The sentence should read "Anyways, after I popped a few Prozac I'm doing ok now."

      Something extremely funny happened to me today.... (with an opener like that who couldn't continue reading?) I was going on my somewhat daily run this afternoon.  The air was slightly brisk but I soon was warm enough to not mind.  I was at about half-way done when I came around the bend and saw a young boy, about 11, jumping on his giant trampoline.  He was still a bit far off but as I got a little closer, this particular lad determined that it would be a good idea to moon me.  He just pulled down his pants - white, scrawny backside aloft in the wind. This was followed by him flopping backwards on the trampoline.  Finding myself in an unusual situation, I was somewhat at loss as to what to do.  So I did the first thing that came to mind and I whistled at him.  I continued on my way, barely running because I was laughing so hard.  A car passed me and the driver must have thought I was insane - this wacko running down the road laughing her head off.  But it made the last couple of miles go by faster.  But what I still wonder is what possessed the kid to do that?  Having never been a 11-year old boy, I don't know what goes through their heads.  Any ideas?

      Shauna, I know of a beautiful prank, but I don't know if I want to just blare it to the whole world, but here goes, just because I love you.  This is really good if you want to get a whole dorm hallway, which I assume isn't your situation, but it could still work.  1. buy lots of dixie cups  2.  Once whoever you're pranking is in bed, you fill each dixie cup with water (or soup if you want to combine this with Jesse's idea) and cover the whole hallway.  This has hysterical results as you can well imagine.  I've only heard of this actually being done once, and that was to a whole floor of a men's dormitory.  Your prank wouldn't have to be quite as extensive, as there isn't as much floor space, but you might want to enlist the help of some friends anyway.

      Wow...it has been quite a while since I have contributed to this rather intriging experiment in the communication of modern society.  Most of that was due to my knee surgery (which interestingly enough was exactly the event which I thought would have let me contribute more).  However, while I have not been posting lately, I have caught up on all that was written  since I last posted.   Oh so much to respond to...and so little time.  Until after November 4th, life will be very crazy, I will offer no promises on my rate of contribution to this blog until then, but I will do my best.  There are a couple of things which I must respond to when I get the time. One of which (as you expected Jon) is Jon's dissertation on political parties.   I must say, the dialogue on that topic was very interesting to read.  I (again, as expected) have some opinions on the matter, and would love to offer some thoughts on the subject.   On a related note, it has been great to read Bec's contributions to the blog. Finally another voice of political sanity on this wonderful blog.  Bec was mostly right most of the time in what she said.  I am sorry, Bec, that I abandoned you to Jon without any backup.  Jon can be dizzying in his intellect  (as in, I get so dizzy that I can usually only read so much before I have to get off or I'll throw up. ;-)  )     Sorry Jon, I couldn't resist. :)   [chuckle]  So, stick around Bec...it is good to have your thoughts on stuff.   Another thing that was interesting was the decision to play mafia via a blog.  Jon...SIGN ME UP.  I think it sounds cool. The first time may be a little rough, but lets give it a try.  Lastly, I say we crumple up Taco into little pieces and cover him with chili, cheese, and lettuce.

      I'll have you know that college had nothing directly to do w/ my little math problem.  I just got bored in my Soc class, so I picked a random number and by trial and error tried to find it's factors.  It was really quite entertaining.  I tried up to number 19 all w/ just paper and pen.  And the reason using computers is cheating, is because they stifle your mind.  Playing with numbers is good brain exercise.

      79,847 is prime, and of course I used a computer. How is that cheating? It's not cheating. It's being efficient. School's (especially colleges!) shouldn't force people to work at anything less than optimum efficiency. If you want to increase  your  factoring efficiency, go  urlLink here . It's a Java applet that can factor numbers up to 1,000 digits in length.

      Jon - just wanted to re-emphasize my point that I wasn't making a statement about the context of Jesus' words.  My point was simply that Christ used inflammatory language at times.  He thought it was needed and I don't think that it is categorically wrong to use words that cause reactions (not only anger but other emotions, such as guilt).  I do not advocate calling women who have had abortions "baby killers" and the like.  I agree that we should respond to them with compassion. While the act that they permitted to be done to their bodies is wrong, it isn't any different then the sins that I commit daily. However, I also believe in truth.  So the burden on us as Christians is to proclaim truth in a compassionate way, as Christ did.  That is a very tricky thing to do, a thin line to traverse.  But I don't think I have "lofty perch" upon which I am sitting.  My depraved nature is very evident to me.  It is what motivates me to want to speak truth compassionately.

      Wow. I feel like such a minority. Jeff, you brought up some excellent points, showing that abortion is a much more nuanced and complex issue than we've reduced it to.   Bec, Kristen, et. al.... (I'd address each point individually, I think I can lump sum here and still be communicating effectively.) Yes, we need to be willing to call things what they are. And "brood of vipers" wasn't politically correct language by any stretch of the imagination. Its closest modern day equivalent would offend most of the readers of this blog. Anyways... that's how Jesus addressed the  religious  community. That's how He talked to those who should have known better. But can someone give me one example in the Gospels where Jesus used anything less than docile language to speak to those still on the outside? I might have different words about this topic if I were speaking with you in person, but this is a public blog. The last thing I would want to see is some young girl suffering through the trauma of just experiencing an abortion be called a "baby killer." I don't see her as that, and neither does Christ. Christ sees the bigger picture, Christ extends forgiveness, Christ doesn't condemn her. Christ wouldn't cast the stone, either physically or with His words. We sit here in our high, lofty perch, looking down on those still on the outside, hating NOW and NARAL, condemning Planned Parenthood. That's not how Jesus would have acted. Jesus would have presented the path for His disciples to follow, while loving and passionately pursuing those on another path.   I know that was all slightly tangential to the main point - is partial birth abortion a misnomer? I believe so, but I cant find a better word for it. It's too complicated for me to understand. I haven't gone to medical school. You can read more  urlLink here .

      interesting discussion.  Both of you are right.   True words spoken (even if it is my version of truth) often are inflammatory.  Jesus spoke many inflammatory words to the religious community - often so do I.  Jesus also spoke loving words to people - I hope I do that too.  I guess one shouldn't always need to be politically correct.  The NPR lover in me wants to be politically correct, but the righteous anger in me wants to call the abortionists baby killers.   Certainly in a debate situation, it is reasonable to call someone what they wish to be called - this keeps the heated discussion to a reasonable roar rather than making people flip out at each other.  Dialog and discussion can sometime bring clarity to an issue, but its hard to dialog and discuss in a reasonable fashion when everyone is "insulting" each other - intentionally or accidentally.    I believe that our advances in science have muddied up the waters on abortion, I predict that some day soon, late term abortion will be illegal - it just doesnt seem to make sense to kill a viable human just for convenience.  That said, does a 4 cell fertilized egg embreo have a spirit and a soul?  Does a sperm cell or an egg cell carry that spirit (as many catholics believe) or what.  I'm not sure any of that can be proved from scripture.  Some couples that are trying to have a baby could be losing one or more of those a month.  Will that family meet their 35 children when they get to heaven, and what age will they be?  will they still have just 4 cells or will they be fully grown?  I certainly believe that life begins before conception, but what does that mean?

      Again Jon - read a little more in your blog about McLaren's book.  Sounds interesting.  But something I thought of while reading through your blog is the dislike some (perhaps you....)  have of "stark polarizations." I'm not looking to be someone who never sees the other side and I can play the devil's advocate fairly well.  But I think Christians in general are too easy on themselves.  We need to say when things are wrong and draw that "line in the sand."  I do agree with you about John 4 and the true meaning of worship.  I think Christ was emphasizing the importance of the heart in worship - in "spirit and in truth."  But Christ was always looking at the heart, that is where His concern is. Yes, he was in a "realm above their line". But that does not necessarily follow that there was no "line" in Christ's realm.  I think just the opposite - He showed us just where the key is to worship and in so doing showed us what He wants from our worship.  He wants our true worship and so the issue is no longer where your are physically but where your heart is in worshipping God.  That to me is an even bigger distinction (or stark polarization) - where you are on the continuum of true worship and false worship.  To everybody else.... sorry to have gone off on so much.  Hope it wasn't too annoying - but it couldn't be helped.  I had to say something.

      Wow Jon - just read your post (the one about partial birth abortion) and there is so much running through my head that I don't know where to start.... (forgive me, I may leave out words when I feel compelled to write fast - before the ideas leave my head.) First off, the thing I agree with - we need to be careful in the words we use.  A lot of things go wrong when people misinterpret what you mean.  However, that is not the case here.  I want people to focus on the issue at hand which is the taking of innocent human life.  Therefore I am purposefully choosing words that will highlight the distinction.  And for you to make a distinction of when birth occurs is ridiculous.  Ask any woman who is half-way through labor - is she experiencing birth of her child?  "Sorry, ma'am.  Your baby is only halfway out so we won't call this birth."  Or better yet, what if the baby died half-way through the birth canal, has that woman or child experienced birth? Uhhh - yep! I think inflammatory language is needed to polarize the issue.  It doesn't happen enough because people (myself included) are too timid, don't want to offend.  I think that when Jesus referred to the Pharisees in Matthew 12 as "a brood of vipers" that was inflammatory. Was he winning any Pharisees over to his side? Or simply highlighting their hypocrisy? He could have said it more gently or watered-down. But he didn't.   I'm not done yet but I need to get going for now.  Hopefully, I'll finish this up later.

      Jon writes:President Bush has used inaccurate, inflammatory language when referring to this                        procedure. He said, the bill would "protect infants at the very hour of their birth." If                        you paid attention to Senator Santorum's remarks in the debate, though, you would                        have heard him say the procedure was performed "at least 20 weeks, and in many                        cases, 21, 22, 23, 24 weeks [into pregnancy], and in rarer cases, beyond that."                        How long does a pregnancy last? 40 weeks. We're not "at the very hour" of birth.                        We're half way into a pregnancy. The procedure in question is an abortion that sort                        of looks like a birth, not a birth interrupted by an abortion. In defense of Bush, I would like to add my view.  True, PBA may only rarely be preformed after 24 weeks, but the fact is that it still sometimes is, very late in the pregnancy when the baby could survive outside the womb, and even if there was only one case a year the appalling fact is that it is legal - it is legal in our country, that a day before a child's due date (or later) an abortionist may pull the baby partially out of the women and vacuum it's brain out while the child's limbs are flailing.  So yes, this bill does protect babies "at the very hour" of birth, because even at the very hour of birth, it's still legal to kill them as long as the baby is still at least an inch inside the mother.

      An excerpt from my blog about all the fun I had tonight:  Guess what happened tonight?  I went to New Jersey, rather by accident.  Rachel and I went out for Thai, and then we picked up Darcy on South Street, and after visiting a gallary or two, we discussed going to a coffee shop, but instead we headed for home.  Well, uh Rachel took a wrong turn and we were forced to go across a bridge to New Jersey.  At first we were like, oh man, it's gonna cost us three dollars to get back.  But then, Rachel was like, if we're going to spend three dollars anyway, we might as well have some fun in New Jersey.  So, we went to Hess's and Wal-mart (Rachel was obsessed with finding a 24 hour Wal-Mart) and a diner.  Guess what I spontaenously decided to buy?  Fish!  I have two fish now, their names are Darcy and Rachel.  Any bets on who will eat who first?  Anyway, it's rather homey to have some pets.  I had to take my fish into the diner so they wouldn't get too cold in the car.  Right before we left, Darcy and I went to the bathroom, and I left the fish with Rachel.  When I return, she had removed them from the Wal-Mart bag, and was holding them up to visit with the big fish in the diner's aquarium.  My stomach muscles hurt from laughing so much.

      Allow me to join this fair discussion.  I am going to side with Kristen on this one. I too think this is an acceptable, and even desirable, change to our state constitution.   On the contrary Shauna, I think just as much manipulation of children can happen in a court room full of people where the child has to sit face to face with the man or women that has (for example) sexually abused them and told them that if they ever mention what happened, that they would kill them.  One piercing glare from an abuser can carry a tremendous level of communication.  Abuse is an extremely emotional event.  Which would provide better access to the truth.  A child that can explain what happened in an emotionally neutral situation, or a child sitting in front of their abuser (for example) having to look into the eyes that have controlled and manipulated them for (possibly) years.  I don't think those that oppose this amendment to the PA constitution need to get their shorts all knotted up over this.  It is simply changing a few words from (and I think I am close if not exactly accurate) "meet their accuser face to face" to the words "be confronted with their accuser".   It does not require that the medium be video...in fact it doesn't dictate any method in particular.  It simply allows a young child to present their testimony in a emotionally neutral environment.   This amendment simply brings PA's constitutional wording on this issue into line with the US constitution and the vast majority of other states in the Union.  It is not some "drastic change" that is the beginning of a "slippery slope".   The vast majority of states in the country have exactly the same wording as the new proposed wording in this situation.  While, as a conservative that looks cauciously (sp?) on any changes to our constitution, I think this is an acceptable change that provides a small level of decency and protection to some of the youngest in our society.

      Jon writes in his blog, "And the ballot initiative to allow children (and possibly others) to give testimony outside of the courtroom via video passed. This is also a shame."  Why?  Why in the world is this a shame?  I think this is wonderful news.  Why should a six year old rape vicim be forced to recount details of her attack in front of a court room of people?  I think this initiative was long needed.  I'm curious why you don't like it.

      Throwing this into the conversation to see what you all think of it. This is a true story taken from one of my favorite bloggers,  urlLink ianua.org . She's an IT professional working for a Christian company while struggling through her own faith and doubt.   ---------------------------------------------------- My mother left our family when I was very young--3 years old. I shared her name, and for a lot of reasons (including the fact that my father was very perverted), I became my daddy's wife, sexually as well as emotionally.  I was a victim of incest for most of my child and young adulthood ... it went on, even up into my late teens. By my senior year in high school, my father had so convinced me of my disgusting worthlessness, my utter ugliness, and my standing as a total wretch in the eyes of God, I believed that I was lucky to be where I was, to have the "family" that I did, and that I was completely doomed -- I would never ever escape the tyranny of my father.  (there's much more to this, including my father's rabid public conservatism and evangelicalism which radically conflicted with who he was privately, but I won't get into all of that now)  At the age of 17, I became pregnant. At the time, I blamed the guy I was sleeping with, because I didn't understand fully the consequences of all of what the incest meant, (and I didn't dare think of the other alternative). Through time I have come to accept that it was probably my father's child. The timing wasn't right the other way.  At the time I knew enough about my father to know that if he found out about the "problem," he would abort it himself, he was just that way (and he was a frustrated doctor stuck in a lab).   I also knew that I believed in life, that I believed that the child in me was alive and a sacred creation, but I was absolutely terrified. I had no idea what to do or who to go to.  I went to an episcopal priest under the rite of "confession," and he, being a staunch pro-life priest, told me that he didn't care if he got fired -- he believed that life was more important than anything, and he would tell my father if I pursued the abortion.  I was stuck. I felt like the baby would die if I did, die if I didn't.  So I went to the east coast (and met my mother, coincidentally), had the abortion there, then spent the next several years wandering around the country, living with people I met, sleeping in bus stations, trying to find some sort of peace with what I had done and who I was.  There's a lot more to this story, but what I want to tell you is this:  I don't think that -anyone- really wants to abort their child. I don't think that they have this murderous desire in them to take a life. It's not like they wake up one day and decide to get pregnant just to have an abortion.  It's that people don't know any better. It's that the people who can help often stand in judgement of them. It's that sometimes conservatives are so busy trying to save babies, they forget about the women who also (even more desperately) need to be saved. The rallying and the vocalism isn't where the change happens. The change happens in quietness--in love and in friendship and in trying to understand.  It's so easy to be loud and male and defiant. Planned Parenthood and other organizations enforce that by their own loud rhetoric (and sometimes, frankly, they have to scream because the opposition doesn't let them have a voice). But there are more lives involved in this then we often know (or want to accept). There are the lives of the women, the girls -- the people struggling with life and death decisions and feeling isolated and alone at this very important moment in their lives.  And there is so much life -- brilliant, fabulous life -- all around us. there is so much more we can do for all of life...  I do not believe in the death penalty. I do not believe in war. I believe in the sanctity of life on all levelsfrom birth to death. I believe in a form of mercy. I believe in a form of grace ...  ... and I've learned that deadness is more than just what happens to an aborted child. It happens to a woman who feels so wearied from her life that she just doesn't care anymore.  I have been that woman. I have been dead and unable to care. And now -- on the other side of apathy, on the other side of death -- I have learned what it means to be truly alive. ----------------------------------------------------  She writes this in a later post:  ---------------------------------------------------- a choice made, but not my choice.  angry voices amplify the grief, explanations given in powerpoint, in heated rallies, pro-life proclamations in half-lit church basements.   requiescat in pace   pictures of the dead on the side of trucks, on sticks held by angry people standing on the corner, "we will offend you enough to care, shock you out of your complacency."  look at what you do - look at what you have done  i do not look.  the memories still live in technicolour, still live in my dreams, exposed on the table,  false promises,  the choice i couldn't make but had to. ----------------------------------------------------

      I didn't see any excuses here, did you?  He simply said he isn't jumping into it right now.  People like Jon and Jamie have an affliction in which they cannot settle for short posts about any supposedly "debatable" topic.  So they need to set aside about 3 hours to write a post that is long enough to put most normal people to sleep.  Jon should go to college and write discertations or something.

      Michigan trip highlights:  amanda:  i have a booger in my nose tajjy:  better a booger than a chipmunk (the conversation just got sillier from there- in the end i decided that i'd love to have a cute little chipmunk--a mini chipmunk-- up my nose, as long as my screen was functioning properly)  shauna singing "go speed racer go" as I did some intense curves without turning the cruise control off  the adorably hilarious way ruth said in her cute little innocent voice, "good thing you weren't hauling booty."  jello squares becoming a jello patty, later to be poured into a salad bowl from Dairy Queen  the oh so tasty (though it sounds kinda not-so-tasty) pumpkin pie blizzard  making jaron eat vegan food  shauna swearing about trees.  well, actually, she said "blank trees" and meant "bare trees" but it was funny b/c it sounded like she was just blanking out an expletive.  fitting SOOOO many people in my little civic and then pulling ruthy out head first  shooting bunnies and poofing  my sweet brother buying my favorite cereal for breakfast. :)  not being able to play six square because of a "hole" in my stomach, not to mention someone throwing the ball at my face  challenging boys at steak and shake to six square (Shauna said "bring it."  It was great!)  free krispy kreme donuts, right off of the conveyor belt!  mmmm  driving down the wrong side of the road  the air mattress issues  Two of my favorite things at the same time:  Alias and bunnies!  Remy calling me "Mananda"  Shauna calling me "Amander"  i know there's tons more....but i need to actually get some work done (or maybe just nap on my desk...I'M SO TIRED!).  Thanks for a great trip Shaunster, Tajjy, Ruth, and Jaronius.  Thanks so much to Laura and Helen and Remy for places to stay and lots of fun.  You guys rock!

      Just a few thoughts on the ballot question discussion... I think that while the intention is excellent - to protect children from the various "negatives" (for lack of a better term) that arise from needing to meet your accuser face to face in a trial - there is much danger in the the amdendment.  My biggest concern lies in the possible coercion of the child's testimony.  So while a Constitutional change may be what was needed, I am wary of how it will be implemented, utilized and/or abused.  I guess this is ultimately up to the Legislature to decide and for the court to determine if the legislation is then constitutional.  But I haven't heard of any talk to act on that which is curious to me.  It seems like obvious legislation, but maybe I am wrong/missing something. Or maybe the gambling issue has so gridlocked the legislature that they won't truly focus on genuine issues....

      Well, ladies and gentlemen, thanks for your patience. It's time.   What the freakin' heck were the citizens of this state thinking when they approved a constitutional amendment so that criminal defendants no longer have the right to confront their accuser(s) face to face? The amendment changed Section 9 of Article I, the Declaration of Rights of the constitution by eliminating the language that assures that those accused of a crime have the right to meet their accuser face to face. I believe that the voters of this Commonwealth were mislead into thinking this would only apply in cases where children are involved, but that will not be case. Perhaps that was the intent, but it won't happen that way. Even if it did happen that way, it would still be a bad idea. Here's why:  Personal confrontation is powerful. Jesus taught us this in Matthew 18. "If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'" Jesus taught that those being accused (even the guilty ones!) have the right to be confronted by their accuser. Why should we change that?  There is also the issue of prosecutorial misconduct in the criminal justice system. We have stacked the deck with prosecutors that are only interested in conviction rates, not the truth. That's because we live in a "Get Tough on Crime" society that rewards politicians and prosecutors who are brutal to people, even innocent people. Putting these men and women in front of real people, real juries, real defense attorneys, live and in person, brings a pressure and intensity that would be greatly diminished when hiding behind a television screen. I work in television, and so I understand how difficult it is for people to "be real" when dealing with any type of media. A person in front of a camera is going to be a different person than one in front of 12 living, breathing, watching human beings.   We go on and on all we want about "protecting the children," but truth is what were after with the justice system. Truth should not be sacrificed on the altar of our version of "compassion."

      Taj,  I would not call it an affliction to realize that most topics are not adequatly discuessd in 3 sentences.  Perhaps discussions on bunnies, trips to Michigan, and inhaling chipmunks can be adequetly addressed in your proverbial "short post".  However, there are some discussions that require a bit more thought and time to adequetly provide ones opinion.   I would rather wait for a long time for a post from John which, although very probably incorrect, will be thoughtful, articulate, intelligent and witty.

       Kristen -   Yes, I am fed up with the materialistic nature of the American Christmas season. I find myself participating without a thought until I wake up to the reality of selfish desires which underly the whole thing. If there's one thing we must do this Christmas, it's wake up and hear our selfish voices crying out, and then to refuse to feed the hunger of self. Let us instead look to the Lord our Creator, the Owner and Planner of the Great Story which engulfs us, and let us do all for His benefit and glory, for the greatness of His Kingdom, and for an offering of thanks to Him.  About the fishbowl, you should follow the example of the Cat in the Hat: buy some red and white paint, decorate your fishbowl with broad stripes of said colors, and wear it on your head. For added effect, hire some friends to be Thing 1 and Thing 2.

      Here's another one: Men who are angry every day or who are social hermits have a much higher risk of developing gum disease. That's the word from a Harvard University study that found men who are angry on a daily basis have a 43 percent higher risk of developing periodontitis compared with men who keep their cool, reports United Press International. The 10-year study included 42,523 male health professionals who ranged in age from 40 to 75 years.  Weirdly, friendship seems to protect against gum disease. Men who reported having at least one close friend had a 30 percent lower risk of developing periodontitis than those who don't have a buddy, and men who attended religious services had a 27 percent lower risk of gum disease. Divorced, widowed, and never-married men were at a slightly higher risk of developing periodontitis compared with married men. Why? The Harvard researchers think stress is associated with poor oral hygiene and increased glucocorticoid secretion. That can lower the immune function and increase insulin resistance--factors that can lead to gum disease.   Okay...you're probably tired of my blurbs by now.  :)

      Haha...this is interesting, too: The early stages of a romantic relationship are a lot like eating chocolate--at least as far as our brains are concerned. The dopamine-drenched brain is very focused on planning and the pursuit of a pleasurable reward. The same regions become active when we fall in love as when we enjoy the pleasure of eating chocolate, says lead researcher Helen Fisher. More ominously, the brain in love also shows patterns that resemble aspects of obsessive compulsive disorder.    obsessive compulsive disorder...that's great!

      I'm glad the ruckus was brought here, because I don't feel like taking up my own server space and chasing the fallacy of thinking around several different blogs. Here's a statement from Human Rights Watch:  --------------------------------------------------------- One can only rejoice at the capture of Saddam Hussein. Few people are more deserving of trial and punishment. U.S. forces deserve credit for arresting the deposed dictator so that his crimes can be presented and condemned in a court of law, rather than arranging to kill him in combat.  But the stakes now are enormous. The fairness of the tribunal he is brought before will determine whether his prosecution advances the rule of law in Iraq or perpetuates a system of arbitrary revenge. Washington says it has not yet decided what to do with him, but the first moves of the U.S.-dominated Iraqi Governing Council are not auspicious.  Saddam Hussein's government was responsible for the murder of a quarter of a million Iraqis. Among the occupants of the mass graves being unearthed in Iraq today are 100,000 Kurdish men and boys machine-gunned to death during the 1988 Anfal genocide, many after having been chased from their homes with chemical weapons; the 30,000 Shiites and Kurds slaughtered after the 1991 uprising; other Shiites killed during the 1980's because of their perceived sympathy for Iran; so-called Marsh Arabs killed as the Iraqi government drained the marshes and destroyed a culture that had thrived for centuries; and many individual Iraqis of all faiths and ethnicities who were singled out, their lives ended, for real or perceived opposition to the regime.  To do these victims justice, their plight should be recorded in a court of law and their perpetrators properly judged and punished. But the Iraqi Governing Council, taking its lead from Washington, last week established a tribunal that is to be dominated by Iraqi jurists. Despite the superficial appeal of allowing Iraqis to try their own persecutors, this approach is unlikely to produce sound prosecutions or fair trials. It reflects less a determination to see justice done than a fear of bucking Washington's ideological jihad against any further enhancement of the international system of justice.  As we know from Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, prosecutions of genocide or crimes against humanity can be enormously complex, demanding jurists of exceptional skill and sophistication. They require amassing volumes of official documents, collecting sensitive forensic evidence from mass graves, presenting hundreds of witnesses from among victims and accomplices, and paying scrupulous attention to the requirements of due process. To avoid being perceived as show trials or "victor's justice," they call for highly experienced jurists of unquestioned integrity.  Saddam's brutal and arbitrary justice system can hardly be expected to have produced such jurists. Prosecutions were typically based on confessions, often induced by torture. Serious criminal investigations, let alone complex trials, were virtually unheard of. The Iraqi Governing Council hopes to solve this problem by looking to Iraqi exiles as well as Iraqis from communities historically repressed by the Baath Party who remained in the country. But even among these it will be difficult to find jurists with the right combination of skills and emotional distance from the former dictatorship to produce trials that are fair - and seen as fair.  An internationally led tribunal would be a far better option, whether a fully international tribunalor, more likely, an internationally run tribunal with significant domestic participation, such as the special court set up for Sierra Leone. Because its personnel would be selected by the United Nations rather than by Washington's surrogates, an internationally led tribunal is more likely to be seen as legitimate. And because it can draw from a global pool of talent, it would be better able to secure the experienced and fair-minded jurists than a court that must look only to Iraqis. An internationally led tribunal could still conduct trials in Baghdad and involve Iraqis as much as possible, but it would be run by international jurists with proven records of overseeing complex prosecutions and scrupulously respecting international fair-trial standards.  Despite the obvious merits of an internationally led tribunal, Washington is adamantly opposed, which largely explains the path chosen by the Iraqi Governing Council. But Washington's opposition reflects its ideology, not concern for the Iraqi people. The Bush administration calculates that a tribunal of Iraqis selected by its hand-picked Governing Council will be less likely to reveal embarrassing aspects of Washington's past support for Saddam Hussein, more likely to impose the death penalty despite broad international condemnation, and, most important, less likely to enhance even indirectly the legitimacy of the detested International Criminal Court.  No one should endorse these self-serving reasons. Governments should encourage Washington to allow an internationally led tribunal to try Saddam Hussein and his henchmen. The people of Iraq deserve no less. ---------------------------------------------------------  I'm opposed to the death penalty on religious and ideological grounds, but I'm going to take a purely pragmatic stand here. Executing Saddam after a trial from the  US backed  (and installed) "Iraqi Government" would not lend any legitimacy to anything, at all. America would be happy, because the Witch Is Dead. We don't need a dead witch, though. We need to win the hearts and minds of the Arab world, who, although most hated Saddam, they hate America more. An internationally led court, with full disclosure and full UN, EU, US, and Arab backing will provide the justice that we need, but will do so without alienating the Arab world. Right? This shouldn't be an "Iraqi"trial, because Iraq is still too fragmented to run a trial of this magnitude. Who would lead it? A Shiite cleric? His people were wounded the most by Hussein. Or maybe Kurdish? Would they just be out for vengeance? Ahmad Chalabi? He would be terrible. This needs to be a internationally setup and internationally run court, based in Iraq.

      Jesse...I mean...Tajjy: I remember you saying a while ago that you like almonds.  Well, I just found this little blurb and thought you might find it interesting:  Eat almonds and lose weight A study published in the International Journal of Obesity compared two groups of people who were placed on a 1,000-calorie-a-day liquid diet. One group also ate three ounces of almonds every day. The other group was allowed to eat a mix of complex carbohydrates that included wheat crackers, baked potatoes, and air-popped popcorn. The group that ate the almonds lost more weight--even though the calorie counts for the two groups were identical. In addition, their systolic blood pressure dropped 11 percent, compared to no change in the other group. Why is this significant? It's long been assumed that a calorie is the same no matter where it comes from. Even though the group eating the almonds consumed more fat, they lost more weight. Their Body Mass Index readings dropped 18 percent, compared with the other group's 11 percent.

      Quite the point, Jeff.  Yes, the increase of pornographic abundance is definitely due to the fallenness of our flesh.  But then you could blame the fallenness on Adam and Eve for having partook (?) of the fruit they were told not to eat.  But then, of course, Eve coerced Adam to eat of the fruit, so it's more her fault than his.  Oh, but hey, it was the serpent (Satan) who influenced Eve to do it in the first place, so yeah, it's his fault.  Oh, but the fruit was there to be eaten, so I guess it's really the fruits fault for existing, except that God created that fruit and put it there in the garden, so it's God's fault.  In case you haven't noticed, the blame game gets pretty messy.  Yeah, it's our fallen flesh that makes us desire the 10 minute excitement of masturbation with the aid of pornography, but it's our own responsibility to not give in to it.  And it's quite possible that the government is doing (much) less than it should to prevent pornography from becoming so overwhelming, but when's the last time you let the government know how much of a problem you had with it?  It all comes back to you, the citizen.  After all, the people are given the power by the constitution, are we not?    So I don't think it's right that you blame the secret desire, the devil, or the porn stars, Jeff, but it's also not appropriate that Jon blames the whole problem on male Christians.

      who screwed up this blog... it looks so ghetto on my computer.    i know... nice way to start a conversation jeff...   ive been MIA... from this site for a very long time...   hmmmm  the only blog that had anything really recent and really interesting was Jonsblog.... and Kairsies...     I was amazed how thought provoking some of the stuff was  jon writes  "Our country was founded by actions that run in diametric opposition to the Biblical view of government laid out in Romans 13. "Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves." The Declaration of Independence was an act of pure rebellion, which, as fundamentalist parents love to tell their children, is as the sin of witchcraft. We seem to think that because we won we were justified. Nowhere in scripture is victor's justice provided for."   I found it interesting to think about... and I believe to ONLY use Rom 13 to define your worldview is a dangerous way to live.  You really need to take the whole of scripture to find out how to live.  I had to disagree though with this statement...   " The United States Supreme Court is not responsible for the overabundance of pornography in our culture. Lazy, selfish, sinful Christians (male Christians) are. "    uuuhhhhh   no... I don't think so...   how can you blame that on male christians?  Call me simpleminded, but arent the pornographers responsible for creating pornography?   And the consumers who pay for it are feeding the beast.  I don't like being blamed for it.  I believe most of the blame needs to go to our inner flesh - who desires a quick fix to a emotional need... oh, and a physical need in some cases.  And some of the blame needs to go to the enemy the devil, who roams around the earth seeking whom he might devour...  And some of the blame needs to go to the females, who prostitute themselves and their pictures for CASH.

Cover your advance using smoke when crossing an obstacle. (Task 071-325-4407, Employ Hand Grenades.)   2.   Ensure your buddy is covering you since obstacles are normally covered by either fire or observation.   3.   Cross barbed wire obstacles.   Warning: It is threat doctrine to attach tripwire-activated mines to barbed wire    a. Check barbed wire for booby traps or early warning devices.   (1)  Look for booby traps or early warning devices attached to the barbed wire.   (2)  Throw a grappling hook with a length of rope attached over the barbed wire.   (3)  Pull the rope to set off any booby traps or early warning devices.   b. Cross over barbed wire using wood, grass mats, or some chicken wire to protect you from the barbs.   (1)  Throw the wood, mat, or chicken wire over the barbed wire.   (2)  Cross carefully because such a mat or net forms an unstable path.   c. Cross under barbed wire.   (1)  Slide headfirst on your back under the bottom strands.   (2)  Push yourself forward with your shoulders and heels, carrying your weapon lengthwise on your body, and holding the barbed wire with one hand while moving.   (3)  Let the barbed wire slide on the weapon to keep wire from catching on clothing and equipment.   d. Cut your way through barbed wire.   (1)  Leave the top wire in place to make it less likely that the enemy will discover the gap.   (2)  Wrap cloth around the barbed wire between your hands.   (3)  Cut partly through the barbed wire.   (4)  Bend the barbed wire back and forth quietly until it separates.   (5)  Cut only the lower strands.   4.   Cross exposed danger areas such as roads, trails, or small streams.   a. Select a point at or near a bend in the road or stream. If possible, select a bend that has cover and concealment on both sides.   b. Crawl up to the edge of the open area.   c. Observe the other side carefully before crossing.   d. Move rapidly but quietly across the exposed area.   e. Take cover on the other side.   f.  Check the area around you.   5.   Cross over a wall.   a. Roll quickly over the top.   b. Do not go over standing upright.   6.   Cover your buddy as he crosses the obstacle.    Evaluation Preparation:  Setup: Select a field location that has crossings, walls, and barbed wire entanglements. Designate a suspected opposing forces position and point it out to the soldiers. Establish a standard by timing yourself and an assistant as you run the course twice. Average times and add 10 percent as maximum time for soldiers.  Brief Soldier: Tell soldiers they are going to be evaluated on how they move over, through, and around the obstacles while attempting to get within 100 meters of an enemy position. Tell them they must negotiate at least one of each type obstacle: exposed danger areas, barbed wire, and a wall. Tell them they must run the course within the standard.

      Whoa... Bess? I had that thing in high school and it sucked so much. I couldn't do freaking anything. I couldn't check my freaking Hotmail. Bess sucks. I managed to get around her at the end of 8th grade, for about two weeks. But then our system administrator fixed that hole. Stupid SysAdmin.

      The other one you got wrong was about my favorite room in the house.  Everyone seems to be getting that one wrong.  Oh, and very few people know my middle name, but the choice they make is much better than my actual middle name, so I'll just pretend that's it.  Everyone else should take the quiz too!  Do you know the  urlLink  Taj?    This blog is so boring... but my sister and I cannot be blamed for the lack of activity or faithfulness from everyone else :)

      How sad.  I'm a failure as a sister.  I got an 80 on my brother's quiz.  I definitely should have had at least a 90, though.  I totally second-guessed myself and it cost me a whopping 10 points.  It was the one about where he wants to live.  Hm...what was the other one I got wrong?   I forget.  Oh well.

      If I have to take an "Oath of Office" I'm not sure I can continue in this newly given role... Jesus said "Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one."  I'll try to refrain from adding an applet that counts dead bodies, but it certainly would help if we had a President that made such applets unnecessarily.    Banning Jamie hmm that would be unjust, so I wont.

      Do we need to conduct a special inauguration service for the new administrator? Is their a special oath of office to administer to someone in this role...Hmmm...maybe something like, "I will pledge to do everything in my power to make this blog not suck", ....or maybe, "I solemnly swear to never use this blog for personal gain".   Feel free to contribute any suggestions you all might have and we can administer the oath of office to Jon to officially transfer the power of 'administrator' to him. :)  2 initial suggestions for the new admin  1) Fix the layout....this blog is kinda ugly  2) Resist the urge to add another applet that counts up dead bodies....

      I learned a great use for lemons this past summer!  After getting all sticky, say from eating lobster or crab, you can use the juice from the lemon to clean your hands, and it sanitizes, too!  Germs can't handle the lemon-y freshness of lemon juice!  So in that respect, germs=your eye.

      I am an aunt!  :) Evan Rhys (pronounced "Reese"...it's Welsh) Walls was born this morning to James & Chrissie!  Very exciting, my friends, very exciting!  In other news...yours truly will not be moving to California.  While most of me is somewhat relieved, I have to admit I'm a little disappointed.  I'm all about getting out of Berks county, but the idea of being THAT far was a little overwhelming for a while there.  I was just starting to get used to the idea...oh well.  So it's looking like we'll be moving to Philadelphia at the end of the school year, afterall.  That could change, though.  Who knows.  We're learning to live one day at a time and leave our plans in His hands.  It's a wild ride. :)

      I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.
