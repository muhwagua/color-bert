      Last night I seriously over booked myself.  I really need to pay more attention to what I agree to.  Work from 8 - 5, which ran an hour late.  Rush home and change.  I was invited to go to Kayla's new schools Fall Fling carnival.  Kayla is my 6 year old neighbor and she is just one of the cutest kids. Her brother, John, will be 2 in January. I am lucky enough that their parents, Tina and Pete, let me play with them.  We moved here when he was only a couple of weeks old and it has been a blast watching them both grow and change.  Mark and I both totally adore them.  I view it as my duty to make sure that little boys know it is bad to make her cry  :o).  I had a GREAT time with Kayla and John and the carnival.  She was running around telling kids and their parents that I was her friend and I had a real motorcycle.  She always makes me feel like a hero.    I didn't get home from there until 9:00 so I came home, changed jackets, and was off to my kickboxing school's Halloween party.  Another great group of people.  everyone is treated like family.  Standard greeting is a hug and kiss on the cheek.  Can't help but feeling at home with this group.  I started kickboxing about 3 weeks ago now.  It is great!  Good exercise, good fun, and I get to beat people up twice a week.  You can't beat that!  I didn't get back to the house again until 11:00 so I decided to stay home.  I felt kind of bad.  I had wanted to go to my friend Creech's birthday/Halloween party.  His parties are always great with a biarre mix of people.  Just going to people watch is a blast.  I just wasn't in the mood to haul my cookies up to Redwood City for it.  This afternoon I helped Tina get party favors and such made up for Kayla's Hallowen party tomorrow afternoon.  I had blown two hours before I knew it.  It is nice having another chick around to gab with.  Everyone I know are guys.  Never really got along with chicks much.  I always tell her it's great she had kids.  I can play with hers, have all the fun, and no need to be having my own yet :o).  Tomorrow I will probably go over and help finish the decorations and help with the party.  Looks like she will have around 40 kids!  She throws the coolest kid parties.  I am jealous.  Never had stuff that cool when I was a kid.  Then again, everything kids have now is a lot cooler than what I remember there being.  Watch this spot for updates.  I will try to get better at writing and keep pretty regular updates.  Julz

      A few months ago I crashed at Thunderhill.  At the time it appeared all I had done was get a small concussion and bruis my left arm a bit.  Well, the shoulder never stopped bugging me and all the Aleve and Advil in the world wasn't helping.  When I started kickboxing a few weeks ago it really started bugging me.  I finally broke down and saw an Orthopedic doctor.  Her diagnosis, a strained rotator cuff.  Her solution, six weeks of physical therapy twice a week and some heavy duty anti-inflamatory drugs.  My thoughts on the whole thing, YUCK.  I went to my first PT appointment yesterday having no idea what to expect.  The doc there is pretty cool and I like him.  He did some tests to isolate exactly where the injury was and decide what to do about it.  Then he came back with a big book full of excellent illustratioins of everything under your skin.  Turns out I have damaged a tendon that is part of a cluster of muscles and tendons that make up the rotator cuff around your shoulder.  Don't ask me the name, I can't remember.  It goes inbetween bones and isusually an exact fit.  If it swells up due to injury then whammo!  You have what I got, pain. Constant, annoying, degrees of pain.  I am thinking I am going to have to do a mess of boring exercises and all.  Nope!  I get to sit there.  Now this is physical therapy!  They put two types of warm goop all over my shoulder and then do this heated ultra sound thing.  Mmmmmm, very nice.  Then they top it off with a few minutes of the worlds largest, coldest ice pack.  Totally ruins the whole relaxing ultrasound thing.  Going by the restrictions they gave me I may as well just tie the arm off.  No lifting anything over a pound or two with my left arm.  No moving my arm over shoulder level.  This is going to make sleeping hard.  My arms are always over my head.  No carrying things with my left arm.  He started to say something about not riding so much but then he just smiled and said to stay light on the bars and lean on my tank bag :o).  At least he understands.  He also didn't say I had to stop kickboxing.  Of course, I didn't exactly ask either.  Classic case of "don't ask, don't tell".  Mark has managed to come down with a wicked little cold.  I think the sudden weather change caught him.  Poor guy is quite miserable.  His band, Moxie Rox, (http://www.moxierox.com) will be playing their first public show November 2.  I am really proud of him.  He plays so well and he has so much fun.  The whole band is pretty cool.    More later!

      Halloween was a blast!  Mark and I had both forgotten to get candy all week and so we both ran in a grabbed a bunch on the way home form work.  We ended up with some 10 or 12 bags of candy.    Mark was looking around at the neighbors and decided we had to do something or we would be lame.  We grabbed one of the FZR400's that was in a state of disassembly and laid it down on the lawn.  Then we stuck a light under it to give it that spooky bike wreck look.  The  we tossed the plastics from the bike around the lawn.  The candy was put in this huge bucket we use to put kegs on ice in and we had so much it was filled half way up.  I put a big sign on the bucket that said "CANDY" and put the bucket towards the top of the bike wreck.   Mark dug out his messed up leathers and his messed up helmet from his big crash at Buttonwillow and put it all on.  I took some red food dye and we smeared it on his leathers like blood so he looked pretty gross.  Then he went and laid on the lawn with his head near the bucket.  Even the adults weren't sure or were positive it was a stuffed dummy!  Mark spent the evening laying on the lawn and making boys and girls, young and old scream.  We managed to give away almost all of that candy and he had a blast.  Pictures will be posted soon.  Watch this space for a link.  Tomorrow night is the big night for Moxie Rox.  I am looking forward to it.  I am getting kind of old now so I am gonna have to take a nap Saturday afternoon or I will end up falling asleep during the show.  We will be out well past my bed time.  Plus I am pretty sore from kickboxing class.  I got to graple for the first time  Wednesday night.  It is a Jujitsu thing and a lot of fun.  It is kinda like wrestling.  I started laughing after class.  We graple pretty rough.  You could tell by all the hair on the mat from everyone in the class.

      I have two words... FLU SUCKS! I feel like a giant snot factory with no temperature control on the thermostat.  Just what is up with the cough that accompanies this years flavor of flu?  Non-friggin stop!

      Random things to catch everyone up.  Mark is in another band!  They've been together less than a year, but more than six months.  Check out their website at http://www.moxierox.com .  Since getting together with Moxie Rox Mark has aquired a great deal more instruments and built a very cool digital studio in one of the rooms of the house.  He went from having two electric guitars and one acoustic to three electric guitars, one bass guitar, one acoustic, a home built electronic drum kit, and keyboard.  He's even been making some original tunes that sound really good!  If you are in the San Jose area mark Saturday, November 2nd, on your calendars.  Moxie Rox will be performing live and in public at The Fifth Quarter, 1373 Kooser, San Jose, at 9:30pm.  This will be their first public performance.  Up until now they have only been doing private parties.  Hope to see everyone there!  Isn't funny how you can fly from India to San Jose in one day but a postcard you sent from India won't arrive in San Jose until 12 days after you do?  Thanks for the postcard Charles!  Whenever someone I know travels oversea's I always ask them to steal me something.  The rules are that it cannot be purchased and must have country or city name on it.  I have gotten some fascinating things this way.  I have a whole collection of ill gotten booty from around the world.  My most recent was a really neat bottle opener from the Taj hotel in India.  The thief broke the must not purchase rule and also brought me home some beautiful silver jewelery from the market in Chennai, India.  I couldn't be mad though.  It is beautiful and it feels good to know I am thought of.  They moved the entire IT group, (all 6 of us), into another area this week.  It bites.  Instead of having a real cube with real walls I am now stuck in a bullpen.  Oops, I am sorry.  It is a "think tank" configuration.  You know, te configuration that makes sure everybody is in your business.  I spend my whole day with my phone headset over one ear and my finger in the other.  No walls, means everybody gets to hear everyone else's conversations.  Whether we want to or not. I am not happy. I have always hated bullpens.  They make people act weird.  Like your desk is a common area.  Something a couple of little walls prevent.  Oh well, more later.    Julz

      Today was a great day.  Woke up late, laid around, showered, and then went across the street to help decorate for Kayla's Halloween party.  Came home for a bit and made some grub for Mark and I was back to the neighbors to help out with the party.  Wow!  A lot of kids.  I lost track of how many.  I know that a great deal of food was eaten, drinks were drank, and fun was had by all.  We put tons of tose temporary stick on tattoo's on loads of kids.  We got soaked bobbing for apples. A Spiderman pinata was broken and children dove for candy and prizes. There were so many great costumes.  The kids were just adorable. I put blue and red stripes in Kayla's hair and she looked great!  I am home now, with a load of junk food, and very tired.  They can really wear you out.  Mark's day wasn't as good.  He has a horrible cough that is keeping both of us up at night, a miserable headache, and is producing enough snot to fill a bathtub.  He was supposed to go to rehearsal today but couldn't make it.  Poor guy.  I really hate it when he's sick.  I always feel so inadequate because there is so little I can do about it.  The good news is that I haven't got whatever he has yet.  Usually I manage to come down with everything he gets in no time flat.  I may actually beat it this time though.  I am getting tired of sharing diseases with him.  Julz

      So, due to families deciding to get married and travel great distances and such Mark and I will be staying home for Thanksgiving.  Since we decided to stay home but still wanted a huge turkey dinner we are having one  :o).  This year we have invited a few friends over and I am gonna cook a huge amount of food.  Then we are going to live on left overs for the next week or two.  Margaritas and turkey will be the key words for the day!  There was just no way I was going to Mom's for Thanksgiving then driving home, then 4 days later going back to Mom's for my cousins wedding.  Speaking of cousins weddings I am just about to be the last hold out among us.  Eight cousins and by the end of this year it looks like out of us there will be only 2 left by the end of the year who have chosen to remain unmarried.  Gads it makes me feel old.  I remember when I thought my oldest cousins were gods and then when I thought they were just dinosaurs.  They are so much older than me they've always been the big kids.  Of course, that made me the bratty tag along cousin.  Playing with me wa s a chore you had to do at holiday gatherings.  They must have done ok.  I can't remember them ever being mean to me.  Except for that whole glow in the dark scorpion under the bed thing.  To this day I get the creeps walking in a dark room with a bed in it.

      Today sux.  The more I do my job, the more I hate it.  I am truly sick of people who lack the common sense nature gave a jellyfish and insist that you know nothing.  Well if you know so stinkin' much why are you calling me to fix your friggin' problem?!?  Oh, and why is English so friggin' hard to speak?!?  Gads, I spend half my day trying not to make a cultural faux paux with some of the end users.  It's stupid.  You're in the USA!  Get used to OUR ways.  We behave according to your ways in your country.  What's so damn hard about dealing with our ways in our country?    The bullpen is hell.  I spend my whole day whispering and trying to look busy when I have nothing to do.  I have cleaned and reorganized my space more times than I can count.  You hear EVERYthing in here and everyone else hears EVERYthing you are up to.  If a fly farts we all hear it.  I am at a point where I will cry tears of joy when I lose this job.  Make no mistake, I will lose this job.  It's only a matter of time before they have more lay off's and I am only one of three people left from the contract company they use.  They have decided to no longer supply cell phones to end users which eliminates one more thing I was in charge of.  We don't order any parts or PC's anymore so I have nothing to do there.  Soon they will eliminate pagers as well.  I am also in direct line of sight of the Director of I.T. so I am forced to look terribly busy even when it is painfully slow.  I knew my days here were numbered as soon as they moved our butts into this friggin' bullpen.  It's one thing to know people are keeping an eye on you.  That's normal business. This really stinks though.  To feel the hot breath of the "your position is being eliminated" dragon every day, every hour, is just wrong. Having a crappy job I can deal with.  Not having a job at all I can deal with.  Waiting to not have a job is just too much.  ARRRGGGHH!!!!  Julz

      Marks show went great last night!  Many of our friends showed up and we packed the bar.  The bar owner was very pleased and everyone thought the band was great.  Thanks to everyone who came.  It was great to see so many of our friends and to know we are thought well enough of to have their support. I will get Mark to write up a little report and post it here.  I am still exhausted.  We didn't get to bed until 3:30am. Good night.  Julz

      Woohoo!  Change of plans.  Did a little checking and I can get both classes I need online for my two associates degree's. Registration was sent this week for Economics at Hancock College and Business Communications at DeAnza College. So by summer I will be a college graduate.  Then I can complete my computer science associates and transfer to a university for a bachelors degree in that.  Let's just hope it doesn't take as long as my associates.    I try to do all my classes online now thru the distance learning offered.  I get much better grades when attendance isn't required and I can do things my way, on my time, and my learning style.  I never have done well with the standard way of education.  Can't sit still for it and all that damn group interaction crap annoys me.  Most people seem to run at a slower speed and less organized fashion than I do.  Group activites annoy me.  Forced group activites piss me off and I tend to fight them to my disadvantage.  If I want to interact, I will.  If I don't want to and you make me, everyone around me pays.  I tend to make everyone around me as miserable as I am.  Not a good idea but I can't seem to stop myself.  I expect one day I will outgrow this but at almost 32 years old I doubt it.

      Last night I did a practice test for my kickboxing.  Sifu says I should pass no problem.  I am still kind of nervous.  I am not real comfortable being watched yet when I kickbox. I got brave and asked Mark to come to my test anyway.  There will be quite a few people there and while you test they are all staring at you. So by Saturday afternoon I should be a yellow belt kickboxer.  One more day and I get a whole week off of work!  I will be pretty busy though.  My house is a mess.  I have some serious house cleaning to do.  I would be so embarrassed if my house was not pristine for all my guests.  Gotta do a bunch of child proofing to.  I would hate for the kids to get into something they shouldn't.  More later...  Julz

      Not much to say.  I have been working a lot of over time trying to pad my paycheck.  I am going to get laid off the week before Christmas.  I am not supposed to know that.  Mark and I updated my resume last night and I started circulating it.  If I am lucky I will land something.  If I am just another casulty of the Silicon Valley then I may take more then one class in the Spring.  I am now two classes away from two Associates degree's.  I mailed in my registration for one class this week.  It is gonna be hard.  Economics has never been my strong suit.  After that I will register for Business Communications and I will be an official college grad!  It only took 12 years!  Oy.  Kickboxing is going great! I have lost 10 pounds and I test for my yellow belt this Saturday.  I am very excited about it.    The Thanksgiving plans are coming together nicely.  I am pretty nervous about cooking a meal for 13 people, including my Mom.  The good news is that she will be here to help so I won't screw anything up.  Mom makes the worlds best turkey gravy.  I drool just thinking about it.  Mark is still wishing he had any job but the one he has.  The new Controller is just a dork who apparently does little to nothing.  The band has a booking agent now. She was VERY impressed with their CD.  Looks like I may become a bar fly soon supporting Mark at shows.  They are very good and I am very proud of him. He is a lot of fun to watch play and if you get the chance you should come see them when they perform.  That's about it for now.  I will try to write something more comprehensive this weekend.

      So after Mark's visit to the Emergency Room and lots of rest and drugs he was getting better.  Then this morning WHAMMY!  He is back to where he started and back to the doc he goes.  This time to a specialist.  Looks like I am off to my cousins wedding alone this weekend.  No way he can ride and sitting up that long in the truck is just asking for misery.  Should be a good weekend though.  Saturday morning before the wedding I am going to take an easy ride with a friend back home.  She just got her first bike recently and is loving it.  Oh well, more later.

      So I thought having the week off would be great.  Boy was I wrong.  I get more rest at the office.  At least here there were no people to bug me with questions that simple common sense could have answered.  I have learned that common sense is a rare commodity in the human race.    Saturday I got my yellow belt.  Mark went to watch me test.  Spending 3 hours of boredom only to see my 5 minutes of fame sure made me feel good.  Spent the rest of the day doing a bit of cleaning and preparing the shopping list for Thanksgiving.  Sunday I did a minor bit of cleaning and a major bit of sleeping.  One day I will have to expound on the wonder of sleeping for hours and hours.  Sometimes I wish I could go back to my teen years and the days of sleeping so much I would miss and entire 24 hours of the world around me.  It was wonderful.  The older I get, the more I love sleeping, the less I seem to be able to get. Baically I woke up long enough to put the groceries away and make a list of the things I needed to actually go to the store for.  Should be fun.  I haven't seen the inside of a grocery store in months.  I despise shopping of any sort.  The internet is the best place to shop.  I can do it in my underwear and not even brush my hair.  No traffic, no "special" people, no annoying clerks with their movement gears set at slow and slower, and no old ladies blocking aisles while they summon the ability to make a friggin decision.  Monday I slept in, cleaned some more, did the final shopping, ran off to physical therapy and my first class as a yellow belt. Physical therapy went well as usual.  Kickboxing had a problem.  One of the first things I get to learn is falling.  Essentially you hurl your body at the ground in one of four prescribed methods. The idea is to do it properly so it does not hurt.  Umm, well, this takes practice. First thing I learned is that my shoulder is not ready to be hurled at the ground in two of the methods.  How did I learn such a thing so quickly you ask?  Simple, I hurled my body to the ground and an intense pain went through my shoulder, arm, and neck. I figure this is a one time thing.  Being the brilliant person I am I decide to give it a couple or three more tries.  So, as my Mom says. "She has to learn things the hard way".  I spent the next 45 minutes working on the two falls I could do and feelling the growing, pulsating pain in my shoulder telling me the swelling will be impressive by the time I get home.  Most of the time I say pain is just weakness leaving the body.  I think I need a secondary saying.  Something like pain is your bodies way of informing you that you are stupid and it will make you pay.  Tuesday I slept in.  Starting to see a pattern here?  Shoulder was not happy, which was making me unhappy and of course I had to spread the joy :o).  It was also pie day number one.  My first unsupervised adventure into making pies useing Mom's recipe's.  If they don't taste good I will die.  Made two apple pies.  Dang near stopped after peeling a few apples and headed out to Bed, Bath, & Beyond to buy and apple corer/peeler.  It took me forever just to get the apples peeled, cut, and flavored.  I can see why people prefer to buy pies rather than make them from scratch.  Scratch may taste better but who on earth would do this all the time?!?  Mark came home, told me that days act of idiocy by the morons at his office and ran off to rehearsal.  Moxie Rox has added something like 26 new songs to their list and are trying to get them all down before the show at Fibber McGee's, December 27.  Wednesday I freaked out.  I had a ton of cleaning to do, two more pies to make, a run to Hickory Farms, an appointment with the orthopod, physical therapy and my Mom would be arriving around dinner time.  So the first thing I did was nothing.  Then I took apple pie number two to the office for the guys who were stuck there during the shut down.  What they didn't know is they were my testers.  I didn't want to go feeding people at my house an unknown so who better to use for a food poisoning check then co-workers :o).  All was well, smiles all around, and nobody puked.  Life is good, pies are a go.  Ran home and began the pies, ran off mid-pie to the orthopods, back to pies, stuff in oven, run to Hickory Farms, cancel physical therapy appointment, finish pies, inform Mark I have earned sushi for dinner and he is the one to buy it.  Orthopod is happy with my progress.  She says I will probably take two or three more months to heal though.  She is under the silly idea I am active, hard to tie down, and use my arms a lot.  Ok, so she's right.  All pies came out well but one.  The one that didn't come out well still tasted damn good though.  It just didn't set up right so it was more like lemon soup than pie.  So, I used a spoon instead of a fork to eat it.   I decided Hickory Farms needed a whole paragraph of its own.  Where I grew up Hickory Farms was a treat.  A VERY tasty treat.  I could live on the beef stick and cheesballs alone for months. You waited all year for Hickory Farms.  The store would show up in the mall a week or two before Thanksgiving and be gone by New Years Day.  You had to get all you could while it was available.  When I moved up to the Bay Area and discovered they have stores in malls here all year long I was in heaven!  Woohoo!  Hickory Farms whenever I wanted it.  Man, this city livin' might be ok after all.  Any place that has Hickory Farms all year can't be all bad ya'know. It only took me a few months to get to a point of ot even wanting to look at the stuff.  Now I am back to waiting faithfully all year for my Hickory Farms.  This year I splurged.  I bought the large beef stick and three different cheeses.  Now all I have to do is wait for my Christmas See's Candy box of nuts n' chews and my year will be complete.  On to Thursday and the adventures of Thanksgiving.  I wake up to the sounds of some serious pain and it isn't me.  Fifteen minutes later I am in the truck driving Mark to the Good Samaritan emergency room where he is given two shots, and perscribed three bottles of pills.  I am freaking out.  I got a bird that needs to be stuffed and put in the oven.  Call Mom, who accuses Mark of faking and says she is sure we are at Denny's having breakfast so I can get out of getting the bird in the oven. Thank goodness for Moms.  She got the bird all stuffed and in the oven for me.  Now I am all off schedule though and it is gonna get worse.  I am freaked enough about cooking my first Thanksgiving meal for 12 to 15 people and now my perfectly planned schedule is out the window.  Turns out Mark is having some kind of serious muscle spasm thing that hurts like hell.  I remember when he had to take me to the ER for the same thing and hurts like hell is quite an understatment.  Problem is they sent him home with a perscription for three bottles of pills, it is Thanksgiving Day, and I need to find an open pharmacy before the shots wear off. I also still have several side dishes and appetizers to prepare.  I call around and the nearest open pharmacy is a Walgreens 15 miles away.  I jump on the bike and break land speed records getting there.  The only open pharmacy for 15 miles, I should have known would be packed and badly under staffed.  I spent more time in line then I did getting there and back.  I figure give them the perscriptions, wander around store for 20 minutes trying not to do any impulse buying, pick up drugs, go home. BZZZZT! Wrong!  They tell me it is gonna be one and a half to two hours.  Did I mention I am in a really crappy part of San Jose where being a white girl on an expensive, pretty, motorcycle is not exactly ideal?  Home I go to get the side dishes prepared. Side dishes mostly ready and back to the pharmacy in Timbuktu for more fun with the mentally challenged.  You ever get the impression some people are exactly in their place in life?  Finally everything is going well, on schedule, Mark is drugged and I am feeding him alcohol to give it an extra kick.  I am thinking I might even get a shower.  Well, it was a thought.  Guests started arriving and now I am stuck with my unshowered look.  The good news is it went great.  The food was just like I remembered it when I was a kid. Everyone seemed to like it and all had a good time.  I also now know the limit on dinner parties.  I almost ran out of plates and serving dishes!  It was great having my Mom and all of our friends.  Friday Mom went with Tina, our neighbor from across the street, to the Harvest Festival craft show at the convention center and I cleaned up after Thanksgiving.  It only took four loads in the dishwasher and all was done.  Mark was still quite uncomfortable and could only sit up for a few minutes at a time before it hurt too much.  I finally got my shower much to everyone's pleasure.  Saturday we all laid around all day.  Mom and I went to the craft store on Union for a bit but didn't see much.  Sunday I slept in, woke up to see Mom off, and have spent this day dreading going to work tomorrow.   REMINDER:  Moxie Rox will be playing at Fibber McGee's in Sunnyvale, Friday, December 27.

      News on Mark.  Doc says he has a couple of compressed discs.  Now he gets to take prednizone  .  I am a little nervous about him taking that medication.  My Mom had to take it when I was a kid and the side affects were severe psychosis and depression.  Essentially I spent all my time trying to be the little mommy and cook dinners for us and dad and keep my little brother out of firing range.  She went nuts, literally.  It had to be awful for her. Being a kid that was not what I was thinking about at the time though.  I was learning how to cook... FAST.  Good thing it was during the summer or I would have never been able to get my brother and I off to school and fed and everything else.  Anyway, looks like Mark will slowly get better and I will be watching closely for psychosis.

      Went to my cousins wedding over the weekend.  It was very nice and Trish, his new wife, was just beautiful.  Now matter how nice a service it is weddings always bore me to tears.  I simply do no have the attention span for it.  It didn't help being there alone in the sea of coupledom.  I had to fend off all the "when are you getting married", "is he your finance yet", "I was sure you were engaged" crap on my own.  I started getting a bit sarcastic and almost crude with my replies.  They kept me entertained though.  I bolted for the door as soon as etiquette allowed.  Not much fun hanging out, alone, realizing you are a middle generation cousin, with nobody to hang out with.  Everyone was either 15 years older or 15 years younger than me. At 31 I am just to big for the kids table and to young to sit with the adults.  I still wouldn't have missed it though.   I got to see people I haven't seen in years and it was fun to show them me, all grown up, and not knocked up in prison.  I have been to a lot of weddings, added up a rough estimate of the bill in head, and made a decision.  I am not going to bore anyone with all that nor will I start my life out with someone in debt over a ceremony.  It seems so stupid to me.  One of two things will happen if I ever get married.  My Mom will get a phone call and be told to either get on a plane to Vegas or get in the truck and get to San Jose.  I will put on my clean jeans and a nice shirt and we will do what needs to be done in the shortest ceremony known to mankind. A short time later I will throw a pot luck BBQ where we can all get drunk and eat cake.  No debt, no ceremony to sit through for the beer and cake reward. I can't sit still through a five minute cartoon and have been known to wear a walkman at funerals just so I don't fidget so I don't expect anyone else to try and sit still thorugh mine.  Heck, I don't expect I could sit still through mine.  Yawning while the judge is yakking on and on at your own wedding would not look good and I haven't figured a way to hide a walkman :o).  So, Mom and I bolted from the wedding and then headed off to a little shin dig that a co-worker was throwing. Once again I get to amaze people with the all grown up version of Julz.  I must have been hella wild when I was a teen.  A lot of the people my Mom works with are teachers that have known me since jr.high.  The cool thing is it is all the teachers I remember liking and I always love to see them.  I figure a student as an adult, or as adul as I get, is the product that a teacher strives for and really never gets to see the end result of.  So I get to see them, and they get to see that they made a difference. It works for me anyway.  We hung out there for about 30 or 45 minutes and then headed home.  I sat around the house foir a bit and decided to call Nici and see how she was doing.  Might as well try to see some friends before I haul my cookies another 260 miles back to San Jose.  Nothing like cramming 500 miles, a wedding, a party, and visit with friends all into 24 hours.  Ended up hanging at Nici's until midnight and then back to Mom's for some sleep.  Sunday I woke up, went by grams house, and headed for home.  It is a long boring superslab ride.  So I try to make a time trial out of it.  Best time is two hours and thirty minutes and that included a fuel stop!  One of these days I am going to get so arrested.  Monday Mark went in for his MRI.  He will have the results Wednesday when he see's his doc.  Watch this spot for an update.

      So Mark is doing much better now.  He is feelling good enough to over do it a bit though and is making himself sore.  I am sure in another week or so he will be starting physical therapy.  He still can't ride and it's going to be a while before he can.  I don't think the truck has ever been driven so much.  He is able to play his guitar more now and that is making him happy.  He spends hours in the digital studio he built playing and recording.  It is all very cool and I am quite proud of him.  The rain doesn't seem to end.  Just when it starts to dry out it starts coming down again.  I like rain when I have the day off to watch it through the window or play in it as I please.  I hate it when I have to work though.  Sit in a big building all day and have no knowledge of the outside world.  I am much more of the forest ranger type than the office type.  I still don't know how I ended up in an office.  Growing up all I wanted to do was work with horses and tigers or be a forest ranger.  Some how I ended up behind a computer working with people.  I hate people. There is no logic to them and you simply cannot make sense of them.  With animals you can follow the logic.  There is always an explanation.  I still wish I was working with horses and large cats.  Oceanography and marine mammals were always fascinating too.  Nope, no outdoors for me.  Desk duty.  Gads just shoot me now.  Mark and I being the not-quite-grown-up-adults we are once again could not wait until Christmas to give each other gifts.  It's funny now though.  When I was a kid it was all about the getting.  Now I will get something so cool for him that I just can't wait until Christmas to give it to him.  This has resulted in us having one or two mini-Christmas's before Christmas where we just give each other one gift.  Kind of to tide us over.  This Saturday I got Mark a beautiful new Stratocaster Deluxe guitar.  He just loves it.  It is a gorgeous candy apple red and the wood is beautiful.  He gave me a digital camera.  A really nice one to.  It is a Sony Cyber Shot DSC-P7.  I am learning how to use it and having a lot of fun.  It is just the right size for my tank bag and he got me a nice case to keep it safe for traveling.  If anyone wants to spend around 50 to 100 bucks on me I sure would like the 128 MB memory stick for it but I wouldn't complain about a 64 MB one ;op.  On the "gee I love my home appliances" front, my washing machine decided to just keep filling up on Saturday.  Nothing I did would stop the water.  I couldn't even turn the machine off.  Pretty soon my feet were soaked and I am turning knobs, pressing buttons, and shutting the water valves off like crazy.  I am sure it would have been funny to someone watching.  I totally paniced in a Lucy Ricardo way.  I managed to get it shut off before the whole garage was flooded.  Nothing important got soaked.  Only about half the garage was covered in sudsy water.  That's it for now.  Don't forget. Mark's band, Moxie Rox, will be playing at Fibbar Magee's in Sunnyvale Friday night December 27th.

      Gads I am tired.  I went to work this morning.  Mark slept in... brat.  Pretty much today ws a day of waiting for tonight.  I didn't stay for the whole show.  Rain had started and I was tired.  A good number of our friends showed up.  It always feels good to have your friends support.  The show went well, the bar was packed, and people danced.  I liked the place.  If I ahd been able to take a nap before going I would have liked it better.  Our friends being the great group they are immediately pointed out the lead singers very pronouced camel toe insisting on pictures. So of course I obliged.  A good time was had by all.  Tomorrow, oops it is almost 3am, today I will be roasting a 11 pound prime rib.  We are having Mark's Dad and hos wife over for dinner. As well as a friend of mine from Santa Maria, Raul.  So I am off to bed now before I pass out at the keyboard.  G'Night!

      The Christmas week day by day...  12-23-02:  Basically woke up, packed, and rode 260 miles of painfully boring super slab to Mom's.  It sucked going alone. Weather didn't feel to bad when I left so I thought I could get by without my electric vest.  BIG mistake.  Froze my butt off.  Had to go alone because Mark is still unable to ride or handle long trips in the truck.    By the time I arrived at Mom's Mark was just getting home from his latest doc appointment.  The good news is that he has no nerve damage from the compressed discs in his back.  The bad news is that he has carpal tunnel in both wrists. Not good for a guy who rides a motorcycle almost exclusively and whose favorite past time is playing guitar.  The braces have really helped reduce the amount of pain he is in though.  The medication they gave him has helped some but not enough and is taking too long.  It's not a lack of patience it is the constant aching.  He is grown very tired of being in pain all the time.  I can see that it is exhausting him.  The poor guy looks like he needs a nap all the time now.  To take care of this they are now going for the more invasive option number two.  On January 9th he will go in and have an epidural where they shoot the meds right to the spot that needs it. I think it is cortisone or something like that.  He is not to thrilled about it and I can see he is a bit nervous.  He less thrilled about aching all the time.  Once at Mom's I sat around for a bit and then we went and grabbed some dinner.  Some of the worlds best hot pastrami sandwiches.  After dinner I went to a friends house and visited.  I am always trying to cram to much into these short visits. After I left there I ran into another friend and spent another hour visiting with him.  I always stay out later than I should but there is no real point to going back to Mom's early if Mark isn't with me.  All I do is crawl into bed and watch TV until I am too exhausted to stay awake.  I really hate travelling without him.  I don't get any sleep.  12-24-02:  Christmas Eve. This is when my family comes together to watch the sisters pretend nothing is wrong.  It seems that somebody is always ticked off at someone else.  Instead of yelling at each other or expressing that they are pissed they stew in it.  It is the cattiest bunch of women I know.  They are happy to tell anyone that will listen that they are unhappy with one of the others except the person they are pissed at.  They certainly aren't going to tell the person why they are upset. They run around holding grudges, wagging their tongues, and passing judgement.  It is sad really.  My brother and I may not have gotten along very well growing up but at least we knew where we stood with each other.  Don't get me wrong, I love each and every one of them.  They are my family and they care about me just as I care about them.  They just have odd logic.  I guess it is this way with most families though and I can't complain. Sometimes it is even fun to watch. The older I get the less entertaining it all is though. I do not like that family gatherings feel more like a chore now and have become less enjoyable. I miss being young and oblivious to it all.    We did have a nice dinner and I just love my cousin David's kids.  He really had great kids. He scored in the wife department too.  If I had a bigger paycheck those kids would be spoiled at Christmas.  Amanda is just a doll and is always ready with hugs and a smile.  Clayton looks just like his Dad and only recently warmed up to me.   My Grandmother gave all the cousins $1000 for Christmas this year.  She appeared to really enjoy being able to do it too.  It was great to see Grandma so happy. I told her she shouldn't have and she told me better to have it now then after she is dead.  What do you say to that?  I have only recently realized that she is getting old and it scares me.  For as long as I can remember Grandma has been there with hugs, cookies, and all kinds of stuff.  Her house was a great place to be.  It was creepy the first time I looked at her and saw her as she is.  For some reason she always looked exactly the same to me now as she did when I was a child.  It just never occurred to me that my Grandma would ever die.  I have wonderful memories of Grandma's house from when I was growing up and I am very grateful to her for that.  My childhood had some serious lumps in it but I can't remember a single bad thing about Grandma's house. Unless you count tripping over my own two feet and having to go get stitches. Can't count that though.  When I remember it, it is funny.  Mark got me a wonderful digital camera for Christmas. Which I now carry with me everywhere and am chronicalling everything. Mom had an awesome, custom built, deep pit, oak wood BBQ made for me.  I can't wait to get it up here and start burning some meat.  After the family gathering I went to Arroyo grande to see Mark and Marci.  I had hoped I would be able to see Annette as well but ran out of time and energy. Their new house is beautiful and I am going to try and duplicate the set up they have for their bed.  There is something about it that just says "relax, you are in a safe, warm, sanctuary".  12-25-02  Christmas Day:  I woke up, bundled up, went by Grandma's to say bye to her and my Aunt's, and hit the road.  I really hated being away from Mark for Christmas and have decided that it will not happen again.  It really did suck.  My sole desire was to go home and be with Mark.  I did the ride in record time.  Not because I was in a hurry, but because I dang near froze to death.  My bikes normal running temp is 184.  For over 50 miles it wouldn't go over 162 it was so cold out.  A good portion of the ride was in the low 30's.  By the time I got home I had to actually warm up before I tried to take a shower or bath.  Even cold water stung and burned my skin.  A note on home and where it is.  I think I can say I have finally flown the nest.  It was strange to drive all over Santa Maria, looking around, and feel like I don't belong anymore. My whole life it has been my home.  When I first moved to the Bay Area all I ever thought about were my visits home.  I have spent most of my time here in the Bay Area feelling homeless. For the first time I was in Santa Maria, and all I wanted was to be home.  Home was not where I thought it was anymore.  Santa Maria is no longer my home.  I do not belong there anymore.  It's all weird, kinda philsophical, and hard to explain.  It's just a feelling.  My home is in San Jose now.  Mark is my family.  I am where I belong.  I honestly believe if I had not met Mark I would still feel homeless living here.  But now I am in San Jose, with him, and I am home.  It's pretty cool.  12-26-02:  I went to work.  Mark got to sleep in.    12-27-02 and the Moxie Rox show report to be continued next post.  Julz

      Rain finally stopped yesterday.  Looks like it won't be raining again until after Christmas.  I will be riding down to Mom's Monday to spend Christmas Eve with my side of the family and riding back Christmas Day because I have to work Thursday.  I was thinkig about doing another 24 hour deal but that always beats the hell out of me.  I am very tired.  Mark bought me the latest Anne Rice book and I can't put it down.  I started reading it yesterday and I feel asleep with my face in the book twice before I finally gave in an went to bed at 3:00am.  I highly recommend Blackwood Farm, the latest installment of the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.

      Some things you just have to share.  One beautiful December evening Huan Cho and his girlfriend Jung Lee were sitting by the side of the ocean. It was a romantic full moon, when Huan Cho said "Hey baby, let's play Weeweechu."   "Oh no, not now, lets look at the moon" said Jung Lee. "Oh, c'mon baby, let's you and I play Weeweechu. I love you and its the perfect time," Huan Cho Begged.   "But I rather just hold your hand and watch the moon." "Please Jung Lee, just once play Weeweechu with me." Jung Lee looked at Huan Chi and said, "OK, we'll play Weeweechu." Huan Cho grabbed his guitar and they both sang..... . . . . . . . "Weeweechu a Merry Christmas, Weeweechu a Merry Christmas, Weeweechu a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!"

      HAPPY NEW YEAR!!  Mark and I didn't do anything last night.  He went out and got mexican take out for dinner and we curled up on the bed and watched TV. At midnight the neighborhood sounded like a war zone but the aerial fireworks were great! So we went outside and watched for a few minutes at midnight, came in, and went to bed.  They say life gets more exciting as you age.  I would love to know who "they" are and just what their idea of exciting is.

      Ugh!  I hate having to work during shutdowns.  I shouldn't be complaining though.  I still have a job that it didn't look like I was gonna have.  It also looks like I will have it for a little while longer. At least 3 or 4 weeks.  There is still something awful about working when the rest of the company is having a two week holiday.  It is better than 2 weeks of not getting paid but it still blows.  The dinner Saturday night went great.  I cooked the prime rib a little more than I like.  Everything else came out great and we we had a great visit with Mark's family.

      Current Birthday Talley: - 2 bouquets of flowers - 1 very cool Plantronics CT-10 wireless headset phone - 1 Happy Birthday call from my Dojo - 1 free breakfast from the cafeteria guy at work - 1 yahoo greeting from a cow-worker  All in all, not a bad day as birthdays go.  Now if the damn clock would move a little faster.  One more hour and I can go home, put on my jammies, and stay in them until Monday morning.

      I love TiVo!  I will never be able to watch regular TV again.    On the embarrassing news front.  I got punched in the nose Monday, Jan 6.  Here's the Readers Digest Abriged version.  I was in kickboxing class.  The girl I was teamed up with is a very powerful kicker.  It was my turn to hold the bag.  Basically, it s big pad with handles on the back.  The way I was holding it faced my knuckles at my face.  I wasn't ready, girl let go with a huge high kick, slamming my knuckles into the bridge of my nose.  I now know a new definition of pain.  My nose swelled up, the part of my nose near my eyes turned purple, and it hurt like hell for two days solid.  Today, if you touch my face anywhere, my nose hurts.  It is totally weird.  Last week on went on this totally 80's, things I wanted when I was a kid but my Mom couldn't afford to buy me, find it on eBay kick. I have now recieved Simon, Super Simon, Star Wars Simon, and keychain Simon.  I have also gotten a rellay cool mini-Space Invaders.  Mark got the old Mattel football game that was just the blips on a screen and the baseball as well.  I am really tempted to buy more of the games I wish I had but am holding back.  I could go nuts buying all that stuff and there is no need to.  I am sure I went a little crazy with the Simon game.  I paid so little for them though that I couldn't help myself.  I did stop myslef from bidding on the Pocket Simon at least.  I scored with the Simon game though.  Only paid 5 bucks for it and it is one of the original ones with the clear case instead of the black plastic one.  The little guy across the street, John, turned two last Friday.  it's been fun watching him grow.  Mark and I bought him the totally cool Tonka Mighty Mighty Dump Truck with a little hard had and some little tool toy.  We had gotten another Tonka toy for Christmas and his Mom says he is just loving playing with it.  I have been going nuts trying to find a new chain for my bike.  The stock chain is a D.I.D. 532, 116 link o-ring chain.  I can't even get one from the damn dealer!  So says I, how about converting to a 530 chain.  I want steel sprockets.  Aluminum wears out to fast on a commuter bike.  Guess what?  The morons can get me a steel sprocket for the front but only aluminum for the rear!!  I have called everybody and then some.  This is ridiculous.  The bike COMES from the DEALER, from YAMAHA, with a friggin'  532, D.I.D., 116 link, o-ring chain.  Even the shop manual specifies this!  Why is it so damn hard to get a friggin' chain?  I may have to convert my bike to a 520 chain just so I can get steel sprockets and a freaking chain for it.  It is just plain stupid.  School has been delayed.  I was totally pissed off.  I showed up Monday for my Distance Learning, (keyword - distance), Business Communications class only to find out that the instructor requires us to show up once a week.  Huh?  I signed up for a DISTANCE learning course to be taught over the internet?  What's the deal with that?  Apparently it is also OK to arbitrarily change the time of the class.  Instead of 6pm - 6:50pm he says it will now be 7:30pm - 8:30pm. What a load of shit!  I have another class Monday nights at 7:30pm.  I ask him, "Is this set in stone?".  He says, "Afraid so".  That is just plain bullshit.  I registered early and carefull planned my life around all this.  How is it that the instructor can just decide to change the class time.  And just what is the deal with making people show up every week for a distance learning course?  Did it occur to this fucking genius that maybe people sign up for internet courses for a reason?  Like maybe getting to school si a little difficult?!?  Like maybe we have REAL jobs, and REAL lives, and REAL bills to pay.  That maybe school is a damn luxury we have to save up for and squeeze into our lives while we try and pay the bills and keep our jobs in the messed up economy?  Hell no.  They think all we do is go to school.  We are independantly wealthy people who can change our schedules at the drop of a hat.  I fully intend to write a nasty note to DeAnza about this.  It is total bullshit.  Now I will not have my degree until at least September.  That is assuming I still ahve a job and can afford to pay for the damn class.  Dorks!  I have posted some new pictures of Mark on the pics site, http://photos.yahoo.com/redgsxr750 .  He is awfully cute in them.  I have been bored lately while at work.  If you got some time, message me for a chat!   Yahoo Messenger    RedGSXR750 AOL Instant Messenger    FstGSXR750 MSN Messenger    R6Chick@hotmail.com ICQ Number   8191523  Julz

      Short note.  Mark rode the Triumph to work today!  I will know when I get home if it hurt a lot or if he will be back riding again.  Good thing too.  He was getting VERY tired of driving the truck to work in the traffic around here.

      Birthday went well. Enjoyed a nice quiet weekend at home in my jammies.  I am thinking I must have done something to piss off the Aunt's though.  I usually get cards from them.  This year, nothing.  I am the only cousin to remember all of their birthdays.  And with delivered flowers no less!  I am not one to keep score though and this will have no effect on their future bithdays. They are score keepers.  They give with the expectation to recieve.  It is stupid and just wrong.  I will continue to send flowers if I can afford it and cards if I cannot.  But I will also point out to them when they complain about how they did whatever for so and so and then so and so transgressed by not doing for them.  Not that they will see the light of day.  They will continue to talk nasty about each other behind each others backs and think only of themselves.  All this while complaining that everyone else is self centered.  I am glad I only have my brother.  I don't know if family size is what causes this ridiculous dynamic or what.  With just me and Mike, we know the deal.  We may still fight like pit bulls but nobody else will be allowed to join.  :o)

      When I got home Friday Mark gave me another gift.  I got a 128mb memory stick for my digital camera and a USB memory stick reader so now I don't have to plug the camera in every time.  Very cool!  Last night we had a few friends over for a small birthday get together.  Brad brought me a cookies n cream ice cream cake with Happy Birthday and my name on it and everything.  George brought his new girlfriend, Risa.  I have been wanting to meet her.  George has been a lot more content lately and I wanted to meet the reason why.  I like her.  She is very nice and Geo looks so stinkin' happy these days you can't help but like her.  I did have to change out of my jammies since we were having company.  I compromised. I out on some lounge around the house sweat pants and a big t-shirt.  Next weekend will be mroe interesting.  Mom is coming up, brining my new BBQ pit, and we are going to Cirque Du Soleil.

      Mom is visiting this weekend. A couple of months ago Mark bought tickets for all of us to go see Cirque Du Soleil, Varekai.  We went last night and it was GREAT!  I recommend everyone see Cirque at least once http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/default.htm .  It is one of the most wonderful and mesmerizing shows on the planet.  I have now seen two shows live a couple of others on tv.  My favorite so far is Drallion.  One day I hope to go to Las Vegas and see O! and Mystere at the Bellagio.

      So last night just sucked!  My Mom bought Mark fifth row seats to the Sharks and Ducks game at the Shark tank last night for Christmas.  I had been looking forward to it for over a month! Game started at 7:30.  I have been sick as a dog all week.  Monday they sent me home from the office I was so bad.  Tuesday I couldn't get out of bed if I had wanted to.  You could have set the bed on fire and I wouldn't have moved.  Wednesday and Thursday I went to work only because I can't afford a short paycheck right now but I was miserable and mostly useless.  I tried like heck to go.  Wasn't happening.  I was miserable by the time I got home from work and there was no way I was gonna be able to go and enjoy myself.  So Mark went with our friend Eric and I was out cold by 8:30.  Today I am totally depressed about missing the game.  I sent Mark with my digital camera though and he took loads of pictures for me. Blah.  He said he is gonna by tickets for us to go to a future game and buy me a Sharks jersey to make it up to me.  Dang I got me a great man!  Mark has been doing well enough to ride his bike to work this week.  He is really enjoying it.  No more traffic woes for him.

      So I think I may have not been as clear as I could with one of my previous posts.  My family, ALL of my family, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.  I wouldn't trade them and their bickering for the world.  I love them, warts and all.  They are my family for pete's sake!  I have never known a single one of them to do anything to hurt another on purpose.  What they do, they do because that's the way family's are.  The bigger the family, the bigger the bicker.  I never even realized I had a large family until I met Mark.  My Christmas list covers two pages.  His fills up a post it note.  I never really started to appreciate my family until a couple of years ago.  Amazing how you have to practically turn 30 to be able to appreciate your family.  Some of my family is older than I and still don't appreciate what they have.  They can't see past the negative.  I am not even sure they can even remember the positive.   I have one cousin I hope someday can.  I can remember playing with this cousin when I was little.  I worshipped this cousin.  I wanted to be just like this cousin.  I miss having this cousin to look up to.  There is a great deal of negative now but for the most part, I remember the fun.  I remember all the time I spent pretending to ride horses, running around Grandma's house, and playing with this cousin.  This cousin was the most fun and the one who gave me the most attention.  My other cousins were teens when I was born and didn't seem to want much to do with me being a little kid and all.  I kinda laugh when I look back on how they just couldn't see me as an adult once I had grown up.  They never realized it I am sure and it doesn't bother me.  It's the way life goes.  To them I was their "baby" cousin.  Even in my early 20's.  Not anymore though.  It helps that my cousins were kind enough to have children.  Younger ones around always help the youngest of the pack grow up in the eyes of family.    This weekend I got to use my new BBQ pit for the first time.  It is totally perfect!  Thanks to my Aunt and Uncle Bell I have loads of good oak wood for it. This weekend we did tri-tip and linguicia.  Next weekend we are doing chicken and maybe some baby back ribs.

      Well kids, it's happened.  Friday, February 14, my Valentines Day gift from work is no work!  I am laid off again.  This sucks.  I am not happy.  Ia m going to apply at Costco.  It is a 75% cut in pay but at least its stable and doesn't require any thought.

      This weekend was the cleaning weekend.  Our garage has become overwhelmed with stuff.  Loads and loads of stuff.  I couldn't even see my race bike anymore.  So Mark built a shed that we bought a year ago and then we filled it.  Soon eBay will be our friend.  Bunches of stuff will be auctioned off.  Now I can see the garage floor, we found my race bike, and you can move around without bumping into anything.  Woohoo!

      Wanna talk fun?  How about more emergency room fun.  I moved one to many monitors at work.  Friday night felt a little crappy, Saturday afternoon I was sitting in the emergency room crying and begging for pain killers.  I was seriously considering banging my head into a wall until I passed out.  My back is all kinds of sore still.  I spent the whole weekend heavily drugged and asleep. Today I am just sitting at work waiting for the day to end so I can go home and take drugs and not hurt.  If this isn't done hurting by Friday I am gonna go see a doc.  It definitely sucks.

      So today was my first real day of being unemployed.  I was bored out of my skull.  My living room was vaccumed three times.  I broke out the dirt devil spot scrubber and now there isn't a spot left.  Figured I should pace myself.  So I started the kitchen.  Tomorrow I will mop and such.  Probably super clean the bedroom and master bathroom as well.  http://www.oddtodd.com

      Good News!  My back is much, much better. Still a tad stiff and a bit sore but I am not in constant pain and the major spasm's have stopped.  Marks back is also doing a lot better.  He has been riding to work again for two weeks.  This weekend was nice.  Mark gave me half of my Valentines Day presents early.  I real live (very expensive) Mighty Ducks jersey!  It is very cool.  I look forward to wearing it to the next Sharks, Ducks game at the Shark tank.  Hopefully I won't get to much grief from the die hard Shark fans.  Valentines Day I pretty much went to work to turn in my timecard, pack the last of my cube toys, and say goodbye.  It really sucked.  I wanted to cry.  As much as I hate my job I love it much more.  I am going to miss the people I worked with.  They were one helluva a great group.  Mark was great when I got home.  He had the day off. While I was ay work saying goodbye he went out and bought me beautiful flowers.  Which for Mark is a pretty huge thing.  The guy doesn't do flowers... ever.  For him to go to a real florist shop and pick a bouquet is damn special.  I would have loved the flowers even if they were ugly.  Since I didn't really know what to do with myself I plopped on the couch, turned on the tube, and took a two hour nap.  Turned out I was gonna need it.  I had offered to babysit Valentines night for the neighbors so they could go out and be adults for a night.  So for an evening Mark and I had our hands really full.  Kayla is 6, Grant is 4, and John is 2.  Lucky for me John worships Mark so he was Marks handful.  The two older ones were a lot easier.  John has definitely hit the terrible two's.  He is not bad at all.  He is just, well, 2.   Mobile, into everything, active as heck, and cute the whole time.  He kept Mark moving all night.  By the time we got to go to bed we were beat and slept very well.  Saturday I don't believe we did anything.  A whole lot of laying around.  Sunday Mark decided to rearrange the studio and trade desks with me.  So now the office is much cleaner and the studio looks different and also cleaner.  We also started what has turned into a multi-day house cleaning and organizing.  Got out the spot scrubber and cleaned up all the cat yak spots and a few mystery spots.  Then took a break and went to the neighbors for a nice dinner.  Tomorrow begins the first day of my unemployed life.  I figure my first goal is to wake up before noon.  Then I am going to clean, clean, clean.  I might even go to the grocery store.  I haven't been inside one for months so it should be fun.  That's about all.  Basically a very boring domestic weekend.

      Last Sunday Mark and I decided to quit smoking.  The good news is we haven't killed anyone yet or decided to kill each other.  The bad news is we have replaced it with another habit.  We eat anything.  We eat constantly.  Lots and lots of sunflower seeds.  My tongue is in total pain from all the salt.  Switched to carrots.  I feel like a friggin' rabbit.  Neither one of us is getting much sleep which is maiing us even grumpier.  We have also started the process of hacking up all the lung cheese.  You would think that would make us not feel like eating so damn much.

      This was sent to me by a friend.  I think its a good idea. My Mom would have them behaving like alter boys in no time flat!  Subject: Calling all Mothers Inspection Teams....   Have you noticed anything fishy about the inspection teams who have  arrived in Iraq? They're all men!  How in the name of the United Nations does anyone expect men to find Saddam's stash? We all know that men have a blind spot when it comes  to finding things. For crying' out loud! Men can't find the dirty  clothes hamper. Men can't find the jar of jelly until it falls out of  the  cupboard and splatters on the floor.... and these are the people  we have sent  into Iraq to search for hidden weapons of mass  destruction?   I keep wondering why groups of mothers weren't sent in.   Mothers can sniff out secrets quicker than a drug dog can find a gram  of dope. Mothers can find gin bottles that dads have stashed in the  attic beneath the rafters. They can sniff out a diary two rooms and  one floor away. They can tell when the lid of a cookie jar has been  disturbed and notice when a quarter inch slice has been shaved off a  chocolate cake.   A mother can smell alcohol on your breath before you get your key in  the front door and can smell cigarette smoke from a block away. By  examining laundry, a mother knows more about their kids than Sherlock  Holmes. And if a mother wants an answer to question, she can read an  offender's eyes quicker than a homicide detective.   So... considering the value a mother could bring to an inspection  team, why are we sending a bunch of old men who will rely on  electronic equipment to scout out hidden threats?   My mother would walk in with a wooden soup spoon in one hand, grab  Saddam by the ear, give it a good twist and snap, "Young man, do you  have any weapons of mass destruction?" And God help him if he tried  to lie to her. She'd march him down the street to some secret bunker  and shove his nose into a nuclear bomb and say, "Uh, huh, and what do  you call this, mister?"  Whap! Thump! Whap! Whap! Whap! And she'd lay some stripes across his  bare bottom with that soup spoon, then march him home in front of the  whole of Baghdad.   He'd not only come clean and apologize for lying about it, he'd cut  every lawn in Baghdad for free for the whole damn summer.  Inspectors my ass... You want the job done? Call my mother.

      You would think with all the spare time I have now I would post more.  Not much to say.  Mark and I are still doing well not smoking. At least we can say we haven't bought any.  We have been cheating a bit but not much.  The band is doing well. Almost booked every weekend in May and they will be playing at The 5th Quarter April 5th.  They also have someone who wants to hire them to play their wedding!  Even better, one of the bar's they play are willing to pay them extra not to play at any other bars near it and are putting them on their "A" list of bands.    I started my economics class last week.  I asked them if I could substitute my life for the units instead.  I figure I know all I need to know about economics getting laid off twice in 14 months.  Still no job.  The war gives me something to do.  I have a couple of friends in Iraq.  One is on the Constellation and the other just parachuted in to Northern Iraq with the 173rd Airborne Brigade.  So I make care packages and send them off.  People have donated $205 so far to help me pay for it. Several have asked me to let them know when the funds get low and they will keep donating as needed to help.  I really do associate with the best people.  Yesterday I tested for my orange belt and passed!  Now when I kick your ass it is felony assault with a deadly weapon instead of the standard fist fight charges hahaha :o).    I have been selling some bits and pieces of my extra spares from my race bike for some extra cash. So far we are doing ok.  I am also looking at other career fields.  There is no future in what I do and I am tired of worrying about losing every job I get.  Maybe x-ray technician or phlebotomy (blood sucker). People will always need x-rays and bleeding.  Racing season has started.  I don't get to race.  No job = no money = no racing.  Blah.

      Woohoo!  Solid food. So I am feeling better and even ate something.  Can't eat much.  Weird to be totally stuffed and still starving at the same time. I gotta get off my butt and take the mid-term online for my Econ class.  I am not looking forward to it.  Econ is totally out of my realm of understanding.  I am convinced the people who write econ books do not speak english.  It is just as hard if not harder than math.  The show went well the other weekend and the band keeps sounding better. A ton of new songs have been added and the set lists are really good now.  Mark has a new toy.  He got one of those "talk boxes".  Don't ask me to describe it if you don't know what it is.  I can't describe it very well.  it just makes a really great new sound and now they can do a bunch of songs that require it.  It is raining again. Hardly rains all winter and now we are having all the good storms.  I keep wanting to plant my garden but have to wait.  These storms have been friggin' cold!  We keep going from hot summer weather to winter over night and I have really had enough.  Every time I start to put my winter gear away I have to drag it back out.

      I ate something that did not like me yesterday. I have spent the last 19 hours puking so it will be a short update today.  The makers of French's Mustard made the following recent statement:   "We at the French's Company wish to put an end to statements that our  product is manufactured in France. There is no relationship, nor has  there ever been a relationship, between our mustard and the country  of France. Indeed, our mustard in manufactured in Rochester, NY.  The only thing we have in common is that we are both yellow".

      I decided to include the definitions of the moderate and high ratings I got.  Apprently my personality is pretty disordered.  Antisocial A common misconception is that antisocial personality disorder refers to people who have poor social skills. The opposite is often the case. Instead, antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a lack of conscience. People with this disorder are prone to criminal behavior, believing that their victims are weak and deserving of being taken advantage of. They tend to lie and steal. Often, they are careless with money and take action without thinking about consequences. They are often agressive and are much more concerned with their own needs than the needs of others.   Obsessive-Compulsive Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder is similar to obsessive-compulsive anxiety disorder. People with this disorder are overly focused on orderliness and perfection. Their need to do everything "right" often interferes with their productivity. They tend to get caught up in the details and miss the bigger picture. They set unreasonably high standards for themselves and others, and tend to be very critical of others when they do not live up to these high standards. They avoid working in teams, believing others to be too careless or incompetent. They avoid making decisions because they fear making mistakes and are rarely generous with their time or money. They often have difficulty expressing emotion.  Histrionic People with histrionic personality disorder are constant attention seekers. They need to be the center of attention all the time, often interrupting others in order to dominate the conversation. They use grandiose language to discribe everyday events and seek constant praise. They may dress provacatively or exaggerate illnesses in order to gain attention. They also tend to exaggerate friendships and relationships, believing that everyone loves them. They are often manipulative.   Narcissistic Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by self-centeredness. Like histrionic disorder, people with this disorder seek attention and praise. They exaggerate their achievements, expecting others to recongize them as being superior. They tend to be choosy about picking friends, since they believe that not just anyone is worthy of being their friend. They tend to make good first impressions, yet have difficulty maintaining long-lasting relationships. They are generally uninterested in the feelings of others and may take advantage of them.  Avoidant Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by extreme social anxiety. People with this disorder often feel inadequate, avoid social situations, and seek out jobs with little contact with others. They are fearful of being rejected and worry about embarassing themselves in front of others. They exaggerate the potential difficulties of new situations to rationalize avoiding them. Often, they will create fantasy worlds to substitute for the real one. Unlike schizoid personality disorder, avoidant people yearn for social relations yet feel they are unable to obtain them. They are frequently depressed and have low self-confidence.

      There are some of these online quizzes that are just too funny.   I got bored and so I decided to take a few and post the results.  So an 54% pure woman is doomed to the 5th level of hell and is narcissistic, avoidant, antisocial, and histrionic.  You would think that I seriously sucked as a human being.  On a crappy note I have managed a serious cold thing.  I have never in my life produced so muc snot in such a short period of time.  On a great note I spent an hour on the phone interviewing for a position.  I was told I will be called tomorrow to schedule and on site interview for early next week. It will be at the same company Mark works at but at a different site.  God bless nepatism and that it is alive and well in the silly valley!

      The wretched King Minos has decided your fate. His tale wraps around his body 5 times. The sweet light no longer strikes against your eyes. Your shade has been banished to... the Fifth Level of Hell!   Fifth Level of Hell  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The river Styx runs through this level of Hell, and in it are punished the wrathful and the gloomy. The former are forever lashing out at each other in anger, furious and naked, tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth. The latter are gurgling in the black mud, slothful and sullen, withdrawn from the world. Their lamentations bubble to the surface as they try to repeat a doleful hymn, though with unbroken words they cannot say it. Because you lived a cruel, vindictive and hateful life, you meet your fate in the Styx.

      Last week Mark and I were watching a show on Tech TV about old video games and he suddenly had a nostalgic moment. This led to his immediatley logging into eBay and doing some shopping. He remembered the good old days of Nintendo and his love of Mario Bros.  We now have an old Nintendo system and a bunch of games including every Mario Bros. ever made.  He doesn't talk much anymore.  He just kinda sits in from of the TV with his new found old love battling the Koopa's.   Lucky for me he decided that since he was getting all this stuff he should get me something to  :o). As he racked his brain for idea's a memory hit him. The memory was of me at Hardcore's new years party, planted in a recliner, playing Bass Fishing for hours on his Sega Dreamcast system.  So a Dreamcast system has also arrived and soon I might even get a chance in front of the tube to play it.  Mark's been spending today playing Crazy Taxi.  It is fun and I am glad we have them.  Barely passed my mi-term yesterday.  Got a lousy 70%.  Econ sucks.  I have no problem understanding the theories and logic but the graphs have me totally lost. If I do well on the final I should be able to squeeze a B out of the class though.  Not what I was hoping for and I am a bit disappointed.  Today was dang nice out. Was a tank top and shorts day. It was nice enough I finally got off my duff and planted this summers garden.  We have carrots, green beans, crooked neck squish, cherry tomato's, beef steak tomato's, and watermelons just for fun.  In the fromt yard we had this big dirt spot that was driving me nuts.  So I planted some daisy bushes there that will hopefully fill it up and look awful pretty too in pink and purple.

      Well, I have made it to round two.  The interview this morning went well and they will be calling me to schedule an interview with the next higher person in the food chain.

      Wish me luck!  I have an interview tomorrow morning at 10:00am.  Will let you know how it goes tomorrow afternoon.  For now, todays funny!  FEMALE PRAYER:  Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray for a man, who's not a creep, One who's handsome, smart and strong, One who loves to listen long, One who thinks before he speaks, When he says he'll call, he won't wait weeks. I pray that he is gainfully employed, When I spend his cash, won't be annoyed. Pulls out my chair and opens my door, Massages my back and begs to do more. Oh! Send me a man who'll make love to my mind, Knows what to answer to "How big is my behind?" I pray that this man will love me to no end, And never attempt to hit on my friend. And as I kneel and pray by my bed, I look at "who" you sent me instead. Amen.   MALE PRAYER:   I pray for a nympho with huge boobs who owns a liquor store. Amen.

      Told you an update was coming soon!!  I got the job!  I started working at Perclose, A Division of Abbott Laboratories on May 20.  So now Mark and I work for the same company, http://www.abbott.com , different divisions, at different sites.  He works in the Santa Clara office and I work in Redwood City.  Things are going well and I think I will be perm in four to six months.  An old friend got a hold of me yesterday, Brian Dezember.  I swear we have known each other since I was 12 or 13 years old. I haven't talked to him in ten years.  We spent a couple of hours on the phone filling each other in on our lives and who we knew what about.  Turns out the guy I went to my senior prom with went in a direction nobody ever expected.  A few years ago my prom date took over a room at a Pismo Beach hotel and held six people hostage! Can I pick them or what!  Four weeks after I get a job and over two months after I submitted my resume for a job opening they had, Google finally wants to interview me. Wish I was brave enough to go for it.  Google is a damn awesome place to work. They are high tech though.  Even though they are doing VERY well now and have been surviving the dot bomb in style it would still be a bit to unstable for me.  I am tired of risk taking in the job department. I will be sticking with the nice, stable, 115 year old company in the biotech industry.  I am still going to the interview with Google though  :o).  It would just be super cool and a huge ego/confidence booster if they offered me a position.  One of my favorite people is engaged.  Charles asked his vegetarian girlfriend to marry him in the middle of a steakhouse. Gads I love the way he does things.  He has a big heart, the best of intentions, and is a great friend. I am totally thrilled for Charles and his wife to be Sara.  Even better, they are buying a nice house just a hop, skip, and a jump from mine so I expect we will be around each others BBQ's quite regularly.

      So, I am graduating with an A.S. in Busines Management with and option in Business Marketing from Allan Hancock College.  It has been totally anticlimatic and I have gotten no presents.  Not even a crappy e-card.  It took me 12 years to do this.  You would think it was some kind of accomplishment.  I expected it to be a bit more exciting.  Then again, it did take me 12 years to do 3 years worth of work.  Maybe when it takes you a long time people figure it's about time you got off your lazy duff and finally finished something you started.  Ho Hum...

      Gads have I been totally neglecting my blog or what!  Time flys I guess.  I got my purple belt and will probably be testing for my blue belt in six to eight months.  Each belt takes longer and lobger to get. The rest of June was pretty blah.  Same stuff, different day.  Not much to say about July.  I bought my Mom a new computer as a combo Mom's day and Birthday present.  We went to the World Superbike races at Laguna Seca. It's the annual migration of sportbikes and their riders from aruond the world.  I get to meet people face to face who I spend all year e-mailing.  It is just great.  I had actually planned on not going this year.  I am so sick of the crowds and couldn't afford the time off from work to do it right.  When it came down to it though I just couldn't resist the call.   Next year I will give in completely.  The plan will be to camp at the track and be a corner worker. Best seat in the house!  Not only do you get to see every race, but you become a part of the action. That is just plain full of cool factor and bragging rights.  August had some ups and downs. Up - Marks 40th birthday was just friggin' awesome!  I couldn't have done it all without my neighbor, Tina.  She was a HUGE help.  Everyone had a great time and people Mark hasn't seen in a long time were in attendance.   DOWN - A dear friend of mine was diagnosed with testicular cancer.  He will be fine but it will be a long road to cure and recovery. He's the only guy I know who can make cancer just plain funny. He has been keeping a daily blog so all his friends can keep up on how he's doing which I read every day.  He so tired I don't want to bother him with phone calls and visits and such. Up - Our friends Greg and Cindy Creech got married http://www.creechparty.org . Mark's band, http://www.moxierox.com , played the wedding and it was a great success. Down - I lost count on how many people asked me if Mark and I had set a date yet.  I had no idea how many people payed such close attention to our relationship. Up - I dodges the boquet, Mark dodged the garter.  Sorry kids, we will do what we do when we do it, if we do it at all.   This summer I upgraded the 'ol beat the heat redneck jacuzzi.  http://www.thinkaero.com/retail/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=Aero&category%5Fname=Aero+Sports&product%5Fid=Mega+Quick+Pool The Aero Mega Quick Pool  Our largest pool ever! A full 144" in diameter Holds 750 gallons of water Octagon shape provides huge swim area Rechargeable Ni-Cd Pump included Inlates in 3.5 minutes Deflates in one minute  Plenty of room for all and great when the heat is on.  Even came with a great fitted cover.  Not much to say about September.  So far, it is the same.  Go to work, go home, go to work, go home, blah. I bought some squid stickers for the R6 to dress it up a little. You can see pictures at the the link on the lower right side of the page that says Pics of Us.  It will be in the folder named 2001 YZF600 R6.  That's about it for now.  I will try to be less neglectful of my blog.

      Just talked to the shop.  The estimate for parts is at $2500 and they are not even done with parts yet!  Labor is next at $80 an hour.  Man is that woman in for a shock.

      Taking my bike into the shop tomorrow for the estimate. Damn I hope nothing serious is messed up. I am hoping to get the check for the full cost of parts and labor and fix it myself.  My most trusted mechanic lives in Canada and cannot get here until Christmas and I do not trust to many people with my bike. Pretty much I trust Mark and my Canadian friend Shawn. Shawn has done ALL the major things on my bike. Mark and I have handled the general maintenance and such.

      Tonight I had kickboxing class. I needed it.  I am still pretty pissed about my bike and needed the fight time to work it off. The joys of sparring.  You get to hit people and it feels soooooo good. The down side.  They hit back.  Even worse, sometimes they hit you pretty hard. My jaw is swelling as I type this and it is hurting.  I feel better than I have since my bike got assaulted though.  Maybe I will have a cool bruise on my face tomorrow  :o).

      Just to add insult to injury I suppose.  When I finally checked my snail mail last night, my bike registration bill from the DMV arrived.  Sheesh!  Did I do something horrible in a past life or something?

      So there I am, working away at my desk.  Karen comes up with this serious face and says, "I don't know how to tell you this.  Your bike is laying on its side." You have never seen a girl run so fast.  I didn't know how strong I was. In one big swoop I had literally tossed my baby back up on two wheels. Visable damage says 2000 - 5000 USD in damage. I ma still shaking with fury.  Thank goodness for witnesses who come forward.  We got her, she will pay.  I was good, no tears until I got 11 miles from the office.  I had decided to limp my baby home bent parts and all.  The last 20 miles to my house was uncontrollable sobbing like a little girl.  Bitch has been driving a compact car forever.  She just bought a big ass SUV. And backed it over my bike.  Pushing it OVER the kickstand onto its left side.  Left side is fucked up.  Fairings cracked all over the place.  Shift linkage all bound up. Ding in swingarm. Left clip on bent to shift along with clutch, fairing stay, and mirror.   When the police called her, she fessed up.  I had her on speaker.  She was 40 feet from my cube where she hit my bike.  She apologized a lot.  She said she KNEW it was my bike.  The fucking bitch drove away KNOWING I was 40 feet away and left my baby on its side!!!    Cried all the way home, finally stopped bawling, adreniline wore off, puked up my shoes. Today sucks. I ride that thing like a little old lady in the hills, detail it three times a year, clean it and polish it ALL the time, do ALL the maintenace by the book, record EVERY fuel stop.  It is the first thing of real value I have ever owned.  it's the ONLY thing.  it was the first bike I bought that I did not have to assemble or repair before riding.  It was the first one that EVERY SINGLE DIME in it was mine.  And this bitch runs it over like yesterdays trash!  What the fuck is wrong with people!?!?!? Someone make me understand, please. I simply cannot put into words what that bike means to me. Burn my house down but save the bike. Break my legs but save the bike. Take everything from me, but leave me my bike. It is a part of my being. Without my bike a part of me is missing. I can try and explain it all day but nobody will ever understand the true gravity of it.   Pictures to be posted when I calm down.

      I have always suspected the people if California lacked common sense and a basic level of intelligence.  If the dumb jock wins, my suspicions will be proven and the joke will be on California.  Mark quit the band.  He got tired of their lack of motivation and all around laziness.  Or maybe I did.  They all agree they need to do this and that and then nobody will do anything they say they need to do.  Oh well, it was a great band.  Mark went to the doc recently.  He is still my big, strong, healthy man.  I could have told him that for free.  :o)  The claim adjustor for AAA, the asshat who ran over my bike, came by and took pics of the damage today.  Hopefully this will translate into a check soon.  I am also getting reimbursed for the cost of insuring and registering a friends bike so I could have wheels while I wait for repairs.  My two favorite words since my bike got hit.  Asshat and fucktard. They are the best description I can come up with for the twit since the bike assault.  I have come to the conclusion that my job really and truely sucks.  I am actively seeking employment ANYWHERE else.  If I get lucky they will end my contract.  Umemployment and retraining courtesy of the state of California.  I want to go back to school for something else.  Thinking phlebotomy.  I get to impale people's bodies all day with needles and play with blood.  Who could ask for anything more?  Mark and I have decided California sucks too.  We have a plan.  In two years we want to be living in Medford, Oregon. Mom is willing to move too!!  Good thing, I don't think I could handle living thar far from Mom.  I have grown up to be a big Momma's girl.

      I'm tellin' ya.  When it rains, it pours.  Marks Triumph blew up today.  I think he needs to get rid of that crumpet burning British piece of shit and buy some good solid Japanese engineering.  A nice R1 or maybe the new CBR1000. Good, solid, dependable, Japanese engineering.  Then all you have to do is watch out for some asshat bitch backing over it.  At least you can count on the motor.  Say what you will about rice burners but I have never had one let me down in the motor department.

      Not much going on.  Asshats insurance company put the check in the mail today so I could get my bike fixed.  I am still pretty depressed and a lot bent about the whole thing.  It's gonna take at least a week to get my bike into the shop and then there will be the parts fiasco to look forward to.  I have never had a large parts order go well.  Stupid people always mess something up, something else ends up on back order, yadda, yadda, yadda.  Mark and I have decided to do a super cheap Christmas this year.  No cool presents from my honey for me :o(.  The plan is to throw the money at bills instead so we can buy a house in Medford, Oregon in two years.  We are both sick of California.  Gonna have to decide on a budget for family Christmas gifts as well.  Planning to do Thanksgiving at my house again this year.  Mom will come up, and we will invite a few of our orphan friends.  I had a ball doing it last year and I am looking forward to doing it again this year.

      I was right.  Came home today and Mark had that silly "I've been riding the SuperHawk" grin on his face.  Decision has been made and we have another bike in the garage.  Now all we need to do is put the Triumph back together and sell it.

      I bought pumpkins today.  I found a way to keep myself from spending 80 bucks on them. Two back packs and you take the bikes to the pumpkin patch.  That limits me to two pumpkins and they must fit in the back pack.  It also gets some great looks when you pull up to the pumpkin patch on bikes.  They really wonder how you're gonna get those things home.  Invited my favorite neighbor kids over to help clean and carve them.  I know its a bit early and they may not make it to halloween but I sure had a ball. Besides, I had planned on cleaning house.  It needs it, but I didn't want to do it.  Quality time with a pumpkin is much better.

      One of my hero's, Charles, was generous enough to loan us his SuperHawk for Mark to ride while we repair the Triumph.  I think it is a trick.  He is considering selling this pristine hooligan machine that loves to wheelie.  He knows we are tired of the Triumph and wish to replace it. Mark keeps finding excuses to take it out today. He says he is going to pick something up, leaves, comes back an hour later, and has nothing! He does have something, a silly grin on his face.  he likes the hooligan SuperHawk.  I would not be surprised if we find it permanently parked in our garage soon.  It amazes me that with all that Charles is dealing with right now that he takes the time to think of us and offer up his bike for Mark. He is a great friend that Mark and I are VERY lucky to have.  People like Charles are very few.

      Well, we know why the Triumph failed.  It broke a valve spring. The real damage was done when the broken valve spring caused a chunk of the head to be broken.  We haven't looked at the bottom end yet for damage but it is possible the top of the piston is messed up an will need replacement. So we are currently looking for a whole motor, just the top end, or a head, whatever we can get.  Parts for British bikes are a bitch to find.  I ordered the parts for my bike yesterday. It always feels weird writing a $1500 check. That much money is just plain scary.  I am always trying so hard not to spend money, to get out of debt, to be able to buy things I like. I pinch and save like crazy just to buy a new piece of riding gear.  It just makes it weird to write such a big check. Either way, if they don't screw up, I should be able to have my baby back on the road by next weekend.  I officially started looking for a new job.  Mine sucks.  Well, my job doesn't suck, the place I work sucks big time. I have never worked in a place so damn uptight.  If those people tried to fart their collective heads would explode. Oh my gosh, I have finally found the word to describe the drones at the office.  The collective. Like the Borg on Star Trek.  You know the place you work sucks when your immediate supervisor helps you beef up your resume and is constantly sending you links to job listings he thinks you should apply for. He also helps cover so you can do interviews and stuff.  Gads he is super cool. I hope he finds himself a good job too.  We are both looking and he is a great supervisor.

      What a long weekend.  Lot's of fun though.   Friday night. My neighbor, Tina, was in charge of her kids school Fall Festival.  It is this huge fund raising carnival they hold every year.  So she asked me if I could take her kids so they could have some fun. Then the DJ cancelled and we roped Mark into DJ'ing for them.  Then one of the volunteers flaked at the last minute and so Pete, Tina's husband, ended up covering that spot. So all was well. I arrive with a 7 year old cheerleader and a 2 year old skunk.  I also picked up a couple of other kids, sans costume, while I was there. I got loads of compliments on Johns skunk costume and both the kids were angels. It was funny how many people told me how much John looked like me. I have brownish blondish hair and blue eyes.  John has brown eyes and brown hair. I guess people want to see what they want.  That kid doesn't look anything like me. We ran around all night playing games and eating serious amounts of junk food.  The little buggers didn't go to bed until midnight and had a ball.  Marks first words to me when we got home were "You want one of those?!?".  The older kids were driving him nuts.  The girls had that miss thang attitude and the boys were being all macho and demanding. I won't be talking him into a baby anytime soon.  Thanks a lot you brats.  Saturday I got to sleep in.  Then I was supposed to have John and Kayla from 1:30 to 10:00pm.  I got lucky.  Didn't get John until 2:00 and Kayla stayed with her friend until 8:00. John was cute as ever and a total angel all day.  That's a pretty rare thing to get cute and behaved that long out of a 2 year old.  They are always cute. They do go through tornado phase quite a bit though. Trying to keep up with them and clean up after them is pointless. I just let them make a mess and clean when they are asleep or gone. John really redeemed children in the eyes of Mark Saturday.  Sunday has been spent all day on the bike.  It is so blazing hot that you work for 30 minutes and then go sit for an hour.  Mark I got all the body work off, replaced the pegs, peg mount, and clutch lever.  As long as the bike is totally stripped I decided it would be a good time to wash it real good.  Bike is cleaner than its been since the day I rode it out of the dealers parking lot.

RAIN-X - I put the Happy Holidays thingy in the front window - We stop leaving the front door open all day - We sit under the comforter on the couch instead of useing it as a pillow - I break out the flannel PJ's - Mark wears his sweats and Uggs all day on the weekends

      Today I had a wonderful  un-birthday surprise. My neighbor somehow convinced herself that my birthday was in October and she had forgotten it. So yesterday she ran out and did all kinds of shopping to buy me a gift and card. Today she comes by with four wrapped gifts and a wonderful card. It was the sweetest thing.  In gift one, several Hershey's milk chocolate bars. Gift two, graham crackers. Gift three, marshmellows. Gift four brings it all together, a s'mores maker!!  http://tinyurl.com/vrxp   The whole thing really made my day. Mark, Tucker and I just finished testing the s'more maker. The tests have gone well, but I think there will be further tests in the near future.  :o)  Shouder Update:  Feelling pretty good today. A bit sore where the bruise is but the bruise is smaller now and not quite as purple.

      So my friggin' shoulder is still awful sore today so I did a little research. Doctors lie! A little sore for a few hours my ass. This is what I found here http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/paindrugs/a/cortisone.htm  Are there side effects? Yes. Probably the most common side-effect is a 'cortisone flare,' a condition where the injected cortisone crystalizes and can cause a breif period of pain worse than before the shot. This usually lasts a day or two and is best treated by icing the injected area.  Two days!! This could be more annoying than the normal pain and it will be that way for two whole days!

      Whoever said cortizone was great stuff was a liar! I suppose this could use a bit more explanation. On Friday, June 14, 2002, I crashed at Thunderhill Raceway http://www.thunderhill.com/ . I landed on my face and left shoulder.  They tell me I was out cold for about half a minute or so. I couldn't tell you though.  I remember most of the crash but I am missing a few minutes of time from that day. Since that crash my shoulder has never felt right. It aches all the time and sometimes hurts so bad I consider going to the emergency room to beg for demerol or morphine. In October 2002 I decided to see and orthopedic doctor for it.  I figured if it wasn't better by then there must be something wrong. What I got mostly was lip service. The doc pretty much pat me on the head and sent me out the door with a pescription for Celebrex and an appointment for physical therapy. So, 12 weeks of physical therapy go by and I never really noticed a diference. I was in no mood to go back to a doc who explained nothing and gave me no options.   So here I am, a year later.  Shoulder still hurts. Last week I went three days trying not to move it at all it was hurting so bad. A friend recommends a doc and I figure I got nothing to lose so I will give this new doc a try.  He has explained a lot, he has given me options, he started today with the easiest option. The man shot me up full of cortizone and tells me I will be a bit sore for a few hours. What he should of said was hold on to your hat girl, you're gonna me miserable. What is it with docs always down playing shit? I was prepared for being a little achy tonight.  I was not prepared for don't touch me, don't talk to me, I want my Mommy miserable.  Have you ever gotten a cortizone shot? It is just plain weird. They use a considerably large needle and I am talking not just long but dang the thing is thick! They give you a mix of cortizone and lidocane so it goes kinda numb and doesn't hurt right away. It goes in like a boulder and feels like it is gonna explode out of your skin! Later you find you have this nice 2 inch diameter purple bruise where they stuck that huge ol' needle in.  Anyways, doc says this may not help at all, this may fix the problem forever, or this may only work for a few weeks. I need to call him and gove weekly reports.  Depending on what the results are, I might get an MRI. The most invasive thing that may or may not happen is they go in and carve off a piece of the bone.  Gads I hope this does the trick. Although I would probably get a really cool scar out of it.  :o)

      Since the day I bought my R6 I have wanted an alarm system for it. After having some beast of a bitch back over it and drive away I have gone out and got me one. Mark installed it a few days ago and it is great! I have a standard alarm plus a perimeter sensor and a paging system.  This way, alarm goes off, I get paged, I catch the beast who is so stupid as to touch my machine.  I figure what's the fun in preventing the theft or damage of your bike if you can't beat the living hell out of the fool. After much research I decided on the Scorpio alarm system made by Aritronix http://www.aritronix.com/cyl200order.htm .                                                     Next step is all the carbon fiber bits I have wanted for so long.  If you are feeling generous you can get me a gift certificate for this site  http://www.tricktape.com/subcat.asp?0=325  and help me make my machine look just like the vision I have for it.  Remember kids, Christmas is coming and my birthday will be right after that. Nothing says love like carbon fiber bits for my bike.                                       I broke my no sticker rule for my bike recently as well. I just couldn't help myself. When I saw it I knew that was her.  The personality that I have in my vision of my bike. I will post pictures soon. It is a great shot of Bettie Page in a red leather outfit.  She was a beautiful and controversial model in the 1940's and 1950's.   http://www.bettiepage.com/about/bio.html                                If you are looking for gift idea's for Christmas and birthday you can't go wrong with an                http://www.amazon.com gift certificate   or                             http://www.aerostich.com/riderwearhouse.store  gift certificate   or                              http://tinyurl.com/w9tw  from QVC.  I had the foodsaver one and it stunk. Stupid thing worked great first 3 months I had it. I even sent it in for repairs. I finally gave in and sent it to the landfill.  I have a lot more faith in the Cook's Essentials products.                                                   Last but not least.  Shoulder update.  Feeling pretty good so far.

      The word of the day kids is POOP. Unbelievable, amazing, nuclear milk chocolate fondue poop. I have finally found something that can make Mark gag courtesy of the diaper offerings of a two year old.  Friday afternoon Mark and I were watching the neighbors little tornado John.  You can tell he adores Mark. He will sit with Mark and do nothing for an hour or more. He won't do that for me or anyone else. It is damn cute to watch the two of them.  Well, Mark and John were sitting in the music room playing with Mark's new digital mixing board. I stopped in to check on them. As we were talking both my nose and Mark's detected an indescribable stench. On investigation and much sniffing about the culprit was identified. The stench was emanating from the back side of a certain little boy. If we knew the stench was bad, but we had no clue what we were in for.  I went to do a diaper check and quickly found my fingers covered in milk chocolate, oh my god this stinks, poop. Let's just say I finally found the cure for nail biting. Since that moment I have washed by hands multiple times, applied rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxoide, and my fingers have not come near my face.   So I carried, at arms length, John to the bathroom where I removed his poop staind shirt and pants. Oh my god!  You know how on the side of the diaper box it says 10 to 12 pounds.  Well kids, I am here to tell you that is exactly all they will hold. Not one ounce more. This kid had loaded this diaper so full it was bulged out to his knees and poo was seeping out the top and bottom. I had no desire to remove it.  If it had been summer time I would have hauled that kid into the yard and hit him with the hose. I had Mark open all the doors, open the trash can lid, and clear a path.  Once he hollered the all clear I scooped up the kid, at arms length, and hauled him and his deadly butt out to the trash can. As soon as I got that nuclear waste containing diaper off that kids behind, Mark began gaging, choking and spitting. The poor mans eyes were watering and his nose was running.  I dang near fell over laughing and holding my nose. Of course John thought it was all funny as heck and was giggling like only a two year old can.  The rest is pretty boring. Once again I scooped up our foul smelling, giggling little friend - at arms length - and off to the bath tub we went.  Got stink boy all cleaned up. Needless to say, I think it will take a while before I can bring up having a brat of our own because of this. Mark has no desire to encounter such a diaper again.  :o)

      Ok, because I can't stand lying to my Mom but I don't have the nerve to tell anyone I am putting it up here.  I am amazed that I have kept it up this long. I am getting over the whole loser feelling though so I should just tell the world and be done with it.  I am unemployed again. I got laid off October 20, 2003. Yet again I garner a great reference, but no long term employment.  It sucks. No, I don't want to talk about it and I would appreciate it if you could avoid bringing up the whole thing. I said I was getting over it, but I am not over it yet.  I'll let you know when I care to talk about it.  What a lovely resume: - Laid off Jan. 15, 2002  (Happy Birthday, now get out) - Luck out and get a low wage temp job with no benefits in March 2002 - Laid off Feb. 14, 2003  (Happy Valentines Day, now get out) - Luck out again and start working at another low wage temp job with no benefits May 20, 2003 - Laid off October 20, 2003 (Happy Halloween, now get out)  So now everyone knows, I don't have to hide anything or lie. This sucks. Christmas will be quite cheap this year.  NO gift buying for everyone. Growing up it was about what I got. Then there was the phase of not caring either way.  Then one day I get a decent job, I am doing well, and I find I love giving gifts. Not being able to give gifts this year blows.

      So what's been happening since November 23rd?  We had a wondeful Thanksgiving dinner here with a small gathering of family and friends. I went a little baking crazy though. I made two pies for my kickboxing school and four for the Thanksgiving dinner. I made chocolate pie, apple pie, pumpkin pie, and pecan pie. The turkey was grilled in the big weber BBQ and was juicy, juicy!!  On Saturday morning, 11/27/03, Mark set off on his SaddleSore 1000 ride.  This is just one of the many Iron Butt Association rides a person can do, http://www.ironbutt.com/about/default.cfm .  The SaddleSore 1000 is 1000 miles in 24 hours.  I slept through his leaving in the wee hours of the morn.  Good thing too.  Turns out I wouldn't sleep again for the next 24 hours.    He and his co-worker/buddy dave got the wild idea to go north, to Ugene, Oregon and back for this ride.  Brave, brave, men they are. There is a reason why birds go south in the winter. Anyway, north they went.  Shortly outside of the Bay Area they met rain.  Then they spent the next 14 hours in it.  Gear soaked completely through, cold as cold gets, they kept going. I would have come home. They made it as far as Medford, Oregon and had a short visit with Marks Aunt and Uncle. At that point they decided north sucked. They would head back south and then over shoot San Jose and back track to make up for the 200 miles they lost not going to Ugene.    I sat at home all day waiting for the phone to ring. With the weather like it was I needed regular check ins from Mark so I knew all was ok.  What I didn't realize is that I would also sit up all night waiting for those same phone calls.  At 1:00am, 18 and a half hours after leaving, Mark arrived home for a pit stop.  I put everything he had in the drier, started some hot tea, and him in a hot shower.  By 1:30am he was back on the road with Dave headed for Paso Robles and back to get those last 200 miles.  They were thrilled to be out of the rain and it didn't appear there would be any rain for the rest of the trip.  At 4:00am I heard the sound of rain drops on the window and couldn't stop laughing.  Those poor guys were gonna get rained on again.    At 6:30am Mark called me from Salinas, they had gotten a little over 1000 miles done in 24 hours.  They were in Salinas and would be home in about an hour.  That's when I finally got to go to sleep.  I do not even remember Mark coming home.  I am so proud of him.  I sure as heck would not have kept on going through 14 hours of rain and massive gear failure like his.    Since Thanksgiving I have kept busy sewing things and baking stuff.  I have made some banana muffins, lots of cookies, and a couple of baby quilts for friends. I am going to make a cover for Marks new sound board this week.  Last weekend Mark and I got our Christmas Tree set up and decorated.  Then we hung the house lights and nailed the wreaths up.  It looks great and now it is all Christmassy here.  Mark got a promotion at work.  He is getting a raise and a real office with walls and a door!  No more cube farm dwelling for him. He is now the cost accounting manager.

      School started this week and I am already buried in homework.  The good news is that I will have finished the last class I need to graduate from college by March 26.  I have an interview next week with a good company in Palo Alto! It is gonna be one of those marathon gang interviews lasting 4 ours! Nothing like being in an uncomfortable outfit being hammered with questions for half a day. Hopefully it won't suck. best of all it is not a contract position.  It is a full time, benefits and everything job with room for growth and advancement in the company.  The environment is exactly my type of place.  In the summer the CEO wears shorts with holes in them!  I.T. people can be found napping under there desks, and jeans and t-shirts rule. They have some great perks and I can have purple hair again, woohoo!  Wish me luck!

      It has been one heck of a busy three weeks since my last post!  I got some of the best news I could have ever gotten a couple of days before Christmas.  My friend, Charles, is all done with chemo!!  The cancer is all gone and now he just has to eat, grow hair, gain strength, and get healthy.  WooHoo!!!  I got some bad news yesterday.  Every year since my friends Eric and Lissa brought home Rainbow I have watched her when they would go out of town. Rainbow is a beautiful green wing macaw. She had been neglected, injured, and abused by her previous owners.  Eric and Lissa worked miracles with her. I really loved that bird. Yesterday Rainbow passed away. Eric and Lissa are very hurt and sad. I remember how it felt when I lost Asta.  I wish I could do something to make them feel better.  I am going to miss Rainbow a lot.  I had a house full for Christmas and it was wonderful.  I cooked a 15 pound prime rib for all to enjoy. My Mom stayed for a few days and brought up loads of meat.  My freezer is full again.  One of my all time favorite people flew down for the holidays from Canada.  The weather sucked so we didn't get to do much riding. We all became masters of the nap. Nobody can nap like we can!  For a while I thought my house had become the drop in place.  It seemed like every time I blinked, somebody else was walking in the front door.  I loved every minute of it and boy am I glad its over!  I had a great holiday, saw many friends, fed everyone and then some, and even scored some nice gifts.    Tomorrow I start my get sexy by spring diet and workout regimen.  We'll see how that goes.  I am real good once I get into these things but I have a hell of a time getting started.  Next Saturday I turn 33.  I am not too sure how I feel about that yet.  I just don't feel 33.  It seems so old. I am not that old!

      Sunday afternoon Mark and I rode over to Felton for lunch with Mark's Mom, his brother, and Hiroe at LaBruschetta.  It is a wonderful, tiny little roadside Italian restaurant that they love.  His Mom was in Oregon for Christmas so we were doing the Christmas thing. I got abeautiful bracelet from Joanna and a great Italian cook book. I have been looking at Italian cook books lately.  Mark loves Italian food so I wanted to start trying to cook some of it. His Aunt Linda sent us the most beautiful table cloth and linen napkin set with silver napkin rings. She had embroidered a gorgeous floral design in the middle. I am just thrilled to have it.  She also made me a matching apron with my name embroidered on it.  After lunch I rode home, sat around for a bit and hit the gym. I swam for about 45 minutes and came home. When I got home a friend had called and wanted to go to dinner.  The original idea was to hit the great little chinese place near the house. They were closed so we hit up the great sushi place that is also close by. We had a wonderful dinner with Charles and Sara, came home, and passed out into a food coma. It was really good to see Charles eating so much and looking so energetic. He is recovering from the months of chemo well. He has eyebrows again and his eyes are not sunk into his head.  Monday morning I had my interview with VMware, http://www.vmware.com . I think it went well. Tag team interviews stink though. I met with four different people and all of them asked the same things. There was maybe a one or two question difference between people. It was like having the same interview, with four different personalities. I amglad it is over and I should know something in the next week or two.

      So yesterday was my birthday. I could say that it was a wonderful day surrounded by friends and having fun. I could, but I would be lying.  People for whom I have given my time, energy, and caring to simply have none for me. So a decision has been made. I am done giving.  I am all about number one now kids. Remember that before you pick up the phone to ask me for anything. I don't expect I will have the time anymore.

Why is it that my life is less valued because I ride on two wheels instead of four?  For the last couple of years I have followed several cases where negligent driving, blatant disregard for the laws of driving, or just plain road rage has killed or permanently disabled a rider.  The worst sentence handed down was nine months in county jail with three years probation.  At least now I know what a human life is worth and I know that mine holds less value in the eyes of the law and the majority of the public.

      So my brother called tonight.  What a guy he is.  I told him I didn't  get the job.  That I some how lost out on a 3 in 8 chance.  He was kind enough to inform me of how hiring managers pick among applicants.  They just pick the person who sucks the least.  So I said to him, "this means that I sucked the most?".  He said, "yes".  He has no idea how lucky he is to be 600 miles away right now.

        What is wrong with instructors?!?  Damn fools force fucking group projects down our throats and then get all disappointed when participation is lacking.  They KNOW that 10% of the students will get hammered with 100% of the work in order to maintain a decent grade.  Meanwhile, 90% of the students get credit for the work 10% of the students have busted their ass' to complete.  All this in addition to their regular class work.    I am stuck with an idiot and an asshat this time around.  The idiot has not responded to repeated requests for contact.  We have only seen one post from her and it was to tell us she might be available sometimes, but most of the time she will not.  Gee, wish I had known this was optional.    The asshat is a useless kid who requires heavy duty spoon feeding before he can accomplish anything. It would be easier if he didn't show up at all.  I want to tattoo "I am America's future, be afraid, be very afraid" on his forehead.  The guy shows up for meetings without any preparation, without any thoughts, and without any brain cells.  By the time the meeting has ended I have dictated his work for him, and he STILL doesn't get it.    I am furious.  Before the end of this quarter I will be making sure the instructor gets a full understanding of how furious I am.  I am also going to want a good reason for this group exercise.  I want to know why he places this kind of pressure on the one or two people who are actually going to do a damn thing.

      Below is a copy of a letter a friend of mine sent to a group list we are on.  It surprises me that the media hasn't picked up on this and let it be known.  I am not sure I want a man like this in office.  __________________________________________________________________________  I am having a hard time with the latest pap served up by the democrats.  When bill klinton was running for President, the dem's made a big deal out of how great a man he was for being against the war in Vietnam.  Now that it looks like john kerry is to be their next candidate for the office of Commander in Chief, they are touting his war record while he served in Vietnam.   I respect what John Kerry did while he was in Vietnam, what I hold in disgust is what john kerry did when he returned.   Many do not know or refuse to remember what he and many others did while at a anti-war demonstration in Washington DC, he and others threw their ribbons earned in battle on the ground in front of the White House, they also participated in a very disrespectful demonstration in front of the Iwa-Jima (sp) flag raising Memorial, while displaying the American flag flown upside down.  I for one don't feel such a person should be entrusted with the power to send others into harms way.  What say ye?

      So I guess you're all wondering how the interview went.  One word, bizarre.  It's the first time in my life I had a great time.  Genentech has really come up with an amazing and fun way to evaluate potential employee's.  There were about 15 of us there hoping to fill one of three open positions.  They broke us up into three groups and put an observer at each table.  There were also wandering observers and the moderator of the group interview observing us. It was kind of weird knowing that evrything you say and do was being analyzed.  Not knowing exactly what they were looking for made it a bit hard on the nerves though.  We were given several types of tasks that we had to work on as a group and then one person would present to the class.  Kinda like school, but with higher stakes.  Six of us will be notified sometime near the end of next week that we made it to round two.  So if I make it to round two, I have a 50/50 chance of making it in.  I think I did well with the group exercises.  I don't think I did so well on the written part.  We were given a packet containing five essay questions and three semi-mathmatical questions.  I am sure I blew the math part.  I spent an hour on those things and finally just gave it my best educated guess.  At the end of it all they fed us pizza and soda pops.  Never had an interview where they fed you at the end, or at all.  Even if it was five hours or more.  So, I am not holding out hope for anything. I am in no shape to deal with getting my hopes up and having it all go down the toilet again.  It sure would be nice though.  It is one heck of a great company to work for.

I am not expecting anything and I am not even going to hope.

      So for the last two days my phone will not stop ringing.  I am apparently recruiter bait.  Met with one today, and even got passed on to a company for a phone screen that happened today.  Tomorrow morning I will interview with the company.  I don't want the job.  It is a permanent contract, low wage, no hope of becoming a regular employee, no benefits, no raises, no future.  I am being interviewed along with two other applicants.  They expect to make a decision by tomorrow night.   I will not be answering the phone for a couple of days.  I want to hold out a little hope that Genentech will call me back for round two.  I suspect the company I will be interviewing with tomorrow will want the person they choose to start Monday.  I need to see if I can put this off for a week if they choose me.  The thought of another go nowhere contract job just blows.

I did a ton of searching in stores and catalogs and could not find what I wanted.    So a little while back I drew up what I wanted and presented it to Mark's brother, Eric.  He is an absolute wonder with wood.  There is nothing the guy can't build.  He built my coat rack.  Mark brought it home recently and spent this weekend staining it and putting the hooks on it.  It is now hanging up in my hallway and it is beautiful.  Maybe now I will get my kitchen table back.

      Go Ahead - We Dare You !  Enter Mexico illegally.  Never mind immigration quotas, visas, international law or any of that nonsense.  Once there, demand that the local government provide free medical care for you and your entire family.  Demand bilingual nurses and doctors.  Howdy All,   I got this from a friend, how do you think this would work out if a person were to try it?   _____________________________________________________________________________    Demand free bilingual local government forms, bulletins, etc.  Procreate abundantly.  Deflect any criticism of this allegedly irresponsible reproductive behavior with, "It is a cultural United States thing. You would not understand, pal."  Keep your American identity strong.  Fly Old Glory from your rooftop, or proudly display it in your front window or on your car bumper.  Speak only English at home and in public and insist that your children do likewise.  Demand classes on American culture in the Mexican school system.  Demand a local Mexican driver license.  This will afford other legal rights and will go far to legitimize your unauthorized, illegal presence in Mexico.  Insist that local Mexican law enforcement teach English to all its officers.  Good luck! You'll be demanding for the rest of time. Because it will never happen.  Not in Mexico or any other country in the world besides the United States.

      So my cat has taken to yowling relentlessly for no apparent reason the last couple of weeks.  It wasn't his I am very sick or hurt yowl either.  It was different than his pet me, feed me, go to your room meow though.  Enough to get me thinking I should take him to the vet.  I took him this morning at 10:00am.  We discovered the little bugger has a broken tooth with pulp showing.  No wonder the poor guy was meowing so much. This means we get to knock him out, clean his teeth and pull that tooth.  He is still at the vet now getting all his pre-surgery blood work and such done.  While they got him I am going to have that ugly wart on his paw removed too.  He is gonna be pretty pissed off at me when I get him home today.  I can't wait to see where he shits just to let me know how displeased he is.

      This week is going to be eternally long waiting to hear from Genentech.  I can't remember the last time I interviewed for a job I actually wanted.  Yes I can, 3Com.  Today I am hot, bored, and annoyed.  I have spent a great deal of time busting out this friggin' assignment for the group project and my group, as usual, has been AWOL.  I am going in to see the instructor Tuesday and discuss worse case effects on my grade if I do not participate in the final group assignment.  It's time for the rest of the group to step up and put some real effort into this.  I am tired of carrying them.  Last night Mark and I went over to Sara and Charles house to test out their new hot tub and have a couple of beers.  Wish we could afford to buy a hot tub.  They are damn nice and good for helping you sleep.  Bath tub just doesn't do the trick like a nice hot tub.

      Day 13 of Genentech watch.  Job Update:  Nothing to report.  Another day of phone silence.  Cat Update:  I got him this morning without shedding any of my blood.  He did manage to pee all over me and all the way down the hall to the crate though. Went through surgery well.  He only attacked one person instead of three like last time.  He is home and he is some kind of seriously pissed.  It is only a matter of time before he gets his revenge. I am not looking forward to Friday when I take him in for a wound check and bandage change.  He is gonna be even harder to catch.  Then I get to do it again a few days later to get his stiches out.

      Job Update:  No news from Genentech.  Soon I will lose my mind.  Cat Update:  Surgery tomorrow.  I hope to hell I can catch him without getting scratched to hell and peed on like last time.  I hate showing up at the vet a bloody, wet, stinky, mess.

      A little old lady wanted to join a biker club. She knocked on the door of a local biker club and a big, hairy, bearded biker with tattoos all over his arms answers the door. She proclaims "I want to join your biker club."        The guy was amused and told her that she needed to meet certain biker requirements before she was allowed to join. So the biker asks her "You have a bike?"        The little old lady says "Yea, that's my Harley over there" and points to a Harley parked in the driveway.        The biker asks her "Do you smoke?"        The little old lady says "Yea, I smoke. I smoke 4 packs of cigarettes a day and a couple of cigars while I'm shooting pool."        The biker is impressed and asks "Well, have you ever been picked up by the Fuzz?"        The little old lady says "No, I've never been picked up by the fuzz, but I've been swung around by my nipples a few times."

      WARNING!!  WARNING!!  MEGA-WARNING!!  This is going to be difficult to look at. Very graphic.  http://www.homestead.com/prosites-prs/index.html  People need to quit seeing sanitized war.  They need to see what the enemy is really like. America is full of candy asses and I am sick of it.   This war was declared over before the job was done.  Baby Bush is no better than his daddy.  They only do half the job.  The ignorance and impatience of the American people concerning conflict does not help matters.

       How they vote in the UN.     Below are the actual voting records of various Arabic/Islamic States which are recorded in both the US State Department and United Nations' records:  Kuwait votes against the United States 67% of the time.    Qatar votes against the United States 67% of the time.  Morocco votes against t he United States 70% of the time.  United Arab Emirates votes against the U. S. 70% of the time.  Jordan votes against the United States 71% of the time.  Tunisia votes against the United States 71% of the time.  Saudi Arabia votes against the United States 73% of the time.  Yemen votes against the United States 74% of the time.  Algeria votes against the United States 74% of the time.  Oman votes against the United States 74% of the time.  Sudan votes against the United States 75% of the time.  Pakistan votes against the United States 75% of the time.  Libya votes against the United States 76% of the time.  Egypt votes against the United States 79% of the time.  Lebanon votes against the United States 80% of the time.  India votes against the United States 81% of the time.  Syria votes against the United States 84% of the time.  Mauritania votes against the United States 87% of! the time.     US Foreign Aid to those that hate us:  Egypt, for example, after voting 79% of the time against the United States, still receives $2 billion annually in US Foreign Aid.  Jordan votes 71% against the United States and receives $192,814,000 annually in US Foreign Aid.  Pakistan votes 75% against the United States receives $6,721,000 annually in US Foreign Aid.  India votes 81% against the United States receives $143,699,000 annually in US Foreign Aid.  Perhaps it is time to get out of the UN and give the tax savings back to the American workers who are having to skimp and sacrifice to pay he taxes.

      If You Move To The South..Expect some changes   If you are from the northern states and planning on  visiting or moving to the South, there are a few things you should know that will help you adapt to the difference in  lifestyles:  The North has coffee houses, The South  has Waffle Houses  The North has dating services, The  South has family reunions.  The North has switchblade  knives, The South has Lee Press-on Nails.  The North has  double last names, The South has double first names.  The  North has Indy car races, The South has stock car races.  The North has Cream of Wheat, The South has grits.  The  North has green salads, The South has collard greens  The  North has lobsters, The South has crawdads.  The North has  the rust belt, The South has the Bible Belt..  In the  South: --If you run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in a four-wheel  drive pickup truck with a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help  them, just stay out of their way.  This is what they live for...  Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same  store....do not buy food at this store.  Remember, "y'all" is  singular, "all y'all" is plural, and "all y'all's" is plural  possessive.  Get used to hearing "You ain't from round here,  are ya?"  Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be  instructed later on how to use it.  Don't be worried at not  understanding what people are saying. They can't understand you either.   The first Southern statement to creep into a transplanted  Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective "big'ol," truck or "big'ol" boy. Most Northerners begin their  Southern-influenced dialect this way. All of them are in denial about it.  The proper pronunciation you learned in  school is no longer proper.  Be advised that "He needed  killin" is a valid defense here.  If you hear a Southerner  exclaim, "Hey, y'all, watch this," you should stay out of the way. These are  likely  to be the last words he'll ever say.  If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the smallest accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local  grocery store. It doesn't matter whether you need anything or not. You just have to go there.  Do not be surprised to find  that 10-year-olds own their own shotguns, they are proficient marksmen,  and their mammas taught them how to aim.  In the South, we have found that the best way to grow a lush green lawn  is to pour gravel on it and call it a driveway.  AND REMEMBER:  If you do settle in the South and bear  children, don't think we will accept them as Southerners. After all, if the cat had kittens in the oven, we wouldn't call 'em  biscuits.  Have a good day! Send this to four people that ain't related to you, and I reckon your life will turn into a country music song 'fore you know it.  Your relatives would get a kick out of it too .

      First day at the new job report.  Spent all day in orientation at the South San Francisco headquarters.  Informative but mind numbing as all orientations are.  One of those necessary evils.  The rest of this week I will be at the Redwood City site. This will be where I work normally.  Next week I will be in San Francisco for Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) training and certification.  The following week I will be in Cupertino for Mac OS 10 training and certification.  I will be doing a lot more training as well.  This is just the beginning.  It will be 6 to 8 weeks before I start working wih clients.  All I know is today has exhausted me.  I am so not used to going to work anymore.

      Below is a quote I found on a friends blog that I likes so much I wanted to put it on mine.  I have also included the text of an e-mail from a discussion group I am in.  It is something I simply could not say better myself.  The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to  go on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are.  And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and  chills and it's very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun,  for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they  begin to question, is this real, or is this just a ride? And other  people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, "Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because, this is just a ride..." And we... kill those people."  -Bill Hicks  Now the e-mail from the discussion list.  I just read this article on Yahoo news (included below).  A Vermont nuclear (or as Bush says: nuculer) plant cannot find two missing pieces of a "highly radioactive fuel rod."  Further down the article I read this little quote: "In 2002 a Connecticut nuclear plant was fined $288,000 after a similar loss. That fuel was never accounted for."  So let me get this straight.  You talk about boobs, or spanking your monkey, or vaginas on the radio and you get fined $500,000.  You lose some "highly radioactive fuel rods" at a nuclear plant and you get fined $288,000?  I'm sorry, but am I the ONLY one that thinks this is the most fucked up system on the planet?  Like I've argued before, if you think the government isn't trying to stifle your first ammendment rights, you're dead wrong.  They're making everyone too scared to say anything remotely controversal for fear of getting hit with a half million dollar fine.  Gotta protect the children!!  Fuck the kids.  Raise them yourself.  Change the fucking channel.  "Your kids aren't special." - Bill Hicks  Christ, this shit drives me NUTS!  -Michael   -- Vt. Nuclear Plant Looks for Missing Parts Thu Apr 22,12:43 PM ET  Add U.S. National - AP to My Yahoo!  By WILSON RING, Associated Press Writer  MONTPELIER, Vt. - Engineers at a Vermont nuclear plant searched Thursday for two missing pieces of a highly radioactive fuel rod while experts acknowledged they may never be found.  The operators of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant reported the missing pieces Wednesday, saying they were not where they were supposed to be in the large pool used to store fuel rods.  One of the missing pieces is about the size of a pencil. The other is about as thick but is 17 inches long.  The spent fuel rods are highly radioactive and would be fatal to anyone who came in contact with them without being properly shielded, Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Neil Sheehan said. Spent nuclear fuel could be used by terrorists to construct so-called dirty bombs that would spread deadly radiation with conventional explosives.  "We do not think there is a threat to the public at this point. The great probability is this material is still somewhere in the pool," Sheehan said. The pieces could also have been sent years ago to a testing laboratory or a low-level nuclear waste disposal facility.  The pieces were part of a fuel rod that was removed in 1979 from the Vermont Yankee reactor, which is currently shut down for refueling and maintenance.  The pool where used fuel rods are stored is 40 feet deep and contains 2,789 fuel assemblies.  The pencil-thin fuel rods are 12 feet long and filled with uranium pellets. Sheehan said that the missing pieces might have been cut from longer rods for testing or could have broken when they were removed from the fuel assemblies.  The search for the missing pieces was going to include the use of a remote controlled camera in the pool as well as review of the documents dating back decades that cover shipments and movements of radioactive material.  Sheehan cited the heightened awareness of the need to control nuclear material that followed the Sept. 11 terror attacks. "We don't want this falling into the wrong hands," he said. "This is something we would never take lightly."  Gov. James Douglas, after speaking Wednesday afternoon with the head of the NRC, said he was "very concerned" about the missing fuel at the plant, run by Entergy Nuclear.  "This situation is intolerable," he said.  In 2002 a Connecticut nuclear plant was fined $288,000 after a similar loss. That fuel was never accounted for.  Vermont Yankee is located in the southeastern town of Vernon, on the state lines with Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  The state's Public Safety Department and Homeland Security Unit also were notified of the missing fuel.

      I have found the key to surviving parking and they are cigarettes!  Yesterday morning when I parked, pukey homeless person was on the other end of the block.  Another homeless lady, who was polite, smiled, and said good morning to me, was right behind the bikes.  I asked her what brand she liked to smoke. Then I went the store, bought her a pack, and asked her to keep an eye on my bike.  When I came out at the end of the day she was still there.  All the other bikes had trash and stuff all around them.  You could also see that pukey homeless person had been around as well.  My bike had no trash around it and pukey had been nowhere near it.  Best 5 bucks I have ever spent!

      I HATE San Francisco.  So this week I have to spend my days in down town San Francisco for Microsoft Certified Profesional training. No problem, I can deal with only a week in that crappy, over crowded, dirty city.  WRONG!!  This morning I get all turned around and have a hell of a time just finding the place.  When I find it I spend anothe 20 minutes locating parking.  I get all parked and the damn meter won't take my money.  Nothing like a 40 dollar ticket risk for two bucks worth of parking.  I sure as hell wasn't gonna try and find another place to park though!  So at 8:30am I park the bike and get off to class.  At 10:00am I come out to check on my bike and try to feed the meter.  I am met with a lovely surprise.  Some damn homeless person puked all over the back of my bike!!  It was absolutly nasty.  By now all bike parking is full so I am stuck with leaving the bike where it is.  Who the hell gets so messed up that they are blowing chunks before 10-friggin-A.M.?!?  When I went to leave, it got even better.  I look around and homeless person is nowhere in sight.  I crouch down and remove my disk lock.  Stood up just in time.  Homeless person comes walking by and hurls right in front of my bike!  Splatter on my front tire and rotor, splatter on my shoes. So I just give her the look of astonishment that says "what the hell?".  BIG mistake.  Never, EVER look at a homeless person.  That is just asking for it.  She started flailing her arms about, shaking a fist at me, and calling me jezabell and a few other choice words.  Mostly stuff you would call a hooker and quite a bit of it biblical in nature.  I have come to a few conclusions from my experience. - I have no desire to visit San Francisco for anything, ever. - I have lived a sheltered life - I wish to remain oblivious and be sheltered. - I have never actually been scared before.  It wasn't until I was safely on my way that I realized I was scared. I did not like it. - As scary as the homeless woman was, it is sad that there is no family or anyone who cares enough about her to care for her.

      On May 9th I learned a valuable lesson.  If you are going to ride a sportbike for 3 hours on a sunny Sunday morning, wear sunscreen and tuck your damn shirt in!  I managed to get a lovely strip of 2nd degree burn on my back.  I couldn't wear pants for a week. The 2nd week still hurt a lot.  It finally started peeling the 3rd week and it is not done peeling yet.  I am now in the uber itchy phase.  Something else that sucks.  Today I would be attending my graduation ceremonies... if the damn school had sent me notice of them in time.  I got the letter Monday when I got home from work.  Like 3 days is supposed to be enough time to make arrangements and invite family.    The good news is I have graduated finally.  Nothing like taking 10+ years to finish a two year degree.

      It is Monday, I am tired and my tummy is unhappy.  I hate Monday mornings.  Today I have the whole day for studying. No meetings or training scheduled. You would think that it's a good thing.

      Dang I need to post a lot of stuff but I have been swamped!  Good news, I passed my Mac test with a score of 84%.  I am not real happy about my score but it is well above passing so I will take it.  Now I have started studying for my Windows XP MCP exam.  The biggest news is the company party on May 7th.  I had planned on missing it but was encouraged very strongly by my supervisor to go.  New job, new supervisor, he wants me there, I am there.  All I can say is...  OH MY DOG!!!  I am soooo glad I went.  They had 4 city blocks cyclone fenced off. A carnival with a ferris wheel and everything!  Loads of games.  Everywhere you turned there was excellent food. You couldn't sneeze without running into a bar.  All you could eat, all you could drink, all the fun you could stand, for FREE.  It gets better kids.  There was a huge stadium quality stage set up by Bill Graham Presents with wide screens and everything.  Then the huge surprise.  They had THREE well known chart topping bands. The first act was R&B singer Mary J. Blige.  Second act was Matchbox 20.  The third act was the legendary Sir Elton John!!!!!    All this for just a company party.  I love my new job.  Every few minutes I kept looking at Mark and in this excited, voice of disbelief I would say, "Honey, I WORK here!".  Kickboxing has been slow going lately.  I have been focused on learning everything for my new job.  Sifu says I should have no problem testing for my blue belt this June! From there it will be red, red/black, then black belt.  There's more but I need to get going. I will update again in the next day or so.

      No matter how you feel politically about Ronald Reagan, you just have to feel bad for Nancy.  Usually when you lose a spouse it goes in a whirlwind that takes less than a week, but step by step - spouse dies - arrangements are made - you have ceremony - you say good bye - you bury, burn, or whatever your spouse - you grieve, (without EVERYONE watching a million news cameras trained on your every move) - you move on  I can't imagine how much more pronounced and prolonged the grief of Nancy and her children must be.  How many freaking ceremonies must they go through?  How many times must they stand in front of the cameras to grieve and say goodbye?  Here is the ceremony count so far: 1. California -  at Library  2. California - Ceremony to load him on AirForce 1  3. Washington DC - Ceremony to unload him from the plane and take him to the rotunda  4. Washinton DC - Cermony to remove him from the rotunda and take him to the cathedral  5. Washington DC - Ceremony services at the cathedral  6.

To run his family through the ringer EIGHT times is just wrong.

      My 1 on 1 went very well.  My Supervisor is pleased with how I am doing.  He also said that he has gotten a lot of good feedback about me from the team.  YAY for me!

      I have my first 1 on 1 today with my Supervisor.  I have been doing pretty well and it seems I am harder on myself than they are.  Should be a pleasant experience.  I have lots of room for improvement so we will have much to discuss I am sure.  Today the phones have been a bit easier.  I am a little less lost than the day before.  Still exhausting though.  It will be nice once I get a good flow going.

      Sunburn Update  The burn is 4 weeks old now.  It itches like hell and 80% of it is STILL red and bright pink.  At least it doesn't hurt and scratching feels pretty good.  The 3rd week was very itchy, it had completed the peeling process.  Scratching helped the itch but hurt like hell.  I just couldn't win for losing.  The 2nd week the pain had eased but the peeling had begun.  Peeling was completed by the end of the 2nd week.  New skin was seriously raw and very sensitive. On the upside the pain had mellowed out enough that I could wear pants.  The 1st week can only be described as unbelieveable pain.  Pain all the time, non-stop.  Sleep on tummy with only cool, light, soft sheet over me.  Roll over in my sleep, find myself sitting bolt upright in serious pain and tears running down my face.  Week one was just plain bad.

      So we have some kind of leak under the house.  It's been there a while.  Long enough to form puddles, grow mold, and smell just peachy.  The good news is they do not have to rip up my bathroom.  Even better news, the landlord is handling it all.  Mark and I do not have to sacrifice a days work to stay home with the plumber.  First week of July we are getting new windows in the front of the house.  With all the work being done I am feeling a bit bad about the whole stove thing.  Only half the burners work.  You have to jiggle them and all kinds of futzing around to get them all working.  I think I will wait until the sticker shock from paying for the plumbing and windows wears off before I mention we need a stove too.  I am also very tired.  I have started taking calls at work and the induction period is exhausting.  It takes about three to four weeks to really get a flow going and get all the processes in your head.  I expect to exhausted for about three more weeks.

      I went out to dinner with a friend last night and found a GREAT new restaurant.  All you can eat Japanese.  Very good sushi, sashimi, hot dishes and desserts. It is like the Hometown Buffet but Japanese.  If you ever run across a Todai I suggest you stop and eat.  The atmosphere is as good as the food.

      This weekend was a total waste for me.  Friday night I went to kickboxing and had a good throw down workout.  cam home tired but feeling good.  Saturday I woke up with a sore neck and a bit of a headache.  This turned out to be a bad omen of what was to come.  A migraine of colossal proportions.  I haven't had one this bad in over 5 years.  By 6pm I was in tears and throwing up.    Thank goodness I have one of the world's greatest chiropractors.  I called the office and left a message at about 6:45pm.  At 7pm my phone rang and it was him.  At 7:30pm I was in his office getting some much needed relief from the pain, puking, dizzyness, and general misery.  If he hadn't called I would have gone striaght to the ER and begged for Demerol or Morphine.  Went home, took a hot bath, and went to bed.  Pain was still there but not as bad, dissipating, and now tolerable.  Slept in until 10am Sunday. Saturday had exhausted me.  I spent all day Sunday in bed recovering.  Feeling quite puny and weak.  About 5pm I finally started to perk up a little and even ate dinner.  Today I was still a bit tired and sore.  Felt good enough to go to work though.  Wouldn't have been able to rest at the house anyway with the plumber here all day fixing what turned out to be more leaks than we thought.  More on that later.  Figured I might as well feel crappy at work and get paid for it.  Plumbing fun!  Turns out the big leak that was causing the stink was form the kitchen sink.  Also all the seals on the toilets and showers are leaking.  Plumber got most of it taken care of today.  Tomorrow he comes back to finish up.  I am looking forward to Wednesday myself.  I am going to dinner to dish and gossip with one of my favorite people, Charles.  The best way to describe our friendship would be to say he is my best girlfriend and one of my biggest cheer leaders. Everyone should have a friend like Charles.

      I got this in an email today and I wanted to share it with you all.  ===========================================================  Author unknown   For good and ill, the Iraqi prisoner abuse mess will remain an issue. On the one hand, right thinking Americans will abhor the stupidity of the actions while on the other hand, political glee will take control and fashion this minor event into some modern day My Lai massacre. I heard some Arabs are asking for an apology.    I humbly offer mine here:   I am sorry that the last seven times we Americans took up arms and sacrificed the blood of our youth, it was in the defense of Muslims (Bosnia, Kosovo, Gulf War 1, Kuwait, etc.).   I am sorry that no such call for an apology upon the extremists came after  9/11.  I am sorry that all of the murderers on 9/11 were Arabs.   I am sorry that Arabs have to live in squalor under savage dictatorships.   I am sorry that their leaders squander their wealth.  I am sorry that their governments breed hate for the US in their religious schools.       I am sorry that Yasir Arafat was kicked out of every Arab country and high  jacked the Palestinian "cause".   I am sorry that no other Arab country will take in or offer more than a token amount of financial help to those same  Palestinians.   I am sorry that the USA has to step in and be the biggest financial supporter of  poverty stricken Arabs while the insanely wealthy Arabs blame  the USA.   I am sorry that our own left wing elite and our media can't understand any of this.   I am sorry the United Nations scammed the poor people of  Iraq out  of the "food for oil" money so they could get rich while the common folk  suffered.   I am sorry that some Arab governments pay the families of homicide bombers upon their death.   I am sorry that those same bombers are seeking 72 virgins... I can't seem to find one here on Earth.   I am sorry that the homicide bombers think babies are a legitimate target.   I am sorry that our troops died to free more Arabs.  I am sorry they stopped the gang rape rooms and the filling of mass graves of dissidents.  I am sorry they show so much restraint when their brothers in arms are killed.  I am sorry that Muslim extremists have killed more Arabs than any other group.  I am sorry that foreign trained terrorists are trying to seize control of Iraq and return it to a terrorist state.   I am sorry we don't drop a few dozen Daisy cutters on Fallujah.  I am sorry every time terrorists hide they find a convenient "Holy Site".  I am sorry they didn't apologize for driving a jet into the World Trade Center that collapsed and severely damaged Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church - one of our Holy Sites.  I am sorry they didn't apologize for flight 93 and 175, the USS Cole, the embassy bombings, etc.feed a medium sized village in Africa.   I am sorry the French are French?  America will get past this latest absurdity.  We will punish those responsible because that is what we do.  We hang out our dirty laundry for  all the world to see.  We move on.  That's one of the reasons we are hated so much.  We don't hide this stuff like all those Arab countries that are  now demanding an apology.  Deep down inside, when most Americans saw this reported in the news, we  were like - so what?  We lost hundreds and made fun of a few prisoners.   Sure, it was wrong, sure, it dramatically hurts our cause, but until captured we were trying to kill these same prisoners.  Now we're  supposed to wring our hands because a few were humiliated?    Our compassion is tempered with the vivid memories of our own people killed, mutilated and  burnt amongst a joyous crowd of celebrating Fallujans.   If you want an apology from this American, you're going to have a long wait.  You have a better chance of finding those 72 virgins.

      So here are the disgusting details of my surgery as best as I remember them. If you are weak of stomach you'll want to  STOP READING NOW .   I will have four cuts.  A two inch or so one below my knee and next to my shin bone. There will be two, one inch cuts just below and on each side ofmy knee cap. The fourth will look more like a puncture wound and it will be above my knee.  They will place a metal screw into my shin bone and attach the cadaver tendon there. Then they will attach the other end of the tendon to a long needle which they will thread from below my knee, under my kneecap, and out the top opening above my knee.  They will attach the tendon with another metal screw in my femur. They will then use the openings on the sides of my tendons to thread the tendon into place laterally.   SAFE TO READ NOW   So that's the whole gory thing.  I love how I get two whole weeks to sit and stew on this now. I figure I will be wound up prety tight the two days before my surgery.  The whole thing is creeping me out.

Complete tear of the ACL  - Next appointment is Wed., July 21 for pre-op visit  - Surgery is scheduled for Friday, July 23, at 1:30pm  Surgery will last two hours and then I will spend a couple hours in recovery.  No hospital stay.  I will be in and out of the surgical center same day.  I will be home by 6:00 or 7:00pm and I won't want to talk. If you call, you will get to talk to Mark or my Mom.  Send presents  :o)  - I expect to be back at work by Monday, July 26  - My post op appointment is Friday, August 6  - I will probably need my crutches for at least another two weeks after surgery.  - I will be doing ass loads of physical therapy.  - I will probably be able to ride within a week of surgery.  HOORAY!!!!  - I am nervous and a little scared.  Send presents.  I will post the details of the surgery later. It is pretty cool.  I will have some screws drilled into my bones and a cadaver tendon. I will put a warning note in front of it so if it makes you wanna yak you won't read it.

      I have only one thing to say.  CARS SUCK!!!  This is my second day confined to the cage.  Sitting in my climate controlled cage on the freeway with all the other losers who can't or don't ride.  Now I know how wild animals feel when they are caged up.  I find myself wondering what I did in a previous life to deserve such punishment.  Yesterday my usual 30 minute ride home turned into an hour and 15 minute drive.  Yes folks, the cage wastes an extra 45 minutes of my life that I will never get back.  That's just in the evening.  Slap another 45 minutes on top of that for mornings.  On the way home four bikes passed me and I almost started crying.  Then an RV with a trailer loaded with bikes passed me on its way to Laguna Seca and I did start to cry.  I have missed World Superbike at Laguna Seca in six years!!  This weekend I will be stuck watching the world's best from my couch.  No exciting action in the corkscrew, no hearing the screams of the crowd when Haga does something wild, no nothing.  This whole injury things blows.  I am unable to find an upside to any of this.  Tomorrow morning at 9:30am I will be meeting with my doc.  Will know more then.  I have been keeping a notepad near me at all times to write down questions I have for him.  It is starting to look like a small novel.

      So the solution we came up with for riding may have been one that worked, but it is not a good working solution.  Back to the drawing board.  Going to hvae to drive the truck for a week or so until we get parts and get it sorted out. BLECH!!!  Had my MRI today.  Boy is that a freaky machine!  Lady was nice though.  She only put me in up to my chest. Good thing too, I damn near started hyperventilating just looking at it.  Just so everyone knows, I actually stayed pefectly still for 45 minutes.  Amazing how still you can be when if you need to.  I did not want to have to redo any of the pictures.  I did get stuck redoing one.  My stinking knee started twitching like mad and screwed it all up. I was just laying there begging my knee to stop.  It finally did, but too late to avoid having to redo the picture.  Not bad for me though.  I usually can't sit still for 30 seconds.  Friday morning I will be seeing my surgeon to discuss the MRI.  We will probably schedule my surgery at that time. You guys will know as soon as I do.  I am not in much pain but I am very tired.  Catch me in the morning and I am good to go.  By lunch time I am wore out.  It takes a lot more effort to do anything now.  probably doesn't help that I am not eating as much either.  it is too much work to get anything to eat.  That's it for today. I will keep things up to date here so y'all know what's going on.  Oh, and feel free to send me presents.  :o)

      So here is the update of the year.  Saturday morning I went to test for my blue belt.  When my turn to test came I was really excited and pumped.  Ready to really show how hard I had studied and practiced.  I was gonna look friggin' awesome.  I started out strong and was looking pretty good.  Then it happened.  I tried a spinning back kick and I screwed up BIG TIME.  I made the biggest mistake you could make.  I was focusing on the kick itself so it would look perfect and did not give my foot positions enough attention.  I planted my left foot.  When I spun, everything above my left knee spun, everything below it did not.  I spun right into the floor and screamed like a little girl. It was the most instantaneous and unbelievable pain I have ever felt.  Mostly I was  just damn scared.  When it happened there was a VERY loud pop.  Several people heard it.  Then it felt like something was tried to shoot out the side of my knee.  I a panicked a little. After about a minute or two I got the pain was gone and I got a grip on myself.  My first thought was "I don't want to drive a car". Then all I could really feel was disappointed.  I was really looking forward to showing Sifu and Sihing how well they had taught me.  I had studied and praticed so hard. I was also feeling bad about scaring everyone.  I was picked up off the floor and discovered that even the slightest weight on my left leg and my knee would buckle.  I can't walk.  I can hop on one foot though!  Hopped off the floor, got myself together, and hopped to my bike.  It took a bit of effort to get on the bike, but once there I was fine.  Rode the bike home, changed clothes, then Mark took me to the ER in the truck.  Spent 30 or 40 minutes in the ER waiting room, then another hour in an ER bed until a doc came to see me. Well, not a doc.  I was treated by a physicians assistant.  An abrupt, condescending, PA who really annoyed me.  She really did not listen to a thing I said.  The PA left, and 20 minutes later I met the ortho.  I got a good feeling from him and have decided to let him handle my treatment.  They consensus from the docs is that I tore my ACL (anterior cruciate ligament).  Just so you know this is not horrible, but it is bad.  Some websites for info:  http://www.sportsinjurybulletin.com/archive/0281a-acl-knee-injury.htm  http://www.aclsolutions.com/  I have to call the doc's office on Tuesday to get my MRI scheduled.  This will confirm the tear and see if it is complete.  It will also determine if anything else in my knee is damaged.    I am pretty much looking at surgery.  It will be arthroscopic surgery so I won't have any big scars.  They will take a dead guys donated ACL and replace mine.  Kinda cool.  In the mean time Mark has rigged up a way for me to carry my crutches and such on my bike.  I did the first test of the system this morning.  I made it to work on my motorcycle all by myself!  Thank goodness, riding is like breathing to me.  I would lose my mind if I couldn't ride.  Dealing with my leg being stuck straight out and these damn crutches has not gone to well though.  Seems like every five minutes I am presented with yet something else I can't do.  The simplest things are now a huge production. Just getting up and going down the hall takes a great effort.  Forget negotiating the stairs in and out of garage.  On top of this there is a lot of muscle pain associated with learning the cructhes.  My upper body hurts more than my knee.  You would be amazed at how many muscles you use for crutches.  The arms aren't even half of it.  When this is over I am gonna have rock hard abs and serious right cross punch.  This all has led to a great deal of frustration.  Of course with me, frustration leads to cranky, bitchy, angry, demanding, and all around hell to be with. I will owe Mark a LOT of serious pampering when I get better.

       Five days left until surgery day.     &nbsp;   Just because the earth has a sense of humor a heat wave is supposed to be here just in time for my surgery.&nbsp; Nothing like being miserable a  nd hot as hell.&nbsp; So far this thing still sucks and I haven't found an upside.     &nbsp;   I am getting more and more nervous as it gets closer.&nbsp; My biggest fear is post surgical pain.&nbsp; I am going to discuss this with the doc at my pre-op visit Monday morning.&nbsp; I want to make sure I have a way to get a hold of him over the weekend in case I need something stronger for pain then this crappy vicodin.&nbsp; Vicodin just doesn't work all that well anymore.&nbsp; I think I have had it prescribed a few to many times in my life.     &nbsp;   Mom is coming up on Wednesday.&nbsp; I know there is a part of her that is going to enjoy taking care of her&nbsp;little girl.&nbsp; It took a while but I grew up and finally reached a point where I needed my Mom, but I didn't need her help anymore. I am sure that is bitter sweet for Moms. Proud because they raised a kid to be self sufficient, but crappy because their little ones don't need them to take care of them anymore.&nbsp;   It wasn't until I moved 250 miles away that I realized I was a momma's girl.&nbsp;   I am looking forward to Mom coming. I miss her cooking.     &nbsp;   Sometimes I hobble out to the living room to sit with Mark for a while.&nbsp; I get a little lonely by myself.&nbsp; Poor guy has got to be tired of taking care of me by now. I know I would be tired of it.&nbsp; I can be cranky.

      WooHoo!!  I am going to have a real pint glass from a real Irish pub.  This just in from my good friend Charles' blog.  He is currently in ireland somewhere having a damn good time.  "I swiped a pint glass for my pal Julia, who wants gifts, but only if they are stolen. YAY!"  More good stuff to add to my collection of stolen things from around the world.  Last night sucked big time.  First time since I was injured that it actually hurt.  Kept waking up and was very unhappy and cranky. First time I took the drugs for pain and not for fun.  I can't wait for my surgery to be over. Only eight days left.  I just want to be done with this.  I am really tired of it and have had enough.

      Summer heat is the worst time to have an injury that requires you to wear what amounts to a beer cozy on your leg.  I am more annoyed and uncomfortable from the heat than I am from the pain of my injury.  I have been doing pretty well.  Haven't taken anything for pain in several days now. I am really not in pain. I am just VERY uncomfortable and miserable. Knee mostly has this funky, kinda numb,kinda not there feeling.  Watched the races at Laguna on TV.  Boy did that suck.  There was some awesome racing this year. It would have been another great year in the cork screw.  Next year I am going to corner work. I will make a vacation out of it. Camp out the whole weekend at the track and have a track side view of the races.  I am trying hard not to be a bitch. Most of the time I do OK.  Mark is a saint.  A very patient saint.

      The word of the day is PAIN.&nbsp; It didn't hurt this much when I injured it.&nbsp; I am in quite a bit of pain.&nbsp; Perfectly tolerable for the first couple of hours.&nbsp; After that it becomes intolerable.&nbsp; Vicodin is worthless.&nbsp; It is not even making me drowsy.  Chatting with someone seems to help though.&nbsp; The distraction eases the pain some.

      It is now 24 hours and 43 minutes until they make the first cut.  My tummy is in knots.&nbsp; I am cranky.&nbsp; I don't think I will have any trouble with the not allowed to eat after 10pm thing.&nbsp; I just think about food and it makes me want to barf.  Mom arrived last night.&nbsp; She brought all my favorite snacks and cooked dinner.&nbsp; So nice not to eat a microwaved tv dinner.  My dear friend Charles is turning 40 on Sunday.&nbsp; I am going to try my very best to go to his party.&nbsp; Even if it is just for a little while.

      Three and a half days until surgery. &nbsp; I had my pre-op doc visit today.&nbsp; All is well, surgery will happen on schedule. &nbsp; Physically I am doing well. &nbsp;Mentally, I am really done with this shit.&nbsp; I have had it.&nbsp; I haven't ridden&nbsp; in two weeks.&nbsp; Driving the truck sucks.&nbsp; Being in a car is like being in a concrete room with no windows, &nbsp;no doors, no light, no way out, and no connection to the machine or the outside world.&nbsp; Nothing exists outside your cold, dark, concrete enclosure.&nbsp;  &nbsp; When you ride you see and feel everything.&nbsp; You are connected to your machine and the world around you.&nbsp; Instead of merely being along for the ride you control the ride. &nbsp; This all just sucks and I am done with it.&nbsp; Got so mad today that I tried to get up and walk.&nbsp; Nothing to slam reality inyour face like a good face plant in front of witnesses. &nbsp;

      It is 3:30am and I am awake.&nbsp; I guess I am officially nervous about my surgery.&nbsp; I decided to get up and play on the computer.&nbsp; After laying awake with my brain running 100 miles an hour for 3 friggin' hours I decided to give up.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Send presents.&nbsp; :o) &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I have awesome health insurance.  Total costs billed so far:  $21,847  Total out of pocket:  $128  Not everything has been billed yet but this whole injury is probably not going to cost me more than $200.  Finally, after years of paying into various health insurance policies I get my money's worth.

      New complaint.   I have been stuck on my back so much that it is killing me now.  Worse yet, it is killing any chance of being comfortable for even a few blissful minutes.

      Everything is ordered and on schedule for Mark's birthday party this Sunday.  I am looking forward to seeing people.  I have been trapped in the house to long and it is driving me stir crazy.  Can you say "cabin fever"?  Yes, I thought you could.  Had a creepy moment yesterday.  I was laying around, like I do anything else anymore, and my knee turned into a little heater.  You could feel the heat coming off of it.  This creeped me out a little because it is a sign of infection.  Worst case kind of thing they plant me in the hospital for two or three days and main line antibiotics.  Anyway, I called the doc and they had me come in.  On my way over I stopped for x-rays that I brought with me to the docs.  Overall he is happy with the knee. Flexibility is good and the incision is healing nicely.  He prescribed me a huge dose of antibiotics, 500mg, that I must take four times a day for two weeks.  They are some impressive horse pills.  Thank goodness they are capsules or they would be hell to swallow.  I am going to scan and post up the x-rays after my next doc visit.  They are the neatest thing.  It is quite bizarre to stare at these x-rays, see the screws and the graft, and know that all that stuff is in me!  Pain wise yesterday was good.  I did not take any pain killers at all.  Not bad considering where I was just a few days ago.  Last night I had a bad moment.  I hadn't realized how much this has come to annoy me emotionally.  I was getting all wrapped, braced, and plugged into the ice machine for the night and I lost it.  The fact that I just couldn't get up and go to the bathrooom, or fill my water bottle, or carry my own dinner, or any damn thing had reached a frustration high.  The sheer effort involved in preparing to sleep became the straw that broke the camels back.  Out of the blue I start bawling like a little girl.  It totally snuck up on me and I was not prepared for it.  Poor Mark, he is tired and has only been back from Chicago a few hours.  Now he is stuck in a position where there is nothing he can do, nothing he can say, and nothing he does do or say is going to be the right thing.  That poor man was damned no matter what.  He took it like a champ though.  I am very lucky to have him.  Managed six hours straight of sleep though.  I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing more glorious than being unconcious for multiple consecutive hours.  Mom went home today.  Physically and with Mark home I am ready for her to go. But I really was not ready for her to go.  It was wonderful having her here taking care of me.  She really took care of Mark too.  It made everything so much easier having her here.  I got a good Mom.  Today has been a so so day.  Periodically my knee, or shin, or thigh will start to throb like hell.  It does that for about two to five minutes and is extremely painful.  At one point today it started a constant and growing ache and I had to break down and take some pain killers.  I am here to tell you kids, healing sucks.  After Mom left I took my first unattended shower :o).  I decided I stunk and couldn't stand it anymore.  Since my injury I have not taken a shower without someone home just in case I fall or something.  It is a bit annoying to know people are checking on you when you are doing something so basic and normal.  It feels kind of like being imprisoned in a way.  I was just going to do it.  Then the visions of Mark calling, me not answering, then Mark calling me neighbor, then finding myself naked with my neighbor and her two kids looking at me in the shower started dancing in my head.  So I called Mark and told him I was taking a shower and there was nothing he could do to stop me.  He laughed, asked me to be careful, and told me to call him when I was done.  I am looking forward to Monday.  It will be sooooooooo wonderful to go back to work.  It will make me feel human again.  I will feel less helpless and less of a burden.  I never thought sitting in cubicle would sound like heaven to me, but it does.  I am also a little scared of Monday.  It will be the first day of rehab.  If you know what they do to you for this please let me know.  It would be less creepy if I knew what to expect.

      Today was the best day I have had since surgery.&nbsp; I even got dressed today.&nbsp; Went crutching around the neighborhood and sat out in the yard.  Then I drove the truck to pick up dinner.&nbsp; I bought Mom and I cheese steaks and then we stopped by my kickboxing school.&nbsp; Introduced Mom to Sifu David and Sihing Josh.&nbsp; Visited for a&nbsp; few minutes and came home to eat cheese steaks.&nbsp; I got a get well card signed by the whole school.&nbsp; Every day I am reminded that I am surrounded by great people.  I still am not showing much interest in food.&nbsp; Tonight I sure got interested though.&nbsp; I ate a whole 15 inch cheese steak sandwich and a small order of fries.  I may have gone hopping around to much today.&nbsp; My knee is a bit throbby and sore and I am wore out.&nbsp; I am hoping that it translates into 8 solid hours of sleep in a row.

      Woohoo!!&nbsp; Yee Haw!!!&nbsp; And all that.&nbsp; I finally got decent sleep.&nbsp; I slept for&nbsp;5 1/2 whole hours straight.&nbsp; I noticed in the morning I wake up when the ice machine hits 60 to 65 degree's.&nbsp; My leg tends to be happiest at 45 to 50 degree's.  I have started planning a little get together for Mark's birthday this weekend.&nbsp; It looks like his birthday presents&nbsp;might arrive in time.  I have the coolest neighbors.&nbsp; My house is full of flowers and house plants, get well cards and balloons.&nbsp; When I first got hurt several of them made dinners forMark and I.  Well, I am off to shower.&nbsp; Mom says the weather is awesome so I am going to try and go bop around outside for a bit.&nbsp; Practice walking and stuff in the fresh air.

      Mark is in the air on his way to Chicago right now.&nbsp; I really do not like him away when I am healthy.&nbsp; I hate it when I am hurt.  I am gonna try and do some moving about today.&nbsp; Unplug from the ice machine they have circulating ice water around my knee.&nbsp; It is a neat device which has really kept the swelling down.&nbsp; I don't like to be unplugged from it for more than a couple of hours.  I have a bigger problem right now.&nbsp; Mark's birthday is Monday.&nbsp; I have not been able to get him anything or plan anything. He is such a great guy and he has been so good through all of this. I have to come up with something... FAST.

      I love the internet.&nbsp; Even better, I love instant message applications.&nbsp; Since my injury, and especially since my surgery, I have been kept company via instant message by a gentleman named Steven.&nbsp; He lets me whine and keeps my spirits up.&nbsp; He has no idea what a valuable support he has been to me.&nbsp; Even when I am too tired to chat I like his many daily messages checking on me.  I have never met this person and know very little about him.&nbsp; We have had brief occassional instant message chats for a couple of months now.&nbsp; We are essentially strangers.&nbsp; I would like to think we are friends now. One day I hope to have him over for BBQ and thank him for his friendship during this time.  Thanks Steven!

      Woohoo!!&nbsp; I&nbsp; just took my first&nbsp;shower since surgery!!&nbsp; I don't stink anymore.&nbsp; I haven't felt this good in days.&nbsp;   Did a few leg lifts and some knee bends.&nbsp; Then I did a little assisted walking up and down the hall way.&nbsp; I can't put full weight on it and I have to take small steps but it sure was nice.  More importantly, I am clean!!&nbsp; I can't remember the last time a shower felt this good.  I won't make it to work tomorrow.&nbsp; I am going to see how I do each day though.&nbsp; Maybe I can make it Wednesday.  Mark has to leave tomorrow afternoon for Chicago.&nbsp; He will be back Thursday.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;not happy about it but there is nothing I can do about it.&nbsp; He isn't thrilled about it either.&nbsp; It is a business trip he can't get out of.&nbsp; My Mom is gonna stay with me until he gets home.

      I found a wayto blow time.&nbsp;    urlLink http://www.netflix.com   I figure this should keep me busy for a while.&nbsp; Get to watch all the movies I have been to lazy to go rent.&nbsp; We always turn them in late anyway.&nbsp; This way there are no late fee's.  Talked to doc this afternoon.&nbsp; He says take all the pain killers I need.&nbsp; He also said to keep trying to bend it and stand on it.&nbsp; Says as soon as I can bend the knee 90 degrees to stop wearing the immobilizer.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I have a check up on Friday and should be able to start rehab next week.&nbsp; I already have a couple of exercises I have started.&nbsp; It hurts but that is to be expected.&nbsp; Just have to keep trying.  Pain is still the word of the day but I am feeling better about it.&nbsp; My goal is to get back towork this week. I still think I can make it.

      Today's weather forcast is for pain. Unending pain.  I also have the greatest man in the world.&nbsp; He went out for a bit yesterday and came home with a DVD player for the bedroom and some DVD's.&nbsp; He has a horrid cold and feels like shit and he still is taking care of me.  I don't know what I would do if my Mom hadn't come up to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the world's best Mom.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am just glad she is here.&nbsp; Even if she did not help at all, her presence is comforting.

      Yesterday was pure hell.&nbsp; The pain kept growing and growing.&nbsp; Drugs were worthless. At 7:oopm I had finally had enough and had Mark take me to the ER.&nbsp;   The doc was a complete ass but my nurse was wonderful.&nbsp; They shot me full of dilaudid and fentanyl and sent me home with a script for Lorcet.&nbsp; I still didn't sleep through the night.&nbsp; Woke up every one to two hours.&nbsp; It was nice to sleep while it lasted though. No pain when I am asleep.  I am going to miss Charles birthday party today :o(  Happy 40th Birthday Charles!!  &nbsp;

      I have made yet another leap in my recovery.  Today I no longer wear a brace.  I am on one crutch instead of two.  I was able to pedal all the way around on the stationary bike both forward and backward.  Before all I could do was rock back and forth.

      HUGE progress has been made!!!  Today I put my foot on the peg and successfully shifted gears.  I was also able to get my bike off of the kick stand and balance it.  I can almost put it back on the kick stand but not quite.  I think I might be able to ride this weekend!!!!!   :o)  I am also putting weight on the leg now and working on walking. The leg is still too weak to walk without my crutches though.   Soon I will be walking though.  Very, very, soon.

      Friday night I learned a couple of valuable lessons.   1) Just because you can do something, does not mean you should do it.  2) Just because a little is a good thing, it does not mean a lot is better.  I was at Charles celebration of being healthy and cancer free.  It was nice to get out and see people.  Anyway, so I am sitting there. It is so neat to sit normal with no brace.  All of the sudden the muscle on the outside of my thigh informs me I have been over using it by having a big 'ol spasm.  My leg jumped a good 8 inches off the chair, knee bent waaaay to fast.  They had to peel me off the ceiling.  1) Just because you walk with one crutch does not mean you should do it every chance you get.  2) Just because you can walk a little, and a little is a good thing, does not mean doing it as much as possible is a good thing.  I woke up Saturday morning with a double dose of misery.  Calf and thigh muscles stiff, sore, spasms, and suffering for Fridays over doing it.  To add to the funI got one of my throwing up, intolerable pain, vey dizzy migraines.  So I got to spend my weekend in miserable pain.  Sunday I felt like someone had pounded me and spent most of the day asleep recovering from the migraine.  Physical therapy is going well. Every time I go in they add more work and it is harder.  Today he even made me cry.  It is a bit annoying sometimes.  Everyone else in there are getting wonderful heat treatments, massages, and stuff. I am working my ass off and breaking a sweat.  When do I get the massages?  Every day at lunch I do my exercises.  Every day I come home and do them again.  They are not easy. It is hard work.  This is not going to be over with fast enough as far as I am concerned.
