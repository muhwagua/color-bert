       greetings. today i got my hair cut...i got long bangs.yes, i am livin on the edge- i am riskay. i went to toronto with the fam. and josh. i must say toronto is pretty scary when soccer games are being played in the same area that u have to walk in. this one 'soccer hooligan' checked out my whole family - including josh...and even my father. we went to joe badalis for dinner where apparently every staff member is somehow related to this Joe. hmmm...i was quite suspecious when its an italian resturant and there were waiters/waitresses working of many different races. then we walked to second city (a show where they perform comedy sketches)  . one man working there offered me a margarita  (yes please!)  but instead i had 'a sip' of my sisters drinks  A.K.A.   half of their drinks.  during intermission i looked behind my and saw two people making out. it was extremely disguesting, although the guy was kinda good looking. then i looked at the table next to the couple and saw a guy who looked very familiar. it was kalen porter from canadian idol. how did i know? becuz canadian idol is too cool for school. he was REALLY nice to look at. he is quite pretty in person actually. anyways we walked outside and some greasy portugal fan kept staring at me. freaky. anyways im out.  salutations,    hail  PS.    liquid bandaids rock my world!

       well well well.... i watched down with love. it was sooo good, confusing, yet good (but hey, everythings confusing to me) . this morning i went to williams coffee pub (hehe i love that word-pub)  . later i went to cambridge with my mother and father.i must say, walmart is a VERY cool store. but i was quite upset when they wouldnt buy me a mary-kate and ashley poster...but i was even upseter (if thats a word)  when they wouldnt buy me a hilary duff poster  (shes my idol)  . hmmmm, righttt. anyways... i went to megans and my favourite person in the whole wide world was there - no, not matt - fred.  matthew james george and kevin michael Da Costa were also there (kevin buddy, u gotta slow down on all that diet coke) . we watched the soccer games as matt tried to explain the euro cup to me. no luck there. matthew left, in a huff  (hahah i always wanted to say that...another funny word - huff)  and we chased after him, running down the street with no shoes on. then i came home and now i am here. im getting my hair done tomorrow and then going to see second city tomorrow night in toronto.  muchos loovin, hayley   *the future of safe sex is in our hands...sex can wait-masterbate*

       just got home from megans.  this morning i babysat. ughh waking up at 8 o'clock in the summer SUCKS! oh well...  keegan and riley r too cool for school and wouldnt come to my house becuz they decided to go to camerons, the same kid who threatened to kill me and marcus. whats a matter with kids today? me, my dad, my mom, vanessa, and emily went to kitchener and saw harry potter 3, becuz we are cool. i was sooo confused! but it was quite rewarding to see emily jump when the gurl touched his arm.  My Personal Opinion:   hermoine and harry and ron have a little loove triangle going on. oh why oh why does she have to be such a little witch-pimpette?  peter pan went up my skirt. yes, he is a perv. never trust men in leaves. we went back to my house, and how does emily repay me for including her in such a fun family bonding afternoon? she drops my toonie behind my fridge! then we went to megans and watched movies and stuff. it was a hoppin' partay; me, kayla (my loover, meyer) ,emily, megan, matt, kevin, and harriote the spy.  ''if i was a guy and i had a dream about you and i just woke up, i would have morning wood" yes, a pretty strange bunch we are.  well matt rode his bike home, and im pretty sure he got raped. but thats the price he pays for breaking tradition.   ciao bellas and bellos,  &nbsp;h

        ahhh i did like basically nothing today.  after dinner me, vanessa, and her friend aly went and saw mean girls (for the third time)  at 3 star. surprisingly the theatre was&nbsp;packed. &nbsp;after the movie i listened to the plane drama they had on the flight home from italy. the snotty little troubled rich kids  (or as they called them, the oc kids)  made out for 10 hours right beside them. when i got home i talked to nick trecapelli on the phone for 3 hours.  Its Offical:   we ARE the biggest losers in the universe.  i am still waiting for his apology for not coming to my house anymore. i guess he is just too cool for my house  (or as he called it the iacocca mental institute because i am apparently crazy).&nbsp; pschh wat a testical head.  &nbsp; well i have to babysit tomorrow morning so im going to go to sleep.   .xox.ciao.xox.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h.a.y.l.e.y.   PS. kevin im really sorry and i loove you:(

       today i was at megans. i went at like 2 and we waited for matt to come.&nbsp;with her&nbsp;HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU card we changed it&nbsp;so it said HA U BITCH YAY and taped it to the window (arent we creative) . matthew must be colour blind becuz he did not&nbsp;see it even though it was purple and other&nbsp;bright colours (ughh all that hard work for nothing) . then&nbsp;we walked to zerhs to get the film delievered. kevins brother, david was working.  ''soo u two are just fooling-around buddies?''    (wow that was akward)   i saw aly at the store  (tylers future wife..score!)&nbsp; also.  &nbsp; we walked back to megans becuz we didnt have enough money to buy confessions of a teenage drama queen. when we got back to her house , her mom drove us back to the grocery store so we could buy it. we went home (my home for the day: megans)  and watched the movie and had hotdogs for dinner. matthew james came back after and we watched the movie, again  (hahah we looove making him watch gurlie movies with us)  . for the rest of the night we watched movies, talked on msn, harassed matt, ate popsicles (i had 3.5, to be exact) ,tried to explain what period smells like to matt, you know the usual. we went to kevins and i finally got my advil (thank goodness..kevin is my hero)  and went back to megans. the boys went for a swim and then we went back into the basement. like whats up with kids today,&nbsp;all they&nbsp;ever do is&nbsp;kissy kissy? i was&nbsp;on the&nbsp;computer and they came and stood beside&nbsp;me and i started to say something and i looked at them and&nbsp;they were&nbsp;kissing!&nbsp;my goodness matthew, keep it in ur pants son. but i love&nbsp;them both very&nbsp;much. we are still one big happy family  (with our new addition: fred the fishy) .   &nbsp;&nbsp;yesss it was a fun day!   much love -hayley-  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xox

       well folks, today i went to toronto. saw my cuzins new house, its HUGE (lucky duckys) ! it was sooo nice! then i went to the airport to pick up my sister. i was in the washroom washing my hands when i saw those pad boxes thingys but it was different. there were all these different things to chose from. i was torn between getting a tampon, breath freshener, latex condom, or tatoo. like common, it was only a loonie (talk about a bargain) . the real sticky situation was whether to get the condom or tatoo...if only i had a toonie...but in the end i got nadda. my sister is finally home!!! the local italian boys in the pics  (sooo nice to look at ). &nbsp;i missed her lots and glad shes home.  good night...

       tonight was so much fun.  jessica, megan  (yay shes finally back)  , erika, matt and kevin came over for a movie night.  first we watched matthew and kevin play PS2  (ughh boys)  and then we watched along came polly.  For The Record:   me and kevin fought, i totally whooped his ass.&nbsp;  after that movie was done we watched the bestest movie in the whole entire world, Centre Stage  (that movie makes me wanna do point) . after being soaked by jess and kevin i went and changed, as jessica played with the tide  (or as we called it,toxic tide)  . there must have been something in that tide (Mountain Spring, to be exact)  because we went crazy. the movie had a big inpact on me and jess becuz we started dancing, and tried to copy the moves the PROFESSIONAL dancers did in the movie.  Keyword:   tried.  Yes, it was quite interesting. Kevin was our audience because erika left and matt and megan were actually watching the movie (pschh who actually watches the movie?! not us...)  . i'd say our lifts were deffinitely the best part although i always ended up laughing on the floor. we decided we r going to take ballet, but we will most likely get kicked out. oh well!   ur truely,  h to the izzo

        tonight was SO much fun!  kayla meyer came over to my house first..i jumped on her and we fell on the ground and i couldnt stop laughing. i think my mom got suspecious of the loud thud and giggling. we ran through peoples sprinklers on our way to keegans and marcus'.  WARNING:   Folks in the Greenwich-Thornhil-Wiltshire area, please do NOT leave your sprinklers unattended.  Yes, it was fun, apart from looking like i piddled my pants. Keegan and marcus werent home  (booo!) &nbsp;so we went back to her house and sent Logan a piece of his shoe that was on her lawn, after she stuck it in my mouth.  NOTE TO SELF:   Shoes dont taste good.  We went inside talked to Kevin and Matthew James George on the phone and went on the computer. I got to hear matt and kevin sing, which was very amusing. Kayla is one lucky cat, she got to see me dance on her table. I've been known to bust a few moves in my day. later we watched heartbreakers...and sang and talked to matt n kevin on the phone again...and through that all i kept laughing (FYI i was sober) .   lotz of loooove,  hailz

Hence:   tried.  it was good. ian, u know u liked it.  i finally made ian laugh. thats quite an accomplishment since hes always soo serious. he laughed for me- it was beautiful. hes a natural. plus, he should be a model. if he would spin and blow kisses for the cam.  ian..i heart you.  im out. love. hayley

      well i didnt end up going to the dance.HOWEVER, i had sooo much fun anyways.  jessica and madé came over. we were like the only people who didnt go to the dance. we watched goldmember  (or as i like to call it, goldfofo)  and talked and ate icecream sandwichs. i ate 4. meh, im just a fat rat.  we talked on msn and madé's friends thought we were high. i cant imagine us high, i bet we would depressed since we r so crazy when we arent. anyways, made waterfalls  (yawmean) .  then we watched THE BEST movie, other than havana nights, CENTRE STAGE. our dances get better and better each time. i nearly piddled when jessica did her dances. they were so hot! they were almost as good as matts dance last night.   {re-cap} matt dancing during havana nights, a lil more dirrty than in the movie. my mom at the stairs watching. all of us knowing she was there but not telling him. ''nice dance matt'' - my mom ohhh it was funny!   anyways back to tonight. we did some pretty sexay dancing.  'wiggle my butt' 'pelvic thrust' 'lip-sync-to-the-song-you-dont-know-the-words-to-and-head-bang' those are just a few of the many different moves that occured tonight.  i also got physically harassed tonight. madé and jessica banged my head on the keyboard, jessica smacked me everytime i said i look like a rat (hey, im only speaking the truth) , madésy pulled my underwear....  soo that was my amazingly fun night with missy madé and jess.  hope the dance was fun. tata for now.  ***hailz***

      i swear im about to fall asleep. i couldnt get to sleep last night and i had to wake up early to go babysitting. i had like 4 shitty hours of sleep.  when i babysat we watched peter pan, the cartoon one. then we watched aladdin.  Aladdin Looks Like:   mike renaud.  i hope i spelt his last name right. any who, aladdin is a sexy street rat. so either mike is hot, or he would just make a hot cartoon.meh.  me and jessica and nick tried to figure out which cartoon i look like.  ''well wats the sluttiest cartoon?" - nicki  ohh i dont like that tone mister.   why do i have to be soo useless.  Uno Problemo:   i want eggs but i have no clue how to make them.  its not my fault, im cookingly-challenged. its a well known fact.  however, i make a mean nutella-on-bread sandwich.  matthew james george, kevin,jippy, matt p come home today from kevies cottage. hooray. kidding! i love them all so much!  going to find a cook book. lurrrve,  hailz

      kayla made emily came over. we walked to kaylas house.we walked back down the street to mi casa and waited for logan tj and matt to come over. they showed up when kayla had my dogs leash on, it was quite funny seeing her try to get it off before they saw.  we walked down to the park becuz we had no where else to go. me and kayla crossed the creek in fear of getting raped. we walked around and did stupid stuff.  ''hold me made'' - me ''ok'' - and she wraps her arms around me and smacks me in the boobs ''i didnt mean sexually!'' - me grabbing my umm chest area becuz it hurt times gazillion  we went to kaylas and then went to imperial. why? i have no clue. when we got to the lights we walked back.  such a boring afternoon that could have been potentionally fun.  i walked home. went out to dinner with my mom and sister.  went to megans house. jessica and nicki t. were there. we watched grind and the teen choice awards.  ''give me the blanket!" - moi ''no!'' - nick grabbing the blanket ''NICK GET OUT OF MY FEFE!" - me screaming up the stairs so megans mom would hear " yaa nicki get that small thing out of hayley!" - megan hehe nick i ove u!   then we went outside in the rain. we played tag, well kind of, nick wasnt being fun and wouldnt chase us. we just ran around the streets screaming. ohh and we went streaking. that was my brillant idea. but dont get ur hopes up. our streaking only resulted of us taking our sweaters off (well i took NICKs sweater off..its hot..i want it) . then my mommy picked me up and i went home.    mike, im am very dissapointed that u broke our plans. i was really looking forward to today. but i guess i accept ur apology. on one condition: u come another day.  i totally aced ur quiz nic. some of the questions were pretty tricky though. 2 out of 10 is a good score.  much loove, peach out a town.  hayley Ps. i dont know what or where a town is.

       today i went to princess emilys. we went and saw cody to say happy birthday.      *HAPPY BIRTHDAY CODEZ*    then we hitch hiked back to her house. kayla smith came over. we went back to codys. we ran around his house and he chased us. we went up to his room and put on his baseball helmets. boy was it sexy! kayla and emily ran outside with his medals on and he chased them up the street,while i ran into his garage, attempting to steal some vodka thing. no luck. so we went into his basement and decided we felt like watching porn, because kayla said i was 'porny'. since theres apparently no porn on at 2 in the afternoon, we watched beach volleyball, which is our version of porn. good enough. then we watched 50 first dates. me and his brother, tyler, tried to download taking back sunday songs but it wouldnt work. booo!  walked back to emilys and basically talked on msn all night. oh wait, we also took several pics of us (and by several i mean a gazilllion) . for dinner we had two boxes of pizza. we each had like 4 or 5 pieces. we had a quite interesting conversation with her mom:  "so what do u girls look for in a guy?" - ems mom "..." -all three of us ''SEXYNESS!" - emily "well why do u date a guy?" - emz mom rolling her eyes at emily "..." - all of us "well who was ur last boyfriend hayley?" - mama "nick..." - moi "why did u like him?" - e's mother    (e..hahahah)  "he bought her a $100 and something necklace and she dumped him before he gave it to her" -emily like piddling "why dont u ask kayla, shes the one with the boyfriend" - em "oh who" - emilys mother "..logan.." - kayla "why r u dating him" - roz [ emilys mom ] "becuz hes nice and funny...."- kayla turning red "because hes hot!" - emily -all of us like peeing our pants- "oh ok then." - roz  me and emily 'sexed' for a bit, well matt said it was 'dry sex' cuz we had our clothes on. same thing.  when we were waiting for my mom to pick me up me and em were outside. it was like pitch black and there were these two guys walking a dog.  ''hey'' - emily ''whos this?'' - emily ''whos this?" - guy "hayley" - emily "how old r u" - guy "14" - emily "waht grade are u going into?'' - guy "..." - me and emily, u know, with our dis-ability to find out what grade u'd be in if u were a certain age "r u ap" - emily "ya" - guy as he starts to walk our way -meanwhile im like piddling myself telling emily not to get me raped- "do u know kayla then" - emily ''fine im not ap" - guy and he walks away "hayley says she loves u!!!" - emily thanks!!  loove , hailz

(i forget how the rest of the song goes) . so i guess ill have to wing it. here goes... i loove u dearly. have my babies. u r hot. the end. PS. please dont cheat on me wiht my cousin, thats gross.    i saw my soul  mate today, the drummer from maroon 5. im still not sure what his name is but thats ok, names r just letters (wow thats wise) . i was watching the ''she will be loved'' video or wahtever its called. its not fair, the lead singer makes out with not 1, but 2 girls in the video, and my lova gets nothing. if he needs a girl to play the opposite role of his kissy person..just give me a call, im ok with a little PDA (public display of affection) . plus, we plan  on getting married.  ..hayley..

       just got home from the concert. it was good, but nothing beats rooney. i swear my family has a sixth sense on the smell of abercrombie & fitch. when i was at emilys we sprayed some of her brothers cologne on (i couldnt resist)  . i came home and my moms like whos wearing a&amp;f?! then all during the concert my sisters would be like:   ''u smell like a hott boy'' ''never put that on again. i keep thinking theres a hot boy around but really its my little sister" bah. tricked u!  our seats were good. that was until a giant sat infront of me. it didnt even seemed like he wanted to be there. all he did was block my view of the stage. oh wait, he also stood up during my favourite song. honestly, does he serve a perpose.     im heartbroken. my lover, the drummer of maroon 5 wasnt there, he was 'sick' . sure, since hes soooo 'sick' he cant return my calls. ugh! i swear, hes the one. the love of my life. i want to mate with him. oh please have my babies. instead, they had some ugly drummer with a beard. drummer of maroon 5, please marry me (it must be legal in at least one state).   we played some fun games while we were there. like count the ugly shoes. ''ewww look at those shoes, they r soo ugly" - vanessa ''umm i have those in white instead of black" - me ''... oh" - v   another game i played was guess how many drinks that lady had. too many for her body to handle.  it was the funniest thing ever! these two ladies, getting jiggy with it, to  johnny m. everyone was staring at them becuz they were soo drunk and they were dancing thinking they were soo hot (meanwhile i was thinking, im glad those arent my mom) .  Men:   when your wives r that drunk, musell them for the sake of everyone around them, PLEASE!    well thats about all that happened at the concert. oh yes, john mayor, ur such a sweet talker.  love, hailzzzzzzzzzzzz

      woke up matt megan and jessica came over. we watched centre stage for the 3rd time. me and jess did our oh so famous dancing. we talked on msn, fooled with peoples minds. we told some sara girl our names were: uwanna fuck - megan ivanna spanku - me lets getiton - jessica  (it was the tide, i swear)  i have a boyfriend (finally)  , jessica. she is sexy, but back off, shes mine bitches. it was quite amusing watching matt chase megan around with the mistle toe, yet he still got nothing (unless u count his bonner) . we also watched legally blond2 and monsters inc. ahhh those r such good movies. as megan and matt ''bonded'' me and jessica made loud noises yet it still did not stop them. sooo we took pictures of them ''bonding'' (muahah me n jess r bad) .  wow i hope my parents werent listening becuz some of the stuff said would not have sounded to G rated:  ''wow hayley that hole is soo nice'' - jessica ''ya its huge!'' - matt it took me a while to realize they were talking about the hole in my sock.  ''its stuck in the back of my throat'' - matt ''ughh its soo big!'' - matt ''it tastes like banana'' - matt isnt that interesting since no one other than him has a penis?       no jessica i am not cheating on u. no megan, matt is not cheating on u.  (matt call me sometime!)  jokes! matt was quite mean, he even threatened to ''kick me in the fefe" . hes a nice lil fella isnt he? yes, well, thats about all we did during the 10 hours they were at my house. tempting isnt it?  much loove, hayley aka. ivanna spanku

       well fellas.. matthew james george, megan, and kevin michael Da Costa came over tonight. we watched centre stage again (i need to get new movies)  .  Funniest Moment of the Night:   kevin dancing around in megans sweater trying to copy the moves the ballerino in the movie did and he hit his hand on the vent.  that almost made me piddle. i am sorry kevin that i made ur nose bleed it was a total accident, i didnt even know i did it. i feel dizzy i think i sniffed the paper with the cologne on it too much, but it smells sooo good! sometimes kevin can even remember my name. hes known me for like ever and still he calls me megan! oh well, sometimes i get a little twisted in the  head(*cough* all the time *cough*) .  Other  Funny Moment of the Night:   when my dog ran into the door.    kayla i am quite upset u never called me back although i am aware u had soccer. dont worry we can always just spoon tomorrow night. and who knows, maybe if its hot we can run through other peoples sprinklers. yes, that will splendid.  peace loove n watever else goes with peace &amp; love, .h.a.y.l.e.y.j.a.n.e.

       i am FINALLY home from michigan  (even though i was only gone for 3 days)  ... im glad to know u all missed me! hmmm yes, i am sure u are all doing kart-wheels becuz u are so happy im home...right...  it was like the longest drive ever to get there. of course we brought portia, we couldnt leave our baby!  i was finally home  (home: abercrombie&fitch) .however, i was quite disappointed that there were like ZERO hot guys working there...thats why i go in the store! but i must compliment the store on smelling SO DAMN GOOD! mmm, if a guy wore that cologne, he would have my heart AND my nose. sooo, we bought the cologne. no, not for a boy, for us. to smell. no, we arent complete losers. if u smelt it u would understand.  Future Goal:   to make every living boy smell that yummy.    we also went to hollister where the male workers were unbelievably hot! i am dead serious, they were gorgeous. much hotter than the A&amp;F guys, and the A&amp;F guys are usually pretty damn sexy. the hollister people would like follow u around the store, not that im complaining or anything, those boys can follow me around ANYDAY! i found my dream bathing suit there. and went to try on the top and it was a tad bit small (we dont want a re-occurance of wat nick saw at megans party now do we?) . so i went to go get the other size and some gurl had like 15 bathing suits in her hand, including the one i wanted. so we went back the next day and it was NOT there. that stupid bitch ruined my holiday. thanks lady.  me and vanessa went swimming. we did our swing dancing in the pool. it was some fancy stuff.  one night at dinner our waiter, rodney, was the best. one cool cat, ill tell ya. he even convinced us to get dessert. glad that hes looking out for the health of our family when he served us the chocolate cake. but honestly, he was rele nice. i bet right now hes eating his cheese cake in the kitchen 0f the resturante. i will sure miss him. rodney- i salute you.  i also gained attractiveness while i was gone. i walked into the wall and hit some metal thing and now i have a swollen lip  (fat lips...ahhh it brings back the memories of when we were younger kayla)  .  well that was michigan. fun stuff. so glad to be home! i missed everyone. and yes teesh, i am ''pimpin it up'' in my new clothes indeed.  _____________________________________________________________________  mike dussin, i hope everything works out according to plan. we put alot of thought into how u are going to rape me. im not sure greg knows hes involved in this, but he will. remember thursday at about lunch time. my place. ohh goodie i am soo excited! just thinking of u guys in those sexy lingerie is sooo suducting. so make sured the date we picked is good with gregothy and we will be all set. k? yippie.   nicholas ken sampogna, you are currently on 'Hayley-Probation' which means i should recieve an email everyday. however, it seems as though you arent co-operating. i checked my inbox and i had .N.O. new emails from you, when i should have had 3, including the night when u promised u wouldnt forget. im expecting u to be less 'tardy' now or there will be serious consequences which include the silent treatment, dirty looks, spanking, ignorance, etc. thanks in advance, hayley iacocca mayor of calagry, usa   well thats all ive got. lots of loove, hailz
