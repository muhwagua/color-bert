      So, I was listening to KQRS this morning and they mentioned this web site for  urlLink mail order husbands . They were obviously getting a kick out of it, so naturally I had to go see what the fuss was all about.  I read the following descriptions and just about wet myself:  "I'm definitely a classic romantic. I like a candlelight dinner, some quiet background music, and a couple hits of ether. I prefer a woman that has insurance and a car would be great as I need to make the occassional trip to Mexico to pick up "souvenirs"."  Or the guy from Romania saying: "I am looking for someone who can hold my attention, keep up with me, and who knows how to dress a wound".  Now tell me that isn't funny.

      Today at work, while sitting between two VPs (whose suits are probably worth more than my paycheck) I did two things. One: I compiled a list. I wrote down words or phrases used repeatedly that I have never, ever used in a sentence or spoken out loud. "instigate" "paradigm shift" "manipulation of proximity" "logistics of personal diplomacy" "positive external trending" "low volume accumulation" and so on.    And two: I watched some of the top management in our company eat their doughnuts and complimentary pastries carefully, concluding that there are two types of people: Those that eat their pastries in a timely fashion like normal folks, and those that find it necessary to poke at them with their forks every 3.42 nanoseconds, while carrying on a staredown as if the doughnut is an enemy about to sprout legs and whip out an AK47, then proceeding to pick off pieces crumb by crumb, as if actually chewing the food would cause a global disaster and end mankind altogether.     It took everything I had not to scream,  "for god sakes,   EAT THE FUCKING DOUGHNUT   ! " , while cramming it maliciously into their face.      I mean, really, how hard is it?       It's sugary. It's sweet. It's edible. What's the problem??

      When I'm not working this weekend or trying to catch up on sleep, I'll be  urlLink here.     Yesiree, it's fair time in my neck of the woods. Though personally, I could easily skip all the rides and entertainment and go straight for the Demolition Derby.     If I had a junky old car, I'd totally enter to be a driver. I mean, I get to smash into other cars in front of a cheering crowd? In hopes of being the last remaining, in which I recieve a trophy and cold hard cash?     What's not to love?

      Picture it: it's a lovely summer evening, the sun is setting and a cool breeze is blowing gently through the window. You're in the kitchen, relaxingly cooking one of your favorite meals: Chicken Marsala. You think to yourself how lovely a glass of wine would be, and oh look, there's some Marsala sitting conveniently on your countertop. You grab a wine glass and pour yourself some, thinking to yourself,  "Hey. It can't possibly be that bad."      Uh, yeah. It can.     For those of you that are too smart, sophisticated and cultured to try such a thing, let me explain what Marsala tastes like. Not to sound disgusting here, but really, how else can I say it?     Ass juice. It tastes like ass juice.      Ass juice in a fancy little wine glass. How on earth a meal as delicious as Chicken Marsala can be made from something so vile is really beyond me.      (NOTE: that's not meant to imply I've actually tasted ass juice. I'm simply using my keen sense of imagination while trying to convey how really horrible it tastes. Work with me, people.)      So the next time you hear me saying I'm making Chicken Marsala, please, for my sake, stop by with a nice bottle of Merlot or a harmless Chardonnay.     And while you're at it, bring along some wit and a charm I can't resist.

      I was never really popular with the boys. Oh sure, I had my share of boyfriends, but I was never the most sought-after girl. Awhile after the situation with J, I became interested in a boy a few years younger than me. Now, when you're that young, a few years makes a huge difference. I was about to learn another important life lesson.     For the sake of anonymity, I'll call him Shawn. Shawn was, by most standards, cute and friendly, and very social. He was one of few people I knew that could strike up a conversation with anyone. He was always polite; he never failed to open doors for me, or offered to carry my bag, and he wouldn't even think of using harsh language with me. He was the first boy who ever treated me like that.     So naturally I was smitten.     Within months we started hanging out after school. There was an old brick building behind the town library that we would sneak into to talk and flirt. It was a small building nearly the size of a shack, painted seafoam-green and completely empty inside, with the exception of a few planks of wood we used for sitting on since the floor was covered with grime. It was in that small enclosure he first brushed my arm, causing goosebumps and a blush to rise on my skin. It was where I noticed how blue his eyes could be, and how curly his eyelashes were. When he smiled, his eyes smiled too. It was there we would share Doritos and apples picked from the nearby tree. His transportation was a bicycle the same shade of green as that building. I began to look for that color everywhere. I saw it in my sleep.     Soon we began "going out". It was the first and only relationship I was ever in that was purely emotional. Sexuality wasn't an issue, we never held hands or kissed. For the first time I was with a boy that didn't pressure me in any way.     Of course, maybe that's just because he was younger and had yet to reach the "maturity" of the boys my age. At any rate, I was sold.     But he wasn't.     It was crushing when he broke up with me. I didn't see it coming. I was blindsided.     And when I saw him the next day, it only confused me more.     "Whatcha doin' Jinster?" he asked, circling me on his bike, a smile on his face.     I was dumbfounded. Didn't he know I was crushed?     "Nuthin'"     "What's wrong? What happened?"     God. Did he have to ask?? I wondered if all boys were this clueless.     I didn't speak.     "Is it about yesterday?"     I turned and saw him, blue eyes crinkled with concern, worry in his voice, and I had to look away.     "Don't do this. You know it doesn't really change anything."     Huh? It changed everything! How could he not see that?     "Talk to me. C'mon."     "Why," I asked angrily, "don't you like me anymore?"     "But I do," he insisted.     "You dumped me!" I exclaimed, tears now forming in my eyes.      He looked away and was silent, a stricken look on his face.     "I'm just not ready."     "Not ready? For what?"     He sighed, "a relationship."     I didn't know what to say. It dawned on me I was the first girl he was ever involved with. The thought hadn't even crossed my mind.     Then, he melted my heart.     "You know I think you're beautiful, don't you?" he asked quietly, a blush spreading on his cheeks. His voice faded to a whisper, "and I don't just mean on the outside."     I stepped closer to him, studying his face. The air was thick and the sun was setting. His face was golden as he looked at the ground.     "No, I didn't know that," I said, my voice quiet. He looked at me then, our faces now inches away. I wanted to kiss him then, and he knew it. The look of conflict and fear on his face said it all.     I realized it wouldn't be fair to kiss him then, or to continue in a relationship he wasn't ready for, even though I had strong feelings for him. I owed him the same respect I should have been given when I was with J; he just wasn't ready, at least not now and not with me.     The last thing I remember about that day is watching him ride off into the dusk, his seafoam-green bicycle fading into the evening.     I never did tell him I loved him.      And now, if I were to make a painting of first love, it would be seafoam-green and would have curly eyelashes with blue eyes.

      By the time I was a freshman in high school, I became more and more interested in boys. After a well-known senior on the football and wrestling team showed an interest in me, I was on a mission. Most people would describe me as shy, so I don't know how I managed to approach a senior and ask him for his phone number, but I did it. And called him that very night. Before long he was giving me rides to school in the mornings, although we never declared ourselves as a couple. I was fine with him seeing other girls, because that meant I could flirt with other boys. No problems, eh? After all, I was much too young to be committed, and I was just beginning to date boys. But it wasn't long before I saw a different side to the popular senior, who I'll simply call J.     J was a large guy, tall and big enough to be declared heavyweight on the wrestling team. He was friendly and quick with a joke. He dressed preppy and was a part of the in-crowd that I never quite fit into. But being a freshman dating a senior gave me more respect than most of my peers, who were putting up with initiations and pranks, even though the school had rules against it. I'm not sure how my mother felt about my seeing him, and I can't recall if I was honest about his age or not. Probably not.     Long story short, I began going to his house after school, where we'd make out. It was a confusing time, I felt pressured to go further and further with him, and once I talked to him about it. He told me to trust him, and being so young and naïve, I did just that. I should have known better. I knew I didn't love him and he didn't love me. It was all too casual. It simply didn't feel right. But, stupidly, I did it anyway.     When I lost my virginity, my self-esteem hit an all time low. Every time I had sex with him after that, a part of me faded away. My innocence was gone.     We drove out to the lake one night because I was upset about an argument I had with my mother, and he said he'd make me feel better. It was when he kept trying to kiss me even though I told him to stop that I began to get scared. He said he was just trying to make me feel good. "You're just trying to make yourself feel good!" I countered, becoming angry with his attitude. He was silent.     I thought that would be it, I thought he understood I was in no mood for making out. But it wasn't.     He leaned over and tried to unbutton my shirt. I pushed his hand away and told him to take me home. I was getting pissed.     "Not 'till we're done," he said, looking at me sternly, a firm hand now over my breast. It was then the panic washed over me.      "I'm not in the mood, goddammit, now stop it! You're scaring me!" My voice was getting shaky.     "Don't you know this is all a slut like you is good for?" He moved closer to me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I'd never seen him like this. My hand went instinctively to the door handle, pulled on it, but the door was locked. I reached to unlock the door, but he grabbed my wrist, easily encircling it with his large hand.     "Stop it! You're hurting me!" I exclaimed, my fear coating every word.     "You're only hurting yourself," he growled, "stop fighting it."     And when he crawled over me I knew I was pinned. He had an easy 90-pound (or more) advantage over me. I closed my eyes, my fear paralyzing my body and my panic nearly suffocating me. All I allow myself to remember after that is feeling nauseous.     I never spoke of what happened for years. I kept my distance from J after that, and tried not to show my fear. It was then I began to associate fear with weakness.     I saw J again last year, while hubby and I, with a few co-workers, stopped at the bar for a few drinks. He made small talk and sounded cheerful, but he didn't look me in the eye.     I often wonder if he ever thinks of that night 9 years ago and if he has any remorse.

       Brian was the shy blonde boy that lived down the street from me. He was generally quiet, a good student, kind of a geek and not terribly good looking; he was balding by the time he was 16 and had a bad case of eczema. He'd already started his own business while still in high school, building and fixing computers, and by age 17 had timeshares in condo's in Florida. We were never very close, but we spent many evenings talking or working on school projects, spilling over books in the corner of his parents' small kitchen. Whenever his friends planned trips to the Science Museum, he would always invite me.      "So...do you think you'll want to go?" he'd ask, eyes hopeful.      "Um, I dunno. I think I might be busy that day" I'd reply, trying to be nice.      "Oh...Well, we're going to get dinner afterwards and I thought maybe we could go together. Of course, I'll pay so you don't have to worry about that."      "Ahh, I really wish I could..."      "Oh...Well maybe some other time."         I don't know why I never went out with him. In school, we would always pair up whenever we could for projects; we worked well together. We would eat and share lunch often. It was tradition for us to go trick-or-treating every Halloween. Each year, we would stop by the park after it got too late and he'd push me on the swing. We'd do that for hours, talking and sharing secrets well into the evening. Perhaps Brian misread my feelings for him; it was obvious to everyone including me that he was falling fast. I warned myself to tread lightly. This was dangerous ground.      As much as I wanted, I just couldn't like him that way in return. I noticed the way he looked at me when he thought I couldn't see, the way he would watch for me at school, the rose he gave me for Valentine's Day in the middle of Algebra class. The way he beamed when I hugged him for the first time. He was a sweetheart, but I wasn't feeling what he was feeling. The mere thought of kissing him was an unpleasant one; I simply wasn't attracted to him like that.      On graduation he wrote in my yearbook, "See you at the 5 year reunion! Wink, wink."      My reunion was last week, and I didn't go. But, for some reason, despite all my other former classmates, he's the only person I'm even remotely curious about.        I wonder if it's because I haven't had an admirer since him, or if I simply miss his friendship. Or both.

      I have two cousins that are absolutely beautiful. Effortlessly thin. Perfect hair. Tall. Tan. Gorgeous. Flawless skin. Magazine-worthy, made-for-bikini bodies. And not only are they blessed with excellent genes, but they have magnetic personalities. Popular. Always wanted. Loved. Worshipped, even.  And then there's me.  I've always felt like the ugly duckling in the family. Not that I'm grotesque or anything, but next to them I'm not exactly jaw-dropping. I'm 5'2". Average weight. Curvy. Hair that's been known to work against me even to my best efforts. The occasional pimple. My quick-to-sunburn-but-impossible-to-tan, easy-to-bruise, overly-sensitive skin. And my personality? Quiet. Shy. Easy-going. The word "wallflower" comes to mind.  My cousins were the girls who always had dates, the girls with the confident smiles, the girls that never ate lunch alone, the kind that got invited to every single party.  And who was I? I was the girl in the background. The studious one. The one you'd go to if you needed class notes. I was the one with the mysterious smile. The girl who read history books for fun. The girl that took Physics without needing the credit. The geek, without the standard geek appearance.  And now my recently divorced grandma is taking one of my "terribly stressed-out" gorgeous cousins to Vegas. Completely free of charge.  Really, I can see how a single, young grocery cashier can be so stressed out to warrant a free vacation then say, a married woman with a young toddler at home who works 6 days a week and has selflessly given up her privacy and part of her home to her father-in-law since he became jobless and homeless regardless of the fact he's driving her crazy, because, dammit, that's what family does.  It's times like these I have to remind myself that I'm also the girl who never forgets a birthday. I'm the girl who does the dishes after Thanksgiving dinner so the chefs in the family can have a break. I'm the girl who volunteers to sit at the kiddie-table, the one that plays with the kids more than their own parents do. I'm the one willing to give the cranky Alzheimer-ridden great-grandmother a hug and kiss, regardless of the fact she doesn't recognize any of us anymore.  I've always held on to the belief that you reap what you sow. That what comes around goes around.  And while my cousins get vacations and parties and popularity, I have a wonderful husband and baby girl waiting for me at the end of the day.  Sure, they may have the freedom to switch colleges and majors whenever they please or date a different guy every week, but they come home to an empty house each night and still rely on other people to pay their bills. And while their homes may be filled with hip furniture and stylish décor paid for by their trusty credit cards, mine is filled with comfort and most of all, warmth.  People will say it's because they are too sophisticated and smart to focus on just one thing, that those kind of people are too restless to settle. And that they are destined for greatness.  One thing I know is I'm not destined for greatness; I've already been blessed with that. And so have they, they just can't see it with all the clouds in their eyes.  And that may be the only difference between them and me that's worth recognizing.
