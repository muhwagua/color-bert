      This is my first time writing my deep thoughts down(not to mention publicising it) in Blogspot .  I am currently a student studying physiotherapy in a local polytechnic in Singapore. It was like a dream come true because I had always wanted to do this course since graduating from secondary school. However, I found out that the higher you expect something to be, the greater the impact of disappointment if it does not meet your expectations. But, this does not mean I regret studying this course.   Through this course, I saw with my own eyes humility and compassion. Unlike those medical dramas which portray the hero/heroine in tears-inducing scenarios, what I witnessed did not turn me into a cry-baby, BUT it touched the bottom of my heart and inspired me to continue this journey. Till now(almost 2 years since I entered the course) I am still in the course though thoughts of giving up are still surfacing in my mind. But whenever I recall those touching scenes during my attachment, I pick myself up and carry on.             So, moral of the story is,  the reality may be different from your dream but never forget what you started out to achieve .

      This is the fifth day since I started writing in Blogspot. The HTML coding proved to be a killer to an amateur like me cos I took HOURS just to understand a simple sentence! Seems like my belief that I am a fast learner is finally broken...Sob sob. There were times when I really felt like breaking the CPU to vent my frustration.  Browsing through computer books and talking to friends trained in IT brought me more confusion such as XML, CSS and JAVA. Add to that the incessant throbbing pain of my toothache,which no amount of painkillers seem to help, and you get the perfect concoction to drive anyone bonkers.  All these had resulted in little sleep during the night and had caused me to be unable to even walk properly in the morning cos I nearly bumped into a girl(quite nice-looking though) when I was walking back home in a daze. I am not trying to discourage anyone to attempt HTML but don't do it overboard. However, all these obstacles did not dampen my spirits but it had further fuelled my desire to make my site a PERFECT one. It had been years since I felt such pure adrenaline flow in my blood and I am not going to miss out on this experience, even at the expense of other things!

      I am not a person who likes to watch Taiwan drama serials, but after watching an episode of the much-acclaimed Westside Story, starring the famous male pop group 5566, it caught my immediate attention. Although the storyline may be crappy at times, there are some things in the drama which set my inquisitive mind to work.   A friend of mine once told me humans like to find someone to identify with, irregardless whether they are fictitious or not. I found the thinking of one of the male lead quite similar to mine. In the drama, he was very pessimistic about his life and doubts everyone. However, things took a turn when he met a girl he liked alot but did not accept him initially.  Such scenarios are quite commonplace in everyday life. Boy meets girl. Boy changes because of girl. Girl leaves boy. Boy changes back. However, what struck me was something the male lead said about  blaming everything to fate and shrugging off all responsibilities.   Since my JC encounters with relationships, I was very upset about my life and seemed to fall into a bottomless pit. It resulted into a vicious cycle as I pushed everything to the back of my head and left my life in a lurch. Things turned from bad to worse when I entered the army as the culture turned me into a more introverted person. Fortunately, I was brought out of the darkness by a campmate and he showed me the possibilities of happiness.  Things seemed to brighthen up alot for me as my perspective about life was changed drastically to a more positive one. But, I was still prone to relapses of semi-depression and skeptical about people and their intentions. I finally found the root of all my problems when I heard what the male lead said. All the while when I was trying to solve my problems, I was actually running away from them. But now, I have a different challenge:  To face my fears and not run away from them.    I will end this session of self therapy with a quote of mine.  Not every love story has an happy ending, but the start of a happy relationship definetely has love.

       "In this world, there are no achievements without sacrifices. To obtain something you desire, you have to pay with something of similar value. That is the alchemy principle of equal exchange."   Fullmetal Alchemist         The above quote was extracted from a popular anime in Japan called  Fullmetal Alchemist . In this thought-provoking storyline, an innocent pair of brothers attempted to use alchemy, a science widely acccepted in their world, to resurrect their dead mother. In the process, the body of the little brother was taken away but his elder brother sacrificed his entire right upper limb, after losing his right lower limb as the price, to exchange for the soul of his brother, who now resides in the casing of an armour. What they brought back was not their mother, but a half-dead distorted body with the face of their mother. After this experience which changed their lifes drastically, they seek to find a way to redeem their original body.  I learnt and understood more about life after much pondering about the main quote, which will show up during the opening theme of the anime in every episode. There are at least 2 lessons we can learn from this. I used to believe in what people call "luck". That one can simply sit back and wait for something , hopefully pleasant, to happen without doing anything. I will just attend some lectures during my JC period, forgoing all the tutorials for Mathes 'C' and expected to obtain good results. Your first reaction may be one of extreme repulsion and disgust. But before you dump this issue at the back of your brain, spend some time to think about it. When was the last time in your life that you said "Thanks!" and really meant it, or offered to help out a family errand without a single complaint? I believe most of us, myself included, are taking things around us for granted! There is a purpose for everything to exist. However, those things will fade and disappear if their purposes are not justified. Pardon my straight-forwardness, but that is the exact reason why the morals of Mankind has succumbed to almost the level of an animal, at the astonishing speed similar(perharps proportional) to the accelerating advances in technology!  The other lesson which we can learn is one of "equal exchange". Using an example from quantitative analysis of chemistry to demonstrate the balance of action and reaction, to titrate a certain amount of potassium permanganate, one requires to add the exact amount of sodium hydroxide. Too little and there will still be a tinge of purple inside. Too much and the solution will be too basic or alkaline. It is the same in the way we do things or behave. If you talk too much, people will think you are a chatterbox. If you talk too little, people will think you are an extremely shy person. Therefore, in life, one needs to be aware of the balance of the universe. To conclude my session of blabbering, I will leave you with a quote from the Mean, one of the doctrines of the Wise Master, Confucius.   "While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings have been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great root from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this Harmony is the universal path which they all should pursue."

      Went to a friend's 21st birthday today. Had loads of fun, especially the part where almost everyone was throwing the birthday cake at the birthday girl! Even her own mom was part of the team! Ended up I thought I was one of the worst victims cos my face was literally all white and brown from the cake. Found out from the party that I wasn't really a social creature cos I felt somewhat out of place during the party(maybe it was because I was the only Physiotherapy student there).  We ended playing Koala Bear(dun ask me why they call it that name). It's actually a game where out of a group of people, two people are chosen to be the koala bear "killers" and another person is assigned to be the angel, who will try to hint to the rest who are the culprits. It was a very interactive and creative game! The game taught me that in life, there will always be times when you thought that someone was the "culprit" for doing something that hurt you. As a result, the other innocent party will inevitably get hurt, without even knowing the reason why! That is why we should never jump to conclusions without the relevant evidence. Therefore, effective communication is the key to such situations. From the many motivational books I read, there is actually a core message:    "It is not what happens to us that changes us, it is how we choose to react that creates the state of mind we are in."   Confucius once said that the wise man is one that guards over his door of thoughts. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to be in control, both mental and emotional, whenever something happens that threaten our state of mind. If all of us do so, there will be no hatred, jealousy and most importantly, violence between every living person. Then, a perfect stage will be reached whereby there is true peace where Man ives harmoniously with all things around!

      Finally! The day has come for my inquisitive brain to awaken from its deep slumber. It had been months since I last posted my thoughts or feelings in this private space of mine. Over these few months, several events had occured to slowly but definitely change the way I think and eventually behave.  One of these things is having met my ex-clinical educator, whose name whom I shall not disclose to avoid any trouble. During this short period of time I was with him, he not only taught me the basic essential knowledge to become a better clinician. He did what I felt few clinical educators could. He lit up my fire of passion for the profession. "Endless" discussions of the profession had left their marks in my gullible brain. The result of that attachment was a friendship forged between a mentor and his student. I am extremely grateful for having being under his tutelage because he not only taught me how to be a better clinician but also a better person.  I remember having heard a saying(probably from one of those drama serials) that it is worth waiting ten years of solitude to meet with a worthy teacher. This is especially true for me. Every word that literally comes out from his mouth becomes a memory etched in my subconcious. You may wonder why I am offering praises for someone whom I have just met. Deep down in my heart, I have this feeling that he is the one whom I have waited over the years to confide in. I believe that everyone has someone whom he or she calls "sensei" or master, who will guide the student to their goals. With that, I shall leave you with a quote from Confucius my mentor told me:   "Knowing one's limitations or incompetence is also a form of knowledge. The knowledge that leads to the improvement of oneself."

      Actually, I wanted to comment on the overwhelming chaos that is occuring all over the world currently. However, I heard that Man should learn from the mistakes we made from the past, not recreate them. So today, I shall rest my nonsensical mouth and let the famous people do their talking for me.    Albert Einstein       "Peace cannot be achieved by force, it can only be maintained though understanding"    "The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing."    "Count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self. "    "The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of  thinking we were at when we created them."    "In essence, the conflict that exists today is no more than an old-style struggle for power, once again presented to mankind in semireligious trappings. The difference is that, this time, the development of atomic power has imbued the struggle with a ghostly character; for both parties know and admit that, should the quarrel deteriorate into actual war, mankind is doomed. Despite this knowledge, statesmen in responsible positions on both sides continue to employ the well-known technique of seeking to intimidate and demoralize the opponent by marshaling superior military strength. They do so even though such a policy entails the risk of war and doom. Not one statesman in a position of responsibility has dared to pursue the only course that holds out any promise of peace, the course of supranational security, since for a statesman to follow such a course would be tantamount to political suicide. Political passions, once they have been fanned into flame, exact their victims ... Citater fra..."     Einstein's Unfinished Last Words       Mohandes K. Gandhi       "Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will."    "The things that will destroy us are: politics without principle; pleasure without conscience; wealth without work; knowledge without character; business without morality; science without humanity; and worship without sacrifice."    "Hate the sin and not the sinner is a precept which though easy enough to understand is rarely practiced, and that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world."    "You must be the change you wish to see in the world."    "Whether humanity will consciously follow the law of love, I do not know.  But that need not disturb me. The law will work just as the law of gravitation works, whether we accept it or not.  The person who discovered the law of love was a far greater scientist than any of our modern scientists.  Only our explorations have not gone far enough and so it is not possible for everyone to see all its workings."

           Today, I will do an introduction to one of my FAVOURITE mangas, NARUTO! I started reading it when I saw teenagers in the MRT & along the street reading this manga. I was fascinated at the impact and attraction it had to them and out of curiousity, started reading it! Since the moment I had my hands on it, I couldn't stop! It was simply too irresistable!    The story begins in a concealed village, where a young man hides within a bunch of "leaves". His name is Uzumaki Naruto, a mischievous boy attending the Ninja Academy.  Everyday, he does nothing but causes mischief and making Iruka-sensei mad. And above all, it's doubtful that he'll be able to graduate from the Academy. But Naruto has a dream... A dream that he'll become the head of the Ninja village, following Hokage and will become the best ninja around!  However, all the adults in the village give Naruto cold looks. The truth is, Naruto has a secret about his birth. 12 years ago,  "Kyuubi no Youko"  (Nine Tailed Fox - A kind of evil spirit who tormented the village, was sealed within Naruto's body who was, at the time, a baby. The head of the academy, Mizuki, uses Naruto to steal the "Fuujin Scrolls" and makes Naruto understand his past. Naruto is outraged.  Even with Iruka's help, Naruto just barely defeats Mizuki. Knowing Naruto's secret, Iruka knows Naruto will meet someone who'll help him and so, makes a decision. Naruto is allowed to graduate safely from Ninja Academy. Along with his classmates, Uchiwa Sasuke and Haruno Sakura together, they make their first step as Ninjas!   The following are some of the themes in the manga which I felt are touching and have an underlying meaning to our lifes.      Theme 1  "Hard Work"  Lee's theme is hard work. People think that hard work is lame these days but that's not the case. The author wanted to express that hard work pays off.     Theme 2  "Believe in Yourself"  Humans are separated by differences they are born with but the author want to believe that people can change and wanted to express that. Hinata's theme is "by believing in yourself, you can become a new person."     Theme 3  "Destiny Is .. ?"  The theme for the Neji-Naruto fight is "destiny." The author wanted to express the difference between Neji who believed that destiny can't be changed and suffers within that belief and Naruto who lives to change destiny while looking forward.

      Have you ever asked yourself why you laugh the way you do or why you smile the way you do? Generally speaking, laughter has a two-step action on the physical body:  Step one: it stimulates. Step two: it relaxes . During laughter, the body is stimulated and exercised. After laughter, the body relaxes and calms itself. Laughter is often, therefore, a most effective method for inducing physical and mental relaxation - laughter is a  medicinal relaxant .   The relaxing effects of laughter, as discovered by medical research, include, lowering muscle tension, relaxed sympathetic nervous system, better circulation and a full, deep and healthy respiration pattern. In particular, humour, merriment and mirth are acknowledged as devices for discharging surplus nervous energy. According to modern research, laughter serves as a form of "safety-valve" for the body's energies.   Laughter is often a social signal for calm, for relaxation and for confidence. There is an old English proverb that says, "Laugh to let go" - laughter really can help us to let go of the physical, emotional and mental tensions. Indeed, the therapeutic benefits of  one minute of genuine laughter is thought to be equivalent to approximately forty-five minutes of deep relaxation , according to one piece of recent research. For this reason, laughter is sometimes described as a form of internal massage.  Psychologists have posited over eighty different theories as to why we laugh. One major theory states that laughter has a profound effect on personal perception - we change the way we look at the world when we laugh. Therefore, one reason why we laugh is to change perceptions, alter perspective and create a new view. This is so important for successful stress control because, as the old saying goes, " People are disturbed not by things, but by the view they take of them ,"  Epictetus, 1st century, A.D .  Laughter is such a capable healer when it comes to stress - laughter can fizzle fear; laughter can help us to see the folly of our anxieties; laughter is often a wonderful release during times of mental tension; we laugh to increase our tolerance and understanding. Another major theory of laughter suggests that laughter is an act of liberation and self-superiority: as a medieval poet once penned, "Laughter takes us up, way up high; from a dark bottomless pit, to the fresh, clear blue sky".   For so long, the medical profession has tended to dismiss laughter as being something that merely makes people feel good. The whole point is, however, that "merely" making people feel good is an essential requirement of health, happiness and wholeness - when we feel well, we tend to be well. This is increasingly apparent with the advent of modern mind/body research, psychosomatic medicine and psychoneuroimmunology research.  Laughter is a medicine - it has tangible, physical effects as well as subtle, therapeutic emotional, mental and spiritual effects. The recent upsurge of medical research into mirth, merriment and laughter supports an holistic model for health that considers health to be supported and enhanced by a person's sense of happiness and wholeness. Learning to allow yourself to laugh, to smile, to play, to be joyful and to be happy are essential talents and skills that can create a more permanent foundation for well-being. Humour heals! So stop what you are doing now and laugh!

      Been quite busy recently reading up on some statistics stuff and preparing for my yearly Individual Physical Proficiency Test(IPPT) this  Saturday ! I really wished I had more time to train but I have no choice because if I take it after this week, I will be charged for S$50 for not taking it before my birthday(from what I heard from a friend). The last time I took it, which was like almost  10 months ago , I failed it because of my running. Sob Sob...Physical fitness had never been my forte but recently I decided to adopt a healthy lifestlye, not only to look and feel good, but most importantly to have a healthy body to perform my daily tasks with ease and charm.  The thing that worries me the most is the  2.4km station ! I went training recently by attempting to run 6 rounds about the track(which is 2.4km for your info) and guess what...my engine broke down at the 4th run. Seems like I am still a distance to my target! However, I came up with a strategy recently for running my 2.4km to achieve my target of silver.   ROUND 1 : 1min 50s ROUND 2 : 2min 00s (3min 50s) ROUND 3 : 2min 10s (6min 00s) ROUND 4 : 2min 10s (8min 10s) ROUND 5 : 2min 00s (10min 10s) ROUND 6 : 1min 30s (11min 40s) Total   : 11min 40s(Silver)   Sounds easy and really boosted my confidence for achieving my target. But, I still have some doubts about running this timing. Hmm..seems like I may have to give it a try to see if it is possible. Anyway, a new Korean movie called Windstruck just came out. The female lead  Jun Ji Hyun  and Director of My Sassy Girl  Kwak Jae Yong  are involved in it. The whole thing sounds like a rip-off from  My Sassy Girl . But I don't mind watching it because of the pretty Jun Ji Hyun , hehehe.  The movie's about Kyungjin( starring Jun Ji Hyun ), a righteous but impulsive policewoman, who cannot allow any crime go unnoticed. Myungjoo( starring Jang Hyuk ), a newly-appointed teacher also shared her intolerance on crimes. Kyungjin and Myungjoo¡¯s paths crossed when both of them chased after a thief, interesting incidents happened when Kyungjin mistook Myungjoo as the culprit. A romantic yet hilarious relationship follows. On Kyungjin¡¯s many assignments, Myungjoo will always protect her from afar and help to safe the day. It was during one of Myungjoo¡¯s many attempts to protect Kyungjin when something irreversible and unimaginable happen¡­Catch the show if you are a fan of Korean movies!

      Once a friend shared with me that it was  USELESS  reading motivational books because you will only temporarily experience changes and before you know it, you will be back at square one. That, however, is not the entire fault of the books. They teach us how to make better changes, but it is up to us to MAINTAIN them! That is why we need to remind ourselves constantly about our principles and life values and whether we are living by them. Today, I shall share with you  13 Secrets  which made Anthony Robbins who he is today and also how to make those changes stay!   SECRET #1 : Ask good questions.  SECRET #2 : Intelligently ask for what you want.  SECRET #3 : If you want to be a success, care deeply about what you want - enough to do whatever it takes  SECRET #4 : Never be interested in achieving success. Instead, find compelling reasons that motivate you.  SECRET #5 : Develop passion in your life.  SECRET #6 : Learn from other people.  SECRET #7 : Create value for people  SECRET #8 : Believe in the impossible and it will happen  SECRET #9 : Associate yourself with successful people.  SECRET #10 : Take responsibility and make things happen  SECRET #11 : Always look for ways to make things work.  SECRET #12 : Master the streets  SECRET #13 : Make the habit of making decisions more often   I hope that you will deeply benefit from the above. Now, I shall teach you how to make changes last. Basically, it follows 3 Steps.  Step 1 :  Raise Your Standards  Anytime, you want to make a certain change, the first thing to really do is to RAISE YOUR STANDARDS. Tell yourself what you will NOT accept and what you WANT to become.It will reinforce your actions to making long-lasting changes.  Step 2 :  Change Your Limiting Beliefs  If you raise your standards and don't believe you can meet them, you've already sabotaged yourself! Our beliefs shape every action, every thought and every feeling we experience.  You must develop a sense of certainty that you  can  and  will  meet the new standards before you actually  do !  Step 3 :  Change Your Strategy  Actually, once you have done the above 2 steps, you are already next to success. However to keep your commitment, you need the BEST strategies for achieving results. Once you have set a higher standard and get yourself to believe, you simply  will  find a way. Learn from people who had succeeded in what you are doing and it will save you lots of time and resources.

        "I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of Man to elevate his life by a concious endeavor."   Henry David Thoreau    Interestingly, the first question I asked myself when I woke up today in my bed wasn't questions like, "What time was it?" or "Am I hungry?". I asked myself sincerely," What do I want in my LIFE? ". You must be wondering why I asked myself this question. The reason was because the previous night before I slept, I was reading the biography of Anthony Robbins, or otherwise known affectionately as Tony to many. Anthony Robbins, a high school drop-out, went through much to become what he is today, a multi-millionaire and much-celebrated individual. When I was reading his book, I was asking myself what seperates a successful person from one who wasn't until I came across a quote he wrote.   "It is in the moment of your decisions that your destiny is shaped."   After I read that quote, my heart beat faster and suddenly I saw a path of light in front of me. It seems I have found the answer I was desperately trying to seek all my life. Throughout my life, I realised I had made several bad decisions by actually NOT making any that have lead to what I am today. I knew I was in command of myself that very moment and I shifted the gear from automatic to manual. It was also at that very moment that I was able to visualize my dreams, my goals and my future. Confucius once mentioned that one can become closer to Perfection not only by learning from one's experiences but also from others' failures and successes. How true it is! Do we step into a hole if we saw the person walking infront of us falling into it?   The answer which I was trying to find was actually inside myself all along, hidden to be uncovered.

      Today, I spent my whole day(well...almost the whole day) at Yio Chu Kang stadium giving Rugby players sports massage. Hmmm...This may actually turn into a BUSINESS! It all started when I helped out a friend at SMU to provide sports massage services to Touch Rugby girls last Saturday. The turnout was  TERRIBLE  at best!!! Together with a few friends, we had to fork out roughly $40 to buy a few towels and massage oil.  That's not the worst part.  I was stupid enough to believe that by lowering the service charge to  JUST $2 , people will come to us in hundreds(literally). And, most of the participants were school girls who did not appreciate the effects of sports massage. So, that fateful day, my net profit was -$20.(So, by doing simple mathematics, you could figure out how many "customers" I had.) And, I really felt bad for not being able to pay the "volunteers" any tribute for helping out.  Thanks to one of the Lions Red girls, who really enjoyed my massage last Saturday, I had another chance to recoup my losses and try to earn some profit today. I learnt my lesson(or I should say LESSONS) and I upped the service charges to $5 for 15 minutes despite relatively strong protests from some of my friends. Haha!!! Ended up I had a net profit of ......(drumroll please)... around $100 !!! Also, thanks to the help of the ANG MOHS, who never batted their eyelids twice for giving tips! So, I was able to pay the helpers a decent amount of money for their services and enjoy some myself! And, that's not the BEST! They actually offered me to help out in another subsequent event coming up next week and also a BIG one at PADANG at National Day itself!(Not to mention the fact that I got to know a few more PRETTY girls at the event...muahahaha!) Seems like you will see another DONALD TRUMP in no time!    OUCH! (reality hammer hitting my head.) Ok. Ok. Maybe I may be a bit too ambitious(obnoxious I say). But, heh, what better job do you have that pays you to get to know more people (especially girls with well-defined bods) and widen your social circle! If you know of one, please tell me immediately and I will change my focus!

               I taste like  Bread .   I am a staple in almost everyone's diet. Friends like me are a complement to any other friends. I get on with almost everyone, remaining mostly in the background, but providing substance when it would otherwise be lacking.     What Flavour Are You ?

      Today(or I should say yesterday) was my 23rd Year on this blue planet. Thanks to a bunch of friends, I was given a fabulous treat to a Vegetarian steamboat buffet at a restaurant at Lavender Street. The dimsum there were also very delicious and mouth-watering. After which, we went to a CAMPUS concert by  Jiang Meiqi  and  Penny Tai . It was actually my FIRST time attending a LIVE concert and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, shouting and screaming like any other idolizing teens! We also caught the new Korean movie, Windstruck. I really enjoyed the hilarious act by both the lead actor & actress! I was especially amused at the "surprise" ending! In my memory, today(Yesterday) was actually the best celebrated birthday of my LIFE!  I seldom celebrated my birthday because it is a constant reminder of being born into this world of suffering and torture(sounds pretty pessimistic). Growing up in a Taoist/Buddhist environment, I believe that everyone is born into this world for a purpose: To repay their karma, irregardless whether it is a bad or good one. However, there are a selected few, such as Mother Theresa, that were born to this world to redeem the sins of Mankind and to attempt to educate to us the  Way of God .   This yearly reflection makes me realize one very important thing as it serves as a ringing alarm that  Time and Tide waits for no Man or Woman . As every second, minute, hour and day passes, our cellular components evolves(or degenerates), our body ages and events are occuring all over the world at an astonishing speed. You may think that your action is of no significance to the world, but think again.  One action is the cause of another and this will result in a chain reaction of events, which is beyond the normal comprehension of Mankind. Your actions are also proof that you are  ALIVE  and affecting the world around you in ways you would never believe you ever could. Such can also be said about the act of doing  NOTHING . So, instead of "waiting for the right time", why not do what you always wanted to  NOW ?

       I'M FINALLY BACK!!!  As you can see, it had been days since I last posted my thoughts here. The cause of it was because my computer broke down for no reason whatsoever and I was unable to use it to communicate to the rest of the world via the Web. That's not all. My wallet and Nokia 3660 handphone was stolen while I went swimming in a public pool( luckily the thief was "kind" enough to leave my clothes behind, or else I would be going home in just my swimming trunks ). Goes to show how honest people are nowadays.   You may be thinking I am feeling terribly down now due to these turns in events. I indeed was, at least initially. I was even imagining myself strangling the thief if I ever got to get hold of him. But, strangely, I felt kinda HAPPY after sometime. Because, I know that whenever after something bad happens to me, something equally good, if not better, will happen to me as well(sounds like I am comforting myself). It may not be true, but it sure beats me sulking all day long.  Anyway, I just caught Spiderman 2 on the bigscreen recently. It sure was a great show. Besides the excellent CGI action, the script was also well-written with some twisted humour and thought-provoking quotes. My favourite one is the one about giving up things, even your dreams, for others in you believe in. On the whole, 5 thinbs up. Catch the show at a cinema near you!

      I believe I really need some motivation NOW! Tons of research articles to read and so little time to do my own things! Even I can hear my bed calling out to me! Just had a Psychology lesson this morning about motivation. Well..as usual there are many scholls of thought with varying degrees of belief but the common thing is CHANGE happens only within ourself. Or, to put it in a more easy manner to understand, we can only decide for ourselves whether we want to change or not. Stimulus from the environment, eg. constant nagging from parents, can only provide a keyhole.  We must open the door ourselves .  Speaking of which, I have  TONS  of work to do and no time to waste! Have to stop now!

      This past week had been harsh on me!  2 night lessons stretching until 10pm  and "countless" readings to do! Finally, I knew how tough it was on the seniors. But, I was actually looking forward to the weekend cos the adventure outing at Sentosa me and several others of my committee had organised is COMING SOON! I'm actually looking forward to having fun at Sentosa! However, it seemed like the response wasn't very good and we actually had to coerce them to go. Sob sob...cos we really spend alot of time planning for this outing! Hope it will turn out well.  Anyway, just went for a BBQ at one of lecturer's condo. A few of us actually got lost trying to figure out how to get there. It was meant to be a farewell party for a lecturer who will be leaving ur soon. It rained halfway while we were still BBQing and worst still, there was no shelter for the pit and the poor guys BBQing had to tolerate being rained on while trying to cook. Such irony. Although I never really ate anything much, I sorta enjoyed myself over there, meeting up with a few seniors and finding out their latest "development" at work and also doing some bonding with my juniors. Well...you could say that it turned out pretty well.  Been trying to study consistently recently cos I dun wanna end up getting average results everytime. My goals for myself this semester is to get at least a 'B' for  ALL SUBJECTS !(Hope I can accomplish that!)

      Mosquitoes have four life cycles: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Do not be mistaken. I am not trying to educate you about the life cycle of mosquitoes. But, I just want to ask you a simple question:  Is the life cycle of a human being similar to that of a mosquito?      Yes. We are certainly not breathing through an air tube and obviously don't fly. But, the life cycle of a mosquito and a human is essentially the same, at least to me. To begin with, it starts with birth and ends with death. But, the most striking resemblence is the quality of change in a predictable pattern. Let me illustrate the point to you. The story begins when you are born into this strange and foreign world, to a couple of "nice" people we call parents. We grow and learn to adapt quickly in this mysterious world with several unanswered questions. We intergrate into society and start to socialise with our peers in kindergarden, primary, secondary, tertiary education and finally working life. These experiences change the world we view the world and the way we behave. We get married when we find the "person of our dreams", give birth to a few kids and work hard for our family. Finally, we retire and settle into a life of seclusion and wait for moment when we see no light. Sounds familiar?  A Japanese proverb says, " The nail that sticks out will be hammered down ." Society tries to place many rules on us as individuals as to what is acceptable and what is not. We must decide for ourselves whether to conform to such a social decorum. We are taught as soon as we are old enough to grasp the idea that it is bad to be unique and to avoid being different. At some point, however, we must decide within ourselves whether to spend every day trying to be like everyone else because society says we should or living each day  true  to ourselves.  Our strength as a person is proven through what we decide . E. E. Cummings once said, "To be nobody but yourself - in a world which is doing it's best night and day to make you like everyone else - means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight, and never stop fighting." The benefits of being true to ourselves greatly outweigh any negative aspects of choosing that path.   One of the most obvious advantages of being true to ourselves is that people will see us, perhaps for the first time, without a mask. People will see what we are really like on the inside. They will see our talents, imperfections, and preferences. Then they will have the opportunity to accept us on our own terms. As we work to show our true selves to society, we may discover things about ourselves we did not already know. We all have God-given talents of which we may or may not be aware. After we stop hiding whom we truly are, our talents will have the opportunity to come to the fore. However, at the same time, we are also fearful to expose our weakness and that is why few do so.  Second,  society teaches us to conform by not thinking for ourselves . We are simply told how to solve a problem or accomplish a task. We are never taught why or how something works. If we do not attempt to break out of that mold, we will never get to the point where we wonder why or how things work. A young child constantly asks "Why?" He has yet to realize that it does not matter, according to teachers and leaders of society, why the sky is blue. It only matters that it is blue. Perhaps there is an underlying fear that if we begin to question innocent things like the color of the sky we will one day begin to question government policies, etc. Then we might discover that many "great leaders" in this world have convinced us to believe their version of the truth. But, in my personal opinion,  THAT DAY  is not coming any day soon.

      I&nbsp;cycled to a friend's house in Sengkang from Ang Mo Kio through a route which is quite "ulu". However, the journey was quite scenic if you take away the road and the vehicles moving along it. I especially enjoyed the sounds of the birds and insects while I was cycling along the edge of the "forest".&nbsp; Like the road of life, there were several ups and downs. I was particulary relieved when after every upslope, there would be a downslope. However, I knew that there would soon be another torturous upslope after that and my relief would be short-lived.&nbsp;   I used the time while I was cycling to ponder upon what I had done during the week or since school started. It seemed that I was immersing myself in a seemingly "busy" state.&nbsp; What do I mean by that? It occured to me that I was doing all the unimportant things and worst, trying to make them sound important.&nbsp; During the scenic journey, I recalled that I wasn't really happy since school started, even though the freshies had came in(which meant that there would be more girls to look at...just kidding). I was wasting alot of my time in irrelevant tasks! I could had used the time to do more constructive things like spending more quality time with friends or reading my favourite book.   Most importantly, I believed the cycling trip made me realise that  LIFE  is not only about achieving. It is about sharing your happiness(or sadness for all that matters) with your loved ones and being content with what you have. I had to get my priorities right.&nbsp; After the trip, I felt unusually refreshed(maybe it was the effects of exercise?) I shall end this message with a chapter from   Tao De Jing   written by  Lao Tze.    P.S. For those interested to know how long it took me...The whole trip took me around 35 minutes.   &nbsp;   Contentment     &nbsp;  Health or reputation: which is held dearer?  Health or possessions: which has more worth?  Profit or loss: which is more troublesome?  Great love incurs great expense,  And great riches incur great fear,  But contentment comes at no cost;  Who knows when to stop  Does not continue into danger,  And so may long endure.

      Before I start commenting about anything, I believe it is just right for me to say that my views are not representative of any organisation or individual, except those of my own. Well, it all started with a light-hearted chat with one of my part-time lecturers about the local education system. He commented that the local education system is giving us too much "support" and indirectly killing the need for independent learning. He recalled the experience of his overseas education when all he had for lectures was just a piece of paper with less than a hundred words. Compare that to those in local tertiary education, lecture notes are presented in Powerpoint format with summarized explainations. A similiar experience had also been recounted to me from a previous clinical educator who studied in UK, who told me that the "crappy" education system forced him to take action of his own learning.  This put me in deep thought. I always believed that we were faring well with the amount of information and resources we had access to, compared to those studying overseas. Seems like I could never been more wrong. We seem to be given alot of information to "study" but too little time to reflect upon what we are doing. We seem to be on a  roller coaster ride , only able to go forward at a fast pace with little time to look back. This system has seemingly given students the impression that "everything" will be provided by the school and all we had to do was to follow it. A psychology lecturer once said during a lesson:"  PRACTICE  does not make  PERFECT , it only makes  PERMANENT ." It means that it doesn't really matter how many times you do it, if you started out the wrong direction, chances are you are going to do it wrongly everytime and believe that you are going to do it correctly  SOMEDAY . All this seems to be leading to a future which I do not even dare to imagine.  It seems that alot of us, including myself, have been taking granted our education and our future, into the hands of a system that claims to produce the best. If we do not question the very things that we are given, who else will? Great people were made from situations that placed them in dire straits, forcing them to take on the problems face-to-face. I certainly hope that I do not have to wait for a catastrophe to happen before I change the way I learn. So, the next time you get a skimpy note, put your hands together and  THANK GOD  that you have been given a chance to exert your learning power.

      Today, a classmate of mine told me I was always very formal and "unhumorous", possibly relative to someone in my class who is more extroverted, and she also commented that communicating with me always makes her very uncomfortable. In my own defense, I think I tend to open up to selected people only(actually I dare say I do not open up to anyone in my school except a few as a matter of fact), possibly because I am afraid to show my inner side. A typical Cancerian, I believe myself to be hard on the outside, but soft on the inside. Meaning that I may seem to be unapproachable and "emotionless", but I am actually a sensitive and caring person to those who know me well enough(Only a handful do) and I believe I have a perspective of things few others identify with. So I was compelled to do a personality test on  urlLink  Colorgenics   to find out more about myself. Quite accurate I would say.  Try it !   You are a very  sensitive  person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favorable impressions and to be recognized by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavors go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard.  Which ever way you turn you feel that you are being utterly thwarted. There is considerable conflict in the air but you will stick to your beliefs and not be deterred in endeavouring to attain your objectives.  You need a friend - a close friend - and you are willing to become emotionally involved with the right person, but you are very demanding and particular in your choice of partners. You are constantly looking for reassurance and it is perhaps because of this that you tend to be somewhat argumentative, but you try to hold back - careful to avoid open conflict - since this might reduce your prospects of realizing your hopes of establishing a warm caring relationship.  For whatever the reason, you find it extremely difficult to sustain relationships - that is to sustain them in the manner that you would wish. You are a very gentle sort of person, full of feeling, sensitivity and susceptible to love and affection, looking and longing for a partner with whom you can enjoy 'All things bright and beautiful' - someone with whom you can seek out the more esoteric things of life. But up to now this person has only existed in your imagination. You are very choosy, appreciative, refined and extremely artistic in temperament and it is your hope to seek others who will allow you to form and express your own taste and judgement and who at the same time may assist you in your intellectual or artistic growth.  You are being very dogmatic, insisting that there is to be absolutely no equivocation whatsoever about your achievements and accomplishments.

      I am no fan of politics but I have avidly followed the life of respected leaders such as the late Mr Ong Teng Cheong and SM Lee Kuan Yew. It all started when I unintentionally came upon a pictorial of the late Mr Ong, our humble previous president. Their life story has brought much inspiration and hope to me as a citizen of Singapore. As Singapore is going to move into a new of phase of leadership in our government, let us take a look at the story of the man who made the transition smooth. I will start with the first of the four parts of the life story of the very much respected Mr Goh Chok Tong, where we will take a more closer look at the life of him when he was a youth.       Part I   The year is 1959.   This story is about a young man whose destiny it was to become one of the most influential figures in Singapore.  Even as a student the young Goh Chok Tong showed considerable leadership qualities.  He was Vice Head Prefect, class monitor and Editor of the school magazine and also school swimming capatain -- you might call him somewhat of an over-achiever.  Fellow classmate and now MP Tan Cheng Bock recalls a time he was literally fished out of the river by Mr Goh, "He pulled me out of a deep river once. Really, really! We were hiking, you see I have to assess him, whether he can pass his first class badge or not as a scout. So I'm actually like the observer. I can fail him if i want to if he doesn't make the mark. So I remember we went to this river and I didn't know it was so deep. We went in. But he's still up to his shoulder. So he just yanked me out! But that was good fun!"  His extra curricular activities aside, Mr Goh was most often remembered as a serious student.  In a citation given to NUS Society members, Nominated MP Chandra Mohan Nair said while fellow students were reading comic books, Mr Goh would be reading economic books.  Those who knew the young Goh Chok Tong described him as studious.  Dr Tan remembers being baffled by Mr Goh's reading collection, "He was very very studious, when I visited him, years ago to his room, my goodness, you should see the books he was reading! Gosh! They were all Russian authors which don't make sense to me but, the names all sound very intellectual you know? Those sort of books that he was reading? We were not. We were down to our own school books. So at that level already he was so way ahead already."  67-year-old S Puhaindran was a young teacher in Raffles Institution when Mr Goh was a student there.  He remembers the young Goh Chok Tong as a dependable and upright student, "I was a young teacher, he was a Pre-U 2 student. I remember him as someone who was quite scholarly, one of those students even teachers respect. He was a prefect and he carried himself very well and he was popular among his own schoolmates and so on. I was actually a scout master then also, and he was an ex-scout. He was the type who would talk quietly to those who misbehave, that kind of thing, and get them to pull up their socks you know? Teachers could depend on him."  Could Mr Goh have been the ubiquitous nerd in school?  Well, those who knew him as a student wouldn't go that far in describing him, but classmate and friend Tan Cheng Bock recalls a young man who was rather prim, "He's very prim and very correct. He's not so playful like us. When we did our rock and roll he won't even stand up and do the rock and roll. He'll sit there in one corner and even watch us."  It was perhaps that attitude gleaned from the early years that prompted then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to describe Mr Goh as being rather wooden.  Mr Goh himself admitted to this in his national day rally speech last year when he touched on his political transition, "In 1990, before I became Prime Minister, SM advised me to be tough and be feared. But I thought it best to be myself, and not try to act tough. In 1988 during a talk to NUS students, SM said I was too "wooden", and advised me to see a psychiatrist, to loosen up. I learnt to loosen up, without seeing a psychiatrist. My point is, I found my own way to communicate with you, the people."   Those who have followed Mr Goh's career agree that he's changed over the years.  From a stiff politician, Mr Goh has grown to be a warm, caring and approachable leader.  Political commentator Viswa Sadasivan says, "He's become a lot more confident of his policies, a lot more confident of his style of governance which is very collegiate and people driven. His consultative style is very much a function of that. He has also become a lot more confident about communicating his views in his own way without actually trying to be somebody else."  Taking over from Lee Kuan Yew is a hard act to follow for anyone.  Mr Viswa recalls the years when Mr Goh was still trying to find his own style of governance, "I recall in the initial years of the National Day Rally he tried in the first couple of years I think, he tries using PM Lee's style of using charts at the rally and it didn't quite fit his own personal style so he evolved his own style of communicating. Even the way he communicated at the National Day Rally was completely different from how PM Lee managed the rally. It was a lot more personalised. It was a lot more anecdotal. Even his analogies, people are not quite impressed with his analogies but it was his own brand, his own style. And I think over time, people have come to accept him as Goh Chok Tong the Prime Minister and not see him as Goh Chok Tong the Prime Minister by default."  Dr Tan attributes this change not so much with the need to be popular with the people but to Mr Goh's own personality, "I think basically he has that in him already. It's not that he wants to act it out you see. Because if you act it out, it's different. Because in school you know, he's very caring, he'll join us when we want him to do something, he'll join us, he'll never question. See when i cooked, he washed the pots! See he doesn't complain he just go along with us, and he'll join us, he's very sporting in that sense."  Over the next 14 years, Mr Goh has proved his own mettle as a Prime Minister -- winning over the hearts and minds of Singaporeans.  Even pointed comments in the early years that Mr Goh was a mere seat-warmer for Lee Hsien Loong has long dissipated.   Nominated MP Chandra Mohan Nair echoed the view of many, "If the label seat warmer had been true, by now the seats would have been burnt totally! Definitely he's not a seat warmer. I think he's been with us more than a decade and that surely cannot be labeled as seat warming unless you've got a really warped definition of seat warming. I think he has been given the chance to be prime minister and I think has proven to our country and to this region and the world at large that he's a very capable leader. I think at the end of the day the lesson learnt is that give a guy a chance and probably he will prove that he is capable of doing things."  From awkward youth to astute politician -- join me again as we trace Mr Goh's contribution to Singapore and Singaporeans.
