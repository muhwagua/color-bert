      I'm happy to announce that my dog has arrived and is doing well. She was a bit emaciated, but that didn't affect her energy level. She is especially happy that she has a large yard to run around in, and no longer has to be tied to a chain. We are a bit worried that she can dig her way under the fence, so we haven't left her outside while we aren't at home....Until today.  When I left for work, she was outside and had her food and water handy. She has shelter under the deck, and when it starts to get cold outside, I'll leave the back garage door open for her to come in and warm up. I hope that she is still in the backyard when I get home!  On other notes, my  urlLink cat had kittens Saturday ....It was quite a shock for us, but I can report that mom and babies are doing just great (as long as we keep them away from the dog.) We also took a sight seeing, soul healing trip to  urlLink Rocky Mountain National Park  on Saturday with Bruce, Lisa and Jackie. They were nice enough to rent a mini-van and take us all up.  urlLink It was a great day  and we got to see a lot of what this great state has to offer.  In other, more personal news....I'm still grappling with timelessness. The concept is so difficult to accept, that I may be forced to abandon trying, and start reading a different book :-)  I know now why people take to religion so easily...It gives them a way to explain away the unexplainable, and be more self-actualizing in their actions. It's sad really. I will continue to attempt enlightenment, if there really is such a thing.  Also, I'm still curious why people do stupid things. Most of us have a basic view of what morals and ethics are, and sometimes, someone will just go off the deep end and forget these things. I sure would like to know what mental process makes this happen. It could be emotions. As I have found, emotions are a powerful distracting force, which lead to nothing but trouble. Think about this, if we could control, or even eliminate our emotions, there would be far less crime in the world.  I'm not telling everyone to become Vulcans, but emotions have to be controlled, even quelled, to keep us sane and on level ground. Remember, there is no joy in experience, only in realization.

      This morning, after a wait of four months, I'm FINALLY going to get my dog. She has been holed up at my old house in Virginia since I left. I was supposed to get her in early August, but like everything else associated with Virginia...that plan fell through.  A dear friend who lives a bit west of here was in Virginia this week and offered to pick up my dog on the way back. It's nice to know good people!  We are all prepared for her...I bought food, treats, and most importantly, dog shampoo. My friend called me from the road and told me the dog stinks. At least it looks like the she has been getting food these past months, but her disposition is what worries me. She has seen a lot of changes recently...but she will do well here. She has a nice big yard to play in, and we plan on taking her walking/hiking whenever we go.  The dog represents my last "real" emotional link to Virginia...getting her here will bring closure to a lot of things. I'll post pics later!

      So...how did your "day of realizing your preconceptions" go?   Unfortunately, I'm not the "trained mind" I want to be yet, so I spent the day being the same Eric I've been for the past few months. I even caught myself actually having emotion this evening for someone who really doesn't deserve it. I was accused of being "soft hearted."  Lemme think about that...yes, so I am soft hearted. Every major emotional event in life seems to stay with me for extended periods. I remember in High School, my girlfriend dumped me, and I failed to grad on time as a result. In the Air Force, my girlfriend dumped me and I spend months in self-imposed solitary in my dorm room. The list goes on and on.  This is one of the reasons I have been studying the concept of "timelessness." This has a lot to do with not pondering the past, because it causes remorse; not focusing on the future, because it leads to ambition and fear; and in the present, the focus is on self and ultimately leads to embarassment. So what am I to do? Apparently, living moment to moment is not the same as living in the present. What?? I still have a lot to learn, and as I do, I'll share it here (oh joy).  The concept of timelessness...hmmmm, I'll post more on this another time. I'm tired and want to go to sleep :-)

      An interesting transformation is taking place internally with me. If any of you are familiar with "bracketing," it can be very revealing as to the kind of being you are.  Try this during a normal day. Carry around a small pad or notebook. Everythime you encounter some sort of stumili that brings up a preconceived notion or feeling, write that down and place it in[brackets]. After a full day, look over your pad in the evening before bed...  Now, make a determination to NOT face the next day with any of these preconceptions...no matter how trivial!  Trust me...you will begin to look at yourself differently.  More to come on this...

      When you make really big mistakes in life, or something happens that you will regret, how do you react? I've been studying some texts based on Pure Land Shin, that describes events that meet this criteria are actually beneficial to you.   In other words, it's the old axiom of, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.   This is an interesting way to look at things, especially if you have a life that is full of regrets. If you turn these regrets and mistakes into something good and beneficial, how can you lose?

      I got back on the bike today for 14 miles. I tried a different twist, and ran my normal 7 mile loop in reverse...twice. It was such a beautiful day that I just couldn't resist.  When I got back home, I cleaned up the bike and fixed Sean's Trek so that he was more comfortable with it. His trouble is his inability to properly use his gears. We are working on that though :-)  I plan to ride every day again. I put it on hold for a while when the boys got here so they could get the attention they need and get settle in. Now, I'm back to getting in shape again. Feels pretty good too!

Now, having read that, here's an  urlLink altavista  translation of part of a news story I found  urlLink here ...  ---Begin Clip  This resolution should emphasize the role of the United Nations, which regulate delivery of the sovereignty to an Iraqi government and create a clear legal framework for international assistance, is called it in Luxembourg. Rings around common position But all Ministers are not this view. Great Britain can make friends itself also with the American draft, which is appropriate for to time on the table, which however France and Germany reject. These two countries criticize that the USA do not seem ready to deliver the civilian administration as soon as possible to an Iraqi government. Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs Joschka Fischer explained as the rope pulling around a uniform position in the European union: "the negotiations over a resolution will be continued to continue in this week. Still it is too early, in order to say already today whether it will give this resolution or not. Like always we behave constructionally."  --End Clip  Now that's not too bad, is it??  :-)

      Trying to revamp a mental attitude that has been ingrained into you since birth is rather difficult. For example, the western culture tells us to use our intellect and analyze everything. We analyze our little heart out every day.  So, what happens when we let go of our intellect? How does the world appear? Is what we see daily actually Reality, or is it what our intellects perceive Reality to be? Do we make our own realities to suit our mental capacity, and therefore completely bypass the true Reality?  Change is good.

      Yet another post on the continuing saga of bedtime. Last night, I hit the hay around 10:30 (after a rather rousing couple of episodes of  urlLink MXC ), and was hopeful that I would be refreshed and ready in the morning...thus debunking my "go to bed late theory." Well, I got up at 6 almost ready to go.  Two factors that contributed to this could severly affect my research...  1) I looked at the clock, and realized it was Friday 2) I didn't get up for my normal early morning pee, and therefore did not turn on the coffe pot.  In the first case, it is very easy to get up on Fridays, therefore my research results have been tainted. In the second case, my 4:30am "pee, then turn on the coffe pot" encouraged me in two seperate, yet very important, ways to get out of bed.  In the future, I won't record results for Sunday nights or Thursday nights. Monday thru Wednesday only.  Here are this weeks tallies...  MONDAY NIGHT - Bed at 9:30pm, up at 6:45 (late) and in foul, tired mood all day. TUESDAY NIGHT - Bed after midnight, up at 6am refreshed and ready to challenge the day. WEDNESDAY NIGHT - Bed at 1am, up at 5:30 am refreshed and ready for the day. Note, however that after lunch, I was worthless for the rest of the day...this explains the earlier bedtim Thursday night. Also, I spent two hours grocery shopping.)  So there you go, another week of serious sleep research.  Now, if I could only  urlLink remember  what I did with my wallet.

      I think I'm going to give up on this whole "timelessness" concept. Maybe my mind is just way too closed to contemplate it further.   Let's switch to perceptions of reality. Now, I know that everyone has a different perception of reality, but the primary difference in this aspect would be between males and females. Below is a small excerpt from a project that I'm currently working on that introduces the differences...  ---Begin Exerpt "I’m not very good at remembering specific dates, unless it has something to do with an historical event…like war. I think there are probably a lot of guys like that, and it is mainly guys. For example, ask any guy with cable what his favorite channels are and I’ll bet that The History Channel, Discovery, and A&E are in the top 10. Women are different in general; they tend to remember dates and places from their own experience, like birthdays, anniversaries, etc. I’m not exactly sure what the reasoning is behind this but let’s just say that men and women are different in their overall perception of their existence. On the other side of this argument, I noticed that when I was in school, the females tended to do much better in history class, and guys don’t tend to get really into history until after high school. This has nothing to do with the fact that women mature faster than men; it’s all priority and perception of reality.  Is this genetic? Is it socially programmed? There are many arguments as to why these differences exist. Your average hyper-christian, for example, is ravenously misogynistic, and therefore will argue the inferiority and frailty of women. He will also quote you all kinds of bible passages that tell us that men are superior to women. He will, however, tolerate a powerful and successful women…he just would consider her a “sinner.” The muslim will take it even further, with fundamentalists actually killing or beating a woman who shows any kind of self governance. The fact is, however, that the difference between a man and woman (in mental terms) is their perception of their own reality. If we all accepted the True reality (if it can ever be agreed upon as to what It is), then the difference would simply be physiological, not to mention it would be the end of war and suffering."  ---End Exerpt  I plan on exploring this further as my project rolls along. In the meantime, it would be nice to get some feedback on this!

      I found out over the weekend that someone I grew up with ( a next door neighbor) passed away in his sleep. He was my age. Just goes to show that you can go at anytime.  Another thing I was thinking about this weekend was memory. Your memory serves as a picture album of your past. You remember the good and the bad. I was watching VH1-Classic abd several vids came on that reminded me of high school. I began to wax nostalgic and even got a tear in my eye. That's when the memory thing hit me....you can't re-live your past, but you have this wonderful thing called memory that keeps a record of it for you so it always keeps you company.  ...then I remembered that I'm supposed to be supressing emotions, since they only get you into trouble...so I shut off the TV and stereo immediately and got back to  urlLink reading a book .

      Headache Day 6  Interesting that I felt great last night and wake up this morning with my head in a vise. It usualy works the other way around!  I was hoping to do some work on the scooter today, but I can't paint anything because of the cold (20s today with lows in the 0s tonight). I'm not afraid of the cold, mind you, but you can't use spray paint when the temp is under 50F. Sean and I may just work on our models today. He got a  urlLink P-61 , and I got a  urlLink PanzerV.   The hobby stores here are a bit lacking. They have the  urlLink Tamiya sets  (tanks, trucks, figures, miniatures) but not the  urlLink Hasegawa  that I'm used to. I remember building Hasegawa sets as a teenager...complete with  urlLink ground crews, utility trailers, everything . I'll give Tamiya a try, and if the Panther builds well, I'll add to the set. They do have some cool stuff...I saw a Pak40 AT gun and a REALLY nice Flak88, all complete with the crews. They have every WWII era tank (and truck!) imaginable too, I decided to go with the PantherV to whet my wistle a bit.  My only complaint with Tamiya is their molding colors. It's kind of a tan color...probably good if it came with Afrika Korps markings, but no good for my use. I'll be using my grey primer to give it the panzer-grey look. I'll try and get some pics up today here in the blog, and I may be adding some snow pics to the site tonight as well (or maybe tomorrow, damn weatherman!)

      I think all of that acetone and spray paint on Saturday effected me somehow...I had the worst headache I've ever had last night, and it continues this morning. I never get headaches, so this is the only excuse I can think of. I had the garage door open, the fan blowing, and I wore a mask while I was working, but I guess things got to me anyway.  I've also had HORRIBLE heartburn lately. I haven't had heartburn for a couple of years now.   I'll make sure that when I start working in the garage again, I go easier on the acetone :-) ....if that indeed is the problem. Of course, I could be having a heart attack, and could be dead by afternoon....  ...either way is cool.

      Scooter update, Stage 1:  I took everything off of the main frame, and began to sand some of the multiple layers of paint off of it. You can see in this pic that the forks have been completely stripped. Luckily, they only had a single layer of cheap spray paint on them, so it was easy to get to the bare metal.     The wheels are plastic, and had been heavily painted with red spray paint. Note in the pic below how the brakes had rubbed some of the paint off of the outer edges. I'm not sure how I'm going to approach this yet...stay tuned :-)     As you can see below, the forks cleaned up nicely...     ...and the primer stuck very well. I'll add a second coat, then paint them final color next week.     Ths pic below shows one of the many decals that have to be removed. Notice the multiple layers of paint on the frame. I'll be unable to strip it all on this budget, so I'm rubbing the entire thing down with acetone, coarse sanding, then fine sanding it. I would have gotten more completed yesterday, but my drill ran out of juice and I got tired of hand-sanding. It won't be bare metal, but should be clean enough to hold the primer and paint.     I also cleaned the plastic foot pad and have all brake parts soaking in acetone (no pads though, they were shot)  Updates as they are complete!

       urlLink Once again, the daily news shows us the dangers of religion.   I just can't understand this whole "my god is better than your god" thing....especially when these people claim to be killing in the name of a god. It has been going on since the beginning of history, and ALL religions are guilty.  Would an all loving, peaceful, omnipitent and omnipresent being really CARE in the first place? It's insanity!

      It's a Friday evening....this has been a good day.  After work, I stopped at Wal Mart to pick up some stuff I need for the scooter restoration. The boys had this ugly-assed scooter that some criminal teenage fucker gave them shipped out here to Colorado. The dry-rotted tires promptly disintegrated, and the rest of the thing was in horrid shape. I decided that since it represented some terrible memories, that I would completely dismantle it and rebuild it. This will be a representation of my tearing down the old life and building a new one. This should do more for me psychologically than simply throwing it out.  I still need to get some new carriage bolts, tires, tubes, brake pads (although I may just replace the entire brake system), cables, bar and bar grips. I'm painting it gloss black and metal flake midnight blue.  Stay tuned to this blog for some before and after pics!

      I finally will have to break down and buy a humidifier. Since the weather turned cool, I've noticed that static shocks in my house have risen 67%. Not to mention the difficulty breathing in the evening time.   I was hoping to get through the winter without one, but with all of the cool electronic shit I have, I'd hate to blow something up with a static shock. As for the breathing...well, the kids are OK, it's just me. After 35 years in humid climates, the dryness is not as easy to get used to.

After three days of low clouds, it came out this morning looking great!   So, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger...I've been thinking a lot about that over the past few days, and maybe it is indeed true. I spent all yesterday in a funk over several issues...money, the pending divorce, child care, money, and money. Last night at bedtime, I put it all to bed with me, and woke up this AM feeling a bit better. All of the trials you face in life can't kill you if you don't let them, and in the grand scheme, everything eventually works itself out.  What fun.

      I finally got the basement cleared of my stuff and am all moved into the upstairs master bedroom. It's big enough to have my computer desk and radio desk seperated, and have plenty of room for all of my other crap. Too bad I'll have to move in six months, it was a pain in the ass getting all of my suff moved up two flights of stairs. I did manage to get rid of a lot of old junk though, I'm trying to keep the junk level down so that my house doesn't turn into the sty that I lived in back in Virginia. It will also make the move easier.  Why move? Well, I need something cheaper and smaller. There are a bunch of smaller and cheaper houses in the same neighborhood that are always coming up for sale...so time will tell. Hell, if I can find something sooner, I might break my lease and move earlier :-)   I gave the basement over to Sean, so he can have his own hang out ala "That 70s Show." He has cable, VCR, DVD, dart board, weight set, even a bathroom w/shower.  Wish I had it that good at his age! He has great friends who are always polite and friendly (and respectful) with me...I just wish they wouldn't ring the phone so late at night! He has a 9pm weekday limit, but since they are out of school, I'm giving him a little leeway.   Damn I can't wait until school starts again!!

I've seen old ladies pushed aside during mad dashes to the electronics department...very sad. I surely was not friendly to those people when they got to my counter.   Them:"Do you have Nintendo 64?"

      From ...   urlLink http://www.nsu.ru/filf/pha/humour/chicken.htm   Question: WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD?  PHILOSOPHERS et al. ANSWER:  Plato: For the greater good.  Karl Marx: It was an historical inevitability.  Thomas de Torquemada: Give me ten minutes with the chicken and I'll find out.  Timothy Leary: Because that's the only kind of trip the Establishment would let it take.  Douglas Adams: Forty-two.  Nietzsche: Because if you gaze too long across the Road, the Road gazes also across you.  Oliver North: National Security was at stake.  Carl Jung: The confluence of events in the cultural gestalt necessitated that individual chickens cross roads at this historical juncture, and therefore synchronicitously brought such occurrences into being.  Jean-Paul Sartre: In order to act in good faith and be true to itself, the chicken found it necessary to cross the road.  Ludwig Wittgenstein: The possibility of "crossing" was encoded into the objects "chicken" and "road," and circumstances came into being which caused the actualization of this potential occurrence.  Albert Einstein: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road crossed the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.  Aristotle: To actualize its potential.  Buddha: If you ask this question, you deny your own chicken-nature.  Salvador Dali: The Fish.  Darwin: It was the logical next step after coming down from the trees.  Emily Dickinson: Because it could not stop for death. Epicurus: For fun.  Ralph Waldo Emerson: It didn't cross the road; it transcended it.  Johann Friedrich von Goethe: The eternal hen-principle made it do it.  Ernest Hemingway: To die. In the rain.  Werner Heisenberg: We are not sure which side of the road the chicken was on, but it was moving very fast.  David Hume: Out of custom and habit.  Saddam Hussein: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.  Jack Nicholson: 'cause it (censored) wanted to. That's the (censored) reason.  Pyrrho the Skeptic: What road?  Ronald Reagan: I forget.  John Sununu: The Air Force was only too happy to provide the transportation, so quite understandably the chicken availed himself of the opportunity.  The Sphinx: You tell me.  Sappho: Due to the loveliness of the hen on the other side, more fair than all of Hellas' fine armies.  Henry David Thoreau: To live deliberately ... and suck all the marrow out of life.  Mark Twain: The news of its crossing has been greatly exaggerated.  Stephen Jay Gould: It is possible that there is a sociobiological explanation for it, but we have been deluged in recent years with sociobiological stories despite the fact that we have little direct evidence about the genetics of behavior, and we do not know how to obtain it for the specific behaviors that figure most prominently in sociobiological speculation.  Joseph Stalin: I don't care. Catch it. Crack its eggs to make my omlette.  Captain James T. Kirk: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.  Machiavelli: So that its subjects will view it with admiration, as a chicken which has the daring and courage to boldly cross the road, but also with fear, for whom among them has the strength to contend with such a paragon of avian virtue? In such a manner is the princely chicken's dominion maintained.  Hippocrates: Because of an excess of pleghm in its pancreas.  Andersen Con sultant: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening its dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market. Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model (PIM) Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework. Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with Andersen consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park like setting enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear, and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total business integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the chicken change to become more successful.

It got me to thinking about the old saying that "bad things happen to good people," and this event seemed to re-inforce that notion.  Then I realized that bad things happen to every part of society...the good ones just get the press. I'm sure there's a lot of scumbags getting their due on a daily basis...we just don't hear about it.  ...so, there is no divine plan that takes the good ones first...or the bad ones last...it's just life, so deal with it.

In the words of  urlLink Rodney Carrington ..."Damn it's cold out there...I ain't seen my nuts in three days."

      Well,  urlLink Tommy boy, this is a keen idea.  But...aren't you forgetting something? Are you not forgetting the EASIEST way for people to enter the country illegally?  I think you are sealing the wrong border Mr. Ridge...nothing in this plan makes any kind of provision for securing our "open borders." Is it because it is a political hot potato? Would you jeopardize the safety of American citizens because some lobby tells you to keep the pourus US border open-wide?  For shame! Alex is right on this one :-(

      I finally see what a winter is _supposed_ to be like. We got some snow this weekend and went on a couple of walkabouts to experience it. Man, winter is just so damned cool! Walking around in the snow, seeing the beauty that it brings, the quiet it brings to the neighborhood, the brightness of the nights...this is what winter IS.  ...oh, I forgot, I have to drive to work tomorrow in this stuff :-)

      I guess the only way to make a splash nowadays as a celebrity is to get into trouble. Maybe now, after so many years of being ignored,  urlLink Rush  can get some needed recognition :-)  I hope this doesn't affect the 30th anniversary tour this summer!

      Well...it seems that the winter season is gonna be a bit short this year...and that means...MOUNTAIN BIKING!  I tried it out last weekend to make sure I still remembered how and did 7 miles...not too shabby. Next week, I'll start riding to work. I got some new pedals on ebay (I love ebay...I REALLY love ebay), now I'm looking into some different tires. I plan to get a little more crazy this year so I'm looking for better off-road tires....and I'll probably go tubeless too.  Pics forthcoming.

      Woke up this morning to a beautiful fresh blanket of snow on the ground. Man this is a great town!  Speaking of "town"...there are a half a million people here (270,000 in the city limits, the rest in the surrounding county)...yet when I speak to people back in the swamps (the town I'm from) they think it's a squat country town. I constantly get asked "Is there a Wal-Mart there?" ...yes, there are four of them...."Do you have a Target?" ...yes, again, several..."Do you have such and such?" ...yes, chances are we do. Even in the very off-chance that we don't have something here, Denver is a short scamp up I-25...they have everything there.  I guess it's a good thing they think we are in the sticks...keeps them from moving here ;-)  Damn easterners!

      So, it looks like it's  urlLink Bush vs. Kerry .  Lurch the Liberal vs. The semi-fascist Theocrat...looks like yet another election to decide which one of two boneheads will become the most powerful man in the world. It's a given that I won't be voting for Bush...but I'm not at all thrilled about Lurch...Nader is out of the question...and I don't want to stay home on election day.   What a conundrum!!! What to do then? What a position to put the American people into.

      I forgot to post this yesterday, but it was my 1 year anniversary of moving from hell to Colorado. I'm "Out of the Den and into the Rockies!"  Anyhoo, while the kids were swimming, I went on an afternoon hike along the Columbine trail in N. Cheyenne Canyon on Sunday. If I ever need a reminder of why I'm here, this hike is a good one to take :-) Of course, I can think of MANY reminders...and they will be available in list form when the UNDERGROUND arrives next month...are you ready for the UNDERGROUND?  All will be revealed...all will be told...nothing will be held back! The UNDERGROUND is coming.

      I love this political season. I love seeing each side fire it's salvos at the other....it's so hilarious! As Bush said to the Iraqi resistance "Bring it on!"  ...by the way, why the hell did he say that? I sure am glad he is praying to his god for  "less casualties."....hey, George, how about NO casualties? And speaking of casualties, have you noticed how the pentagoners are now starting to report "insurgent" deaths alongside American troop deaths? It's like..."Well, they got 8 of our soldiers, but we got 40 of them!!"...give me a fucking break.  "God told me I'd be President" - George W. Bush "God told me to kill my children" - Deanna LaJune Laney  ...I love election season!

      Today started out pretty normally for a summer Friday. I got up, got Richie up, and Sean was "already up." I took a shower, got Rich dressed, packed his lunch for his field trip (since school is out, his daycare has trips), had my coffee and got ready to leave.  At this point, I noticed that the weather was perfect (again) so my bud Bruce and I decided to ride the  urlLink scoots  in. So, I loaded up the Richster and drove him to daycare and me to work. This damn  urlLink Yamaha  of mine if perfect for this place, and the gas mileage (about 70mpg) can't be beat.   We picked the kids up in the afternoon and had a little ride home...the kids absolutely love  urlLink these things , and so do the adults :-)  At any rate, a nice Friday!

      OK folks...this is the start of YET ANOTHER website overhaul. It is prompted by my decision not to renew my domain. I never have the time to update pics and such anymore, so why bother with the trouble!     I'll be putting up a basic site soon, and emails will go out with the address. I also hope to put more up here (yeah, right). Oh, and forget about the UNDERGROUND....I had to give up on it, too much work.
