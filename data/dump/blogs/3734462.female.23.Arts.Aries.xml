      i read a the abbot's blog about soulmates. i perfectly adore the comments. i used to beleive in soulmates aka 'destiny'. it is such crap for me now. i used to beleive that my ex was the one. i saw signs...actually, we did..everybody did. then things happened again...for reasons i can never explain.i am lost in space. i feel like i am a speck of dust in this universe. i dont even know the answer to a simple question of "why".  it has been two months of no communication. i do hate him. it was a lie when i said i forgave him for i havnt moved on.i still feel the sting in my veins. i can hear the laughter of his family behind my ears every single waking  moment in my life. was it his choice or theirs?? it doesnt matter..for he didnt give a fight. he just gave in. Now i question the four years that we shared. I may be mean. i may be cruel. I am just finding my way back again. i will never survive this pain knowing that i have not done nothing..like he did.  Do you know how it feels late at night when you feel your ur heart is just like being crushed into a pit of fuckin emotions? i never cursed in my blogs before. i never felt such hatred. Its sinking in. This is the moment that i always avoided. to hate him.to dispise him.But feeling this way is inevitable. i feel my emotions is going 6 feet under. and all that will be left is anger..hate.  when we parted, i shut my doors to everyone.i shut myself in a hallow box.there is no light for me to see. im blinded by everything. i shut it so tight that there is no air for me to breath.So tell me, is there such a thing called "soulmate"? maybe.... maybe not. but this i know and proved, that there is a thing called pain.there is a thing called anger. there are tears.   i always say that penguins are the most devoted creature in this world. they spend all their life looking for their mate..and when they found it.they will never be apart.they will stick together. that is "devotion" that is more than love. maybe that is the reason of why they have wings but they dont fly. Not like us. we dont have wings but we try to soar far away...we are never satisfied.  Cliche as it sounds but i know this is tru.." you will only know the importance of someone when they are gone" i feel that im joining the winds....like a grain of sand that was lost before..i will pick myself up and make a diffrence in my life. i still feel the "hate".

      I once read that "Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.". i know that all this pain that i feel is caused by myself. For the reasons that i havnt forgotten nor have forgiven the person who caused this. Many times i told myself that I am ok. I have forgiven. I dont want to hate.that will be the last thing i want to do. For so long I have searched for answers on how to make my life a complete solace. I have loved. I loved more than myself. For love cannot be measured.A person under the spell acnnot say i will devote myself to you 80% and the rest is for mine. For when you love, you love without limitations.Surpass even your own restrictions.  Dont get me wrong, I can say that being with Him was the best and happiest moments of my life. I learned a lot.On how to be a woman as i am now.On how to love without expectaions. He was not just someone im inlove with..but he was a companion..a bestfriend...then was a fiance.  They say things happen for a reason.That was what is inculcated in my head right now.So there is no room for hate..for questions.I did not say anything. I diod not ask. I swallowed the circumstances like a bitter pill.  "Beware of the man who does not return your blow: he neither forgives you nor allows you to forgive yourself." Maybe i shoul have asked why. It would be better if i hurt him. but i did not. I was not given a chance to do so. So here i am.   Always forgive your enemies—but never forget their names.As i type this down, I realized that "forgiveness" is not for anybody else. Forgiveness is for myself. I have to let go. I have to Forgive. Not for him. But for me to regain myuself again.   But is forgiving also forgetting? let me know.

      i lost my soul. i often wander around.walking like a faceless being. emotionless and numb. i remember not long ago..when i used to dance under the rain. lying on the wet earth. it bothers me not if all the dirt is smudged on my face... i would lay down in the cold wet ground...until my eyes sees nothing but blurry images.  i remember not long ago when i can ran naked across the room. it bothers me not if i have my imperfections, for my imperfection is my being. not too long ago..i can close my eyes and fear nothing. i would roam my world freely...i care not if i stumble and fall.. there is no such fear in my head everytime its dark.. for in my heart of hearts i know... i am not alone.  maybe life is not a box of chocolates at all. for i carried with me the box...for a long time... i did not open it fearing that the sweetness of life would end. then it did. I lost the box...my sweetness..my life...  four years was my forever. and forever is gone. it was taken away from me so fast that i didnt have the chance for any reaction. days past.....nights of slumber. i hear the past echoing in my ears...like a nightmare... late at night..i often cry... like all nights..like the night before yesterday.. and the night before that.  have you seen my soul?

      i have never felt so numb in my life. as i was walking trough the grounds of a certain college... i felt this cold eery wind.. the breeze gave me a feeling of such dispair... i looked at the time.(it was 4:42) i saw this guy chasing his papers being blown away infront of me... i didnt bother to pick it up...i continued walking.. why is there a nostalgic moment... i can see a lot of sillouettes around me... lots of sounds....people walking....like a ray of light.... glares....sounds..mumblings... but as if i have my own time and space... a diffrent zone...im walking slowly... im numb... is it because of the cold cold wind??? im scared...i dont know why....i cant feel my hands...  after a while...the a cold breeze gushed in my face again... i stopped..it hurts so much... am i scared of the wind??? or the fact that i know im alone.... reality check... it is starting to sink in....

      its really funny when i post something funny on my friendster...almost everybody reacts...but when i post something sad..or real..nobody does...nobody asked meabout my realtionship...nobody had the guts... maybe they know im hurting...or they just dont wanna ask anymore becoz they respect what i feel.. so i posted this last july 6.. diko alm kung sino magbabasa nito pero wala ako  pakialam.sa mga magbabasa pa hanggang  huli...salamat.  mejo naisipan kong mag type.pag daw kasi emo  mode ka..may mga nasusulat kang maayos.  eto na emo trip n nmn ako.ayan..emo.emo dito..emo don.  astig yang musika.wala ako pakialam kung ayw ng  iba jan.sa mga hindi nakakaalam nyan, hindi yan  yung tipong ballad ng pirated cd galing  greenhills na may title na cruisin.aminin mo  meron ka din nyan.marami din kame nabentahan  nyan dati.daming orders.may mga mp3 ako  nyan.pero hindi yan yung sinasabi ko. kinda punk rock na may emosyon.hindi din yung  tipong avril ha?nakakhiya yun. alternative, yan...maganda din yan..syempre pa.  april 29 nung umalis me ng pilipinas.nakaktuwang  isipin na 2 buwan mahigit nako ditto.Sa loob ng  2 buwan at kalahati ang dami dami ng ngyari  sakin.Sa buhay ko. minsan, may mga nangyayari ng biglaan.tipong  caught unattended ka,na madalas, hindi mo nlng  pinapansin.Iiwasan mo ng iiwasan pero dadating  yung time na mag bre-breakdown knlng at iiyak  Maghapon magdamag.Masakit na yung dibdib  mo,tapos kahit uminom ka ng tubig, ayaw tumigil  yung "hik....hik.." alm ko alam nyo ibig kong  sabihin. Hirap pala pag magisa ka.Nakakinip.pero madalas,  namimiss mo mga taong bahagi ng buhay mo.Pati  yung bahay namin.Nakaktuwa nga kasi kahit  sobrang init sa mandaluyong tapos wala pang  kwarto,ok lng sakin.Sabi nga ni ivan,yun yung  pinaka masayang part ng buhay nya.ako din nmn. ayan..nagbabasa k padin. nung mga unang linggo na andito nko,i must  admit,sobrang sakit ng mga ngyayari.Kasi may mga  tanong ako na walang sagot.siguro,hindi parin  handa masagutan.Hndi nmn kasi madali lalo na  kung nahihirapan din yung tinatanong mo.Parang  exam nung college,pag hindi ko alam, pinapasa ko  na agad sa prof,akala nila ang talino ko pero  wla tlga sagot..lolz. pumunta ako d2 na ang dala ko lng ay 4 na  pants,ilang shirt,mga litrato namin,si ismeeh (doll) chaka mga bilin ng mama ko. umalis ako bitbit ang 4 na taong memories at  pangako.Hindi kame handang  maghiwalay.Nakakatakot diba? pero yun yung  ngyari.Siguro,gumagawa yung diyos ng paraan para  makita ng tao ang sarili nya.Yung mga bagay na  hindi natin alam. Maraming oras na nagtatanong ako kung bakit  ganto,bakit ganun..Walang sumasagot.wala kasi  wala nga pala ako kausap.. Tapos na ako sa pag iyak.dumating na yung stage  na nagalit ako.galit ako sayo.galit ako sa  kanya.galit ako sa kanila.galit ako sa sarili  ko.takot din pala ako magisa..Madaming tao ang  sumuporta sa akin. Madami akong naging kaibigan.madaming  nawala ,may pa send send lng ng msg na.."kaya mo  yan"..."sayang namn kayo".. pero hindi nmn tlga  concerned. Dahil nga sa naiba lahat yung plano,pati mundo  ko nag iba.Biglaan.Alam ko sa sobrang hirap nung  sitwasyon,pati sya umalis.Mahirap nmn kasi  talaga gumalaw ng magisa lalo na pag andun lahat  yung alaala.May nagsabi sakin na itapon ko daw  lahat ng gamit na magpapa-alala sakin nung  dati.Natawa ako kasi mawawala lahat ng gamit  ko.pulubi ang labas ko nun. Ngayon,hindi ko sasabihing ok nako.pero kung  iisipin naten,hindi sayang eh.walang  nasayang.Madaming magagandang bagay n ngyari,at  madami kame natutunan.Nakakamiss.alam ko  yun.lalo na yung mga kanta na post post sa board. tama si billy,baliw nlng nga makakalimot sa  ngyari samin. Siguro,meron pang dapat makita.i mean,hindi sa  ibang tao pero sa sarili.madami ang  nalungkot,madami yung nasaktan,Ako?iyak ako ng  iyak.kahit nmn sa movie naiiyak ako. Alam ko na magiging maganda ang lahat.hindi man  agad agad pero mangyayari yun.sa dami ng mga  kanta..sa dami ng movies, sa dami ng pagkain,sa  dami ng kaibigan,sa dami ng toothpaste,sa dami  ng chocolate,sa dami ng sabon at kung ano-ano pa, hindi matatabunan ng sakit o gulo yung lahat. sabi nga nila..yung forgiveness hindi para sa  tao but para sa sarili mo. chaka hindi kame mahilig sa drama.puro comedy  nga pinapanood namn dati eh. mahaba nto..may nagbabasa p kaya? kung sakali man na makasalubong nyo ako,may  hikaw nko sa ilong. ok po ba?:)     i got a msg alright...from him... i am glad...

      "im falling into...memories of you..things we used to do..follow me there..a beutiful somewhere..a place that i can share..with you...."   i was really aware of the things that happened to me before..all the memories i hold too.that makes me stronger now. i eamn whats the point being bitter and angry..we just need time to heal and be a better person by finding ourselves.  somtimes..memories gives us a beutiful smile...you'll just see urself reminising...  maybe..its all good...  i have no regrets...

      while i was browsing my friendster...like a day to day basis... i saw a message from someone really familiar. yes. i got a msg from him. it was the usual masg. funny thing isa that ..i hear his voice while i wa reaing the short msg of him. still emotionless.still hollow. i replied to the message. I was honest as i always was with him. i told him i was mad.i am. i am hurting. too much pain has endured because he never told me answers to my simple questions. i dont know why he did that. why he just ran away. he always does. he ran away from his family before... he ran away from school.. he ran away from me..and ran back to australia.  talk is cheap..you said that you will never go back there. you would stand on your own.. yuo love me..you want to get a good family.a good life...prove something.. but why do you always ran away?  it hurts me that you are like that. that you never keep your words...not to them..not even to me.  what is pride? regaining pride back is the only reason he gave me. but is what you did the solution to get the pride back? you just proved yourself that you cant stand on your decision before.  i dont know the answers really.. everybody who loved you..every body who beleived and supported you... you just turned them down. without saying a word. without being a man. its not about money. its not how good your job is.. its about your word. what you said before..about showing and proving your family that you can make it on your own is gone.   only you know the answer. so if pride is what ur trying to gain back.. you were 1 step close on getting it and proving it by standing on your word and fighting for the person or your future "family", but all yuodid is throw it all away and lose all the people who gave you support and loved you like a family. mga lola, mga tita, kaibigan, lahat lahat na naniwala sayo, binigo mo lahat para lng sa sarili mo.   parang sinabi mop na rin na " hindi ko pala kaya... sige, kayo na bahala..."  hindi habang panahon...tatakasn natin mga responsibilities natin... mga decisions...  masakit magmahal ng taong hindi mo alam kung totoo. kung andun lng sya dahil wala sya kasama. mahal pa rin kita. yoko ng ganto. ayoko ng mahal pa rin kita kahit sobrang sakit. kahit hindi ko alm kung totoo lahat. dahil hindi mo masabi..hindi mo masagot mga tanong ko ngayon...kung kailan ako ang humihingi ng konting panahon mo para sumagot.Maliit na bagay lng ang hinihingi ko.... yun lng.malaman ko lng.

      Every time I hear a certain song… there is always…always a memory that comes with it. Just now, I listened to an eraserheads song. Funny how I was taken back in time. Back a couple of years ago. back in my college days. When everything was easy. everything was simple and friendship is sealed with laughter and a bottle of beer.  My college days were the best moments of my life. I have met all the people who touched and continue to touch my life until now. I have stumbled and fall. I had my ups and downs. met the people whom I loved. Those were the times that I made decisions that changed my life forever.  The path was never easy though, Lots of times I have cried too. But definitely with the people I really am close too. Living in the same house, sharing everything, may it be problems about school, about love, about life, about money. About family.  How I wish I could go back to the times when we will drive late at night to the grounds of UP sunken garden and just talk. I want to go back to the times I just sleep and have someone to embrace every time I am scared. I want to go back to the times when I was not hurt. When I was not alone. When I was not crying. When I was not feeling this shit.   Last year, I know that me, leaving the country was inevitable. So was scared to death for me finishing college. Not now. Not now that I am completely happy with my life. I know everything will change once I leave the country. And why am i stil shattered even though something inevitable will happen. I cant stop it.I know this years ago.   I miss my life so much. I miss the old me. I still am not complete. I can’t let go of my past. Its haunting me like d devil. It is so hard letting go.  I am not ready to leave my past and it is starting to give me too much pain. Damn. I hate it. I hate what I feel.
