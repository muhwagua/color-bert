      This is where I inform the web, which is the world, about where I've been published recently and my writing projects.  I also include dates and addresses where I'll be reading, which is usually in NYC.

      Mmmm.  Finished the interview with the fabulous  Drama Queens,  the all-female drag queen troupe of three lovely and extremely interesting ladies.  They really enjoy fucking with people's ideas about gender; since they are often mistaken for male drag queens.  I think the most powerful thing I got out of the meeting was learning that being a drag queen of either gender means busting loose, going to the extreme, becoming the fashion whore/drama queen/slut that you always wanted to be but were frightened away by good taste or public opinion.  I hope everyone will read the article once it comes out!

      I think I broke my toe Saturday.  It was really hurting, but now it's just numb and an awful lot of odd colors.  I can't afford to get gangrene now.  No health insurance as of Friday.   Daddy   He is everywhere, effusive, the airbag in the Volvo exploding during the crash, suffocating me, snapping my neck in the guise of rescue.

      And I'm working on a poem that might be okay.    8 days till parents visit.  I'm not freaking out yet.  Yes I am.  No I'm not. Yes.. No.. (Bad comedy hijinks ensue.) I had a good date yesterday.  Which I'm bursting to describe in all its tawdry (not at all: sorry, put it back in your pants) glory.  But I won't, this being a public forum and... Okay, I'm scared  he  might read it and a girl has to preserve some mystery, doesn't she?  At least that's what people tell me.  It's hard enough having my poetry about sex in the elelevator out there for everyone to read and make solo love to.  Tonight I interview a gaggle of female drag queens for Wide Angle.  My first interview ever.  I'm terrified. a little.

      So. Friday was my last day at my old job.  Various responses from co-workers saying goodbye.  Some picked fights, some said stay in touch, others threw hissy-fits and ran out of the room.  The director asked me, before I left, if I would come back for one day and work for free. Ahem. Right.   I hate leaving.  Anything at all ever.  That's why I keep staying in relationships that suck (tm).   I got so depressed leaving that place that I could barely drag myself out of bed in the morning.  I just wanted to stay home curled in the fetal position.  And of course they took it personally when I came in late.  Which made me feel worse.  Self defeating, anyone?  In the category of  good  news: I got a notice threatening eviction!  Maybe  urlLink Andy  and I can be homeless together.  Our creased and filthy cardboard sign will say WILL RighT fer FooD

      My reading on the 15th of May is at The Charleston in Williamsburg.  It's a funky old bar, last time I went it was full to the brim with hipsters.  I hope to have some new stuff to read then. Last night I finally submitted my review of a friend's book to Pemmican.  She's such a better writer than me. Must kill her.  Today is my second to last day at my current job. Arghh.  I hate goodbyes.

      Future things.  My parents are coming! (Picture Paul Revere, a galloping horse, a cold New England night, etc.) They are due to arrive on May 7th.  That would make today, day 17 of the countdown.  They're only here for a week.  I can survive. (chant softly to self, ad infinitum).  Oh, the nightmares have begun already.  I won't describe them, as some of you might be smart enough to figure out what they mean.    I have been invited to read during a band's regular night, Wednesday, May 15th, at some bar in Williamsburg.  Of course, it would help if I could remember the name of the bar. By then, I will have started my new job as clinical director of a mental health site in the heart of Bed Stye.  My current co-workers predict I won't last a week.  I'll show them.  I'll last a week and a half.  Just because I'm white, people think I'm whimpy.  This is not true.  I'm white AND whimpy, but the two are not necessarily related.    On May 17th, my friend's boyfriend is accompanying Rod McKuen as he sings. This is somewhere in the city. I promised to come.  I'll try not to giggle if Rod goes into "Listen to the Warmth" mode.  On May 21st, Sharon Olds is reading at the Barnes and not-entirely-noble at Union Square.  I'll have to move therapy.  But: my therapist loves Sharon Olds as well, so maybe we can just go together. hah.  I need a  urlLink date.  Or  maybe just another cat.  I can't decide.

      Oh look.  The poem below went away.  It was making my eyes bleed!  I didn't like it!  Not ready for prime time.  However, I did get an old piece, Science gone Mad, accepted by Wicked Alice. Opium said they liked the piece I submitted, but that it needed a bit more meat.  Whatever.  I'll try to add some substance.  But I have none!  I have two interviews to do for Wide Angle.  One's of the man-poet I worship, Todd Colby, and the other's of the head of an all female drag queen troupe. I like genderplay, so that should be interesting.  Hmm.  I got a new tv.  And I discovered.  TV sucks.

Just last summer, I was giving my paintings away for free at the art festival.  And still people wouldn't take them.  Now people pay money, hah!  and I wrote a new poem.  I attempted to do it in third person, and not use the word cunt.  This is the phirst drapht.   First draft!

      I've been thinking about my voice lately.  No, not the meek, girly, unmistakeably "blonde" one, but my poetic voice.  People keep saying my poetry reminds them of Buwkoski and I finally came across one of his poems today.  Before, I only knew him by reputation, hard drinking and swearing, tuff-living and people hating. I also got a general impression of decay, dirt and unhappiness.  But today I saw how he spoke about misery in such a deadpan, plain way.  Put Wordsworth to shame.  Is it "beauty is truth" or "truth is beauty"?  I forget.  But his truth is ugly.  I believe his use of non-poetic language, images and metaphors influenced a generation of poets, and they in turn influenced me.  Kathy Acker, Tricia Warden, Daphne Gottlieb and Karen Finley -- yeah, she's a writer, what, you didn't know?-- all seem to be speaking with their cunts.  And I go for that blood thirsty language.  Sharon Olds, the goddess mother of the new wave of female poets, speaks with every part of her body.  Today, my tv was broken so I was forced to think.  I thought about who is this Christine who is writing?  Where did she come from?  So I started to list influences.  Besides those above, there's Sapphire, Lawrence Raab, James Tate, Wallace Stevens, and comic book women, Love and Rockets, Dame Darcy, Julie Doucet, and rockers, Courtney Love, Rasputina, NIN.  And then there's the personal influences, Douglas Wolk, a writer for the Voice, who showed me in two dates (which I'm sure he doesn't remember, they were years ago) that writing for a living is not so impossible, and that you don't have to be a genius.  Not that he's not smart.  Kiki Smith, raises the body and its fluids/processess to a new form of childlike fairytale, mytho-poetic and pre-pubescent at the same time.  I need to sleep.  I was going to include links to everyone and thing.  Maybe tomorrow.  They made me "Literary" not just "poetry" editor for Wide Angle.  So I get to pick both the fiction and the poetry.  I'm hoping to get some really good stuff.  Later.

      New book!  Or a near facismle thereof.  So many people were asking me if I had a book to buy at the Thesauraushead reading that I stapled and copied and photoshopped (yes, I'm using photoshop as a verb, so sue me -- ha! watch it will really happen) and put together copies over the weekend.  Unfortunately, I didn't stop to eat or move from my chair, so I got really sick.  But I sold my first copy, and hope to sell the rest tomorrow at the reading.  Although they tend not to buy at these Women's Center Readings -- I've tried it before.  If you want a copy, email me at bronzelizard@cs.com.  They're five dollars and you flatter me a lot, cheaper.  For a look at the cover, go urlLink  here.

      What Stirring had to say about my poem:  Congratulations.  The editors have decided on your piece, "Things that are Left at K-mart, According my Dream on Wednesday," one of the finest pieces of poems we've come across in a while, for our upcoming edition of Stirring.  They had the following to say about your work --  "This poem just SHOULD NOT work. But it does."  "I'm not usually one for list poems, but this one captured my attention and held it throughout the read. Each word really makes you stop and think and consider its significance both singly and in relation to the whole. I particularly liked the repetition of 'the torso of a woman' which gets richer with each repeat. And, of course, the title really makes the piece. Very imaginative and unusual. "  "Enigmatic, took up speed and strength toward the end."

      Two thumbs up, two thumbs down.  Boss when he's happy -- boss when he's sad.    Sarah Lawrence Reading -- eech.  I nearly got frostbite from my reception.  The people I invited were very nice, and I hope not just because of the free champagne, but no one else spoke to me, and I felt very, well, univited.    Thesaurushead Reading -- yum.  Everyone was incredibly nice and friendly, and the actual stuff read was better.  The ratio of pretention to talent was infinitely lower.

      I'm also a member of the  urlLink Women's Studio Center,  which is based in Astoria, although now we rent studio space in Long Island City for meetings and workshops.  Women from all over the city are welcome to join.  I'm on the literary steering committee for the center, and a member of the visual arts component as well.  I'm going to be teaching a poetry class through them in fall.   The monthly workshops are great!  Free to all women writers, although we encourage people to join.  Only members can be included in the readings and special events, etc.  It costs like 40 dollars a year to join. And the wonder queen diva guru glamor genius of the writing section of the Women's Studio Center is Anne Babson.  She's very famous and a good poet.  You can see some of her work at urlLink  www.pemmicanpress.com.   Also  a fawning review, which I wrote.

       «  urlLink nyc bloggers map  » Since I've joined the N train bloggers clique with the promise that I have local connections to Astoria, I will expound apon these.  Mickey Z. is one fantastic counter culture guy.  He lives somewhere around the 30th Ave. stop.  He has a book, Saving Private Power, a really interesting examination of American propaganda surronding WWII, for sale at www.softskull.com.  He's also publishing  a new book, The Murdering of Our Years, about artists and their horrible day jobs, which will hopefully include an essay I submitted.  I'm also working on the illustrations for a children's book he wrote and is planning to have published by Seaburn Publishing, if all goes well.  Seaburn is a small publishing house based in Astoria.  Last but not least, Mickey is my uber editor at Wide Angle, a local art and culture magazine which is due to launch in July.  I am Wide Angle's literary editor and ocassional freelance writer.  Aki, who runs the funky Sofa Cafe on Newtown Ave and 34th Street ( I think!  At least it's close to there, right behind the Rite Aid on 30th Ave), is a great supporter of the arts.  He hangs artwork by local artists and has open mic readings as well.  He's also the publisher of Wide Angle.

      I'm not a pretty girl. I'm past my prime. I have a mustache. I slouch. My wieght hangs at my stomach-- I continually look like I'm in the fourth month of a difficult pregnancy. My skin is pallid and blotchy. My face is puffy and irregular. I walk hunched over, bouncing up and down, with peculiar cant to the left. My hair is greasy and unkempt, and not in that cool, bedhead way of Meg Ryan. My teeth are uneven and biege. I tend to smell of old crab. I don't make eye contact. My voice is reminsicent of Minnie Mouse. But still, every time I look in the mirror, I find it hard not to fall in love.

      Had a wonderful reading experience tonight, as the opening act for the Funkiest Band in the World (hereafter, FBW)  Ladies' Choice .  I read some of my new stuff from the past couple weeks.  See below for samples.  Very small, but appreciative audience.  Mr. Kevin Kearse, the drummer and founder of the band, introduced me as the punk queen of the world, and repeated at least twice that I really had balls.  I think both were meant as compliments.  FYI, I don't  really  have balls.  But I understand the sentiment.   Ladies' Choice  plays every third Saturday at the Charleston in Williamsburg.  They are soo much fun to watch, and not just because they're pretty young things, but also because they really enjoy what they're doing.  I've never seen so many spontaneous smiles in a band.  I also had a interesting conversation with Lana (I hope that's right) and Jose after the performance.  They both work in the film industry, and made it sound  quite degrading, so I wasn't too jealous.  Work is... well, everyone hates me already.  They're having meetings to discuss what I do wrong.  No pressure though.  Snort.  Bite me. What can I say.  As all my friends predicted, "Christine, you will never find a job that you like."    The Drama Queens article is almost done.  It's sort of dragging.  I'd love to start the Todd Colby one, however, before you get to B) you must pass through A).  Ouch head.  I should never drink.  Especially BEFORE i read, as it tends to make me mispronounce words.  Although I'm a friendly drunk.

       Doll Descending a Staircase   I am the dressmaker’s daughter. He hates sewing but he knows nothing else. He kneels at women’s feet all day while their faces tell him his touch doesn’t matter.  I am the dressmaker’s dummy. I can fit any dress size. His touch doesn’t matter. He is my father.  I don’t need a head or feet or arms. I am the dressmaker’s daughter.  The pins leave a tattoo of scars. He reads them to me at night. I smell like cotton padding and rust. These pins are pearls.  I’ve worn 16 wedding dresses. My hair is made of lace. My nails have been replaced by springs. All day I hear the whirring of tiny gears. Tiny girls circle my head, which I don’t need.  Underneath my skirt, there’s an automitizer full of gasoline. I am dangerous around small fires.  I am a machine  made of rubber bands, ear wax and muzak. I run on hot air. When I hold my breath, I hardly bleed. These pins do not pop me like a balloon made of wax or songs. His slacks are striped taffeta.  I am the dressmaker or his daughter.

      If capitalism really wanted to sell sexuality, it would have to have a talking head of someone saying, "Sometimes nothing gets me off at all, so I could hardly give a shit about this perfume or that car. In fact, I'm more interested in breaking things, and treating the people I love badly. Sometimes it's just like this, and nothing helps for a while." Then the General Motors logo underneath. It would be a rare example of credibility in advertising.  -- Rick Moody

I think I've achieved a sort of distance; I just laugh at them instead of getting stressed out.  They bicker constantly.  It's cute, in a Simpsons' kind of way.  I gave them my new painting (see below) as a present, and I think they sort of liked it, though they didn't get the collage concept.  They kept saying, it's made of all different bits of paper -- it's broken.

      Some people derive great pleasure from pretending to be shocked when they are not.  YOU know who you are.   Job is so splendiferiously wonderful.  Omigod.  Power.  Respect.  and getting to play on the floor with crayons.  It doesn't get any better than this.  I counselled my first two children today, ever, and it was a resounding success therapeutically, although my office will never recover, and the foster mother is peeved that I didn't recommend medication so she can manage them more easily, along with the other four kids she has who obey like sheep.  Okay, so a few things are frustrating.  Like the fact that nobody understands that children up to about ten benefit most from play therapy.  They want me to lay the kids down on the couch, smoke the Freudian pipe, and psychoanalyze them. Yeah.  At that age, they have a heard time distinguishing between dreams and reality.  There's not much of an unconscious to uncover.  It's more about building up and integrating and naming, not uncovering.  Anyway, I made a drawing of a space ship, and the kid made a jelly fish to go inside it.  This made me happy.  Until someone tried to staple me to death.  Luckily I was able to substitute the stapler with a crocodile.

       Multiple Choice   Please answer the following four questions.  For each question, you will be given an incomplete statement followed by four possible endings.  Think constantly of things that are pink.  Please choose the ending that corresponds closest to the corrrect meaning.  Some endings may  appear  to be correct, but only one is the right answer.    Put your pencils down. I'm the only writer in this room.  1.  A poem is:               a) Elvis               b) I'll give you something to cry about               c) hitting your thumb with a hammer               d) a wet kiss from a woman with loose dentures               e) the way the skirt of a girl moves around her thighs                   as she climbs the stairs ahead of you                 f) the image of your hand, there       2.  On any given day, there are:                a) a bucket                b) pins in the corner of her mouth                c) what exactly does this have to do with the previous question?                d) a cloud that reminds you of a dream you had once, but                     you can't remember, it's all just a series of images and the                     images themselves are a blur.  Or maybe that wasn't a dream.                    Maybe it actually happened.    Sorry.  I can't be anymore specific.                    But anyway, you were saying?  3. Subject and object confusion are often a sign of:                    a) love                    b) you're a woman                    c) hitting your thumb with a hammer                    d) your woman is a small machine                    e) You're kidding. And what did  she  say?

      Okay.  I'm over it. I've recovered.  I spent all day working on a painting, and that helped me through it.  It's a self-portrait, and it turned out really well.  Me with a halo. hehe. So accurate.  Eek.  I only have Sunday between me and the new job, and my article about the drama queens is due next week.  And I'm seeing the rental units on Wed.  Working on a poem.  Maybe I'll post it.

      You know, when a guy compliments you, tells you you're different from other women, extends the date late into the night, starts telling you personal stuff, wants a third date after you say you'd like more kissing, YOU TEND TO THINK HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU, DON'T YOU?    Unless this person turns out to be a psycho who probably needs to wreak vengenance on female kind and tells you right before your train comes that he never wants to see you again and that he feels nothing for you.  Perhaps to see the look on your face.    Boy do men suck.

      A poet I read recently wrote: a poem is a small machine made of God.    I want to write about pieces of god in my poems, but god isn't the right word exactly.  Perhaps I mean a piece of the whole.  Buddhism is harder to wrap up in neat words like "god".

      The mostest offensive.  Warning: contains the line "buttfucked by Jesus till come spews out my mouth"   Fuck Everything   Freud's right -- it IS all about sex. But not in that sad, dark little way he talked about, with word games and parlor tricks, as if our body were sitting across from us  in a poker game and always bluffing, until we just wanted to throw our cards down and leave but by then it was too late  and we were strapped to a wheelchair --  Everything is about sex. Not just sex, but fucking.  Not just between men and women or women and women,  or children and pets, but everything.  When I touch a book it opens for me and I get wet. Breath enters me like God's cock. I slide into my clothes and they hold me. My shoes caress the sidewalk and it buckles in pleasure.  I want to squat over the earth and mount it, ride it, until I'm so big and wet I can fit it inside me and scream like I'm being fisted by the Angel Gabriel, like I'm being butt-fucked by Jesus till come spews out my mouth.  Every skin cell every murmur of my heart every millimeter of naked blue vein fucks the world and the world fucks me back.

      I just had to get these poems out of the way before I could sleep.  They're offensive.  Very. Extremely.  If you're offended. Write me a comment. Sorry.  Shield your eyes.  Look, away, children, look away.   Mother's Day   not terribly offensive, this one   I guess I get a little angry around Mother's day.  Always trying to make  the right mother, the right mother's  day gift.  Always trying to write for mother, always trying to be right for mother, always trying to write "Mother" after she has fallen down.  Fallen down into the ground where someone wrote "mother" on the stone.  Leave no stone unturned looking for Mother. The right mother. The gift.  _____________  And yet more offensive:   Confessions of a Sex Addict   Okay I admit: Yesterday, I had two. Two, two times each. And the day before that six. Divided by... I'm not sure how many. Three I think.  Then it starts multiplying exponentially. A cell dividing,  a spongy octagon gaining sides, planes, dimensions until it mushrooms.  Blooms into sight -- the melting tip of the iceberg, spilling off a cock, any cock really, or every cock (There's such a thing as the everyman, isn't there) so this is the everycock, just your ordinary average joe cock, except multiply that by fifty and you'd have my week, or the start of my week -- this bouquet of dicks flowering with sperm, their throbbing, sweet little heads pink hearts upside down.  It's the numbers that get me off. 1 a day plus iron. 2 a day keeps the doctor away. 3 a day and I'm too sore to sit but I'm happy happy happy happy happy happy.  __________  And stretches the bounds of good taste and sense further:   My TV   My TV is not only my best friend, it's my lover. I stick my fingers into the electronic goo that lubricates the wires and plugs and chips and gears and I moan with the mutual excitement of it, Like I'm sticking my tongue in my girlfriend's cunt or my thumb up my boyfriend's ass. Getting "in" to a body is such a turn-on for me I start shaking. My pussy swells until my lips are like cantalope halves between my legs.  My TV used to do that to me, when I could tell it was really excited, when I put away the remote and got up close and personal.  It would start winking its screen at me. Sparks flew. Fireworks. We understood each other, my TV and me.  I would run my tongue over its attenae  and go down on it, The channels switching spontaneously.   We had chemistry.  But then the VCR came and things got complicated.

      Oh my fricking god, this is so fricking...  urlLink fricking.     Interviewed Mr. Todd Colby this evening.  He enlightened me so much I thought the top of my head was going to lift off as my brain burst into light.  It's wonderful to have encounters with geniuses (of the species: genus) -- they enrich my world and I try very hard not to feel smaller in comparision.  As I found out through the boy-of-two-possibly-three-dates,  urlLink this  guy has a tattoo parlor in my building.  So now I can just trot on down the stairs, knock on his door, and ask to borrow some sugar, and a little pain and ink.  I've been thinking about sending in a couple poems to  urlLink here,  hoping they might make the yearly datebook.  I have some favorites I'd like to try, but damn those copyright laws, they've already been published.

I've discovered a very good poet: Debra Wienstein.  Everyone should read "Rodent Angel."  Although it has the ugliest cover ever.

      But what was very specially interesting about the reading tonight, besides making me feel all warm and gooey and loved   and besides reading outside and having a halo of fireflies the whole time (which I was unaware of and only told about after the fact) was that the poem that was  best  received was the one I wrote  today during lunch .  I was struggling with "The Anatomy of Distance" (see below) because I wasn't really pleased with it.  It was a nice idea, and had some nice images, but I felt that I kept circling around something that I was trying to say and never quite getting to it.  I've been thinking about how my poetry seems to fall into two categories, pretty or ugly.  I think the best way to put it is: the raw and the cooked.  Okay, I know the title is taken.   The cooked: more about language and image and some other post modern gender stuff, usually.  The raw: drugs, sex, pain, love.   Maybe if I were a really good poet I could actually combine the two.  But the stuff people really seem to love is the raw stuff. After a reading,  I've heard the response at least 6 times, "you really tell it like it is," or "you say what every one thinks but is afraid to put into words."  The poem I wrote today was what came out when I asked myself, what do I really want to say but am afraid to?   So what came out was pretty ugly.  It exposed a part of me that I'm not proud of.   It basically said a lot of things that frat boys say, and if I were a man and I said those things about any woman or showed that attitude, they would have killed me. I would have been stoned.  It would have been biblical.     But since Iyam what iyam, all the women in the audience were giving me the high five, talking about empowerment and role-reversal, etc.    I'm thinking of changing the title of this piece to either,  I'm a pig , or  Hi, I'm Christine, and I Celebrate Female Sexuality .  That last one would be pretty funny.  I feel like introducing myself that way at my next reading, and keeping a totally straight face.    Oh, oh, I almost forgot: what was so precious about tonight was that I dressed totally straight, in fact, beyond straight, I put on my  Amish-wear  dress from my previous job at a church and wore mary janes.  They were so surprised at the stuff coming out of my mouth...!

       Blake Nelson sucks!  Yes, that is the heading of this little rant/celebration. Who, you may ask, is this "Blake Nelson?"  He is a semi-famous writer of adolescent trashy books who once met me through the on-line personals. He was tremendously snotty and secretive about being a writer, and then he basically ran out of the coffee shop after 15 minutes.  Again, just as with  Jerome Baker the violin maker , I had to question whether or not am I just a horrible ugly person that brings out the worst in men.  Of course, all this happened with Mr. Nelson about three years ago.  Why, you may ask, am I bringing it up now?     Because Blake managed to make me feel like an ass tonight without even trying.  Without even being there.  One of the people hosting the wonderful reading at  The Read  was talking about well-known writers from Portland, and mentioned that  Blake Nelson  might be dropping by during the night.  I screamed, Oh NO! before clapping my hand over my mouth.  Of course it turns out that he's friends with this host.  I tried to explain, "uh, awkward blind date," but I don't think I was understood.  Everyone just thought I was a spaz. Me, a spaz!  How could that be?

       Plus,  I wrote a new poem.  It has no obscenities, which makes me nervous.  I always worry that I'm not gritty enough if I don't use some nice four-letter words.  Didn't  Queen   make a song about that?  "Four-letter words you make the rocking world go round!"   Here it is:   The Anatomy of Distance    Picture an oil painting  In the Medical Academy  by a Dutch master in 1641. The walls are in shadow,  appear to be black. Our walls are blue.   I. The Doctors:  In the auditorium, in our room,  spectators surround the body. One touches it and looks at us. He doesn't mean to touch the body in a way that has any kindness in it, As your fingers attempt to sign nothing with their grasp, but his hands are as gentle as the soft astonished faces of the men staring at us as we stare at them.   II. The Body:  The body does not appear to be sleeping but dead. Not just the pallor but the lack of eyelashes. The upper lip curls  in ecstasy or disdain. Although the kidneys vena cava intestines splay into our faces, point to the sky and our eyes, the body is the only one  who escapes  in this picture. The one truly alone and hidden.  As you  and I are hidden  from each other by our bodies, the deeper we thrust our cutting fondling instruments the farther we float away like unmoored boats. Until we lie  next to one another on the same bed in different rooms the same color as  the inside of an eyelid or eggshell, the same color blue.

      I feel on a more even keel today.  So my boss is lying psycho.  I still have to kiss his ass for a paycheck.  I'm used to psychos; I know how to get on their good sides.  I almost lost it today when he accused me of having a narcisstic personality disorder because I asked, in a completely neutral tone, if my computer (which he's been promising me for the last six weeks) was in that big box in the corner.  I have no idea why asking if the 'puter was in the box was narcisstic.  But then I remembered that he's narcissitic, so I wasn't so bothered.  His new method of complimenting me is by saying, "finally, you're wising up."  Passive aggressive loser.  But on to much more exciting news: I made some collages and pictures! Yes, yes, the thrill.  I'm also trying out two new covers for my poetry book-in-progress, Pavlov Made My Mother Cry.  Here,  urlLink yes  are the draft covers and new photo of the collage assemblage.

      More short storey-ish:   The Curse  At 14, I am visited by strange green flies and visions of the virgin.  She is out of focus.  Her hair appears to be pink.  She speaks only in Greek.  When I shake my head because I don't understand, she gives me the finger.  My sisters pinch me and talk about fixations on Britney Spears.    Each night the moon is full.  The flies avoid the TV, but cling to the mirrors.  My sisters swat at them and glare.  Sometimes I look at myself in old photos late into the night.  I was different then, before I was called.  Since then I have shaved my head and sleep on the floor.  I only bathe in fat-free milk.   Still, the virgin torments me.  Her sarcasm is enormous.  My dreams are filled with blocks of color.  Sometimes I dream with my eyes open.  The teachers in school resent this.  My mother can do nothing with me.  My sisters tie my hands behind my back and leave me in a closet for days.  The virgin persists.  I begin to think the Virgin resides in one of my bicuspids, and I attempt to remove it.  My father offers me his pliers.  They bury me at sunset next to my grandmother.  Purple roses spring spontaneously from my grave.  During the wake, the virgin appears and hovers over the TV set.  She points to my youngest sister.  The others move their chairs away from her.  She pisses herself.

      Short story like:   Woman in Search of her Sex    She became obsessed with getting water into her body.  She took two hour baths followed by hour long handstands.  Her bookcases were filled with enemas and douches.  They were arranged according to color and scent.  She drank ten gallons of Poland Spring a day. Her kidneys hibernated and had nightmares.  She put a funnel in her ear and poured in rose water.  She stuck her face into a sinkful of water and inhaled.  She became more and more pale and indistinct. When she opened her mouth to speak, one could hear the faint crash of waves in the background.  Her belly murmured with the lonely sonar calls of whales.  Her skin became scaly.  Her hair started to fall out.  Her eyes became huge and stopped focusing on anything.  She stopped saying hello to the women in the apartment next door when she got her mail.  She stopped getting her mail.  She cut herself shaving and something vaguely orange oozed out.  Her toenails dropped off.   A huge fish tank, fishless, but full sat in the middle of her bedroom. At night, her neighbors in the building across from hers could see her face illuminated by the fish tank glow.  She gestured and spoke eloquently to no one.  The neighbors called the cops.  The cops took her away.   The apartment stood empty for two years. Mold creeped into huge snow flake shapes along the windowsills.  Then the neighbors saw the woman again, at night.  She had grown enormous.  She was shiney and naked at all times. She let her breasts rub against the glass as she painted the window panes black.    The neighbors called the cops.  The cops went into the apartment and disappeared.  The neighbors called more cops.  More cops came.  There was an accident.  The building was burned to the ground.  The smell of burnt fish for days.   The neighbors moved away.  They moved to the ocean.  They were visited by odd spells of melancholia and nose bleeds.  They regreted the city.  They were all eventually lost at sea.

        Carol Lay is amusing.  This piece is called  The persistance of Kat Klocks .  I just added my  urlLink Amazon Wishlist.  Buy me something and I'll write you a poem. heh.  I wrote two short stories this weekend.  This is extraordinary.  I never write fiction.  But then again, these might be poems in disguise.  I will post them soon.  I came across a sentence at the Spark.com that made me giggle: "We live in an appalling, backwards world in which, everyday, college students learn with greater skill how to spell the word misogyny and accuse each other of being sexist."

      Today I went to my first live drawing class at the women's studio center.  I've been planning to go for about 6 months, but I just keep cancelling at the last minute.  One reason is that it's SO early in the morning!  11AM!  Also, I sometimes just get this wierd social anxiety any time I attempt to try something new.  It was fantastic!  Such good practice.  Of course, everybody else was a much better artist than me, at least in that they had a basic grasp of anatomy, which I don't, I admit.  All my people look like distorted stick figures with pot bellies.  Probably has something to do with the way I perceive people.   In my world, you're all distorted stick figures!  Aagh!!  Don't talk to me.  Anyway, I met the coolest girl, OlgaTuimil, who was there for the first time and is an incredible artist.  Of course she had to sit next to me so I could see her work and get jealous.  No stick figures for her.  But she did loan me her crayon.  That's not to be scoffed at.

      I tweaked the  Political Fiction  piece below and sent it into a site that asked for political fiction.  The rejection slip made me giggle.    Christine,  Thank you for submitting, but this is not what we are looking for.  Our fiction for the most part will be solicited work from writers we know or admire, but that's not to say that we won't publish unsolicited work.  However, in our fiction we are looking for much longer, more traditional narratives that have a story, a point, and characters, and through these reflect the politics of the time.  Unfortunately, your piece did not seem to have any of these elements.   I wanted to write back and say, duh, my point was that narrative itself is a form of political oppression, but it hardly seems worth the while. Anyway, I thought Betty the lobster was a character.  Also, they  had  sent me a request for a submission.

      I had a disgusting relapse into consumerism yesterday, and like all addicts, I'm revelling in the insane depths of my fixation.  The funky toys from www.spookyland.com, the alternate comix without rival in the art department. I got the MOST fantistic graphic novel, Wthe Whore, turns out it's a translation from German, although the awkward, found poetry of the spare narration could be taken for deliberate surrealism by an English writer.  The pictures are fantastic, none of the usual comic book slickness, just penciled drawings with the deliberation of a psychotically lonely teenage girl.  Uggh.  I just realized the lobster story below is pretty much a bad summary of "Lost in the Funhouse" by Barth.

       Political Fiction   I'm trying to write a fiction piece about politics, even though I usually write poetry about sex. Sex political? Well, there's the missionary position, the patriarchy and the appalling lack of lobster bibs. Maybe that last bit isn't so clear. But it's plenty clear for crustaceans.  How, you may ask, are the political aspects of sex expressed through members of the Palinuridae family? Think about it.  Think about being unassuming and unaware, just slowly scrambling along in a cloud of sand, that floating sand that smells so sweetly of decayed fish, when suddenly! bam! The trap, the net, the claw. Like your world just convulsed. An out of control dilatation, expansion, convulsion...tremor. And then you wake up in a glass cage with hundreds of others just like you, but your claws are bound with this ugly yellow tape, this tacky engagement ring, these uneven botox injections in your upper lip.   It's impossible to smile. Your attenna have been trimmed and permed. Your tan's fading fast.  It's not so much orgasm that puts you here as the double headed devil lizard of romance and The Disney. As The Disney has taught you since you opened your little blue kitten-eyes and learned to focus, romance is the blatant, secret key to what passes as life, passing.  Pairing off into the money colored tunnel of love is what you were hatched for, your barbie tells you, your pink knitted baby bonnet tells you, the cute frills in your braids tell you, all while your mother, that TV, tells you just how to trap the man of your dreams. But in your dreams it's you who's trapped. In some smelly lobster trap in some smelly harbor off the Isle of Mann, and what does romance have to with lobsters, really? And how is this a work of fiction when fiction is supposed to go like this    and this piece of writing is going like this: blah, blah, lobsters, blah, blah, blah. Where's the conflict? More importantly, where's the heroine? Let's say the lobster, Betty, is the protagonist, what is she doing right now, holding absolutely still at the bottom of a pile of 25 lobsters, or scrabbling against the glass walls of the tank at the top? And who really cares what a lobster named Betty is doing, what kind of name is Betty for a lobster anyway? Where is she, exactly, really, not hypothetically -- there's a sinking feeling that Betty's just shards of buttered flesh being cleaned from a tablecloth by a waiter stiffed on his tip.   Where is this story going? Who's narrating it? hello? Is there anyone out there? Who's in charge? Is this going to go and on, ad naseum, etc., etc. -- is it ever going to end?   And what's so political about lobsters and romance, is this some kind of a joke?  Some kind of  IRONY ?

      I am going to a poetry reading tomorrow, Sunday, given by the head of the Women's Studio Center, Anne Babson, who is also the best poet in the northern hemisphere.    Here's the deets from her:   The Back Fence, that venerable (aging hippie) institution where Bob Dylan first performed and they haven't swept the floor since has a Sunday afternoon poetry reading series with two featured poets and an almost unbearably bad open mic afterwards.  This Sunday, June 9th, at 3:30 p.m., I will be one of two featured readers.  The other reader is fabulous.  His name is Bakar Wilson.  He is an African American poet from Tennessee who writes interesting work on sexual identity issues and kind of turns Langston Hughes on his ear.  It's an honor to read with him, even in such a dump.  Drinks are cheap.  Peanuts, of which people throw the shells on the floor, are free.  There is no cover charge.  You would have to laugh if they asked you for one.  Come slum.  Be part of the magic.    If you are a poet, however amateurish you may be, spiff up the open mic and read a couple of your works.  Believe me, there is no way you could possibly fail to outshine the regulars.  WHO: Anne Babson, Bakar Wilson and the open mic folks WHAT: A poetry reading for the ages WHERE: The Back Fence, Corner of Bleeker and Thompson in the Village. WHEN: This Sunday, 3:30 p.m. WHY: Because you haven't lost your sense of humor.  I couldn't say it any better myself.  I might be reading some new stuff at the open mic.  We'll see.

      I injured the ego of the therapist I supervise on Wednesday.  The thing is; I know she's not really a therapist.  She doesn't do therapy, more a form of behavior management.  So we clash a lot.  I try to get her to see things pyscho-analytically and psychodynamically, but she really doesn't like to question why the children do the things they do.  Her reasoning is, "they're just lazy," or "they just want to do what they want to do."  She's not interested in helping the kids with deep structural change.  So I got sort of pushy when she was telling me about a case where a 13 year-old girl was kicked out of a foster home for having boys over when the foster mother wasn't around.  The therapist was really mad at the child and wanted to talk to her about deserving what she got.  I suggested rather strongely that she try to be on the side of the child, as the child was probbably feeling rejected and alone.  This REALLY pissed her off.  To try to realign my self with the THERAPIST, because I knew our relationship had suffered, I apologized the next day.  But she's still very angry at me, and now she's telling me what to do.  There's nothing that gets me faster than people who are not my boss telling me what to do.  So I'm angry.

      Sorry I don't have any exciting psychological drama.  I'm feeling pretty calm and in control.  I AM as usual obsessing over tiny slights.  A friend told me I must have OCD because I keep going over and over tiny words or phrases that people said to me, thinking what did that mean?  and how am I going to respond next time I see them?  generally getting more and more angry and upset.  Not very buddhist-like of me.

      The job interview on Friday went okay.  The woman who interviewed me was hard to read.  Although I did notice that when she was showing me the building other employees seemed to cringe in fear when she walked by.  Also that as she said good morning to every one she checked her watch to see what time they were getting in.  Not terrible good signs, those.

It's for those whose jeans are so baggy you can read the tommy label on their boxers, whose t-shirts are so loose they can fit themselves and two friends in, and who have broken so many bones skating they've lost count.

      More Evidence that People Visit My Apartment While I'm at Work  1. One extra dirty fork in the sink. 2. Cats have moved from the positions they were in when I left. 3. Toilet not flushed. 4. Inflatable bed is slightly deflated. 5. Water is dripping from bathroom faucet. 6. Bedroom door not completely closed. 7. Airconditioner is on. 8. NYtimes Book review is on LEFT front side of couch, when I left it on the RIGHT front side. 9. Light in bathroom on. 10. Cats mewing, and gathering oddly around their food bowls. 11. Kitchen cabinet door not securely closed. 12. Books in bookshelf not alphabetized. 13. Cigarette butt near front door. 14. Refrigerator magnets not parallel to sides of refrigerator. 15. Shampoo bottle half-empty.  Maybe I've simply been on vacation from my life for a while, and haven't realized it.

      I saw that horrific " Meet My Parents " tonight.  Yes,  exactly  like a car wreck.  I couldn't move from my seat to pee I was so transfixed by the carnage.  It was so medieval.  Literally.  It was medieval Europe, relations with a woman are brokered through her father.  She's just a transaction between two men.  But on top of that, the potential "boyfriends" were completely castrated by the whole process.  The princess turned to Tom Cruise at one point, (he was Tom Cruise, I swear -- okay,  Tom's Clone ) she turned to  Tom's Clone  and said, "you're just a real little horndog, r'ncha'?  I think we should just cut off your little dingle there and teach you a lesson."  So much of the show was just about humiliating the princes.  I, of course, was routing for  Brandon on 90210,  but he was too crafty and snotty (one of the lie detector questions the Dad asked him was, "Do you think you're smarter than me?" and Brandon lied and said, "uh..No?")  Besides being short.  And having dated a black woman.   So of course, Dad, in a true fascistic fashion, choose the Nazi-lookalike,  Dolph Lundgren .  At the end there was a group hug, and they all embraced and weeped about the beauty of their middle class, American whiteness.

      I dreamt last night about the devil and my family.  I dreamt that my cousin and many others moved into my parents house in California, and I was still living at home. I think we were all teenagers.  It alternated between my parent's house, and a really grim looking gothic orphanage.  All the other children (who didn't belong, as I kept telling them) kept impinging on my space.  I was also in college, and they kept using my computer, and sitting on my notebooks when I was trying to do class work.  Just generally getting in my way.  I ended up trying to strangle the boyfriend of my cousin because he kicked me.  Everyone was pretty much ignoring my complaints until Faith from Buffy the Vampire Slayer showed up.  She told me she would kick anyone's ass who messed with me.  This made me quite happy.

I'm not sure if it's really the flu, or just a reaction to all the hormones my doctors are pumping into me.  I think my resistance has been lowered alot.  I made 6 tiny paintings today, to sell tomorrow real cheap, in the style of the graffitti artist, Twist, or McGee.  Okay, not only in the style of, but a blantant rip-off.  I hope it's not too hot tomorrow.  Please come.  Yes.  I'm selling some pieces for 15 bucks.  Once again, it's at the 30th Ave subway stop in Astoria, on the N line, 30th Ave and 29th Street, in the bricked up park where all the teenagers skate at dusk, where Athena stands, looking really dorky.

      When I have a fever, my sense of touch is hieghtened.  I feel the creases of cloth on my calves from my dockers, and the scratch on my thigh where my cat dug in and jumped seems to sing to me.  My fingernails itch from their polish.  I feel how greasy and limp my hair is,  but I'm too tired to shower.  I just crawl from my aero-bed underneath the air conditioner to my computer, and back again.  Then my cats forced me to crawl to the deli for cat food.  I don't know if I should indulge this eating addiction.  Lots of cats go for weeks without eating, I keep telling them.  But they demand to be fed DAILY.  What's that about?  When I was obeying my cats, I picked up a coffee hagen daz for myself.  The summer after I graduated from college, before I got accepted to grad school, I lived in a nasty Portland apartment with the man I hopelessly loved and hated and his two snotty, artistic and pathetic room mates.  I was, of course, the most snotty, artistic and pathetic of the four of us.  There was a 7-11 next to the apartment building, and that summer I lived on foodstuffs from there, mostly coffee hagen daz, raspberry poptarts, and cheetos.  The man and I fought most of the time, and I spent half my days curled up on the futon on the floor, sobbing, while he sat up and looked at the ceiling in disgust.  Then every weekend I would go stay with my other boyfriend down the block.  He wasn't an artist, so there was a lot less drama, a lot less competitiveness, a lot less "your writing sucks" and badly concealed giggling.  So of course he was less attractive to me.  I believe he's an ambassador in Russia right now, or something.

      I'm working on a poem on  Henry Darger , the psychotic, prolific folk artist who made thousands of drawings and stories about naked girls with penises being tortured.  Darger, he saw the inside of us, he knew the danger of little girls, even with watercolor butterfly wings they can't be trusted.

      I saw the beta version of the magazine I write and edit for,  Wide Angle.   It was so fantastic.  It's going to blow the Voice out of the water.  You can go to the website to order a copy in a couple weeks: www.wideanglenyc.com.  The site won't be up for a few weeks.  The design is so great.  You all must buy ad space.  Must.  Buy.

      In other, much more appropriate and less personal news, I am going to be selling some, or hopefully, all, of my paintings at the Art Fair this coming Sunday.  Miss Olga will be sharing my space, making me look bad with her much superior work.  Last year I had a wonderful time, sold about 20 pieces, all of which I miss horribly, but it was time to let go.  It was also a great time to meet other artists -- that's how I first started connecting with all the other artsy and poesy folk in Astoria.  My motto was and will forever be, "Paintings for sale or swap."  If you have some art I really like, we can do a trade.  Also, if you're a close personal friend, or pretend to be, you might get a piece for free.

      I've been cleaning like a madwoman this weekend.  Hauled out 6 more 30 gallon bags of garbage.  My bedroom is still a disaster.  I tried painting the peeling, sagging, bubbly wall in my living room, only to have the new paint peel and sag some more.  I'll try again tomorrow.    I've been trying to avoid thinking, I'm so hyper active nervous about work.  It seems from all sorts of odd, random things that have been happening, that my department is going to close soon.  Uggh.  Plus, add to the list of things I should know by now: 42. Never date anyone from work.  Every time I date a new man, I end up wishing I just taken the easy way out and hit myself in the head with a hammer again.  Instead of getting my hopes up.  At least you're  certain   with the hammer.  Wham.  Bam.  No thank you, Ma'am.    I spent the eveining tonight going to *Cafe Bar and *Tupelo (Woah, *Astoria hot spots*) with the darling Miss  Olga . Much of said evening was spent dispensing relationship advice to said  Olga , although with many disclaimers about being a walking, woman-shaped, flypaper trap for bad relationships.  Boy, that metaphor really worked, didn't it. I impress myself.  Man, I hate the break-up speach.  Although it has gotten easier.  I just got to remember to always do it over the phone, and cut things short so we don't get into the  real  reasons I never want to see your mug again. Ever.  Never is too soon.    (Clears throat.) "I just don't think we have any chemistry.  No, our personalities just don't mesh.  I'm just not feeling it.  Sorry.  I wish it could have worked out."  See?  Isn't that better than, "Ever since you told me about trying to strangle your ex with a belt after she sliced you with a broken bottle, I've had my doubts.  Like, quick-run-the-other-way-doubts."

      I just remembered how much I liked  urlLink Richard Brautigan   in high school.  I love his style.  It's so flat.  It feels like the antidote to mine -- I'm so hyper and purple, like if I don't scream I can't be heard.  I remember reading his story about the abortion before I knew what one really was.  It still seemed terrifying.

      Not the worst part, the worst part is that I have  a cat in heat who's making  the love  with my purse  (in Spanish, that's called "making sexo" isn't that adorable?)-- no, I mean the worst part is I'm losing it, hence the loose associations -- no, but the really worst part is that this kid might really hurt someone, of course.  But the bad,  flash backy  part for me is because when I was fresh out of social work school and working in a homeless shelter, I made the same call for a homeless schizophrenic woman.  I could just tell she was extremely dangerous -- there's a feeling you become exsquisitely attuned to when you work with the crazies, kind'a like how I used to be so specially attuned to my father's moods, whether it's the paranoid unblinking stare they lock on you, or just how you feel the hair on your forearms stand on end -- you know,  for certain.   But EMS came and refused to hospitalize her.  They said she was fine.  So she left the shelter after that, and a month later, was on the 6 o'clock news for stabbing some guy to death on the subway.  It wasn't anyone she knew.  He had "looked at her funny" according to her.

      My job has been so supremely fucked up this week.  It's hard to write about without just boiling over.  For example, I had to make a report because some kids said they were... I can't go into the details, but I had to make a report.  I didn't think they were being horribly abused, I just thought there should be an investigation and some things had to be changed, pronto.  So the fuck-ups in fostercare, rather than just doing the investigation as if from an anonymous tip, like they were supposed to, confronted the foster mother and kept saying, "the therapist said X" so of course the foster mother ran over to the children and said, "how dare you? how could you say that about me to your therapist!  Never speak to her again!"  So of course the poor little kids, who were just beginning to trust me after years of the most horrific abuse from their parents, come and sit in my office and just stare at me with big, weeping eyes.  It's just like the  Bangles  sang . Their lips are sealed.     Guilt, much?  And then.  THEN!! Or actually, sort of, previously.  I was asked to do an eval of a kid they were worried about, it turns out for very good reason, as she was homicidal and psychotic, which is not a good mix, unless you're Micheal.  You know, Mike with the hockey mask.   Ding-Ding-Ding   Ding-Ding-Ding  Dong-Dong-Ding .    That's my last attempt at being a musician.  So I said, yeah, take her to the hospital, now!  And then suddenly every body's backpedalling and saying that she was just making stuff up and she's not really dangerous, and in fact, IN FACT, we are going to put three more children in the home with her, starting TONIGHT.  Never mind that this child has knifed other children in the past.  It was just so awful.  And what's especially annoying is that I'm the only mental health professional!  I'm the only equipped to and experienced at making these sorts of evaluations!  And then nobody listens.

       Loft Poem   In your loft with the lights low we sit talking as I want to fuck you speechless.  I look into your pretty brown eyes and will your fist up my cunt. We talk about politics, spirituality, the knicks, who gives a fuck?  I try to radiate sex juice in your direction. If I get any more frustrated, these dirty windows will shatter like when a soprano hits a high "C".  I hint that I'm "a woman with a past." I hint that I'm "easy."  It's 4am and my throat is sore from all this goddamn intellectualizing. I'm dizzy from lust, fatigue and your cigarette smoke.  I say I need to get to bed. You gesture towards the couch and slouch off towards your room.  You wish!  In five minutes I knock on your door and let myself in.  Your belly is soft, concave and covered in darling brown curls. Your cock tastes of piss and scented toilet paper. Then just of cock.  Afterwards, I whine into my hand, "Four hours of talk!" You are hurt,  crease your sweet brow and say, "What? You didn't enjoy our conversation?"

      I went to the "wonderful" 4th party by Lisa and she made fun of me for wearing what she called a "slip" instead of a dress, although it's actually a slip dress.  Everyone else at the party came to my rescue and told me how nice I looked, but it still stung, and had me pondering all evening why exactly I'm friends with this women who immediately mocks me after not seeing me for two years.  She's always had a bitchy edge that leaves me smarting.  And then I have to question myself, "I am too sensitive?  Am I really wearing a slip?"  It also didn't help matters that I was the youngest adult at the party by 15 years.  At one point everyone, and I mean the whole party of about ten, turned to me and asked me, "why on earth do you have tattoos?"  and when I patiently tried to explain, made it clear that they weren't really interested.  then I got home and things just sucked more.

      I'm going to the greatest party on the planet this evening, the 4th of July de Lisa!  Every year my friend Lisa has this party, which always rocks.  She lives on Waterside Plaza, which is in the twenties and on the East River.  She's so close to the fireworks that when they go off, her windows rattle like they're going to break.  When you stand in the plaza to watch, you can feel the explosions in your chest.  It almost interrupts your heartbeat. It's like triple those Dolby sound advertisements in movie theaters.

      A confession: when I was a little girl, I was addicted to shocking pink, and demanded that my mom paint my bedroom that color. I'm talking way beyond pepto-bismol pink. I'm talking vibrating, hurts your eyes pink. When we were selling the house so we could move to California, she painted it all over, which made me cry. I used to measure the heights of my stuffed animals with a crayon on those walls, to check and see if they were growing. My mom has always been a bit of DIY'er, so a lot of my furniture was mismatched and half-painted with sloppy, ambitious colors. Okay, so she was a depressed, alcoholic DIY'er, but it's the thought that counts. She gave me permission to be a slob. Which let me be very creative... but also, I'm still a slob!

      Can you imagine being a child and having a room like this?    What a nightmare.  How 'bout just shoving that femininity down your girl's throat, mom. What's also annoying is that you can tell that the kids had no input to this.  It's a magazine's idea of a little girl's room.  There's no room for spontaneous weirdness, which, we all know, is what kids are really about.

She creeps out of the ocean, and this time no one comes  running with gauze.  Her eyes no longer crook like the finger of a Penthouse Pet but take your measure and look  away.  Breasts  that once invited, rising like bread to your tongue, have hardened into  wooden paddles.  You've been bad.  Black bees hum in the back of her throat.  What was that, Honey? you say.

People really don't care how extensive my MP3 collection is. 2. Movie buffs are just people who can't accept that they're not capable of making their own movies. 3. I am not as attractive to homosexuals as I think I am. 4. Life is not like a porn movie. 5. It's still illegal, regardless if I get caught. 6. Pretending that I am a conneisseur of fine foods, owning numerous handheld gadgets, and claiming stakes to liking excellent movies and music does not actually compensate for not having any real redeeming qualities that girls would find attractive, nor a small penis.

       Grammar   What is this thing called protocol? What is the protocol for things. These things have taken over. They mill about behind my back and freeze  when I re-enter the room.  This fork, chair and Nintendo game whisper when the light is out, catalyze strange chemical reactions that result in time lapses, dream-like waking states, and phone calls at 3am.  At the other end there is only static. Always at the end,  static.

       The Wig   Once it's on, its tentacles are in you forever.  You must wear it neatly every day.  No use pretending, as with the myth of parental love that we can just forget about yesterday, the blood, that spasm and fist.  With the wig, once they see the real you, it can never be the same.

       The Man with the Mile Wide Penis   Like Joan of Arc, at age ten, an Angel came down and gave him a sword.  He was 12 when the first woman fainted at the sight of him.  God has decreed he should share his gift, but there are too many women and not enough time.  With great power comes  great responsibility.  It haunts him. Sometimes he curses it, and weeps. He wakes to find his sheets destroyed. Sometimes they don't wait until he's asleep.  Women creep into the house. His lock has been picked so many times  it hangs open, slack like the legs of a virgin in his path.  He puts his pants on one leg at a time it just takes him longer.

       Boy on the subway   Shaved head, no shirt. Dirt everywhere. Black cut-offs suspended with dog chains. His sneakered toes point delicately together, like a ballerina poses when she is day dreaming. He rocks. He could be high. He is probably 16. He's definitely homeless. He is the left handed side of the city, bastard, squirming and hungry-- the Bed-stuy of the soul. He is writing, endlessly. Watches us all.

       Crazy boyfriend   I woke up one morning and Micheal was gone. A stranger had moved into his head. This trembling white mass of flesh sat up next to me in bed, rolled its eyes and said in a voice I didn't recognize  that he was leaving for work. I saw it wasn't Mike. I didn't know what to say. After he left, I called the police. They told me to take him to the hospital. Maybe to remove the new guy from his brain. The day before, I had told Michael to meet me for lunch in Washington Square Park. I don't know if he heard me. He'd been really busy lately. Writing stuff all night long, lists I didn't quite understand. And now this. So the new guy did show up with Michael's body at the right time for lunch. I got him to come with me to the hospital. It wasn't very easy. I only hit him once. He tried to touch me. I don't let strangers touch me. When he got out of the hospital, he slept most of the time. His hands and faced twitched when he slept. I watched him sleep alot. There wasn't much else to do.

      My  urlLink September 11th poem.

      Last night, right before I fell asleep, me and the boyfriend started talking about September 11, and how the anniversary is coming up.  I started remembering how I was being abused by my (now ex)boyfriend at that point -- I always connect the terrorist attack with my own private terrorist -- and it was getting pretty flashbacky.    But then we moved on to more pleasant topics.  Such as how I was going to force the (now current) boyfriend to visit me in upstate NY when I move up there to finish my Ph.D. in English.  Drugging, Kidnapping, Bribing, were all explored. In, of course, totally non-threatening ways.  So then I fell asleep and I dreamt that I was living in a homeless shelter for teenage girls in California.  All the girls felt compelled to prostitute themselves in the most dangerous areas.  Then the girls ended up being stabbed and sent to the hospital. Or just plain killed.  The men the girls met lived under bridges, and carried knives, broken mirrors, and sharpened metal sticks to hurt the girls.  In the dream I kept trying to counsel the girls so that they would prostitute themselves in safer ways; it didn't even occur to me to tell them to stop.  Then I was woken up by a woman screaming, "No, NO! STOP!" and sobbing.  I couldn't find the source of the screaming; it was very faint.  I got dressed to get ready to go outside to find the woman, and call the police. But the noise kept stopping.  I put my ear to this wall and that, and leaned out the window.  Eventually I realized that I had imagined it, that sometimes the wind and the rain and the busses outside sounded vaguely like a scream.  As soon as I tried to fall asleep, I would hear it again.  Did I mention how much I am looking forward to September 11?  I nearly died on September 19, from something related.    Ugh. Hmm. words escape.

      Somebody actually likes the poem below, which I find amazing.  I also just found out that "Amorous Morsels" and "Spring", which are on my  urlLink poetry page,  got accepted for money!  My first cash for poems.  I am happy, thusly.

       The Cul de sac Angel   with wings made of safety pins, used tampons and bottlecaps, softly swoops down and kisses the place under the left breast of all the middle-aged single women in Ohio whose bras are too tight, who get a little sore  spot right there, on the fragile skin over the heart -- every night before each  of those women takes her last breath before dreaming of kisses she'll never have, or had but never wanted, she feels a tingle right there -- like the start of a heart attack or the glowing thumbprint of a saint or how a thumbprint might feel if a saint were to touch her or anyone to touch her: Anyone who wasn't  coolly shaking  her hand goodbye.

      And this is my plan for  teaching poetry!   My philosophy of teaching poetry, or what will happen in this class.  This is a class for poets at all levels.  First of all, there will be reading of other poets.  And then there will be writing.  Lots of both.  I will bring in poems that I have found to be a catalyst for my own writing, in both style and content.  I want people to forget about what they think a poem should be, and how it should sound or look.  My philosophy is “make it new”.  (Yes, Ezra Pound said that first.) I will focus on helping students create original and genuine language and ideas. I want each student, by the end of the class, to have her own unique definition of what makes a poem.  Each meeting, I will assign three students to bring in their own poems and have them discussed.  Students may tell the class how much criticism they want, and how comfortable they feel with certain kinds of critique. The class should feel safe enough so that each student can try something new and not be afraid of the class’s reaction.  Don’t worry about what your mother would think or what is politically correct.  I encourage to students to write about what moves them deeply, what makes them cry and then makes them feel silly.  If students like, they can give me other poems in excess of what is assigned and I will critique them and bring them back the following week.  I encourage all students to try new things, to write about things that scare them.  And... I have a personal bias against rhyme.  Also, no sex between students unless I'm involved.  Okay, the last bit won't go in the catalogue.

       I am teaching a poetry class,  teaching a poetry class,  teaching a poetry class!   (Sung to the tune of "closer" by NIN, or "Mary Had a Little Lamb", depending on your preference.)  It starts October 6th, which is a Sunday.  And runs for 8 weeks.  It costs $180, unless you're a member of the Women's Studio Center, in which case it costs less.  It will be held in the Women's Studio Center, which is walking distance from Queen's Plaza/Queensboro Plaza in LIC.  First stop in Queens From Manhattan on the N, etc. And it will be lots of fun, even though no men are allowed, because it's the women's studio..., so you cannot expect to pick up cute guys there, but, if you're gay or bi, you might get lucky.  No guarantees.

        I just got this email:    "hey christine,  saw your writing on the web, think it's fucking amazing. was wondering if you'd like to submit some writing to my ezine digitalhammer.com? we only have a few interviews up right now, moe tucker, anya janssen (her art is up too), tod a., maggie dubris‹diamanda galas is set to go up soon. also a slew of writing should be going up when joe (the webmaster) has time, very cool stuff. i would be honored if you'd be a part of it.  picking my teeth with the tongues of the wicked,  trish warden"  And I started screaming and nearly fainted.  Do you know who Trish Warden is?  Only Just About My Favorite Poet In the Whole World.  I read her book "Attack God Inside" so many times it's completely trashed.  Most of her stuff is out of print, and I've spent hours looking for her other book, "brainlift" in all the used book stores in NYC.  "Attack God Inside" has been a major inspiration for me, and was one of the things I read constantly when I really started writing poetry seriously about two years ago.  I've been horribly sick today and had to crawl home from work, and the excitement from this is making me worse!

      No, I didn't have a reactive psychosis to my promotion.  I do get to be the boss But I only get a thousand bucks more than I was making as non-boss.  I feel like I dropped the soap in jail.  Is that a homophobic comment? Anyway, I feel fucked.  The piece below was the poem, hysterical blindness, after I ran it through the Google translator.  From English to Spanish, to Italian, to German, to English.  I like some of the phrases, "this whole spirit and exchange of the physical liquids" "We have the all day we were only twice kissed."  Thanks to the enigmatic Todd Colby who gave me the idea.

       The life of the blindness De Hysterical    My is full of the pain.   Those could have been a choice.  They  are not absolutely  safe -- broad sveglisi to the patient to the morning,  nauseated from the whole light.  My feet,  which go the mattress for giving the Plasterung forwards to suffering  that, which shoots in any place.   It could have been hipocondriaco.   I must ask  mine doctor, but  it stopped,  over of my calls to send back  the last month.   It said that it reached too much  intensively to us,  this whole spirit and exchange of the physical liquids.   Which had for látex.   Task, which shows a fear before segretezza.   We have the all day we were only twice kissed, those together.   In which case hour more rueber.   It does not renew my regulation for codeina.   And lasci with this jaqueca I and artificially  an inflation behind my the left ear.   My skin, sums at the times, during my Eidotter barretta.   They are sure that it is for the  safe code category  of the paralysis premonitory.   And the light, ah, the light!  Escalda my eyes.   It constantly forms rasgón it.  That cannot be normal.   Dígame, this cannot be normal.

      The Reading this weekend in Astoria Park was cancelled.  Twice.  Saturday it was rescheduled to Sunday, and Sunday I didn't get the cancellation notice until after I had wandered around the park for twenty minutes like a dork.  I was pissed, but it turns out that the woman organizing it didn't have my correct phone number, etc.  Me and the boyfriend did not fight at all this weekend, which was sort of a choice on my part, but made my life boring.  Instead of fighting I had to go rent movies, and they went near as emotionally moving as the real thing.  Sounds like I need a life, huh? I'm all stressed out about the promotion -- so many new responsibilities, so much area to fuck up.  Arrgh.  I can't take a "sleep day" like a did in the past when I felt overwhelmed.

      So, things have been repaired with  the boyfriend  (notice I didn't say  evil ) as much as possible, and I'm doing a reading tonight in Astoria Park.  And, and... I'm now the   Boss Lady  !  Yeah!  I got a tiny little raise, because I was too chicken to ask for anything more, but the director of the whole agency, who I'd only met once before, said she heard wonderful things about me, and that they really wanted me to stay.  Hee, hee, hee.  I am the bestest. So I'm making all my former co-workers call me   boss lady   and bow when they see me.  But some of them refuse!  Can you believe it!  But you know, like they say in  Spiderman , with great power comes great responsiblity.  hehehe.  I said, Power.

      You know, I might be a little slow, but I just realized that I should probably not be posting certain information under my real name.  Because then just about anybody could connect the dots.And I think I'm in trouble.  The internet used to be such a small, anonymous place, nobody knew anybody, nobody cared, and NOBODY DID SEARCHES USING MY NAME. Which has been happening about three times a day.  It makes me a little uneasy, ya know?

      I wrote a new poem, just this afternoon.   Hysterical Blindness   My life is full of pain.  This could be a choice. I'm not quite sure -- I wake up sick in the morning, nauseated by all the light. My feet leaving the mattress for the floor gives me shooting pains  somewhere. I could be a hypochondriac. I'll have to ask my doctor, but she stopped returning my calls last month.  She said it was getting too intense  between us, all that blood and exchange of bodily fluids. She had a thing for latex. I think that shows a fear of intimacy. We only kissed twice the whole time  we were together. Anyway, it's over now. She won't even renew my prescription for codeine.  And I'm left with this migraine and an unnatural swelling behind my left ear. My skin, it tingles sometimes, along my fingertips. I'm sure it's the precursor  to some sort of paralysis.  And the light, ah, the light! It scalds my eyes. Makes them tear constantly. This can't be normal. Tell me, this can't be normal.

      Anyway, so I walk into work (I started typing "church" -- what's up with that?) today and my boss is gone, as well as Helena the charming sect. that ran the place.  Yep. My boss was escorted out of the building Friday, and Helena was asked to leave this morning before I came in.  And every one said I was just being paranoid. Ha!  Except it's not really funny.  It's kind of unsettling.  Plus, now my boss's boss is my boss, and she is SUCH a super bitch.  We had a meeting wherein the responsiblities of my (ex)boss were distributed between me and my coworker.  The super-bitch boss kept saying, I need this report by 1PM tomorrow, on my desk, and I would respond and say, okay, but what about all my patients?  Do want me to cancel them?  Stop seeing them entirely, or what?  This really irritated her.    I hated my old boss (duh) but I wish there were someone better replacing him.  It's just so wierd to walk into work and have everything up-side down like that.  And even though it's a social work agency, they don't believe in processing.  The meeting started with one sentence, unfortunately, (old boss) had to be let go, and then New Boss went on as if nothing had happened.    Luckily for me, I returned home to find a message from the job I wanted!  She said to call her right away.  A good sign, no?

      I dreamed last night that I had super-powers, and I had to keep fighting this evil force that was threatening everyone.  I had to put my hands together in front of my chest and squinch my eyes really hard and a silver ball would appear and shatter on the bad guy, weakening him.  I was a guest or distant cousin to this really nice, church going black family.  I had to keep protecting them from the evil.  All this happened at my grandmother's house in Saratoga.  I had very long, strong fingernails.  I worried a lot about whether or not I was a racist, and if the polar ice was melting.

I remember the opening act, some guy in a black body suit who juggled lights, better than I remember the music.  I fell asleep during the concert.  I fall asleep during most concerts.  Really loud, ear drum shattering rock music has a way of lulling me to sleep.  It must sound like my mother’s heart beat.  Not that she’d ever admit it.   I slept through  Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads, Blue Oyster Cult, Grateful Dead , to name a few.  I was a real  wild  teenager.  Sleepy, tho.

      The absolutely obvious and horrible thing about getting involved with anyone is that it’s taking a risk.  And more often than not, things go awry and you end up hurt.

At my current job, no one has lasted more than 2.  My boss-that-I-hate has been there 9 months.  I’ve been so bitchy to him lately that he’s gotten less lovey-dovey and more nasty.   Eeh.   Every time I speak to him, I end my sentences in my mind with, “and you can kiss my ass.”    I don’t think I’m the only one that does this.

That was for the job I really wanted.  I think I got nervous, and when I get nervous, I use really long words.  Badly.  Writing a poem called, "Black Market Boyfriend."

(On an unrelated note, I've discovered two things: you can get really sore from working out at the gym, and most of the people at the gym most of the time are men, really, really, hot men.  Smoking.  Ohmigod.)  So... relationship is proceeding.  Less than average number of bumps.  He tends to be much more kind than previous terrorists. Uh, boyfriends.    But There's One Big Caveat.  He lies.  All the time.  About lots of things.  Lots of times I can't figure out which is truth and which is lies.  This makes me paranoid and suspicious.  In short, rather crazy.  He's open about lying.  He's says he's a liar, and I just have to accept that fact.  Which is fine when he's resting his head in my lap and I'm petting his hair and we're watching some shitty action flick that amuses him on the TV.    It's just really nice to be with someone like that, quietly being together.  But then what is this togetherness?  Who am I really with?  and how many other women does he do this with?   I keep asking him if he could just try to be honest with me.  He's never been honest or monogamous with any woman.  I try to get him to explore something new.  I try to explain why honesty is better in any relationship.  Trust.  Trust is good, yes?  To be able to have some.  Seriously,  it's like he doesn't speak English or Spanish when I try to discuss this.  And he doesn't trust me at all.  He always thinks he's catching me when I talk, thinks I've made a mistep, that I've finally revealed that I'm cheating on him.  But I don't cheat or lie.  As you reader, must know, I have the opposite problem.  Too much Information.    So I don't know what to do.  I could turn a blind eye to the lying bit, and just enjoy what I have.  But I feel that will end badly.  I was thinking about an ultimatum, but that's just usually another way of breaking up.  I feel like if he would only trust me, and believe that I'm not lying, then he might think about being truthful with me.  And then, of course, there's the thought that he's lying for a reason, and when he does tell the truth, it'll be so awful I will break up with him.  Who knows?

      So.  Things are going somewhat well.  Finished three interviews this week.  The last one was for a job  I really want, for a good salary, at a place I've wanted to work at ever since I graduated social work school.  I've interviewed at one part of the agency or another 4 times over the past seven years.  The last time I had the second interview, but then  I was never called back.  Every time I interview there, I get really good vibes, and they seem very enthusiastic about me, but  I never get the job.  I'm just hoping this time, things will be different.  The other two interviews were okay -- one was a third interview for a senior center (two more to go on that) and one was to work with homeless men at a brand new residence, run by people who are completely overwhelmed, but loved their jobs (they told me this about three times).  I hope to be working by October 7th, that is the goal.    GRE next week.  And I'm going to STUDY.

      I discovered today, surprisingly enough, and contrary to much scientific research (as well as urban legend), that one feels better if one goes out during  the day  and  exercises .  There's something strange about sunlight and movement.  Really lifts the spirits.  Someone should do a study.  Anyway, must fly, as I have an interview this morning at ten.  It's way in the Bronx, but the interview will be good practice, if nothing else.  I leave you with an amusing quote from the Powellsbooks.com newsletter.  "This brief interlude is dedicated to the millions of unheralded, hardworking blank spaces who tirelessly and with pride perform the thankless task of unbeing in order that words should remain properly held apart."

      I'm in such a pissy mood.  I'm probably not getting paid this week for my work at the job I just quit because I didn't send them a "formal letter of resignation."  They suck the big one.  the blimpie, that is.  And I can't take the stupid GRE because I have no ID because I left in all in a cab last week.  And every body I sent spam to about my class is complaining and chastizing me.  C'mon, people!  Stiff upper lip!  It's not the end of the world, here.  I get spam all the time, and look at me.  Perfectly healthy.    Never doing that again.  Stupidheads.  That's what they're a bunch of.  Didn't want them in my class anyway.  They probably smell.  Speaking of the stupid poetry class, the stupid director of the stupid Women's Center just told me I could have men in my class.  So all the information I posted and sent all over the web is wrong.  Because she changed her mind.  When I wanted men in the first place!  Stupid.  Anyway, and then the stupid boyfriend and I had a fight last night because he revealed another major lie he told, which he said was a test to see my reaction.  And I wasn't supposed to get upset over this information.  He's stupid.  The wedding's off.  My cats aren't stupid.  Lovely creatures.  I've decided to stop going outside, except around midnight to get supplies.  I'm just going to make like my cats and eat and sleep, occassionally poop on my bed and make a big mess.  I need an owner to yell at me, tho'.  So next year, this time, I might be in Houston.  Or Upstate New York.  Or Florida.  Possibly Missouri.  I'm voting for Upstate NY, after all, I already got my MA there, I know all the professors.  Also I would miss the city too much to be far away.  You know, one bedroom apartment's up there are $250.  Incredible.

      I've been doing more reading than writing lately.  Besides sending my first, and probably last, spam to 400 near strangers to advertise my poetry class, I found lots of new great blogs.  Which I will link to soon.  One blog in Indonesia linked to my poetry page, and gave a little lecture about too much sex in poetry.  But it was a polite lecture, so I respect that.  Just finished faxing out 16 resumes for a job.  what's the emoticon for a Buddhist prayer?

       NEEDLE   "There was some sort of business with a rubber strap and I felt a thunk deep in my arm.  Then she was hitting my clenched fist: tapping it with her knuckles and then wiggling her finger in the center of my palm to loosen it.  It felt so much like an odd, stubborn sort of fingering that I laughed.  I sucked in air.  I had been holding my breath.  When I left my head felt light and loose, and my thigh muscles burned.  I felt like I had run a marathon.  Naked."

      So I've got to write something interesting here, if only to give the people at  urlLink eyeshot.net  a run for their money.  That's an expression my mother always uses.  Along with "slicker than a greased pig" and "running around like a chicken without a head."  Raised on a rural farm, my mom.  The ghetto kids don't have nothing on her childhood.  Sort of like  Bastard out of Carolina , but not so pretty.

      Quit my job yesterday.  There was a particularly horrendous meeting which was characterized by multiple attacks on my judgment, intelligence, etc.  I went to lunch so I could stop crying, then went back, marched up to my boss, said "I quit," and left.

I'm applying for a NYFA grant for poetry in a few weeks, and I'm trying to figure out which ten poems to send.  Please go  urlLink here,  pick your ten favorite, and email me the results.  Send the titles of the poems, along with numbers showing how they rank in your estimation.  I'll send you a cookie.

      It's so interesting dating someone who doesn't speak English.  It puts all our interactions into another realm.  In disagreement with Descarte, Oliver Sacks -- and he's probably not the first one -- has argued that language proceeds thought, and even creates personality.  So it feels like this relationship occurs in a space never inhabited before.  And this is good, because I get bored very easily.  And when I get bored, I cause trouble.  I'm not proud to admit this, but one of the things that kept my relationship going strong with Crazy Boyfriend was that every time they lowered his dose of Haldol, he got a new personality.  Made things interesting.  He even changed physically a great deal.  Lost and gained wieght, changed hair colors, etc.  Okay, but then the homocidal ideation got boring.

To quote:  ""The Grandest Insanity Poetry has yet." -The Los Angeles Times  Come and watch the Yogurts Saturday, September 7 at 10 PM  at the legendary Bowery Poetry Club  308 Bowery @ Bleecker,  right across from CBGB's  F train to Second Ave | 6 train to Bleecker | 212-614-0505  only $5   www.bowerypoetry.com"  You should all go.  I even cancelled with the boyfriend for Saturday, seeing how he's sabotaged every other social engagement I planned on attending with him.  So I can wait to make sexo until Sunday, I'm not desperate or nothing.  Don't listen to what they tell you.

      Right, as I mentioned, I'm getting paid for two poems. Yippee.  No, I mean that.  At C/Oasis.  Whatever the hell that title means.  I think I submitted these poems 3-4 months ago.  Anyway, Taint picked up The Empty Bed, and I'm getting some nonfiction published at eyeshot.net.  I'm also working on a review of "Signs" which I think is fantastic-- not the review, the movie.  I've already cooked up references to Nabokov, who wrote a short story, "Signs" and Checkov.  It's all in the movie, I swear.  It's very, but not intrusively, post-modern, or even maybe, post-post modern, which would be, what, stop-modern, if you want to get a little pig-latiny with it, and why not.

      So my holiday weekend was eventful, and not in a good, "had a barbeque with friends" kind of way.  I got to that spot again, the place that I hate but seem to always end up in, where I'm caring for a previously kind and loving significant other who has become psychotic/blind drunk/completely high, and is threatening me implicitly or explicitly with death or bodily harm.  This time I did a little better job of taking care of myself.  I mean, after he spilled beer all over the apartment, fell and hit his head more than a few times, called me a "puta" 50 times and worst of all, HURT MY CAT, I realized that he needed to leave my apartment, pronto.  Of course, it took me an hour after that decision to actually get him out the apartment door, and then there was the cab drive from hell where he kept arguing with the driver and giving him directions (wrong, directions) but eventually I got him dropped off at his apartment.  Of course, he was a little confused when I didn't climb out of the cab with him and instead sped away into the rain.  I actually had to yell at the cab driver, GO, now, drive!  go!  just like in the movies.  Mucho excitement.     Donch'a hate it when that happens.   Then he actually apologized the next day, which was a first for me.  Usually I get scoffed at.

      I went to several galleries in Chelsea this afternoon.  I saw this photomontage artist I worship!  She did that thing I like so much, mixing the grotesque with the girly, fairytales and porn, crude and slick.  Her name is Marnie Weber and she's at the Fredericks Freiser Gallery, which must be a pretty small affair, as they are in some sort of basement.  She made a very elaborate dollhouse, and took pictures of the interiors and then collaged gruesome fairy-tale sort narratives on to them, using photos of the faces of manequeins and photos of the bodies of little girls in dresses.  Plus there were dancing bears, jewels, etc. It reminded me a bit of Kiki Smith's work around little Red Riding Hood, but not so carefully plotted in different media.

      Anyway, I want to burden you with the super sad-sack story of me getting fired.  On Wednesday, I went to see the Optomistrist (okay, I can't spell!) during lunch to finally get a new pair of glasses.  At the very end of the exam, the optimistrist (yes, I know about the spelling!) squirted some stuff in my eyes to do some sort glaucoma test.  I had a violent allergic reaction.  I started retching and had to run out of the store.  After relieving my stomach on the street corner, I managed to hail a cab and go home.  As soon as I got home and was able to, I called my boss and told him what happened.  They next day, when I returned to work, I was fired for being unresponsible.

      Went on a spur-of the-moment trip with a hispanic church group to Altantic city Saturday.  The boyfriend invited me, which was intensely flattering, as he is quite hesistant to invite me to meet his friends, go to his parties, etc.  And he's very reluctant to come to Christine related events, although I ask him all the time.  Not quite sure what that is about, though it might be language related.  It was lots of fun and I got to get up close and personal with way too many new Jersey bachelor and bacherlorette parties.  It took me a while to realize that not all the women dressed like hookers were hookers -- I think at least 50% of them were just middle class 18 year olds from New Jersey with too much time, lip gloss and cleavage on their hands.  We went with a very nice and rather elderly Roman Catholic priest who the boyfriend has been friends with since the boyfriend arrived in America.  Somehow, this kind of Catholic priest can marry and have kids, which I'm still trying to figure out.  Maybe it's that Latin American Magical Realism.  Don't know.  Anyway, so one point among the dinging and the pinging and the trilling and flashing, the boyfriend turned to the priest and said, yes, father you will be the one to marry us.  And Mr. Padre turned to me and I said, no, no, not, un-un, neg.   etc.  Not because I so don't want to marry the boyfriend.   I'm not sure how I feel about that.  I mean, we'd have to know each other for a couple years before I could make that kind of decision, or then again, at least 6 months.  But because no way am I having a Catholic wedding.  No way.  Somehow, Buddhism would have to surface in the ceremony and I'm not CHRISTIAN.

      My new a job is making me bipolar, as it is both very good and very bad, depending on the hour.  This week (my second) my boss took me aside and said, "you've only been here a week and you've managed to annoy my whole staff."  He told me I was rude and anti-social.  Unforturnately, I've been extremely nice to everyone, so I had no idea what he was talking about.  Anyway, it was very highschool, the administrative staff huddling behind my back and saying how awful I was, while being pleasant to my face.  Plus my boss is incapable of saying anything positive about my work.  But, the good part is... I love doing straight therapy, which is what I'm doing.  If I'm just left alone, I'll be happy.

      My poetry's  urlLink here,  in case you forgot.  This is a draft of something new:   A Pretty Girl and Her Mother,  the Day After   So everything's the same but nothing's  changed.  You moved your house Haven't you?  Or perhaps just the  furniture's reversed.  Maybe it's you. You changed the part in your hair, the gap in your teeth the side your buttons button on. I believe it is you. You look a little like you. Or one or the other of us. I'm afraid to touch your hand, there. Right now. It will be cold.   Like that awful mirror behind us. On that side, again.

      Watched BTVs this evening, of course.  And there's wierd little web-interactive thing going on.  In the eppy, there's a little lost high-school girl (what's new) who is actually a 30 year-old actress I've seen before in several failed sitcoms (what else is new) who has a website that the characters visit again and again, and quote, etc.  Okay, the eerie thing is, there actually is that website at  urlLink www.cassienewton.com   and it is very authentic looking.  There's no little winks or nods or hidden links to WB11 or buffydotcom or nothing. And it's a free geocities site!  How low class can you get?   And the art shown in the girl's room in the show is on the site and there's no "real" artists' signatures, although I get the feeling that each of the paintings was done by someone else.  The few give-aways to the hoax is that although the html for the pages is very sophisticated, lots of Java, etc., the paintings are scanned in very amateurishly, although the girl didn't have photoshop to crop them.  Although she had photoshop to do the other stuff.  So it's like they were trying to show how a teenager would do it, but weren't quite consistent.  Also, the poetry is badddd.  Just like many teenagers, but also just a little too good.  It's just wierd to be able to see on my (computer) screen, what I just saw actors looking at on my (tv) screen.

      Hullo to all you faithful readers from the south!  I have no idea who you are, but I can tell from my tracking device that you're southern.  And that ALOT of people look up "penis bouquet" on Google.  Anyway, so I went into the Strand today and managed to escape with the damage being only two poetry books, a short story collection, and book of the notebooks and photos of William Gedney.  Gedney was a fantastic photographer who took photos of San Francisco in the '60's.  Mostly he took black and white shots of stoned people sleeping on the floor of burnt out hotels, looking quite miserable.  Hee.  Flower power.    I realized after looking at several pictures of long haired, bearded, bejeweled, etc. people, that everyone still dresses like that in San Fran.  Most of the pictures could have been taken yesterday.  Especially along the Haight, San Franciso is stuck in one of those Star Trek time loops, where every thing repeats itself.  Maybe the farther away you get from SF, the more the ripple effect from the time distortion wears off, so that in Oakland, for example, it's 1980 right now.  Although I'm feeling that in Weed, California, it's still the 60's.

      Anyway, I had tea today at the Plaza Hotel.  It was quite swellegant, but the rich food gave me a tummy ache and I left early.  Definitely not my preferred scene.  You know, I'm more a lower East side kinda' gal.  I sat next to the darling and vicious Yelena, who is a brillant writer and painter.  And has a very pointed and forked tongue.  So, amidst the rest of the company, which were mostly Christians, though (mostly) not annoyingly so, she and I spoke quite frankly about sex.  She made a sex coloring book which sounds absolutely fab, and we talked about marketing ploys while I asked for advice about spicing up the scene when things are vanilla, yet satisfying, in the bedroom.  Not about anyone in specific!!  Geesh.    Anyway, something quite amusing and cinematic happened.   Yelena likes glitzy and actually expensive jewelery, and she just happened to be wearing a dramatic and bejeweled cross.  One of the Christian women who'd been sitting far away from us scooted up close and said, all friendly and crisp-like, "That's a beautiful cross.  Is there a story behind it?''  Yelena paused for a moment.  "Yes," she said.  "My husband bought it for me and for that I was so grateful that I had wild sex with him three times."  Yelena has a dramatic Russian accent, which makes everything she says sound more important than it really is.  The woman was wearing a hat with fake flowers.  She retreated a bit back into the hat, like a turtle.  "Oh, and Yelena forget to add that she's Jewish," I quipped.  The woman said, "Oh yes.  That's a little more information than I needed to know," and skirted quickly away.    Yelena and I gave each other a look that was the equivalent of a high five, and burst out laughing.    Yes, I know it was very immature.  Very, very immature.  Hee.

      I believe the pro-life movement is responsible for the quality of abortion surgery being generally so low, and for the resultant deaths from those doctors who don't know, or care, what the fuck they're doing.  The press gets involved after a few deaths, (anybody remember the 'Butcher of Avenue B', in the mid-ninities?), but still, the hullabuloo dies down quickly, and the butchers go on butchering.

      So the new job is underneath, yes, directly underneath, one of NYC's most revered abortion clinics.  Which is both good and bad, as I am rabidly pro-choice.  The good: the whole place is very woman-centric.  The bad: I have to refrain from either A) slapping the shit out of the protesters outside whining "choose life" every time I enter the building, and B) threatening to slap the shit out of the protesters outside whining.   Friday I had an epihany  and realized that I could get fired for even the threat of violence.  Free speech is a bitch.  I mean, their free speech.  I know that pesky amendment doesn't allow me to threaten to kill them.    Even though they so richly deserve it.

      Speaking of cheating, part of the blah-blah of the argument on Thursday was tbf trying to explain that everyone except "gringos" always kiss on the cheek hello and goodbye, as well as being all touchy-feely.  He got the Peruvian Pizza cooks to agree, but I just figured that "everybody's defending the EVIL man, as usual."  And then today, we ran into two sets of tbf's Latin friends on the street.  Lo and behold.  This.  Behold this.  He kissed each woman on the cheek and touched her exactly like he did the other woman in the pizzeria.  And I'm pretty sure that the women were used to/expected this, as they didn't act surprised or nuthin'.    But I got a laugh when an Argentinian man tried to greet tbf in the traditional way, which is, for men, a kiss on the mouth.  Hee.  Tbf jumped back six feet. Hee.  For a second there, it looked like it was going to get ugly.  Then the second passed.  Oh well.  Tbf explained later that Argentinians have wierd customs.  I got the feeling that Columbians look at Argentinians like we look at the French. Sort of.

      So I asked the class to write about something that bothered them this week.  I wrote about how it felt when I saw the boyfriend walk into a pizzeria with a woman.  He kept touching her arm, didn't bother to introduce us, and kissed her goodbye.  Then she ran out of the shop, looking at me strangely.  Well, I was glaring at her.  Like I wanted her dead.  Which I did.  When I asked the bf "who was that woman?"  He answered, very good, and then turned to the cook and said, please call the police, because I'm about to get murdered.  Hah!  Hah!  Very funny, Mr. short-with-the-elephant-ears!  So we had a big fight. She was nobody, just a friend, you're cheating on me, no I'm not, you're a big liar, no I'm not, you're evil, no I'm not, I hate you, yes I do, please call the police, no I'm serious, Christine, take a seat, no really, don't touch me, blah, blah, blah.  Etc.    Man, I hate not being able to trust.  And then, I hate dating someone I can't trust.  And I hate stupid emotional crisises.  Really I do.  Yet.  I can't. Avoid. Them.

      Funny, I gave everyone the words in a bag exercise (where there are a bunch of random words in a bag, and you have to choose a certain number and make a poem), and the class finished before I did.  I couldn't get past "rub your cinnamon genitals against my toilet, Nightmare house."  Of course I got the word genitals.  Of course. I should have known when I put it in the bag, I would pick that word. Along with the word, rub.

      I just finished my first poetry class.  Whew.  Deep sigh.  Glad that's over.  I was very tense, but then I got more relaxed as class went on.  Ms. Babson was a great help.  I asked her to call me boss lady, but no go.  Instead, she offered to call me "professoressa" which is female professor in Italian.  I did a couple exercises with the class; I think they went down okay.  I think the first day will be the hardest, because we were just getting to know each other.  I could tell the students other than Anne (there were two of them) felt sort of awkward and intimidated.  One woman I'd never seen before, and I was worried she felt left out, since the rest of us were talking like old chums.    Well, I can't make everyone happy!  Can I?  I feel like mothering everyone, and giving them wrapped up treats and taking them gently by the hand and saying, "it will all be okay. It will."  I think everyone liked the work booklet I put together.  At least, I like it.  I think it's very helpful to people who are interested in poetry.  Contemporary poetry, at least.

I keep thinking, "I'm out of control!  I'm insane!" and then I double check and think, "no, most people would get very angry if they totally prepped for the GRE and worried and anxietized and all that, and then were denied, shall we say, fullfiment?  The climax?"  I think that would upset anyone.   Feelings are odd.   I'm half tempted to dispose of them again.

      So, spent most of today trembling with rage and freaking out.  After staying up all night studying for the GRE, I was told, right before the test began, that I couldn't take it because I didn't have the right ID.  Last week I called the testing center and told them about losing all my ID, etc. in a cab, and after much hemming and hawing, they said they could use my work ID.  When I showed up today, they had changed their minds, and denied that we ever had that conversation.  So not only do I not get to take the test, but I lose the money I spent on registering for the test.  I want to take Prometic to court, yes I do.  Just because they're extremely stupid.  Another lesson is why one should fall the spirit of the law and not it's letter.  They knew it was me trying to take the test; they didn't think someone else was trying to impersonate me and take the test for me.  They just lost sight of the goal.  They gave me a number to call, told me I should have called ETS instead of GRE last week to get the okay.  I called the number and discovered that ETS and GRE are the same.  I want Judge Judy!  To quote that awful blonde Gabriel on Xena!  Warrrior Princess!  "I want vengence!"

      Rewrite:  the other side of the room  All Sunday I heard it. A sussurant whisper; hundreds of grasshopper  wings whirring. In my wifebeater and chains, I leaned  out my window on Flatbush Avenue and saw nothing. No feathered Sunday hats, no locked bicycles dissolving into rust, no candles and wreathes. And the sound stopped. I slouched to my kitchen  where roaches twitched on their backs like hot black commas. I tucked a rag green with smears into the handle on the oven door while over the stove the mirror,  ragged with fingerprints, reflected nothing.  I sat down on my velvet couch and it shredded to dust. Then the stove exploded,  silently like snow  and the sun traced figures in the sand, everywhere.  Everywhere, sand. The insects flew faster. Behind me a wave of green and blue wings nearly crashed. I stood near the ocean, some wide pink and blue ocean and it was almost quiet,  with that hush between tides. I opened my palm to read and a flower bloomed there, slowly, but quick, with large white petals which were the white petals of my heart.

      So today was good news. I am! too! enthusiastic!  First off, I found out that I was short-listed for the Alsop's Review poetry prize.  This is very  big  deal.  To the few amount of people who know what I'm talking about.  Then the editor of Alsop's  asked  me, asked  me ,  asked me  (I feel like a Benny Hill sketch: What's that in the  road  ahead?  What that in the road, a  head ?) if he could publish the poem that had almost won.  Uh,  Yeah.   Alsop's Octavo Quarterly, where my poem is going to be published, has also published Kim Addonzio and Dorriane Laux, both of whom I just started liking a few months ago when I was looking for interesting poems for my class.  So this is in the  plus  category.   And, furthermore, meanwhile, back at the ranch, later that same day: Sex and Guts accepted one of my pieces, and the editor said my work, "broke [his] heart."  Heh.

       Girlfriends   There's a shameful secret my friend told me once (I think  she was a little drunk).  We were having lunch at the Mexican-slash-Chinese place one of those times when our boss wouldn't miss us.  She turned her delicate head away and looked at something vague across the room.  She said that's what she thinks  about all the time, getting it from two men at once from behind and from in front, and she must be crazy, is she crazy?  I was silent --  I left her alone for that moment; figuring out how I could be one of those men.

      Yeah, I'm sorry I've been so remiss at updating.  I've been writing and painting alot, and just generally losing my mind over my lack of employment situation.  Seriously.  I'm showing all the tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's.  I'm just about to start accusing people of stealing the things i misplace.  like my glasses.

      New Fiction!  as inspired by a class assignment.   Born to be Wild   Or anything by AC/DC.  Especially  Hell’s Bells  on the radio in my boyfriend’s recycled pick-up, parked under the live oak behind the stable, almost hidden, before my riding lessons, and me going down on him like I did every day, sometimes twice a day.  I sucked his cock so much I dislocated my jaw.  It seems like it was just that summer but it was always summer in California, except for maybe a couple months, so I think it was longer than just summer, I think it went on for a long time.  Sometimes it was his reward for driving me home so I wouldn’t have to take the school bus.  Sometimes I did it because Foreigner’s  Cold as Ice  was playing or maybe something by Styx and we were going down the freeway at night and it was really hot and I’d take off my shirt too and all I could think about was how sexy and porno I would look, if one of my friends could see me.  Once it was with ice cubes because I’d seen that in a movie by Cheech and Chong.   Sometimes it was because the door in my bedroom was half open and my mother was just down the hallway. I thought I was super daring but also maybe so maybe I wanted her to catch me and somehow take me away from all this rescue me from what I was doing all the time.  I couldn’t even take my lunch period anymore without doing it.  Once I couldn’t open my mouth very far because I had a cold sore but he wanted it anyway and he ended up bruised by my teeth.   I tried but I just couldn’t make myself feel sorry and I think I kind of laughed.  He just sort of looked at me and that’s when I knew it was over.  It took me a couple years after that, to really enjoy cock sucking

      I had an art sale Saturday.  Spent all Friday cleaning my apartment, hanging the pictures, putting out candy and selecting the nice art-gallerish music and scents.    Guess how many people came?  One.  At the very end of the day, the darling and talented writer, Ms. Hillary Russ, who bought 3 pieces after I practically shoved them down her throat.  Okay and two neighbors came.  Near the end of the day, I was standing out in the hallway and grabbing anyone who walked by.    After my upstairs neighbors ran by my door, I realized that I had become the annoying single lady with too many cats who asks every one to stop by "just for five minutes" to look at her button collection.  I did see a little of that duck and weave.  I've done it myself.  I can recognize it.

      I hate not being employed.  Makes me depressed.  And so lonely and needy.  I've been calling the boyfriend so many times a day he just turns off his cell.  So I'm pissed off and lonely.

      So... Halloween came and went.  I dressed up in a costume I bought 8 years ago but never wore, put on a new purple wig, made my self-up like a ghoul and then decided to stay home all night.  Well, at least I made half the effort.

      I hate Softskull.  I hate it!  I sent them an excerpt of my poetry manuscript for a book this Tuesday, and I got the rejection today, Friday!  I can't believe they even read the poems.  They sent the rejection out the day they got the manuscript.  They suck.  They're even publishing something else I wrote, as part of an anthology,  The Murdering of Our Years , about artists and their day jobs, and they couldn't even spend one day looking at my poetry.  I'm supposed to go to a Softskull reading this Sunday.  Maybe I'll bring a baseball bat.   Grinding teeth.  Growling.

      I just woke up from the wierdest dream.  It was in China, but simultaneously on the deck of my parents' house out in California, and in some dorm/hotel rooms in hideous beige.  I was visiting a host family in China, who lived on my parents' deck in California, but it was China in the dream.  Everyone spoke English.  Almost everyone in the family was black, not asian.  There was a lot of cooking on the deck, spicy sizzling foods that I could never seem to eat, although I kept lining up to get them.  And the weather was very humid and tropical -- it kept raining suddenly and then stopping.  Vegetables, especially, red and yellow peppers grew very fast everywhere.  Once some huge white goop rained down and got on everything and no one could figure out what it was.  I tried to take a picture of the goop, but my camera just sizzled because it had gotten wet in the storm.  I opened up the back to see if I could fix it, and all these vegetables were growing inside it.  My best friend in the family was very nervous because she was applying to get a scholarship in NYC.  I kept telling her that even if she didn't get this scholarship, she could get another, so not to worry.  Then all the family and neighbors went to a soccer field next door, so they could do hang gliding.  The hang gliders were very queer, like crude paper airplanes, or deriglebles.  The wind was awful so people kept going out of control and having to jump onto the field, sometimes from great heights.  But they continued to go on the rides.

      And so I asked him if he was okay with me and the nude modeling, and he just kind of giggled and said no problem, and then I asked him, okay, sorta' pleaded, if he would actually escort me to the nude modeling just to make sure I wouldn't get, you know, raped, and then he giggled again, and said, didn't I tell you not to quit your job in the first place?  then he suggested I try sending out more resumes.  Okay, really thinking about going and  taking my clothes off in front of a stranger , no matter how many times I've already done that drunk with men that were technically strangers, but just looked really  hot  in my English/Poli Sci/illustration/fiction writing class for at least a whole month and I was sure I had a pretty good grasp of the depth of their souls, I had stared at them for so long... Where was I going with this?  Yes, taking my clothes off in front of a stranger gives me the major willies, and not the kind I'm in the mood to get rid of with a few beers.  So I'm not so wild and wooly, which is quite the disappointment, and I must insist that tbf have sex with me in one of those completely enclosed bathroom stalls on the top floor of the P.S. 1, and not chicken out, like he did last time, complaining that he just couldn't concentrate under those circumstances.  That will prove I'm wild. Yeah.  Who-ho0. hoo.

      Yeah, we got back together.  What, you're surprised.  C'mon the break-up lasted three days.  Last time it was two weeks.  I suppose this is progress.  Anyway, I'm just hoping he doesn't dump me on my birthday.  That's happened to me twice in the past.  My birthday is cursed.  It's the date that all salad dressings and coupons expire.

      Ugh.  I'm so over this weather I'm under it.  I had my third interview for a job last week and I'm just  waiting  for them to call me!  I want a job!  I do, really.  I'm tired of feeling bluish and sleeping all day and being afraid to go outside because I'm afraid I'll spend money.  I'm considering modeling nude for a photo shoot (it's $90!) but I don't know quite how to break it to tbf.  He's kind of wierdly jealous already.  He keeps talking about my other boyfriend, who I keep telling him is just my cat, so hardly a threat.

       Red   I don’t think I’ve fucked anyone with eyes  quite as blue as yours.  They remind me of my brother’s sweatshirt when he was, that indigo that matched his eyes -- he had long black hair, blue eyes and braces. Every week with a different girl.   When he was 15 the sky was a harsh blue that summer we lost him, he was lost.  His eyes weren’t blue after that. Not like yours. Your blue eyes are like the sky that day he was found. Not ever, really, was he.  Your eyes don’t blink do they. A girl could get lost in all that blue.

       Lost California   You miss the blondes. They were everywhere, every shade,  like the sunlight everywhere, glinting off sunglasses and shining off teeth and hair that hair miles and miles of hair hair with rippling waves wheat colored  Hair in the wind as the blondes stand up through the sunroofs of their cars while the other blondes drive down the freeway.  You miss the freeways. That was when you liked to drive. Driving with your long blond hair through those sweet blond hills driving with the hot wind and the sound of the grass.  Your left shoulder getting burned because you always prop your elbow on the open window and steer casually with finger.  You miss how the wind would pull your skirt  up your thighs when you drove.  You miss driving the same streets nowhere over and over again  and seeing the same hills with the same round oaks over and over again under the same sun.  The same smell of smoke, grass and sunscreen.  You miss that smell and that drive, that drive that never ended in California

       The Underneath  I keep a pet  woman under my bed.   She’s small  and feisty, with sharp teeth.   I make her  wear all the clothes  I hate; high heels, garter belts, clingy velour.   I feed her chocolate and wine from a box.  She glares at me  as she twirls the curling iron through her brown hair.   I let her out once a week  for a bubble bath.   When she’s PMSing  she kicks the bottom of my mattress  to keep me awake.  I punish her  by taking away her cable.   She pouts,  spends all day looking at her mirror  instead of me.  I get her a fist sized disco ball: we kiss and make up.   She’s so small  I can fit my tongue  all the way around her neck.   She tastes of vinegar and honey.   When she’s been good I let her sleep  at the foot of my bed.  Sometimes  I wake up  and she’s in my mouth.   I chew her  hair softly, like a cow would,   if it had the heart of a wolf.   Then I put her back in her cage.  She cries and dresses  in white  until the moon breaks.

       Joy School  	 for Joseph Cornell   Why is it that when people speak of joy or paint its substance the canvas is a vast blue sky or an acre of snow broken maybe by a few black boughs.  My joy teaches me small. It is tiny and dark with delicate moving parts in the shadows,  like the ripple of a salmon gill under the river or a small vintage machine  with obscure purpose and many tinny whirrings.  My joy is not made in the huge bright handclap of God.  It is made by tiny mice paws in the mud.  It is made of straw and teeth, with a few white feathers.

      Hey!  Miss me?  My internet connection has been down for a month.  I had a great reading at Mod and am trying to convince a band to let me open for them, again.  They want to do some spoken word thing, which I don't quite understand.  But hey, as long as I don't have to sing...    And the boyfriend's back.  As many predicted.  I still haven't quite forgiven him for the last breakup.  My cats are trading a cold amongst themselves, occassionally they pass it to me.  Like now.    I have more writing. Will post.

       Once apon a time  Mother was a fistful of sticks propped in a corner. To steal her hard tiny face she had broken Mona’s kewpie doll. When we were hungry we slept. While we slept our hair grew into one dark pillow. Spiders built and lost kingdoms in our hair. Once a month our mother caught fire and beat us to put her out. The sparks got in our eyes and we would cry while she hit us, rubbing our dirty lids with dirty fists and hiding behind our faded blue hoop skirts. She lay whimpering for days on the floor with her eyes rolled up. She wouldn’t move when we poked her. In our dreams she was made of cotton and many-tiered cakes. We were always hungry. We learned to chew twigs and each other’s hair. Sometimes, when she slept, we broke off bits of her and made soup. The next day our vomit was black. The boys eventually got tired and wandered off. The girls stayed longer. Some of us are still home with mother.

      this is one I sort of stole, it's kinda' like a found poem, I reworked   Graduation   Phil and Jonnie and I used to push our boat  and its engine about as big as my fist through the back swamps of Lake Lagunita,  shooting guns,  drinking beer stolen from our parents. Sometimes two of us would stand in the shallows,  scum around our knees, holding a cotton rope fastened to the back of the boat,  and Phil would drag us around the lake. I got blisters and rope burns, skinned my knees on floating things. Jonnie squealed dolphin noises,  sometimes made it up to his feet,  walked on water.  Jonnie got in a wreck  the other day, some girl was driving on good old Red Ridge road, the road we used to take to 7-11 to sneak a few  more smokes before going back, back to what was home, what we called home, then.  The girl was wasted, so drunk she couldn’t stop  talking about the blood and her hair said the cops. Jonnie was thrown out the back window of the truck.  broken jaw, broken clavicle, broken  wrist,  possible  high femur fracture, punctured lung; other things inside flattened or gone.   I haven’t visited him yet at the hospital.  I can’t see it-- flying out the back window of a truck. I’ve had to break into mine  when I locked the keys inside, cut my arm on the glass. Squeezing through that  small window is impossible: I’m telling you.

      New poem to celebrate the working blog.  Oh yeah.    The General   for Henry Darger   Little girls, everywhere, tearing, ripping, soiling their pink frocks, turning into snails. They run from this side of the page to that, stepping on their oversized butterfly wings, squealing.  Pursued by huge poppies or red -faced soliders, they shriek and squeal and laugh and hang.  Little girls, everywhere, their purple faces, dying, naked chests full of punctuation and watercolor, with their candy corn and bayonets.  Little girls, everywhere, colored like angels or ducklings, the daughters of a bearded god with hands and eyes constantly tracing little girls, his mouth full of hearts and swords, full of little girls, everywhere.

      Hey, if anyone is still reading this blog (and I know there aren't many of you) you might have seen a piece here recently called Part A....   This was not written by me, it was written by Tricia Warden.   I've been using this blog to format work before I put it into my zine, 13 Feet.  Unfortunately, the delete function didn't work and the piece stayed up after I transferred it to my zine.  Doubly and triply unfortunately, Tricia's name was not with the piece.  So I owe her massive apology and well, should probably go to jail.  Anyway, if you ever see anything here that does not have a little intro like I usually put in front of my work (i.e.; look at my new poem, isn't it shiny) it is probably not mine.

      New poem that I wrote all by myself.   the galloping typist    We rehearse our colors each night, hoping that in sunlight they will not disappoint us  as did our other children.  Then each day is born gray. The sun rises like a small balloon.  A cubicle. We wait.  The bald electrics drain pink from our knuckles. We blink several times. Kisses everywhere flop and expire like valium moths.  We stumble home, eyelashes caught in a button hole.  Fall onto a couch of dinge dreaming small dreams with our eyes open-- narratives of chapped lips-- the wrong mascara next to the  toothbrush cup on the sink, the wrong face in the mirror, the elastic that pinches, a broken colored bulb.  Morning -- that 20 watt bulb. Maybe we see it again beside us.  We have tried  when the room is empty to xerox ourselves to see some sign and felt somehow diminished as if two is less than one  See, I'm trying to be T.S. Eliot, but, uh, not so learned.  Did you see it?

      The Reading was a success!  Everyone who read was really talented, and the audience responded well to my poems, despite the fact the mic was at really awkward angle and I had to speak out of the corner of my mouth and turn my head sideways to be able to read my poems.  Unfortunately, I didn't get anyone's last name that I read with, so I can't pimp them here.   I also got a new writing gig with Duponis, which is a art crit site, opening in September.  I wrote an essay about writing as therapy.

      RE-write  Diary of a Thief   In college, I was skinny  and small, wore too many clothes,  bit my fingernails and fucked anyone  who asked.   Excused from my glass house for the first time, I replaced  again and again and again the small  things, the feathers and the colors,  that had been broken inside me.   I loved to trespass: anywhere  that was easy to enter and forbidden, loved to barely  touch what wasn't mine, loved to pretend this was my place.   When I wasn’t drinking or fucking some boy who smelled  like all the others, I lived in our school library --a miniature cathedral  of dark, sweet smelling wood, a church absent God,  the angels books, helpless, blind and flat, easily torn.   One Saturday night, I crammed myself into the book  elevator and sent me, now a blinded angel, too,  up to the 6th floor, behind locked doors and bars.  A famous poet, you would know his name, had gone to my college and  behind the chain-link fence rested the only copy of his thesis.   I took it down with me.  The paper like baby skin, transparent, elusive,  pages fed through a manual typewriter in the days of carbon paper.   I took  his manuscript, also considering the Durer etching, the Degas sculpture, the signed Dickinson letters: the rare things we hide  because some objects shimmer so  they melt in sunlight or with too much viewing.   I took that thesis  and I touched it, the hand drawn illustrations, the naive anthropological  assertions, the poet's embarrassed youth and misspellings.   I kept it with my books on a darkened desk for a week, imagining  the thousands it could get me or how to take it to my  breast and suckle it, make it  a part of me and my own, seeing the shine  around my head from having such a valuable thing.   Then I put it back.   For years I have done this,  the forbidden, the trespass, and the baroque plans  with things that seem to be suddenly  mine. And for years I have only touched  and returned.   At times I have regretted the things caressed and left behind,  the Vonnegut drawings, the Monets.   But this last spring I finally saw it as a talent:  I can enter a space as private as the chamber of a heart,  uncover without stripping what shines and is hidden,  touch without a need to mold it to the shape of my fist  or mouth. I can return it unbroken, give back what belongs.   And it was spring  when it finally hit me:  now I can be a mother.

      A TRUE STORY  When I was in college, I was skinny and small, wore too many clothes,  bit my fingernails and had sex all the time.  I loved to trespass: anywhere that was easy to enter and forbidden, loved to barely touch what wasn't mine, loved to pretend this was my place.  Our school library was old and gothic. Shaped  like a minature cathedral of dark, sweet smelling wood, but there was no God, and the angels were books, helpless, blind and flat, easily torn.  I knew every corner. Where the red spiders congregated on the south tower, the desk on the fourth floor with the broken lamp, where I could store books without checking them out. They were never moved. The librarians were stoned and indifferent, or too involved in protesting apertheid to care.  With a random boyfriend's help, I crammed myself into the book elevator and sent me, now a blinded angel, too, up to the 6th floor, behind locked doors and bars.  A famous poet, you would know his name, went  to my college, and there was the only copy of his thesis up there and I took it down with me.  It was on onion paper like baby skin, transparent, elusive, made by a manual typewriter in the days of carbon paper.  I took his manuscript, leaving the valuable paintings, the durere etchings, the sculptures and shining valuables, the rare things people and schools hide because some objects mean so much they melt in sunlight or with too much viewing.  They burn with use and  therefore are hidden and visited in memory only.  I took that collection of papers and I touched it, the hand drawn illustrations, the naive anthropologic assertions, the poet's embarrassed youth and misspellings.   I put it with my books on the darken desk and I left it there for a week. Imagining how to sell it or how to take it to my own breast and suckle it, make it a part of me and my own. Imaginging the shine I would acquire from such a valuable thing.  Then I put it back.   For years I have done this, the forbidden, the trespass and the plans of fame and money with things that seem to be suddenly mine.  And for years I have only touched and returned.  At times I have regretted the things I caressed and left behind, the Vonnegut drawings, the Monets, the ancient Greek artifacts.  But this last spring I finally saw it as a talent: I can enter and touch a space as private as the  chamber of a heart, and take nothing, leave no mark, possess only in thought, and return all to the owner.  And it was spring when it finally hit me: now I can be a mother.

      Dear Friends, Readers and Indifferents,  After my experience tonight at the Curious Cafe, I have decided I am not fit to be a poet.  Getting the same score as the “mock poet” or sacrificial lamb at the beginning of the slam opened my eyes to the fact that I cannot write, and in fact, should not.  Therefore, this is the last piece of writing you will ever receive from me.  Perhaps more poignantly, tonight  demonstrated to me that I am unfit for human company.  In light of this, I am emigrating to Mexico, where I will sequester myself in the dry and dusty hills and live off grubs and roots.  I plan to spend the majority of my days squatting, naked and filthy, in a corner, where I will rock, mouth nonsense words, and throw ashes on my head.  Please forward all correspondence to:  That Unspeakable Loser 666 Snowball Lane, Hell, Mexico  Thank you for your infinite patience with what has obviously been my plague of words.  So long.  Good bye.  I mean it.  Seriously.  In the meantime, buy my book: www.lulu.com/sharpNpencil

      So I had another reading last night, and despite the fact that I had a bad flu and stumbled over my words, and felt like fainting most of the time, it went smashingly.  It was at Eastside Oral, a series run by the smashing and dirty-mouthed Elise Miller. Everybody loved me!  And especially my stockings -- which read "bitch" over and over again in white gothic script.  So... I guess I will continue to write.  hmmm.  And below, made a little ad to go in the back of BUST magazine.  If I understand correctly, it's only about 300 dollars to run a small black and white one.      The Gorey quote is what someone told me at the reading.  I blushed.

      This is based on a true story.   The Book   It is no longer a secret -- the government has been notified. It towers in stacks to the ceiling. It fills the tub and slops over the edges. It overlaps the stove-- embraces the sink.   In this story, I represent reason.  I arrive minus a pen. The book parts like a sea, spins me back to the bedroom,  to a small cot.  It covers the cot.  It darkens the windows,  like moths, plastered.  The author is unhappy with me. I tell her the book must go. The author is screaming. Her eyes are unnecessarily large.   Lawyers are involved,  I tell her,  The neighbors hear words groaning in the pause between brushing their teeth and turning out the lights.   The hum of electricity no longer  soothes their dreams.   The author shrieks something beyond  the edge of hearing.   Danger,  I tell her,  there is the possibility of fire, of plague, of tiny bright insects.   The author grabs my hair. I am prepared for this: I brought shears. When I am free, I make the call and the undoing begins.   www.lulu.com/sharpNpencil

      I have so neglected you, my little blogger friend.  Here's something to chew on:  The Field Guide to North American Birds  As soon as I learned to walk, my mother took me out of the house in dawdling tours of our neighborhood skies, me barefoot and her in pink tennis shoes: the simple kind that  were popular back then, not good for running.  She was trying to introduce me to birds: the Purple Finch, Red-bellied Woodpecker,  Steller’s Jay, Evening Grosbeak, Northern Cardinal, Mountain Wren, Yellow-throated Warbler -- the seed-eaters, the sap-suckers and those with beaks like knives, the better to pry at shrinking grubs.  Their names were exotic to me full of color, odd vowels and places I had never been --the European Starling. Europe was where princesses were born and where everyone wore red velvet.  Starling sounded like a tiny star, black, who could perch and fly and call in a scream that made me jump.  The White-breasted Nuthatch -- who embarrassed me, yet made me look hard for her in the pine tree  in our backyard.  She was creating them, my mother, as she gave each a name, and explained how different they were from us: lungs that never exhaled in sighs, bones that floated hollow, and hearts that beat a thousand times a minute.  It was on this walk  under telephone wires that wrang with house wrens  I first saw it the envy in my mother’s eyes of things that were free.

      New poem!(not quite sure if the commas are working, innit)  And, by the way, I am on the short list to having a poem accepted by a Sci-fi, fantasy mag, Adromeda in-flight, which PAYS for poetry.  How insane is that?   Territory   Summer around our backyard pool, I sat half in her shadow, the chlorine drying in my shivers,  and held her feet while she lay dark-glassed and silent  in the striped beach chair.    Her ruby toenails were the throats of hummingbirds  her freckles -- constellations foretelling my future  but the ragged patch  on her right foot, where the tan   seemed erased, drew my little girl kisses  because that part, that most naked pale skin, was on my own foot in the same frog-shape  and it was by that mark I knew no matter what she said,  she was my mother.

      Hey, fellow poets, I've finally admitted it -- I'm addicted to the web.  Every day it sucks away 2-3 precious hours, and during the time, I stumble across many interesting writing sites.  I've wanted to share my discoveries with people -- since writing misery (I mean fun) loves company, so I'm trying to start a mailing list, which will be irregular, daily or weekly, depending on my mood.  It will list the poetry sites, contests and furballs (ok, my cat made me type that last one) I come across all the time.  If you are interested, please respond to holdingmytongue@yahoo.com, subject -SIGN UP.  I will probably be mailing the list from a different address however, I'll keep you updated.

      I had the most wonderful Sunday because I got to volunteer for Brendan Lorber (editor of Lungful!) at his fund-raiser for the new issue at the Zinc bar and all sorts of wonderful poets were there and I even got to talk a little to some of them although one woman from my poetry class seemed to be hating me and of course, smacks head, it's because  I'm fat and I make stupid comments in class.   Which explains all my problems yet again.   Speaking of class, Brendan is running this most wonderful at the Poetry Project and I am learning so very much about the New York School and different styles of poetry which do not include rhymes so I don't have to hate them and I am very glad that I did not try to get yet another MA in writing  and instead just opted to take classes at the Poetry Project.  Ye shall see some of the fruits of this class soon.

      Whopee!  I got a whole new format.  The background, which you may be able to see, faintly, if the page is loading right, is the opening page of a book about 17th century nun and poet,  urlLink  Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz.  She was an extraordinary writer and renown wit, until the patriarchy shut her down.  Bad patriarchs, bad.  There's a very good film made about her life, from the 50's or 60's I believe.  Cruz is supposed to have scribbled on this very page.

       For Laur, After College   You are not mostly in my dreams.  For a while, yes, for years,  I sat on your bed counting the crooked places              in the pine branches outside the window while you talked in a room  on the other side of your old house  (carpets worn beyond grey, money taped under the drawers)    Your mother's smile made me wince.                     She was washing the aluminum foil-- again and again -- so German -- hanging it outside on a line to dry.  So now             I dream about darker, more fragrant houses                                 or a beach  with pink waves that knock me, again and again,                  into the warm sand.  Horses everywhere, rolling and                                                     shivering in the surf. When I wake, there's someone there and he washes my dishes,     			feeds my cats.  Look out the window.  There's bright flashing, almost Morse. It's me saying it's safe.  I'm over you.  It's time for you to call.

      I'm still trying to come up with a good "homewrecker" poem to submit to the anthology she's putting together.  For details go to  urlLink  Daphne's site.   Oh, and I finally got something accepted at Exquisite Corpse!  At first I thought they had made a mistake, since I received a rejection from Andre about a month ago.  But they just accepted another piece I submitted last year.  Which I totally forgot about.   Here's another shot -- comments please!    Forensic Adultery  It doesn’t matter: you’re mine you can’t leave  I have your skin -- flaked cells, nail parings snot surreptiously wiped  hair, ear wax, salvia, semen   in this bed we shared the same mites our hemoglobin has met and linked hands I licked your cheek after the razor cut  I’ve never cleaned our sheets blankets towels handiwipes tissues dirty dishes  your vanilla/ganja scent’s in the walls clings to my hair under my fingernails I’ve never washed you’re still here  I can build another you in your absence (of your absence) you can’t leave me I’m telling you I have you  I have all of you right here  the fibers don’t lie.

      Drive  /stop the car/ you said and I pulled to the side I was driving instead of you even though I was 12.  You told my brother to get out get out and he said no sat still for the first time gripped the car seat as if his knuckles could grow roots.  It was the red car or perhaps it was the blue one I rolled down a hill later that year.  Mom turned to you her face red her hair helpless and distraught and you laughed again.  How could you stop? How could any of us, stop?

       To Madame X at my lunch table    You sit across from me.   Everything new is hard but  your face is soft and quiet your smile constantly erasing itself.  Crack us open you'll find the same violet grub.  I too have problems with my eyes with letting people see them. I fear being read. You fear being heard.  I know just how you feel, you  with the wilting lily in your hair. You're afraid the party's over or that it's just started, and everybody but you is in costume.  You want to live on air forget sleep forget the hollow place in the bed beside you forget the dark blue of your blood when you are slicing onions accidentally.  You want the grime in the street to stop calling to you the one-legged man  laying on Avenue A to stop shouting your name.    You look at a bridge and see a series  of "x"s not and not and not and you don't like soda bread or raisins or wine. You want to go to India but your feet will get  dirty.  You don't sleep because your  dreams crab at you.  Get that lizard out of here!  your mother screams   the milk spoiling and your  mouth filling with feathers.  Hold my hand.  I've been there. Here's how it goes:  Spit.  Take a deep breath.   Let yourself slip under.   Red and lime-green climb down your eyelashes and leopards the size of houses sleep.  When they bite  you taste candy.

       Toilets I Have Known   The highlights--  The Plaza:  Where I had high tea.  I slipped on the polished pink marble floor and almost broke my chin on the sink counter.  The attendant stared, then offered a hand towel to someone else.  Zagreb train station: Where I had to pay 50 dinar. The station was cathedral roofed -- white pigeons flew so high above they made constellations.  The ladies was in a corner, holes dug through the floor into soil, stalls without ceilings.  As I squatted I could see wings sweep up into the smokey ether.  331 Alamos Road: Where I grew up.  The “guest” bathroom was the prettiest, black tile floors, wallpaper mimicking gold leaf.  My dad didn’t like me to lock the door, rattled the knob for an hour when I tried.  Crescent Street: Where I live now.  I don’t bother to close the door more than halfway, the tub needs scrubbing, cats wander in and out at will, to check on my progress.  The Island: Where I work.  Smells like bleach, but roaches scramble where the tin walls meet the tile.  I use the handicapped stall since the seat’s so high my feet dangle.  Makes me feel three again, new at this.

      Tinfoil Hat  I visit this lady once a week she is sweet but  most of her is missing she is crazy and she  has to pee a lot every fifteen minutes sometimes  she doesn’t make it to the toilet her shoes stink of urine  Most of her teeth are missing her face is the color of a  Brillo pad she has an eye that looks inward all white  She used to work in a psychiatric hospital the head nurse injected the noisy patients with something that gave them seizures the patients refused to eat and threw shit at  the staff the nurses beat each other on pay day  Once she saw a big big as a black dog patient step on  another’s head grind it she said  then he saw me watching... I looked away pretended not to see  she is almost blind  She still wears her nurse uniform when I visit she says jobs were  hard to find back then most of the buttons are missing  I can  see the scar on her chest from heart surgery and where her  breasts crease into themselves  Sometimes she compliments me  on my dress and I say,  			 thanks, mom.

      Animal Husbandry  The dog tells me that's he leaving me, that he no longer likes sticking his nose in my pussy. This last week he has been slipping his leash after I fall asleep and sucking cock in the backroom at Woody's. He tells me about the glory holes in the bathroom of the New York Public Library. I tell him he's lying, that dogs aren't allowed in the library. I'm having trouble breathing. I sit down on the edge of the bed. I shout, what, so women aren't good enough for you anymore! I remind him of our first date, how he tied me up and we cried all night. Never before had I been threatened with such tenderness, such sincerity. You can't fake that! I scream. I am sobbing. I am not a woman if my dog doesn't want me. I'm a question mark in a skirt.  The dog has his sad puppy-dog eyes on. I've seen him practice this look in the mirror. He asks me not to hate him. He rolls his eyes and whines.  I know that he's already picturing himself out on a walk, leaving me here alone in a room full of condoms and chew toys, some man's hand on his leash. I wonder if it's my scent that he finds so vile. He rests his chin on his crossed paws. It's not that you're fat, he tells me. There's a gland near the base of the skull that regulates it-- this desire, this thing, for bones.

      The Weather in California   I was turning thirteen the way milk turns, becomes thicker, more complicated, fragrant. I saw the man with his mirror and drill in my mouth as a prophet, a broken wiseman who had seen the light and was ever after plagued by a mist of tears.  As his pick slipped off my gums he whispered about the language used in the trenches of World War II, the code no German could break -- Navajo, a language of pauses and sighs, vowels that resonate from the chest, the people on whose land the dentist's office squatted.  He was a man, he knew things. He had been hurt by his daughter and my mother trusted him.  When he said, this time, I think we don't need novocaine, I didn't want to disappoint. I said yes -- a word everyone wanted from me -- I understood that, and when the drill came, with its high thunder in my head, I knew what was expected.  When it was done he saw I was quiet, saw I made no protest. He told me I was good, a good patient, he said.

       Okay, that poem thing below (Forensic Adultery) was more of an excercise.  I got some real stuff I've been working on coming up.

      Marriage &nbsp; My husband wakes me in the middle of the night, asking me about cheeses. Smell this, he says. The doorway outlines him in light  from the kitchen. Is this your cheese? Has it gone bad?  &nbsp; What? I answer. What? &nbsp; I decide to lose all punctuation and  confuse people &nbsp; The next day my husband throws away all the forks, cursing. He knows I'll buy them again, but one bit him on the thumb. &nbsp; The following night, a cat a finger's breadth away watches  my face as I drift offto sleep.  When my eyes close she bites my nose, not gentle, not hard. Her cat breath is sweet  with friskies. My husband snores and ignores her. &nbsp; The forks will take care of him in the morning.

      This is a poem I'm workshopping tomorrow.&nbsp; Some of the text is taken from a children's book, How Deserts Are Made.&nbsp; It's a pseudo found text piece, because I added a lot of my own words. &nbsp;  How Deserts Are Made  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My family lives in a desert house.  There is never enough milk  at the breakfast table.  &nbsp;  The desert poppy has adapted to live  without much.&nbsp; After a storm it bursts  into red flower and dies.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Weather changes the landscape.  Grains of sand blown by the wind carve  the red rock into pillars. These change  shape as the wind changes direction.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My father changes into someone else  every morning. Coral snakes  drape themselves on his tie rack.  &nbsp;  All desert animals must be able to live  with very little.&nbsp; I hear Gila Monsters  shift under my bed. I stop sleeping  in the bottom bunk.  &nbsp;  My mother is silent for days.  She serves bowls of sand for dinner.&nbsp;  She often disappears in the shadows under the porch.  &nbsp;  The kit fox yips outside my window at night.&nbsp;  He sings blue shoe, blue shoe, blue shoe.  It is a sad sound.&nbsp; I often wish I could see  the moon but my father says he hides it.  &nbsp;  A man can survive for a week in the desert  if he knows what to do.  &nbsp;  There are beautiful things here, things that  sting and run away.  &nbsp;  I sit on the lawn at noon and watch  the scorpions gather stones.  They are building a fence around us.  &nbsp;  They need protection.  &nbsp;  I’ve lived twelve years,  never tasted water.

      Daphne Gottlieb, my poetic counter-culture hero, said "OH MY GOD" and "I love it" when she read the cheating dog poem, below.  I think I might as well stop writing now, as it can't get any better than that.

      Yeah, and the lord said mightly, Dead Kitty is... is a misfit at  urlLink the misfit library.   I'm so pleased.    I applied a few months ago and I thought they had already rejected me.  But today they told me I was accepted!  It's a small, select, elite group of trained killers, I mean... it's a bunch of good writers who get together on the web and collaborate and give each other feedback and publish a journal, and stuff.  So far most of the other members seem to be fiction writers.

       My Romance    because they are less angry and more brutal   by night Gustaf ate things that cried softly before dying  he frightened couples by snuffling  at the pink shine of their bedroom windows  not once upon a time but yesterday   in all that time no man  ventured near the angel’s mound  a huge broken shadow spooking cows for 300 years Gustaf guarded the treasure in the hole  one called Gustaf flew out of the whitened north  the precious metals jewels and opiates  moth-like he liked to creep into our village  of coin on the floor and his red eyes sparked angels live longer than us hundreds of years  in daylight the angel circled our forest  pile of treasure  at last his long nose scented a furred hole on a hilltop rubies and precious things  Gustaf spiraled to the entrance  Gustaf shat all over the cave  and made it his own   the angel’s chicken feet felt the unyielding golden stacks  and a linguist…  angels more so than men love gold  of the hole and swept inside the angel slumbered on the gleaming  and glittering   he woke to lick and sniff lovingly   then one night a man did come  he was a criminal

       the parks of New York     on some nights New York smells of              this bench here is the one   the guy (Micheal) was dead   this mitten was lost last winter                near the lake in Prospect Park                 this here button is for the pants that no longer fit her   if by dead you mean still   the idea of eternal everafter              reminds me of  the hanging tree in Washington Square    late in the afternoon under the tree		 he died   this was a bad idea, but she   not all    ice cream is alike  	Hageen Daz does not exist for example    if by death you mean a sort of loss, transformation   he told me he could control the weather it was as if it would never stop raining   the lady at the other end       of the suicide hotline was having lunch   injections are mandatory, it seems, in certain ER’s   serene was a word I could use for the river		 there over by the     broken glass and pigeons   the psychiatrist became afraid and asked me to sit with him   the drought had lasted two years	people were starting to get arrested for watering their lawns   what you break in this life, you pay for  in the next	he said   Astoria park has poor ground cover and is often muddy   he jumped from a bridge   if by dead you mean gave away         everything  and spoke to god   in Brooklyn there is a small fragrant  enclosed triangle of grass         on Sundays music plays there softly   If by dead you mean gone, then yes, dead.
