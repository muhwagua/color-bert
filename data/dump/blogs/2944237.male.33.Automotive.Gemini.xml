      I just got back from a Speedstar concert. I'd never really heard more than a couple of tracks ofd theirs in the past (mostly just the single "Song For You" that's been getting a ton of airplay on  urlLink JJJ  the last few months. I'm sure it can be found on kazaa. I wasn't that impressed with the band as a live act. They rocked pretty hard, but there is just something about the lead singers voice that is offputting.  The doors opened at 8:30, with various support acts playing until midnight when the band came on. I was yawning at 11am, so needless to say I feel completely fucked.  It's 2:30am now...at least I don't have to be up until 8am tommorrow. What the heck am I doing on the Internet then? Clearly it's because I suck.  This morning at work I discovered my local shopping centre offers the opportunity for walkers to use the centre before trading hours commence. I remember the days when people used to get fresh air when they exercised.

      At work earlier today, this old man came in wearing a ripped white shirt with his own black writing adorning the front. The slogan stated on the front "how many NAZI's are there still in the ALP?". For those of you that aren't familiar with Australian politics (ie you are from overseas or were educated through our public education system), the ALP is one of Australia's major political parties. Clearly the man is nuts. I've seen him a few times now, always wearing the same shirt, but today was the first time he spoke to me. I tell him to have a good day, he tells me that "at least the fascists haven't bombed us yet".   i put my second  urlLink The Bens  EP on  urlLink ebay  today. It is currently going at US$26 which is pretty ace.  Be sure to check out the hepcat.tk web board "express". It appears that regular poster eLmoX is interested in getting a webcam purely for the purpose of getting naked and showing his stuff for the 'benefit' of the folk on the board. I like folks who encourage active participation.

      Quite an eventful day from my desk so far today. I finished updating most of my site. Added a new section or two. A damn nice lad who goes by the name of  urlLink Geoff  volunteered to help reformat my web board so it was more in line with the design of the rest of my site. It's all looking very pretty and shiny.  My ebay auction also went through today. I'd bought an  urlLink EP  for $10 australian at a concert a bit over a week ago. Just sold it for US$36. Taking into account the current conversion rates, I believe I am now able to buy myself a yacht. I was smart enough to buy 3 copies of the EP, which means I have another one to  urlLink sell .   I've been going a little Daredevil crazy the last few days. I'd always enjoyed the Daredevil comics when I've read them in the shop, and I quite liked the flick. It kept the spirit of the books quite well. My only complaint was that it should have resonated more emotionally with the viewer. Instead it was just too shallow. It did prompt me to pick up a Daredevil paperback at the comic shop. Collecting issues 16-19 of the current run on the comic, it had some of the most beautiful artwork I've ever seen in a funny book. Really, it was just ace.  I'm enjoying this blogging thing, I must say.

      It appears that the first official hepcat.tk blog is up and running. You'll note that there are flotation devices located underneath each of your chairs. Exists can be found to the left and right of me, as well as at the end of the vehicle.  So, what prompted me to establish a blog? Well, it seems that since I gained the ability to track my visitors to this page, I discovered that I was averaging at least 50 hits a month. I realise this is nothing compared to your average big-ass website, but for hepcat.tk which was designed purely as a place to house my DVD list and a few random links to websites that amuse me, 50 hits a month ain't too bad. I probably should create some form of content. But, where are you people coming from?

      Long time no write. I could chalk it up to the extremely busy life I've been leading of late, but I suspect we all know thats a big, fat, stinking  urlLink lie . Which ordinarily wouldn't bother me, but how could I lie to you constant reader?  If you ever read the original series of books Stephen King wrote that make up THE GREEN MILE, then you may have encountered a small essay he wrote discussing how the series came about. Throughout it, he kept referring to the audience as the "Constant reader". I'd never read a King book in my life, yet apparently I was a "constant reader". So from now on, I'll be calling you a constant reader. And why? It's not out of respect for Stephen King. It's out of respect for the fact that he's made a gajillion dollars and probably owns his own money pit. THAT, I respect.  Yet respect is not something I have for  urlLink GINGER SNAPS . Yes, I found a copy. Honestly, it wasn't all that bad. I can see myself probably watching it again one day. I can't see how it scored so well on the rottentomatoes website, but it was definately worth a watch. I just wish I wasn't eating my fettucine at the same time as watching it. Plus, you'll be happy to note....there were no ginger snaps in the entire film. I was expecting the film to be to  urlLink biscuits  what  urlLink BREAKIN ' was to breakdancing. Oh well, I guess I still have the opportunity to make my ginger biscuit opus.  I never thought it possible, but I consumed way too much chocolate over the weekend. If you squeeze me, you'll find  urlLink chocolate  oozing out of my pores.

      So, there I am. Standing in front of the fridge at the supermarket. All I wanted to do was to buy some  urlLink orange juice . That's all. Nothing more. But there was so much  urlLink choice . Orange juice with added calcium, Orange Juice with added vitamins A,C, and E, Orange Juice with boosted Vitamin C, etc. I shouldn't have to put that much thought into an orange juice purchase should I? It's madness.   What I can't understand is why the orange juice companies can't just work out which nutrients they want to market, and put them all in the one beverage. I know I would most certainly opt for the juice that has the added calcium and vitamins in the one drink rather than one that doesn't. It's working on the two-minute noodle principle. If a company started marketing one minute noodles, then  urlLink Maggi  would go out of business.   I'm always on the lookout for a bargain DVD-wise, so I can often be found checking out the stand with the cheap DVD's at K-Mart. Every so often goodies appear there. There has been one DVD sitting there that simply looked god awful. It'd been there for months and I always assumed I knew why. "Ginger Snaps".    It looked like a pretty generic straight-to-rental kind of affair, made to cash in on the success of the theatrical success Teen Slasher/horror films that've been raking in the cash over the last few years. I was one of the people that saw Scream in the cinemas and attributed to its huge gross. For that I apologise. Recently I'd read on the Internet (it comes on computers now) that Ginger Snaps was actually a decent flick. I refused to believe it.  urlLink Rottentomatoes.com  gave it an  urlLink 89% Fresh  rating. Somethings not quite right here, but it scored a ton of critical praises. I managed to find a copy after actually having to search for the DVD. Will it be any good? Guess I'll have to watch the damn thing.

      It's been over a week since I last wrote. I hoped things wouldn't come to this. Honestly, I feel as though my blog and I want different things from this relationship. I just won't commit to it.  During the week I scored myself a pretty cool  urlLink Spanish Prisoner  poster, which I'm pretty jazzed about. I likey it a lot.    I've been going mad for Coldplay the last few weeks. The single 'Clocks' is pretty awesome. I'm also digging what I've heard by the band Architecture in Helsinki. I might even go as far as spending some of my hard earned cash on it. I never thought it would come to something so drastic.  Over the last two years, I'd gone a little cold on the telly show BUFFY. I'd enjoyed the show quite a bit in the past, but past season 5, the show developed into a pattern of melodrama, poor scripting, and an overall sense that we'd seen the best the show had to offer. But with my recent purchase of a few of the DVD box sets, I'm getting pretty excited about watching the final series thats currently airing on TV. It ends at the conclusion of this season, and I'm kind of curious to see how it wraps. Rumour has it that someone dies at the end of the season. Reports are saying that two versions of the script exists. One with Spike dying, the other featuring the death of Xander. I'm going out on a limb here and I'm going to say that it will be neither of them, and the death will in fact be the character of Willow. Sacrificing herself as a means of appeasing the guilt she has over having killed some folk last season....this is based on someone who hasn't actually been watching the show, so take that as you will.  For some reason, I've been eating a lot of apples this week.

      I was in a car accident last night on the way to see  urlLink Punch Drunk Love . We'd just dropped my sister off at a theatre, and were waiting for an idiot bus driver to stop blocking 3 lanes of traffic. Suddenly, a bump came from behind. I turned around, saw the car, and pulled over to the side. We looked at the cars. Barely a scratch on my bumper. His car was completely damage free. He handed me his car. He was a priest. Guess the big guy was on his side.  My fathers started wearing 3/4 pants. Wierd.  Punch Drunk Love was completely awesome. I didn't like it so much when watching it, but in retrospect, it was pretty damned cool. I just have to find myself a movie poster now I think.      I've developed a minor head cold. Sneezing up a storm. Gone through most of a box of kleenex. Sexy, no?

      While I'm ashamed to admit it, and do tend to tell a lot of people, I have a bit of a  urlLink Gilmore Girls  obsession. I dig the show quite a bit. The writing is smart, and the girls are sassy. Plus I've been a long-time admirer of  urlLink Lauren Graham  ever since I found her doing a stint on  urlLink Newsradio . She is quite seriously  babe of the highest order.  I'm sure I had a point to make. Ah, yes. Yesterday, I went to go see  urlLink Tuck Everlasting  which stars the younger Gilmore Girl, Alexis Bledel. I had no idea what it was about, but hey, it had a Gilmore Girl in it. We bought our ticket and wandered into the theatre. Suddenly, we found ourselves overwhelmed by a pungent dew-like smell.   Ordinarily, this wouldn't bother me too much, but the smell was intense, and recently I've found myself blessed with the sense of super scent. My sense of smell has always been crap, but the last two weeks my nose has been going mad with the smells of the world around me. Which can be a negative when entering the mens restrooms.  We went and got a refund, then bought some pizza and ate it at a lookout which gives you a view of the entire city. The pizza was tasty. The mosquitos that ate me alive up there were not. I scored 13 kills.  It suprises me that no one has ever done a re-mix sampling the  urlLink THE ODD COUPLE  theme song. It could be, as the kids are wont to say "bitchin".

      Two years later and I still don't understand Pokemon. Surely I'm borderline retarded.  I'm a little bit upset that today is the beginning of a new month. It means that I'll have to change my calendar to the new month. Goodbye The Count, hello Big Bird. I kind of miss my  urlLink  Bob Carlos Clarke calendar from last year. It was 12 months of naked women in demeaning positions. But it was all black and white, so it's art.  Apparently  urlLink Michael Moore  is developing his next film at the moment, investigating the connection between the bin laden family and the Bush's. Read about it  urlLink HERE   Yesterday morning I woke up with a dream about the end of the world. I'm standing watching in the distance as a giant mushroom cloud is visible, followed by bursts of lava from the ground. It was when i woke up that I began to hope that I am not a prophet. For morning tea at work, I bought myself a bottle of Sunkist. I drank half of it, then put the rest into the fridge. I return to it at lunch time only to find that someone has marked the bottle with a black felt tip pen and drawn an "x" on it. Clearly it was a sign that someone knows about my dream and it was done as a message to silence me.  So far I'm trying to decide between secret government cabal, or freaky religious sect. I like the idea that maybe the Pope is the mastermind behind this.  Is anyone even reading this? If so, swing by the  urlLink web board  and say howdy.

      How can I keep up the speed at which I'm posting here lately? I'm like a machine.  The 24 season finale has come and gone. Ultimately, it felt kind of ho hum. The final confrontation between Jack Bauer and Kingsley felt completely anti-climactic. Perhaps if he'd been built up into more of a menace, but his introduction simply felt rushed. It was as if the writers had plotted 5 or 6 ace moments in the show, and tried to build 24 episodes around them. It just didn't gel completely.  Meanwhile, the Buffy finale completely rocked my socks off. I haven't been watching the new episodes all that much, but after watching a few of the recent episodes, its dawned on me that I'm missing some good shit.  Phone Booth. If you've seen the trailer, or even just know the premise, you've seen the movie. And that just isn't enough. Hitchcocks REAR WINDOW is similar in that its based on a premise that involves a guy, a killer, and a single location. The difference was that Hitchcocks flick was highly entertaining. There were some great performances, camera work, and just a sense of classiness to the flick. Phone Booth, however, lacked in every respect, and seemed ultimately lifeless and trashy.

      Watch now as I completely geek out. From when I rediscovered the show as it entered its second season, I've always been pretty fond of  urlLink Buffy: The Vampire Slayer . Much like the other shows I tend to watch, it's a show that is driven primarily by the writing. The writing is always pretty sharp. Primarily, I've always enjoyed the comedy aspects of the series first and foremost. Some of the funny is inspired genius. A lot of the comedic references made by the characters are completely unrealistic in terms of the characters that say them, but it's always such a  urlLink money shot , that as a viewer its remarkably easy to forgive.  Yet, for the last two-three seasons, I've developed a lack of interest, and even a minor disdain for the show. It's only been while rewatching the episodes again on DVD that I've begun to realise why I stopped caring. What's gotten me thinking about this is an article published on the Salon website, which you can read by clicking  urlLink HERE . The article lay the blame primarily on the introduction of the character of Spike into the show. Thinking about it, it's become apparent to me that this is only really a surface analysis of the problem with the show. It isn't so much Spike that's the issue, it was the shift of sensibilities in the series that resulted in the show losing its appeal (in my eyes), and it was this shift that allowed Spike to become a prominant player in the show.  When Buffy first began, we met our heroes in high school. Note that I said heroes. The show has never just been about Buffy. She's the focus of the show, and it's seen through her eyes, but the show is ultimately about her gang of friends. Buffy. Xander. Willow. The shows heart has lay with this trio. As the seasons progressed, the show used Buffy's vampire killing/slayer lifestyle as a metaphor for the stages one goes through in ones teenage years and growing into maturity. And for the most part, it was successful. It's been the shows shift away from that which has been the problem for me.  The first three seasons were set in Sunnydale High School, where the week-to-week episodes dealt with a different metaphor. One episode dealt with some students being posessed by some Hyennas, a metaphor for students teaming together with a pack mentality. Another episode  The first major shift away from the characters and manor in which the themes of the show were depicted changed with the outing of Willow as a lesbian. Part of the shows appeal was that the trio were seen, or at least felt, as outsiders at high school. Earshot, an episode at the end of season three (just before their  urlLink graduation ), featured Buffy telling a fellow student that everyone in high school feels alone and distant from the same pain everyone feels. The acknowledgement of this fact by Buffy signals a change in the characters evolution which continues into the next season as they enter College. Throughout the first episode of season four, we see Willow settle into a comfortable life at College. No longer is she the outsider. Instead, she is now being accepted by the college society, a place that respects education and intelligence. Willow represents the change that a person feels when they do leave the cocoon of high school and find that their former awkward self can in fact be an asset in the larger world. Yet this change and evolution in character is perverted by the change midseason where she forms a romantic and sexual relationship with another female student. Willows acceptance at University is ignored, and instead focus shifts to her new lifestyle choice. Again, Willow is made to be an outsider in the show. The lone homosexual character in a series populated with  urlLink straight  characters.   It was mid season five that created the biggest shift in sensibilities. The shift that knocked the entire show off its axis. The death of Joyce Summers, Buffy's mother. Buffy's growth and maturity as a person was always shaped by her life as a slayer. And so, in mid-season five, it seemed that the writers decided that Buffy needed to be seen as developing into her own person. An independent adult. And so, to do this, they killed her mother Joyce. The show which had always served as a metaphor for an average teenage girl was now altered by an event that is rare for most teenage girls of that age, the death of their parent(s).  If the show were to remain true to its initial gameplan, the death should not have been  urlLink Joyce Summers , but instead Giles, Buffy's 'Watcher'. Giles job had been to guide Buffy in her role as a vampire slayer. To kill Giles would be an opportunity to symbolise Buffy's development from teenager to young adult. The loss of the mentor guiding her through life, thereby forcing her to take responsibility for her own path. I understand from a writers point of view why they chose to bump Joyce off. She had always been a dull character, while Giles was hella cool. Yet, the loss of Joyce never felt true to the spirit of the show.  Since then, any metaphorical development of the characters has just felt forced and a little false. It's a shame, because it used to be a hell of a ride.

      For the past year or two, it has been a rarity to find me actually  urlLink glued  to the TV for more than an hour. Increasingly I find there just isn't that much on TV that can keep me watching from show-to-show. I might tune in for the occasional show, but then I'll head off to get online, or read, or continue writing up my plans to stalk/romance  urlLink Samantha Mathis .  Tuesday nights are beginning to change this. Last night I tuned in for  urlLink The Gilmore Girls . I swear the writing on this show is getting better with each season. To the casual observer, it looks like nothing more than a girly  urlLink 7th Heaven  style family program, which it very easily could be. The difference is that the writing on the show is hysterically funny. There's rarely any real plot to speak of in any given episode.   The classic scene from last nights episode involved the Rory and Lorelai Gilmore visiting a Harvard Allumni to get tips on applying to enter Harvard. I almost fell off my couch laughing when after meeting his family, Lorelai repeatedly insinuates that there is an incestuous relationship taking place in the household. Not funny to read in a blog. Hilarious when spoken by the ever so spunky  urlLink Lauren Graham .  Usually this one hour of TV would be the end of my TV watching. Not so. Tuesday nights also herald the greatness that is  urlLink The West Wing . Honestly, the show kind of sucked last year for the first 3/4. But this year I'm falling in love with it again. The writing has steered away from the heavy political nature of season 3 and is returning to what the show did best. Focusing on the humanity of these professionals. I just wish I could understand how the hell the US electoral process works. I've been trying to work it out for years, but all this business with Primaries has me completely bewildered.  I actually sat through an episode of Star trek: Deep Space Nine. Never done that before.

      I'm going to go out and announce this publicly. X2 is not as good as the first film. That said, it still kicked several varying types of ass, and  urlLink Famke Jansen  will soon enough be the Baroness von Lego if I have my way.   Because I'm such a negative Nancy, I'm going to simply focus on the flaws of the flick. I have a communication degree. Criticism is what I do best.   *Not enough screentime for Scott "Cyclops" Summers. For the team leader and someone who should be integral to the story, he's sidelined far too much in this flick.   *The resolution was supposedly epic in scale, but it honestly didn't excite me all that much.   *Patrick Stewart just seems miscast in the role. Sure he's bald, but he just doesn't really seem to do it for me as Prof X.   *For such a large school, why did it only seem like there were a maximum of 12 students studying there?

      Have you ever thought to yourself that it would be great to see a new version of the  urlLink Mod Squad  back on the screens?  No, I didn't think so. Me neither. In fact, that's a horrible idea. And what could make it worse? If one of the characters was given a super power.  Proving that everything old is new again if you throw enough money at the budget is the new  urlLink Jerry Bruckheimer -produced  urlLink FEARLESS . Ever since the guy hit gold with his CSI-shows, the guy seems eager to try to take over television.   If by 2006 every show is produced by either Jerry Bruckheimer or  urlLink Dick Wolf , I would not be suprised. Actually, Law And Order: When Animals Attack XIV could actually be pretty good.  But I digress. Bruckheimer. Shit show. Mod Squad.  Back on track I am.    What's the skinny?  Well, there's this chick who doesn't play well with others. She's an FBI agent who has been assigned to a new task force of three agents who are all young and intended to take down the younger criminals. This means we have a cast of three attractive young adults who're all very cool, groovy people that dress ever so 'street'. But wait, why doesn't she play well with others? Is that because of her secret?  In the most improbable scripting of the last 75 years of television, we discover that she feels detatched from other agents as a result of her being born without the gene that produces fear. Apparently its a gene that makes me scared by those white-faced guys at the Ashtons circus. As the great Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons would be likely to say: Worst plot device EVER!   Who's In It?  Rachel Leigh Cook proves that a career starring on screen with Freddie Prinze Jr can only ever mean that you'll eventually settle for a television gig. While  urlLink Bianca Lawson  (best known as vampire slayer Kendra in Buffy) and  urlLink Eric Balfour  (who has been in recurring roles recently in 24 and  urlLink Six Feet Under )  co-star, bringing the bland delivery that only they could.   Anything decent happen in the first episode?  Not really. We meet all the characters. Rachel Leigh cook does a horrible Jodie Foster/Clarice Starling impersonation for the entire episode. The end.  But is it any good? It's almost completely unwatchable and actually makes you want Michael Cole back on the screen.

      So the television executive says to the other television executive "You know, I'd really like to do a weekly Shakespeare television series"  "That's an excellent idea"  *obviously this second executive works for the first.  "We need a show that will appeal to the young demographic, so I was considering Romeo & Juliet. It'll have two young leads. A romantic plot. We don't have to let them sleep together straight away, we can build the URST up over the first season".  "But sir, we work for Fox".  "Shit. I hadn't thought about that".  "Maybe we can throw in lots of cool editing like jump cuts".  "Will that be enough....wait....sex. We'll add lots of sex.....I'm having a brainwave....Juliets father can work in pornography....he'll be a porn baron. We can be edgy and cutting edge. We'll be proactive and compete with HBO."  "Shall I get Jerry Bruckheimer on the phone?"  "Yes. Immediately".  And so began the creative process for the new Fox series  urlLink SKIN .    So, what's the deal with it?  Featuring two star-crossed virginal lovers, with 90210 style good-looks, and tragic 90210 style acting, Skin focuses on the romance between the son of a District Attorney trying to make a political name for himself by taking down a billion-dollar porn king. Yay for contrivance, because it just so happens that the son has just started a relationship with the porn kings daughter.   In this post-Sopranos TV environment, the US nets are busy trying to emulate the success by developing edgier adult drama. Witness NBC's attempts  urlLink KINGPIN . Comedian Drew Carey mentioned in his Dirty Beer and Jokes that in America only the wealthy are allowed to see pornography and violence. If you can afford cable television, you can view these acts nightly in your own home. Yet, those without a disposable income are only able to watch the free-to-air television shows, where sex and violence is minimal. This show is a testiment to that very belief. Despite all the references to pornography, the show features a complete lack of any nudity at all. Not to say there aren't naked people in it. The show has two-scenes that are supposed to titilate the viewer. But instead, the insistance on covering any glimpse of nuaghtiness completely nullifies it. Anyone who knows me is probably just gunning for the pervert factor to my criticism here, but I feel my point is legitimate. They need to be more clever about the way they're executing this supposedly cutting edge television. If they want to make the show sexy, they need to be smarter about the way they try to seduce the audience. Glimpses of women covering their nipples just isn't really that sexy. It's very bland.   Who's In It?  Well, pretty much no one of note other than Ron Silver, of Heat Vision and Jack fame. The pilot itself was directed by  urlLink Russel Malcahy  of whom directed a few Duran Duran videos and the movie Highlander. The show is produced by Jerry "I make movies with quick edits" Bruckheimer.   So, what happens in the crucial first episode?  Not a heck of a lot. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. Fathers wage war against each other. A strip club is blown up. It sounds much more interesting than it is.   But is it any good?  Not really, no. There's something slightly watchable about it, but mostly, its bland and horrible. It's horrible that gems like F-Troop will stay in a vault somewhere, while shit like this stinks up the airways.  In summary, if Skin was like F-Troop, the Nielson ratings would soar.

      Earlier today I was told that I'm only interested in softcock TV shows. Probably true.  That said, it seems that there are a heck of a lot of TV pilots currenty hitting the Internet at the moment. As a TV nerd with a broadband connection, I feel its my duty to take a look at some of these gems. And non-gems. And by non-gems, I mean anything by Stephen Bochco.  Today I took a gander at the pilot for Mister Sterling. The show isn't new. In fact, I think it was used as a mid-season replacement earlier this year and wasn't picked up for the new season. That said, it still hasn't aired in Australia yet, so I figured I'd take a peek.    What's It About?   Mister Sterling centres on the son of a former senator who is chosen to take over a seat in the senate by a senator who died. So, yes, it's very heavy on the US politics. The show itself could easily be described as what The West Wing would have been like if Aaron Spelling produced it and decided to tone down the sex a little. Mister Sterling was created and produced by  urlLink Lawrence O'Donnell , a former writer on the West Wing. It's a modern day Mister Smith Goes To Washington. The only difference is that Mister Smith goes To Washington never guest starred porn queen Jenna Jameson. Much to its own detriment, I've always felt.    Who's In It?   The cast is filled with a ton of those actors that cause you to spend most of the time trying to work out "where have I seen that dude before?". The show is led by  urlLink Josh Brolin , son of Mister Barbara Streisand: James Brolin. While Josh can never follow in his fathers footsteps by appearing in something as great as  urlLink Pensacola: Wings of Gold . Supporting players involve the former TV-version of Jeff Spicoli  urlLink Dean Cameron ,  urlLink Harris Yulin , and former father figure in Boy Meets World  urlLink William Russ .    So, What happens In That Crucial First Episode?   As you'd expect, Mister Sterling comes to Washington. he meets a few of the wrong people, but he's a smart guy under that all-American facade and eventually works out who he can trust. In the pilot, as Sterling settles into his first day, he mistakenly tells a reporter that he doesn't belong to the Democrat party. A problem in that the party hold a very tight position of power in the Senate. Just one more Republican in the senate means that they get to take power. So what does the Republican party do to keep power? They resort to the very thing that makes America great: bribery.    But is It Any Good?   I quite liked it, but then, I quite like The West Wing, which has been accused of being liberal softcock television. In many ways, this is to the West Wing what shows like High Incident, or The District are to something like NYPD Blue. It's a heck of a lot more featherweight in terms of quality, but it does strive high. The cast don't really click properly in the first episode, but they all have potential. It's just a shame that the show aspires to be higher brow than it ever will be.

      I remember a day when they used to deliver the comedy. Much like Chevy Chase and Dan Ackroyd, they've bought into their own ego and have sunk their cred completely. I'm talking about those that now call themselves members of Working Dog Productions. Many a year ago when they were doing the Late Show, each of those kids brought the funny through both writing and performance. Their next gig Frontline was sharp for the most part and worthy. But everything since has been a great deal of ick.  Yet strangely I still watch the Panel weekly. They're pale shadows of their former selves, losing it more each week. It dawned on me earlier this week what symbolises their fall from grace in my eyes.  Jo Stanley.  I have no idea who she is. She seems to be gradually replacing Kate Langbrook of whom knew how to deliver the occasional laugh. But this Jo chick does nothing. She stays silent for the majority of each episode, speaking once or twice with the most uninspired comment she can conceive at the time, then goes back to her solemness. There's so many talented people out there who could be bringing more to the show than she does, yet they've got her on weekly doing nothing. I'm all for developing new talent, but all she's doing is supplying the new. Back when the guys knew comedy, there's no way they'd have her on air each week.  At least Tony Martin and Mick Molloy still seem to know what they're doing. I enjoyed Molloy's directorial debut Crackerjack a heck of a lot. And I have complete faith that Tony Martins debut flick Bad Eggs will be inspired when its released in July.  If only we could find out whatever happened to Jason Stephens.

      Celebrity birthdays for the  urlLink 17 June  include:   Greg Kinnear (former host of E!'s Talk Soup) Thomas Haden Church (Ned from Ned & Stacey) Mark Linn-Baker (Larry from perfect Strangers)  So, needless to say, I'm in good company for my birhday celebrations. And I use the word 'celebrations' loosely. See, as a cranky old fart, I tend to hate my birthdays. Sure, I dig the whole gift giving aspect of it, but beyond that they leave me kind of cold. How then did I celebrate my entry into my 23rd year of life?  I cleaned my room up a little. Went to the market. Then went and saw the movie Secretary at the cinemas.   urlLink Epic , no?  I enjoyed the heck out of the movie  urlLink Secretary . It's an S&M romantic comedy of sorts. I was concerned that the S&M aspects of the movie would feel forced, especially as much of the film is centered in a lawyers office. Thankfully, it was all depicted rather naturally and evolved very nicely. Which is why I felt the ending was a little disappointing. The climax has the main character Lee confessing her love for her boss, of whom orders her to sit at his desk with her palms flat on it, and not to move her feet. She is left in this position for several days. Now, this fit in fine with the movie, except they then have a dopey scene where the media have discovered this and are depicting her as being on a hunger strike for love. The media aspect only goes for a minute or two, but it completely destroyed the natural and personal nature of the story. 'twas disappointing after it had been developed so nicely.  I'm also very much in love now with the lovely Maggie Gyllenhal.     But now for the shallow part of this blog posting, where I list some of the cool stuff I got for my birthday. I got a few pairs of socks, a CD Burner (after mine crapped itself a few weeks back), Glamorama by Brett Easton Ellis, and a stack of DVD's (Spirited Away, Angel Season 2, The French Connection, X-Men 1.5, The Animatrix, Predator, The Conversation, Misery, Vanilla Sky, The Bourne Identity, Crackerjack, and Seven). All in all, none too shabby.

      As the great philosopher  urlLink Madonna  once uttered "This used to be my playground". A wise woman she is. These finely crafted words of  urlLink wisdom  echoed through my mind today as I wandered the urban commerce landscape that is the city today. My quest: to buy DVD's.   Since I finished uni a few months back, the regularity of my being in the city has changed from approximately 5 times a week to once every few months. As I wandered around, everything had changed. My  urlLink hood  was no longer. It felt empty and lacked soul. I would have wept, had I not been able to buy  urlLink Josie & The Pussycats  for $12.50. What an absolute bargain for a slightly better than mediocre flick.  For another $70, I scored the Planet of The Apes box set of the five films. While they're ace flicks, it made me realise something. As a young man in his teens, I used to watch a heck of a lot of sci-fi and fantasy movies and TV shows. These days I've become a great deal more pretentious and tend to watch more art-housey stuff. Is it simply because there isn't any good sci-fi/fantasy being made lately, or have I changed as a person? Something to ponder. Or not.     Watching channel Nine tonight, I've had two thoughts: 1) The opening credits to the 1983 film Frantic are completely awesome. 2)I shudder when I consider that the brother of John Belushi could have agreed to be in Curly Sue.   SHOE MONEY TONIGHT!!!!

      Next week I have a birthday coming up. I'll be a  urlLink big  23 year old. And so, considering its my birthday, I've been thinking about the other end of this big 'ole spectrum: Death. And more importantly, funerals. Should I ever be bumped off in the near future (be it by the mob, or an enraged spurned lover), I have a few requests for my funeral.  1) I want a bouncer at my funeral. The purpose of whom will be to keep all the ugly people out. This is my moment where people are fully focused on me. I've never had much tolerance for the ugly in my life, why should it be any different in death? I'm a shallow man, and I want my funeral to reflect this.  2) Music-wise. There's only one band ever to grace Gods green earth that is worthy enough to have their tunes played at my funeral.  urlLink Dr Teeth And The Electric Mayhem . What could be more fitting than the stirring tunes of "manah ma na" being played as my coffin is laid to rest?  3) Never do I wear a suit. Therefore, why should I be buried in one for all eternity? Put me in a pair of jeans, a shabby shirt, and preferably, no shoes. On a side note, do you think many nudists are buried in clothes? Food for thought.  Funerals just aren't personalised enough, in my opinion.

      I've said it before, and I'll say it again, snails are just lazy slackers.  After a week or so of being down, hepcat.tk is back on the air, serving you the minimalist content you've come to expect from this poorly designed waste of webspace. The reason for the downtime lays with my change of ISP's. I've now switched to an ISP that is cheaper, has horrible advertising during Wheel of Fortune, but offers me unlimited downloads. Which is awesome as I'm itching to download as much as humanly possible. Thus begins the "60 Gigs of June".

      It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine. Well, actually, that's not true. It's more of a hopeful nervous trepidation. For the last four years on television (three actually, in Australia), hidden amongst the trite aussie dramas, home renovation shows, and multiple Law and Order clones, was a television show that did things a little differently. I like to call it close to perfection, others call it The West Wing.  But alas, the greatness of the show is very close to its end. After a very public series of disputes between  urlLink Warner Bros  and  urlLink Aaron Sorkin , Sorkin has opted to leave the series that he created and had a hand in writing the majority of its episodes. So, what now for the show? With a new writing team, and a showrunner, The West Wing is going to be facing some major changes. I actually have a lot of faith in  urlLink John Wells . He developed and produced ER during its first two seasons, which were the high point of the show before it slipped into soap-ish melodrama and implausability. Plus he (or in the very least his secretary) replied to a letter I wrote to him back in ER's early days. And that was mighty nice of them. The simple fact is that despite the fact he's a good showrunner, he doesn't have Sorkin writing for the show.  The West Wing is very much Aaron Sorkin. I've never met the guy, but I do believe in the auteur-principle, and if you watch enough of an artists work, you begin to learn quite a lot about who they are and what they bring to the table. Sorkins scripts brought with him not only the standard political storylines that one might expect from a show such as this, but he also brought with him a very specific tone to his dramatic and comedic moments. Honestly, it's hard to really clarify what the tone is, and its very easy to simply classify it as being Sorkin-esque, but ultimately its simply that his characters are highly intelligent in their thoughts, dialogue, and actions. Sure, they do come off often as being pretentious as hell with no realisation of just how they are, but that is what gives them there charm in a way. It is rare to find a character in a Sorkin series of minimal intelligence.   The plots on The West Wing next year will probably continue in similar fashion to the way they have all along. Yet, the show will not be the same. The show will at times be sexier and probably more exciting for the most part, but it will miss the moments that are the most crucial to the show. These are the moments where the characters have something thoughtful to say or do, and when they do this, television doesn't become any finer than this.  Until Sorkin gets his next show up and running, television is going to be missing a great deal of mind and soul. Enjoy the last episodes of season four as they air on channel Nine over the next few weeks and appreciate them for their intelligence.

      After far too long, the movie Confessions of A Dangerous Mind was released in cinemas in Australia yesterday. You can order it on the DVD that will be released in just a little over 5 weeks time  urlLink HERE . So, after months of it being anticipated by me, was it actually any good? Golly gosh yes. But what does this have to do with TV? After all, this is generally a TV-focussed blog.  The most notable thing about the film is that it was directed by former TV heart throb  urlLink George Clooney . Now, if you're anything like me, you're probably wondering why George Clooney is referred to often as a heart throb, while the same courtesy isn't extended to the very sexy Fyvish Finkel. But I digress. Clooney started out on some lame sitcoms, then ended up making a name for himself on ER. The pretty boy then opted to do a Caruso and pursue a movie career. It was then that he fell in with a bad crowd, with the likes of  urlLink Steven Soderbergh , and began to star in art-pop films. Clearly he's learnt a thing or two from Soderbergh, because Clooney goes completely to town visually with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.  Further TV connections come from the films screenwriter  urlLink Charlie Kaufman , well known for his work on Being John Malkovich, and Adaptation, but lesser known for his sitcom work, including the short-lived  urlLink Ned & Stacey . The sitcom, as you may recall, was a worthy watch if only for the comedic chops of its cast, with offbeat scripts that meant the show was doomed to fail.  Ultimately, what makes it a TV film is that its all about Gong Show host and creator  urlLink Chuck Barris . While no one actually believes him, the creator of the game shows The Gong Show, The Dating Show, and The Newlywed Show, also claims to have been hired by the CIA as an independent contractor to perform the occasional hit. It almost makes you wonder what Merv Griffin was up to.  So, as the great Molly Meldrum has been known to say, do yourself a favour and check it out. It's goofy, wild, and damn well shot. Plus a lot of the male characters wear really cool hats. And as we all know, cool hats make for great movies.  (yet strangely not good TV shows, as  urlLink The Hat Squad  has proven)

      Sure, I was in Byron Bay for some of that  urlLink Splendour In The Grass  action, but it doesn't mean that I didn't get in the very least my daily 3 hours worth of pre-req telly.  Sure, Coldplay were awesome, but were they really as awesome as the Romeo & Juliet ballet that the ABC had on yesterday afternoon? That ballet had the biggest cod pieces I've ever seen a male dancer yield. Truly creepy.  The Living End were amazing, but did they compare to Bert this morning cooking with Dorinda, suspiscious that no one was actually watching the show?  The Cassanovas were a bunch of fun, but could they even dream of matching the awesomeness of channel 7's screening of Mickey Blue Eyes last night?  Okay, maybe scratch that last one.Oh, television, you are my joy.  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   The two highlights for me at the gig were Coldplay and The Living End. Both were completely awesome and had the audience eating out of their hands. It was insane how great their stage presense was. While the audience were all pretty eager for Coldplay, they were much more feverent for Powderfinger it seemed. I've never been that much into Powderfinger, and I must say that they weren't brilliant on stage. They sounded great, but they just don't seem to have much of a connection with the audience. But maybe it's just me.  It should also be noted that while Bernie from Powderfinger complained of being ill and didn't do an encore, Chris Martin from Coldplay was going insane at the piano during his encore, even with what looked to be a mild injury from an  urlLink altercation  that day. What a dude.  I spotted Gwynneth Paltrow off to the side of the main stage while Coldplay were on. I considered stalking her at Byron, but there were things to do, scones to eat.  Scones. The hardcore food of any festival attendee.

      I'ts been just shy of a week since I updated the blog here. I'll try to get some more stuff up here in the next few days, but it's been a bit busy at the Ponderosa here. Been busy buying up on the  urlLink Mr T board games .   The big event that's ruling my world is the release of the Tony Martin comedy Bad Eggs next week. I've been a big fan of Tony since his Late Show days and have been eager to see what kind of film he'd put together. His Late Show co-horts had already gotten into the film biz a few years back, and it seemed odd that Tony, a film geek, hadn't wet his toes in it yet. But now, Bad Eggs is here, its out, and its proud. Folks who stop by the board may have read  urlLink this  fine post by "Adam"....if that is his real name. It's a great report from the opening of the flick, and I encourage y'all to take a read. Adam's also available for studding incidently, if interested, drop me an email.  I have two or three more pilot reviews I want to get done. It's just that I'm about to scrape the bottom of the barrell, and I can see lots of gunk down there like Tarzan and Jane, The OC, and there's some sort of really dirty looking Joan of Arcadia series which looks like it may by good christian television. *shudder* And so, once I'm done with them, it'll be time for me to knuckle down and actually try to find a real focus for this blog. One that hopefully doesn't simply involve me writing thousands of words about why Rove is the anti-christ.

      People often criticise the US television stations for buying the rights to British comedy series and remaking them. But the way I see it, it could be worse. Consider Are You Being Served In Australia.  Doesn't seem so bad, does it?  The problem is that when you're taking a comedy from one country to another, the comedy stylings just don't quite work. Note the current US remake of the show Coupling. And it's a shame, because the remake almost works. Almost.   So, what's the deal?  Well, it's exactly the same as the UK version. There's a few alterations to the script, but most of the dialogue and scenes from the first episode of the UK version are redone with US accents. The script is even credited to the writer of the UK version, Stephen Moffat. And, honestly, some of the rewrites actually work much better than the original episode. For those of you who don't know, the show revolves around a couple starting a relationship, their two best friends, and their ex-partners. It's just like Friends, except with lots of smut. Oh, and it's funny.   Who's In It?  Basically, its a big bunch of unknowns. The only cast member I recognised was Rena Sofer (who had a semi-recurring role in Ed). The show runner is former Cheers writer Phoef Sutton. It's a shame that the damn thing wasn't casted better as that's where the fault lies completely. Rena delivers her lines satisfactrily, but the other actors have no idea what to do. Their hands gesture wildly, and its almost like watching a sitcom from the early 50's where it was treated akin to a stage show. It causes the series to come off highly ameteurish.   So, what happens in the crucial first episode?  Well, we meet everyone. Steve meets Susan, and the rest all sort of interact in the background. It culminates in a resturant where they all watch Susan show them her right breast.   But is it any good?  Not really. I quite like the UK series for all of its faults, which I think has to do with a reasonably charismatic cast. The US casting has been horrible. NBC are looking at the series to work as a replacement for Friends when that concludes its run at the end of the next season. Part of the success of Friends was that the ensemble all clicked together relatively well. The pilot is worth a watch if only for a lesson in how to almost succeed in remaking a series.

      I've always wondered how I'd spend my time should I ever develop invisible powers or become a ghost. I suspect I'd spend a lot of time loitering in womens showers or perhaps catching a free movie at the cinemas. Really, what else would there be to do? Nothing fun at least. The worst thing possible would be to be forced into getting a job. Which is exactly what happens in the television series Dead Like Me, a wickedly funny new telly series thats just started airing in the US on the cable station Showtime.   So, what's The Deal?  George (A female....because it's cool to give girls boys names in TV shows) believes that its best not to become too interested in things, because it will save from being disappointed. She's directionless in life with trouble connecting to her family and former friends. Not that this is necessarily a problem for her considering that on her lunchbreak during her first day at work, she finds herself being killed by a a piece of debris falling from a downed russian satelite (a zero gravity toilet no less). So, after discovering the afterlife, she is made a grim reaper.    Who's In It?  The show is headed up by 22 year old Mensa member  urlLink Ellen Muth . She doesn't really have any credits to her name....unlike supporting cast member  urlLink Mandy Pantinkin  (known best to audiences for his role as Geoffery Geiger in the great first season of Chicago Hope). The show also did the impossible for me. It actually made me like  urlLink Rebecca Gayheart . A woman who previously has given me sharp stabbing pains in the temples everytime she gets on screen. Here she's actually quite funny. The showrunner and creator is  urlLink Bryan Fuller .   So, what happens in the crucial first episode?  A ton of great funny moments and a heck of a lot of script development. George dies. She finds out she's a ghost, and in turn a grim reaper. Then there's fun and hi-jinks as she learns how to be a Reaper, while also making some contact with her family. There's a beautiful moment where she rearranges some magnet letters on the family fridge to contact her mother from the afterlife.....it's certainly not a sacchrine moment.   But is it any good?  It's certainly the most promising new show I've seen in a few years. It works as a bit of a mixture of  urlLink Ghost World  meets  urlLink Six Feet Under , but brings its own vibe to the mix. It's a hoot.

      Cultural leader Christina Aguilera has foretold the virtues of getting dirty. I've learnt much from this lady. Firstly, I look horrible in arse chaps. Secondly, I like the dirty. And thusly, I enjoyed the heck out of  urlLink The Shield . They're cops who aren't afraid to get a little bit dirty. And that, I respect. Unless of course you're a character  urlLink Denzel Washington  played to get an Academy Award which he didn't deserve.   So, What's The Deal?  We're in an area like South Central in LA. The criminals are nasty and violent, so the police have set up a special task force to deal with the crime. A task force thats been getting nastier and more violent than the criminals they persue. They remain unhampered in their efforts, with the exception of their Lieutenant, a man trying to make a name for himself in the political arena by wanting to take down the leader of the task force, Vic Mackey.   Who's In It?  Of the ensemble cast, only two of them are particularly recognisable. Respected TV guest star CCH Pounder, and the former Commish  urlLink Michael Chikilis . The series is created and produced by former Angel writer Shawn Ryan, with the pilot directed by former Homicide: Life On The Street star  urlLink Clark Johnson . But wait, is that former Homicide star  urlLink Reed Diamond  putting in a few guest appearances?   So, what happens in the crucial first episode?  Well, there's a trio of child molesters swapping and trading young girls. Always light television staples that are great for laughs. Throw in the Lieutenants plot to infiltrate the Strike force with a snitch...which is where Reed Diamond enters the fray.   But Is It Any Good? My word yes. This is very much to cop shows what The Sopranos is to gangster flicks. It's very similar to the flick Training Day in tone. Apparently channel 10 are going to be screening the series in the coming weeks. Give it a burl. It's ace.

      After the wholesomy goodness of Mister Sterling, the dirty nature of the very lame Skin, and the tragically even lamer Fearless, there's finally a pilot thats made its way onto my hard drive that has delivered the goods. Karen Sisco.  A few years ago, there were two things that rocked my cotton white socks. The movie Out of Sight, and the heavenly beauty that is Carla Gugino. This television series merges them both together in a cacophony of television goodness.   So, What's the deal?  Karen Sisco is a television series based on the character from the movie Out of Sight. The film starred Jennifer Lopez in the only good film she's ever made.  The focus is split in the series between her work as a US Marshall, her relationship with her father (formally a US Marshall), and her relationships with other men. All three are always entwined in some manner.    Who's In It?  Well, there's Carla Gugino, who is not only a babe, but has also starred in the first season of Spin City, the Pauly Shore modern day classic Son In-Law, and the well-directed, but ultimately crappy flick Snake Eyes. She's ultra-fab as a leading lady, and works a treat as Sisco. Her father is played by Robert Forester who I dug in Jackie Brown. And then there's the guest cast for the first episode featuring Jake Busey and Xander Berkely. Mostly, the casting is pretty top-notch.  Out of Sights writer Scott Frank is also on board as a consulting producer, with the show being produced by Danny DeVito's production company Jersey Television.   So, what happens in the crucial first episode?  The show is in an odd position in that the events of the film can be presumed to have taken place. So, the pilot is more about re-establishing the characters and the way they involve themselves in her life. The episode is also given a plot with Karen seeking out an escaped prisoner of whom she inadvertantly helps escape.  But is it any good? Very much so. It's a show that the first 4-5 episodes will either make or break, but its stylish and reasonably involving. The escaped prisoner storyline didn't do a huge amount for me, but everything else held together pretty darn well. It's off to a very strong start.

      Horror has a new name, and that name is Everybody Loves Raymond. By itself, it's not completely horrible. It's certainly much more watchable than a lot of other family-centred sitcoms on the air (primarily I'm thinking about the abysmal Reba, but there's certainly a lot of other examples). What irks me is how channel 10 have adopted Raymond as the jewel in its comedy crown. For a while, it was being aired no less than seven times a week with a mix of both new and old episodes in various timeslots.   Two words. One hyphen: Over-kill.  The show can actually be entertaining, there's the occasional inspired, funny moment. It just simply isn't that good. In no way does it have the watchability of a show like Seinfeld, or Frasier. Both shows tend to be repeated pretty frequently lately, and I'm still yet to get sick of either despite how often I've seen the episodes.  Everybody Loves Raymond does have two strengths. The first is Peter Boyle. Honestly, Boyle isn't great in this, but generally, Boyle always delivers the comedy and dramatic  chops in anything he appears in. Just take a look at his Emmy-Award winning performance in The X-Files episode Clyde Bruckmans Final Repose, or his gig as the monster in Young Frankenstein. The dude is gold.      The second strength of the show is Brad Garrett, who has more or less become the focus of the show as Raymonds brother Robert.    The guy plays his lethargic, wounded butterfly character like no other ever could. The guy simply screams for you to pay attention to him with just his standard frowning glance. Currently, however, Garrett is fighting with the producers of the show over a pay dispute. He hasn't turned up to work for two weeks running as a ploy to get paid at a similar scale to his fellow cast-members. This morning I found this article online:   As the squabbles over salary continue between Brad Garrett and CBS, Garrett has decided not to report to the set of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND for another week. Yesterday, RAYMOND producer Phil Rosenthal decided to give Garrett the finger by giving co-stars Patricia Heaton, Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts a cut of the producing pie for the show. Each actor will get half a percentage point ownership in the show, which means they will profit about $5 to 7 million dollars. Producers have already cut Garrett out of the season premiere already and will likely do so for the second episode.  Source: Hollywood Reporter    That's just madness. The show is in what they declare to be the final season. Just pay the guy some cash and put up with him on set for a couple of months. He's really the only reason the show has been occasionally watchable. He might be an arsehole, but he's certainly bringing a lot more of the funny than the succubus Patricia Heaton. The woman needs a cross and a stake ASAP.  I say, pay the dude, they'll have a better show for it in the long run.

      Apparently someone won on televisions new game show sensation THE BLOCK. Of course, I have no idea who that is, as "reality" television makes me all snoozy. That said, the one "reality" show I have gotten into, The Amazing Race, is back on telly, 10:30 wednesday nights. Watch it. Love it.   I suspect the very fact that reality television bores the pants off of me (and it quite literally does, which makes for some embarassing moments in mixed company) is beginning to completely diminish my television watching habits. It's almost as if the number of filmed dramatic series diminishes even more significantly each year. Television executives are concerned about losing audiences to cable television and other entertainment forms such as the Internet and video games. Why continue to alienate a a huge chunk of your audience by only scheduling Joe Millionaire clones?  Almost all the television programs I watch are scheduled after 10:30 nowdays. Anytime I try tuning in to watch a telly show before then, I find it gets taken out of the schedule within just a few weeks. Just take a look at Ed and The Gilmore Girls. I don't think either show managed to get more than seven or eight episodes aired before the plug was pulled on them for lower than desired ratings. It'd be fine if they relocated the series, but to just end shows with continuing storylines midway through is straight out rude to the loyal audience.   If it wasn't for those oh so naughty pirates out there on the Internet, I doubt I'd actually find anything on television to watch at all.   urlLink COMMENT

      In his book High Fidelity, Nick Hornby asked whether depression leads to pop music, or whether pop music causes depression. The same can be said for current affairs shows. Is the world really in a sorry state of affairs, or does it just seem that way because Today Tonight have informed us that it is?  Every time I tune into Today Tonight, and its channel Nine partner-in-crime A Current Affair, the sheer tabloid nature of the shows spirals me into such a fit of anger that I'm honestly concerned I may turn big, green, and start throwing tanks around. The stories shown never give two-sides to an arguement, and are instead designed to do nothing more than anger the viewer against whatever group or organization the show is attacking.   Last night (12/8/03) in Queensland, the local Today Tonight edition aired a story about a building the government were leasing, but not using, for a large rental fee each month. Naomi Robson, one of Satans minions, as well as being the host of the show, introduced the story, told the viewers how outrageous the issue is, featured a two-second video grab of some white guy behind a desk telling us its outrageous, continued to rattle off some "facts", and then showed another one-line grab of the guy behind the desk.      Whatever happened to legitimate journalism? I'm not saying the government are in the right with the leasing of the building, but during this entire "story", the only person giving us any facts was the host of the show. There was no video footage of anything really backing the story up. There was next-to-no attribution given, and worst of all, there was no opportunity given for the supposed offenders to comment. Even if a government spokesperson decided not to comment, the least the story should have done is told us that the government would not comment.  The thing that irritates me the most is that despite the declining intelligence of the "reporting", large segments of the population still regard each story as the complete truth.  Even those that know how bullshit the stories are continue to watch. And why? Because the only alternative is Neighbours.

       I'd fallen in love. Sure, I never realised it at the time, but as I looked at its glow, I knew we'd be together for the rest of our lives.   Or so I'd thought. Instead, The Wonder Years simply disappeared from my life. In the early 90's, Channel 10, in a stroke of programming genius, aired The Wonder Years every afternoon at, what I remember to be, 4:30pm. I watched the show daily watching Kevin Arnold growing up with me, and as the episodes passed, growing older than me. As the episodes progressed, the lessons Kevin learned became more adult than I was prepared for at that age. I may not have understood them properly at the time, but the messages still came through to an extent.                                                                                 This evening, I found myself watching the show on cable, where everything old is new again. Two things struck me while watching it. Firstly, the show is damn entertaining.  The writing, direction, and even the acting was all remarkably sincere. It may not have rung completely true, but its as close as TV of this nature is likely to get. Secondly, it's a shame that kids these days aren't getting the opportunity to watch this show. I realise the show is occasionally aired by Channel 7 on saturday mornings/afternoons, but its somehow not quite the same.  There aren't many dramatic shows made that kids can watch and actually relate to. Most dramatic scripted shows are either fantasy-based, or simply don't cover subjects that the viewers will likely experience in their own lives. Props to The Wonder Years for actually managing to do this.

      It hasn't really come as much of a suprise, but newspapers nationwide this morning have been reporting that Channel Nine have cancelled  urlLink Micallef Tonight . Quite a shame really. I haven't seen the show at all for a few weeks, but it was quite easily one of the better variety talk shows on TV. Micallef has a great offbeat comedic voice, and its a little sad to see that it's been silenced.   One has to question why Micallef was poached by Channel Nine to begin with. It was obvious watching the show that they were trying desperately to tone down the exact same comedic style that Micallef is known for and was hired to bring to the show. He was lumped with horrid guests, of whom were marketed to be the focus-point of the show. Instead of actually tailoring the show to Micallefs strengths (ie sketches and other written bits), they instead tried to foist even blander guests upon him. Nine's last failure in doing a late-night variety show was Rove. Ten dusted it off and actually gave the show some support and confidence, and the thing has taken off. One could almost be caught wondering if a similar thing could happen for a performer with comedic talent.  Ironically, the news of Micallefs cancellation comes at the same time as several shows being cut from the ABC. The most notable one being the childrens current affairs series Behind The News. The worlds biggest nob, our communications minister Richard Alston attacked the ABC for cancelling shows like BTN while lighter comedy series like The Glasshouse is still on the air. Alston is under the impression that commercial networks are catering product for the same audience that watch lighter-hearted fare on the ABC. The cancellation of former ABC-comedian Micallef from Channel 9 just proves how wrong that belief is.  At least it lasted longer than  urlLink The Mick Molloy Show .

      The film The American president had its President utter the line "This is a serious job for serious people". The films writer Aaron Sorkin seems to have always kept this in mind over the four seasons in which he'd written The West Wing. His characters were very much serious people, working in a serious job. Despie this, the characters were also human. Despite their approach to their work, they were given life through what was also a harmonic song of vibrancy. Each line of dialogue sparkled and shone as a beacon of life through an industry that tends to treat dialogue purely perfunctory.  The season premiere of the fifth season of the show aired in the US this week. It's the first episode to be aired that was written without the guidance of Sorkin.  Ever since I heard about the departure of Sorkin, I feared that the show would join the pantheon of other great television shows that would go on to die. And if this first episode is anything to go by, then my fears appear to have been confirmed.  It is a serious job, for serious people. But the people are also intelligent and smart as a whip, whatever the heck that means. This, however, has fallen by the wayside. These former smart characters are not only not saying much of intelligence, but they're also not even acting seriously about their job. Witness Josh, the Deputy Chief of Staff of The White House sitting in a room lounging with his assistant, and fellow senior staffer Toby. Both of them have important voices in the White House, yet neither are involved in the events surrounding them, but are instead voicing their concerns for the viewing audience.  The West Wing characters are akin to a husk of their former selves. Sapped of their intelligence and their life,  it's almost as if they are now without a soul. They're cast off to wander the TV desert of other lifeless serious characters on television. The storylines may continue to grow and develop, but that has never been what The West Wing was about.   Farewell The West Wing. Welcome to the world of mediocrity.

      Apart from being a big TV geek, I'm also a big movie geek. While there's some who believe it's best to immerse oneself into the film and not pay attention to ones surroundings, I'm quite the opposite. Where and how you watch a film has a huge impact on how you view a film. You don't need a state of the art cinema to really enjoy a film. Some of my favorite movie experiences have been in the most run down cinemas mankind has ever constructed.  Something that I always enjoy is a trip to the drive-in. Admittedly, anytime in the past I've gone to the drive-in I have never seen a whole lot of the movie. But when you consider the last film I saw at the drive-in was Rob Schneider in  urlLink The Animal , you'll realize that's no great loss.   Anyhow, I just found this article online from  urlLink The Age  and figured I'd share it with you all....enjoy!     Fifty years on, cinema in the sedan is enjoying a resurgence, writes Suzanne Carbone.   Drive-ins have come a long way since the days of crackly speakers hung on the car window. But some things never change: people are still trying to sneak in via the car boot.  Cars with sagging boots don't often get past the ticket box, but the audacity is part of the thrill, as is romance under the stars on a first date to remember - even if the film is a distant memory.  It is 50 years since construction began on Australia's first drive-in, the Burwood Skyline. From the boom times of 320 nationwide, only 25 remain, with four in Victoria at Coburg, Dandenong, Dromana and Shepparton.  But the industry has fought back since the graveyard era that started in 1984, when the video recorder and the sell-off of drive-in land looked like spelling its death.  Dandenong's Lunar Drive-in opened its third screen on Thursday last week to cater for the sprawling outer suburbs and their appetite for Choc-Tops and action films.  Lunar director and drive-in buff David Kilderry, his brother Matthew and friend Anthony Madigan set out last year on their Lunar mission, to recreate the glory days of the 47-year-old Dandenong Drive-in after an 18-year closure.  Last Saturday night, girls in hipster jeans mingled in the snack bar with young women in pyjamas and moccasins. Outside, vintage Fords parked alongside the panel vans and family sedans. Snuggled up in the back of their station wagon with a mattress, doona and pillows were Shanagh Lavery and Nick Burnham, who liked the comfort and privacy of their car. "You can relax," Ms Lavery said, "and bring a pizza."  Sally and Ron McBride brought Laura, 11, and Brittany, seven, to the early-bird session at 6.30pm to see Finding Nemo, and the double feature at 8.45pm, Legally Blonde 2 and Bruce Almighty. Mrs McBride said three movies for $41 was great value, but even better was the absence of annoying neighbours.  The drive-in craze began in the United States in June 1933 when Richard Hollingshead opened the world's first at Camden, New Jersey. It has been the focus of popular culture, immortalised in the films Grease and American Graffiti, and in the opening credits of the TV cartoon series The Flintstones.  Victoria had 60 drive-ins during the peak era in the 1960s and 1970s when EH Holdens and Chargers reigned.  Drive-in names conveyed the romance of the outdoors - the Maribyrnong Sunset, Moe Fairsky, Bairnsdale Moondale and Echuca River-Vu.  The 38-year-old Coburg Drive-in has kept the romance alive with a retro theme that lures the 1950s car enthusiasts with hairstyles to match. Many groovers prefer the old window speakers over FM stereo radio, which was first introduced at Dromana in the late 1980s.  Everyone has a drive-in story, such as the time a fire broke out behind the Coburg screen during The Towering Inferno and patrons thought the fire engines racing through the car park were a publicity stunt related to the film. Mr Kilderry was mesmerised by the very big screen while growing up, seeing the Coburg Drive-in from his home in Reservoir. He said the industry's enduring charm was nostalgia meets retro-chic. "The drive-in combines two icons of the 20th century, the motion picture and the automobile," Mr Kilderry said, adding that it offered the ultimate escape on wheels. "That is what the cinema has over in-home entertainment. The TV is just a piece of furniture."  Mr Kilderry said the drive-in's appeal was timeless: for the oldies it was nostalgic and for the youngsters it was novel. It offered value for money and freedom - patrons pay by the car load and dress as they like (yes, tracky dacks and pyjamas). It is a group experience that can be personalised and, unlike indoor cinemas, you can adjust the sound and the temperature. As the saying goes: "At the drive-in you can smoke, drink and slash your own seats."  But there's more. When R-rated sex films were hugely successful between 1971 and 1981, they drove away families but attracted a new clientele, with reports that a prostitute set up shop in the Wantirna Drive-in snack bar.  Videos, suburban multiplex cinemas and the DVD have failed to extinguish the lure of the drive-in. John Iozzi, the managing director of Village Cinemas Australia, which runs Coburg, said it continued to be popular for its "novelty meets nostalgia" experience. "For a lot of people, they are reliving their teen and early adult years," Mr Iozzi said.  It is hoped a retro-chic theme will lure buffs to the temporary Moonlight Drive-in at the Queen Victoria Market car park from next Friday to November 16, to be run by the organisers of the Moonlight Cinema at the Royal Botanic Gardens.  Others plan to reopen the Warragul Twilite Drive-in on weekends.

      What a fab day of television. This morning the Emmy Awards on Fox 8, then this afternoon The Bad News Bears got a screening on Channel 9. It's almost as though there's a TV junkie somewhere who'd sold his soul.    What made the Emmy Awards much more watchable this year than most was that Fox 8 broadcast the event live from the US. The benefit of this was that I didn't spend the day trying to avoid the media all day so as not to be spoiled. While it was disappointing that Aaron Sorkin missed out on an award for writing on The West Wing, it was fantastic to see the show score an award for Best Drama. The show had a lot of critics this year for lacking relevance in the current political climate. It was often claimed that the show should reflect a more Republican attitude (you know, despite the fact that the show is about a Democratic leadership....). What a lot of these same critics have missed is that its never really been a show about politics. It's always been about supporting the ideal of being intelligent, a quality that the show has offered in bucketloads over the last season. The win was a nice final hurrah for Sorkin.  Something that always suprises me is the way that Conan O'Brien manages to find himself on stage at the Emmy's (such as his hosting gig last year), yet the jewel in NBC's late night crown Jay Leno is never to be seen. It's believed that Conan is the heir apparent to The Tonight Show once Leno decides he wants out, but after watching the way Conan takes control of an audience at an event like the Emmy's, it's a constant marvel that NBC hasn't tried to show Leno the door.     Classiest moment of the evening was this hornbag moment:

      So I'm talking to this chick the other day and she starts telling me that she doesn't watch television. Immediately my respect for her sank and I decided on the spot, there and then, that I would not sleep with her. It was the best course of action. So, I ask her why, and she tells me that there is nothing good on. P'shaw. The only answers I would have accepted then was either a) "I don't have time for when I'm not at work, I'm patrolling the city in my superhero guise, protecting the innocent", or b) I would watch more, but there just isn't enough being broadcast in High Definition.  Because I know chicks, and they're all about the HD.  But she did have a point. There isn't a whole lot on television that's worthy. At least, not before 10:30pm. Off the top of my head, the only shows before 10:30 that actually get me tuning in from time to time is Frasier, the occasional Law & Order (just not SVU....I do have some standards), The Movie Show, and CNNNN. That equals up to almost two and a half hours per week of viewing.  Late night TV however, now we're cooking baby. There's treasures like 6 Feet Under, Trauma - Life In The ER, Dark Angel, Miracles, King Of the Hill, Studio 22, Futurama, the Lone Gunmen (not great, but passingly entertaining), The Agency, Hill Street Blues, It's Like Y'Know, and then of course there's Letterman almost nightly. Plus then on cable, there's the likes of Conan O'Brien, and Colin Quinn's Tough Crowd. Late night telly varies weekly and requires a vigilant audience, but there's treasure to be had me hearties. Yarrrrrr.                                                                              * * * * * * * * * * * *  Through the glory of Bittorrent, I'm just 2% shy of downloading a 1.7gig file. Whoever even knew that was possible?

      God bless the good people at HBO. With the exception of Sex & The City, they keep on pumping out great show after great show. I'd like to be able to enjoy S&TC, but it just isn't very good. Yet they gave great recurring guest stars like Ron Livingston and Even Handler. It conflicts me so.  But I digress.  I have no idea if it's been launched yet, but HBO are screening a brand spanking new drama called Carnivale. The premise is about a healing man (a la The Green Mile) played by Terminator 3's Nick Stahl, who finds his path crossing with a travelling group of circus folk in the 1930's. It's the closest that TV has ever gotten to a Vertigo comic book.   The thing that gets me, however, is that the premise seems ever so familiar....as though we've heard it before....  KRAMER: ...And you're the manager of the circus.  JERRY: A circus?  KRAMER: Come on, this is a great idea. Look at the characters. You've got all these freaks on the show. A woman with a moustache? I mean, who wouldn't tune in to see a women with a moustache? You've for the tallest man in the world; a guy who's just a head.  JERRY: I don't think so.  KRAMER: Look Jerry, the show isn't about the circus, it's about watching freaks.  JERRY: I don't think the network will go for it.  KRAMER: Why not?  JERRY: Look, I'm not pitching a show about freaks.  KRAMER: Oh come on Jerry, you're wrong. People, they want to watch freaks. This is a "can't miss."

      In my soulless eyes, there's nothing better than a well made dramatic television series. Witness my love for current shows like The West Wing, 24, the Law & Order shows (not that I see any of them as often as I probably should), etc. As a viewer you have to commit to them a little, but generally they can be far more rewarding than most movies these days.  The thing is, there's also a string of television shows that want to be the high quality shows, but simply will never quite cut the mustard. If the popular shows are the Fonzie's, these second stringer shows are the Chachi's. They're okay and might arouse the attention of Joannie Cunningham, but they'll never score highly with a Leathers Tuscardeo.  Last night saw the emmergence of another Chachi, the new action-drama The Agency.     So, what's the deal with it?  The 90's showed that smart action drama's can be done weekly on a television budget. The best example of this is The X-Files which featured a ton of impressive special effects and stunt work on a smallish budget. Basically, a lot of corners were cut, but they covered it up to look as classy as possible. The trick is to have a director and writers good enough to hide the cut corners.  The Agency has so many corners, it's boxed itself in. After having watched the first episode, I'm still at a slight loss as to what the exact premise of the series is, other than it's about CIA Agents trying to stop stuff every week. Which isn't really a bad place to start. The problem lies with the fact that all of the characters are replica's of no-specific characters you've seen in tons of shows like this before, the plot aims far higher than it should be, and the dialogue is pretty poorly handled. But it is a first episode, and the cast and concept is good enough to maybe eventually get cooking.   Who's In It?  Well, there's that dude who played Billy in Ally McBeal, Gil Bellows. He makes a fine lead in a drama series like this, and with the knowledge that The Agency didn't make it past a second season, I wouldn't mind horribly watching him star in something of a little higher quality. Other notable characters are played by ER's Gloria Reuben, Ronny Cox (who you've seen in a whole slew of movies including his classic role as Richard "Dick" Jones in Robocop), and the second movie April O'Neil: Paige Turco (also seen in the short-lived American Gothic).  Former Hardy Boy Shaun Cassidy is one of the executive producers of the series,  with another being German director Wolfgang Peterson (U-Boat).   So, what happens in the crucial first episode?  They try to stop a visiting Fidel Castro from being assasinated during a trip to the United Nations building in New York. Watch for horrible production values as Fidel Castro arrives to an enthusiastic reception of ten people waving flags. Also watch for high-up CIA officials who laugh when they learn that past attempts to assasinate Castro involved giving him explosive cigars (as most Modern History high school students across the globe are fully aware).   But is it any good?  I'd watch it again, but only in the same way that I might find myself watching an episode of Get Smart if I stumble upon it. It would be interesting to see if it improves at all, especially with the minor cast shake-up mid season.  In summary, the CIA are only looking out for what's best for everyone. Now let us hold hands and sing folk songs....but only with tight camera shots so that the audience doesn't realise that the set we're on is not by a campfire, but instead on an old Dr Quinn Medicine Woman set.

      According to  urlLink Reuters , the US ABC are launching an awards show for Reality TV shows:   ABC to Air Awards Show for Reality Television Thu September 4, 2003 06:36 PM ET LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Would you believe it? Reality television shows will get their own prime-time awards program so that "Joe Millionaire" can rub shoulders with Oscar.  ABC said on Thursday it will, in conjunction with Don Mischer Productions, create a prime-time awards show honoring broadcast and cable reality programs.  Nominees for the two-hour awards show, set to air this fall, will be chosen by a panel of about 200 people, the network said, and winners will be chosen by the public via Internet balloting.  Mischer is a veteran of TV awards shows, in particular the prime-time Emmys, and the new, as-yet untitled program will feature both series honors like "Best Series" as well as reality-appropriate categories like "Best Twist."  Programs airing in the 2002-2003 season, including this summer, are eligible for nomination, the network said.  In the period from Sept. 2002 to May 2003, according to Nielsen Media Research, five of the top 10 shows on TV were reality programs, including the dating series "Joe Millionaire" and two editions of competition show "Survivor."  ABC is a unit of the Walt Disney Co.   As much as the idea makes me want to cry my heart out into my Webster pillow-case, there is something I do want to see. If they're to remain true to the concept of reality television, the entire awards show should be filmed entirely on shaky hand-held cameras. In fact, they should go as far as to not even show the awards ceremony, but shoot it entirely from backstage.  But that would be going against the entire being of reality television. It'd be being creative. Heaven forbid.

      The Hollywood Reporter today announced that Universal have signed a deal with Joss Whedon to write and direct a big-screen version of his failed television series FIREFLY. Fuckin A!     Firefly hasn't begun airing in Australia yet, but after a short ten week run in the US on the FOX Network, they canned the show. I believe channel 7 have the local rights for it. The show is your standard group of men and women facing adventure and excitement while travelling through outer-space. While there was the danger with this show that we've seen it all before, the writing in the show brought forth a very charming vibe of fun and warmth to the genre that hasn't really been developed in a show of this ilk.   There's a DVD set of all the episodes being released in a few months time. It is so successful, Amazons pre-orders have already sold out.   It's refreshing to see a TV-concept hit the big-screen that isn't a lame remake of a forgotten show from the 70's. There's so much creativity coming out of television lately (even with the reality-TV crap thats filling up so much of the airwaves), it's great to see some of it actually getting some public recognition.  Very shiny.

      Fuck the corporations! I've been thinking about the ways that the music industry, and now the movie industry are attacking people who pirate their copyrighted goods. I'm going to start by throwing out a few thoughts that you've undoubtedly considered yourself, or in the very least have read many times before.  It's well known that most artists don't make much cash directly out of their album sales. So, for the average "pirate", its basically a battle between them and a faceless corporation who are just out to make more money. The corporations don't retaliate by working towards getting the consumer to be enthusiastic about the product again, instead they're trying to imprison or at least put some fear into them.  That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Companies peddling other wares would kill to get the consumers to sample their products, what makes music any different? Logic dictates to me that if a consumer would rather steal your product rather than buy it from you, you should try to work out what makes it appealing to them. Adding more content makes it much more expensive to produce, so that's not necessarily an option. But surely there's a way to do it?  Yes, I've thrown out an oft-repeated question out there. But where am I leading with this?  Apparently Universal Music in the US have lowered their RRP on CD's. Logic is finally rearing its head. If consumers want to steal from you, why not lower the price down enough that its a no-brainer to spend just a couple of bucks more than the time and effort involved in pirating a disc. I'm sure the average person would rather spend a few bucks on a disc, rather than download 10-14 mp3's, convert them to wav's, then burn them to disc. You're wasting bandwidth, time, and a blank disc. I don't know if my high school economics is about to let me down here, but the average rule of supply and demand means that if you can get a lot more product out there, it can become cheaper. If its cheaper, chances are more people will buy it. You just have to market it correctly.  My purchase a few days ago of The Goodies on DVD have me thinking about TV shows on DVD. Why the heck do they tend to cost so much? Recently Fox did a pretty smart thing and released some X-Files, Futurama, Buffy, and Angel episodes on DVD for $15 a disc. Thats genius, but even so, lower the cost a little and mass-market the hell out of them. Charge, say, $8 for a disc with 2-3 episodes on it. Eight bucks for a few hours entertainment is perfectly fair. Its practically the same price as a video rental. Sell the discs everywhere from petrol stations to supermarkets, to department stores. People are sure to pick up at least one or two discs each week, if not more if they get really hooked on the show. There's so much product coming out of

      With the announcement that the ABC was going to bring back Dr Who weeknights (starting mid September), nerds across the nation (after a quick daliance with some Kleenex) began to wonder if this might pave the way for another screening of the other ABC staple, The Goodies.  Thanks to the marvelous glory of DVD, this question isn't such an issue anymore. 8 "Delicious" episodes are now available for you to own on two shiny discs.     When I popped in the discs the other day, I was astounded by two notable things. The first was the picture quality. Never have I seen the show look as amazingly crisp as it does in this collection. At one point in the rather poor commentary for "The Goodies and The Beanstalk", its remarked that the picture quality is even better than it was originally in real life.   The second thing that astounded me was the level of special effects that were used in the show. Not only was there a heck of a lot of effects, but its obvious that a great deal of effort had been spent in their creation. The episode "Kitty Kong" is filled to the brim with effects shots. Sure, the effects are pretty poor looking compared to todays SFX, they won't exactly have you marvel or quake with fear as The Goodies face off against the awesome might of the giant kitten, but considering it was the very early 70's, its damn impressive.  K-Mart this week were offering the disc set at $39, while most stores were charging at least $47. It makes it a pricey disc set to buy on a whim. I'd hesitated at first, but the novelty value of it was too great and I caved. Thankfully so, as its been one of the most enjoyable DVD's I've spun in the last few years. A lot of the jokes may be a little dated and tired now, but the comedy is just so genuine, and there's enough absurdist brilliance in each episode to make it more than worth your while. If you have even a mild fondness for the show, it's well worth every cent (but shop around).

      I felt completely shagged. It'd been a hard days work. My evening was spent going out to dinner and seeing a movie. Ordinarily, dinner + movie = good evening out, but I was so tuckered out that I simply wanted to crash. So, you can understand the predicament I was in when trying to fall asleep. The TV was on. Sleep timer set. Me in bed. The FOXTEL remote on the floor, three metres away.  And on television....  "My Mother The Car".  Now, I'd never seen this show before. I was vaguely aware of the concept, but considered it to be such an oddity from yesteryear that I never expected to have to endure the pain that is "My Mother The Car".     Let us just think about the title of the show. "My Mother The Car". What television executive in their right mind would even consider green-lighting a show like that? It's madness. A show with a talking horse. Sure. Why not? It's a little goofy, but it's a fun concept. A talking car? Sure. Why not? Knight Rider was a pretty cool show, and that car spoke. And what a car it was. Heck, K.I.T.T. was as close to a ladies man as a car can get.  But a talking car that is in fact the reincarnated mother of the star of the show? The Freudian aspects to the concept are more than enough to wierd me out.  Dave Crabtree (played by Jerry van Dyke) is not only living his life in a separate bed to his wife, but also one day discovers that his mother has been reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile. And what more, he keeps it a secret from his wife. If that isn't an unhealthy mother-son relationship, I'm not sure what is. Makes me quite concerned about Dave's relationship with his father, and any subsequent actions he may take if his father takes the old car out for a ride.  Thankfully the show was cancelled pretty quickly. What troubles me is that the show is still being aired on television. Surely after it's cancellation, someone should have had the good sense to place the film it was shot on into a rocket and fire it at the sun. Why didn't the UN step in and organize for that to happen? Television should be an enriching experience. Or at least one that allows you to enjoy the snappy banter of five retired women living fulfilling sex-lives in Florida. This whole experience has left me feeling rather dirty.

      Hey I love the TV in a way that's hard to explain. Sometimes I feel more intimate with it than I ever could a woman. Even bea Arthur.  But Bea Arthur on television, now then we'd have something.  But occasionally I have to step away from the picture tube.  But don't fret. Usually it's just to go to the movies. Now, lately there's been a movie event that has just rocked my small 2D world. Kill Bill. Honest to god, I can't think of a more perfect film that wasn't Pulp Fiction.  Okay, maybe Flashdance, but that's another issue altogether.  Every few years a movie comes along and I find myself completely obsessed. It's pretty rare I'll see the same movie at the cinemas more than once, but I've seen Kill Bill twice now, with at least a third trip to the picture house planned. The last time I was this obsessed with a film was my inexplicable love for the hardcore Maximus in GLADIATOR.   If you find yourself alone, riding through green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium, and are already dead.    I saw that flick so many times that I even found myself high on cocaine beating a woman with a mace.  Or was that Ralph Cifaretto in The Soprano's? I forget, and ultimately, is that really important?

      First up, sorry I haven't updated the blog for a while, but I've been busy contesting leadership of the Labor party.  As my stalkers would well know, I'm quite a fan of the comedic stylings of Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Tony Martin, in particular, is a darned talented dude, which is evident through his cop comedy film "Bad Eggs" which was just released on DVD. While a fine film itself, the DVD is a joy to behold. Keeping in mind that the film made no money at all at the box office, it's fantastic to see so much work went into the production of ther DVD. Along with two commentries, the disc also boasts a documentary, production stills, a booklet, and lots of other crap. It's most certainly worth a purchase.  The true gem on the disc however is in one of the hidden "easter egg" menu's. It's a clip from the late Micallef Tonight television series. The clip is a sketch of a television executives meeting where they're hammering out the concept for a new show they want to produce. The room is silent until one guy runs through his rough concept for a series.  Executive 1: "What about a show, right....and I don't know what would be in it......but hosted by Eddie Maguire...."  The room remains silent for a moment.  Executive 2: "Yep, alright. Let's make a pilot."  As Homer Simpson would be likely to say "It's funny because it's true".

      On TV for the last few weeks I keep seeing advertisements for this new condom company called Duo. The ads always feature an incredibly good looking young man or woman noticing another incredibly good looking man or woman somewhere in the outside world. An exchange will occur between the two of them. A subtle glance.  Now, from an outside viewpoint, each of them obviously want to shag one another. I mean, come on, they're both incredibly good looking. The slogan comes up on the screen and says something along the lines of "when two people have the same idea".  But see, for me the advertisements just don't ring true. Now granted, I'm not ridiculously good looking. Perhaps that's why it just doesn't quite work for me. But in my limited world experience, there seems to be something lacking from the advertisements. A certain sense of realisim is lacking.  Everytime I see the ads, I have to ask: where is the begging?  No self respecting woman is going to just see a guy and want to drop her panties for him. No sir. It just isn't going to happen. I've read the science journals. She needs a little romance first. or at least a big jug of goon.

      I don't get paid for writing on my website here. Honestly, why would someone pay me for this? (But then, channel 9 pay people to write Stingers, so it's proved we're living in quite the mixed up world where anythings possible). So, in my state of non-pay, I am absolutely sickened by the lax attitudes taken by professionally paid television reviewers and commentators.  Weekly I read publications like the Australian's 'Media' section, yet not once have I ever heard a criticism on the last bastion of news integrity. That's right, I'm talking about  urlLink The Naked News .    The Naked News has been around for a few years now. They're seasoned veterans. Surely they've had time to wet their toes in the world of broadcast news. But honestly, I feel their coverage of the war in Iraq has been pretty piss-weak. It seems to me that the women are just standing around taking off their clothes.  Where's the news?  They're lucky that they've got a monopoly of naked newscasting in the US, because should any competition develop, they'll be done for. Imagine how quickly the viewership'd drop if the mainstream media started getting into it? Once Barbara Walters gets in on the act, they're finished.

      It's an endless circle of life this blogging business. I mention something, so  urlLink someone  picks up on it and posts it in his blog, and now here I am mentioning that he mentioned my post in his post.  Madness I tells ya.  But, onto more pressing matters. But beware, this is about to get insanely serious and dry. I try to stay clear of anything that reeks of intelligence like this, but I thought it was a pretty cool article about the development of the pay-tv infastructure being developed.   Foxtel's Digital Vision Coming at an estimated cost of over AUD$600 million, the digitalisation of Foxtel is well underway. NDS Group has been engaged to provide conditional access and an electronic programme guide, Pace will take a lead role in supplying set-top boxes and middleware will come from Open TV. Pace and NDS also have involvement in the development of PVR technology for the pay-TV provider, while on the network side, Telstra is installing cable head-ends and a new digital play-out centre is under construction in the Sydney suburb of North Ryde. Speaking at this year's Australian Broadcasting Authority Conference in Canberra, Patrick Delany, Director of Digital for Foxtel, said the launch of Foxtel Digital in early 2004 is not about technology, it's about entertainment. "It's about building a platform upon which entertainment and people making choices can thrive," he says. "You will not need a new TV set for Foxtel Digital. We will simply turn up and swap your box if you're an existing subscriber, install your return path and you're off.  "There will be better quality pictures and sound. It will be 'DVD-lite' in the crispness of the picture and Dolby sound. We will have over 100 channels at launch which is a larger number of channels compared to our current 47." The tool to navigate through this expanded universe of channels is the NDS-developed electronic programme guide which will be based in that used by Foxtel sister network, BskyB of the UK. According to Delany, "This guide will allow subscribers to really have a look and see what is on any television channel on Foxtel for up to eight days in advance. "You'll be able to categorise by channel, you'll be able to categorise by programme start time and then sift through movies and different genres. So, it's an excellent navigational tool and one that is absolutely essential when you have so many channels."   Also essential to the Foxtel Digital offering will be the 'Box Office', a bouquet of movie channels that will offer first-run, time delayed and near video on demand (NVOD) programming, including pay per view. "The Box Office will be very important to Foxtel," says Delany, "especially in the context of the DVD revolution that is going on. There's a tendency to think that one technology or one product has to always over-ride another. I think that many products can live within their own zone and be good for the area that they specialise in. We think Foxtel Box Office will fit a very wanting part of the market where you'll be able to choose the movie that you want to watch without having to drive to the video store for a similar price and with a similar quality that DVD has. I don't think for a second that it's going to mean the end of DVDs or the end of videos, but we hope that we will take a little bit of the market."   Added to this offering will be a variety of interactive capabilities which, Delany says, will concentrate mainly on the context of the pictures. He maintains the interactivity will be all about entertainment, not transactions. The interactive offering will, again, be similar to that currently running on the UK's BskyB. These include games, messaging, multi-view sport with access to match data and highlights, as well as a mini EPG of news channels and near news on demand. As is the case with the Foxtel Box Office, this will be achieved by aggregating several channels of vision into the one application. Once the digital roll-out is completed, Foxtel hopes to crown its offering with the introduction of hard disk-based Personal Video Recorders (or PVRs).   The Foxtel PVR will be very similar to the NDS XTV. The XTV allows authorized viewers to: access both live and stored content, watch one program while recording another; record two programs at once; fast forward, rewind, pause for live and recorded content; order a program directly from the operator's EPG; automatically schedule updates to avoid missing favourite programs; control which content to record or pause; record a single program or multiple episodes of a series. "We think that PVRs are a little bit like Holden's Monaro," says Delany. "It's an aspirational tool that we'll be introducing after launch and it really does give the ultimate in choice and control for our subscribers. It allows easy storage of your favourite shows. They'll be no more of this joke about the eight year old being able to set the timer on the video better than an adult." The final element of Foxtel's digital conversion, under ACCC conditions, is allowing newcomers and established broadcasters access to the platform (at a price). "We've offered the [terrestrial] broadcasters the opportunity to participate in terms of retransmission," says Delany. "The outcome that we think will be desirable from that is that it will allow consumers and subscribers to access both over-the-air and subscription channels through our EPG with ease. "Our subscribers will have more choices and we think that adds up to a better value equation. It means there'll be new ways in which they can engage with channels and we think it puts them closer to ultimate control over what they want to watch, when they want to watch it."

      I'd seen her before, but never paid as much attention to her as I should have. She beguilded me, but ultimately, there was just no way I was interested in committing to her at that stage in our lives. We were going different directions. Besides, once I got up close to her, much of the sparkle just vanished. Or perhaps it was never there. The initial affair was very brief and never went the distance.  Yet she's been on my mind. Inescapable. No matter how much I wanted to shut her out, she remained a beacon of possibility in the fog of choice. And then I decided it was time to once more seek her out.  Reaquainting myself with this heavenly beauty is one of the better things I've done in my life recently, and I strongly suggest, should you have the means, to do likewise. She's no Felicity, that's for sure. She's her own woman. She's ALIAS.   Oh lordy how I'm enjoying this show. If features everything I could ever want from a series that doesn't feature David Hasselhoff. ALIAS has hot chicks, well-choreographed fight scenes, and a bitching  complex spy-arc. I'm just five episodes into the series and I'm more than willing to commit for the long haul.   I'm just concerned how my other love affair  urlLink KAREN SISCO  will take the news. She's no longer the only one in my life. But alas, I'm a fickle man with needs.

      I'm going to be honest here, I've never read a Warren Ellis comic book. Or at least, I don't think I have. So, why am I on his mailing list? Well, the dude occasionally writes out some pretty spot-on commentaries about television shows he's been pissed off by.   For those of you unfamiliar, Warren Ellis is a comic book writer probably best known for his work on Transmetropolitan, and Planetary. He's written a ton of graphic novels, comics, videogames, and screenplays. Currently, Keanu reeves is set to play the title role in "Constantine"a big screen version of Ellis' "Hellblazer" books. What I'm saying is that Ellis isn't a hack. And if he is a hack, he's a very good one.  In my inbox yesterday was one of his email mailouts stating that any webmasters wanting to ask a few questions of the man could do so as long as they replied within twelve hours. Realising I had a mere twenty minutes before the deadline, I quickly scribbled down the four questions allowed and within hours, this mini-interview was complete.   And so, presenting hepcat.tk's first celebrity interview, albeit a short one.....  WARREN ELLIS [29/12/03] 1) Hollywood comes knocking on your door. They offer you the opportunity to take over the writing duties on any established TV series you choose, with complete artistic control. Which show do you choose, and what would you do to it?   God, I'm finding it hard to think of established TV shows currently running that I could do a single thing with... though, you know, it could be entertaining to take on something like ANDROMEDA, that is creatively just six feet under and rotting.  This occurs to me because the other day someone sent me a clipping from a Kevin Sorbo interview where he says something like, "it's sci-fi, you can't do it like it's THE WEST WING."  Which makes me think, of course you bloody can...   2) What would you consider to be the most exciting thing on television currently?   Absolutely nothing.  US/UK TV is an almost-unprecedented deadzone right now.   3) What's been the biggest disappointment to you as a viewer on TV this year?    Probably the new, Sorkin-less WEST WING.  It's like someone reached up inside of an animal and pulled its guts out.   4) As a professionally paid writer, you may be able to answer this question: They say that if you put a thousand monkeys in a room with a thousand typewriters, they'll write a great novel. Would each monkey then need it's own publicist on the book tour?   At least eight hundred of them would ask you what a publicist is.    It should be noted that this final answer is actually incorrect, the correct answer is in fact to answer the question with a question: "There's a difference between a publicist and a monkey?".

      I love my TV. Quite frankly, my love for it is unhealthy. I know this to be true. But, gosh darn it, I'm willing to suffer for my love.  There is something I respect more than television. I can hear the gasps from the audience. Yes, it's true. Something I really get into is mankind accomplishing stuff. Nothing fills me more with awe and wonder than when people set out to achieve something that will push mankind to the next level.   There's talk at the moment of Dubbya Bush investing money into NASA's resources to really get behind getting man back on the moon, and in turn, onto Mars. And to this I give a very enthusiastic "Woo hoo". Space exploration is one of those areas of accomplishment that's just been on the backburner for far too long.  100 years ago on this day, mankind made a leap forward. The Wright Brothers took the first flight into the sky. Another dream became an accomplishment as we took a further step into the unknown.

      I've never really spent much time on the farm or in a rural community. I'm a man of the suburbs. An urban warrior with a mullet and Triple M cranked loud. Whenever I do enter a foreign habitat, I generally adapt pretty well. After all, I've seen lots of movies. I know how the world works.  But then, I haven't lived in my own self-absorbed cocoon of wealth.  Enter 'The Simple Life' starring Paris Hilton and Lionel Ritchie's daughter. Obviously neither of them have seen many rural movies, because neither of them have a clue. It could be said in Hiltons case, however, that she's just too busy starring in them.  So, what's the deal with the show? They take the two rich girls away from their extravagant pads, and fly them out to a farm community to live with a 'typical' rural family to work on the farm. Along with the work, they're also expected to abide by the rules of the house, which includes no cussin, a midnight curfew, and small chores.     The novelty wears thin pretty quickly. Like most reality shows, it's stretched out for as long as possible. Along with the quality material is abouther fifteen minutes of padding. It's worthwhile taking a peek at, but it hardly makes for riveting television.  Somehow I suspect that there'll be a few disappointed people who go to the Fox "Simple Life"  urlLink website  and download the 'Paris & Nicole video'.  TECHNICAL ASPECTS: Shot in tru-surround Skank-O-Vision.

      It's a legitimate change to my website. Not that anyone will ever notice, because quite frankly, other than drug addicts and social reformists, who even reads this darn thing?  If you look over to the left hand side of the screen there, you'll notice a logo mentioning the TV Freakchat. Well, this is my new and adopted community. For those of you who are unaware of it, here's the deal: Almost two years ago, the ABC launched the TV Freak website. As a part of the larger ABC website, www.tvfreak.com.au was run by JJJ regular guest Scott Goodings for TV obsessed kids to post the day away. While highly addictive with a large volume of daily traffic, the ABC decided a few weeks ago to turf the regulars out on their collective ears and shut down the website.  And so, I set up a new home for them here. I feel just like Pippa Fletcher.  My old chat board is now gone. Well, technically it's still there, but will soon be lost for the ages. It shall be washed away in a sea of cyberspace. Instead, I've replaced it with my stolen community.  So, welcome to hepcat.tk TV Freakchatters, hopefully you'll find me to be a benevolent ruler.

      The bastard step-child that Shelley Long never wanted is finally drawing towards the end. Frasier Crane, after eleven years is leaving the building. A couple of days ago, NBC announced that this season would in fact be the final year for Frasier. While it will not receive the same level of attention as the Friends finale, I'm confident that Frasier will go out with class, and with jokes that are actually funny.  Frasier has always been an oddball sitcom on commercial television in the US. While it's never afraid to take the show in low-brow directions, the show has very rarely pandered to the lowest common denominator. The show isn't necessarily the smartest on TV, but it certainly doesn't stop the characters from thinking they may be. Frasier has spent 11 years on TV creating loved characters out of pompous and arrogant upper-class snobs. By celebrating their bombasity, as well as bringing them down a few pegs each time, it's created characters that one actually feels could be real. Unlike the paper thin characters that seem to inhabit almost every other sitcom.  It was during the middle of CHEERS' run that Frasier Crane first entered our lives. Originally entering the show as the fiance and love interest of Shelley Long's Diane Chambers character, Frasier was quickly embraced by the shows writers with his role expanding from just a short stint on the show to becomming a regular. With this new character in the show, the balance of the core of the show (the relationship between bar owner Sam Malone and Diane Chambers) was shifted quite considerably. Rumour has it that it was the impact that Frasier had on Cheers that caused Shelley Long to leave the series halfway through its run.  While the show was never quite as funny in its later seasons, the show still continued with high ratings  So Cheers begat Frasier, but what now for the Cheers/Frasier universe? There's talk of a spin-off series involving Frasiers brother Niles, which seems like a logical and potentially interesting place to take a new series. Certainly a character that will work better than with the proposed Friends spin-off 'Joey'.  It'll be a shame to see Frasier off the air, but all good things come to an end.   And yet the end of Will & Grace just can't come soon enough.

      I've occasionally heard that all you need in life is eating, drinking, and fucking. I say this isn't true. Otherwise, where would the life necessity KC & The Sunshine Band fit into things? And then there's Press Gang.  Oh Press Gang, how I love thee. I love thee more than life itself. Even more than Rasberry Cola. And I love Rasberry Cola.  Press Gang chronicled the tales of the staff of the Junior Gazette, a group of High School students offered the chance to write, design, edit, and print a weekly junior edition of the local "Gazette" newspaper. While never a soap opera in the way that a show like this could have been, writer Steven Moffatt created a childrens show that committed the cardinal sin of childrens TV. It's entertaining. The scripts were smart and funny, with a production style that perfectly complimented the concept of the show.  The show was a big part of my early teens, and I've always had a fond spot for the series. So imagine my delight when I was told about this gem coming to UK stores later this month:     The DVD set is a little light in the extras department (ie there are none), but its fantastic that we're finally going to see the show cleaned up a little and put on disc.

      Back in the day, Mike Myers was a cast member on the US sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. These were the days of Dieter, the german game show host.  Plans were afoot for Myers character of Dieter to be spun off into his own film, but instead Myers wasn't happy with the script and instead wrote the truly shyte Austin Powers 3, and is now the Cat In The Hat. He's soon to be part of the FOX television special "When funny comedians go bad".  The screenplay to Dieter can be located right  urlLink HERE .     Props go out to my buddy yesterday who, when facing some very close opposition from myself and another in a tense game of mini-golf, made a phenomonally brilliant tactical move and mooned us on the 15th hole. The move paid off as we completely lost our nerve from there on in. Kudos sir, my hat is off to you.  For the last few years I've had myself a wee bit of a DVD obsession. While I buy a lot of newer films on DVD, the films that actually excite me are the older films that I've enjoyed, but have deteriorated over time. There's nothing worse than watching a film you love on an old VHS tape. DVD is ever so pretty. The same can be said for the release of TV shows on DVD. For example, the Cheers series has never looked so good.   What I don't understand is some of the choices that distribution companies make with their DVD releases. Especially with box sets. Recently, with the SWAT movie released in cinemas, they issued out a box set of the SWAT TV series from the 70's. I can understand releasing a disc with some random episodes on it for those with a sense of curiosity, but I can't imagine they'd sell that many units of this mostly forgotten TV series. The same goes for:

      'tis the season for new telly.  Fa la la la la....la la....la la!  If I weren't a eunich, that last la could've been bothersome.  Usually I'm annoyed by a reviewer who chooses not to even sit through whatever it is that they're watching. Surely if you're going to give your opinion on something, you should at least have engaged in that of which you are reviewing. And so, I was hesitant to review the new lesbian drama The L Word from Showtime.  And that's when I remembered I don't actually have anyone who reads this blog. Hence, I care not for the lack of any percieved integrity.  The L Word isn't necessary 'love". The opening credits push forth this notion with a plethora of different L words. Lust, love, leperacy, lamentation, lamington, lupus, lesbian. It's this last L word that the show seems to be preoccupied by. It's a lesbian drama.     The term  lesbian drama  is offensive. There's more to a person or an artwork than just their sexuality. The problem is that The L Word falls into the same trap as the majority of supposedly progressive TV shows and movies that attempt to depict characters with queer and lesbian sexualities: there's just nothing else to it. It's a drama series where two-dimensional women have relationships with women, discuss their relationships with women, and have intercourse with women.   Any show that has me bored watching lesbians is criminal. But that's what I was, completely and thoroughly bored. It was just scene after scene of women talking about either wanting to be with the other, or why they don't want to be with them. There was just no real point to it all. If the show featured some crackling dialogue, or at least even some wit, the show may have developed some charm, but instead its just a big bland mess.  One of the infuriating aspects this show has (and the majority of TV shows are guilty of this same problem) is that all of the characters seem to have extrodinarily unique and interesting professions. Art buyer, journalist, chef for a swanky resturant, etc. Don't people just work mundane jobs in offices anymore?  There are a few good points about the show however. All is not completely lost. The trick is to turn the volume off.   The casting is great. Mia Kershner and Jennifer Beals lead a cast of what seems like a competent actresses, with supporting actresses like Pam Grier. It's a cool and good looking cast. And the cinematography is good looking as well. It's one of the nicest looking drama series I've seen in years. It's stunning to watch at times.  It's obvious that The L Word will build a loyal audience of viewers. I'm sure there'll be a vocal support from the 'lesbian community', as well as critical support for the series. It's just a shame that the show has such little depth to it. I recognise the irony in saying this about a lesbian drama, but what the show needs is some meat.

      Sometimes people find a character on a TV show or movie and sense something that reminds them of themselves. They may  identify with the rogueish nature of Han Solo, the charm of Ferris Beuller, or the desire for a middle aged man to dress up as an old lady like Mrs Doubtfire. More often then not, it's vanity talking. They may feel a kinship to the character, but it's more a desire to be like the character.  Sometimes however, one discovers a character they do identify with, and it terrifies them.  The more I watch the show, the more I'm convinced that I'm turning into him.  I'm becomming crotchety.  I'm becomming an annoying pain in the arse.  I'm finding a tendency to get angry and pissed off for no legitimate reason.  I'm Larry David.

      Several years ago on the now thankfully cancelled Ally McBeal, the concept of theme songs was raised. Recently a song has jumped out at me that I feel defines me as a person. And so, when the eventual biopic of my mundane existence finally hits the cinema screens (with a rapid trip straight to video), I certainly hope to hear this over the opening credits.   The Outdoor Type (by The Lemonheads)    Always had a roof above me Always paid the rent but I've never set foot inside a tent Can't build a fire to save my life I lied about being the outdoor type  i've never slept out underneath the stars, the closest that i came to that was one time my car broke down for an hour in the suburbs at night i lied about being the outdoor type.  Too scared to let you know you knew what you were looking for I lied until I fit the bill god bless the great indoors I lied about being the outdoor type I've never owned a sleeping bag let alone a mountain bike  i can't go away with you on a rock climbing weekend what if somethings on tv and its never shown again its just as well i'm not invited i'm afraid of heights i lied about being the outdoor type  Never learned to swim can't grow a beard or even fight I lied about being the outdoor type

      I always thought we lived in a sensible society. Apparently this is not so.  Over the last month, we've seen how the Americans have over-reacted to the lame Janet Jackson breast flash at the Super Bowl. They've attacked her for revealing her breast, as heaven knows how many impressionable children may have seen it. Since then, anything that has the slightest scent of sexuality, profanity, or even a glimpse of nudity has been re-edited and repackaged to appease the morality of the country's fine citizens. Don't worry though, you can still watch people get stabbed, killed, and blown up.   In Australia, we do things a little differently. I like to think that we're less reactionary and take things more in our stride. If there's a bit of nudity at a football game (be it a streaker, or whomever), it'll be met with some cheering, and if it's a female, any television cameras will stick with it for as long as possible. And why? Because it's not a big deal. The novelty value is high, and we're generally laid back, sensible folk.  As sensible people, when it comes to the media, we've established a code to ensure that adults are free to see whatever they'd so choose. And so we have a film classification system designed to guide consenting adults through content that may or may not be appealing to them. This same classification system is also designed to prevent minors from seeing films that aren't suitable for them. And I'm cool with this. I generally feel that the Office of Film and Literature Classification do a good job in this regard. What I do have an issue with them is this: They are an organization that are repeatedly influenced by very small interest groups from the moral right. Films that have been banned recently after the OFLC recieved no more than three complaints.  And so, I present you with this article from  urlLink UrbanCinefile :     ANOTHER FILM BAN LOOMS AS MINORITY EXERTS POWER Gaspar Noes R rated Irresistable, starring Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel, may be banned next week (March 29, 2004) by the Classification Review Board after complaints from both the Australian Family Association and Rev Fred Nile, who has written to the Federal Attorney General. What on earth were these people doing watching such a film? Didnt they see the R rating, asks Andrew L. Urban.  The whole point of a film classification system is to advise consumers, and thus avoid the pathetically paternalistic social regimentation censorship represents. If the Review board submits to this minority pressure it will be repeating its clumsy acceptance of minority power demonstrated with the last refusal of classification in the controversial case of Baise Moi last year.  As I wrote at the time, Baise Moi didnt offend the community enough to justify its eventual RC (Refused Classification). In correspondence with the Attorney Generals office, I was able to ascertain that of 419 letters regarding Baise Moi, "approximately 161 were opposed to the film and either sought a review of the Classification Board's decision, or were supportive of the Attorney-General's request for a review, or were in favour of the Review Board's RC (refused classification) decision. But only 27 indicated that they had SEEN the film and of those, THREE were opposed to the film."  Just to reiterate the last point: of the 27 letter writers whod actually seen Baise Moi, only three were "opposed" to the film being released - and it isnt explained why they went to see it anyway, unless it was just to file a complaint. The film was rated R with the following warnings: strong sexual violence, high level violence, actual sex, adult themes. And yet some 50,000 people had seen it in its commercial release prior to the ban being imposed.  The current case of Irreversible is similar, in that the film has been in release since mid February  and the only complaints about it offending anybody have come from people who are professional offendees, not the general public. Since when do such minority views have more weight than the majority view?  "We will obviously be defending this film", said Irreversible distributor Accent Film Entertainments Acquisition Manager Dean OFlaherty. "It is not just the film we are in the position of defending, and this is not just about banning one film, this is about an attack on freedom of speech and freedom of artistic expression".  "While we acknowledge the topical nature of the film in light of recent high-profile allegations of sexual violence, Irreversible depicts the horrific consequences of such violence", adds General Manager, George Papadopoulos.  The film was unanimously passed by The Office of Film and Literature Classification prior to its release in February, with an R18+ rating.  Here are some earlier examples of censorship, courtesy Keith Lofthouse, showing how community standards change and how ridiculous censorship is:  In 1920, Ohio censors tried to ban the classic Treasure Island, for fear that it would lead children to piracy...The Marx Bros Monkey Business was banned in Ireland for fear that it would provoke the Irish to anarchy... The Bing Crosby film Going My Way was banned in some South American countries because the cleric wore a baseball cap...In 1979, The Muppet Movie was cut by the New Zealand censor on grounds of gratuitous violence...And in 1973, New Zealands censor said he would pass Australias Adventures Of Barry McKenzie if one cut was made... from beginning to end.

      And now for a lesson in history.  The 70's were a desperate time for nerds and geeks. Star Wars was still several years away. Computers only existed in TV shows like The Time Tunnel, and even then they were no good for downloading pictures of asian schoolgirls. They Might Be Giants were still yet to discover that people liked plastic foreheads on their real heads. But worse than all of this: Star Trek had been cancelled.  Along came Bjo Trimble and her damned letter writing campaign. Bjo gathered up a gaggle of nerds to write in support of getting Star Trek back on the air. They were successful, which led to a proposed Star Trek 2 series, but instead morphed into the feature films, which begat The Next Generation, which begat several other Trek series of middling quality. Thankfully it also begat 7 of 9, of whom I'm sure we all agree was damn hot.  While I actually don't mind Star Trek, Bjo deserves a very special place in TV hell (next to whomever greenlit  Joe Millionaire ). As a result of Bjo's success, she's spawned imitators. A couple of years ago, the sci-fi series Roswell was cancelled. A campaign from fans sending tobasco bottles got the show back in production. And so, with two successes under their belt, it seems now when any TV show is cancelled, nerds commence their letter campaigns to get the attention of the world at large.   Often, however, when a show is cancelled, it's doing the world a favour. Case in point: Tarzan. Last year an abysmal teen drama appeared on The WB featuring Tarzan in the city, doing stuff. The show was truly inspidly lame and I never bothered watching past the first 10 minutes to find out exactly what the show was about. It seems the entire viewership of the series (all five of them) must have loved the series, as they started a fairly intensive campaign to get the show back on the air. The world at large simply laughed at the dweebs. And rightfully so. The cancellation of Tarzan was a positive move, and  thumbs its nose at those who think a letter writing campaign can save a TV show.  Which brings me to the letter writing campaign I've opted to support. See, we here at Televised Revolution don't believe in lending our support to anything, unless it involves bringing something down. In this case, the West Wing. The West Wing spent four seasons as the most tightly written television show on the air, with dialogue that crackled with every syllabel. That is, until it's auteurist writer Aaron Sorkin was taken off the show by Warner Bros, and instead replaced by John "ER" Wells and his writing team. The show has nose dived into the most painful hour on television. A shadow of its former self.  And so its begat http://dontsaveourshow.org/  An online campaign to cancel a television series. Finally a campaign I can support.

      I'll admit it. I can be a cheap man at times. It's not that I don't want to spend my money. It's more that I'm interested in stretching it out as far as possible. Why buy a DVD or CD at full price, when if you shop around a little, you can generally get it a little cheaper? I like to stretch out the almighty dollar so that I can waste my money on more stuff.  And so I'm looking at the website for the Buffy Down Under Convention. It's a two-day event with special guest  urlLink James Masters , who plays Spike on Buffy, and now Angel. I've never been to a Buffy convention before, but I'd assume they're similar in nature to most fan conventions. You get one of the lesser stars from the show as a guest, with local nerds giving symposiums on assorted nerd-related issues. Local vendors (usually comic book stores and the ilk) sell their wares. Some of the nerds pick up and take home other nerds for the night, continuing their relationship for months over  urlLink IRC , despite living just 2-3 suburbs away. For this, I'd expect to pay something in the range of $60-90 for the 2-day pass. And even then that's being generous.  $240.  I'm in shock. As I see it, there are two main expenses involved in holding an event like this: a location, and paying James Masters to come out for the event. I'd imagine you could get a couple of hundred fanboys to pony up the cash for an event like this, but how can they realistically charge $240? Is this just me being a tight-ass? Or is it a big waste of money?     Last night I went and saw  urlLink Kenny Kramer . Kramer of course being the inspiration for the wacky neighbor 'Kramer' on Seinfeld. Kenny was fairly amusing. He told some anecdotes about Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David?s lives before the Seinfeld series was created, showed a few videos, and played a trivia game with the audience of about 250 people. For this, I paid a concession rate of $30. Full-priced tickets were $37.50. He's an international guest the same as James Masters, and yet approximately $210 cheaper. How exactly does this work?     I considered for a moment that they're potentially celebrities of different stature. I mean, come on, Masters is a very pretty man who appears weekly on a television series with a dedicated fan-base. But then I considered Kramer. I'd wager there's very few people who watch Seinfeld with any regularity wouldn't know that Kramer has a real life counterpart. Seinfeld was one of televisions highest watched series across the globe. And I'm positive that Kenny Kramer has given just as many, if not more, interviews and public speaking engagements as Masters.  For the $240 that I could pay to go see James Masters, I could go see Kenny Kramer, hire a prostitute (I have one as an MSN buddy, and she assures me that it'd cost no more than $150 on a weeknight), and have enough money left over for pizza and a few DVD's.

      Her name is Yoshimi - she's a black belt in karate.  I'd heard a few songs by The Flaming Lips, but had never really focussed on them as a group in the past. And then came january and their appearance at the Big Day Out. As the last act we saw on stage that night, it was the perfect end to what had, until that point, been a pretty average day of music. Sure we'd seen some decent acts like Kings of Leon, Goodshirt, and The Strokes, but once hit with the colour and flair of The Flaming Lips, nothing else really compared.      And so I went Flaming Lips nuts. In the week that followed the gig, I scoured the music stores and picked up a swag of their CD's. Obviously, I wasn't alone in this as it became real tough to find any of their CD's in stores over the next few weeks. The one CD of theirs I wanted that I didn't own was their most recent release "Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots". I was ready to buy it until I discovered the existence of the unreleased in Australia "Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots 5.1". A glorious DVD Audio disc filled to the brim with not only amazing sounding audio, but also with a ton of extra film clips and 'making of' featurettes.    All for under $30 including shipping.  It's disappointing that DVD Audio hasn't really taken off as a successful format yet. The quality of the sound I'm getting out of my surround sound system is phenomonally amazing. It's richly layered and the depth of the sound is incredible. The biggest stumbling block as I see it is the confusing nature of the formats and the fact that it's difficult for the average person to get a grip on exactly what the difference is between DVD Audio and SACD, and how or does any of this really differ from a regular DVD Video? And honestly, despite reading up on a lot of this stuff, I'm not necessarily 100% sure myself.  What I do know is that I've spent far too much money on Flaming Lips CD's, but if I hadn't bought them, I'd have just wasted the money on coke and hookers.

      There's a job I've always wanted, but I'm not quite sure how I'd actually get into the business. Butt double. In Hollywood films, occasionally a script will call for a nude scene. Heaven forbid that an actor who signs on for a role like that will dare to show their own flesh. And so being Hollywood and offering a wealth of available cash for all manner of pointless roles on a movie set,  urlLink body doubles  do in fact exist.  And to be honest, I think I have an okay arse. It's not fantastic. It has some flab, but I'm not so sure that this is going to be an obstacle. While I doubt that I'd be subbing for Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom anytime soon, I think I could potentially score some work by billing myself as a butt double for character actors. The question then is how do I present my ass to the world? I mean, my ass will be out there for the world to see, I'd prefer that I'm looking my best. Yet, at the same time, as a butt charactor actor, I need to ensure my bum will be looking its most realistic. Would it be unethical to work on keeping my rear end looking trim and taut? Would it be wrong to take care of the odd whispy hair or two?     And so, at this point I ask myself the question that all character actors ask at some point: What would Clint Howard do?      Clint Howard is the consumate character actor. With over 150 appearances in a career thats spanned much of his life, Clint has been seen in everything from Seinfeld to Beethovens 5th. Would Clint shave is arse for the screen? I doubt it, the man hasn't become the household name he is by being that shallow.                                                                           # # # # # # # # # # #   As I've no shame. I'll send out a plug for a worthwhile service. And so I mention Gmail, the soon to be launched service from Google. It's just like hotmail, but better. And why? Well, they have lazy people like myself in mind. It's a pain in the arse to actually press the delete button. But Gmail offers so much more space. It's super sweet. I'll never have to bother deleting again. Now I can archive all the add-three-inches spam I want.

      I've had permanent access to the Internet since 1999. Not long, but longer than many. In that time I've seen many novelty websites of varying quality, but these days it has all worn off. Even last weeks The Exorcist....as performed by bunnies just didn't do it for me.  This all changed tonight.  Have I overhyped it enough?  Yeah, probably.  urlLink  http://www.subservientchicken.com

      And so, watch as I begin a descent into nerd country and discuss briefly Star Trek and it's complete inability to rock out.  I've discussed this with people before, so if you've had the misfortune to hear my rant on this, feel free to tune out. If you're one of the many who've had to listen to my theological beliefs on why I won't eat seafood, you'd know better than to listen to me rant twice on one issue.  It'd make your head hurt.  That said, Star Trek, and why it will never get groovy with the rock the kids are listening to.  Anytime I tune in to watch some Trek and they discuss music in any form, they're always listening to a classical composition of sorts. Beethoven seems to be a popular choice among the captains of Starfleet. Sitting back, pouring a glass of red wine, and listening to the piano and feeling rather mellow.   And this is supposed to be our vision of the future of humanity?  Sure, I dig me the classical music. But, variety is the spice of life spaceboys, and just listening to classical doesn't cut it. Why can't Captain Jean Luc Piccard put on some jazz music, or in the very least rock out with The Rolling Stones. Heck, they're in the future, listening to The Kings of Leon would be considered to be old-fashioned music (though, in many ways, that's the case now).   In having seen what could potentially be several hundred hours worth of Star Trek over my life, I can only thing of two instances in which we heard some modern music. The first was in the Eighth Trek film FIRST CONTACT where one of the characters is listening to Steppenwolf's Magic Carpet Ride. While it was nice to hear some actual beats coming from the TV set, it's a shame the films producers couldn't at least have them listening to something a bit more current. But hey, baby steps.  It's the second example that I feel says more about Star Trek in general than any other Star Trek scene in the history of the franchise. There's a scene in the film Star Trek 4 (The Voyage Home) where Captain Kirk and Mister Spock are riding a bus in mid-80's San Francisco. They encounter a punk-rocker on the bus listening to a boom box which is too loud and distresses the other people on the bus. Spock gives the punk a Vulcan nerve pinch, thereby sedating the kid, and turns off the music.  And so the one time that Trek actually explores counter culture, it not only mocks it by acting as though it's a menace to the other decent god-fearing folk around, but Spock goes as far as to turn it completely off.   If that doesn't say it all about the series, what does?  Star Trek is suffering diminishing ratings and it's current series ENTERPRISE is in serious danger of cancellation. The problem as most people see it, is that the show refuses to evolve and actually explore new aspects of life. With our world facing such uncertainty these days, Star Trek would be the perfect venue to explore (through metaphor, as is its way) not only the current political climate (terrorism, globalisation, etc), but also to explore the changes in our daily society (homosexuality, the changes in the family unit, toe socks). Instead, it seems content to be stuck in its old ways of listening to Mozart and pouring the fine red.

         A bit of randomness for today:  *I was just checking out the messageboards at  urlLink mono.net  when I found someone discussing getting started on writing a zine. I didn't realise that people still published those. I'd honestly assumed that came to an end when the Internet hit it big a couple of years ago. Aren't blogs simply the modern day zine?  * urlLink Gentle Ben & His Sensitive Side  are launching their debut LP this week around the nation. I'm eager to go, but few of my friends are appreciative of the Gentle Ben experience. Perhaps I need to find new friends. Surely it isn't MY taste that's wrong.....  *Kill Bill on DVD arrived in the mail for me today. It's just a couple of weeks until vol 2 is released in the cinemas. Can't wait to pop my Bill disc into the player and listen to those glorious 5,6,7,8's in 5.1 sound. They're touring Australia in May. Should be a treat.  *It's 3:22pm. My laptop computer is still yet to arrive at my doorstep. It's been almost a week and a half. Dan is getting frustrated.

      I can't begin to describe the ways I loved this movie. It's been a few hours since I left the theatre, and I still have a big idiot grin on my face.  I could run through the flick, but instead I present to you a review I found on amazon.com:   I almost fell asleep, April 8, 2004 Reviewer: John from London, England Jim Carrey needs to stay from these weird, serious movies. They are all bad, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the worst yet. Clementine (Winslet) eraces Joel (Carrey)from her memory. To get even joel eraces her from his memory. They meet, don't know each other, and fall in love all over again. I think the point was love is love no matter what, but is was a really weird way of comeing to that point. Not only was it weird, it was boring. I almost fell asleep. I felt like I was watching a movie making experiment. (...).   Oh how I love viewer reviews.   Our screening had four walk outs. Maybe they remembered that they were missing Two And A Half Men on TV.

      The L Word is just like lesbian sex. Sure, there's emotion and the occasional warm sensation, but there's just no hard fucking. And dammit, that's what TV needs, it's hard fucking.  Yes, I'm a crude young man and should be sent to my room.  But I stand by this belief. Television is a format that demands that the viewer remains interested for the duration of the program. Both from an artistic and commercial standpoint. It's very easy to be distracted by other things when watching TV, so in order for a viewer to remain focussed on the content in a program, a program needs to keep a decent pace and make the audience take notice.  Deep controlled thrusts.  Instead, The L Word is simply akin to oral sex. Sure, it can be enjoyable if done right, but it's all simply on the surface and isn't probing the characters or situations deeply enough (much like this review I suspect). The L Word writers are still working on their technique it seems. They're clearly not looking for the big release just yet, but the problem as I see it is that they aren't quite sure how to get there when they want to. The characters and situations are just so bland. As a viewer, you can see them unravel in front of your eyes, but there's just nothing actually drawing you into their world.   Sure, they may try to slip in a finger of actual interest every so often, but its withdrawn just as quickly again as they try to move onto the next bland character and situation.     I can certainly understand why women become lesbians. Women are nice to look at and touch. Much like this show. It looks fantastic and could be capable of much more than its offering us, but at the moment, all I'm getting is some clitoral stimulation. I need a show that'll hit my G-Spot.

      Two things I care little for are singles charts and unimaginative dance music film clips.  Catching up with  urlLink Kelly Curvato  this morning I was subjected to this  urlLink masterpiece  which apparently "still tops singles chart".  Whatever.  I'm not going to shit on LMC, especially if they're fighting U2 (in a cage, Christina Aguilera style?).  I raise it only to single it out as an example of the pure mastery that is Blue Screen technology!  Seriously, you'd never know the diva in white isn't actually standing infront of a giant board of flashing lights.  Well you'd never know except that you can see the telltale black cutout line that separates her from her background.  And the fact that the aspect is slightly off.  But aside from that, you'd never know.  I thought music videos for artists signed to major labels were big business?  I've seen better special effects done on a Pentium II with a pirated copy of Premiere.    Well maybe not better perse, but effects easily on a par with this effort.    Like uncreative, unimaginative advertising, poorly produced television programs and evening "current affairs" programming I find slack efforts like this belie a contemptuous attitude towards the consumer.  Eco's concept of the Model Reader suggests that seminal to the creation of any text is an image of the work's ideal reader.  This image is encoded within the text, in the way that it presents and restricts knowledge and the connections between signifier and signified it asks its reader to accept.  This reader is not only contained within the text but enabled by the way the text presents itself to a reader and similarly shaped by the way a reader comes to a text.  Moving to consider television specifically we can see this notion parallelled in Hartley's conception of television as a fundamentally pedocratic regime.  Television appeals to the irresponsible and playful attitudes of its audience.  In doing so, television likewise encourages its reader to approach it as such and find in television an approach to the world bound on ideas of enjoyment.  Television's pedocratic regime does not treat its audience as childlike, but rather that television trains its audience in how to see it, how to respond to it and how to behave like an audience.  Television further is relaint on the audience to come to it - free and consumed within the domestic sphere television has no hold over its audience beyond providing the audience with reasons to engage in the community it creates.  As such, I am surprised when television is disrespectful towards its audience.  Poor production values, patronising advertising and loosely constructed programming reflects a view of the audience.  If TV is happy to turn out such product, then surely the audience could rightfully be expected to respond in a slipshod fashion, as it did with programs such as  Marshall Law ,  Above the Law ,  Witness  and  The Resort  and even Scott Cain.     I wrote this for  urlLink terra is my nation  but thought I'd cross post it here as well

      I have a long standing belief that no movie should be over 90 minutes long. I'll allow 100 minutes if it is an epic. I feel this is fair. If I'm going to pay my $10 admission in to see a film, who are you to dictate that I devote any longer than 90 minutes to a film?  And so this brings me to last nights viewing Troy. Now, the film took close to three hours to tell. Now try asking me what I remember from the film. The answer lies with a couple of sword fights, and at the end they wheeled a big-ass horse into Troy. It was at this point some people actually gasped with suprise. Stupid people are breeding and we can't stop them.    So, in the 180-odd minutes worth of film, I've walked away with very little recollection of what I saw. All I can say was that I wasn't bored. Well, not exactly. I wasn't exactly inspired either. And this, I feel, is the greatest shame of the movie. There's a wealth of material to be mined from the writings of Homer. And instead, all we're given is a tale that is an attempt to bring the audience a film best described as Gladiator meets Lord of The Rings.  Try watching the battles in front of the city of Troy and tell me honestly that you weren't reminded heavily of the third Lord of The Rings film. It was pissweak. On top of that, we were given the exact same blurry computer generated crowd shots that made the LOTR films so uninteresting to watch at times. Contrast this against the other film I watched last night Hero (A film more than a little reminiscent of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), and the viewer can see what a vast difference can be made when you use real people for large crowd shots. Sure, 20,000 extras cost a fair amount of cash, but shooting  2,000 of them in such a way that the audience can use their imagination is surely preferable than being taken completely out of the film due to shoddy effects.  And then there's the musical score. I liked it better when I saw Gladiator.  To summarise: Long films make me sleepy. Films that don't really have any depth or much of a story stretched out over 3 hours make me sleepy and angered. The chick who played Helen of Troy was completely hot. Maximus could have kicked all of their arses.  Troy gets two stars Helen of Troy gets five stars all the way.

       Hilarious, apparently    Taking the hidden camera stunt show in a whole new direction, Ninia Benjamin, Tameka Empson and Jocelyn Jee Esien take to the British streets and adopt outrageous characters to see how the unsuspecting public reacts.   O-kay...speaking with a programmer at the ABC last year I was told this  urlLink program  was coming and was funny; well funny.  I caught it by accident this evening.  Three black British chicks playing up their culture and general femaleness across Britain, sounds like a recipe for hilarity.  Hidden camera shows rely on the ability of a player to draw the unsuspecting passerby into their ridiculousness.  Look, someone doing something wacky to the unsuspecting public.  Hilarity.    But not.  Witness for example the attempt to entice someone to light some sparklers.  When said passerby complied our humble player opened their jacket to reveal a pair of fake breasts, into the nipples of which she stuck the sparklers.  And then the passerby walked off, leaving this lass with sparklers in ther fake titties.  And she just looked sad.  The trick with hidden camera shows is that they require a lot of talent on the part of the player.  The response of the passerby is amusing because the player is the straight man.  Unfortunately these girls, wacky as some of their plans seem, come off as the sort of drunkard you'd get stuck next to on the bus ride home of an evening.     urlLink Double the Fist  on the other hand sounds absolutley hilarious.  I love the  urlLink DIY approach  to television, especially when it's taken out of the  urlLink community TV  context.(whoop! Who's that down there on Chaos TV?).

       Surprise, surprise    urlLink  Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' to be released     Miramax Films says it has reached a deal with its owners, Walt Disney, allowing it to find a new distributor for director Michael Moore's controversial new documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, which Disney refused to distribute. "We are very happy that Disney has agreed to sell Fahrenheit 911 to Bob and Harvey," Miramax spokesman Matthew Hiltzik said in a statement, referring to Miramax co-chiefs Harvey and Bob Weinstein. Under the agreement, the Weinstein brothers would acquire the rights to the film that chronicles America's response to the September 11 attacks and looks at links between the family of US President George W Bush and prominent Saudis, including the family of Osama bin Laden.   Doesn't surprise me at all that this film has been sold on to another distributor.  After the Oscar and Moore's recent campaign it was inevitable that this film would find another Nth American distributor.  This statement confirms my cynicism about the entire fiasco however:   Disney's decision, which it said it had made as long as one year ago, spurred headlines last week when Moore, the film-maker behind 2002's Oscar-winning Bowling for Columbine, went public with it.   I don't mind Moore, I think he is a necessary force in the US particularly.  I do however sometimes wonder if he is no more than a famewhore of a different constitution, especially given the sometimes inaccurate events some can find in his films (particularly  Bowling... ).  Every piece of research is always prone to disputation and the sourcing of alternative evidence and opinions (see the intellectual politicing that emerged from  Blood on the Wattle  etc).  What I find interesting about Moore is that he does not tend to refute claims levelled against his films.  This is a model that worked well for  The Awful Truth  which I always saw as more consciousness raising (or concept framing as the  urlLink Kettering Foundation  calls it) than anything else.  I think documentaries have a responsibility to do more than merely raise issues however.

       I Gonna Fuck You Back to the Stoneage (1989)   Following up on  urlLink this story  that a European crew are trying to lure Mel Gibson to head up Disney I wandered over to IMDB to check out Icon productions.  When I punched in Icon, up came this quaint title.  The record for director Gabi Mathes provides very little information but it does give this  urlLink review:    User Comments:  Jay Lynch Orlando, FL  Date: 17 September 1999 Summary: Pure 'Fuck you back to the stoneage' Genius      I was able to preview this short film at the Sundance festival. I had no idea what this film was about, and was shocked to see that it concerned Michael Jordan and his quest to sign deals with sneaker manufacturers just before he hit his stride with the Bulls in 1992. I was lost in the plot, and I can only surmise that the title concerns his final attitude concerning advertising and shoe manufacturers just before he signed with Nike. A rare glimpse into the motivatiions of an up and coming mega-sports icon. A must see!    The three of us nearby in the office today were all disappointed this film wasn't some Pauly Shore-inspired porno and instead what sounds like a vaguely Michael Moore-esque piece.  Ironic though since Icon was originally in talks to produce Fahrenheit 9/11.

      Last week I told myself to get started on doing some spring cleaning. I cleaned out the boot of my car. The  urlLink wardrobe  beside my bed. And I'm currently working through cleaning out my celebrity infatuation list. The other day I consoled myself with the fact that a relationship between  urlLink JJJ  radio announcer Myf Warhurst and I can never work out. Today I've dealt with the fact that a relationship with Norah Jones would be built too much on my desire for her as a performer and not as the beautiful butterfly that she is.  Much like the rest of society, I've developed quite a love affair with the music of Norah Jones. It is perfect to listen to in the background while surfing the net, driving my car, and spring cleaning celebrity infatuations. Despite listening to her first album more than any other CD I've ever bought, I'm still not sick of it. And honestly, I'd be a little lost without it.  Which is why the relationship would never work.   First of all, can you imagine the pressure that would be put on the relationship if, while driving the car, I put on her record. While she may be cool with it once or twice, there's no way she'd be interested in regularly listening to her own release. The only solution would be for me to not listen to the CD again. And quite frankly, I just feel morally opposed to putting any woman between myself and the art I adore.  And oddly, this is a statement I make while an mp3 of Turning Japanese by The Vapors is playing on my iTunes.  The second hurdle in this would be my own sense of necessity to make use of my available resources. I love going to live  urlLink gigs  to see musicians. Why listen to the CD if I have the artist at my disposal? It'd be a continual effort for me to get her in my passenger seat, crooning away while I drive down to the shops to get a carton of milk. But why stop there? Everytime I walk into a bookstore, or a coffee shop, I hear Norah's album Come Away With Me being piped through the speakers (heck,  at times I suspect her record sales may be based purely on bookstore/coffee shop purchases alone). Instead of just listening to that, why not get Norah herself to sing as I search the store looking for one of the several Gregory Macdonald books that still elude me?  Sure, if one day I find that Norah Jones is knocking on my door. I won't be turning her away. But I know that the relationship is just not meant to be. And for that, I'm wiping her from my celebrity infatuations list. Farewell Jones, Norah. Next up: Mathis, Samantha.

       Children's TV - aesthetic musings  As I am sometimes want to do on a Saturday morning, this morning I woke up to children's television.  Thanks to legislation, original children's programming is one of the things this nation's television system does best.  I certainly enjoyed catching the first episode of Ten's  urlLink  The Legacy of the Silver Shadow   this morning.  Being as production was completed in 2002 I've probably already missed the entire series first time around but anyway, I caught it this morning.  On the face of it, it had everything good children's fantasy drama should - a multi-ethnic cast, overacting 11 year olds, clunky scenes at 'school' and a completely untenable premise that perpetuates the autonomy of said overacting 11 year olds by absenting their parents from the text, leaving them free to cavort around the city at all hours of the afternoon.  I loved it.  It's not quite as engaging as  Short Cuts  but it's probably a step above  Pig's Breakfast .     The story goes that our appropriately diverse motley bunch of students, computer geek Campbell,  overacting  young driving obsessed Gretel, feisty team leader Alex and Josh, the mostly muscle male lead stumble across the secret lair of dead super hero The Silver Shadow, a Gigantor-like fellow who used to fight crime art deco style in the 1950s.  Before he died Silver Shadow conveniently recorded his brain onto a computer (how?) and left it as an AI version of himself, charged to get together a new team of crime fighters should his old enemy, The Crab, come back to terrorise the city.  Living Australian legend  urlLink Bud Tingwell  is in there somehow.  I didn't quite catch it but I think he's bankrolling The Crab and 'cause this is a children's series, he's enlisted the services of his niece Fiona into his plan and that somehow involves her dressing up in The Crab's costume (that odd red outfit) and giving the kids trouble in her Corvette.  It's worth pointing out here two things before I go any further.  Firstly, the production design fluctuates between kickarse (the Silver Shadow costume itself) to piss poor (those bizarre grey outfits the team are wearing??).  Secondly, Fiona can't drive the Corvette.  Everytime she opens the door the car says "Welcome to your self-driving transport vehicle, where would you like to go?" which usually throws Fiona into a fit as she yells at it to "just drive";  urlLink  Knight Rider 2000   it ain't.      So through some convoluted plot the kids end up coming face to face with Fiona.  Josh gets into his Silver Shadow outfit and gets is rump trumped by her crab powers.  The scene was standard stock  Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers  - two costumed buffoons belting crap out of each other in the name of children's entertainment.  When the  urlLink Power Rangers  did it, it was an homage to old Japanese monster flicks.  Through some magic the bad guys grew the size of buildings and many cardboard cities that bore absolutely no relation to the rest of the sets we'd seen that episode were crashed and destroyed.  Watching Crab-Fiona belt the crap out of Silver Shadow-Josh the little-doers down at Darestar  Pty Ltd  and Ponderosa Productions  Pty Ltd   just didn't seem able to recapture that costumed buffoon magic.  They shot the same sort of setups used in Power Rangers, we had multiple retakes of swinging round house kicks and the obligatory waving of robot arms as Silver Shadow copped a whopping blow to the chest but I just didn't believe it.  It looked too clean.    I remembered a lesson I'd learnt years ago watching  urlLink  Dune  ,  it is a skill to direct an action sequence.  Lynch's adaptation of Herbert's novel is sweeping, missing somewhat some of the central ironies of the novel in favour of telling the story of a people finding their messiah.  As intellectually stunning as his direction in something like  Blue Velvet  is, and this is apparent in some of the early internal scenes in the house of Atreidies, Lynch fails to capture the epic sweep needed to convey broad action sequences.  Cobbled by their close fitting,  Batman -esque still suits (costume designer Bob Ringwood went on to design Keaton's rubber masterpiece), this wily band of Fremen fail to look menacing as they charge down dunes.  The lack of sweeping cinematics let down the action sequences.  The same seems to be the case with  Silver Shadow .  It takes more than just clever editing, quirky angles and collapsing cardboard boxes to make action scenes convey action; the blocking needs to work, the characters need to look imposing, not just upon each other but as masters of their domain.    Moreover,  Silver Shadow  stands as another example of the way that digital technologies have killed television.  Granted, with DV you can shoot broadcast quality straight out of the box but you don't get the depth and texture film offers.  Compare Lynch's  Dune  with the Sci-Fi Channel's 2001  urlLink remake .  The crispness of the images in  Silver Shadow 's "action" scenes took away from the illusion of power individual shots of fists and hands can evoke.  The lighting was too high key, even though it was shot outside and much reflected and ambient light was used.  These shots had no soul.  "But DV is empowering, it allows people to make high quality TV on lower budgets"  Sit down you film geek.  DV allows less funding to be given to production companies, for more to be demanded for less.  And this is evident in the fact that networks still don't cough up all the dough for such a production.  But that's an argument about profit margins that can wait for another day.  On Gully's scale I give this program 6 Hasselhoffs.  I'd be happy to catch it next weekend but I won't be making sure I'm sober enough to watch it.  I mean it's hardly  urlLink  The Worst Witch  , the  urlLink TV version  of which I thoroughly recommend with a cup of strong black coffee as a hang-over cure on a Sunday morning.

       Connecting the cultural cringe to here  Appropriately as this is my first article for televised revolution it touches on two of the most endearing elements in my life - women and television.  Its been a week filled with ex-girlfriends, with one former-Ms Gully arriving from Fish Ponds, Bristol, UK, one sending me random emails from Germany, and one turning 25.  But thats mostly an aside.  Collecting the first from the architectural masterpiece that is  urlLink BrisVegas International Airport  I was introduced to former-Ms Gullys New Beau, which was when the fun really began.  Time and fondness made the new-beau/old-beau awkwardness but perfunctory and once that seemingly required hurdle was surmounted discussion moved onto more important topics.    As former-Ms Gully and I sized up the shifts in our respective cultural caches (she still doesnt understand what happened in the final season of  Buffy  but does agree with me that Sidneys costumes have gone downhill in the latest season of  Alias ), New Beau announced hes looking forward to using his four weeks in Australia as an opportunity to immerse myself in Australian television.  Former-Ms Gully voiced her disdain for Australian television, I was forced to face my own internal cringing at the thought of the television this international visitor would be considering our own.  News broadcasts and petty moral panic inducing tabloid journals aside, what is the state of our television he would be judging us by?  Would immersing himself in Australian television involve repeats of  The Simpsons , multiple  Law and Order  franchises and the Toni Pearon lead crime against decency that is  Australias Funniest Home Videos ?    As I got home and flicked on the box I suffered through quality Australian infomercial programming such as  Bright Ideas  and   urlLink Lets Do It   before the Bombers came on to beat the Swans.  Is this the Australian television well be judged on?  Is that the image of here hell take back with him?  Reflecting back over the conversation however I noticed that the programs wed discussed were from a there that didnt belong to either of us.  Absenting a brief sojourn past   urlLink Im Peter Andre Get Me Out Of Here  , all the television we were trading notes on were products of the illustrious Home of the Brave.  On the face of it this does not bother me; as much as I loved  Tales of the South Seas , I maintain a great and unashamed fondness for television from Schwarzeneggers heartland.  For former-Ms Gully however, the high amount of American programming makes the idea was watching television in Australia either reductive or counter productive.  Or maybe both.    What became evident however is that New Beau was excited about watching television here. Regardless of where it comes from, its about experiencing it within the Australian cultural context.  Television is about connecting people here with events there urlLink  .  For New Beau, as a citizen from elsewhere his desire to immerse himself in Australian television bespeaks a want to connect with the here by participating in the ritual of watching television in the rhythm of Australia.  Every national television system is built around assumptions about the rhythms of daily life, and television itself tracks the ebbs and flows of Australian daily life.  This seems an issue often subjugated in discussions about what it is that defines national television product.  This is not to say we should sign away future rights to protect industry as the current Free-Trade-Agreement seems to require us to do.  Rather, I think it is time we broadened our understanding of what constitutes Australian television culture beyond   urlLink Bonanza with Tampons   (thankyou finbar).

         Dear Ms Warhurst,  It pains me to have to tell you this, after all that we've been through, but it's something that has been on my mind the last few weeks. It'd be wrong for me not to talk to you about this. Hopefully we can work past it, but to be honest, I feel that it's time that the two of us accepted the truth of the issue and deal with it. We've been through a lot over the years, but the more I work through my emotions, I've come to accept that it just can't work between the two of us.  I'm sorry. Wipe those tears away Myf. You'll always mean a lot to me. I remember back to those carefree days of old in the winter of 2000. Driving down Coronation Drive, listening to you talking to Costa. Your infectious giggle echoing through the love lorn depths of my heart. You touched me in a most profound way. It was you that taught me to love and feel.  Our relationship progressed. You moved to host the Net 50 show. You were all alone on the air. I was alone in my car. That has to have meant something. Our two souls connected through the wonderment of this technology we call the wireless radiophonic reciever.   Of late however, I feel as if there's been a divide that's developed between the two of us. And I know it sounds like a line, but it's not you, it's me. While once I used to eat up your lunchtime quiz with a sense of unbridled enthusiasm, I now find a lack of interest. Discussing trashy magazines just doesn't bring me the joy it once did. I've grown beyond it. Dare I say matured. And don't get me wrong. I'm not dismissing them as immature. Simply, they're just no longer for me. Much how I've moved from watching Entertainment Tonight to Access Hollywood. It's just something that can happen to a person. Tastes change. Emotional links can be severed.  I realise that these words may sting, and even hurt you. And the thought of that is enough to destroy my emotional fabric. But we have to work through it. We're just not the same people we once were.  Thank you for the good times we've shared together. I think in our hearts that we both knew that our futures were never meant to be shared.  With all my love Daniel

       Big Brother non-Watch:  Day One  The people entered the Big Brother household. Id forgotten it was on at all and found myself sitting through three episodes of 24 and screaming at the TV. I thought the characters on that show were supposed to be professionals. The best of the best. Apparently not it seems judging from their decision-making abilities.  When I realised Big Brother had started, I did change the channel for about three seconds to see Gretal Killeens grinning head. Flicking the button back to my AV1 input so I could watch more 24, I vowed to try not to watch any of Big Brother this year. I always find myself getting sucked into it at some point. If anythings going to draw me into the show, itll be the first Uncut special. I see that as my major obstacle. I do like nudity.

      The Band:  urlLink The 5678's .  Location:  The Zoo , Fortitude Valley.  Time: After 11pm-ish  We'd gotten there late. Had enough time to wander around the venue. Used the mens room where I learnt the important life lesson that a sink isn't just for washing your hands, but it's also a novel place to piss. Thanks drunken cockhead. We bought ourselves some drinks, then headed towards the front of the stage. Just one row of people in, we sat through the non-inspiring blandness that is  urlLink The Tremors .   A sense of excitement-based energy had swept the venue. It was an odd moment to behold. Lets be honest, most people were at the gig having only known the band from seeing the film  urlLink Kill Bill.    I turned to my buddy and remarked "This could quite possibly be one of the coolest acts we will ever see". And oddly, I was right.     Dressed like tinsel christmas ornaments, the 5678's took to the stage and caused the audience to rock and bop like I never thought possible. Am I gushing? Perhaps so, but it was just such a darn cool experience. I started grinning like an idiot.   Which is when things began to get a little rough. Now, I've been to some shows with crowds a little on the tough side. I've been pushed around and battered by the crowds at the front of the stage, so it's not as if it was a new experience. But of all places for a mosh pit to form, with crowd surfers, and a tsunami of people crushed against one another as they push from side to side, a 5678's gig was not where I'd expected it to happen. Those girls seem to do crazy things to the kids.  Should you ever have the opportunity, get your arse there ASAP.  Woo Hoo indeed.

       MOUNTAIN LEAVES ME COLD   In August, the eyes of the world will be transfixed on the television watching the telecast of the  urlLink 2004 Olympic Games  in Athens. Every set of eyes but mine. You see, I'm one of those rare species of people who not only doesn't enjoy watching sports, but I also tend to ignore the Olympic Games.   All of that said, there is one sporting event that does catch me in its grip. The  urlLink Winter Olympic Games . It's one of the few opportunities given to be able to watch winter sports on the television. There's just something about the beauty and majesty of the landscape, combined with the skill and passion of the athletes competing in snow and on ice. It's breathtaking to watch and experience. Other than the Olympics, the only other place to catch this action is while watching extreme sports shows featuring  urlLink snowboarding .  But now, there's also the new WB series The Mountain. Or at least, it could have been.   So, what's it about?  Essentially, it's a family drama that focuses on two twenty-something brothers, their young teenage sister, and their inattentive mother (a philantropist and former Winter Olympic gold medalist). The siblings grandfather dies and leaves the mountain resort they all live at to the oldest sibling: the black sheep of the family who abandoned them all to pursue a life that seemingly involves car racing. Can he keep the family together, while also keeping the  urlLink resort  viable?  For the sake of the viewing audience, I certainly hope not.   Who's in the darn thing?  Welcome to one of the biggest faults with the series. Heading up the cast is the uninteresting Oliver Hudson, the son of Goldie Hawn and presumably Kate Hudsons brother. The dude is almost watchable in this, but at times it's almost as if he is Steven Webbers younger more attractive brother. Somewhat creepy really.  Barbara Hershey plays the family's matrix. It's such a shame that she's such a bore to watch in almost every role she plays.  Most notable is actress Tara Thompson, if only for her uncanny resemblance to Australian soap/teen sensation  urlLink Delta Goodrem .  And finally, former X-Files star Mitch Pileggi puts in an appearance as the shows bad guy, a real estate developed trying to get his hands on the resort. Loved the guy in the X-Files, but so far he's lacked charisma in practically every show he's been in since.   What happens in the first episode?  The grandfathers will is read out and annimosity develops between the brothers, with one of them getting entire control of the resort, while the other has spent his adult life actually running the place. Their sister has trouble coping with the loss of her grandfather, and so drinks a little and almost engages in sexual activity with a young man. Heavens, no.  Not to fear, as by the end of the episode, everyone resolves their issues and they come out of it as a strong family unit.   Is it any good?  I didn't hate it at first. Sure, it wasn't very good, but there was nothing greatly objectionable about it. It has, however, left me with a truly horrid aftertaste. In thinking back on it, the show has no redeeming aspects. The casting was clunky, the dialogue was trite, and after watching the entire pilot, I'm still not entirely certain what the show will be about. The only concept I can see is the real estate developer attempting to snare the resort every episode. Because he's that eager and desperate for it (insert rolling eyes emoticon). Ho hum.  Produced by Hollywoods very own Lucifer McG, the show should at least be able to rely on the stunningly beautiful background mountain ranges and some awesome photography involving the snowboarding daughter in the show. But instead, much of the action takes place indoors, with the snowboard photography being dull and lifeless. It's such a shame to see the shows one extrodinary positive aspect wasted completely.  If the show is to succeed, it either needs to improve remarkably in the first few episodes of the series, or needs an excellent timeslot with a good lead-in. As it stands, I can't see many people eager to make the trip up The Mountain.

       JJ FINDS HIMSELF  The movie Cast Away made millions upon millions of dollars at the box office. Yet, it was never really part of the cultural zeitgeist. Sure, there were jokes about Tom Hanks friend Wilson (a volleyball), but they never exactly made it into a People Weekly 25 Hottest Couples list.  And so, the new telly show by Alias creator JJ Abrams struck me as a little odd in concept. Similar ideas have been done countless times, so why do we need another take on a Lord Of The Flies-esque tale?  But frankly, I'm glad they ran with the concept, because if this pilot is anything to go by, they have a corker of a series. I'm just hoping that the audience never gets.....LOST.   So, what's it about?  The concept can't get any simpler. A plane crashes on an island. The remaining passengers are all remarkably attractive and deal with the trauma of a crash while recognising the fact that they may not be found anytime soon.   What is that huge creature stalking them, and why did that guy just shoot a polar bear?   Who's In The Darn Thing?  While there's no one specifically outstanding, it's one of those great ensemble casts with just a few disappointing folk littering the group.  Heading the cast is Party of Fives Matthew Fox, a guy with a great TV presense that never really made it as big as pretty much everyone else in that cast. Which is a shame, because he really commands viewers attention here. He's lost his trademark 3-day facial hair (but I suspect this may be part of a custody battle with the dude in the recently cancelled series Wonderfalls).  Lord of The Rings hobbit Domonic Monaghan is part of the cast as is TV great Terry O'Quinn  sans  his beautiful and perfect moustache. It's almost as if a conscious decision has been made to leave all signiature facial hair at home for the pilot.   What Happens In The Crucial First Episode?  Well, the plane goes down. Everyone yells and runs around for a bit. Matthew Fox saves some lives. The ex-Iraqi soldier fixes the transmission device, and they climb a mountain for help. And like Alias, it looks like we're in for a cliffhanger to end every episode.  On the subject of Alias, should this show follow Alias' lead and actually allow its characters to radically change, and grow, and all sorts of other opportunities not allowed to TV characters generally, who's willing to bet that they might not necessarily stay on the island for the duration of the show? If they're not off the island by halfway through season two, I'd be remarkably suprised.   Is It Any Good?  Just try and stop me from raving about it. I enjoyed the heck out of the show and will be waiting with baited breath for it to continue on. The show has a few negative aspects. A hotheaded character who is there to antagonise the group is more annoying than a character 'the audience loves to hate'. And as much as I love seeing actor Daniel Dae Kim in shows, I don't know how far they can take his character as he doesn't speak any english.  Although, maybe there's more to that than there seems to be....  This show, like Alias, is exactly what popcorn fun should be. It's a heck of a lot of fun, and it'd be criminal if audiences don't take to it.

      Something I think about  urlLink Wildside .  Wildside is the sort of drama the ABC should be funding.  I don't mean cop shows or serious dramas.  Wildside was a program that was a little to 'edgy' to succeed on the commercial networks because of their inherent confidence problems and business approach to broadcasting.  I think it is the ABCs role to make up the difference.  Wildside conforms to what John Caldwell describes as televisuality - television where style is brought to the fore as a marker of quality.  Max Headroom, Twin Peaks, the Sopranos and Sex and the City are all examples of Televisuality.  It is often loss leader television and the rise of HBO as a place where televisuality is respected is part of an argument about shifts in television and the acknowledgment of style as a brand - the coming of what Rogers, Reeves and Epstein refer as TVIII - television not necessarily constrained by the broadcast form.  But that's another argument...  Thanks to the funding cuts, the ABC only has the funding to produce one high production drama series per annum, which seems counterproductive when balanced against the claims of the early 00s that the ABC should be measured against ratings success to justify its existence.  The problem with the application of such a model is that the ABC is not rewarded for the production of successful programs, many of which it the ongoing production of which would come at the expense of new productions, and secondly, it makes the ABC nothing more than a govt funded commercial network.  In such a position Aunty has no room to produce programs that are valuable, quality, or just plain good television (like Wildside) that would not be funded by commercial television because of the profit margin system in place.  As Producer Steve Knapman suggests  urlLink here , "They [the commercial networks] dont have enough true commercialism to be entrepreneurial about breaking ground on their own network."  Now before we go on to say that the ABC shouldn't be dropping Govt - sorry I mean public funds into productions that only academics and a few geeks who talk about television on the internet will enjoy I would like to pint out that  urlLink SLOU , one of the finest commercially successful dramas of late failed in its first season.  Coming out of  urlLink Big Brother  in 2001 SLOU debuted to mediocre ratings (remember it was test screened to the housemates?).  Ten needed an Australian drama hit with the cessation of their output deals in 1999, the wind up of their remaining product, challenges for their core audience from Seven and Nine, and the abomination that was Above the Law (which was a great show that was marketed badly - more on that another time).  SLOU, the first major Sue Masters project after her high profile shift, needed to be a success for Ten.  Ten gave SLOU an "oncore" screening, running the program over the summer of 01-02, right on the back of its original wind up and supported by their glossy "Summer of Love" campaign.  This also meant the program ran pretty much straight into the second series in 02.  The encore screening constructed SLOU as "the best program we all missed out on the first time", the audience got a second chance to sample the program, the 02 season was a success.    Wildside likewise was a critical and passionately supported success.  It's cancellation points to a questioning of the role of the ABC.  What's wrong with the production of high quality drama that only a few people watch?  Marginal audiences have been the speciality of the ABC since aggregation and equalisation in the 1980s.  But the other question this raises, and this is a discourse present in this post itself, why does successful, commercial television have to be lowbrow?

       SCHLAMME SETTLES FOR WEST WING: TNG   I'm a rather jaded individual. Really, I'd rather not be, but everything tends to let me down. Especially the Adelaide Crows. Not that I really follow football, but I chalk that up to the fact that the team I "support" are pissweak.  But I digress.  My jaded attitude towards television has been only strengthened in the past by viewing TV crud like Family Matters and Dogs Head Bay. For every pure gem like The West Wing, comes along a 7th Heaven, or even a My Wife and Kids. It's enough to make me want to hurl my TV out onto the  urlLink street . But I could never do that. I love the telly too much. I am very much its bitch.  Sometimes, a television show will make such an impact on me that i'm flummoxed. How can this be? Something of quality on the telly? It can't be. Like people, there are some shows that are paving their way to greatness. One such show is  urlLink Jack and Bobby .    So, what's the deal?   urlLink Jack  and his younger brother  urlLink Bobby  are in high school. Their single-parent mother (almost a carbon copy of the mother from Almost Famous) is a university professor who has attempted to instill a sense of intelligence and greatness among her own boys. Especially the younger boy Bobby. What none of them realise just yet is that as they groom Bobby for adulthood, they're also grooming him to become a man that will take on the title of President of the United States.   Who's In The Darn Thing?  Christine Lahti (Chicago Hope) plays the central mother figure, with two newcomers in the roles of her children. John Slattery (Ed) also has a recurring role as a potential love interest for the Lahti.   What Happens In the Crucial First Episode?  Bobby's heading off for his first day in high school. Being a terminally wierd kid, he finds issues with peer group pressure and the desire to be accepted are stronger than thay had been in the past. Jack, meanwhile, has his eyes set on the new girl at school. Their mother comes to realise that she's smothered Bobby for years and it's now time for him to learn how to gain strength on his own, and so Jack takes on a significant role in  helping him gain independence. The first step the family makes to assist Bobby: They buy their first TV set.   Is It Any Good?  Edited with glimpses into future leaders and political commentators discussing the impact of Bobby's life as President, and the path that led him towards it. Each comment is juxtaposed in the past (our present) with a minor event that displays him developing the traits they speak of. While some people may see this as gimmicky and a tad hokey, it somewhat works for the show. Much like The West Wing, it is very idealistic and deals heavily in whats deemed to be the moralistic ideology of what it takes to be the nations leader. Off putting to some, but it more than works for me. The casting is great, and the direction by former X-Files helmer David Nutter is spot-on. It'll be interesting to see how the show will develop, but unless the gods are on its side, I can't see it lasting more than two seasons. Instead, it'll join the ranks  of the many other shows that TV nerds obsess over for not having a long enough lifespan.

       JURY DECISION: GUILTY OF MAKING ME YAWN   My final two years of high school are when I discovered love for the first time. It taught me the warmth and purity that one can feel in life. I'll never forget that first love. The way her beauty touched me in ways previously unimaginable. I was deeply smitten. You see, for it was in my senior years that I truly fell in love with television.  Don't get me wrong, I'd experimented with TV in the past. My parents were open and accepting of my lifestyle choice. They felt it was healthy to allow me to watch TV and indulge in its warm glow. It was a love that took on several forms. Seinfeld, The X-Files, Denton, and the one that has probably had the greatest influence on my television habits since:  Homicide: Life On The Street . Homicide was never my favourite show, and I don't think it ever could be. But while  urlLink Seinfeld  was the last gasp of air in the life of the traditional multi-camera sitcom genre, Homicide lay the foundations for the quality and depth that television would be able to achieve in the years to follow.  While not the only quality show on the air, Homicide provided a gritty, mature, and crisp writing and style that would soon be taken aboard by the next wave of television auteurs. Homicide paved the way for US television to approach a similar grit and maturity that UK series had been handling on the airwaves for years. Much of the credit for Homicide lies with writer Tom Fontana.  Since the cancellation of Homicide,  urlLink Fontana  has moved on to other series such as the Supurb series Oz (currently screening on SBS), and now has a new show hitting the air The Jury. Needless to say, based on my love of Homicide: Life on The Street, I was eager to see what the new show was like.   While Homicide and Oz have done everything right, The Jury has done quite the opposite.   So, what's the deal?  It's quite simple. We follow the jury into the jurors room as they nut out the truth behind the trial they are witnessing. The audience watches them make up their minds, and as the  urlLink jury foreman  delivers their verdict in the courtroom. The final scene of the episode shows us what really happened and whether the jury made the right decision.   Who's in the darn thing?  Every week we have a new cast of jurors. Hopefully, based on this first episode, the casting director is fired. The dialogue, which stilted enough in its writing, sounds even worse out of the mouths of seemingly B grade actors. When an episode of a TV show revolves around a guest star, they can either make or break the show. While its fantastic to see a guest star run with a role completely and make it work beautifully, it can be irksome to see them fall flat. At least then we can focus on the regular cast to carry us through. Unfortunately this is 90% guest actors every week, and in the first episode, nobody's hitting any home runs.  The regular cast includes Billy Burke (who stunk up the screen in the poorly written abusive father role at the beginning of 24's second season), the dude who played Warren in season six of Buffy, and finally (in a pretty clever bit of casting) is executive producer of the series (and well respected feature film director)  urlLink Barry Levinson .   What happens in the crucial first episode?  Some ghetto kids are shooting at firecrackers on a rooftop with a semi-automatic. A kid in a neighbouring building is shot. But is the kid on arrest charges the guilty suspect? It's all very Law & Order really.   Is it any good?  It's a novel concept. Writer Tom Fontana has referred to it as the middle part of his trilogy (Homicide having dealt with the police and Oz dealing with the prison system). The problem with the show falls on two factors. The first is the guest stars. I've discussed this already, but if they really want to be able to sell the concept completely to viewers, they'll need great actors, as well as better dialogue for them. Obviously they're  fighting the shows running time by trying to introduce as much characterisation as possible among the 12 jurors, while also dealing with analysing the case. I appreciate the difficulty in doing this, but they really do come off sounding very hackneyed.  The second problem comes with the concept itself. Part of the excitement of any legal series or movie comes from the exciting courtroom scenes. The very nature of focussing on the jury goes against this. It's almost as if the concept is too clever to deal with on network TV. The discussions in the jury room deal heavily with ethics and analysis of information. By trying to jazz up the proceedings with forced characterisation (a necessity to stay on air on  urlLink US network TV ), it has stripped the show of any real intellectual stimulation. That isn't to say the audiences won't eat this up in droves. I can quite easily see the CSI audience watching on eagerly to try to come up with the correct verdict. It's essentially a dramatic gameshow.  Clearly, the show isn't quite for me. But I can certainly see it'll have its fans.

       CAMDENS GET BLANDER IN SUNSHINE  In middle america somewhere, there's a copy of TV Guide sitting on a coffee table with  urlLink Summerland  circled. Now, hopefully there aren't too many situations like this, or it just proves Darwinism is a whole lot of crap.  The new WB 'drama' Summerland. It's almost as if the  urlLink Camden  family were given a television development deal and asked to create an edgy family drama series. The result is a mix of bland hipness meets bland melodrama.   So, what's the deal?  The parents of a religious family in  urlLink Kansas  are killed saving people from a flood, and so their will dictates that the kids should go to live with their 'hip' aunt in LA, of whom happens to be a clothes designer. The original pilot has her working as a public prosecuter, but apparently that wasn't obvious and  urlLink groovy  enough for the WB audience.  Of course, the LA aunt lives in a sharehouse with three other decidedly bland late twenty-something adults. And so quickly enough, they become integrated into each others lives.  *yawn*   Who's In The Darn Thing?  The show is headed by Full House star  urlLink Lori Loughlin . Apparently she's still a bankable name, as all of the ads seem to heavily feature her name prominently. Go figure.  Australia's own Ryan Kwanten is part of the cast. According to the imdb, he was in Home & Away for a while. Also making an appearance is the bland best friend from Alias Merrin Dungey. She appears to be playing the same role here. Not that I can be bothered to even spot the difference.   What happens in the crucial first episode?  There's primarily character establishment. The parents are killed. We meet the bland adults. The kids get over the emotional issues of their dead parents (of whom will be forgotten by the next episode). There's a hotter than hot surfer girl teaching the oldest boy to surf. The young lad gets all lusty and falls in love. It's all very trite really.   But is it any good?  I'd read some reviews that were remarkably unfavourable. I approached the show expecting the worst. And honestly, it wasn't that bad. Now, that said, it's still pretty far from good. The cinematography is decent enough, and it feels warm and inviting, while still rather fun and vibrant. It's just a shame that the actors and writing all stink up the beach house.

       DESPERATE FOR ENTERTAINMENT   It's that time of the year again. Time to throw that old thing away grandma, and to bask in the bright lights, and whirlwind excitement of the US pilot season. For this is the time of the year where tapes are distributed across the US, allowing  urlLink nerds  to upload them to the Internet so that they, and their fellow geeks can watch, critique, and endlessly bitch about what they've just watched.  With this in mind, I hereby announce 2004's Televised Revolution pilot review season. And I start with the anticipated DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.  Knowing nothing but the shows title, I assumed that the show would be the atypical attempt to appeal to the 35-45 year old suburban mother  urlLink whitey  demographic. The same audiences that watched shows like Thirtysomething and Once & Again with glee. And honestly, I suspect that I was right on the money. It's an audience not quite satisfied with their own lives. Seeking the mature-aged soap opera to escape their existence, yet also seeking a drama to find a touchstone with their own lives.   So, what's the deal?   urlLink Sheryl Lee  is a housewife living the perfect middle-america lifestyle. Suburbia. The picket fence. Perfect husband and child. Spending her days maintaining her house and garden. At least until the day she shoots herself in the head.  But that's not really what the show is about. It's about her female neighbours. Four women all in their mid thirties, dealing with their husbands, children, and how this conflicts with their own wanton desires. And its American TV, which means that primarily, all they're seeking is a good rodgering.   Who's in the darn thing?  This is where it actually gets a little cool. With Laura Palmer herself Sheryl Lee narrating, we actually have a strong cast. The TV geekability of the actors pedigree is high. Felicity Huffman (Sports Night), Teri Hatcher (Lois & Clark), and Marcia Cross (Melrose Place) each bring a strength and strong presence to their roles. While the script serves the shows concept well enough to keep the audiences attention, it's disappointing that they're being wasted on writing that does at times just feel perfunctory.   What happens in the crucial first episode?   Sheryl Lee pops herself. Teri Hatcher gives a poor woman diarrhoea with her Macaroni & Cheese, later setting fire to the neighbourhood sluts curtains. Felicity Huffman jumps into the pool at a wake. And Marcia Cross gets her ass dumped for being an uptight priss. And as any viewer of Melrose Place knows, you don't fuck with  urlLink Marcia 'Kymberley' Cross .   But is it any good?  The show itself lacks charm. There's not really a whole lot to it and it feels somewhat bland in the same way that shows like Providence do. There's enough to keep you coming back for more, but it's hardly a satisfying meal. That said, the cast is great, and it was just a pilot. There's certainly worse ways to waste an hour.

       Donna Jo Tanner to date rape fantasy soft porn in three moves (no fanfic allowed)  After posting news from  urlLink TSSH  about the filming of a Growing Pains II film over at  urlLink the board  I was inspired by my childhood fascination for DJ from  urlLink Full House  to go and look up  urlLink Candace Cameron  in IMDB.  The quality or worth of her 2001 effort  urlLink KREW  (Kids Rescuing Everyone Worldwide) is not really the issue here, I suppose for every  urlLink Spy Kids  there is a KREW or three.  What I was perplexed by was the recommendation at the bottom for  urlLink Kelly Simon: Bed and Bondage   a date rape fantasy soft porn.  Huh?  I know IMDB can be sketchy at times but the logic this makes is a little disturbing.  Maybe if KREW featured the Olson twins...Is this some sort of spam routine going on?  Is IMDB subject to random recommendation attacks?   Is the recommendation completely arbitrarily composed?  Am I the last one to realise how truly dodgy IMDB can be?

       TV terrorism  Here's a fascinating Sunday-morning-on-the-net discovery.   urlLink Michael H  gives us Rarely Seen Scenes, recording some obscura from American television history.    On Nov. 22, 1987, video hackers managed to override the Chicago PBS station's broadcast of 'Dr. Who' for 90 seconds and replace it with a signal beamed from their secret location. Drunk with mad power, the dastardly duo also hacked into a major Chicago commercial station that night for a several moments.  What did said hackers do with access to the eyes of millions?  Well one of them dressed up in a  urlLink Max Headroom  mask and cavorted around before dropping his daks for his also masked partner to paddle his rear.  Michael H seems a little disappointed with this effort, especially given the fact they had the broadcaster at their mercy.  I don't see why.  When you look at the other examples of TV terrorism he presents the anti-Aids protest on the CBS Evening News, Arsenio Hall offering a diatribe about gay-rights activists, Jerry Lewis' stalker and SNL's Conspiracy Theory Rock the best examples are the first and the last.  The Max Headroom incursion and Conspiracy Theory Rock use the medium to comment, challenging producers and audience members to consider their status as producers and audience members.  The other three are a hijacking of live events in ways that have little to do with television itself.  They appear as incursions on the form of television.   By contrast, the Max Headroom prank brings Max Headroom himself to television, moving the events of the fictional character out of the confines of it's designated narrative and slot and making it real.  Max Headroom comments on media control; the irony of the program being that it is fiction, locked into the power structure of the mass media system it parodies.  By making Max real and breaking into an actual broadcast the status of the media system as a gatekeeper of the airwaves is challenged, a point made only more poignant by the fact the attack featured seemingly senseless paddling.    Pity they broke into Dr Who though.  I like Dr Who.  On the one hand there is an added layer of irony in the fact the terrorists disrupted a program not specifically designed for the American television system.  On the other hand however, the scheduling environment in which programs are placed causes a reconstitution of the program to match the cultural environment.  Yuri Lotman's theory of cultural translation suggests that as texts cross cultural boundaries between semiospheres (cultural spaces) they are re-written in the language of the new semiosphere, resulting not in a recreation of the original text but in the creation of a new version, changed by its status in the new cultural space.  As such, the Dr Who that screens on American television does not bring carry the same constitution as the Dr Who that screens in the UK or Australia.  Perhaps its not doubly ironic at all, but rather further evidences the role of media orgs as gatekeepers of broadcast systems?

      I am not a car guy.     I've said it. It's out there. You can judge me if you'd like. Call me a woman. Call me a sissy girl. But, while I fight back my tears as you call me names, realize that it doesn't mean I don't understand a fine automobile when I see it.     Now, those of you who know me well in real life, or even through the  urlLink TV Geekchat web board  (note the smooth subtle plug), will know the reason for this blog update. That's right car aficionado, I'm talking KITT. Knight Industry Two-Thousand.     As reported widely in the media, this week on Ebay, the actual car David Hasselhoff sat in throughout his time in the Knight Rider TV series will be put on auction. Bidding is expected to reach approximately AUS$80, 000. If I had the available cash. I'd have no hesitation in taking it higher.     But what is it about KITT that would make me bid higher? I'll be honest, it's all purely about the kitsch factor. As someone who was never into Knight Rider all that much, it simply wouldn't be about the love.     Is it possible for me to love a car? Many would assume no. If a man can't love KITT, surely the passion for automotive beauty cannot course through his veins. This is not so, constant reader. There are a few vehicles that do have me firing on all cylinders.     I point you in the direction of the finest automobile ever crafted.    urlLink    The Batmobile .           There's no denying that the vehicle redefines notions of what a car can be, but can you imagine the tail you could pick up cruising around in that baby?     The Drew Carey Show in 1997 featured an episode entitled "Batmobile" in which Drew Carey wins a fully working Batmobile in a competition. He eventually forfeits the right of ownership when caught by police making whoopee in the back seat of the car.     While watching the episode, there was something that didn't quite ring true. It was the Batmobile circa the Joel Schumacher era of Batman. Sure, the vehicle was cool, but it wasn't the vehicle that anyone really wants to own. The Drew Carey Show, clearly in an attempt to appease it's production company (Warner Brothers Television), allowed their show to be manipulated into using the current marketable Batmobile. Corporate pussies.     Should the Batmobile ever appear on Ebay, there would be no stopping me. Expect to see me out on the streets panhandling if it'd raise me the necessary funds to purchase this piece of automotive glory.     That said, there's only one other car that could get me that excited.           My Mother the Car.     Blissful.

      WANKING THE AUDIENCE ALONG - TELEVISION'S IDENTITY CRISIS            Big Brother company's latest plan: 'sperm race' TV             Television producers were criticised yesterday over reports that they are developing a reality show in which men would compete for a chance to father a child and then take part in an on-air "sperm race".              In the show, which has been mooted by the company that makes Channel 4's Big Brother, up to 1,000 men would attempt to convince a woman to pick them as the father of her first child by impressing her with their intelligence, sex appeal and fitness.              A second sperm donor would be chosen on the basis of genetic compatibility, and the two finalists would then take part in the sperm race in which the insemination process could be filmed using new technology.              Brighter Pictures, a subsidiary of Endemol, is considering making the programme, provisionally called Make Me a Mum. An Endemol spokesman said details about the show's contents were speculative.              Life, an anti-abortion campaign group, said the show "sounds like prostitution".              A spokesman said: "It's absolutely despicable. It's exploitation with no consideration for the child that may or may not be created. If the child learns that he or she was fathered, not out of love, but for the purposes of a TV programme, that's extremely psychologically damaging."              Remy Blumenfeld, Brighter's creative director, told Broadcast magazine: "There's a tremendous amount of science to this show. It's completely fascinating. It's much more about the rule of science than the rules of attraction."              Brighter Pictures attracted controversy with a previous show, for Sky One, called There's Something About Miriam in which a group of men competed for the affections of a woman, only to discover she was a transsexual.       Yep, uhuh, okay. Not the first time children have been given away for money or entertainment and certainly not the first time money has been exchanged for sex. Is this really about the rule of science however?  What is the point of the competition element?  If the footage is compelling, and I for one would be interested to see the little Thorpies going for their lives, then film it. Make it a doco.    All of which makes me think about the arguments Hartley puts forward in Popular Reality. Part of journalism's saving grace is the way in which it connects the domestic, home bound reader with broader issues in the public sphere. It allows them to make meanings by connecting their experience of the everyday with broader semiotic tools for meaning making. With the personalisation of politics produced by the feminisation of the public sphere and rise of identity politics, previously derided and feminised spheres such as fashion, gossip, celebrity and entertainment reporting have attained more significance. Cleo and Cosmo teach and should be understood as part of the new face of journalism.     In the same sense reality television is a new educative force. Given such, the sort of comments I have made above about the producers being disingenuous about their intentions are on the one hand naive. Such suspicion is, I admit, produced by discourses I perpetuate about the value of certain forms of television.     On the other hand however, I do think that such statements comment on a broader issue conventional broadcast television may be facing. With increasing fragmentation of both delivery and reception channels I suspect the audience (or parts of it at least) is getting restless with the treatment they have suffered at the hands of broadcasters. With the rise of alternative delivery channels, and increasingly it is a matter of alternative acquisition channels becoming available, the audience is finding itself in a greater position of power to choose what and how it wishes to engage with the network.     Statements that something like this are mostly social scientific seem dangerous then as they raise the ire of cynicism. Most everyone in their lounge rooms realise this show is about watching a competition for baby jelly. That is where the excitement, the drama, will come from. Yes, it will reveal insights into the nature of love and the rules of attraction but I doubt if that will be the overarching discourse that frames the way the program is presented and delivered. Big Brother, in Australia at least, does not emphasise effectively in its delivery the fact that it is a social experiment   1  . Given such, it seems arrogant on the part of the broadcaster not to credit the audience with intelligence about the medium itself. It might be a case of trying to sex up the concept by hiding behind the auspices of pop-sociology, but I doubt it convinces the citizen-come-audience-member. What would be refreshing would be television acknowledging its own status.     urlLink     1. In fact, I think it is this identity crisis, between social experiment and competition that results in such a lumpy, uneven and often uneventful program but that's an argument for another time.

       RECOVERING LOSS LEADER TELEVISION   Seeing what I suspect is an aging  urlLink Dylan Lewis  on the trailer for  urlLink Mark Trevorrow's    urlLink The Way We Were   got me thinking about  urlLink Recovery , and once again my musings about youth television have brought me back to considering the role of the national broadcaster.   urlLink Recovery  was certainly a product of its time, which is why it wouldn't be the same now if it was to be resurrected or re-imagined in whatever form. It did come however at the tail end of a time when the ABC invested resources and energy in attracting an audience aged 16-24. As the budget cuts have constrained the broadcaster since, this audience has fallen unserviced and that point is acknowledged by the ABC itself, which is a market leader in children's and tween entertainment, scores reasonably with an audience in their 'middle years' and does particularly well with the Blue Rinse set. Recovery, along with Race around the World, Heartbreak High and to a lesser extent Attitude (which ultimately became a programme adults watched in the hope of gaining an 'insight' into their teenaged children) was the end of a line of youth directed programming at the ABC, the cessation of which was a product of a need to centralise resources and the resounding success of Triple J throughout the 1990s. It seems with the death of these programs ABC TV stopped attempting to compete in the loss leading youth market and instead resigned itself that that was the domain of ABC radio (JJJ).  Since, ABC TV produced programs which have attracted youth have been few and far between, contained in the success of more broadly targeted programs such as GNW, The Fat and The Glass House. The Fly TV development was an attempt to do once again on television, the sort of thing JJJ did on the radio. Of course, the fear of new television developments that is used to justify the raping of the ABC in this country saw money diverted elsewhere when the channel was not an immediate success. This decision was, in my personal view, one that disregards the history of youth television as a site for innovation in television and part of the government's more broader mismanagement of the development of digital television as a medium.  More recent programming such as Cath and Kim has drawn a youth audience to the broadcaster however, for the most part, the ABC has chosen to draw youth to the service through radio. Economically this decision makes some sense, and I'm not going to dispute it outright because, despite it's current misgivings, Triple J has been an important asset to youth culture generally. What concerns me however is that with the cessation of youth programming on the ABC a core place for innovation in television is demolished. Part of the hope for Fly was that it could become such a place, following in the steps of community radio and television in this sense as a ground where new talent could get a sample and a bit of experience in order to launch them into the mainstream. However more broadly, the decline of youth programming leaves televisoin without a key site for the loss-leader programs youth TV slots have typically provided. Double the Fist and Pizza are good examples - like them or loathe them, they are innovations in how to make low-budget television. Crank Yankers and Southpark similarly. Further evidence for this role is found in the experience of cable roll out across Europe, where sport drove cable uptake and music broadcasting (to a degree) the development of programming. Similarly, the innovations MTV brought to the American market (and eventually the world) were in part attributable to the fact they were operating under a profit model that did not require mainstream success.  It seems to me with the national youth broadcaster abandoning to some extent youth programming, the predominant place for innovation in Australian free-to-air television has become Network Ten. It follows a similar model to Fox in the US, a model who's roots ultimately lie in cable broadcasting, and by targeting an audience constructed to be receptive to new ideas, it becomes a key space for the innovation of Australian television. Big Brother, Australian Idol, The X-Files, Rove, GNW, and even Bread are televisual innovations. Granted none are essentially the product of Ten themselves, but Ten is the place for them to appear because it has its finger on the youth button. As much as CSI and 24 are innovative also, Ten has been the Network which has reaped the most financial rewards from innovations in programming. While this last point may seem to contradict my earlier arguments that youth television is principally loss-leader TV, Ten's financial success has come as much on the back of its low overheads and constricted running costs as it has its advertiser success.  The difficulty with this is that it leaves Australia as a site which is not so much open to innovation as it is to adopting the innovations of others. If we were to remove the necessity for the ABC to justify its funding in terms of ratings measurements and instead render its success in terms of meeting its charter obligations, perhaps innovative youth television could return to the ABC as a valuable servicing of the needs of an audience segment. Because as much as Ten sports youth television, the youth programming it carries is programming designed to answer to a psychographic conception of 'youth' rather than a demographic one. Of course, removing the necessity for the ABC to quantify its performance in terms understandable by the entire industry leaves us with the age old problem of determining how it is meeting its charter obligations. All of which I think is about either reconceptualising the funding model provided to the ABC (which will never happen) or reconceptualising the understanding of public broadcasting.  Of course, this discussion, which I suspect loses it's way a little towards the end, does nothing to consider the state of play over at  urlLink Channel [V]  which deserves some consideration as a successful site for youth television on Australian Tele.  The constitution of V is much like JJJ with pictures and herein lies some of its own success.  It also does not move to consider the greater developments in youth programming, namely the emergence of the one hour teen drama as the core genre that has embodied youth TV throughout the 1990s.  The Teen Drama is innovative television, often assuming a role as loss-leading - as much as Twin Peaks and The X-Files are televisual entities, so too Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek have brought innovations of form through an emphasis on style to the television screen.  Similarly, in considering loss-leader television throught the late 90s, one needs to look to HBO branded product such as Oz, The Sopranos and Sex and the City, as well as Push, Nevada and the adventure game exemplars such as Survivor and The Amazing Race.  Maybe more about them another time.

       TELLY COMPAS POINTS NORTH   And so, as my plane took to the heavens, I found myself looking whistfully out the window, just like Harper at the end of Angels in America. With a sigh, I began to think about the fact I was going home. To the familiar. To the ground I'd treaded many times before.  It was much the same feeling I got when watching the new FOX series North Shore. While it was watchable, it felt far too familiar to be interesting. Like getting home from the airport and entering a musty house, you just want to open up some windows to freshen the place up a little.   So, what's it about?  Welcome to North Shore. A ritzy hotel resort on an island in Hawaii. We follow the staff (a bar tender, poolboy, waitress, and the shows leads of whom are presumably working as resort managers) as they find themselves involved in the lives of the patrons at the resort. I much prefered the series when it was called The Love Boat.   Who's in the darn thing?  Seemingly half the cast of Baywatch Hawaii, so already we know that we're going to be reaching new heights of televised greatness. Of note to audiences are former Baywatch actress Brooke Burke, and  character actor  urlLink James Remar .  A perculiar aspect to the series is that one of the shows producers is listed as Chris Brancato, a producer primarily known for working with genre series like Tru Calling and First Wave.   What happens in the first episode?  The somewhat uninteresting and verging on bland lead male actor is quite happy with his life until the day his ex-girlfriend (Brooke Burke) rocks up to share his job with him. Meanwhile, he finds himself being used by the PR agent of a foxy tennis sensation staying at the resort. In other happenings, the pool boy is accused of sexually interfering with a 15 year old patron.  By the end, everyone faces an emotional realisation and leaves the hotel feeling better about their lives.   But is it any good?  It'll likely get a season or two out of production, but it's no more involving than a standard Aaron Spelling piece of trash. The Hawaii setting is its greatest asset, but is simply not being used to its full potential. It's beautiful as hell to look at, but when you consider the way the state was used as a location in the recent film Blue Crush, as well as the TV series The Byrds of Paradise, disappointment seeps in. In Blue Crush & Byrds, Hawaii's people and culture played an integral part of visual flavour of the series. Instead, North Shore may as well just be set on a resort in LA somewhere. It's simply scantily dressed US whiteys as far as the eye can see.  North Shore is easy viewing. But at the same time it's very disposable. I can't see there'd be many people buying DVD box sets in a few years.
