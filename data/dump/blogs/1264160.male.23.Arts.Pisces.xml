      Today I saw three dogs.  The first was when I was on Penn about to turn onto May.  I was at a light and a truck hauling a small trailer passed by.  On the trailer was a cage housing a very large St. Bernard.  The second dog I saw today was in the front yard of a young man's house.  The young man had his back to me and he was playing the guitar and singing to his dog who stood at attention.  The third dog I saw today was a very young dog that was being walked by a very old man.

      Whenever I die, and with God's permission, I will come back and haunt my best friend who beats himself up for being lazy while I went off to die.  Unlike most apparitions who appear white as if to wear a sheet, I will wear a baseball cap, jeans, and green sweatshirt.  Hopefully with the help of others my friend's life will be reviewed on a series of minimalists sets where long emotional soliloquies are interrupted by short one liners.  Off in the dark an audience will sit in silence, letting each word sink in and stopping to laugh when the time is right.

      Man, that is the end of an era. Even though I have long left CFDC by the side of the road I would never have thought that they would deprive any future (and equally confused) youths the choice of leaving the good elements out out of Coca-Cola%99. Now one can only hope for thresurrectionon of thcaffeinene and Sugar extraction machines that dotted the suburban curbsides at the advent of CFDC. What was once a booming business will once again be booming with hordes of Nationals skinny with processed petroleum and free of all cola based stimulants. So don't be afraid America, for the loss of a single machine in a shabby news station break room is not the end, far from it! Nay, this is a new era of progressive change, social unity, and the era of choice. Yes America, raise your golden can high into the air and show your brethren across the shining seas that THIS land is a land oopportunityty and choice! That it is the choice for a new generation.

      I consider myself a breast man.  Say what you will about those who fall victim to breasts, they are usually upper class intellectuals or lesbians who as smart as they want to seem do not understand the animal instincts of the male human animal.  I have always been fascinated with breasts and how their size and shape can draw the attention of men's wandering eyes.  This happens to me.  In fact that is one of the things that first attracted me to my current girlfriend.  Before I knew her well I would see photos of her and wonder what those titties looked like beneath that shirt.  Lucky for me I soon got to find out, and I was satisfied.  My eyes still fasten to shapely set of breasts, however.  I am not stuck with one pair to look at for the rest of my like.  I look at pornography featuring women with massive chests, much larger than I would ever wish to have shoved into my face or wherever, but the idea of mammoth breasts is a fantasy of mine and the pictures and videos fulfill it to the extent that it needs.  Real breasts have taken priority over fake breasts in my early adulthood, perhaps it is the idea of a naturally full figured woman that is a little old fashioned but enjoyable nonetheless.  But in real life I also still look at women and their breasts.  They are hard to hide as the stick out no matter what they wear, and one can almost always tell their size.  Now with modern technology we cannot always tell if their breasts are really that big or naturally that big, but we usually get a good idea.  Yesterday I had lunch with my girlfriend at a local restaurant, I sat down and discussed what I had done that day (and it was not much) and soon our waitress came by our table.  She was a pretty girl, probably about my age or a little younger.  She had a slightly chubby face and beneath the knit work shirt I could tell that she had a bit of a tummy.  It was her breasts that caught my eye, though.  They were very large yet very perky and immediately caught my attention.  Of course this was awkward sitting with my girlfriend, who by no means is ignorant of my love of women and especially their breasts, but I still find it difficult to "check out" a girl in her presence.  But this girl had, what we guys like to call, an amazing rack.  Beautiful and shapely beneath her shirt, perky and pointing directly ahead as if to say "I choose YOU!"  I wanted to see them.  I was not the only one who thought this.  As I sat in my booth my eyes wandered over to some of the male waiters who would let their eyes slip as she walked by.  They knew what I knew, and we all knew it was good.  And so it goes for most men, those who love breasts anyway, and I believe that there is something instilled in them at birth that attracts them to the maternal comforting bosom of a woman's soft breasts that makes us feel at home.  Is it sexist?  A bit I suppose, but it is nature, and who are we to screw with it.

      Some of you already know, but here's the official notice:  I'VE  MOVED!!!  On New Year's Eve, I moved out of my parents' house and into a tiny,  white,  one-room house that is right behind Oklahoma City University (no  commute!).   It's been a huge adjustment and I'm still getting used to coming home  to an  empty house without any voices around but mine.  So, all visitors are  welcome!!  I'm at *Address*.  My phone is my cell, which is  *Number*.  Look forward to hearing from all of you, *Name*

      As my rut is growing deeper and deeper by the day I have found that I am out more and more.  The lack of any decent and/or steady employment within the last year has told me that maybe I am wasting too much of my time on the computer doing nothing.  If I am on the computer I should be editing or making DVD's or even writing.  I have also rediscovered reading, something that I had left by the side of the road many years ago.  In high school I stopped reading mainly because I was always out somewhere having a good time.  Rarely was I ever stuck at home on the computer.  Once college came around I liked to sit around because I had a new computer that was all mine, a fast internet connection, Napster/Audio Galaxy, and all the porn I wanted.  However I would spend many nights fiddling around with stolen music programs writing weird songs that people actually liked.  Or I was editing bad skateboarding videos from footage I had found on my friend's video camera.  I was also still writing, and writing well.  Then I hit a brick wall.  I moved home and got a decent job at a photo lab and things went downhill a bit, but still they weren't bad.  I traded going out every night with staying at home on the internet.  When I got a job at a local TV station I split my days between school, sitting around my darkened room in front of a monitor, standing in a larger darkened studio in front a monitor, and later sitting in a very small room in front of three monitors.  It drained me, I never saw the sun and I got pretty depressed.  Things brightened up for me soon after I quit.  Even though I wasn't making money at my new job I was having a good time.  Then I decided to go for that extra dollar (which very much needed) and took a job at what seemed like a decent place.  I mean, I did this stuff in high school.  How bad could it be?  Far worse, it seems.  As I had matured the job had not, and my adult instinct said that I was far to old to be doing this kind of work!  But as luck would have it I my position shifted and I was in the large sunless back room where swearing and problem solving was always present.  I actually was having a good time AND was making money!  Who would've thunk?  All good things come to an end, and quite suddenly too. As I was transferred with only three days notice I became very angry and hostile to those in charge.  "How dare they give me a secure position and then snatch it away without warning!"  This hostility raged and as far as I know was exactly what they were hoping for, soon I would leave in a huff.  A huff there was, but a leaving there wasn't.  I told myself that I would not fall victim to the wishes of those cruel masters of decision who chuckle behind the tinted windows of their adult sized playpen.  No, I was going to duke it out until one of us broke.  And break I did not, for it was not long before I was confronted and immediately terminated from my position.  Now I am filled with anger, "How could they do this?  They are clearly wrong!" Happiness, "I no longer have to set foot in that place again!"  And despair, "Where am I going to get money?!"  But the next day I found myself in my car bright and early, traveling about the city looking for employment.  I am out in the sun and feeling great, but I am keeping a watchful eye  on those who sign paychecks.  For I know that once I have that first taste of wealth the cycle will start again.  It will start again.

      A dear friend died today.  Scratch that.  A good friend died today.  Wait, backup.  A friend...  No.  A former co-worker died today.  That is all he really was really to me.  Someone I would see at work and rarely any place else.  Sure he came to a few parties and I saw him out in about, but I really only knew him from work. So how does one write about the death of someone you kinda know?  It is pretty hard to come up with nice things to say about someone you rarely spent any time with.  At his funeral I may get up and say how he made me laugh and such.  Not lies, just leaving out certain facts to make his life look a bit brighter than it actually was.  But how often does anybody read this rag thrown deep into the alleys of blogosphere?  Not really anyone I suppose, except for myself and anyone who happens to take an interest in Burl Ives.  So here it goes with my own secret eulogy of Brian.  I don't know when he was born, what he was like growing up, who he dated, or much of what he liked.  I do know he liked to talk, about himself mostly and his experiences at work.  It was strange that we would always talk about work while at work.  Perhaps I should have talked about what he did over the weekend or something like that, something a bit more memorable.  Well I did once, and the story he told is probably my greatest and worst memory of him.  The story that I waltzed into was one as filthy as a Mexican bar and as disturbing as it's kitchen. Strip club were some of the first words out of his mouth.  From the start I knew that this was going to end up bad as Brian was known for not holding anything back.  He described the place in detail, the floor plan, the lighting, the women and what they would do for a certain amount of money.  He first told me of a friend of his, who I suppose to this day will remain faceless to me, who once decided that a small favor was worth his time and money.  However his female service provider wanted more, much more.  She wanted it so much that she gave it to him for free.  He thought nothing of it until months later when he found out from this girl's mother that she was not only 16 but also pregnant.  Brian chuckled at this as he told it.  Laughed at the misfortune of a good friend, and then freely expressed the friend's stupidy. Brian was not this stupid, surely he wouldn't go so far as to participate in this ill repute.  Surely he wouldn't be tempted by women tempted by money.  No, Brian is smarter than that.  He just happens to like titties.  I was taken aback the next part of the story.  Brian, it seems, had indeed taken part in such actions.  Now he never went as far as his friend, so that sad tale was not repeated.  However it changed my view of him.  Strange as that may seem, well, maybe not to you.  I guess you would have had to have known him.  A stranger thing was his love for his girlfriend.  Upon first meeting him he made it clear that he was a man about town.  "Any woman anywhere" seemed to be his motto.  Later he changed his tune, somewhat.  He was always talking about his girlfriend, how he had waited an entire year to have sex with her because that is what she wanted.  He agreed, I guess.  Although the blowjobs for money I guess didn't count.  But it actually seemed that he loved this woman in his own strange way. I guess you would have to know him, and really, I guess I would have know him as well.  As strange and vulgar as these actions seemed, they made sense (as did many other things) to Brian.  He was his own man.  "He didn't take shit from nobody" I guess is the phrase commonly used to describe people like Brian, but it is true about him.  He didn't let what people thought of him get in the way of what he thought about himself.  He live fast and died young, and boy did he have a great time.

      It is a little after 1:30 in the morning and I find myself watching Roseanne.  You must understand that I feel that sitcoms are some of the greatest things to the arts.  Each week there is essentially a new play that you are watching at home.  Each episode done before a live audience and each show must be more watchable than the show on another channel.  To be able to compete with another show of the same caliber is a feat.  Take for example the Simpsons vs Cosby.  Yes I know that the Simpsons was an animated program and therefore different of sitcom, however it is a great example of the wars going on in television.  Cosby was the height of 80's television sitcoms.  Well written, well acted, very good show all around.  Then the 90's were ushered in and needed a new mascot.  It was the Simpsons.  Fresh, witty, and a totally new format.  It was a clear choice.  Roseanne is strange, though.  Whereas most sitcoms deal with those families living in rich areas and are pretty well off.  But Roseanne was different.  She and her family were middle to lower middle class.  Not totally poor but far from rich.  So there was something about her wit and the storytelling of the show that kept viewers watching for so many years.  It is a strange phenomenon.  It doesn't warrant a post, usually, but this is Burl Ives you are reading.

      As I am trying to get more work and therefore more money I find myself falling into some things that may be promising.  As Russell and Dinger now work for quite a bit of cash I may eventually find myself in their shoes working for the same man as an editor.  In the mean time, however, I was offered a job directing a documentary on noodling.  Now there has a been a documentary that has received great press on the same subject, in fact the project was offered to the very many who directed that documentary.  But it was his asking for up front money that made this man look for an alternative.  Lucky for me I am still quite the amateur hardly doing enough work (or any for that matter) to call myself a professional.  My willingness to work for no up front money made me the prime candidate this endeavor.  My duties will include producing, editing, writing, DVD design, package design, distribution, and website design.  A lot for no money, however it is his partnership with Bass Pro Shops that caused my ears to perk up.  They guarantee that his videos will be place in their store so there will be a considerable amount of money to be made.  I have also been told by Russell that the man who is paying him so much money may very well be interested in investing into the noodling video.  I have told the noodler that such an offer may be offered and am waiting for a reply of interest so that I may further inquire upon getting some mad bling.  To the future.  To beyond the stars.  For the race beyond the galaxy!

      I wet to the Civic Center in the downtown area of my hometown tonight to go see a production of "Stomp."  Now, had this been 10 years ago I would have wet myself if I had given the chance to see this performance at all and especially for free.  However the fact that it was free was the only reason I went at all this time.  Then novelty has worn off over the years.  Sure it was enjoyable, but not $40 enjoyable.  There was also kind of a cheap feel to it.  I remember before the renovation of the Civic Center, when the art decco design was still left over.  Although slowly falling apart it did make me feel as if I were attending a grand affair.  Standing in the lobby with the beautiful carpet and light fixtures.  Sigh.  Now the lobby resembles a very large movie theater with reds and purples and glass.  To  now  for my tastes.  The outside is still quite nice.  It was left untouched except for just beyond the the bottom step, a drop off area was installed.  Yes it used to be so much nicer going to the theater when I was a kid, I would dress up nice and it was an actual evening well spent.  A good 3 hours at least watching live actors on stage presenting a story that hopefully kept your interest.  And if it didn't you would have a sack of tomatoes.  There were many people in t- shirts, even the rich folks who chuckled on the floor and in the boxed seats.  Beside me was a very big woman and I was surprised she wasn't wearing a t-shirt that featured some Loony Tunes character.  Sadly her shirt was striped.  But who are these people going to the theater.  Eh, at least there is something going on, and at least there is the movie theater at the art museum where they play just about everything that doesn't come to the big theater (which is a lot surprisingly).  Going to that theater is a much grander affair in my opinion and with such a smaller crowd too.  Oh well, maybe one day I will get to be rich and in my own way revitalize the notion that you put on a tux or at least a good suit to see a live performance.

      Only a few weeks after being unemployed I feel the freedom felt by my friends who have gone the way of finding themselves.  At times I may seem to not care about having money, but it is not that at all.  I feel the need to break the chains of those jobs that have held me back for so long.  Those who today received large sums of money for doing very little but doing it well have inspired me to do something.  I will do it, and do it well.  Cap'n calls me today after I confront Teddy about his absence from the task at hand.  Only after concern of my anger will he call.  Too late, I am on my own.  I need to be free.  Soon I will be working again, soon I will have money, soon I will be totally free.

      Yes, I used to be a slave to the Livejournal world.  I scoffed at the much more tech headed blog world for many years thinking that the more bare bones approach to displaying your innermost thoughts to the world was pretty ridiculous.  I went through all the whole thing, I made friends, I lost friends, I got fumed at what someone wrote, I have experienced two relationships (one directly one indirectly), I have experienced a breakup and the drama that follows.  Which led me to the blog world finally after four years.  It is essentially the same thing, but you really have to look to find new things.  There is no friends page for you to have a quick look at who said what.  If someone wants to comment, they must go out of their way to do so so you must have done something terribly wrong.  It is a bit more peaceful here, though I will be pleased when someone finally finds me.  And then more pleased when whoever that is finds what I have to say interesting.  One thing that happened when I left livejournal and became a true member of blogosphere was that my posts became a lot longer.  Usually I would just hash out some one liner that I thought was funny, or a quick description of something I thought was funny.  A lot of really obscure things that nobody  but me got.  There is some evidence of that that has carried over here, but whereas most of this blog consists of longer posts that are usually about me and only a few quick witted posts, the LJ was the complete opposite.  I knew the people who read my stuff and knew that first of all they didn't care about what I thought on anything (I had tried it and only angered many of them), and secondly I really didn't want them knowing about what was going on with me.  That is essentially why I left the whole LJ biz and found a nice piece of the Bridge.  I do miss the community aspect somewhat, I do miss some of the people I talked to on a regular basis.  But they all left before me so all that was left were my friends that I knew in personally and what was the use of talking to them online in a forum environment?  So I ended Livejournal.  Though I will try to stop the strange and short posts, I  do feel the urge to continue one tradition that I adopted later in my endeavor.  That is the announcement of the deaths of celebrities.  Nothing too special, just a quick note of who it was and that they had passed.  A quick goodbye from one who knew their work but not them personally.  Now that the long (see, already different from LJ) explanation is over, I will now begin my new tradition starting with the next post which will soon follow.

      What haven't I talked about?  A lot it seems.  A lot has happened since the last time I squawked some random message into my phone.  The first thing I feel about writing about is me seeing Will Oldham and Bonnie 'Prince' Billy in Denton, TX.  A great show, met my hero, nice guy.  I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to go seeing that I had absolutely no money.  I got some money, then Mike backed out, the Randy said he would take me, then he decided he didn't want to go, then Lacey decided to drive, then Randy came.  All good, at least I got to go.  We also stopped into a porn shop on the way back.  Awsome.  And speaking of no money, I am still waiting on that fishing thing to start.  In the mean time my unemployment was approved so money soon.  Russell, Dinger, and Q Bean got fired from the storm chasing documentary.  The dude also lost an investor.  But getting an investor is easy for this dude.  Anywho, he by chance calls up the company where my girlfriend works and just happened to get ahold of her.  She went to his website and realized who he was, he explained his situation and she mine and now he wants to talk to me.  So, I could get Russell's job for which he got fired for being stoned all the time.  Anyway, if I get on this I am going to be making a lot of money.  New car, new place, new clothes, new equipment, new school, new work, pay dad back for old equipment.  I will have it made.  Done    *some things not included

      I am a fan of Jandek, so I was very happy when  urlLink Jandek On Corwood  was announced and I have been following its progress since its first announcements.  Now this film is touring and I have missed each and every showing.  We have a faily active film scene here in Oklahoma.  The downtown art museum offers a great mix of films that usually don't hit our mainstream theaters (although you might be surprised what hits our mainstream theaters here, a lot of really great stuff).  However the museum has been reluctant to show Jandek On Corwood for some odd reason.  There is hope, however.  In Norman, OK there is an organization called BOFFO.  It is an organization that usually showcases local films however they do occationally get one from one of the coasts.  Since it is very popular now I figured I could set up a screening through BOFFO.  I have e-mailed both parties (along the way getting Jandek On Corwood director's home phone number) to which they have both agreed to show the movie.  Now I have passed each of their info on and I hope it will be set up soon.

      Let us never forget that the appropriation of Arab resources  brings forth  the slaughter of thousands of children by Air Force cluster bombs. As Norman Mailer pointed out, the deal between the Department of Defense and Halliburton unit Kellogg, Brown & Root brings about  the theocrat Ashcroft's suspension of our civil rights. Clearly, a minority of warmongers and apologists  represents the repudiation of international law in order to bring about  the essential Western imperial interests. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the unstated purpose of this war is determined by capitalist interests which lead to the police state which has come to pass.  For one thing, the American state, with its unelected president, venal Supreme Court, silent Congress, gutted Bill of Rights and compliant media  brings about  an act of international violence that exceeds even those of the "liberal" Bill Clinton. On the other hand, a minority of warmongers and apologists  is solid evidence of  the result of a pre-fascist atmosphere in America. Presumably, the influence of Leo Strauss represents the crushing of internal dissent in order to propagate  the end of any possibility of social justice in a reactionary state. Let us never forget that the unstated purpose of this war provides a pretext for  an oil war masquerading as an endless crusade against "terrorism."   On the other hand, the appropriation of Arab resources  provides a pretext for  an oil war masquerading as an endless crusade against "terrorism." Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Bush’s argument for war is solid evidence of  the resurgence of White Supremacist ideologies. This suggests that the American state, with its unelected president, venal Supreme Court, silent Congress, gutted Bill of Rights and compliant media  brings forth  the predatory imperialist aims outlined by the crypto-fascist Project for a New American Century. Nevertheless, the influence of Leo Strauss is determined by capitalist interests which lead to this calamity brought to us by a horrific onslaught, known as Shock and Awe.   Clearly, the unstated purpose of this war represents the repudiation of international law in order to bring about  the theocrat Ashcroft's suspension of our civil rights. Presumably, the pro-Sharon neoconservative cabal brings about  the result of a pre-fascist atmosphere in America. It is quite remarkable that the Pax Americana of the future  provides a pretext for  an act of international violence that exceeds even those of the "liberal" Bill Clinton. It appears that Bush’s argument for war leads our attention to  the final subjugation of the Middle East, beginning with the $90bn invasion of Iraq.   Nevertheless, the 15-minute speech delivered Monday night by President Bush  leads our attention to  the seizure of the Iraqi Oil Ministry. As Norman Mailer pointed out, Bush’s argument for war represents the crushing of internal dissent in order to propagate  the resurgence of White Supremacist ideologies. Perhaps for the first time since the late 1940s, the influence of Leo Strauss is solid evidence of the theocrat Ashcroft's suspension of our civil rights. This suggests that the pro-Sharon neoconservative cabal is determined by capitalist interests which lead to the police state which has come to pass.   -Random words put together by The Lefterator: A Leftest Cant Generator   http://www.spinline.net/cy/lefterator.pl

      My 25th permanent post, a milestone.  The new fishing documentary (which I am calling "I Am A Fisherman 2") is running although not so smoothly.  I have some great footage however I don't have them catching any fish over 4 lbs.  Yesterday I met the guys in Tischamingo(sp?).  Seeing that it was so close to Texas I decided to cross the border to feed my face with gambling, pornography, and alcohol.  Texas Budweiser is much better than Oklahoma Budweiser.  I bought some lotto tickets for the $145 million jackpot.  So far nobody has claimed it so it may reach a insane amount by next week.  I might have to make another trip to Texas.  On the way back I went by Winstar.  What an amazing place.  I was used to Indian casinos being like Lucky Star (top of the line) or Thunderbird (low end).  Winstar surpassed Lucky Star.  First off they had a carnival next to the casino.  They had 3 restaurants, two giant rooms, a high stakes room but no tables.  Fuck that.  It was amazing to see though.  I am, although my girlfriend doesn't much like the idea, growing my beard out for my best friend's wedding.  Since I am the best man I will be in most of the photos.  I am trying to show up my girlfriend, she hated the idea of me having a goatee yet liked it when I sculpted it.  I have been taking care of my beard a lot more, washing and brushing it every day.  Speaking of beards, there are some dudes in NJ who are not shaving for an entire year to raise money for cancer research.  They gave me a wonderful idea.  I would like to do that.  My girlfriend would hate that though, but it would be for a good cause.  I would raise money for Smile Train which is a foundation that sends doctors to third world countries and operates of people born with cleft lips and palates.  Being that I was born with a bilateral cleft in both my lip and palate it would be the perfect charity for me.  Also that my folks give a lot of money to it helps being already being heavily involved.  It could also be an opportunity for me to get my name out as a film maker, especially if I make a documentary about my  year.

      The Entire Project Of Jut The Samoleons.  A phrase that I mistyped on a message board has turned into titular brilliance.  See above.

      Just as things were looking up (job interviews, caught some fish, etc.) life deals me a shitty hand.  First, since I did not know where I was going yesterday I did not get to get any sunscreen.  I was out on a boat all day.  Some great footage, but I am burned as hell.  Just a few short hours ago I was about to leave my house for Jen's when I walked up to my car and noticed that the window had been busted out.  However my dad is now talking about selling it which would mean me getting a new car.  Maybe good fortunes.  Maybe.
