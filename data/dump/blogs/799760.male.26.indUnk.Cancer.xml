       I watched the MTV VMA's last night and boy oh boy did they stink!  Minus his opening bit, Jimmy Fallon was not funny at all.  The show was very tedious and boring.  Then, at the end, they announce that after trying to get them to appear for four years, they finally got Guns'N'Roses!  So I'm thinking to myself, 'Wow, a G'N'R reunion?  This may save the show!'  Some fucking reunion!  Where was Slash?  Izzy?  Duff?  There was Axl, Dizzy (the keyboard player, so that doesn't really count) and then a bunch of nobodies!  What a crock!  Axl's voice is pretty much gone.  He was running around the stage and getting all winded, he could barely complete a single sentence.  Pathetic.  Then to top it all off, the MTV talking heads are rambling about it being a 'historic event'!  Please!  Slash coming back would be historic, this was just a bastardized version of a once great band.  MTV should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass that crap off on the viewing public.

       Again, I realize that there's probably no one reading this...but if you are I put up a brief (hah!) overview of my sad, pathetic 24 years of life for you to peruse and laugh at.   urlLink Click here  to read it, especially if you enjoying rambling longwinded pieces of prose (is prose only fiction or is it any writing?  I can't remember).

       Well, here it is...my first post to my website.  Wow, I'm getting chills.  I actually have no idea why I even need a website, but it seemed like a good idea so here it is.  And yes, I do realize that the likelyhood of any more than one or two people stumbling across this site is slim.  I think this site is going to be more about giving me an outlet to say things I wouldn't otherwise get a chance to say.  Scary thought.

       Labour day weekend has come and gone and I did absolutely nothing.  well, thats not completely true.  Friday I drank, Sunday I drank and Monday...I drank some more.  Sometimes I wonder if I don't maybe drink a little too much, but really I don't have anything else to do.  Sad isn't it?  I mostly drink to get drunk, which is probably some warning sign of alcoholism but oh well.  At least I don't drink alone.  If I ever start doing that, then I'll start to get worried.

       ha ha...I knew I'd never bother updating this thing even before I started it...so why did I start it?  oh well...maybe I'll actually try and update this thing every now and then...maybe not...  September 11th...I felt really really weird Wednesday, like there was some dark cloud hanging over me or something.  I felt really helpless and weak, which is pretty stupid now that I think about it.  Hell, I don't even live in the US, what do I have to worry about?  Who's going to attack Canada?  But I just felt a bit depressed...maybe it was just general depression...anyone know where I can get some prozac?  I remember listening to Howard Stern (more on Howard some other time) talk about how he could have banged Pamela Anderson, when all of a sudden they broke the news about the crash and I was in disbelief...then the second plane...but the worst was when the first tower collapsed...I was in my car on my way to take my grandmother somewhere when it happened...I started to cry while I punched the steering wheel over and over and over...one of the worst feelings I've ever had in my life.

       so...I'm going to Florida tommorrow and you're not!  ha ha ha  But seriously, apparently there's a hurricane brewing down there in the gulf of mexico which could make things slightly unpleasant...guess I'll just have to get even more shitfaced to compensate!  I pretty much expect to be drunk from the time the plane lands in Fort Lauderdale until the time I wake up Tuesday morning (except for Monday afternoon when we'll be driving from Miami to Tampa, but I'll get drunk as soon as we get to the hotel so that's ok)...can't see us hanging out much in South Beach or anything though since my wardrobe consists entirely of shorts, jeans and t-shirts...that's it...don't think I'd fit in too well with the uber-trendy club crowd down there...kind of curious to see what the nudie bars are like down there...I heard a while ago that when you're getting a lap dance, they're not allowed within 3 or 6 feet or something???  that's ridiculous!  oh well, only one way to find out I guess.

       I've decided I have social anxiety disorder...I was thinking about how screwed up some of things I do are, and some of the things I say are and it social anxiety disorder sounds almost exactly like what I've got.  For example?  I've been talking to this awesome girl over the Internet for the past month or so...2 weeks ago she gives me her number and I call her, we talk for about an hour and then I never call again...why?  because I got so worried that if I called I'd say the wrong thing or she'd think I was pestering her or whatever, so much so that she wouldn't want to meet me.  Thinking about, I knew it was ridiculous and that she was probably waiting for me to call back, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  So now, I've pissed her off and freaked her out (since I tried to explain why I hadn't called), so...yeah, I fucked it.  Just nerves you say?  How about this?  My buddies' wedding in July, I'm talking to a guy who used to be my best friend in elementary school who I hadn't talked to in a long time...he tells me he's going up to a cottage the next weekend with a few guys and would really like it if I'd go...I was a bit nervous but I said sure and said I'd call to work out the details...did I call?  Of course not! Why you ask?  BECAUSE I AM A FUCKING MORON!  And it goes on from there...why did I fuck up in university?  Because I was so god damned nervous about everything and introverted that I couldn't admit to anyone that I needed help!  Why did I have no friends all through high school?  Because when I changed schools and didn't know anyone anymore, I couldn't make any new friends because I couldn't get the nerve up to actually talk to anyone!  Why am I 24 and never even been on a date?  Other than the fact that I'm a fat slob that is?  Because I have absolutely no self-esteem, and apparently have no balls....so now that my self-diagnosis is complete, what am I going to do about this?  In all likely hood nothing.  Christ, I haven't even been to the doctor, not even for a checkup or anything, since my first year of highschool, which was 10 years ago!  And you think I'm going to go to a shrink?  Not bloody likely.  No, I'll probably just wallow in my self-doubt for the rest of my life...probably end up drinking myself to death, who knows?

       woo-hoo, I'm going to Florida in 4 days!  me and two friends are going down for the weekend to see two football games....my Dolphins on Sunday and then my buddy's Bucs on Monday Night Football!  I don't really know what to expect other than a good time.  I mean, there's no sporting events like NFL football here in Canada, the Argos are lucky to get 20000 people, while there will probably be around 70000 at each of the games this weekend!  And then there's the tailgate parties!  I have no idea how this stuff works?  Do you just walk up and say 'hook me up with a burger'?  Unbelievable!  The plan right now is to try not to be too too shitfaced before the game starts so I can remember most of it, but that could be a difficult proposition, especially if we somehow find ourselves at a tailgate party.    Oh well, as the Purple Rabbi says, 'Whatever happens, happens'.  Hopefully the Dolphins will kick the living shit out of those damn Jets, who've won the last 8 in a row against the Phins.

       what's this?  a post on two consecutive days?  jesus, I must be sick!  or just extremely bored...  Summer is over, finally.  I hate summer, it really really sucks.  I'm the kind of person who prefers the cold.  Plus, I sweat profusely, and the summer heat doesn't make this embarassing plight of mine and more tolerable.  I mean, I sweat walking up a flight of stairs, getting out of bed, I probably sweat just from breathing!  I don't know why either...I mean, I know I'm in bad shape but this is excessive!  Anyways, I also like winter because we get rid of god awful baseball and replace it with two REAL sports, football and hockey.  For the life of me I can't figure out why the hell people still watch baseball?  Its so god damn boring...sitting around for 3-1/2 hours or whatever just to watch guys stand around or scratch their balls, with the occasional bit of action thrown in here or there, ooooh, sign me up!  Re-reading my past posts, I've noticed there isn't any sort of over-arching theme to all this, it seems to be more about me bitching and complaining about whatever I feel like...which is fine by me since no one but me is reading this crap anyways.  BTW, here's a non-complaint for you: buy or download the album by Sparta, 'Wiretap Scars'...amazing!  That and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's self-title album!

       Another day and I still feel like shit...don't if its the weather or what...although now I'm getting headaches and nausea, unlike before...plus now my sore leg, which had been getting better, hurts like hell again...how did I hurt my leg you ask?  well, let's just say that me, alcohol and a dance floor at a wedding are a dangerous mixture, apparently I was doing my best James Brown impression, jumped in the air, came down and my leg just buckled...oh well!

       I feel like shit...I don't have a cold or headache or anything, just a general malaise...maybe I'm depressed or something, I don't know...don't really know what to do about it either.  Before I went to Florida I'd pretty much made up my mind that I had to go get some help for my multitude of problems, even if it was just to a regular doctor to at least get some advice or something, but I'm not so sure now.  I don't know why I've changed my mind, and nothing in my life has really changed, I'm still as fucked as before.  Don't know if its because I'm worried about what they're going to tell me or what...I haven't been to see a doctor since my first year in highschool which was 1992!  Why the fuck is Edge102 (a radio station in Toronto for those not from 'round here, like anyone is actually reading this anyways) playing Eminem?????????????????  This is supposed to be the 'new rock alternative'?  If they're running out of stuff to play, why not play some less well-known bands like Thursday or Sparta or Trail of the Dead, anything but Eminem!  I mean, I know there's been a lot of this rap-rock crap being played lately, but that's going too far dammit!  ARGH!!

       I've been back from Florida since Tuesday but only now have gotten around to updating this damn thing...anyways, Florida was pretty good, the football was awesome (GO DOLPHINS!) but the other bits weren't as good as I expected.  For one thing, most of Florida seems to be pretty run down, our hotel in Fort Lauderdale was pretty much in the middle of nowhere so there weren't any bars or anything around, and our hotel in Tampa stank!  Stank as in smelly stank, not as in crappy although it was that too.  I'd definitely go down for a game again, except next time I'll stay on the beach, more to do.  We only made it to one strip club, and it was pretty shitty.  I can't understand why clubs that are totally nude can't serve alcohol?  It makes no sense, do they think just because you have a beer you're going to go nuts and start attacking all the women?  Christ, most of the people there were probably already drunk when they walked in...plus something doesn't seem right about spending $6 for a fucking coke!  I don't particularly like spending $6 for a beer here, but a least its a beer and I get to see everything with my beer!

       Hockey season is back!  Leafs won big last night (true it was only the Penguins they beat, but still) and as a result I feel very good today.  Kind of sad in a way though, that one of the only ways I get any pleasure in my life is by a hockey team winning...*sigh*, don't feel as good now.  Thanksgiving this weekend (for you non-Canadians, if anyone is actually reading this that is, we have ours in October, not November like Americans)...not really big on the whole family turkey dinner thing, particularly since its going to be on Sunday afternoon and I'm going to be missing some prime football action...and its not like anything really happens anyways...we get there, sit around until its time to eat, eat, then go sit around some more until its time to go home, not really the best family bonding or anything...although I don't dare complain about it...I've mentioned how I don't agree with the way some of these family things go in the past, and I've learned that its much easier to just suck it up and go with the flow, otherwise I get frosty looks and get into arguments and other nonsensical bullshit...I'm not big on confrontation, not with friends, strangers and especially not with family.  that's nothing to really be proud of I guess, I mean it would be good to have some sort of backbone but what can you do?

       Is there anything better than the Anaheim Angels  urlLink Rally Monkey ?  Now, I'm not a baseball fan, in fact I think its the worst, but if anyone asks me who my favourite ball team is, from now on I'm definitely an Angels fan!  I love Alice in Chains...yes I know the lead singer is dead, and they'd been broken up for a long time and its not the 90's anymore, but still.  Is it just me or were they one of the most underrated bands to come out of that whole Seattle grunge scene?  That MTV Unplugged they did was absolutely unbelievable...Nutshell, Angry Chair, No Excuses, Would, Stay Away, some awesome awesome tunes...

       Woo-hoo, the Dolphins beat the Pats!  1st in the AFC East!  Spent the whole weekend watching football, college Saturday, NFL Sunday...I'm just starting to get in to college football, don't really have a favourite team or anything yet, just like watching...seems more fast-paced than the NFL with more momentum changes and more explosive plays...don't really know how I'd pick a team though since I 1) never went to any of these schools or 2) don't leave near any of them...two of my friends are Notre Dame fans, but I'm not really sure why...come to think of it I don't even know how I became a Dolphins fan, I mean if anything you'd think living so close to Buffalo I'd be a Bills fan, but luckily that isn't the case.  Way back when I used to be a Bears fan...but somehow my allegiance just shifted...odd isn't it?  I feel like crap once again, don't think its really from being hungover though, probably has more to do with the fact that I woke up at 3am and couldn't get back to sleep no matter how much I tossed and turned...I'm coming to the conclusion that there's something seriously wrong with me

       Leafs won last night 5-3, good shit!  The standing room tickets weren't as bad as I expected, could see everything fine (had to lean forward a bit to see the scoreboard, but no big deal), only complaint is the no alcohol thing which doesn't make too much sense, since the people sitting directly in front of us were allowed to drink...guess they figure the types who will buy standing room are the types to get exceedingly drunk during the games...ah well, next time I'll just bring my flask.  after the game, went to the nudie bar, For Your Eyes Only to be exact...its a really nice place, all the women are good looking, little too classy for me though I think...one thing I don't particularly like though is you can't sit right up at the stage, there's perverts row (the row right up on the stage for the uninitiated) then the bar then the stage, kind of like to get right up front, but what can you do?  also, seems kind of reserved...I mean, no one really hoops or hollers or anything, only people clapping (or even paying attention to the stage for that matter) seem to be the guys in the first row (I was one of them!), also the beers are $7.00!  thinking about it now, maybe I don't like it there as much as I first thought, quite a few things that bother me about it...after that we went back to Pickering to the Palace (Pickering's nudie bar)...I really like the Palace, good atmosphere, everybody just seems to be there to have a good time, no stuffy guys in suits or anything, and the women for the most part are quite good looking, beers are a little cheaper too which is always nice...one thing I'd like to point out to strippers in general though, just because I'm not wearing a suit or sipping wine or rolling up in my benz doesn't mean I don't have any money for a lap dance...time after time they'd just walk by us, why?  because I was sitting in pervert's row? because I was in jeans and my leafs jersey?  seems silly to me...guess I can't really blame them though, they're just looking to make as much money as possible, so why waste their time with someone who looks like a bum?  maybe its just my nurosis coming through, but I refuse to go up and ask a stripper for a dance, I'll just wait for her to come to me...seems silly and probably results in more frustration than necessary, but that's just me (unfortunately)...if you haven't noticed, i love going to the nudie bars, pretty much always a guaranteed good time, I mean what better to go with a beer than naked chicks?  plus, since I'm such a fuck up, its the only way I'm going to see naked chicks anyways!  i actually started a website devoted to nudie bars in toronto... urlLink torontoadult.com ...there's nothing there right now, but i've basically got the site designed and programmed and everything, just need to update the information and away we go, maybe that'll be this weekends project...  just re-reading my post from yesterday and my prophecy came true, I feel like total shit today....not much of a surprise since I didn't go to bed until 3 and woke up at around 6:30...I dont get headaches with my hangover though, just get the gut rot...you know, the feeling that the beer floating around in your stomach is slowly eating its way through all your vital organs?  kind of have the feeling I get when I'm about to throw up, though I know I'm not...just that constant uneasy feeling sitting there, churning away....cant really complain though since i did it to myself and i'll turn around and do it all again tommorrow...

       Going to the hockey game tonight! (I know I mentioned that before, but just thought I'd repeat myself for those not paying attention)...tommorrow is going to be a rough one, probably get pissed up tonight, but that's the price we pay I guess.  No alcohol allowed in the standing room though, so guess we'll be chugging beers during intermission!  Next time I decide to buy Leafs tickets over the Internet though, I'll wait until game day...when I bought these all that was left was standing room, today when I looked out of curiousity there were platinums available...go figure...guess they release tickets they'd reserved for the visiting team, sponsors, etc...not that I'd pay $200 to go see the Phoenix Coyotes, but still.....gives me hope that I might actually be able to buy tickets to a game that include a seat!

       well, since my last post, the leafs have lost three in a row...not good, not good at all.  although I, unlike many Leafs fans, haven't completely given up on the season just because of this little skid...they'll get things turned around, hopefully tommorrow since I'll be at the game!  sucks though, the only seats I could get are standing room, obstructed view at that!  oh well, never been in these before, we'll see just how bad they are.  I really really need to get in shape...Monday I was out tossing the football around with a friend and within 5 minutes I was already having trouble breathing!  Plus, for some reason I bruise extremely easily, don't think that's necessarily a result of me not being in shape, its just kind of weird, from the football I have a big purple\blue bruise on the inside of my forearm...thats probably not a good thing

       The Leafs lost again last night, this time 4-1 to the fucking Florida Panthers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Jesus H. Christ this is getting ridiculous!  I'm not starting to panic or worry they're going to miss the playoffs or anything (yet) but c'mon guys, time to buckle up the chin strap and get to work!  after the game, me and two buddies drowned our sorrows (actually I think I was the only one who actually gave a shit, but I digress) until 3 in the morning, not a good idea (I say that a lot don't I?), naturally I feel like crap today, my stomach is making many strange noises and I have the most disgusting taste in my mouth (yes I did brush my teeth if that's what you were thinking)...oh well.  On a happier note the  urlLink Jackass movie  comes out tommorrow, can't wait...for some odd reason I really like see people do stupid stuff to themselves, maybe it makes me feel better about my own injury-proneness, i don't know, but its funny shit regardless...surprised no one in Canada has picked it up for tv here, the only Canadians who've seen it up to now are either people who got it off the internet or those with hacked US satellites...but they're advertising the hell out of the movie up here (even saw an ad on the boards during the hockey game yesterday which made me laugh...big yellow sign that said 'jackass' in bold black letters)...though I don't care that much if they show it since I've already seen them all  hehe, added a stat tracking thing to this site last week, checked the stats yesterday...99% of the visits have been from me!  not that this comes as a surprise, just found it funny...though that makes me wonder why the fuck i keep posting to this thing even though i know no one is looking at it...guess its serving as a kind of diary or whatever...

ARGH!  Was so exhausted I fell asleep almost as soon as I got home, which was at 7, slept for about 12 hours, now I feel like crap today...

       well, hasn't been too good for sports the past couple of days...first the leafs only manage a tie to the dirty filthy stinking Habs on saturday, then the dolphins somehow manage to lose to the Barfalo Biles (6 turnovers will usually do that, thanks Ray Lucas!), then the Leafs lost to boston tonight 4-1...kind of depressing...especially the dolphins, granted, their starting quarterback and top two receivers were out, but still, its buffalo and one of the worst defenses in the nfl...ahh well, what can you do...got an extra week off then they play green bay on monday night football, at least they'll have chris chambers back, and the newest dolphin, cris carter!  i have faith...  in other news, i've been drinking an awful lot lately...saturday night-got fucked, sunday-got relatively wasted (on a side note, why the fuck is the palace (pickering's only nudie bar for those not paying attention) not open on sunday?  what, does no one want to see some pussy on a sunday night?  we found out the hard way it was closed, but i digress), and now its monday, and i've got a nice buzz going (you're probably saying to yourself 'if he's drunk, how come there aren't all kinds of spelling errors or something?', well, smart ass, it takes me a hell of a long time to write this shit since i have to keep going back to correct myself)...could all my drinking have something to do with the fact that i'm always tired and feel like shit most of the time??? nah....must be something else!  now where the fuck is my beer?

I'll get to that another time...

       so its Halloween...woop-dee-fucking-doo...I've never liked it, even as a kid, don't know why, never was a big candy fiend or anything, and I guess my acute shyness made me feel a little uncomfortable going up to strangers and asking for candy...and now that I'm older I couldn't give two shits about Halloween, no costume parties for me (not that I was invited to any....) and really just view the whole thing as yet another corporate event designed to sell millions and millions of dollars worth of crap.  Me?  Bitter? nahhhhhhh....

       hehe, I've started another blog that no one will read...although this new one will actually have a purpose.  I'm planning on building a  urlLink MAME  cabinet.  What the fuck is MAME you ask?  Its an emulator for the computer so you can play all the old arcade classics like Pac Man and Galaga and Street Fighter.  Ok...so what the fuck is a MAME cabinet you ask?  Well, its basically a computer running MAME, built into an arcade cabinet and interfaced with real arcade controls so it actually feels like you're playing the real thing!  so yeah, anyways, you can visit the new part of the site  urlLink here .  fun fun fun

       what with the release of that new Nirvana single, 'You Know You're Right' and the new greatest hits package there's been a lot of talk about Nirvana on tv and the radio...MTV imparticular has been running a lot of specials, which seems kind of shameless to me, like its one gigantic advertising push...but I digress...back when Kurt Cobain died I never really thought too much about it, just kind of like 'oh, that's a shame' sort of thing...it wasn't until a few years later that it really struck me what a loss it was...I mean, Nirvana basically changed the way music was going...up until then the radio was entirely dominated by boy bands and cock rock...yeah there were other bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden and that, but 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' and Nevermind in general just picked rock up by the scruff of the neck and gave it a swift kick in the ass and opened the door...of course all the record companies then jumped all over the grunge bandwagon and steered it right off a cliff, but still, Nirvana really seemed to make it ok to rock, ok to have heavy guitars and a lo-fi sound...and there you go, that's my personal hommage to Nirvana...

        urlLink The Jackass Movie  was absolutely hilarious!  Can't remember one part that I didn't laugh at, even the more disturbing parts (and there definitely some disturbing things)...other than that it was a fairly uneventful weekend...Leafs lost again on Saturday, STILL not panicing, but they really need to get going soon, hopefully tonight against Anaheim.  yeah...that's about it...............................fuck my life sucks

       was a very painful weekend in more ways than one...Leafs lost to the garbage Habs 5-2 on Saturday, then on Sunday I somehow managed to royally fuck up my foot, how I don't know, now its purple and very painful...then last night the Dolphins lost to the Packers 24-10 (god does Ray Lucas ever suck)...but on the bright side I got quite drunk Saturday and Sunday and had fun...other than, you know, the whole, sports losing and crippling injuries...oh, and I somehow now have a hole in my wall which I have no idea how it happened...don't think my mom will be too impressed when she gets home!  I really really really need to buy a projector...watching the hockey game on it was awesome, but even cooler was watching football...when my buddy came back to get it, going back to regular TV was just painful...I mean the projector was like an 80" TV, mine is 32".....if only they weren't $3500 plus :(

       Rememberance Day...really don't understand why this isn't a national holiday, seems like almost an insult to all the veterans...I mean, there's labour day, civic holiday, thanksgiving, good friday but we can't even have a single fucking day to remember the veterans or the people still serving today?   seems a little fucked up to me...

       its been over a week since I posted to this thing...why?  well, partly because I know no one is actually reading the crap that I spew, and partly because I've actually been busy here at work, unbelievable!  anyways, what's new?  not a whole fuck of a lot, went to the Leafs game last night and saw them beat one of the best teams in the league, the Bruins, 2-0!  good shit!  also, the Dolphins finally won a game after losing three straight, hopefully a sign of things to come...maybe i'll write something more tonight, probably not though.................

       haha, another week between posts...oh well, now I'm back to doing nothing at work so maybe I'll get around to posting some more.  Why bother though?  Its Thanksgiving in the US, most Americans get two days off, which really really is unfair.  Our Thanksgiving is always on a Monday.  Why do we Canadians always get shafted with the holidays?  Although we do get Boxing day off, but still.......plus there's football on today which I won't be able to watch, and tommorrow the Leafs play at one in the afternoon which really eats ass, I'll have to listen to the game on the radio...grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  What else is new? hmmmmmm, not a whole fuck of a lot....heh, just realized I said the exact same thing in my last post.  another testament to just how godawfully boring my pathetic excuse for a life is.  are other people as bored as me?  I don't know...I imagine everyone else out there going out, doing stuff, enriching their lives, meanwhile I just sit in my basement, watch tv and occasionally get shitfaced.  Watched Cribs on MTV last night.  That show really really pisses me off, makes me so jealous to see these people have all kinds of crap (like plasma tv's in every room, a couple of cars, etc.) while I'll have none of it.  The worst is how most of them are so blase about it all, like all this expensive stuff just appeared in their house's and they don't really care all that much...sickening....as you can tell I'm a very bitter person.  All the Christmas hype is in full swing and it makes me nauseous.  I really don't get that excited over Christmas...I more look forward to the time off and the annual Christmas Day pissup than anything else, add to that that this year my family has decided that we should only buy a present for one person instead of buying one for each person, which seems pretty shitty to me...guess it will save me some money but still, the more presents the better!  lol, not only am I bitter but I'm self-absorbed and greedy too!

       I'm still feeling pretty shitty, seems everytime I eat something I get these really bad stomach pains.  They're almost bad enough to make me double over in pain...where are my tums?  Watched Spiderman last night...it was pretty good but some of the effects looked crappy, especially the ones early one where he's hopping from roof to roof, and they could have made that Kirsten Dunst wet t-shirt part last a little longer (would have freeze framed it but batteries were dead on my remote, and yes I am a pervert!).    Watched Mallrats too (satellite went down so I had nothing else to do)...great movie...'That kid is  back  on the escalator!'...'Would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?'  hee hee  Then finally I saw Slapshot (missed the first hour)...all my friends are always bugging me that I hadn't seen it, they'd always quote lines and tell me how great it was and everything...I still haven't seen the whole thing from the beginning but what I saw was good...'Hey Reg, I want a chair by the pool'  'I want some snatch by the pool!'  That was quite the movie watching marathon I had, which is odd.  I barely ever watch movies, don't ever rent them and rarely go to see them (last movie I went to the theatres for was Jackass, well worth it!)...probably because I don't have a girlfriend, I'd feel kind of weird renting a movie for myself, and unless its some real big movie event like Lord of the Rings, seems weird to go to a movie with a buddy....does that sound odd?  probably, so what?

       yet another week (well, 6 days if you want to be picky) between posts, but luckily there hasn't been too much an uproar from my loyal readers (which number 1, that 1 being me...)  surprisingly still nothing new...Leafs won a thriller in overtime last night, over .500 for the first time since the first game of the season which is good...fuck i need to get a life

       Christmas is under a week away and I couldn't really care less....only things I like about it is the time of and the pissup that usually happens Christmas Day...other than that I couldn't give a flying fuck.  Don't know why this is, I just find it hard to get excited for all the family bullshit that goes along with these occasions, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, all just very annoying to me...am I a spoil sport?  Probably...bad son? maybe.  so?

       Still feeling sick...really sucks...but on the bright side the Dolphins beat the Raiders last night and put themselves into first in the AFC!!!! Really, sports are the only thing I actually find myself getting excited about...there really isn't anything else going on in my life besides watching the Leafs and the Dolphins, other than that I just sit around, watch tv and sleep, pretty fucking boring but what can i do?

       First post of the New Year, first post in almost three weeks, does anyone really care?  No.......Christmas and New Year's were both pretty shitty.  The Dolphins blew it and are now out of the playoffs which makes it very difficult to watch football now.  Going to Montreal next week to see the Leafs destroy the pathetic Habs which is always fun.    Went to the nudie bar Saturday night, the Palace in Pickering.  God do I ever love the nudie bar, its just so much fun.  Its impossible to be in a bad mood there, I mean how can you not love watching hot, naked women gyrate for you while you just leer at them, not having to worry about looking like a pervert, since everyone else there is doing the same!  The Palace had been going downhill, not too many dancers, some ugly ones etc, but if Saturday night is any indication, its on the rise!

       god damn its cold outside, something like -30 with the wind chill...Super Bowl this weekend, I don't really care all that much but it should still be a pretty good game, not really doing anything special though (I don't think), can't be bothered cramming myself into a bar and paying out the ass for beer, rather just stay home with a couple buddies and watch the game, get drunk...good times...hope the Raiders win because I can't stomach the thought that Rob Johnson might actually be on a championship team and get a ring, he doesn't even deserve to be in the NFL, never mind in the Super Bowl (true he won't be playing barring some horrific injury, but its the principle of the matter)

       another 2 weeks between posts.....so?  what's new?  got Norwalk last week...puking and shitting non-stop for 4 straight days, fan-fucking-tastic...had tickets to a Leafs game which I couldn't use because of it...at least I got well in time to go to Montreal to see the Leafs beat the Habs which is always fun...its become a tradition, this was the third straight year we've gone...besides the game, we didn't do much besides get absolutely shit faced and go to the nudie bars (see a theme developing here?)...the strip clubs in Montreal are different than here though...not really sure how to explain it, they just are...

       I really don't understand why they have to have the 'money shot' in pornos...I really don't see the attraction, cum all over her face, why?...just an observation.  Also, why the hell do they always cut to shots of the guy in the middle of the action?  Who the fuck cares about him???  Keep the camera on the woman, that's what everybody's tuning in to see...but the absolute worst (which I saw last night, and yes I do watch a lot of porn, remember, I am a gigantic loser) is when you're watching a few girls playing with each other and then...cut to same naked guy jerking off!  Jesus that's a turn-off......anyways, god bless directv and the spice channel!

       wow, almost a month since I last posted to this thing...did anybody notice?  lets see whats new...fixed my computer, it was the crappy case I bought, was too small to allow airflow and everything was overheating....bought tickets to go see Metallica and the Deftones (there are other bands but I don't really give two shits about them), show isn't until July but I'm already excited...was so happy that Doug Gilmour was coming back to the Leafs and what happens?  first game back he fucks his knee, fannnnnn-tastic!  why do I even bother with this...why do I even have my own website, nobody cares, obviously i don't care either...i have also come to the conclusion that I am a compulsive liar.  I can lie to anyone about anything without thinking twice.  My mother, friends, whatever, doesn't matter, I've lied to them all.  Surprisingly it doesn't really weigh on my conscience or anything either.  I'm not saying I'm proud of this or anything, just stating it as fact.  Well, maybe saying I'm a compulsive liar is a little extreme.  But I lie about a lot of things and rarely get caught, odd.

       well, the war has begun and I'm glad...bomb the fuck out of them, kill Saddam Hussein, this guy has been causing trouble for long enough, its time for him to go...and what the hell are all these protestors moaning and groaning about?  I don't recall them holding a rally for all the kurds he gassed?  nahhh, who cares about them right?  or never mind the fact that this is one serious nutjob who even UN inspectors admit has anthrax, mustard gas and VX nerve gas...but why worry about him?  never mind that even with all these sanctions he's still able to funnel money to support terrorism, still able to meet with al qaeda operatives...fuck him...he can't die soon enough...  One more thing, all these musicians and actors who are coming out and speaking against the war or making clever little anti-war songs should all just shut the fuck up...just because you have enough fame to afford you a soap box, doesn't mean you should go around and feel you can yak about whatever is rattling around in that empty head of yours...you want to do something?  go hold a benefit concert in baghdad if you're so damned concerned.

       The war rolls on, everyone in the media seems to be going ape shit that fighting is tougher than expected, etc...but what did they think?  The US is invading their country!  You'd expect them to put up at least some sort of fight.  I get the BBC on satellite and they really piss me off...seems in their overwhelming desire to appear to be impartial, they come off as more anti-war, which maybe they are, but their country IS one of the main combatants, so you think you'd have some interest in keeping morale up...also so a report that hackers had fucked al-jazeera's website up which i found quite funny...the arabic version got redirected to a porn site while the english went to an american flag or something...serves the fuckers right...there isn't anything fair and balanced about what they're doing...they're obviously pro-arab, pro-iraq and know that many of their viewers delight in seeing westerners suffer, just fanning the flames of anti-western hatred.

       feel like crap today...up drinking until 2:30, woke up at 6:30...oh well  War rages on...can't believe how many protests there were over the weekend...maybe its just me, but people today, the majority it seems, have been turned into gigantic pussies...something goes wrong, something goes the way its not supposed to and its the end of the world...everybody pissing and moaning for peace, give sanctions more time etc...why doesn't society have any balls any more?  at least George W has a set...seems the US, in the interest of saving as many civilians as possible, is causing them casualties...jesus, if they weren't so worried about the civilians, they would have just flattened half these cities and then roll in and mop up...like in the first Gulf War, they'd bombed Iraq for about 4 weeks before the ground war finally started, this time the army and marines went in the first or second day...you would think they could just issue warnings like "citizens of (INSERT CITY NAME HERE), you have 48 hours to flee the city...after which time we can not be held responsible for any civilian casualties"...only problem with that I guess is that there are stories that the Iraqi army is forcing people to stay in their homes and not letting them flee...who knows...anyways, death to Saddam!

       i've been feeling fairly sick all week...dry, hacking cough mostly, runny nose...don't think its SARS though...but you never know...this whole thing with SARS is a little freaky, kind of like Outbreak...this thing seems to have sprung out of nowhere and no one really knows all that much about it...  war still rages on...i'm not watching all the coverage as much anymore, was bordering on addiction for a while there I think...plus, for the most part, they just replay the same interviews, news items, etc. over and over and over again all day...I think there's probably an hour's worth of original programming a day, spread out over 24 hours...welcome to the world of competing 24-hour news networks!  while I was watching MSNBC, they had someone on the phone who said he was at the Saddam Airport, they asked him if there were people trying to storm the gates and he said "No, mostly they're coming up and begging for copies of the Howard Stern show"...the guy (Chris Matthews I think) was flabbergasted for a minute there, and then they quickly cut over to someone else...I'd heard prank calls talked about on the show before, but this was the first one I'd ever heard while it was going on...funny stuff!

       went out last night for what I thought was just going to be wings and a beer, next thing I know its almost 1am and I'm on my way home from the rippers...this time we went to the House of Lancaster in Etobicoke...really good place...lots of dancers for a Tuesday night, plus a feature (Kira Kenner, the first feature I've ever seen that I'd actually heard of...her show wasn't great but still...)  Everything would have been great were it not for one stripper who refused to take no for an answer...over and over I'd tell her I didn't want a dance, although I don't actually say no, I say 'not right now' which you would think would convey the message...but no, she'd go away for a bit and then come back to harass me some more...by the time we left she was really starting to piss me off (might not have been as aggravating if she'd been a little hotter...)  Leafs open up the playoffs against the Flyers tonight...I can feel it, this is our year, Lord Stanley is coming home!  The Flyers will be tough, but if the Leafs can get by them, I see no reason why the can't at least make it to the finals (although I figured they'd have no problem with Carolina either, and look what happened with them last year)...

       pretty boring weekend...pissed it up Friday as usual...I find I'm falling asleep a lot more when I go drinking than I used to, not sure why...maybe I'm drinking more?  sleeping less?  whatever...didn't do anything saturday since I had to get up a 4 in the morning to drive my mom and sister to the airport...small price to pay for a week with the house to myself (not that I'll do much, but still)...hopefully I don't knock a hole in the wall like last time!  its supposed to snow between 5 and 15cm tonight...that is absolutely ridiculous...its April for fuck sakes!  our driveway is still encased in ice, no way in hell am i going to give myself a heart attack trying to shovel that shit...it has to melt sooner or later!  as long as I can get up the driveway and into the garage, I couldn't care less...

       I'm always managing to injure myself somehow when I get drunk...there was the time I fucked my knee while dancing at my friend's wedding, the time I was running accross the street, tripped over the curb and messed up my ankle, or the time I fell into my friend's stone fireplace shoulder first...the latest injury?  Was out drinking in the forest near my house the other night with friends, went to take a leak, walking back I walked right into a tree stump!  Since it was so dark I couldn't really see how bad it was, but once we got into the light, found blood all over my socks, on my jeans, not pretty...here,  urlLink take a look for yourself  (the pic is from two days later, still hurts like hell though)...I'm sure there's a message to be found somewhere in all these drunken injuries, but damned if I know what it is!

       My leg is pretty much better now, doesn't hurt too much, still doesn't look too good though...the other night they had Icon:Metallica on MTV...basically a tribute to Metallica with other bands doing their songs, then they perform at the end...started out with Sum 41 who did pretty well, their guitarist had no trouble with any of the solos...two of the guys from Staind did an acoustic version of Nothing Else Matters that I liked, gave me chills sort of...they had Snoop Dogg doing Sad But True for some reason, it was really brutal.  He didn't really try and arrange it or anything, he just kind of spoke the words over the guitar...Avril Lavigne did Fuel which was ok, nothing really special, and she really needs to get some stage presence, she just basically stood there with a blank stare on her face...Limp Bizkit, who I don't particularly like, did a pretty good version of Sanitarium, lots of energy...Korn did One, which was pretty good, except for the fucking bass player, way too overpowering, plus they didn't do the kickass solo, maybe they didn't have time for a 7 minute song?  Or maybe they just can't play it...Then there was Metallica, and boy oh boy did they sound good.  They did a medley of some killer songs like Hit the Lights, Blackened, etc.  Then as the show was ending they played their new song, Frantic.   Of course MTV ended the show before they could play the whole song, but it sounded promising...heavier than most of the Load and Re-Load crap, but won't really know until I can hear the whole song.

       why the fuck do i bother with this stupid thing????????????????  its not like i even read it myself so I can't even claim its like therapy or anything...and its not like I even have some throughly exciting life that people would actually be interested in hearing about...basically all I do is go to work, go home, drink myself stupid, repeat...this weekend went to a friends cottage, started drinking at noon, had a nap around 7 for about two hours, and then started drinking again until 7am...probably not too healthy but then again, what difference does it make?  shoot me someone please

       its amazing how easily i can be talked into drinking...a friend comes over last night at 9, start out just watching the hockey game...halfway through the 2nd period he says 'you want to head over to the bull and finch (a bar just around the corner) for a beer or two?'...well, seeing as i didn't have any beers and my liquor supplies are getting dangerously low, i said sure.  now this wasn't supposed to be a late night since both of us had to be at work for 8 today...next thing i know its 2am and we're the last ones in the bar!  i don't really think i have a drinking problem...i just have a problem saying no!  if i ever start drinking alone i'll be worried, but just going out and getting shitfaced every now and then is a-ok in my books  didn't get around to buying the new metallica album yesterday, will probably go and get it sometime this weekend...from what i'm hearing though it sounds like its the kind of thing you either love or hate, no middle ground...

       new Metallica album comes out today...pretty much every review I've read has been positive, like they've gone back to their thrashier roots but I will judge for myself when I buy it today...I heard the first single and I'm not too sure though, although apparently the version on the cd is 2 minutes longer than the one on the radio...either way I can't wait for July 5th when I go see SUMMER SANITARIUM!!!!  METALLICA!!!  Deftones are on the bill as well as Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park and Mudvayne...really excited to see Metallica and the Deftones, the other bands I don't really care about...  Speaking of the Deftones, they were interviewed in some magazine and were talking shit about how they don't think they should be opening for LP and LB since the Deftones really were pioneers of the genre, and how the Deftones live show would blow Metallica's out of the water...now, you can talk all the shit you want about Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park, but its Metallica's tour, they're taking you on the biggest tour you've ever been on and you're going to start talking about them?  ever hear of not biting the hand that feeds you?  ahh well

       heard on the news that some teacher's assistant at my old high school,  urlLink Upper Canada College , was busted on child porn charges...apparently this perv had a large stash on 2 computers at his house and on one at the school...doesn't really come as a surprise though, there's been charges of sex abuse going on there for a while...not to say that this guy had done anything, but its worrysome enough to know that a perv like him was even at the school...true this could have happened anywhere, but UCC just seems to attract it, and I'm sure there's more going on than they admit publicly, trying to preserve their public image and so on

       so the Devils won the cup...meh...didn't really care one way or the other, although in a way the Ducks winning would have been the capper to an unbelievable run, but then Disney probably wanted to turn it into a movie or something...lol,,,pretty classy of the devils fans to boo Giguere when he won the Conn Smythe, christ people, your team just won the cup, enjoy it, don't be worrying about him...and really I think it was a good decision, sure he wasn't at his best in the finals, but for the first 3 rounds he was unbeatable, he pretty much single-handedly won every series...  on another note, was out drinking again last night, although this was an early one, was in bed by 1!  don't know what it is, i really just don't have too much ambition at the moment...right now i'm just enjoying being fat, lazy and drunk...although i'm almost 25 and its probably about time i start growing up, maybe tommorrow........or maybe not

       got the new Metallica Saturday...its different that's for sure...still haven't completely made up my mind if I like it or not, definitely not better than master of puppets or and justice for all...its heavy but i'm not sure in a good way, the drums sound kind of funny, the songs seem kind of disjointed and james' vocals don't seem to have the same kind of growl or emotion they used to...but i'll give it a few more listens before I judge

       over at the Leafs  urlLink message board  I frequent, there came about a discussion on the worst tv shows ever...there have been some real stinkers mentioned, like:   ROCKET ROBIN HOOD    God was this show ever bad...some of the worst animation I've ever seen, the stories were so ridiculous, and they just repeated the same little bits over and over again...more info can be found at  urlLink this site    CHARLES IN CHARGE  Scott Baio...enough said.  ick   THE MIKE BULLARD SHOW  The worst talk show I have ever seen, yes, even worse than Pat Sajak's pathetic attempt...so totally unfunny...his bits suck, his interviews suck, crappy guests, his band sucks...in short the whole show blows goats.  However, the worst show ever, IMHO is:  SMALL WONDER  about some scientist who secretly builds a robotic maid, only in the form of a little girl, who brings it home to live with his family...hilarity is supposed to ensue, but it doesn't...the girl who played the robot, V.I.C.I (like vicki, clever eh?) was a terrible actor, did some horrible 'robot' voice and was just generally annoying...and then there was the son of the family who was possibly even more annyoying...something very gay about that kid...i shudder even thinking about that pile of shit show

       got tickets for the stones show today, should be kick ass!  they keep alleging they're going to add more bands but I'm not sure if that means more big name bands or filler shit like sass jordan or that french group that is on the bill....ahh well, who the fuck cares, stones, ac/dc and the guess who!  not much planned for this weekend, i'm sure i'll be intoxicated at some point though...lately i've been thinking alot more about the direction (or lack thereof) that my life is heading, and its not a very rosy picture...I'm going to be 25 in just over 2 weeks and I have no job prospects, a social life that consists of me getting drunk every now and then and not much else, no romantic prospects, nothing............................and for all the pondering over everything I do, I still have no idea what I'd do to turn things around...don't know how I could go back to school since I already have so much debt that I need to keep working...and I'm so fucked in the head when it comes to dealing with other people I don't know if my social life will ever improve....guess I'm just doomed to a life of solitude and misery...yay

       wow...went to a buddy's girlfriend's cottage on the weekend and was it ever good!  very intoxicated, we polished off a whole keg, weather was awesome, just good times....  they announced another concert for SARS relief this morning (the first was this past weekend, couldn't go since I was up at the cottage)...this next one is July 30th, with the Stones, AC/DC, the Guess Who and....Justin Timberlake??? wtf?  doesn't really fit the mold...I mean you have three of the world's greatest rock bands, living legends, and then you have a backstreet boy???  plus, the show is on a Wednesday?  plus, what started out as a free show is now going to cost $21.50?  still, I'll probably go...minus the backstreet boy its a pretty kick ass lineup, when are you ever going to get to see the Rolling Stones for $20?  also, now I hear Sam Roberts will be there too which is good...now just have to find someone else who wants to go

       just have to say, I love going to the nudie bar...monday night went to the brass rail here in Toronto and god damn was it ever fun...got a lap dance from this drop-dead gorgeous blonde whose name I can't really remember (Trish or Tricia or something like that)...I'd say she was about a 9 out of 10, perfect tits, tight ass, beautiful smile, eyes you could get lost in....spent a good while talking to her, said she modeled in Japan, lived in LA and Vegas...could have been completely bullshitting me, but really, who cares?  Its weird how I can actually have a discussion and be somewhat charming with strippers, but if it was just a regular girl at a bar I'd clam right up...could have something to do with the fact that I'm always inebriated when I go to the rippers, but still.......and its not like I have any grand illusions that I'm going to woo them off their feet and have them fall madly in love with me or anything...and yes, I know they're just trying to suck all the money out of my wallet, but still, its nice having hot women fawning over you for a change............and yes, I do realize I'm extremely pathetic  Metallica in 2 days!  Can't fucking wait, even though I'm pretty sure I'm going to die from heat stroke before they even hit the stage!  Supposed to be 31 on Saturday (not including the humidity)...if the roof of the skydome is open and the sun is blazing all day, its going to be insanely hot...won't really be able to drink to much, don't really want to either, I'd actually like to be able to remember what goes on...a novel idea, I know

Christ, you can get 0% at any of the domestic dealers...not too tough a decision there...yes, I do like my car but I've been jonesing for a truck for a while now, time seems right to strike

       I'm a little less sore today.  Instead of a sharp pain whenever I move my neck, there's just a constant, dull pain...which is an improvement I suppose.  I should really go see a doctor though I think.  Where I ran into the tree stump and mangled my leg is still all discoloured, two months later...now with my neck and back and knees, plus I have this mystery sore throat that came out of nowhere, I'm seriously in rough shape...I always hesitate going to see a doctor though because I know they're just going to tell me I need to cut down on my drinking, eat healthier, excercise and all that shit...scary thing is I know all these things but don't really care all that much...I'm probably setting myself up for a whole host of health problems in the not to off future...c'est la vie!

       went to see Metallica et al Saturday and I am sooooo sore today, 2 days later!  mostly my neck, too much headbanging...my knees are fucked too, standing for 8 hours straight will do that to you...Metallica, as expected, was awesome, even though it took an hour and a half for them to come on stage (sound problems or something)...limp bizkit was surprisingly good, really got the crowd going...didn't see much of linkin park since I was stuck in a massive mob just trying to get a beer, must have waited about half an hour, and then when I got it, couldn't take it into the stands or down to the floor, what the fuck?  deftones were pretty good, sometimes was hard to hear though, sound got a little muddled...didn't see mudvayne and don't really care...all in all, a great time

       The Miami Dolphins open training camp today...football season is just around the corner and I couldn't be happier...I love hockey and all but the season is sooooo long, its kind of like a march toward the playoffs.  Football, on the other hand, every game is life or death.  There's just something that feels more important, more impressive about the NFL than any other sport.  So far this year I'm planning on going to two football games...with a friend (Bucs fan) to see Tampa Bay @ New Orleans and then to Buffalo for the Dolphins\Bills game...a live football game is unlike anything else I've ever witnessed...just the number of people and the energy is overwhelming...can't wait.  Went out for lunch with a buddy and ended up taking an extra half an hour than I should, plus drinking about 3/4 of a pitcher, which probably wasn't a good idea seeing as how I had to come back to work and all...............then again, its not like I even do anything anyways, so who's going to notice? HA!

       Its been over two weeks since I first started feeling sick and I'm still not really feeling all that much better...maybe I should try taking some medicine or something?  nahhhhh  Got rid of my car last night...kind of sad, but I sure as hell won't miss the $420 a month I wasy paying for it.  Now I'm driving what was my sister's Acura 1.7EL, and she's driving a new Blazer...sweet deal for me, and the 1.7 isn't really a bad car...got some balls to it.  Next Wednesday is the big Stones show and I still have no idea how we're getting there, how we're getting back or anything...the only thing I'm sure of is it's going to be one gigantic mess...doubt I'll be home until the sun's coming up...originally the plan was to rent a bus but we're all so fucking disorganized that that's not going to happen...probably end up taking the subway up there and trying to find a cab back...the best thing to do would probably just take a seat once the show's over and wait for everyone to file out, then start making our way home...avoid some of the crush of people...ahh well, should be fun regardless.

       Went to a buddies' cottage this weekend, was a pretty good time...I'm covered head to toe in mosquito bites though (at least I think they're bites, not poison ivy), hopefully I don't have west nile now.  Drank a hell of alot of beer...second night I was there I passed out at 11...apparently they were trying everything to wake me up and I was just totally unconscious...good times!  Going on vacation next week, going to Vegas and then to San Diego to visit my uncle...should be fun, going with my family though so that might put a bit of a damper on things, but still, I think its impossible to not have a good time in Vegas...wonder if I'll be able to slip away to a nudie bar there, although going by myself is pretty pathetic, even for me!  My cousin said he might come over from Sacramento which would be very cool...

       Today is the day of the big Stones show...should be pretty nuts...I can already forsee problems meeting up with my friends.  They're driving there and I'm supposed to meet up with them at a subway station...however in a sea of thousands and thousands of people, that could be a little tricky.  Of course he has my ticket so if I can't find them I'm fucked!  Getting home though, will be way worse than getting up there...450,000 people all filing out at the same time is a recipe for disaster...who knows, maybe we'll end up sleeping in the car?

       Had a pretty fun night last night.  Started out with a beer on the patio at Hooters, which was alright (bloody expensive though).    After that, we made our way to The House of Lancaster which was pretty crap.  Granted, it was only around 6:30 but even still.  It was pretty empty and there weren't that many girls milling about.  There was one though that kept sitting at our table, even though we weren't making any effort to talk to her or anything, she just sat there.  Was cute though...huge tits, but her face was kind of off...don't know how to describe it.    From there, we headed up to Whiskey-a-Go-Go, my favourite strip club in the GTA.  It was pretty busy, lots of girls, and all of them around a 7 or better.  At one point, there were 2 girls on stage who claimed to be sisters, though I doubt that a bit...it was hot though.  Then a little later on, one of the waitresses hopped up on stage with one of the strippers, and they were then joined by one of the shooter girls...good times.  Plus, I saw possibly the hottest stripper I've ever seen - came out in a leather bustier sort of thing, her big fake tits practically popping out...she was absoultely gorgeous.  Don't remember her name, and didn't see her after that, but wow.  The beauty of Go-Go's is, if you sit down in the area around the stage which is sort of a pit, you won't get harassed for dances as the girls stay up to the top (although last night I wouldn't have minded being harassed).  It had actually been quite awhile since I'd been to the nudie bar.  I don't really like going to the Palace (the strip club near me in Pickering) anymore since its always the same 5 or 6 girls there, and they are all so-so (except for one who's smoking hot, but you can't ever get a dance from her since as soon as she gets off stage she's off with some regular or something).  Plus, the beer is expensive.  True, beer is always expensive at the 'rippers, but at least at Go-Go's or the Brass Rail you get some quality girls to look at while you're drinking your $7 beer.  So, with the Palace cut out, I basically either have to go downtown or out to Mississauga and farther, which is hard to do and drink at the same time.  Why can't the Palace close, and be sold, and then re-open as Whiskey-a-Go-Go East or something?  God, I'd be there every day.

       I went to see Kill Bill vol. 2 the other day (ya, I really keep up on the new releases) and have to say that, on the whole, I was pretty disappointed.  Way less action, slow moving, and the ending was so cliched.  Vol. 1 was much better, not just because of the action, but because of the pacing too.  Vol. 2 just lurched along.  Being single I don't really go to see many movies (I refuse to go by myself, just like I refuse to drink by myself, no matter how tempting it may be), I only see the big 'event' type movies like Lord of the Rings and such.  Also, I never ever go and rent movies, again, because I'm a single loser...so I miss a lot of films.  I still haven't seen the third matrix for christs sakes.  Although even when my satellite was working (which it isn't anymore, thanks alot you stupid DirecTV fuckers!) I still never really watched movies.  Dunno why...

       Alright, everything seems to be working fine now, so I guess I'll fill in some of the blanks between last July and now.  - I did go to New Orleans.  Had a great time, except the Bucs fan I went with who was going to go to the football game with me was sick the entire time and just stayed in the hotel room.  Luckily, two other friends came down with us too.  One cautionary note: if you go to Pat O'Briens for the Hurricane (something like 5 different shots of rum, but tastes like fruit punch), don't drink 4 of them.  I did, seemed to be fine for a while, then boom!  Next thing I know I can barely walk, am babbling and get kicked out of a bar (and apparently, narrowly escape being arrested).  Back in the hotel room I then passed out, puked up some red crap, and then started yelling at my friend who was cleaning it up.  All this is what I've been told anyways, I don't remember anything past drinking the Hurricanes.  In general, New Orleans is a pretty dirty place.  Though I did enjoy the cheap beer.  Nice place to visit once but I doubt I'd go back  - went to see the Dolphins play the Bills in Buffalo.  Had a great time, tailgating was awesome, the game was good since Miami won, plus the fans weren't as bad as I'd been lead to believe (though it may have had something to do with the fact that the game was meaningless since Buffalo had already missed the playoffs).  Only thing that sucked was that US Customs seized our hamburgers because apparently there was some sort of beef ban...at least we still had sausages  - went to my first ever Leafs playoff game, game 1 against Ottawa...of course the Leafs lost that game, but I still had a hell of a time...was very drunk, very loud.  Sucks the Leafs lost to the Flyers, really thought they were going to pull it out, especially in game 6 when they came back to tie it...ahh well, shit happens  Other than that, nothing has really changed for me.  I'm still single of course, still live at home, still working for the family business with no prospects for any changes...just keep rolling along.

       Boy oh boy do I ever feel like crap today...had a few beers and then got into the rum and cokes last night.  Baaaaaad idea.  Especially when I had one with dark rum (ran out of white rum), that shit is nasty.  I can still taste it.  I really should just stick to beer, booze just brings a world of problems.  Going to the cottage tonight, can't wait.  Only problem is I'm driving.  Only got 4 hours sleep last night, so I'll be wiped by the time I get there.  Hopefully the fresh air will give me a kick in the ass.

       I don't know why, but I've been feeling very lonely lately, romantically I mean.  True, its nothing new since I'm a 25 year old loser without even a simple kiss on my romantic resume, but for whatever reason, recently the pangs have become more acute.    I went back on Lavalife, which I hadn't used in at least a year.  Maybe its because I'm too chicken to initiate anything, but I've never exchanged more than one e-mail with anyone through there.  In the 'intimate encounters' section, I came across a profile from a woman who said she was an 'inexperienced virigin looking for a teacher'.  I e-mailed her, saying I'm inexperienced too, maybe we could teach other, you know, trying to be all sensitive and stuff.  No e-mail back yet and its been a week...even virgins with a 'few extra pounds' (ie, fat, just like me) reject me.  I've also been giving more thought to going to a rub and tug or getting an escort or something.  I think to myself, maybe if I just got the actual act out of the way I would get some sort of self-confidence (although in the back of my mind I strongly doubt it).  Then I start thinking, how good could it really be if I'm paying some chick at a massage parlour $80 for a hand job?  After, maybe I'd feel empty.  Or if I got an escort (I could never pick up a hooker off the street, too paranoid), if it was just a wham-bam-thank you ma'am sort of thing, I don't believe I'd feel satisfied.  Either that, or I'd become so infatuated with the woman, I'd blow all my life savings on seeing her.  Plus, I wonder if it would be kind of weird to tell an escort that she's my first, maybe that would weird her out?  I guess I'm probably more interested in a relationship than just a quick lay.  Ahh well, guess I'll have to be satisfied with computer porn and my right hand.

       Absolutely beautiful outside.  So why am I inside?  May 2-4 this weekend, and for the first time I can remember I'm actually going to be going somewhere for it.  Going up to a buddy's cottage, way up in the boonies.  Should be a great time, lots of beers will be drank.  Only problem is we're smack dab in the middle of black fly season, and those little fuckers are annoying.  They're more annoying than mosquitos, plus they're smaller so they're impossible to kill.  Ahh well, will just have to stay inside and drink I guess.  Just over 2 days to go!

       Looks like a fairly boring weekend ahead.  No big deal I guess.  My mom and sister are going away so I'll have the house to myself which is nice.  Not like it means I'll be having some big shin-dig, probably just means more masturbation.  A thought came to me the other day: what would the repurcussions be if someone I knew actually read this thing?  I mean, here I am talking about going to see a hooker and going to nudie bars and this and that.  God almighty, if my mom ever read this she'd drop dead.  I mean, I assume its anonymous, but then again, there's my picture up at the top.  Ahh well, I'll cross that bridge if I ever come to it.

       Long weekend was pretty good...rained most of the time though, and the black flies were absolutely brutal.  But, we just stayed inside for the most part, drank beer and played cards (played poker until 7am one day, I lost of course).  I really really really wish my family had a cottage.  Would be kick ass.  Although the one major benefit of always going to other people's is you get to enjoy the fun times without having to put in the hours and hours of backbreaking work to maintain it.

       Fucking auction sniping at eBay.  I had bid on a coin door for my MAME cabinet, not even sure if it worked or not, but it would have made the cabinet look cooler, plus with bidding starting at $1 (compared to $120 brand new), how could I complain?  Anyways, the bidding had gotten up to $25.50, I had the high bid.  Refreshed with 12 seconds left and I'm still high bidder.  Refresh around 30 seconds later and BAM, I'd lost.  Guess now either the cabinet won't have a door, or I'll have to be on the lookout for another one.  *******  My ear hurts.  Not actually my ear, but the little knubby thing of my ear, what the hell is that called?  Its really sore for some reason.  Ahh well.

       Went out and bought the TV for my MAME cabinet yesterday.  A 24" Apex for $200 incl tax.  Just your basic tv...doesn't need a flat screen or fancy features, since it'll just be used for playing old arcade games.  Also, the keyboard encoder (the things that translate the button presses into keystrokes the computer can recognize) and trackball encoder (makes the computer think a trackball is just a normal mouse) shipped from England yesterday.  All the buttons and joysticks should ship in the next day or two from the US.  Once all that arrives, just need to buy the wood and get cutting!  I can't believe how excited I am about all this.  I'm sure once its actually built, after a while the novelty will fade, but fuck it will be cool.  Plus, my nephew loves playing all the old games on my computer, so it'll be fun for him to play them with the real joysticks and buttons.

       I had the weirdest dream last night.  I was at work, in the office, and nobody else was around.  Then all of a sudden these two smoking hot women come in and ask if they can have sex in one of the offices.  I say sure, as long as I can take pictures.  They start going to town on each other and I'm snapping away.  Then some other woman comes in, and I don't think I talk to her, but she starts giving me a blow job...and thats all I remember.  Bizarre.  Nice, but bizarre.

If you go through my archives (way back to October 30th, 2002 actually -  urlLink link ) you'll find me talking about starting building a  urlLink MAME  cabinet.  Well, like so many other of my plans that never took off....UNTIL NOW!  Yup, all the controls have been ordered, TV will be bought in the next few days, computer will be assembled shortly.  Fucking awesome!  Totally a geek thing to do but who cares?  Playing all the classics on real arcade controls in the comfort of my own home.  Ms Pac Man, QBert, Rampart, Donkey Kong...last count, I had over 3000 games.  Of course, a whole lot of those are whacked out Japanese porno Mahjong games, and a bunch more are just clones and bootlegs, but still.  Plus, you can throw a Nintendo emulator on there, Sega emulator, Commodore emulator.  And, I found out last night that Tiger Woods 2004 (the best golf game) for the PC can be played with a trackball.  My cabinet will have a trackball!  Will be just like playing GoldenTee at home.  Can't wait.

       Wow, 3 posts in a day...I really am bored.  But, since I heard on the radio that today is John Bonham's (if you don't know who he was, hang your head in shame) birthday, I had to say a few words about the greatest band ever, Led Zeppelin.  I accept no arguments on this subject.  Zeppelin was, is and will forever be the greatest rock band ever.  I listen to Zeppelin every day, be it on the radio or listening to the albums and it never gets old.  God, they're playing Moby Dick on the radio right now...soooo good.  I really think I should have been born in the 60's or late 50's, because that's really where all the music I like comes from.  I can't stand music from today (a few exceptions, very few).  Its too prepackaged, manufactured.  You listen to Zeppelin or the Stones or The Who and everything just has feeling and heart and flows.  Today, its just about making a hit single and then filling in the rest of the album.  What I wouldn't give to go back to the 70's to see Zeppelin live.  If haven't seen the Zeppelin DVD's that were released last year, do yourself a favour and pick them up.  Blew my mind.

       So there's an election coming up.  I'm voting Liberal.  I know everyone's crowing about the sponsorship scandal etc. but I'd take Paul Martin and the Liberals over the Reform...err Alliance...err Conservatives.    Even though the Tories are trying to soften their image, trying to look more middle leaning, I know deep down they're totally right-wing.  If they get elected, might as well say goodbye to any debate on gay marriage or loosening laws on pot (not that either matter to me, but its the principle).  Plus, that Harper guy is creepy, kind of robotic.  As for the NDP, while I sort of agree with their platform in principle, they're so far to the left that they'd just spend the country into a deep deep hole which would fuck things up for years to come.  No thanks.  I guess its sort of a case of going for the lesser of three evils.  Really, is the country in that bad shape after all these years of the Liberals?  No.

       Weekend was pretty shitty...Friday I did nothing, Saturday just watched the hockey game and had a few beers, then passed out.  Last night, had another couple beers and went to bed early.  All around crap.  I did watch Saving Private Ryan again though (guess the upcoming anniversary of D-Day got me thinking about it) and goddamn is that a great movie.  And yes, even though I had seen it a few times before, I still got a little choked up at the end.  Flames play again tonight.  Don't really know if I want them to win or not.  I don't buy into this whole 'they're doing it for Canada' or 'it'll be nice to bring the cup back to Canada' crap.  The Olympics were for Canada, the World Cup will be for Canada.  The Stanley Cup would be for Calgary.  Maybe its just me being a bitter Leafs fan.  But really, how would Calgary winning mean anything to anybody other than a Flames fan?  I didn't cheer for the Habs in 93, didn't cheer for Vancouver against the Rangers and I'm not going to cheer for the Flames now.  I cheer for the Leafs.  That's it.  So, go Flames, go Tampa, I couldn't care less who wins (though I still think Tampa will win).

       The wood for the MAME cabinet has been sanded and primed.  Couldn't get a coat of paint on it though, so that will probably have to wait for Sunday when I get back from the cottage.  Today is definitely going to be a long day...

       A bike courier just got hit by a car outside my work...I didn't see it happen, but I did hear all the screaming and shouting going on.  The guy doesn't look like he's hurt.  From what I could make out, one car cut the bike guy off, he swerved and then got hit by another car.  His bike is all twisted and bent.  I've just got to say, I hate those god damn couriers.  THey think they own the road, they weave in and out of traffic, cut you off, don't obey signals, almost run over pedestrians.  I'm not saying this guy deserved to get hit, but I'd wager that he isn't completely innocent.  I really ought to start carrying my camera with me everywhere so I can take pictures of crazy crap that happens, or just anything that strikes my fancy.  Guess I could get one of those camera-phones, but the price to transfer the data from the phone to e-mail or whatever is ridiculous, and the pictures are crappy too.

       Surprisingly, I don't feel all that bad this morning despite the fact that I had 9 beers last night in about 3 hours and didn't go to bed until around 3:30.  All the wood for the MAME cabinet is cut!  Tonight, I sand and prime it all.  Maybe get a coat of paint on it too if I have time.  Just looking at the wood all cut, I can start to see the finished cabinet.  I've got to come with a name for it now.  Don't really have any good ideas though...Beercade?  MolsonMame?  I've got nothing.  I've discovered I really like building stuff, doing projects and the like.  There was the shed\playhouse I built, now this.  Next I'm going to set up a workbench in the garage.  I've started amassing a tool collection (I've got a mitre saw, jig saw, reciprocating saw, hope to buy a table saw sometime soon).  I'm turning in to a regular Bob Vila!

       ahaha...its 3:26 in the morning...I have to get up for work in about 3 hours...i'm having a lot of trouble typing this...I like beer.  Its amazing how much more talkative i get when I've had a few.  Not here of course, since usually i'm too wasted to remember I even have a blog, but with my friends I mean.  Although its amazing, I never ever ever say to them some of the things I say here...why?  Time for bed.  I guess....or I could just take tommorrow off?  I'm a real chicken shit when it comes to taking time off.  Fuck.

       Its hot as hell here in Toronto.  Of course, its just at this crucial time that our air conditioning decides to crap out!  Luckily I live in our basement which is constantly nice and cool.  I couldn't imagine living without A/C...in our old house we didn't have it for a while and it was unbearable.  Hopefully it will be fixed soon.  I plan to start cutting for my MAME cabinet tonight.  Of course, I'm going to probably die of heat exhaustion since I'll be doing it out in our garage!  Going to a friend's cottage this weekend which should be fun.  Though its going to be me and two couples which kind of sucks.  Don't really like being the 5th wheel, a little awkward.  But I'm not one to turn down a cottage trip.

       Tampa won 2-1 last night...good for them.  Great to see Dave Andreychuk finally hoist the cup after 22 years.  Of course all the Flames fans (and all the bandwagoners too) are going to be bitching about a) the non-goal in game 6 and b) the charging penalty at the end of game 7.  I think the NHL was right in saying that there wasn't enough evidence to conclusively rule it a goal...from the replays it looks like its up in the air so there's no real way to tell exactly where it was in relation to the goal line.  As for the penalty in game 7, was it borderline? Yes.  But I don't think it was as sparkling clean a check as some are suggesting.  The stick was up for sure.  Bah.  This is my favourite picture from last night:   Hulk Hogan on the ice hugging Andre Roy.  Priceless.

       Another relatively uneventful weekend.  Bought the wood for the MAME cabinet, but didn't actually do anything about it.  Its just sitting in my garage at the moment.  Won't be doing anything to it tonight either, going out for wings.  If you're anywhere in the GTA, I don't know if there's a better deal than the deal on Mondays.  3 dozen of the best wings I've ever had, fries and a pitcher of beer for $23!  Its at St. Louis wings ( urlLink website ).  On Tuesdays its half-price wings, but that really doesn't work out to be as good a deal as Mondays...plus its isn't as busy Mondays.

       Went and bought the wood for the MAME cabinet yesterday.  Plan is to cut it all and start painting today!  Still haven't got all the buttons and joysticks and everything though.  Hopefully this week.  Calgary lost last night in double overtime.  Good.  Go Tampa!  Almost everybody I talk to about this seems to be shocked that I'm not cheering for Calgary because they're Canadian.  Who cares?  Bah.  Toady is the 60th anniversary of D-Day.  It really is unfathomable to think of what those guys must have gone through on those beaches.  I hear them talk about it and really have to wonder if I'd be able to do the same.  I don't think I could...then again I'm sure many of them probably never thought they had that kind of courage and bravery before the war.  One funny thing about all this hoopla though, is that 2 days before, June 4th, was the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Rome.  A lot of people forget that by the time D-Day happened, the Allies had been on the ground in Europe for almost a year.  Anyways, take some time to day to say a prayer (and I'm not even religious) for all those who served and lost their lives at Normandy.

       So I looked into how much it would be to go to Vegas.  4 nights flying from Buffalo, staying at the beyond shitty New Frontier, $534 Canadian including tax.  I can afford that and have plenty left over to waste at the nudie bars and the roulette tables!  However, there is now a new wrinkle.  My mom and sister had been talking about going away at the beginning of August and they want me to go.  They say its so my sister will have someone to do stuff with once my nephew goes to bed.  However, to me its more like I can do ALL the driving and I can babysit my nephew all the time.  I went away with them last year to California, Vegas and Arizona and thats basically what ended up happening.  My sister and I went out one night in Vegas.  Thats it.  Anyways, I had been very non-commital on the whole subject, partly because they couldn't decide where they wanted to go and partly because I'd been talking about maybe doing other stuff with friends.    So I go home last night and tell my mom (my sister wasn't there) that I was seriously thinking about going to Vegas in 3 weeks.  Right away the guilt trip starts.  "You don't want to go with us? Your nephew will be so disappointed.  You didn't have fun when we went away last time?  You said you'd come with us." To which I replied that I had a good time last time we went away, but going to Vegas with a friend is a different kind of fun that when you're hanging with your family.  Also, I pointed out that I never actually said that I was going with them, but that it was a good possibility.  And I really can't afford to go away twice, plus they're talking about going away for 2 weeks, if I go away with my friend I'll miss 4 days of work at most.  I know my sister will understand, but my mom can be absolutely miserable if you don't go along with her wishes.  One time I made the honest mistake of forgetting to get her a mother's day card (not a gift, just a card) and she wouldn't speak to me for over a week so I caved and got her flowers.  She is the master of the guilt trip and it drives me insane sometimes.

       One other thing about the MAME cabinet.  I won an auction on Ebay for a coin door, $29.99, allegedly completely working and everything.  So, the next morning I e-mail the guy.  No response.  about 36 hours after that, e-mail again.  Still no response.  Why would someone list something if they have no intention of selling?  Or if they're just trying to scam me, usually you try and take the money first then stop communicating.  Why can I not just get a god damned coin door?

       Glory be, I've actually started building the MAME cabinet.  Screwed the base together (almost fucked up royally, but figured out my mistake in time) and then attached the sides and top.  Tonight the plan is to build the monitor shelf which has to be the most well re-inforced since the TV is over 60lbs.  It really looks like an arcade cabinet now.  And all the buttons and joysticks supposedly shipped yesterday.  It would be extremely sweet if they came tommorrow, though highly unlikely.  Rounded up all the parts for the computer too.  So, barring any major catastrophes, this thing could be running by the end of next week.  *********  So my friend (who's cottage I went to last weekend, who'll I'll call S) e-mails me today and says: "I'm booking the first 2 weeks in July off, want to go to Vegas?".  Now, two things to note: 1) I absolutely love Vegas.  I don't really know why either.  I don't go to any of the clubs there.  I'm not good looking enough (or self-confident enough) to go cruising for chicks.  And I'm not about to go blow loads of money going to shows.  But there's just something about the attitude there.  The drinking 24/7.  Walking down the street with a beer in hand. 2) I went to Vegas with S a few years ago and had a blast.  Drunk all the time, winning at the tables, etc.  However, in the intervening years S has definitely changed.  He moved downtown.  He's been married (and now is in the process of divorcing).  He's changed jobs and is now way more responsible.  After his marriage, he basically no longer drinks more than a few drinks at a time.  We don't really seem to have anything to talk about other than football and hockey.    So now I'm in an interesting position.  Do I go, hoping that, even just for that weekend, he's the guy I used to know?  Getting drunk, going to the rippers, etc.  (BTW, I am not implying that you need to get drunk to have a good time, but, well, maybe I do...never said I was a role model for the kids) .  Or do I bullshit, say I don't have the cash (which I do) or can't get the time off (which I can)?  I went away with him last year, and he was like the old S until he got sick and had to stay in bed the duration of the trip, but that was before his marriage broke-up, which seemed to have triggered his latest "being responsible, not losing control" phase.  Told him I'd look into pricing and find out tommorrow.  I'm leaning towards going...maybe.

       It may be approaching time that I go see a doctor for the first time in around 11 years.  What I thought was just a stomach ache from all the beer and food from the cottage is still bothering me.  That never happens.  Maybe one day, but not three.  Plus, there's the bruise on my leg from two years ago that I got from running into a tree stump that has never really completely healed.  Plus lately I seem to get pins and needles a lot in my hands and arms and feet, which I'd imagine would be a sign of bad circulation.  Overall, I'm just one hurtin' unit.  Though when I say its been 11 years since I've gone to the doctor, its not like I've been avoiding it or I'm deathly afraid of them, I just don't really care.  I have a friend who runs to the doctor with every cold...he's had extensive x-rays and blood work done a few times, for what always turns out to be nothing.  Me, I just figure that whatever is wrong with me, my body will eventually get around to fixing.  Probably not the most scientific or healthy approach, but its worked so far.  *******  Another Ignorant Receptionist Update (to be named an IRU for short from now on): yesterday she told me the reason she couldn't answer the phone was because she had to do calculations and write out a receipt for someone.  Now, what with her being approximately 150 years old, I can accept that it may be difficult to multi-task...but who the hell can't work a calculator and answer the phone at the same time.  Also, how does that explain away all the other times that she just stares blankly at the phone or walks away when it starts ringing?  When she told me that all I could do was laugh.  She asked what I was laughing at and I just walked away to the bathroom.  To clarify for anyone reading wondering to themselves why I don't do something or say something about her: I have, many times before.  The end result being she gets told to stay at her desk, not spend too long on the phone, she does that for a few hours and then goes back to her regular ignorant ways.  In the end, she's got it made since she sucks up to the boss so goddamn much, she's got him convinced she's doing a great job.  Yeah, she does a great job for him, and fuck everyone else!  My work is so extremely disfunctional its funny.

       Cottage was pretty good, got eaten alive by mosquitos though.  And my friend's (whose cottage it was) girlfriend, who I'd only met once before, pulled some major bullshit.  We always go for a midnight boatride, just cut the motor out in the middle of the lake, have a few beers  and watch the stars.  Well, just as we're getting ready to go down to the dock, she calls him aside.  We go down thinking nothing of it.  Next thing you know, he comes down and says the boat ride is off!  Of course we ask why and he says "her mother called and left her a message that something bad was going to happen".  What the fuck is that?  For one thing, they'd already been out for a boat ride earlier (I was taking a nap) and nothing was wrong with that.  Why now?  Secondly, who really knows if that actually happened or if she just prentended to be on the phone.  Thirdly, isn't it fucking convenient that she decided to check her messages at the exact moment we're getting ready to go.  So we start pressing him, and he's like "I have to respect her wishes". WHAT THE FUCK?  What about our wishes?  What about the tradition thats been going on forever?  Its not like we were going to go out and start doing backflips off the end of the boat.  And he hadn't even been drinking all that much anyways (which is another sore point, but...).  Then she starts to try and make him feel guilty: "As long as you have lifejackets (which we always do) and a whistle I guess it would be alright, though I still won't be comfortable with you going".  Of course he caves.  Absolute bullshit.  Other than that though, it was an alright weekend.

       Construction on the MAME cabinet is progressing nicely.  Drilled out all the holes for the buttons and trackball...looking good.  My buddy who's helping me do this took the PC parts with him to put it together while he's working the night shift next week.  Next step is to give the control panel a fresh coat of paint to cover up some of the nicks it got in the drilling process, then start wiring it up.  Going to another cottage today.  This one is a friend's girlfriend's.  Went there a couple times last year, had a pretty good time.  This time there's supposed to be somewhere around 20 people which should be fun.  Gonna be a little cramped though.  The one thing that sucks about going to these cottages is that I can't swim, so subsequently I can't go waterskiing or jumping off cliffs or anything like that.  Last time I was at this cottage, I went off a rope swing, but I have to wear a lifejacket and I look pretty stupid.  Not to mention the fact that I'm big and fat and am very embarassed when I take my shirt off.  While everyone else is out enjoying the water, I'll just be sitting around drinking myself into a stupor...so its not all bad.

       Got the buttons and joysticks and trackball for the MAME cabinet yesterday (one button and the cup-holders were backordered, but have shipped from a different warehouse).  We were all stoked to start laying out the control panel and everything, but instead we just ended up getting a case of beer, drinking it and staring at the buttons.  Ahhh well, we waited this long, what's another day? Ended up drinking until 2:30am...must have had about 10 beers.  Still half-cut when I woke up this morning.  Going to another cottage this weekend.  Should be pretty cool, supposed to be around 20 or 30 people.  Don't know where everyone will sleep.  I can forsee myself ending up on the floor.  Meh, I'll be drunk (and probably peaking on mushrooms) anyways so I'm not too worried.

       Vegas trip is booked.  July 4th to 8th.  Staying at the Monte Carlo which was pretty cheap considering how nice it appears.  Last time I was there I won about $100 playing roulette there.  Centrally located too.  Can't believe that in less than 2 weeks I'll be in Vegas!  The more I think about it, the more I can't believe I was actually thinking about not going.  Stupid, stupid me.  At least I came to my senses in time.

       I've decided I will go to Vegas...asked for the time off yesterday and its no problem.  Will probably go just after the July 4th weekend.  Now just have to decide where to stay.  Leaning towards Harrah's right now - relatively cheap, centrally located on the strip and from what I recall from my last time there, it doesn't look too dirty or dingey.  I'm sure I'll have fun (I think its impossible not to).  I was already browsing the Internet last night for info on the nudie bars there (well, not really nudie bars, topless bars since for some absolutely retarded reason you can't drink and see a naked woman at the same time down there).  Some of these strip joints are massive, like the size of convention halls!  Last time I went with S (the guy I'm going with this time) we just went to Crazy Horse Too (well, we went to Olympic Garden also, but that was at like 4 in the afternoon and there was only a handful of girls working).  It was great fun there, you couldn't turn around without seeing a different, incredibly hot woman.  But hopefully this time we'll sample the local flavour a little more.  We never actually went to any regular old dance clubs though, partly because we were there Sunday to Thursday and most are only open Thursday to Saturday, but more because I can't stand dance clubs.  You can't hear anything, have to fight through giant crowds to get a drink, a pain in the ass if you ask me.  Though that attitude could explain why I never meet any women...

       Is it bad that I'm almost 26 and my mom still does my clothes shopping for me?  I figured I should have at least one set of respectable looking clothes for Vegas since my entire wardrobe consists of 2 pairs of jeans, a few pairs of shorts and t-shirts.  So she goes out, buys me stuff, brings it home for me to try on.  If I like it, I keep it.  If not, back it goes and she gets something else.  I just really really don't care that much about my appearance.  I go months between haircuts.  Same with shaving, I just can't be bothered doing it every day, so I just let it go until I look like some crazy mountain man.  I'd rather be very comfortable than worry about if my shirt matches my pants or if my hair is nicely styled.  I spend my time worrying about if I need to go to the beer store or how the Leafs are going to do next season.  Ahh well, I now have two decent looking outfits to sport in Vegas.  Surely now the ladies will be lining up around the block to get a piece of me!

       Why the hell am I at work today?  We really should get the Friday off if a holiday falls on a Thursday.  Can't really complain all that much though seeing as in aboout 48 hours I'll be boarding a plane bound for Vegas!  Made some more progress on the MAME cabinet yesterday.  My buddy brought over the computer and we were fiddling around with it...but stupid Windows 98 keeps crashing when we try and shut it down, which is not good.  Also drilled out the plexiglass that will go over the control panel to hopefully keep spilled drinks and crap from getting in and frying everything.  Could possibly get some wiring done tommorrow.

       Happy Canada Day!  And what better way to celebrate this great country's birthday than with a raging pissup.  Was up until 5am...its 11am now...I'm still half-cut, not sure why I'm even awake.  I just have this freaky internal clock that refuses to let me sleep-in.  No matter how much I could go back and lay in bed, I know I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep.

       I did finally get the coin door for my MAME cabinet that I won off of eBay.  However, its a little dented, some rust, was missing one lock and the other didn't have the key, or the hasp that actually does the locking.  But most of all, it was missing the big metal coin box that all the coins drop into.  Not really all that important, I can just put a little cardboard box under instead, but the auction said it was included so I expected to get it.  So I e-mailed the guy, and he's like 'Most people don't usually want them...but I can ship it to you for $12'.  What the fuck?  I paid for the god damn thing and he wants to charge more to ship it?  So I e-mailed him back and basically said he had 3 options: 1) ship it to me for free 2) refund half my money 3) I'll leave negative feedback and report you to eBay for fraud  Normally I don't get all riled up like this, and I don't even really care about the missing piece, but its the principle of the matter.  You say its included, then its included.  If the auction had said 'I'll throw in the coin box for an extra $10' or something, that would have been fine by me, but he didn't, so fuck him.

       So I just finished listening to the new Tragically Hip album 'In Between Evolution'.  Don't know what to say.  I like the first single, Vaccination Scar.  And another song, It Can't be Nashville Every Night was pretty good.  But there were a bunch of others that were pretty shit.  I don't know what it is with The Hip.  Maybe its just because their first albums were so good, they set too high a standard.  Fully Completely, Day For Night, Up To Here, Phantom Power: all excellent albums.  Then came Music@Work...shit.  In Violet Light was alright, but a little mellow by Hip standards.  I mean, of course they're going to evolve as artists as they get older...but they're The Hip!  You expect them to come out every album and just kick your ass with some good ol' Canadian rock.  They're still very good in concert though.   PS - Thank you for the GMail account Joanne, my one and only reader!

       So the Liberals won last night, a minority as predicted, but a much stronger minority than any of the polls predicted.  Hopefully its stable enough so as to not require another election in 6 months.

       Cottage was pretty good.  Drank a lot of beers, ate some mushrooms Saturday night (always a fun time).  Nothing majorly exciting happend though, just a lot of sitting around, which was fine by me.  Now the countdown is on until Vegas...6 days and counting.  *******  Its election day today.  Voting Liberal.  Yes, they've been involved in scandals etc. but the Reformed-Conservative party is too right wing to me.  I don't understand how you can cut taxes while still putting more money into health-care and the military?  Most of my friends don't vote, which I can't understand.  They say they're all the same\their vote doesn't make a difference etc.  But this election could be so close, those votes might make a difference.  More than likely it will be a minority government, hopefully led by the Liberals...but there might be enough anti-Liberal sentiment to let the Conservatives sneak in.  Hopefully not though.

       Back from Vegas...got home around 1am this morning, been sleeping most of the day.  It was a very good trip, other than the whole me losing $180 part.  Though I'm not actually that pissed about losing, I figured I'd gamble around $200, its just the way I lost.  I would be up $20 or $30, but instead of walking away then and there, I would keep pressing, until I got down, which would then mean I had to keep playing to try and at least get back to even, which eventually led to me having nothing...ahh well.    Some other thoughts: - stayed at the Monte Carlo ( urlLink website ).  Pretty nice hotel, reasonably cheap ($69 a night Mon-Thurs, $89 Sun since it was 4th of July).  Nothing spectacular about it though - it was very very very hot...think the highest it got was 107 degrees.  Even the wind is hot.  Although its true what they say, its a dry heat.  There's no humidity there and it makes it bearable.  If it was that same temperature here, with our humidity, I might die. - Vegas isn't as cheap as people think (maybe it is if you go off strip to some of the lower end hotel/casinos, but we didn't) - the Coyote Ugly bar at the New York, New York seems to be nothing but a tourist trap.  Pay $10 cover, to get into a tiny little room with one big bar with a platform for drunk tourists to dance on and another smaller bar and thats it...maybe because it was a Monday night, but it still sucked - every few feet on the strip there are these guys who hand out these cards for escort services which are basically porn with little stars over the naughty bits.  Its ridiculous how many there are.  Apparently they're called Slappers because they slap the cards in their hand a few times as you approach and then try and jam them in your way. - I can very easliy see how people can get addicted to gambling.  You get such a rush of adrenaline and confidence when you win that you feel invincible.  And when you ineveitbly lose, you still have that confidence that a few more hands or spins of the roulette wheel and you can be back on top.  Next time I go, I'm bringing an envelope for each day, and thats my limit for that day.  Otherwise, you can end up dropping $100 in less than an hour (not that I did, though I was tempted too just lay down a $50 on red or black a few times) - maybe it was because I was always playing $5 or $10 tables, but drink service was really slow at every casino.  Sure, I'm not a high roller, but if I'm losing money at your hotel, you should at least give me something for it.  And its not like I don't tip well, I was giving $1 a bottle hoping that would speed things up, never did though. - we couldn't find anywhere to watch the Euro 2004 final.  When we got to the hotel the game should have been around halfway through the 2nd half...so we rushed to the hotel's pub, they aren't showing it.  We figure, lets go to the ESPNZone restaurant next door at the New York, New York, they've got to be showing it, they have a billion tv's showing everything.  Nope, apparently it was only being shown on a pay-per-view basis in the US...if we wanted to watch it, they gave us the names of 2 bars that might, but by the time we got there, the game would've been over anyways.  Then, it took us forever to find out what the score even was.  It took about 45 minutes of watching ESPN's ticker until they finally got to the score, and even then, all it said was Greece 1-Portugal 0.  Never mind who scored, when they scored, if it went into extra time, nothing.  Ridiculous. - one of the older, dirtier hotels on the strip had a bar that featured mud wrestling Monday nights.  Of course we had to go.  It was great, plus the fact that you could get all you could drink draft for $15 (only Bud Light or Miller Light though, but after your 12th cup, it doesn't make much difference).  Apparently the way it worked was they got 4 girls from a strip club (Cheetah's, more on that place later)...they wrestle, and then the winner out of those 4 faces challengers from the audience.  There wasn't any nudity or anything, just the occasional nip-slip, but it was fun nonetheless.   urlLink Click here for some pictures  - the Mandalay Bay has a big shark reef exhibit that was well worth the $15 admission.  Apparently they have the only Hammerhead Shark in captivity in the US, along with a bunc of other cool exhibits like crocodiles, piranhas, jellyfish, sting-rays.  The Mandalay Bay in general is a pretty cool place...lots of eye candy there, and the pool looked like a pretty cool scene (not that I'm one for pools, but I do enjoy the scenery).  Only problem is its at the tail end of the strip and its a long walk to get to anywhere - didn't go see any shows since they were so damned expensive.  $80 for Cirque du Soleil, which is cool (I saw it a few years ago, got the tickets for my birthday), but not worth it IMO.  The magic show in our hotel, Lance Burton, was $66 for balcony seats, plus who knows if there's a 2 drink minimum or whatever.  My friend really wanted to go see on of these topless reviews for some reason.  I kept telling him though that why would we pay $37.50 to go sit miles away from the stage and watch some showgirls dance to cheesy showtunes when we could go the the strip club for roughly the same and see it up close and personal?  I think my friend was a little disappointed that we didn't go to any shows, he felt like we needed to 'do something', but I was happy drinking my beers, seeing the sights and just enjoying the atmosphere  Now, on to my inevetible strip club thougts: - never, ever, ever, ever take a cab driver's advice for what strip club to go to...they get paid by the clubs for every fare they bring there, and everyone we asked said the Spearmint Rhino...I objected but my friend took the bait so we went there first.  Utter crap.  $20 cover to get in, which is steep but the norm for Vegas strip clubs.  But the god damn place is so dark, you can't see what the hell is going on...plus there's three stages so you really can't focus you're attention anywhere.  Plus, there weren't really all that many girls.  One girl seemed to get offended when my friend asked her what was up with the tipping on pervert's row (thats what we call the row of seats that line the stage, I've always heard it called that, even by the DJs).  She said it was called Tipper's Row, and that guys gave $1 for a lick of the ear or some titplay.  Had one drink and left - from there, we went to Crazy Horse Too, the place we spent most of our time and money last trip.  Another $20 cover, but it was nowhere near what we remembered it.  Not really that many girls, and this was at midnight or so when it should be at its busiest.  Better than Spearmint Rhino, but definitely not what I remembered - Tuesday night, we decide to head to Cheetah's.  Further out in the middle of nowhere than the other two, but we decide to give it a shot.  Another $20 cover but this one actually felt worth it.  Before we could sit down, my friend was chatting up 2 girls and had one.  Beers were relatively cheap.  There were plenty of girls, and while alot of them were aggressive, they weren't too pushy.  If you told them no, they didn't have a hissy fit.  And the majority of them were very hot (though that was the same for the other 2 we went to too).  That night got one dance from a girl named Casey (though I forgot and called her Cassidy, oops)...before we even went for the dance though, while she was just sitting on my lap chatting me up she'd already reached up my shorts, had me licking her nipples, she was licking mine, blowing in my ear...it was very difficult not to blow a lot of money on her.  Lots of fun, but after the one dance she had to go up on stage, and after she got off she went off with some other dude to the VIP which was probably for the best, since if she'd come back, my Visa card probably would have made an appearance - Wednesday night, we were pretty much broke, sitting around at about midnight with nothing to do...too late to go to any shows...so, we decide, we'll flip a coin. Heads, we go back to Cheetah's, Tails, we call it a night.  Flip it 3 times and they're all tails.  Must be the coin so we get another quarter.  This one is tails too, but we say fuck it and go anyways.  Just as much fun that night as the night before...didn't see the same girl but ended up getting a couple of dances from a beautiful girl who's name I don't remember.  These dances I went up into the VIP area (which there wasn't a cover for which surprised me), and they were a little more, shall we say, full contact than the previous ones.  Good times. - Overall though, strip clubs in Vegas have nothing on the ones up here.  First of all, to serve alcohol they're only topless.  Secondly, they rape you with the cover charges, knowing that you really don't have any choice, since unless you want to go to some dive, they're all the same.  Maybe they get the hottest girls, but really, any night at Whiskey-A-Go-Go you're going to see a near equal caliber.  And the whole tipping from perverts row thing mystifies me.  Here, if you like the girl on stage, you stick $5 in your mouth, hop up on stage and she gets it from you in various ways, but you're never obligated to give anything.  More often than not, that's where you sit if you're not there to get dances...most girls won't come up and try and hustle you there.  But in the states, if you're sitting up there, you better have a roll of 1's or they'll get pissed and want to know why you're sitting there in the first place.  Weird.  That's about all I can think of right now, though I'm sure more will come to me later.  I had a great time, though I think my friend hoped we'd do more.  Definitely glad to be home though.  4 nights in Vegas is just about the right length for a trip.

       Just over 5 hours until my flight for Vegas leaves...totally stoked.  I wonder if you can buy beer to take with you at the duty free at the airport?  It would be nice to have some good Canadian beer to drink instead of having nothing but Bud down there.  Supposed to be around 40 degrees celsius down there, which means I'll probably break into a sweat that won't stop from the moment we land to the moment we leave.

        More MAME testing last night...we mounted the control panel to the box, and then the whole control panel assembly to the cabinet.&nbsp; One minor problem though, some games will only play in black and white.&nbsp; The weird thing is other games play in full colour.&nbsp; Not sure if its the cable, or the drivers for the video card or what.&nbsp; It would be more reassuring I think if they were all in black and white, that way it would be easy to assume its the cable or something.&nbsp; Another problem we had was after a few hours of playing Street Fighter and other games, the player 1 joystick stopped responsing when you try and push left.&nbsp; One of the contacts must have come loose.&nbsp; I really should have figured out some way of putting the top on a hinge so it could just swing open.&nbsp; As it is now, I have to take out about 10 screws to get the control panel off to get at the wiring.&nbsp; Ahh well, its all trial and error.&nbsp; I'm amazed we've got this far with this being the only real problem we've had.&nbsp; I'm still waiting for something to blow up on it.

       My family got me a table saw for my birthday which was pretty cool.  Of course, it comes a month too late to be of much use on my MAME cabinet.  Although I'm sure I can find a few things to cut.  Other than that, birthday was pretty blah.  My cheapskate friends couldn't even round up enough pocket change to buy a six-pack, never mind take me out for a beer.  Instead, just stayed in my basement, mixed up a drink or two and worked some more on the MAME cabinet.  Something wrong about drinking my own booze on my birthday.  Another successful test of the control panel last night.  This time, both players and the trackball, all worked fine.  Only problem was occasionally a wire would get wedged under a button causing it to stick.  Will probably have to do some clean up on the wires before we mount it to the cabinet.  Could it be done by the end of this weekend?  Its a longshot, but possible.

       So its my birthday today...26 years old.  Meh, never really do anything exciting for my birthday.  I'll probably just end up going out for a beer or two...thats about it.  First successful test of the MAME cabinet control panel last night...wired up all the controls for player 1 and it worked like a charm.  Then we wired up the player 2 controls, but didn't get around to testing those.  Tonight hopefully we can wire up the trackball, and if everything goes well, start finishing the rest of the construction (mounting the control panel to the cabinet, putting on the back, getting a marquee, etc).  Still haven't figured out how the hell to mount the coin door I got.  I kind of left my whole debate with that guy I got the coin door off of...I really can't be bothered arguing anymore.  I probably just won't leave feedback or something.  Don't know if I'd buy off eBay again.  This kind of shit can happen too easily.

       I think I might be the only person on the face of this planet that didn't really like Spiderman 2.  Don't get me wrong, the action was pretty decent and Doc Ock was done pretty well, but overall the story really bugged me.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET, STOP READING NOW.    How can he give up being Spiderman?  Even if he didn't actively go out and fight crime, shouldn't he still have his powers like spider sense and his strength?  And they really dragged out how he was tormented and wrestling with his identity.  How, in virtually every scene with Doc Ock, can you hear him coming from a mile away, but when he gets the tritium from Harry he can sneak away?  Or when Doc Ock throws the car at Peter and Mary Jane, why doesn't anyone hear him coming, but luckily Peter's spidey-sense saves them at the last second?  Did he throw the car from 5 miles away?  Also with that car throwing scene...Doc Ock is supposed to be finding Peter to find out who Spiderman is (they don't know yet), so wouldn't it be a safe assumption that nailing him with a car might kill him?  Could Peter have taken his mask off any more?  So much for his secret identity - now a whole subway car full of people know, Mary Jane knows, Harry Osborn knows.  Also, how fucking cheesy was it to have Mary Ann running from the altar to be with Peter at the end.  Overall I was disappointed.  Especially after every review said it was the best comic book movie ever and all that crap.  I'd take the first Batman any day.

       My mom and sister want me to go on this South Beach diet with them (they haven't started yet, but figure that it would be hard for them to be on it and not me).  Supposedly my aunt lost 15 lbs in 3 weeks and my uncle lost 10.  I'm pretty hesitant about it though.  From what I understand of it, for the first two weeks you basically cut out everything except very select meats, vegetables, cheese and some other crap.  Thats when the major weight loss happens.  After the two weeks, you start adding carbs, which I guess turns it into practically the same as the Atkins diet, all carbs.  From then on, if you maintain you should lose 1-2 lbs a week.  First of all, from what I gather, most of the weight loss during the first 2 weeks is mostly water loss.  From then on, its a whole lot of carbs and not much else, which doesn't seem healthy.  Plus, if at any point you stop seeing results, apparently you're supposed to repeat the first two week crash diet.  Seems sketchy to me.  Of course, when I voice my objections, they figure its just because I don't want to curb my beer drinking, not that I could possibly think it is unhealthy.  Plus, while there's no question that I could stand to get in shape and drop some pounds, for whatever reason I'm not all that motivated to do anything about it.  Maybe its because I'm lazy, or maybe I'm set in my routines or maybe its because I've accepted that I am the way I am.  As they say, "Its better to burn out than to fade away".

       Reading my pre-Vegas post, I was wondering if they'd sell beer at the duty free.  They did, but it was only 6's of Blue.  First of all, why only 6's?  All the beer makers are putting 24's of cans in the easy carry suitcases, which would be better for taking on a plane than a bunch of cans.  Secondly, all they had was dirty, dirty, dirty Blue.  No Canadian, not even any other Labatts products like Labatt Ice.  Just Blue.  I hate Blue.  needless to say, I didn't buy any.  Just stuck to drinking MGD down there which is pretty decent, though definitely isn't as good from a can.  Speaking of Vegas beer, at a bar or in the casino, when you're not given a free beer, they on average cost around $4 US.  You could go to any convenience store and get 18 cans for $16.99 (why 18?  would the extra 6 kill the average American beer drinker?).  We just bought 2 cases and a styrofoam cooler, and would just keep going back to the room to get 2 or 3 beers at a time.  Saved a few bucks like that.  Always better to pre-tank before you hit the town.

       They keep announcing on Q107 that this Monday at 7:20am there's going to be a major announcement about the future of Q107.  Not really sure what this could be?  I would absolutely be in heaven if they said they were bringing Howard Stern back, but the odds of that are probably about 1 in a billion.  Or maybe its that John Deringer, who I hate with a passion is leaving.  That would be good too - I avoid listening to Q107 until after 9am when his show is over.  All the Deringer show is is him throwing out some stupid cliche, some recycled Internet joke or trying to come off as some great guy by plugging his cause du jour, all the while him and his stupid jack-off lackeys laughing hysterically at their own jokes.  Also, I'm still bitter that they chose him to replace Stern - it was like going from eating Filet Mignon to a week old burger someone found in a urinal.  Yes, he's that bad.  Now I only get to listen to Stern an hour day in my car on the way to work, and even then the signal from Buffalo is pretty weak.  I really need to find some site on the net that's streaming it.  More than likely, they'll just announce that they're changing formats to 'Classic and New rock', or they're going to start airing the Leafs games again or something that really isn't that monumental...who the fuck knows.

       An interesting read:  urlLink http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/History/whiteb1.htm   Give this a read through.&nbsp; About the origin of 'War Against Drugs' in the US.&nbsp; Pretty interesting, how most of the laws had either a racist basis (to control the Mexicans) or out of paranoia about something that hasn't even happened yet ('We don't have a marijuana problem yet, but its inevitble so we better stop it before it starts').&nbsp; Now, I'm not a pot smoker or anything (the only drug I take is alcohol, with a few magic mushrooms now and then) but its pretty clear that the whole War on Drugs is a monumental waste of time and money.&nbsp; In 2002, 45% of the drug arrests in the US were for marijuana.&nbsp; Think about how many people's lives get fucked, how many people get a criminal record, just for smoking a joint?&nbsp; How much of the prison population is there for marijuana related offences?&nbsp; Stupid.  At least Canada is taking steps toward softening the stance on pot.&nbsp; Of course nothing major will ever happen so long as the US keeps up its policies. The political pressure would be unbearable.&nbsp; Borders would practically close, sanctions imposed.&nbsp; In the words of Trudeau: its like a mouse in bed with an elephantno matter how friendlyone is affected by every twitch and grunt.

       Last night the family trip issue came up again.&nbsp; I basically decided that I wasn't going to go.&nbsp; Instant guilt trip.&nbsp; 'Why don't you want to come?' 'You know you're nephew would love it if you came.' 'You said you would come before' (I never actually said yes, I said I'd think about it once they decided where they were going).&nbsp; I mentioned that I'd just come back from Vegas, and it would be a pretty big strain on the budget if I went away again so soon after.&nbsp; 'Well, you knew we were going away' (Yeah, but originally you said it would cost $500, now you say $1000).&nbsp;   They're planning on driving to the East Coast, down through Maine and back up through the Maritimes and then Quebec.&nbsp; Of course, I'd end up doing 99.9% of the driving.&nbsp; While I think it would be cool to go out that way, whenever I go anywhere with my mom (and to a lesser extent my sister) we never end up actually doing anything interesting.&nbsp; We just end up going shopping or something.&nbsp; I really don't know what we'd do anyways.&nbsp; Other than scenery, which I'm sure is beautiful, what else is there to do out there?  Plus, God knows it would be nice to have a week or ten days or whatever with the house all to myself.&nbsp; And finally, I happened to mention that they're both always complaining that money is very tight, so I pointed out that maybe it wouldn't necessarily be the best time to take a week off work (my sister I mean, my mom doesn't work) and blow a load of money.&nbsp; Don't think they liked me mentioning that point too much.  I was already starting to waffle last night though.&nbsp; Those damn guilt trips get me everytime.&nbsp; Though today I'm feeling a little more resolute in my position.&nbsp; Time will tell.

       I probably shouldn't have connected everything in the MAME cabinet before finishing the rest of construction.&nbsp; Not much progress is being made, but a lot of games are getting played.&nbsp; Its so hard to resist...fiddle with the wires, cut some wood, or play a game of Street Fighter 2?&nbsp; Somehow, I see Street Fighter winning that battle every time.&nbsp; That said, its amazing how much initiative and drive I've shown with this whole project.&nbsp; I didn't even devote this much energy to school (maybe thats why I flunked out of university?).&nbsp; I just find it very hard to get worked up about stuff.&nbsp; You could call it laziness I guess.  I never feel like I have the energy to do anything.&nbsp; Go golfing?&nbsp; Don't feel like all that walking.&nbsp; Go to a bar?&nbsp; Bah, its cheaper to drink at home.&nbsp; Go to a movie?&nbsp; Too expensive.&nbsp; I have an excuse for everything, basically just to get out of doing anything.&nbsp; Definitely not a good trait (among many bad traits that I have).  Lets see if we can list the rest of my bad traits shall we? - I'm a very very good liar.&nbsp; I can bullshit with the best of them without batting an eye.&nbsp; Parents, friends, boss, makes no difference.&nbsp; This is probably the only place where I tell nothing but the truth...most likely because I believe no one I actually know will ever&nbsp;read this. - I binge drink...a lot.&nbsp; Its very rare that I'll go out for one or two beers and then call it a night.&nbsp; Usually its 6 or more.&nbsp; And thats during the week!&nbsp; Weekends are basically: get shitfaced Friday night, then repeat Saturday night...also Sunday night sometimes.&nbsp; At least I don't drink alone...that might be the one thing standing between me and full-blown alcoholism. - I have absolutely no backbone.&nbsp; Definitely a follower, not a leader.&nbsp; I let people walk all over me all the time.&nbsp; I never speak up, never butt in, I'm just content to stay in the shadows.&nbsp; If someone is asking a question, and I know the answer, unless they directly ask me, I'll just keep my mouth shut.&nbsp; Also goes a long way to explain my non-existant success with women. - I swear like a drunken sailor (though amazingly I could count the times I've sworn in front of my mom on one hand...just the way I was raised I guess).&nbsp; Pretty much any foul word you can think of, I utter on a daily basis (mostly to myself). - I have a bad self image and do nothing to change it.&nbsp; I'm fat, I know it, I know what I could do about it, but I choose not to (could be tied in to the laziness). - I overanalyze everything.&nbsp; I'll have a 5 minute debate with myself whether or not I should call someone, worrying that I might be bothering them, annoying them, etc.&nbsp; Typical discussion with myself: 'Should I go out?&nbsp; Well, I'd like to, but that bar will probably be packed, so we won't get a seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll have to wait forever for a drink.&nbsp; Plus, the music will probably be loud so I won't be able to hear what anyone is saying.&nbsp; And I don't know some of the people who are going.&nbsp; I should probably just stay home'.  Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head...I'm sure there's more though.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong though, I'm not saying its all bad.&nbsp; I think I'm a very generous person, easy to get along with, caring, etc.&nbsp; But I always focus on the negative, rather than revel in the positive (hey, another bad trait!).

       I think I may have made a minor screw-up on the MAME cabinet.&nbsp; I've screwed on the control panel, but I still need to get in there to wire up the coin door (each coin slot has a switch that is triggered when a coin passes through it).&nbsp; Plus, it'll be a bitch to make the cut-out for it with the control panel still mounted to the cabinet (though not impossible).&nbsp; Its not really a big deal taking the control panel off, but that would be the third or fourth time I'd be unscrewing it, and eventually the screw holes will start to get fucked up.&nbsp; But it has to be done, unless I just don't actually wire up the coin switches, just the lights, and just put the coin door in because it looks cool.&nbsp; Dunno.&nbsp; I'll investigate my options tonight. &nbsp; ******* &nbsp; Went to St. Louis for wings last night and then over to a buddy's for some beers and video game football (I won both games we played...yes, I'm the master).&nbsp; Drank 12 beers in about 3 hours...was a little drunk.&nbsp; They were just going down like water (they often do).

        Fairly uneventful weekend.&nbsp; Friday went out and got drunk, crashed at a friend's place.&nbsp; Saturday, got drunk again.    &nbsp;  Still haven't figured out why MAME is playing some games in black and white.&nbsp; Tonight will probably try different cables, maybe a different version of MAME.    &nbsp;  ******    &nbsp;  Apparently Rogers is hooking up with Yahoo for all the e-mail and stuff.&nbsp; And any websites created after July 13th are on Geocities, which means forced advertising and cookies and all that crap.&nbsp; My site, apparently will be as is 'until further notice', though I'm sure its just a matter of time until they force everyone to switch.&nbsp; Probably time to start looking for a new place to host this.    &nbsp;

       I am covered in mosquito bites, was sitting out on my friend's patio drinking Wednesday night.  The weird thing is, I just noticed them (and started scratching them like mad) today.  Felt nothing yesterday...maybe I was still drunk yesterday?  All the alcohol in my blood delaying their development?  Who knows.  Really though, do mosquitos serve any purpose whatsoever?  Would the ecosystem be horribly damaged if we somehow eradicated each and every one of them?  Are there any bugs or animals who exclusively eat mosquitos?  Death to all of them I say!

       Its a pretty bad thing when you wake up, know you posted something to your blog but can't remember exactly what you wrote.  Should probably stop those drunken late night posts.  Feeling pretty shitty today.  Further to my complaining about penthouse.com, you may be wondering why I'm paying for porn when its so readily available everywhere else on the internet.  Honestly, I don't know why either.  Partially though, its so god damn frustrating wading through the bullshit sites and popups and all that.  One day it struck me as a good idea, so I signed up.  Really though it was, as I drunkenly rambled, inspired by a desire to get all the pictures of Kyla Cole that they have.  Something about her just fascinates me.  Particularly her eyes, they're just mesmorizing.  Personally, I prefer Penthouse over any of the major porn mags.  Playboy tries to be too artsy, and Hustler is a tad too hardcore for my tastes.  Plus, I figured it would be better to subscribe to some well established site than one that might fold tommorrow and make off with my credit card info.  I kind of go through stages with porn.  For a while, I'll be almost addicted to it, downloading everything I can (more than I know what to do with).  Then after that, I get bored with it.  But eventually I come back to it and start downloading like mad again.

       I have to admit something. that is sort of embarassing (though not really surprising for anyone who read through this whole blog)...I joined penthouse.com...really because I'm infatuated with Kyla Cole ( urlLink official site ).  But, after paying however much I've paid, I'm a little disappointed.  The last few 'pictorials' they've posted have been nothing more than screen-captures from movies!  I'm not paying all this money to see some fucking screen-captures!  Give me some new, high quality shit from the magazine (or shit that couldn't make it).  I still maintain that Kyla Cole is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, though she really could shave a little better (though I guess that's the European influence in her).  Anything more than a little landing strip is a bit offsides.  BTW, I'm pretty drunk and having a lot of difficulty typing.

       I've been lurking around the recently opened forums at  urlLink howardstern.com  and its just a mess.  Last I checked it claims there are over 95,000 registered users, and its been open for maybe a month, if even?  Only problem is, most of the posts are of the 'you suck' variety.  As in 'Howard Sucks', 'Artie Sucks'.  Let's see, currently, the first 5 topics are:  - Who is the hottest woman on the board - Howard was being such a gay bitch today about this BB - Savanna Sampsons def the hottest porn chick - Beth Is A Moron - Positive thread for Howard...  Its practically impossible to read.  Never mind the huge amount of moronic posts, but there's so many on there posting so much stuff, threads that were on the first page one minute are down to the 4th page the next.  I'll stick to the forums over at  urlLink sternfannetwork.com .  Slightly less crazy.

       I don't know why its bothering me so much, but Q107 is still billing their announcement about Kim Mitchell as big news.  On their homepage, you click on 'The Future of Q107' to read the press release.  How's that the future of Q107?  Its just the new afternoon guy, who I'd be surprised lasts 6 months.  Radio really really sucks ass.  I have to start bringing my iPod to work with me.   Started working on rigging up some speakers for the MAME cabinet last night.  Took apart these big old computer speakers.  Plan to just mount the speakers and the board so that I can keep the digital connections and volume control, so I don't have to try and wire up something myself.  My friend got our marquee printed at his work last night and brought it over...looks wicked.  Just have to figure out how to mount that too.  I have to stop letting people come over to play it, because when they do, no work gets done.

       Well, the family trip has now apparently changed from driving to the East Coast to taking a cruise paid for by my dad.  So, upon further consideration, I believe I'll change my anti-trip position and go along.  Fuck, how can you turn down a free cruise?  Don't know exactly when or where we're supposed to be going yet though.  Nothing else really going on right now.  Its the long weekend this weekend, but doesn't really look like I'll be doing anything...which is fine by me really.

       So what was Q107's big announcment?  That Kim Mitchell will be doing the afternoon slot from 2-7.  Whoop-dee-fucking-do.  I'd hardly call that a major announcment about the future of q107 like they were billing it.  Ricky Williams, star running back of the Miami Dolphins has decided to retire.  At 27.  Less than a week before training camp opens.  WIth every other major free agent having already signed.  Everyone knew he was a little loopy, but this came right out of left field.  He says he wants to go out and find the 'truth'.  Here's the truth Ricky, you royally fucked over the Dolphins.  If he'd retired at the end of last season, fine.  Or at least if he'd mentioned it to someone on the team, they could have had some sort of contingency plan.  But no, he didn't bother mentioning it to the coach until last Friday.  Now, they're fucked.  They'll probably have to trade someone in order to get a decent back, and anyone half-way good won't come cheap, since the other teams know the position the Dolphins are in.  Today, his agent is saying that you never know, he might be back for the start of camp.  But really, how can he?  He's just destroyed any trust he might have built up with the team.  Should he come back, everyone will just be waiting for him to quit mid-season or something.  Stupid asshole.  Got the coin door mounted on the MAME cabinet.  Looks good, just needs a little touching up here and there.  Also, the lights aren't working, though I think its because I thought they were 5 volt when they might actually be 12.  Might just have to buy a transformer or something from Radio Shack.

       Wow, I just puked.  Sent everybody that was here home.  My throat burns like hell.  Puking is the worst feeling...I sat for about 15 minutes feeling like I might have to, then all of a sudden...bam!  Not fun.  Lucklily enought though, I made it to the bathroom in time so there's no carpet scrubbing for me.

       Jesus fucking Christ...things go from bad to worse for the Dolphins.  Now apparently David Boston, a free agent signee this year who was supposed to take pressure off Chris Chambers, went down with a season ending knee injury.  What the fuck?  This season is basically a write off.  The Dolphins will be lucky to finish at .500.  God I hope there's a hockey season this year, otherwise I won't know what to do with myself this fall and winter.

       Metallica is coming to Toronto sometime in October, tickets go on sale tommorrow.  The cheapest seats are $49 plus tax and service charge and all that other bullshit.  Floors are $99.  Now I love Metallica and all (old Metallica, up to and including the black album), and yes, I did pay $105 for floors to the Summer Sanitarium tour last year (but that was for Metallica, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit and the Deftones), but I can't see myself paying probably around $65 or more to see Metallica and Godsmack(???) from the nosebleeds at the ACC.  Better off just staying home and watching the Live Shit DVDs.  Why are concerts so god damn expensive?  Is it Ticketmaster?  The bands being greedy?  The venues charging alot?  Damned if I know, but I do know that I don't go to a lot of concerts because of it.     Probably going to this Festival of Beer thing down at Fort York tommorrow.  Supposed to be a bunch of breweries and other shit.  $20 to get in though, and you only get 5 drink tickets, and as far as I know, those are only little sampler cups, not pints or anything.  Extra tickets are $1 each I think.  Anyways, said I'd try it.  Kind of worried though because the guy I'm going with said this other guy said it was great, of course the guy who said it was great is a pretty big pussy who's wiped after 3 or 4 beers, goody two-shoes type.  Guess its more for the beer conniseur, not my type who will drink practically anything as long as it gets me drunk.  But, what's the worst that can happen I guess.

       ESPN is reporting that apparently Ricky Williams wouldn't mind playing for the Raiders next year ( urlLink story ).  I hate this stupid ass more and more every day.  I guess Ricky must have found the 'truth' already, boy that was quick.  Hey jackass, you openly admitted you regularly smoke pot and just use masking agents to pass the drug tests...you don't think the NFL would be watching you like a hawk should you return?  Oh yeah, and there's the matter of that third drug test you failed that led you to retire, you know, the one that would have meant a four game suspension?  That suspension doesn't just disappear because you retire.  If you ever come back to the league, you'll be sitting for a few games.  And then, when you inevtibly fail your next drug test, that'll earn you an indefinite suspension.  Oh, and one more thing Ricky, you're still under contract to the Dolphins stupid.  You're no free agent...any team that was dumb enough to sign you would have to compensate the Dolphins.  What team, even one as fucking loopy as the Raiders, would give up a bunch of picks and cash or whatever for you?  Two teams have already got burned by you: the Saints gave up their entire draft just for you, and the Dolphins dropped a crap load of picks to get you.  Why can't you just fucking move to the middle of nowhere, smoke your dope and commune with nature?  Just fuck off already.

       I created my fantasy football league for this year for my friends and I.  Its ridiculous how wrapped up I (and every other football fan I know) get in this.  During the season, I'll spend hours and hours every week fine tuning my team, thinking about various trades, combing the waiver wire for unplucked gems.  Last year I won one of the leagues I was in and missed the playoffs in the other.  Its an odd sense of satisfaction you get winning one of these.  But this year is the first that I'm actually playing against anyone I actually know (the others have been random people on the Internet).  This should up the trash talking factor significantly, plus make trades more interesting in that you can actually meet\call the guy and work something out, instead of just make an offer and have it get rejected.  Plus, there will probably be money riding on it this year, and betting makes everything more fun.

          I just finished downloading the first 4 seasons of the awesome show "Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist".  Its a cartoon that ran from 1995 until 1999.  Its hard to describe what its about...think Curb Your Enthusiasm, only animated, but not animated well (they called it Squigglevision, again, hard to explain).  There were basically two parts of the show...one about Dr. Katz's life with his unemployed son Ben and his bitchy receptionist Laura...the other about his patients stories'(usually comedians doing bits, which were animated).  They had some pretty big comedians too, Ray Romano, Conan O'Brien, Al Franken (those are just the ones I remember off the top of my head).  I find it hilarious, though some people I know don't.  I know I'm not doing a very good job selling it, but it really was a great show.  Download an episode or two if you get a chance.   Speaking of downloading, this discovery was made possible by me joining the  urlLink Something Awful  forums.  You have to pay $10 to join, but they're well worth it.  Not only is there an unbelievable amout of activity (something like 35000 members) talking about practically any subject you can imagine, but they also have a wicked file area where you can find practically anything.

       Long weekend is over and done with.  Nothing really exciting happened.  Friday, stayed home and got drunk.  Saturday went to a friend's house and got drunk.  Sunday, recovered from the preceeding two days.   Yesterday, did a bunch of work on the MAME cabinet.   Got my speakers mounted, sounds a hell of a lot better than the TV speakers that we were using before.  Also put up the marquee.  It looks OK, but not perfect.  For one, I had a hell of a time cutting the plexiglass so it didn't turn out exactly straight.  Plus, since we couldn't get the marquee printed as one sheet, you can see the line where we taped the two pieces together.  But, it will have to do for now.  All thats really left to do now is put on the back panels, fill in a few spots, touch up the paint in a few others, and then try and move the fucking thing into place, which is only a few feet backwards from where it is now, but I can tell its going to be a bitch to move.

       One other thing I remembered about the beer festival (its probably not a good sign when I'm just now remembering things that happened 4 days ago).  The thing was shutting down, I was just standing there downing my last beer, waiting for everyone to congregate so we could head out.  Suddenly, this girl complete with piercings and tats, comes out of nowhere, starts slapping my beer gut like it was a set of bongo drums and yelling 'GIVE 'ER!'  This probably went on for about 30 seconds, and I just stood there in stunned disbelief!  Then she started rambling incoherently about something or other, and started doing it again!  The only thing that saved me was some guy over on the lawn doing jumps over a bunch of people sitting on the ground, so she ran over to be a part of that.  It was just a little weird.

       Here at work, we have a mens bathroom, with just a toilet since the urinal is broken and no one has ever bothered to get anyone to come and fix it.  Anyways, why the fuck do some people piss on the toilet seat?  Is it that fucking difficult to lift the seat?  Do these same people enjoy sitting down to take a shit in puddles of piss?  If they see they have, for some bizarre reason, pissed on the seat why can't they wipe it off instead of leaving it to get hard and crusty for the next person who comes along?  It is really mind boggling that some people have absolutely no sense of cleanliness or respect for the other people who work here.  Just felt like ranting about that.

       I don't know why, but I feel pretty shitty today.  Maybe the weekend's drinking is catching up to me or something.  Just feel generally nauseous.  One thing I failed to mention about the Beer Festival night...I went with the same guy I went to Vegas with.  He's always bitching and moaning about how he never gets to drink with the guys anymore (he lives downtown, everyone else lives in Pickering) and how he hasn't seen so and so in so long.  Well, when I told him I was going to this barbeque and that everyone was going to be there, at first he was all gung ho.  Then a few minutes later, after the girlfriend had a word with him, he decided he would go, but would go back down to Toronto that night for some reason.  Then finally he concluded he was too drunk to bother coming back to Pickering.  Never mind the fact that when I left them, he was at the liquor store buying beers to take back to his friends' place.  Its not like he had to work the next day.  Its not like he had nowhere to stay in Pickering (his parents were away at their cottage so he could have crashed there).  I get the feeling that his girlfriend doesn't really like us, or all the drinking we do, or Pickering in general.  Whatever.

       The Festival of Beer yesterday turned out to actually be pretty cool.  All kinds of different breweries were there.  Only problem is, by the time you are on your 7th or 8th glass, it gets hard to a) tell the difference between beers and b) remember which beer it is you are drinking.  Almost didn't get in though, when we got there a sign on the gate said they were sold out and this bitchy security guard out front kept yelling that if you didn't have advance tickets, you weren't getting.  So, we figured we were fucked, and just waited there for our other friend.  Well, after about 30 minutes, he arrived, but he went to a different gate.  He called to see where we were, we told him we were waiting for him so we could go to a bar or something because it was sold out, and then he told us it wasn't sold out where he was.  At that point, the security guard must have heard me, because she then decided that that was the perfect time to maybe tell us that 'oh, there might still be tickets available at the other gate'!?!?!  She couldn't have said something half an hour earlier?  Or said that to all the people that got turned away, thinking they couldn't get in?  Bullshit.  But, we got in and had a good time.  After that was over, came back to Pickering for a bbq at a friends place.  Got pretty drunk (well, I was already drunk when I got there...got drunker I guess) and passed out.  I don't know what it is, but lately I seem to pass out nearly every time I'm drinking.  Maybe I'll have to start taking caffeine pills before I go out drinking or something.
