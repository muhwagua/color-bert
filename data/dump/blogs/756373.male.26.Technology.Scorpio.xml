      Sweet romance, pt II  As promised. --- Quite a few years ago I was invited to spend a weekend with a friend of my sister's and a few buddies. Everything was set up for a blast - no wrinklies (we'd call our folks 'wrinklies' back then. Yup, childishness and immaturity was order of the day...), just us, a boatload of booze and hemp and the beauty of untamed nature. Not that we were bothered with nature. We spent most of our free time playing pool (they had a pool table, yay) and listening to music while under the influence/stoned. Like I said, young and stupid.  Anyway, on the way there, the hostess started getting touchy-feely with me, holding hands and giving me the old batty-eyes routine. I won't say I wasnt interested, but she just wasn't really my type. In retrospect, I should have persued a possible relationship - she was outspoken and vocal as opposed to my timid and shy - a perfect medium to extract me from my shell, but when you're 17 and a geek, fear is all you know.  Through the weekend she , at first, did everything short of strip naked to show me her intent of dragging me into the sack with her. Later on though, it seemed mindgames and playing hard-to-get became more appropriate - just as I started showing interest. My frustration began mounting. Inner turmoil and a desire to just take advantage of the situation mingled with my own insecuirity complex and fear of rejection produced a roiling thunderhead of conflicting emotions which pretty much paralysed me. Before I knew it, 2 days had passed and it was time to go home. Nothing had happened. I could almost  smell  her dissapointment - I could certainly feel my own gnawing away at me. Our lift arrived to return us to the capital, and we began our unfomfortable trip home. Somewhere along the dirt road, the pickup broke down. We had to walk a few kilo's to the main road. And as we were walking along quietly, I realised just what a waste the trip had been - how I had fucked it up. Our chirpy hostess made some comment which I can't even remember - I think she mocked us for walking slowly or something - and I snapped. At the wrong person. I called her a lousy hostess. I shat her out for such a lousy weekend. I ranted I wanted nothing to do with her, and stormed off. Funny how you can do and say exactly the  wrong  thing, and so spectacularly, when you are young and stupid. The lift fixed his truck, picked us up, and we returned home in one of those really long uncomfortable silences that you remember for your whole life. I could have said sorry then. Stubbornly, I chose to hold onto selfish anger. Thereafter we saw little of each other. I met her the last time about a year or so ago, and she had really flowered into a beautiful, mature friendly  married  young woman. We talked a short while, but I could see a glint of vehemence behind her eyes. Like me, she still remembers that weekend.  At least we have something in common.  Both of us hate me. ---

      Ahhh, sweet romance. Bishop sent over an excerpt from his private weblog. And, well, it's pretty damn funny, so I'm posting it. Here ya go. Hmmbwahahah...  }:-D . I'll post another 'horror story' of my own a bit later.  ---- Under the sea   Me and a group of friends went to the coast over a long weekend. Along on the trip came a hot 16 year old ( sister of a friend ). Things developed well between the two of us and on the Sat night 4 of us in the group decided to go for a midnight swim. We had been drinking a lot and it seemed like a brilliant plan. The moon was full, the water warm, and on the horizon was a pleasure cruiser, lit up like a Christmas tree. It could not have been more romantic.The other couple stayed on the beach, making out, and me and the babe went for a dip.   Pretty soon she decided she wanted to be a "mermaid" and she stripped down. Completely. Stark naked. It is a lovely picture to imagine, and imagine is exactly what I had to do, since I left my contact lenses back at the house! I could see nothing but a vague, sexy blur. Light and dark patches combining to tease my over active imagination. We chatted while splashing around in the waves. "You know", she said, "I have a problem." "What sort of problem?", I asked curiously. "I cannot say no to people", she replied.   Now, when a naked girl tells you that she cannot say no, it can mean only one thing. A more studly guy would have grabbed her right there and given her a night to remember. Sadly, I am not a studly guy, so I just panicked and nearly drowned. After inhaling half the ocean I made it back to dry land, where I discovered that the entire group ( nearly 12 people ) had come down to the beach to watch me score.   After a round of applause, a cold beer and some rather blunt advice, I was thrown back into the ocean. Here I couldn't find the girl again. Remember that I was not wearing contacts and was 80% blind at this stage. After much shouting back and forth ( and getting conflicting directions from the shore ), I finally asked her to keep talking till I get to her. Instead of talking, she started singing. Opera. Singing quite well too. The full moon above, waves splashing around me and a naked girl calling me to her like some siren out of Greek legend. This was surely one of the finest moments in my life.   When I finally reached her things were different. Seems that in the time I was gone, she has changed her mind about the situation. She splashed around like some flirting sea fairy, always one wave ahead of me, never letting me get too close, but still luring me on. After about 20 minutes of this, I gave up. I was too unfit ( and too drunk ), to catch her. So I went back to shore. She joined me there and we dried off and walked silently back to the house, hand in hand. We walked into the house and... I collapsed on a sofa and passed out.   I think it is time I quit drinking. ---

      Banks R Teh Suck  Jesus. I am really pissed right now. Just got back from my (soon to be ex) bank, where I had attempted to draw some cash,  MY  cash out of  MY  fucking bank account. Money  I  worked for. My money.  Mine . What does the fucking retarded teller tell me? Because I have a cheque account, I have to use a cheque to draw money. Not a withdrawal slip. What.The.Fuck? For the last year and a half that I've been with this retarded monkey-fuckpole of a bank, I've been doing my withdrawals by simply filling out slips. It's quick and convenient and costs me little. Suddenly, I have to use my chequebook.  Why ? I'll tell you why. So they can make the 20 bucks or whatever it is they charge me for a cheque transaction. Why wasn't it always this way? Why is my bank the only one that  requires  a person to use a cheque to draw money? Simple, really - they are going down the shitter, and instead of doing the respectable thing , the  smart  thing by taking care of their exhisting clients, they rather decide to  fuck  their loyal customers right in the ass. What the  fuck  kind of mentality is that? No seriously, what the  fuck ? A bank supposedly set on customer care pulls a dumbshit stunt like this? I banked with this tiny little bank because I felt I should support local business, instead of relying on a bigger foreign bank like Standard or First National, but obviously they choose not to support me as I have supported them. If I can't even draw my own money by simply walking into a branch and filling out a withdrawal slip, then they don't deserve my account. Hell, they don't deserve  anyone's  accounts. They deserve to go down the shitter, they deserve to have their Board of Directors live in cardboard boxes and beg for scraps. I am sick and fucking tired of the system pushing people around like this. I only use a bank because I have to (for payroll) - otherwise I'd keep my cash under my mattress or something. I have had it. Not only is this dumbfuck dipshit cockgurgling fuck of a bank losing a customer, but an  up and coming  customer as well. They have just lost out on a homeloan and a car loan from me. Fuck them. Fuck them and the horse they rode in on.

      Pepsi rocks In part 2 of this Friday's blog, I'm gonna go on about the merits of Pepsi. Now, I'm a classic, die-hard coke fan. Coke rocks. I've been drinking Coke since I was about 7 years old.Which explains a lot, now that I think about it. However, recently I've been taking to Pepsi  just to be different (coz I get down like that, I'm a regular crazy person, hide your wives and daughters).  Oddly, despite the initial reaction to want to vomit my guts out (I think Coke puts something in their juice that causes Coke consumers to retch violently when consuming any other non-Coke related product.), it sort of grows on you. It's hard to describe, but Pepsi tastes 'crisper'. It's hit the point where I prefer an ice cold Pepsi to a Coke. Like I said. Crazy.

      Utter and complete laziness. Ever had one of those days where you just don't wanna do anything? Like, a complete and total lack of will or desire to even  try . Complete lethargy. You know how  hard  it is to get anything done when you're in one of those moods?  Can't even pick up a phone. Too plain useless to even take an hour off work to wander aimlessly through town. Well, that's what I'm feeling now. Sure, I  could  blather on about some contentious issue. But I just don't have it in me right now. Have a nice weekend folks.

      69 hits! Whoo! Just got my 69th hit. Yee ha.  69 is a  very  special number... To celebrate, here's a short 'sexual' story from my life depicting just how pathetic I am. Send me yours (anonymously of course) and I might post it here for all to laugh at. It's VERY short.  When i was a teenage'd kid, i'd smoke a lot of pot. One day at this guy's house we all got high. There was a hot chick there. She took off her top. I was so stoned, I could only stare. To this day I wish I had done something more. You only get chances like that so many times in one lifetime. Carpe diem, baby.

      Burning a hole... Well, here I am with a wad of cash in my pocket and no idea what to buy with it. My salary check went through yesterday and I have almost 9 grand to spend. This is probably the first time in my life I've had this much cold cash to burn. So, I find myself with a load of dough, and I can't decide what to do with it. Thoughts of doing the responsible thing, investing it and so on cross my mind. Or how about paying debts? That would be smart? Right? Right. So, let's see, I need a new set of headphones, and the Warcraft3 Collectors Edition, some new tunes, maybe a nice new jacket, an amp and sub for my car, a big-screen TV, a hard disk and CD/RW/DVD drive for my 'puter... So much for saving.

      Ads Suck. Not in much of a blogging mood today. The only issue that popped into into my rather (currently) empty brain, is just how much TV ads suck these days. Suck, suck, suckity suck. Uber suck to the N'th degree.Yesterday was the first day in ,what could very well be an entire  decade , where I sat down to watch around 3 hours worth of prime-time TV, and being that I could not find the remote to switch channels, I was forced to sit through the ads. Hordes of them. All inane, all repeating themselves every 10 minutes. I endured it all in order to catch Scrubs and The Education of Max Bickford, but just  barely . Normally, ads never bothered me 'coz I don't normally watch TV, but recently my sattelite tv channel has been showing some pretty decent stuff. Unfortunately it means I am now regularly subjected to the horror that is TV advertising.  Thank the Lawd I can switch channels during ad breaks. Although I have no doubt that TV channels will someday 'lock' channels during ad-breaks to force us to watch the lousy things. I lost the link, but there was some nutcase tv-exec interviewed on CNN or something a few months back, who was suggesting that switching channels during an ad-break was akin to theft. Yes, I know, how absolutely fuckin  bizarre . I tell ya, society is going straight to a neon-lit hell.

      Pleh. Never realised anyone out there actually  reads  this drivel. Friend of mine, Thorian, bumbled across the site and emailed me about it. I guess there are others out there who feel as I do. For those who don't, all I can say is, sorry, take no notice,everyone goes through these black moods occasionally. Think happy thoughts, flowers and shit. Why the sudden change of heart, you may wonder. Well, getting your first real payslip from your new job can do that to you. It's weird, having money. Lots of money. I'm sitting here thinking,  and a squeaky little voice intones - "Can money make you happy? Can it really?". But then another , louder, much more obnoxious voice in the back yells" Fuck  yeah! You can buy  all  sorts of crazy shit now, dog! Youse goin  shoppin  come payday, brother, and you is gonna be buyin all dat fly shit you bin wantin! 70cm TV? You betcha sweet ass! Dozens of the heaviest of heavy metal cd's? Aint that the truth, cornbread! Dat Wacraft 3 Collectors Edition box you been moonin about? It's yours, baby! Go crazy, Broadway style!" To those who say money can't buy happiness, I quote : "The best things in life are free But you can give it to birds and bees I want money Yeah, that's what I want."  Party on Garth.

      Only the strong survive. Have you ever really realised that this world holds no place for you? One of my favourite songs currently is "Only the strong survive", by Flaw. Listening to it, a familiar emotion surfaces. Sometimes I get this feeling that I should have died at birth, or at a young age. I was not born 100% normal. Nothing too weird, mind you, rather I was born with a condition that may have resulted in my death a few years later had the doctors not operated when I was around 5 years old. Today I am a pretty much a normal guy - at least on the outside. Overweight, not much to look at and so on, but otherwise normal. Despite this though, I just can't really get along with my fellow man. Sure I have friends, but not real  friends , not the kind of close buddies that you share everything with. Perhaps I distance myself from them, perhaps they distance themselves from me, who knows. I guess I crave loneliness, as if by shunning the world that shunned me, I return the favour. It's the same with those of the opposite sex - I've never really been in a serious or meaningful relationship. Perhaps it's because I'm not actively seeking one, perhaps it's something more - perhaps it's a subconscious thing, a knowledge or instinct  that the weak should no be allowed to reproduce for fear of polluting the gene pool. We are animals after all. Can other human-animals 'sense' or smell, if you will, that I was meant to die at a young age? Had the miracle of modern science not been around, natures law of "Survival of the fittest" would have dictated that, at 7 or so years old, I would have been buried. Not walking around, leading a life today. Can people 'see' this? That I am not one of the 'strong', that I am one of the weak, that I was not meant to survive? Sometimes I feel hollow inside. Like my soul was meant to fly free at that age, but is now instead tied to this hollow carapace, doomed to walk an Earth that turned it's back on me. . It's not a happy feeling. It also explains the deluge of conflicting emotions felt almost daily. It explains the impossibility to 'fit in'. It explains why some people, particularly those 'perfect' specimens, tend to take an instant dislike to me. It explains this useless self pity that follows me around like a hungry dog. And it explains why my sole ambition in life seems to be to find a comfortable spot to await the inevitable. Get a job. Earn a decent salary. Use loads of useless materialistic crap to buffer myself from the world. Wait for time to go by, wait for the breathing to stop. Perhaps then I can find peace. I do not expect to enter paradise, if there is one. I just hope that such animosity does not result in an eternity of torment. All I can hope for , is that death is like a long, eternal, dreamless sleep. That wouldn't be so bad.

      Do.Not.Watch.Black.Knight  A worse movie I have not seen in quite some time. I'm a bit of a Lawrence fan (even though I'm THE incarnate avatar of Whiteness), ever since Bad Boys and his sterling performance in Nothing to Lose (one of the best comedies I have ever seen.). But Black Knight is such an example of mass-produced Hollywood  shit , that it will take quite some doing to restore my faith in Mr Lawrence. He should have his agent shot. What with being  black  and all, he could just have him 'hit' in a driveby. Obviously Mr Lawrence is content to live within the stereotype, as is evident in Black Knight, so why the hell not?

      Battle of the Sexes, round two  As in any argument that continues for too long, it's only a matter of time before logic and reasoning are thrown out the window, and it comes down to slander and name-calling. I am referring to  urlLink this thread  on Prophecy. The one about the whole skinny women and eating disorders thing. It wasn't long before terms like 'misogynist' and 'male chavinist' were being thrown around carelessly like confetti at a wedding. I stated in that thread that the thoughtless use of a term like 'misogynist' is akin to labelling someone a racist for merely stating the obvious - that most crimes around the world are committed by black people. Now, I am far from a racist - racism in any form sickens me to my stomach, but the plain  fact  is that, statistically, black people are more likely to engage a criminal lifestyle than any other race. I have no concrete ideas as to why - I can only surmise that perhaps it's because , in South Africa, such a large percentage of them live in squalid conditions and have little alternatives to crime in order to secure the money needed to survive. However, this does not explain why the majority of crimes in, for example, America - the land of the free and equal opportunity - are committed by African-Americans. Who happen to be a minority there. It's curious. But I digress. There comes a point in an argument where you just don't get a kick out of it anymore. Quoting facts and figures and statistics, arguing with logic and reason, helps  zilch  if the other party refuses to dance to the same beat. It illustrates another huge difference between the sexes - a man knows when to give up, he knows when he's beaten, he knows when he's  wrong . But as any guy who's had an argument with a girlfriend/wife/sister/etc can attest to, women are  never  wrong. They have this remarkarble knack of twisting an argument around to make  you  look like the one with the problem. The female version of the verbal rope-a-dope. And like dopes we always fall for the trap. We guys can never, ever win an argument with a woman if we try and win it on their terms. They'll always get the last word, they'll always make it look like the fact that they are fucked in the head is somehow our fault. You know the drill. "It's men's fault that we starve ourselves because it's men that pressure us to look like this because men like skinny women". Newsflash. Go take a look through Playboy and Penthouse before assuming that what men want are the ridiculously thin models in Cosmo mag. Guys don't like women who are too thin, or too fat, and I think the most important thing in a good looking woman is a pretty face. You'll certainly NEVER find an anorexic in a men's mag. I'll tell you one thing, working in an office with two other women is really enlightening. The shit they talk about... Anyway, enough of this battle of the sexes thing. It's a fight that's been fought for generations, with no clearly discernable winner, and no obvious, forseeable winner (if there can even be one) for some time to come. I wash my hands of the whole thing. --- In other news : It's funny how some computer games - often the ones you love the most - can incite emotions like rage and anger and fear and jubilation in a person. I am referring to multiplayer Warcraft 3 here. I happen to be one of those un-competitive gamers out there, I try not to take it all too seriously, I certainly don't spend every waking hour away from work practicing. When Counterstrike was the order-of-the-day, I would play it on weekends only. CS never really got me hot and bothered. If I was winning, I was winning, If I was losing, so what. It's been the same with most FPS games - Quake3, UT, and so on. I never really felt the desire to be good at them. I never took them seriously. They were just games. But Warcraft 3 is another story. I find myself  wanting  to play, to practice, every night, whether it be versus a PC AI or against other players on Battle.Net. When I win, I feel good about myself. When I lose, I feel like the greatest failure on the planet, and that feeling incites me to perhaps try again and do better. Being in a clan like  urlLink Chickenhead , a clan where 'l337ness' is not required, perhaps even discouraged, helps remind me that despite winning a goodly portion of games, I am no better than anyone else. Losing to some seriously skilled players is very humbling as well. However, being the usual 'whipping boy' in FPS's, the taste of victory in an Warcraft3 is especially compelling, a feeling I've never really known. It's a feeling one could get used to, but should'nt. I can imagine myself turning into one of those 'l337' players who look down on and sneer at the none-too-skilled usual players. It's a scary thought. I never want to become part of that class of gamer, but at least now I understand  why  they exist.  This weekends diary looked something like this. -Friday night, play some Battle.net. Win a few games. Notice ego swelling. -Saturday. LAN. Win every Warcraft3 game. On the way home Saturday night realise I may have, in the heat of the moment, said a number of stupid things to people I regard as friends. Feelings of regret surface. -Sunday. Sleep late. Play some Magic the Gathering. See my ass. Ego deflates. Watch Black Knight. Terrible, terrible movie, waste of 20 bucks, wish I could go back in time and kick myself for choosing to watch that. Should have watched Spiderman again. Go home, play some Tribes2 online but PC freezes up twice thanks to new graphics card. Quit in disgust. Watch Cast Away. Excellent movie, I realise afterwards that sometimes life is just about the luck of the draw - just keep going, something might go right someday. Sleep, go to work, write this load of trash, work for 10 minutes, wonder what to do for the rest of the day. Realise I am lucky to have a job where I can sit around on my ass bored out of my skull for most of the day.  peace, out.

      Survivor fans should be shot.  Some fucktards in Brazil have started up a reality TV show about a guy  urlLink chained to six women.  ... I'm having a hard time alternating between loving TV, and hating it. On one hand we have amazing shows like Smallville and Scrubs. On the other hand, we have this mindless fucking  drivel  that is reality TV. Normally I wouldn't give a shit, but when my cable channel of choice boots out Futurama for Big Brother 2, I get a little pissy. Make that very pissy. Urine all over my pants leg pissy. This utter tripe that is reality TV seems to be gaining in popularity. It just keeps getting bigger...and bigger..until the amount of lousy reality TV shows are, at this point in time, pretty much on par with the amount of junky sitcoms out there on the airwaves. And guess what. Will they dump some crapass soap or lousy sitcom for BB2? Oh no! That would be asking  too much ! Nay, instead they'll be airing it in the same timeslot that all my favourite quality shows -what few there are - currently air. Uber-pissy. Thank God for alternate sources of entertainment. If I was one of those poor schlebs without a PC and a net connection... let's just say restrictive pullovers with straps on aren't my bag, baby.  In another oh-so bizarre twist, an argument regarding anorexia sprang up on  urlLink Soap Dish , a forum on Prophecy. Of course, some champion of the female cause, some avatar of raging feminism, goes completely off the deep end about an unrelated issue, like "Men aren't interested in sex" ? What.The.Fuck? No seriously.  What.The. FUCK!  ?  We  aren't interested in  sex ?. Christ lady, what fucking DIMENSION are you from? I won't even say planet. 'Planet' is not enough to convey the utter ridiculousness of such a statement! Sex is the   only   thing we males think about! The only way a guy wouldn't be interested in you as a sex object is if you look like Gwyneth Paltrow in that fat-suit from Shallow Hal! If women were as interested in sex as we guys are, the only thing we'd be doing all day every day, is shag. 24/7. If 15 minutes goes by without a straight guy thinking about porking Liz Hurley or a gay guy dreaming about shafting Brad Pitt (or something along those lines), then there's something seriously wrong with said guy. The difference comes in how some guys  handle  these thoughts. Guys today can repress it pretty well, what with all the pro-feminism crap spouting out of every media-fountain on the planet. Perhaps this fruitcake's rantings about men not interested in sex is merely because she's lousy in the sack, or something, I don't know. All I know that's for sure, as a guy and as a guy that hang's around other guys a lot(coz that's what guys do), is that we think about head  plenty . You wanna know why? Coz it's so fucking hard to  get some , short of paying for it. How are  them  apples tasting?

      Opinions are like assholes...   urlLink ATTYSH , a sort of mix between a sort of daily journal slash rant spot for two guys, Miktar and dislekcia, is proving to be quite a heap of fun.Particularly, whatever 'hot topic' on  urlLink Prophecy  seems to become the daily ammunition for their ravings. Rather like 15minutes, except they thought of it first. Now heck, I respect these 2 guys a whole bunch - a good sense of humour and/or a flair with the written word is a lost art in todays 'Innernet" culture, where being able to type meaningless shit in haxor speak seems to be respected by the rather stupid (and large amount of) people who practice it. I ramble on. Here's the thing. Dislekcia rants about how elitism sucks. How people that rip off other people are being shitheads. How people with strong opinions on a matter , people who consider themselves better than their peers in their debatal subject of choice, are dickwads. Newsflash dis. In that little diatribe, are you not 'ripping off' people yourself? You are, in fact, ripping off people who rip off at people. Catch 22? Vicious circle? Looks like you're no different from the rest of us after all.  Us humans enjoy nothing more than trying to 'one-up' their fellow man. Be it games, at the job, among friends,  everyone  wants to be better at something than someone else. Everyone wants to be an elitist in whatever field they feel is their 'speciality'. It is part of what makes us human. It is part of what ensures our continued evolution. And I believe that everyone has a passion , a field, an area of expertise which sets them aside from the the rest. Dislekcia may not like to admit it, but he's better than average at RTS games than your normal, run-of-the-mill Warcraft3-playing pleb. Miktar denies it , but he has creative talents that most people could only wish for. They are, in a sense, elitists in their fields. Everyone is born with a gift that differentiates us from Joe Public. If this were not the case, we'd probably be a race of Borg-style automatons, all thinking and feeling the same things, all equally adept at whatever it is we do. Robots. Never trying to go 'one better', never trying to BE better, rather, just sticking to the norm, the true, tried and tested formula. Rather like Britney. .end rant.  And now for something completely different.  You know, it's funny how everyone gets their 15 minutes. Their short moment in the spotlight. In todays online culture, this seems more so than usual. I'll take for example , something I found quite funny while surfing the forums yesterday. Someone mentioned my post count, which is around 5000 posts over the space of 2 years or so. It struck me how absolutely meaningless being evaluated as a person due to a number next to your alias, is. Recently I landed in a rather stinky hotbed of piracy related politcal-correctness (read.shit), because some forum-goer had bitched that I, an oh-so-holy forum admin, had been 'fingered' as a warez-hound, pirate-game playing dirty-bird (Stephen King, how you have influenced my mind so.) Instantly everyone forgets that about 80% of everyone else who frequents said forum, is also a bit of a warez-jockey him/herself - whether said material is mp3's, games or divx rips of Spiderman. I was struck by how quickly people will find themselves a scapegoat - how quickly they'll find some poor slob to nail to a cross. I am willing to bet my life savings that the jerk who started this shitfit probably has a warez collection of note. But because I'm a so-called 'admin', I have to be a fucking  cherub ? What the fuck, people? Even us schmucks 'in positions of power', remain merely human! We retain our fallacies, our failures, our Clintonian instincts! We slip up, we make mistakes, we're just like you! Woe betide YOU someday end up in a position like mine and YOU make a fuckup. It's like the whole Dubya debacle. The man is turned into a clown for public amusement, but how quickly people forget that the guy gets results. And Clinton, wow, he was nearly burnt at the stake for somethig as simple as blowing his load on a skanky,  willing interns dress. It takes 2 to tango, folks. I'm glad that Clinton 'got off' (ahah), though it pains me that that situation turned into what it did. Evidence that society today likes nothing more than engaging on long, tiresome and overall entertaining witch hunts? You betcha. I think it was that wack-job Marilyn Manson who said it best. "God is in the TV"  Continuing on, The Life of Brian. Or rather just me. Warcraft3, or rather "Warcrack" as I like to call it (how utterly goddamn original), continues to be a bucketload of good fun. I've even managed to win a few games. One thing I noticed is how some players on Battle.Net wil take it so very hard if they lose. Ties in quite nicely with the whole 'elitism in music' thing. People don't like to lose. Even if they are innately crap at something, they'll nonetheless keep bashing at it UNTIL, through sheer cheapness alone, they somehow come up with a trump card. I played a 2vs2 with 3 other guys I didn't know. One was a pretty high ranking ZA player. Me and a rather 'lousy' player teamed for the first game. By virtue of me playing a pretty decent (imo) team game, I rescued my teamie from impending disaster twice, expanded, teched up, and destroyed one player virtually single handedly. Finally, with some backup from my new best friend, we combined and took out the 'good guy' (who wasn't that good, really. just another cheap rusher.). Of course a rematch was cried. Second time round they did the cheesiest thing possible by doubling-up and going straight for my partner and eliminating him. I suppose we made a tactical mistake. We should have known that the two 'good' players would be pissed and rush the weaker of us. I mean, what can you really expect from 'gosu' WC3 players? Honour? Not fucking likely. I guess when it comes down to it, if you 2vs2, play with players who you KNOW will be a fun game, not just another bunch of cheap rushers. It's kind of sad that a game like WC3, which was supposed to BREAK the emphasis on rushing that came with Starcraft, emphasizes rushing more than ever. Already there are debates about the effectiveness of creeping vs plain old fashioned rushing. Now, I may not be any good at WC3, but I LOVE the dynamic of creeping, trying to level up your hero , and doing hit run tactics. I love it when a game goes all the way to the late stages. I DETEST it when you hardly ever get a chance to 'play' with the higher tier units. That just feels like a sell out to me.  peace, out

      On Britney and general shitness. There's been a recent  urlLink shitfest  on  urlLink Prophecy  regarding Britney Spears. I know, I don't get it either.  Everyone  knows her music is a farce, even her fans for sweet fucking Mary-Lou Stevenson's sake. But, as usual, some folks just aren't willing to let the honest-to-god FACT that she can't sing worth shit hinder their views that , yes, Ms. Spears is a wonderfully fucking talented little tart. You know, you hit a point where you just stop trying to hammer some sense into peoples' heads. I'm not saying everyone should go listen to Slipknot. I just wish with all my heart and what's left of my soul, that people would begin to think for themselves , that they'd make up their own opinions instead of buying into all the hype and peer-ravings. It's like the whole Linux vs Windows thing (another topic that just won't fucking die). People who never even  used  Linux will go on and on about how absolutely goddamn good it is, stable fast, etc etc... the same shit we 'Windoze Lusers' have heard a million times before. Christ people, could you think  outside  the box for a second? If Linux does what YOU want it to do for you , then yippee-ki-yay, good for you. But casually dismissing hundreds of thousands of Windows users as 'idiots' for using an OS that meets their needs and satisfies their desires , is just plain stupid, in the stupidest fucking way possible. I'll tell you a little secret. Linux users secretly all have penis envy. Big American Penis envy. And to all those people bitching about blue screens as an excuse to move over to Linux. There's a NEW version of Windows out! Yes, it's amazing! It's called WindowsXP! In fact, you probably missed the last version of the Windows OS that came out as well. Windows 2000. I've been using it for a year now and have YET to experience this dreaded BSOD on Win2K. I mean , what the fuck, 98SE is going on 4 years old now. Do you see Linux users out there running 4 year old versions of their OS? No? Then bitching about 98's stability today is a moot point. Times have changed. You have to move with them.

      Well, my first foray into the wonderful world of blogging was met with Blogger chewing up and spitting out my carefully thought up intro. Jinkies. So here is the new, un-improved intro. Welcome to fifteenminutes.What can you expect? I guess the usual - random ramblings by someone with an average intellect and too much spare time surfing the net during office hours. A regular fucking Siegried and Roy extravaganza. Or something. If anything said here offends, or does not meet your political/moral/religious/whatever the fuck viewpoint, remember these words.

      Childhood Nostalgia.  Todays blog is going to be a short one. Remember your childhood? If you're anything like me, it was probably spent with lego, or action figures (Masters of the Universe in my case), and which young lad would be caught dead without a Lone Wolf book? Well, thanks to Bishop, I am now reliving those days playing the Lone Wolf gamebooks. So far I've gone through three in the space of an afternoon, and  boy  do they bring back memories! Such brilliant, carefree memories...  No, he didn't give me his collection of paperbacks (I wish!). Rather, he pointed me to  urlLink this site.  The Aon Project. Joe Dever has given these guys permission to redo each and every Lone Wolf book, from 1 to 12 (these I consider the classics - the ones thereafter are not available for free download unfortunately), in HTML format. Not only is this much,  much  easier (thumbing from page 3 to page 347 every few moments could result in quite a few papercuts, believe me), but the site includes an amazing utility called Statskeeper that saves your progress. It even includes a random number generator. The Aon project makes playing Lone Wolf even more fun, painless and immensely rewarding. All the books are downloadable, they include art, maps and so on.  I can't help but babble incoherently on and on about it, but let me bow out with this - if you're a Lone Wolf fan, and want to give the Kai/Magnakai sagas a bash again, check it out. If you HAVEN'T yet experienced the world of Lone Wolf... what the hell is wrong with you?  Go read it now! What are you still doing here?  Go!

      Writers Block  To think, yesterday I had at least 2 promising rants mucking around in my brain, and today they've gone, skipped across the border merrily into obfuscation. Or something. So instead, I shall blather on about my meaningless life. It was a long weekend for me. Yesterday was supposed to have been off. It was supposed to have been spent drenching myself in cinema-marathon bliss. Instead, I was drafted into manual labour.  Manual labour , ffs! The humanity. So today I am sunburnt, grumpy, have sore back muscles and I just want to go home and watch Scrubs, instead of trying to think up creative ways to waste time until 5 o clock. And to think, this is how I spend my life, trying to KILL time. It's so precious, and yet so many of us don't realise that. So, I have made up my mind. Yes, just now as I was typing this. In about a year's time, I am going to quit my job and persue further , full-time education. I'll save up, pay off my debts (car, loan and a few others). And if it means I have to live on the good graces of others like my folks again, so be it. You only get one shot at life, and you should spend it doing something you enjoy instead of wasting it by killing time. Journalism degree, here I come...

      Of Long weekends, and Skippage part deux.  Skipped yesterdays blog because I was strongarmed into attending a rather lame and horribly dull workshop by Human Resources. For those who are intrested, it was a presentation on Performance Management. Also known as 'How We, The Company, Will Shag You Up The Ass And Convince You That It's Actually Quite A Bit Of Fun. No Really.' Anyone working in a reasonably large company will no doubt be familiar with performance apparaisals. Ie, when your boss takes you aside and tells you how crap you are at your job and how you don't, in fact, deserve a raise. What struck me as a bit funny was how the presenter used charts and shit to show that most employees were dead average, and just did their job. Hello? That's what you PAY us to do - our jobs. Nothing more, nothing less. Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for enjoying your job, getting some sense of satisfaction out of it. But in the end, it  IS  merely a job. Very, very few of us get the opportunity to really be involved in a job that we are passionate about. While I like my job (Systems Analyst/Support), it's far from my dream job ( which is probably writing, or working as a journalist, specifically one in the IT and/or PC/console gaming industry). I do it for the money. As such, the only thing that's going to motivate me is money. Period. And if companies are going to liken 100% effort as merely 'average', and use this excuse NOT to give us more oney, how can they expect carrer-workers to 'give that little bit extra'? It's like a vicious cycle : Employer demands 115%, but only pays if workers work harder. Workers will work harder, but only if employer pays. It's almost like the old cowboys flicks, we have two guys on the street, each waiting for the other to draw his gun. Difference is,  neither  party IS willing to bite the bullet and draw first.  Anyhoo, I have this coming Monday off, so expect yet MORE skippage then. Bah, why am I making excuses, I'm sure the few of you who bother to read this trash wouldn't give a flying fuck at a rolling donut if this blog just died tomorrow. So the hell with you.  :D

      What makes a true CRPG?  Over at  urlLink the Prophecy forums , a debate rages over whether diablo2 is an RPG or not, as compared to Neverwinter Nights. Vul_kahn's arguments are that both feature you bashing things to level up so you can bash more things. This is a simplified version of his argument, but essentially he IS correct. The single-player campaign of 'Nights IS pretty much just a hack and slash with some decent dialogue and plot intrigue thrown in. However, to define a true RPG, you have to go deeper, you have to look at the roots of Pen and Paper Roleplaying. A P&P RPG game consists not merely of a bunch of players hacking things. It includes two very vital elements. The tools to CREATE an adventure, and someone (The Dungeon Master) to actually run the game. When you play Diablo2 or 'Nights single, one key element, the human DM, is removed. No longer do players have the freedom of choice in a P&P RPG, because strict rules prevent you from doing so. The reason? Simple - PC's aren't human. They have no intelligence. They cannot predict or react to human 'wackiness'. If you kill a critical NPC, the game either 'breaks', or the town guard kills you, or even worse, the NPC is 'invulnerable' (pfft). And THAT isn't roleplaying. Roleplaying means being able to do exactly what you want, and bugger the consequences. Not even 'Nights' single player is, in that regard, a true RPG. Neither is Baldurs Gate, or even Planescape Torment. However, Nights has one thing up it's sleeve that Diablo doesn't. In multiplayer, you CAN have a Dungeon Master! And INSTANTLY, 'Nights becomes a lot more than merely a hack and slash. It becomes a true CRPG, the first of it's kind, ever. FM's can possess creatures and NPC's and 'speak through them' or even guide their actions. DM's can create NPC's and monsters out of the air... almost anything that you can do in a P&P RPG, can be done in 'Nights. Factor in 'Nights' content creation, a toolset the likes of which have not been seen before, and I can comfortably say tha tNeverwinter Nights IS the first , true translation of Pen and Paper Roleplaying, to PC. Now if only more people would actually LEARN to play as the DM...

      Dreaded continuity...  In keeping with todays blog(lower down), I propose that society can be split up into 5 groups. 1)Those who cannot 'see the line', but stick to the side of good, right and sanity. This is ye average working class pleb. 2)Those who cannot 'see the line', and remain on the side of wrong, evil and insanity. Violent criminals, gangbangers and the like. 3)Those who see the line, and stick to the side of good, right and sanity. I guess these'd be like the true blue cops, those who are in it for the love, not the money. I've always wanted to be a cop, or a fireman, or a doctor. Perhaps it's because I can see what's on the other side of the line and want to get as far away from it as possible. Perhaps because the further away I can get, the less alluring it would be... 4)Those who see the line yet stray over to the 'dark' side. Psychopaths, serial killers, loonies, basketcases etc.  5)Lastly, you get the occasional few who see the line and like walking down it, like a trapeze artist on a tightrope. I've known a few people like this. Scary stuff, they never quite plunge all the way into insanity, but they're never truly completely sane either. Some psychologists/analysts/etc would argue that psychopaths do not know that what they are doing is wrong. I would disagree. They know. It's just that they  enjoy it , nonetheless.

      12'O Clock, and all's well...  About a hundred years ago or so (give or take a few decades), in Victorian England, the Bobbies would walk around at night, and every hour they'd intone something like "Twelve O Clock, and all's well". Even though All was  not  in fact, well. He'd walk past a house bellowing that all was right with the world, and a few short feet away, behind some brickwork, some 'gentlemen' would be beating his wife or molesting his kids or something. One thing I've noticed regarding humanity. Most of us believe that ignorance is bliss. That if we hear and see no evil, then there must be no evil. Some would say that humanity is inherently good and that real, true evil does not exist, merely that some people have 'issues', or 'problems'. Nuts to that, I say. Real evil exists. Oh yes. I know it for a  fact . I know it exists,  because I can feel it in me sometimes - I choose not to ignore it, I choose to see it, to hear it. It's there, in me, struggling to escape and wreak havoc upon the world. I wonder what it would be like to pick up a knife and start hunting people like cattle. I can almost smell and taste the excitement of being feared, the exhiliration of seeing my alias in the papers, the glee of knowing that society both loves and fears this monster it has created. I wonder what it would be like to live a life as a serial killer, and I understand  why  serial killers exist. Many people do not, they blind themselves to the inner desire for a power over others - not some stupid, useless pseudo-power like, say, being someone's boss, but rather the true power of being willing to remorselessly take a life merely for the sake of it. And then I realise the sheer insanity of it, and that insanity  is  evil, not merely a 'condition'. It is pure, distilled hate, anger, malice, call it what you will. But it's not right, and it does not deserve to exist. It's for this reason that I advocate that people getting off murder charges on pleas of insanity, should not be getting free medical help and a 5 year sentence. They need to be put down, like a rabid dog. Because like a rabid dog, once a person realises he can do something that's just plain wrong   and get away with it , he  will  do it again. I am fortunate that I can see what's on the other side of the line, many choose not to. I am also fortunate that I can SEE the line itself, and choose not to cross it. I doubt I ever will, but I know, now, that if I ever do, someone would have to take me the fuck out, because I know, if I ever give into the rage, if I ever blissfully sink into it, I will never truly surface from again.

      Be Accountable.  Accountability. An interesting concept, and one that people today take no interest in adopting. Well, most people. Being accountable means being willing to take the blame if things go wrong, and being there when things go right. Oddly enough though, it seems few people are willing to be held accountable in this day and age. At least, unless it's part of the job description. It's nigh  impossible  to find someone who will willingly be held accountable for something, voluntarily. Where am I going with this, you may ask? Well, this weekend saw a certain LAN take place, a LAN where the biggest grouping of gamers in our fair little town ever, occured. 35 people fragging it out in Counterstrike and Warcraft with a little Quake3 and Renegade thrown in for good measure. The surprising twist - the organiser didn't really organise. Granted, securing a venue and a smattering of networking equipment was step 1, but that alone was not enough. I had informed the organiser of my intent to assist where possible, and in the end I ended up doing a hell of a lot more than I thought I would have to do. I organised a switch when it became obvious that the 2 hubs were not enough  and  just too damn slow (props to Frans from  urlLink Logical Networks  for the loan unit!). I organised the Warcraft  and  the Counterstrike tournaments (I was only supposed to do the Warcraft tourney, but it became painfully obvious to me that the guy I was depending on to set up the dedicated servers , to take scores etc etc hadn't done his job - fortunately another came through in the end and set up the dedicated server and helped immensely with the administration of the Counterstrike tournament - thanks  urlLink Kevin! ), I spent hours checking that everyone had registered and organising teams for those who hadnt managed to get themslves set up into 5 man CS teams and 2-man Warcraft3 teams, I walked around checking that there was no cheating going on..and so on. In the end, my entire Saturday was spent on my feet trying to keep people happy. I also donated around 15+ games, some of them pretty new, all in mint condition. What did I get out of this? I got a little satisfaction. Mostly, I got nothing out of it - a few words of thanks from certain valued people. That's it. I don't feel I need to have gotten anything out of it. As long as I raised the bar for lanning in this little backwater city. Sadly though, this is not the first such LAN I've had to carry through. I don't want to sound like an egotistical jerk, but it seems I am one of  very  few people here willing to take the ball and run with it. And I too would like to, one day, just sit down at a LAN and play - but I know that if I don't pitch in, no-one else will. And that pisses me off - it's hard fuckin work keeping a medium to large sized lan from devolving into utter chaos, it needs a dedicated group of people willing to make sacrifices for the good of the gaming community, it needs a bunch of people like Mayhem in SA, and this is what I want AGN to be, one day. But when I look at AGN and see that , out of the 12 or so members, only 3 people have so far really tried to help in even  small  ways, I realise that gamers in Windhoek just don't give a shit about gaming.  Despite this, I will continue to try. Maybe, some day, some of the gamers here will actually see the effort that some of us put into making lan's they come to enjoyable. Maybe they will be inspired to help out or even better organise their own large-scale events. Maybe one day big-lan gaming will be elevated to the same level that it is in South Africa and further abroad. But only if people are willing to Be Accountable.

      Cheaters ALWAYS prosper.  For the last few weeks/months I've been playing a cute little web-based textual strategy game called  urlLink Promisance . At first , it was fun, everyone played fairly and empires rose and fell like the tides. But I play it no longer. Recently, a group going by the name of Chaos rose and took up all the top 20 odd slots. And the only explanation would be cheating. By registering numerous 'empires' per person, they could use their bogus empires to send their 'real' empire shipments of weapons, money and food. It's blatant cheating. And nothing is being done about it, because it's hard to prove - merely sign up your 'feeder' empires using a bogus email addy and you can't be touched. Whoever thought up that stupid adage 'Cheaters never prosper' must have been living on cloud fucking 9 or something. This is the REAL world! Cheaters ALWAYS prosper! The wallhack using Counterstrike punk ALWAYS wins, and with the latest OGC hack not much can be done to prove anything. How about a real-life example? Second hand car salesmen. Oh yes, cheaters extroardinaire, filling radiators with oil and using straw to silence knocks. 3 weeks after buying the car , you find out that the thing is a lemon, and you can't do jack shit about it. Hell even big business is in on the cheating game. I've bought a few things from this 'Verimark' company (eventually learning my lesson) , the one with all the infomercials on TV, and 9 out of 10 times the stuff is sheer, utter junk incapable of coming CLOSE to fulfilling all those promises stated on the googlebox. They all come with money back guarantees, but just TRY and send something back to them via the mail... you never hear from them, and if you try and phone them they claim they never received the item or, better yet, they received the item AFTER it's 14-day money-back guarantee expired. Hello? Do these fuckwits honestly expect the postal system to deliver an item to them in less than 14 days?!!?  If I had my way I'd line up all the Promisance cheaters, Counterstrike script kiddies, Warcraft 3 maphackers, used car salesmen, Verimark employees and televangelists, and break each and every fucking one of their kneecaps with a baseball bat. I mean, what the  fuck  is wrong with people?! Cheating is wrong! Ripping off your fellow man is wrong! Didn't your parents teach you ANYTHING?!? Sometimes have so little faith in the human race...

      I Hate My Chair  My office chair is the worst. At first, it looked comfy. It has armrests and wheels and it's one of those long backed jobbies that make you go 'ooh, nice chair' That impression dissappears quickly once you actually SIT in the damn thing. First of all the backrest angle is not adjustable, and I find that it leans back too much, forcing me to sit bolt upright with my back not actually touching the back rest. Hello stupid chair designers? They call it a back rest for a bloody reason! But perhaps the single most annoying thing about this chair is the material. It's like kevlar or something. You slip around in it like a greased eel in an oil slick. Nothing wants to stay put. Personally I prefer those chairs with a 'carpet' style finish since my butt isn't constantly trying to wriggle out of said chairs.  Come 3PM every day it's the same, I'm squirming and grunting and trying my level best to get comfortable, but to no avail. So there you have it folks, concrete proof why I'm such a grumpy sod. Damn chair.

      You damn person!  You've probably been on the giving or receiving end of an insult going along the lines of something like this : "You fag/homo!" "You nigger/kaffir!" "You whitebread/redneck" "Redksin!" "Bloody woman!" etcetera.  I can understand insults like "You dumb asshole" etcetera, but what's the point of calling someone something they clearly  are ? Like, should I take offense for someone calling me a fat white boy? I suppose I would, but WHY? I  am  a fat white boy. It would be like someone blikseming (beating up) someone else for saying "You damn human being you!". Following this train of thought - would a black man take offense for being called a 'nigger'? Damn straight. But why? 'Nigger' is derived from 'Nigerian',  Nigeria being where 90% of the slaves came from that make up todays US black population. So, in effect, calling an American black person a 'nigger' is akin to calling him a Nigerian. Or, for that matter, an African American. There is no difference. Saying "Hi there African American person" theoretically is no different to saying "Hey nigger."  Words, or names, can evolve and be twisted to mean something they aren't meant to. It's quite damned ridiculous. In fact, that so many of our African black compadres still get all pissy at any mention of the word 'kaffir' (derived from the latin Cafur, which means 'resident of Africa' or somesuch) indicates that they all very much suffer from massive inferiority complexes or something. People call me 'soutie' (Englishman) or 'rooinek' (Redneck) regularly, and you don't see me taking them to court about it. And yet, here in Southern Africa we've recently seen a number of cases where black people have taken white people to court for mistakenly uttering the K-word. I call this 'Mankind's great capacity to label absolutely anything' - it is our ability to make absolutely  anything seem bad by merely assosciating the name/label with a negative quality. We could really do without it.

      Double postage and happiness. Another double post day. Whoop de doo.  The reason for this second bit of meandering literary tripe,is simple really. Happiness. Contentment. And what causes it?  I was walking back to work today after getting some takeout for lunch, and the simplest thing - the lazy sun caressing my face as I strolled along - caused a feeling of contentment, a happiness to merely be  alive , a feeling I am (and I think many of us are) quite unused to. Walking back to the office, I remembered the real golden days of my youth. Junior high, Friday afternoons, a pocket full of small change and a world of arcades to pay homage to. Myself and a friend would routinely spend our afternoons off from school just walking around town, between arcades and shopping malls and book and toy stores. Just the two of us, and three hours of sheer bliss. Not a care in the world. No worries about being alone, about money, no worries about what had to be done tomorrow. We'd walk slowly down our town's main street, revelling in the loving dull-heat of a winter afternoon's sun. We'd watch cars and people going by just for the hell of it. We'd slake our thirst with an ice cold Coke - and in that  moment , that Coke was our whole world..and that world was perfect. Laughter and smiles and jokes came so easily then. Ever since, my favourite times of the year have been Friday afternoons in August. Here in my home town, August afternoons are just perfect. They seem to hold so much promise, they call to you to enjoy the contrast between the lingering chill of winter and the welcoming warmth of the coming spring, they whisper temptations to skip work, lie back, and just contentedly  be .  The late winter afternoons of the late eighties were the best of the bunch - no worries about peer pressure and girls yet, and school was simple and easy. What happened to those days? I'll tell you what happened. 1)We stopped caring about the  moment . 2)We started working, and Friday afternoons were lost forever to the corporate money-making slave-machine that is capitalism.  Today, all grown up, scarcely a minute goes by without a fear of some future event, without worrying about what's going to happen next. There is constant apprehension about when we have to meet a deadline, or when we are supposed to catch that show on TV.  When young, time was our friend. We knew how to enjoy our spare time, how to have real fun with the time we had. Today, it is our enemy. Even when playing a computer or video game we are constantly worrying about some future detail. Like, when should we log off to get some sleep. Or when you have to halt your game of Warcraft 3 in order to meet up with someone, somewhere, sometime. Or when we have to check our mail , check up on the forums, check up on our IRC contacts, etc etc.  Add to that just how  little  spare time we have now compared to then, and it seems futile to even try and enjoy ourselves.   Our adult lives are filled to the brim with responsibility to others, to friends, to family, to a job. We have lost the capability of prioritising a responsibility to ourselves. Gone are the days of just saying to your best bud, "Whaddaya wanna do this afternoon", and him saying "I dunno, let's go play Golden Axe." Not being able to live in the now anymore is a real, personal and profound tragedy. I really miss those days.

      Say....Don't Say!  I am tired of the 'speak no evil' attitude being propogated by certain individuals on Prophecy. Specifically, I am referring to the recent MapHack doing the rounds on Battle.Net/Warcraft3. The argument(s) being thrown my way indicate that "you don't play a lot of ladder so stfu!". Personally, I find that a rather stupid, childish and downright "I got a bigger wingwong than you" attitude. So, Mr "Speak no evil" : merely because I play Warcraft 3 casually instead of professionally, I am supposed to sit there, eat humble pie, and say   nothing   when some punk uses a maphack against me? What exactly is your problem? Are you scared that, by me voicing my opinion, I may 'scare' away a potential Warcraft3 community in our fair section of the world? Newsflash. They WILL hear about this elsewhere. Me shutting my piehole certainly isn't going to change things. As for my views that perhaps it would be wiser to lay off playing online until a patch arrives, it is merely that, my opinion. I am sure other people can actually make up their own minds. In fact, I am sick to fucking  death  of the train of thought doing the rounds on the PH Forums , that people are not allowed to air their views or opinions anymore. There's an ideal out there that helped eradicate this kind of oppression : It's called freedom of fucking speech! It's what the free world is based on you fucking dimwits! It's ridiculous - I get flamed by the webmaster for shitting on some n00b about said n00b dragging up and reflogging an already-dead horse, I get flamed for pointing out the obvious about huntresses being fucked (Dis must be the only guy on the web that thinks otherwise), I get crapped on for innocently making a small statement regarding the maphack, I get blamed for standing up to some female who comes in with a PMS streak a mile-wide and the single motive to flame every male on the forums because we are being 'sexist' (it's not alright for us to poke fun at anorexics, but it's okay for her to make jokes about penis size and obesity?). And then said new member chickens out and leaves the PH community, and fingers get pointed at me. I am  THIS  fucking close to giving the whole PH community the proverbial finger. Never, while there, have I denied someone the right to express their views, no matter how ridiculous. Sure I've judged, sure I've flamed, but not  once  have I accused them of being wrong for AIRING their views! Or denied them their right to speak out! It's infinitely worse(and easier) to just shut the fuck up and ignore a problem, than to say something about it and maybe create some awareness. All I have to say to those propogating the notion that perhaps it's better to say nothing, is this old cliche : "Ignorance is bliss".  The more I think about it, the more I get the feeling that it's a case of 'because you said it, we will fight you on it". Maphacking  is  a serious problem. Blizzard  themselves  are in an uproar about it. With that in mind, to casually dismiss it as 'not that serious' and flame me for advocating a no-play policy until a patch is released is really.fucking.stupid.

      Africa sucks. So yesterday my sisters boyfriend gets robbed at gunpoint at an ATM. The same day armed robbers hold up a branch as well. Day before that my sister is in  court  to testify, and in an unrelated case, while she's there a prisoner escapes, lifts a cop's gun and almost blows away said cop point blank - luckily guns are unloaded in the courthouse. The guy still managed to escape the courthouse - the authorities gave chase, he got hold of ANOTHER firearm somehow and killed a polic officer that was trying to apprehend him. Sometime later the guy gave himself in. Why didnt the cops drop the swine? He's a copkiller ffs! I'll tell you why. Because he's the  son  of a parliament member... Only in Africa. What else sucks about living in this shit hole. Let's see. Tax is high, salaries are low, real-estate is going through the roof, trying to get the latest PC games is an excercise in futility, internet access is slow and costs an arm and a leg... I'm tellin ya, those living in the first world really don't know how good they've got it.

      Desire is bred from yourself. Nothing overly astounding in that comment, but one I feel should be aired nonetheless. A desire for something is only really created by yourself. Sure many of us will blame pop culture, peer pressure, the media, advertsing - whatever. Hell, I am usually the first to bitch about how marketing sells things these days based largely on fiction rather than the actual,real merits of said products. In the old days, products sold themselves. Today, brand consciousness and flat-out lying does. However, last night I was looking through a friend's Magic:The Gathering collection : a collection he is selling off now since he needs the money pretty badly, and I'll tell you this much - I wanted those cards. Not because of marketing , not because they're good cards, not even because they're valuable to the right person. Rather, I wanted those cards because I like Magic:The Gathering. Sure, I could spend that money instead on the newer, more powerful cards. But I really, really  desired  having another Shivan Dragon. Perhaps because Shivan Dragons are pretty good and exceedingly rare, but more likely just because  it's cool . Maybe it was peer pressure that helped create the desire to own it - other Magic players really go 'WOW!' when they find out you own 4 Wrath of God's, for example. Maybe effective marketing made me want it - The WOTC 7th Ed ad-campaign really helped make Serras Angels popular again even though newer decks usually slaughter them. When you come down to it, an expensive, rare card like Shivan Dragon or Serras Angel is nowhere near as good as some dirt cheap uncommons (or even commons like Terminate). Nonetheless it has a 'cool' factor all it's own. It's hard to explain. Moral of this ridiculous tirade? Sometimes it's pretty pointless trying to blame someone else for making you want something. Once you want it, it's game over, and you can only really blame yourself for wanting it. --- Props to Miktar over at ATTYSH for inspiring todays blog.

      Bringing teh suck since 1977...  I am a really, really crap gamer.  I've always subconsciously known this, but it only really came to me last night playing Warcraft 3 on USEast. I always used to joke about being crap, but it has gone from being a joke to plain honest to God plain fact. Hell, i play in a clan dedicated to 'unl337n3ss', but at least 90% of said clan members are average to above average in their game of choice, whether that be Counterstrike or Tribes2 or whatever... I'll tell you why I am the worst kind of crap gamer. I am one who does not learn. One who does not get  better  with experience. I merely stay the same. It's pretty liberating to realise it. for example, on USEAST last night, Out of , I dunno, around 9 games, I lost 8. (1v1's). Against other guys with rating 2 or 3 (which is maybe just higher than 'pond-scum') I also pretty much cost me and my ally AL]Varlet the 5 or so 2V2's we played, either by showing up too late to assist, or doing dumb strategies, etc. I think we won one, but the sheer number of losses has resulted in me remembering almost nowt of that game. I vaguely remember building quite a few Crypt Fiends though.  I am so bad it's rare. Virtually  every  gamer gets better at a game the more they play. It's basic human nature to adapt to something. Not me. It's like I operate at 46.9%  all the time , no matter what. Like I said in yesterdays blog, I used to be pretty good at Quake2 - but I never got  better , I was always merely 'good', no matter how much I played and practiced. I guess I could blame many things - the fact that I wear glasses could be a contributing factor (they tend to induce a kind of tunnel vision impairing your peripheral sight which is vital in WC3...), the fact that I had to switch from playing pilot-style mouse to 'proper-style' mouse when I bought Ultima 9 (you couldn't invert the mouse in U9, and I had to adapt to playing 'real' style - ever since my performance in FPS games has suffered dramatically) could also be blamed. But in the end, I can only blame myself and my inflexibility. It sucks though, because I  want  to be good at a game again - I miss the days of Quake2 where people around town (other gamers) would occasionally utter things like 'kHayne is a whore with the SuperShotgun'. I don't get that no more. I try not to let it bother me too much, but it nonetheless does.  I quote the inestimable Linkin Park in closing : "I tried so hard, and got so far. In the end, it doesn't even matter"

      'Avergeness' No, I'm not talking about average looking, or average intellect. Rather, a state of mind. Today I am feeling 'average'. There are no apprehensions, no real desires, no pressure placed on myself by myself to do something. I just am. I wouldn't say that I am at peace, or anything even remotely profound like that. Just merely content. Not abundantly joyous, but neither am I downright depressed and angsty (which is the usual.). Can't say I mind it. Interesting read on  urlLink The Zone  over at BBC. Like dislekcia says on the Prophecy forums, it's a case of 'pop culture telling us something we already know'. Be that as it may, it's interesting nonetheless. I'm sure every gamer has experienced a moment when suddenly everything goes right. I call it going into 'The Groove'. On very rare occasions I can go into 'The Groove' in Counterstrike. I used to be able to go into 'The Groove' almost at will in Quake2 - oddly enough though it never seemed to happen for me in Quake3. Perhaps Quake3's pace was just wrong - whatever the case, there were often times in Quake2 where I would pull off MA rail shots and rocket hits, circle strafe with the best of them and generally be a badass mofo. Some may argue that it was merely the caliber of players I played against back then, but I tend to think otherwise. I could instantly 'feel' it, it was immediately recognizable - suddenly the world seems to go crystal clear and your reactions and accuracy just go through the roof. Quake2 used to do it to me all the time, Quake3 never really has.  Most often, when I went into the groove it was because I was winning. It was not The Groove that caused me to win - nay, it was winning that caused The Groove. It's hard to explain, but I think it's something to do with the confidence granted by repeat wins combining with the sudden loss of all thoughts of trying to outsmart or outmaneaver your opponent(s). Suddenly it becomes completely natural - as if it's something you do all day every day. A helluva feeling. I miss it. I blame overly complex games today. There are too many thoughts going through your brain with you trying to remember which button changes to which weapon and what hotkey is used to build a Town Hall. I was good at Quake2 because all I needed to play was the mouse , the scroll wheel to change weapons, and the WASD keys for movement. But Quake3 became about being able to switch between Rail and Rocket quickly, which weapon to use in which situation, where the spawnable items were and when they'd spawn etc etc. It became an information overload and I was suddenly THINKING instead of GAMING - depriving the natural killer instinct of space to breath. What I'd like to see in future and what I think is vitally important for any future multiplayer games, is a return to simplicity of control and play, a return to an emphasis on base skill rather than strategy. Once this happens, we may see games where we go into The Zone more frequently, and personally I think that makes for much more engaging multiplay, whether playing or spectating.

      Warcrack3 Damn this game. Damn it all too hell. Few games come along that fill a person with such a desire, 24/7, to play it. It is the software version of crack.  And with desire comes passion. Passion which tend to create  urlLink arguments.  My argument being Huntresses are overpowered. Horribly so. It seems every 'good' player on the net uses mass huntresses. I've been playing on USEast for about two or three weeks, and EVERY SINGLE LOSS has been to mass huntresses. I doubt this is because the good players play Night Elf. Surely not ALL the good players prefer NE? That is statistically impossible...UNLESS...Night Elves have an ace up their sleeves. Ie Huntress. Anyhoo, rantings on game imbalances aside (Blizzard is reportedly working on the problem - Night Elves have created much of the same issues that existed with Mutalisks in Starcraft), it's weekend again. Can you beleive it. Time for drinking, sleeping, and playing more WC3. It's hard to be pissy and remain in a black mood when it's a Friday afternoon and 45 minutes left before the weekend begins. Have a good one folks.

      Skippage. Skipped yesterday's blog. It completely slipped my mind. Egads. Probably because I went home early from work, being ill and all. Feeling sick sucks. Bought a 40X CDRW and a 40gig hard drive. It's fun to burn a CD in 3 minutes. :D --- Todays rant regards  urlLink dissing of scrubs . Thanks to PennyArcade, I happened upon quite an enlightening article regarding 'Playing to win'. Which is admirable and all. But what struck me is just how  trite  and mocking the article's author was concerning us 'scrubs'. Now, I'm not going to go into the ethics of pro vs amateur gaming and all that shit. What I  am  going to bitch about is retards who diss those of us who fork out our hard earned dollars to buy games. You think it's the pro-gamers who keep the gaming-industry running? Don't make me laugh. They buy maybe a single game every year, and play that and only that. 24/7. Not only that, but they win the tournaments and take the prize money which coincidentally is made up of the entrance fees we scrubs pay to perhaps have a shot at competing, or even merely spectating. We SCRUBS pay their salaries, we SCRUBS buy the games that they play. If we were ALL pro's, if we ALL played to win, do you think there'd be a gaming industry at all? Think about it. THEN diss me for being a scrub you elitist pricks.

      Celebrities : good for fish food...  Thought struck me yesterday when I heard Ferdie of Big Brother ZA fame had released his own cd, "Wakka wakka". How can this tool get so famous? The guys has virtually zero discernable talent or skill whatsoever. I mean he cant sing worth a shit for one, and he releases his own CD? It'll probably sell like hotcakes too.  What the hell is so great about celebs anyway? What do they contribute to society? Even a skilled actor like, say, Harrison Ford is less deserving of our admiration than the guy who invented the flip top toilet lid, for crying out loud! Even a normal schmo handling a nine to five job has more in the way of real skill and has to rely more on intelligence etc to get his job done, than, say, Sarah Michelle Gellar. Sure she may work hard putting in 4 hour shifts every 3rd day at the set , but come on, she reads a few lines and jumps around in a catsuit, and the world thinks she's like , Jesus Christ or something. But some poor slob programmer sitting in a basement churning out software that  runs  an  entire  corporation, he gets all the recognition of a cockroach. I mean who knows the name of the guy who invented the the microwave oven, or the guy who invented the air conditioner, or the guy who discovered quantum mechanics? Modern inventors and geniuses get no deserving respect. Everyone knows Einstein,Newton and Edison, for example. But who can name the guys who mapped the human genome first, for example? A monumental discovery, one akin to the invention of the lightbulb, and yet seemingly no more important in this day and age than Britneys latest breast enlargement rumour.  How many kids today want to be scientists and doctors compared to kids who want to be actors or pop stars? I think, if the question was posed to the kids of today, we'd see a worrying figure. Which illustrates my point - this world has something fundamentally flawed with it, if it values human  ego  over human ingenuity.

      Worfaire : Strike one...  Well, the GLSA/WCG ZA National finals, aka  urlLink Worfaire , is open for business again, starting 4th October. I had the fortune of attending a Worfaire event in 2000, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of said event - the sponsored machines were groovy, the massive spectator screens rocked - I enjoyed it all immensely. Earlier this year though, GLSA hosted the Worfaire preliminaries. Normally Worfaire is all about the competitive play, but in the prelims they decided to host a BYOC LAN as well. And boy, was it a lemon (reportedly). Middle of winter, no heating, no carpeting, frequent network problems - they all conspired to create the biggest disappointment in GLSA's esteemed (thus far) history. Many people were pissed. And it looks like their cockup has returned to bite them in the ass. GLSA intended to have the first 1000+ man LAN in the southern hemisphere, in an attempt to beat Oz. Sadly, thanks to the 'orrid prelims, only about 100 gamers signed up for the BYOC lan, as opposed to the 600+ they needed. Royal mess. Strike one. I heard a saying once. "Everyone is entitled to 3 strikes". This is GLSA's first strike. However, I'm wondering if it may also be their last? Life is cruel, and people have little compassion - our most base instinct, one each of us obeys compunctually, is greed. We want it all. Is that a bad thing? Greed  runs  the world, capitalism is built on it, and ever increasing in quality goods and services is a result of greed trying to satisfy greed. It may not make the world a better place idealogically, but it does work. Better than Communism anyway. And this is what the GLSA has to embrace now in order to save it's reputation and prevent "jumping the shark" (I love that phrase...). Trying to persuade gamers that it's their  duty  to fork over the 100 or so bucks to play in what may be a repeat of 'The Fridge' (what the dreaded prelim has come to be known)  will just not work. Because no matter what, greed wins out over patriotism every time. Time to get that marketing machine rolling, GLSA.

      Dead.Tired.  Some days, it feels as if you haven't slept for a month. Today, is one of those days. I very nearly fell asleep at my desk over lunch. The only thing on my mind right now is going home and sleeping for a year. Sleep. What a waste of time. Imagine what one could accomplish if sleep was unnecessarry.  I could study. Teach myself something. I could actually finish Neverwinter Nights. I could play online, and spend an hour or two each night talking crap on IRC. Watch late night TV. I could devote more time to my so-called 'art' in an effort to drag it out of the muck and mire of crappiness into spectacular mediocrity instead. So much a person could do , if he/she did not need to sleep. . .. zzz... SNORT, Buh, wha? Oops, sorry, must have dozed off for a moment there.

      Starcraft:Ghost - Is Blizzard Jumping the Shark?  It's old news already, but I'll say it again anyway : Blizzard has announced a 3rd person Metal Gear Solid clone /squad based tactical shooter in the Starcraft universe. Which is a frikkin good idea, imo. Where it turns sour though, is Blizzard's rather silly announcement that it will be developed for consoles only. No PC version or even a port planned. Nothin. Nada. Sweet fek all.  Way to go Blizzard, you have just  urlLink jumped the shark.  The fans are livid. Blizzard was to PC gamers what David Beckham is to soccer - Blizzard is today's  definition  of what makes computer games cool. We PC gamers , despite everything, despite the constant advances of consoles and console fans snubbing and ridiculing PC's as a gaming platform, despite it ALL , we at least had Blizzard. We had our trump card. No matter how many PC developers jumped ship, we could proudly say, "Our band, Blizzard, plays on!" Well, looks like the band has just jumped ship as well. Or is that the shark? Because alienating a huge existing fanbase in the hopes of securing console sales is precisely that. Compared to the console industry, pc gaming has  way  more in the way of competition - literally hundreds of developers , as opposed to the scant dozens for any one console. Giving a fanbase secured through years of hard work the proverbial finger is A Dumb Thing To Do(TM). All the baying dogs at Blizzard's heels need is an opportunity like this. Where Blizzard could have secured a sizeable and LONG TERM fanbase in the multiplayer first person/third person action genre (ala Tribes2), they've instead opted to make a quick buck on the consoles. An area virtually untouched on PC's as well, should they have chosen not to go multiplayer/FPS, is the Metal Gear Solid style 'shooter' on PC - there are precious few, if any. MGS2 was never ported to PC. The closest we come to stealth based games is the Rainbow Six / Ghost Recon franchise, and the ancient PSX port, the original Metal Gear Solid. But the PS2 has MGS2, and the XBOX will soon have Splinter Cell (as will the PC..). Where Blizzard had PC fans who would have bought Ghost no matter HOW crap it was, they instead choose to enter the console market, and let's face it : most console gamers couldnt give a crap about Blizzard. They want their racing games and their fighting games and their console RPG's. They want their Capcom games and their Electronic Arts titles and their Squaresoft products. A good portion of console gamers don't know Blizzard from a hole in the ground, whereas every single last motherfucking PC gamer on the planet knows who made Starcraft.  I could rant on and on - I'd love to see a PC version, I'd love to be able to play a zealot on the battle field and go toe to toe with other players, or jump into Goliath and go stomping around the Confed borderworlds shooting down Mutas, or lurk underground as a Hydralisk and ambush hapless marines as they come ambling along. Sadly, it looks like it may never happen. So way to go Blizzard. I give that Shark Jump a 10 out of 10.

      Revenge of the Hollywood Family Drama  It's funny. No doubt everyone has watched at least one Hoollywood Family Drama(TM) type of movie, you know, the cliche'd ones where mum and dad split up and then dad comes back 20 years later to make amends, or mum and dad break up and fall in love again later, or x, or y... I never thought those scenarios were based in reality though. Reality is more like "mum and dad break up and that's the end of it". Recently though I've been witnessing a Hollywood-ism of my own life happening. My old man and mum went their seperate ways something like 18 years ago, and I saw very little of the guy, we was content in leading a life unfettered by a wife and kids, good for him. But recently, he's been becoming more and more intent on getting to know his son (that's me) again. The funny thing, is I'm not really angry at the guy either. If this was Hollywood, I'd be ranting at the bloke spouting some nonsense like, "You weren't there for my little league baseball game" or something. Oddly, I don't feel that, I'm just happy to have a Dad again. Not exultant or weepy though, there's no Kleenex moments, we just hang, talk guy stuff, beers, food, you know.  It's comforting. I never really knew what it was like to have an old man - I grew up with the cardboard cutout type stepfather, one who really never gave a rats ass about the snot nosed brats that came saddled with the hot bird. (Yes, my mum was a hot bird in her day. Real covergirl material.) I was pretty much left to my own devices throughout my whole life, no real fatherly influence - perhaps it's why I became so engrossed in games and books and shit instead of the usual guy stuff consisting of sports, guns, v8's and beer. Sometimes I wonder how different it would have been had I had on old man. Had I taken an interest in guy stuff. Had I developed some semblance of self-esteem. No growing up boy deserves to live a life of solitude. Much as I hate to say it, I'm a pretty effeminate dork thanks to that. I think I would've been happier as a skirt chasing, grunting neanderthal. This so-called "intellectual" life is for the birds.

      Dreaded discontinuity.  Not that 15Minutes is being discontinued, rather that it isn't being updated as frequently as I'd like. But yeah, that's my problem. Todays issue - stress.  Stress. Even the word invokes that unpleasant tight-chested feeling. Stress really sucks. Like, it sucks when you boss comes to you and gives you an ultimatum and starts quoting phrases like " I want you to drive this" (um, it has a steering wheel?). I mean, what is it with stress? Why does it exist? We would be able to go about our lives so much better without it. someone once said, Panicking never solved anything. Aint that the truth. Stupid chemicals and human fear and instinct have, in any stress inducing incident, only  hampered  success. Someone scream "Bomb in the building!" at a crowded place, for instance, and watch everyone trample each other like stampeding cattle to get out. Whereas simply filing out calmly would probably get everyone out much faster. That exact same scenario can be applied to the workplace. When your boss comes to you and starts going on about deadlines and shit, your emotions start stampeding, running riot if you will. Fear and urgency and a myriad of others all clump together and block off whatever vision of a solution you may have had. And instead of going ahead and doing what needs to be done, you mutter and stammer and panic, and if anything is accomplished, it is done so at half the pace that you would have set for yourself had you merely acknowledged the urgency of the task and carried on as per usual.  So, adapt or die. Humanity needs to adapt to stress. right now it's killing off people at an astronomic rate - stress induced heart attacks and stress-related accidents (traffic accidents etc) are probably the number 1 causes of fatalities amongst the working middle class. Not terrorism or anthrax or even AIDS. So why isn't anyone doing anything about it? The workplace causes stress, yet so few workplaces offer employess ways to combat it. In some American companies , employers have recognised the risk of stress to their employees, and offer what we in the third world would laugh off as trivial - Tai-Chi classes, 'sleep areas' for afternoon siestas, etc. We office-masses in Africa are not offered such "luxuries", and yet we face the same stress , the same challenges that our foreign counterparts do (it being the Global Village now, you know...), and if we are to survive, if companies in Africa are to realise a profit from employees, they're going to have to begin adapting.

      Friday 13th  So far it's been a pretty uneventful Frifay 13th. No planes flying into buildings or earthquakes or  anything . Looks like it's THE most uneventful day of the year. Yay for that. I was interested in finding the reason(s) why Friday the 13th is considered so bad. Seems like it has something to do with the Pope (at the time) ordering the execution of the Knights Templar on Friday the 13th of October, 1307. And also something about Jesus dying on a Friday, and 13 being considered unlucky back in the dark ages because there are 13 menstrual cycles per average woman per year. Umm. Yeah... Personally, so far nothing majorly icky has come in the way of turning what may turn out to be another average weekend from happening. Sept 11 came and went, people bitched about America and Iraq and the fact that jelly babies taste naff when they're all melted. Whatever. Me, I'm just avoiding everyone and everything today. Traditionally, Friday 13th's  have  sucked, for me at least, and today is unnerving because  it isn't sucking . I keep getting the feeling that someone's gonna burst into my office demanding some or other explanation to some problem I'm not aware of, or something. Pretty much doing the turtle thing right now, just praying that 5 o clock arrives ASAP, and that those who'd have me eviscerated today for some or other frivolous  triviality  are blind to my existence, just for a few more hours... Invisible Office Man, signing out.

      9/11  Well, the first ever anniversary of 9/11 arrives tomorrow. Everyone and his brother/sister will probably have something to say about it, so I guess I'll throw in my 2 cents. I live in Africa. So it's no surprise then that I find very little sympathy among the locals for 9/11. Many people have attitudes akin to 'So what, thousands in Africa die every day to starvation'. Frankly, attitudes like that disgust me. How someone can watch the footage of the towers falling and not feel any sympathy for those who died that day, is beyond me. That many will denounce the loss of life as minor or inconsequential, ignoring the acts of incredible heroism carried out by the firemen who gave their lives to try and save the lives of others, disturbs me severely. Yes, people die every day. Yes, Africans are dying in the thousands because of famine. The difference is that those Africans dying daily are not being  murdered . It's a natural disaster. It's terrible, but it is the whim of God, Fate, whatever. Sep 11, on the other hand, was the whim of one insane man. That one man could cause the death of so many innocent civilians in a single day, is tragic. Not since the Holocaust and Hiroshima/Nagasaki has there been such a massive loss of human life caused by a single individual. That some are so ignorant that they can't  see  that, is disheartening to say the least.  In the wake of Sep 11 discussions, debate on  urlLink Prophecy  shifted to the Iraq situation, and the Bush/Blair intention of possibly pursuing military action against Saddam. Once again, many people dismiss it as frivolous, unnecessarry, hell even biased. It's time people woke up and smelled the nuclear weapons that Saddam is building. http://www.iraqwatch.org is an interesting site with some unnerving facts about Iraq and it's drive to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. India, Pakistan, China, Korea, they all have nukes, is it so unimaginable that Iraq might soon have nukes too? And as Saddam has evidenced in Kuwait less than a decade ago, he is more than willing to use military might to try and seize land. Are people so quick to forget what insane Muslim fundamentalists are capable of? Has 9/11 already been forgotten? If Osama had a nuke, he would have used it. Saddam is fast approaching the stage where he can give Osama a suitcase bomb. Everyone knows the 2 are big buddies, hating 'the West' equally - some reports even point to Saddam having a hand in financing Al-Quaeda. Getting a suitcase nuke into the US will not prove impossible. If not by air, then merely by boat, or across the Mexico/US or Canada/US border.   Personally, I'd rather see the Iraq / Middle East conflict resolved now, with conventional weapons, than wait another 6 years and see a US city obliterated in a nuclear strike. Because I'm pretty sure the US would be willing to drop The Bomb again in such a scenario, and personally, I do not find the prospect of living in a world embroiled in nuclear war at all appealing. Even if I live out here in Africa.

      Death  It takes a death for you to realise just how meaningless the daily trivialities of life really are. Like your job. Stressing out about some or other problem at work , some pointless task , worrying about deadlines or your boss shitting on you... it all means so very little. On Saturday, the family dog was hit by a car. Sure, it was only a dog, but that animal was like a member of the family. He had his own quirks, his own personality. While I will miss the bugger, it was my folks who were hit the hardest. While I'm not teary and an emotional wreck like my mum, the dog's death nonetheless caused something to click in my brain. A realisation that you should be spending your life enjoying it. Chasing money and material possesions, chasing a career that you despire..it all means nothing. You could be run over by the car of bad luck tomorrow, and what will it all have been  for ?

      Worst Games Ever. (this blog copy pasted from Prophecy forums. I was lazy)  So, we've seen dozens of debates about 'What's the best game ever'. My question to you now, is which games are the suckest, the worst, the lousiest piles of donkey-urine you have ever played?   To get the ball rolling, I propose this list (in no particular order)   1)Gender Wars. This was crap in a box. And the box itself was crap as well. Total swill.  2)Total Annihilation Kingdoms. Craptastic. The only word that can describe it.  3)Global Operations. Yukko. Stupid 'Dedicated Server' only feature meant you had to have a dedicated server to play on LAN. Sure, there was a switch or argument or something that you could use to bypass this, but it wasnt documented. Besides that, the game proper is a real sad attempt at cloning Counterstrike.  4)Ultima Ascension. I've never been able to play this one for longer than 45 minutes without it locking up, crashing, or exhibiting some weird game breaking bug. And it still runs at maybe 13 fps, even on my Athlon 1500. Bah.  5)Red Faction. I hated this FPS. The so-called 'destroy everything' engine was a gimmick - you could not, in fact, destroy everything, only some things, making it no different really from other FPS's like Quake or HalfLife that had you breaking down certain walls to get through some areas. Besides that, the dull weapons,graphics and truly uninspiring level design made this game one insipid boring waste of time.  6)Myst. I can't believe people liked this game. I could make a game like this using merely digitized photos hotlinked to each other. Utter , mindless drivel.  7)Dungeon Siege. Yes, you heard me. I find this title probably the worst example of a hack and slash ever devised. Absolutely kak. Stupid spells, no special moves or abilities for your fighter, and ugly character models. I find it so cool(not) adventuring in a bath robe and shower cap, hitting things with a stick with a twirly light, and casting Fireball, Big Fireball, and Bigger Than Big Fireball at monsters that look like bad Henson animatronics.  8)Redneck Rampage. Anyone remember this one? It was novel for about half an hour, then it just got trite and dumb.  9)Serious Sam 2. SS1 was fun for a while because it reintroduced the mindless arcade shooter. But SS2 was just more of the same. And frankly, it was just too much bull(haha). Really inane, I played for about 3 hours and uninstalled it. Nice graphics just aint enough.  Only worthwhile playing co-op.  10)And my personal worst game ever, a little title called Gene Wars from way bak when, that was just so insanely, ridiculously hard that it was completely and utterly impossible to win without cheating. It had cute graphics for it's time and a nice idea (cross breeding creatures to use as your army), but the execution was horribly flawed and the stupid attempt at humour did not work in the RTs setting. This was a title I loved to hate.   Honourable mentions include Dark Colony (example of how NOT to make an RTS) and Black and White(also known as How To Fool Gamers Into Thinking They Are Playing A Game, When In Fact They Are Merely Picking Up Monkey Shit And Throwing Rocks At Things)   If you have any suggestions, mail em to me at  urlLink khayne@webmail.co.za , or head on over  urlLink here  and post your list.

      Local Mags R Teh Suck.  Today I bought UK PC Gamer. Up until today, for the past , oh I don't know, 2 years or so, I've been only buying a local publication called 'New Age Gaming'. The reason being that it's cheaper (albeit, compared to PC Gamer, not by much), and that I wanted to support an effort by the locals. Now, I'm not so sure. Comparing NAG to PCGamer is like comparing a beat up, old glue-fodder mare to a prime racehorse. NAG really  is  a nag. A tired, ugly nag. Seriously, NAG's been in the business for years now, and I think it's only gone downhill. Recently, they stopped shipping the issues with cover CD's. Apparently they will be rectifying that shortly, but nonetheless - without the cover cd to lure us poor Africans without broadband into buying it, NAG has precious little to offer. And it's sad, because it isn't entirely a lack of content, but simply that the mag doesnt feel  polished . Everything about it screams 'amateur'. Horrible fonts on the cover, a garish layout, and the covers look really bad - each issue's cover is a hodge-podge of clippings , different font faces and sizes, murky text and just general 'ickiness'. It gets worse. Many of the reviews are really dull, or just filled with inconsistincies and mistakes. For example, they reviewed an ATI Radeon card recently, and refered to ATI's new Catalyst driver initative, as "Cataclysm's". This was repeated often. I know of several such examples where bad mistakes were made, unforgivable mistakes. As a game rag publisher, they just can't afford to make these kind of cock-ups. I don't know whether it's a lack of sufficient editing, or merely time constraints. Add to that the real lack of imagination regarding language use by many of the mags contributors , the pretty damn sad lack of humour in the screencap captions, and so on and so on - and it's easy to see why I can't help but feel that NAG is a really sub-par publication. I hate to say it, but even SA PCFormat does a better job regarding layout and content. Sure, it's copy-pasted from the UK version, but that just illustrates how much  better  the UK and American mags are.  Fact is, NAG relies on a core of fans who will buy the mag no matter what - perhaps to save a few bucks, perhaps to support an SA initiative. I was one of those fans, but now I doubt I'll miss any sleep if I miss buying the next NAG. As long as CNA keeps distributing UK-PCGamer here, I'll keep buying it, it's easily worth the extra 20 bucks to get a real quality publication. My message to NAG fans - try thinking out of the box for a moment. We, as readers, deserve the best our money can buy in a publication, and the sad truth is that NAG just doesnt deliver. Pick up a foreign import mag every now and again and compare - I'm sure you'll see where I'm coming from. And if a NAG employee ever reads this blog, here are a few pointers, and a few things to consider. One, this isn't simply pointless flaming, this is honest concern from someone who used to be a big NAG fan. It's time to up your standards. Yes, it's great that you're bringing back the cover cd, yes it's great that you're including posters - these are all great gimmicks, but they aren't enough. It's time you guys took yourselves seriously. Look at your font faces, look at your layouts, look at your cover. Keep It Simple, Stupid. Get an identity, create a brand. Don't clutter the cover too much, it looks  ugly . Take a look at PCGamer. Or Electronic Gamer Monthly. And try to emulate them. Don't accept mediocrity - we consumers don't.

      African Time, and Windows XP.  Just another random rant from I. Yesterday, the small 3rd world African country in which I reside (much to my everlasting chagrin) switched back from Daylight Savings, to Normal time. What a pain in the ass. Trying to get up an hour ealier in the morning is  hell . Those of you who don't live in countries using Daylight Savings - thank whatever respective deity you worship. Daylight savings is a really  bad  idea. I don't know who thought it up first, but he/she should be publicly flogged.  What has this got to do with Windows XP, you may ask. Absolutely nothing. Just thought I'd waste a few minutes of my time and a few kb's on whichever server is hosting this blog, to expound on what a decent OS it is. Installation was really effortless, it looks and runs quite nicely., it's stable...what more could you ask for? Seems like MS finally got it right. Granted, I'm late to jump on the XP bandwagon, but I figure, what the hell, time to embrace the future - you can only live in the past for so long.

      The Great Case Mod Update.  Well, decided against using that massive 120MM fan. Apparently the magnetic field caused by it's induction motor, is a little severe. Will be sticking with standard 12V DC fans. Managed to actually find some fan grilles for said fans in this burg - quite an accomplishment I must say. My old man also has a 27mm metal hole saw someplace,  which will prove  much  easier for cutting holes than using a jigsaw. Methinks, sometimes it's smarter to try and lighten the workload, eh? Chances for success improve dramatically if you lower your standards... ;) Hope to get some photos done of the process and post em. Ve shall zee...

      Sex, drugs, rock n roll...  Yeah , I know - weird topic. It just popped into my head during a discussion on the PH board about absinthe, and it's recent legalisation (or so I hear) in SA.  I used to be involved in the mild stuff. The herbals. Weed. Looking back, I realise ever getting involved with that stuff was a mistake. When I was on the leaf, I was a washout. Like, a complete llama. It very nearly cost me my scholarship. The will to better yourself evaporates after a few tokes. And while the desire to enjoy life is admirable, I feel to do so under the influence of a drug, is pointless. Because that's not  me . It's the same with alcohol. After enough beers, I'm a friendly guy... but it isn't  me  I'd rather someone like me when I'm me. Because that's the person they'd have to live with most of the time. It reminds me of that movie with Sandra Bullock - 28 Days. I was her - sans boobies of course. Today, I'm clean. I hardly even touch booze - usually a single beer is enough. The bad experiences I've had with booze, I could write a novel about. Suffice to say waking up in your own puke (or worse) loses it's appeal after the sixth or seventh time. That I'm still alive today is a wonder - how I had repeatedly managed to drive home barely able to see the road, is beyond me. The only plausible explanation is that  someone  up there wanted me alive - at least for now. You can only tempt fate for so long though.  I'm not condemning drug or alcohol use. Some people are willing to take the risks. I just realised that I wasn't. I'm clean and sober today - and actually  happier  than I was back then. Maybe being clean and sober is just who I was meant to be.

      More fiddlin shenanigans  God bless my old man. He has a box full of  massive  , 220V, 120CM UPS fans in the garage. Said I could have one. We'll be mounting that sucker in my PC case tonight, or sometime this week or this weekend. It's a monster of a fan. I'll have to run it directly off mains instead of off 12V PSU supply. We're gonna put a little rocker switch on the case someplace, and wire it directly to the 220V power out plug on the back of the PSU. I don't know how much air that thing pushes, but it must be a LOT. Funny how we do these things not because they're strictly necessarry (my CPU runs within operational temperature limits), but because we can. Oh and to show off. Yessir. I want to go to the next lan and see guys' eyes pop out their heads when they see the size of that fan stuck in the side of my case. God, sound like a 12 year old , but hey, I guess comparing metaphorical penis size is just part of being male.

      Egads  Yesterdays blog was such a load of rubbish. Reading it now, I am quite shocked I could be such a selfish, whiny little bitch. Anyway. Emotions are feeble things.  Almost wrecked my Pc yesterday after buying a new case and trying to wrestle the motherboard out of the old one. For some stupid reason, the manufacturers of the new case released mounting brackets with screws that , for some obscure reason, didnt fit well with said brackets - they stripped almost immediately. I had to pry the damn board loose with a pliers and a flat screwdriver. A quick slip of the hand and I had scraped the back of the board good. After a tense 2 hour process I managed to transplant everything, and wasn't surprised when the PC didnt want to boot. fortunately, after thinking about the problem and not immediately attributing the problem to my clumsy haste, I deduced that I hadn't configured the jumper on my primary hard disk correctly. A  quick tweak with the needlenose pliers, and I was sailing smoothly again. I think the people down the road heard my sigh of relief. They probably heard me cursing God before that as well. :/  It gets FRIKKIN hot here this time of year, so my next pet project is to mod my case and install 3 new fans. I'm going to try and do it properly - the previous mod I did was a real hatchet job. I'll post some shots , maybe, if it turn out OK.  In closing -  why  do us men always feel the need to do dumb things like this ourselves?  I could pay some techie a few bucks to do it for me, save myself a lot of hassle and get it done properly...but no, for some reason, that thought never crossed my mind, and now that it has, it's so quickly dismissed. I still have to ask the question though. I guess it's that all-male drive to fiddle with things and  fuck  them up completely that drove the human race to invent shit like fire and the wheel and rockets and the A-Bomb. Perhaps it's a good thing. Although how many cavemen burnt themselves discovering fire in the first place? How many people died testing manned rockets? Not to mention the Bomb. I guess with the desire to create and fiddle and fuck shit up, comes the possibility of accomplishing either great things, or terrible things. Or you can just end up with a pile of fucked up shit which you take to the PC repair experts and ends up costing you three times as much to fix than if you'd merely taken it to them in the first place. I wonder, are we really super-intelligent, or just downright too damn stubborn to do things the easy way?

      Hell = other people?  They say familiarity breeds contempt, and I tend to agree with the mysterious "they". A short blog today, but something I felt needed to be aired. I live with my folks still. Yup, 24, still living with the folks, how pathetic , I hear you cry. No matter, think what you will, personally, I prefer to try and save as much money wherever I can - freedom is overrated, having money is not. Anyway, back to the topic : one of the parental units left for a week to Washington DC, and I must say, it's refreshing. Much as I love my folks, it's good to have a "breather" from it all. Possibly a reason for never having been involved in a meaningful relationship, is that I just can't stand people, I detest "maintenance". Well, that's it. Not much else to say today. Bought a new case for my PC which I intend to install tonight in blissful silence without demands for  whatever  being rained down upon me.  Sweet lonesome bliss.

      Wow...  How ironic. Yesterday I ranted at celebs. Today, an  idol  of mine, web-artist T.Catt, mails me to say the link on my  urlLink site  pointing to his site, is outdated. I was amazed, that he'd think my lame site portraying my lame attempt at sketchwork, was important enough to have it's link page updated to reflect the correct URL. It was all I could do to stammer out a reply , trying not to sound like a rabid fan. We make our own celebs, I guess, and for our own reasons. Millions might adore some no-talent no-skill pop idol for whatever obscure reason, but I admire artists like  urlLink Catt . And, I guess, for the same reason that millions adore those pop stars and good looking actors out there - they want to be like them. Personally, I've never cared what  I  look like, but really appreciate beauty in artwork of the female form. Playboy centrefolds and porn doesnt interest me so much as the work of Catt, Royo, Vajello. And it isn't exposed flesh that excites me so much as the  seductivity  portrayed in such art. Seeing something I sketch come to life and look me in the face is unparralleled - especially on those rare occasions when what I sketch doesnt resemble gutter trash.  I guess we all need someone to look up to.  /*disclaimer - the work of T.Catt is quite adult in nature and may contain nudity and more... he has a section for non-erotica, so if you don't like admiring art of nekkid wimmen, be sure to at least check out the 'softcore' section.*/

      Democracy just doesn't work in Africa...at least not yet.  With the recent announcement of Mbeki's cabinet, I think it's pretty clear that democracy doesn't quite work in Africa. I'm going to be blunt here, and may even be misconstrued as being racist. Frankly, democracy won't work because of the backwards electorate. The majority is, frankly, still rather stupid. Uneducated. Backwards. Most can barely read or write - they sign ballots with an X, after being prompted by an election official which string of meaningless characters is the current popular party's representative. They're too simple to discern outright lies and campaign propoganda from real policies. They're manipulated by violence or the threat of violence in the case of Zimbabwe, or simple fear in the case of South Africa and Namibia. Fear that voting for anyone other than the party that threw off the shackles of their previous oppressors would result in a return to that state of affairs. It takes acts of monumental inhumanity before such rather basic people would take a risk. Something like a civil war.  An example. What would have happened, had democracy been suddenly introduced to feudal England? It took the English hundreds of years to gradually adapt to the idea of majority rule. It took ages to abandon monarchy as a form of government and choose democracy. It wasn't an overnight thing. The same is happening in Africa, particularly Southern Africa. Colonial Europe took a very basic people, exploited them, felt guilty afterwards, and then chose the path of attempting to prepare them for a form of independant governance completely alien to a people only used to nepotism. It is only natural for such a people to backslide back to nepotism and dictatorship when the reigns are handed over. In some situations it's obvious (Mugabe), in others, not so obvious (Mbeki appointing buddies and sycophants to cabinet).  Africa hasn't had the time that the rest of the free world was granted to adapt to democracy. It's been shoved on Africa, and Africa has accepted it because A)the rest of the civilised world had outlawed everything else, and b) people, no matter whether they're ready for it or not, will jump at the chance for real liberty.  Russia and Africa, for example, share much of the characteristics of a sudden change to democracy. Violence. Crime. Corruption. Power plays. Division. Secession. The list goes on.  It all happened too fast. Yes, Colonialism no longer has a place in the world, neither does Apartheid, or Communism. But going from Apartheid rule to true Democracy in the space of barely a decade, is just too much to deal with. Hell, no-one could. Eastern Europe apparently can't. They're still killing each other in the Balkans. And this hasty Iraq pullout that even Bush is aiming for, now, won't either. It's a mistake. The war wasn't, but not going the whole nine yards is.  What's the solution? I doubt there is such a thing as a quick fix. In fact, I believe the belief in quick fixes is the whole problem. Countries with stable democracies today had to go through long and bitter civil wars. The liberal peacenik handling of South Africa's switchover has/had many the worldover applauding, but South Africans themselves know that all is  not  in fact, very well. For a short while, while Mandela was running things, it looked like SA would get it right, where almost everyone else had failed. Why? Because it had it's benovelent, absolute ruler. A monarch. A kind King to guide the nation. Now? Now it has a normal man.  A President. With all his foibles, faults and inconsistincies. Not a saint forged in the hells of a life in prison. Just an average schmo. A true Democracy can nonetheless function with such a leader (as evidence : the USA, and Bush). I doubt a fledgling African nation can.

      The New York Post has  urlLink the following  today :   "The vat majority of the UN Oil-for-food contracts have  urlLink mysteriously vanished , crippling investigators trying to uncover fraud in the program, a government report charged yesterday.  The General Accounting Office report, presented at a congressional hearing into the scandal-plagued program, determined that 80 percent of U.N. records had not been turned over.   The world body claims it transferred all information it had - including 3,059 contracts worth about $6.2 billion for delivery of food and other civilian goods to the post-Saddam governing body, the Coalition Provisional Authority.   But the GAO report also found that a database the U.N. transferred to the authority was "unreliable because it contained mathematical and currency errors in calculation of contract costs," the report found.   The GAO findings, which were aired at a hearing of the House International Relations Committee, raise new questions about corruption and mismanagement in the biggest-ever U.N. aid program - and what has been called the biggest financial scandal in history. An earlier GAO report said Saddam ripped off over $10 billion.   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said the report raised serious concerns - and could have "a potential impact on the reputation and credibility of the United Nations."     Well. It's about time this story saw some exposure in some major media. So far the UN's evident ineptitude and corruption has thus far fallen on deaf ears. How this can be a non-issue to so many around the world just blows my mind. Conspiracy theorists and leftists who would jump at any chance to sling mud at the vaporous Bush-Cheny-Halliburton 'scam' (so far proving to be nothing but baseless rumourmongering), choose to instead hum and ha about the Oil-for-food fiasco. Not only was there sufficient documented evidence, now that evidence has 'dissappeared'? Good grief.  Where's the so-called objectivity, huh?

      LeMonde - highly critical and anti-American French newspaper - mumbles : "Maybe Bush  didn't  lie... promptly hides said article on page 32. Surprise surprise.    "Can one at this time conclude with certainty that these weapons don't exist?", Le Monde's Mouna Nam quotes issue 1 (volume 69) of Politique trangre as asking. "No, answer WMD specialists and experts in articles published in the latest issue of the quarterly review".  Mainly because, first of all, for 11 years, from 1991 to 2003, the Iraqi rgime never stopped lying in one respect or another; and, furthermore, numerous questions asked by the disarmament teams, which operated in Iraq under the umbrella of Unscom until 1998 and under that of Unmovic from late November 2002, remain unanswered.   Tim Trevan, spokesman for, and former advisor to the executive director of, the UN's special commission on Iraq,  uncovers other examples of crude lies, put forward by some of Iraq's most senior leaders. More worrisome is the ambiguity that Iraq deliberately maintained on the upkeep of the WMD weapons.    Thrse Delpech, an advisor at the Centre d'tudes et Recherches Internationales and a Unmovic commissioner reminds us of certain elements in Unmovic's report of March 6, 2003. "The inspectors were never able to check what happened to 3.9 tons of VX  In March 2003, Unmovic concluded that very likely, there still existed 10,000 liters of anthrax that Iraq had not destroyed."    The same questions remain unanswered concerning the Al-Samud-2 missiles, the 6,256 bombs that Iraq finally admitted not having used in its war against Iran, 550 artillery shells which are still said to be missing, and some thirty biological bombs.   Now, isn't that interesting? And mightn't that information warrant being set somewhere on, or near, the front page? And would that not demand a special story all for itself, instead of falling within the review of a sister publication?  Well, in ordinary circumstances, the answer would be, Yes, absolutely; you bet your cotton-picking a**. But you have to remember here, that we are dealing with the world's number 1 enemy, the most horrible threat to world peace, the most treacherous of societies the planet has ever come across. Whom are we speaking of? But l'Amrique, bien sr, its horrifying capitalism, and its despicable leaders.   -quoted from  urlLink eriksvane.com

      The fruits of appeasement, SA...   urlLink SA foils plot to disrupt elections.    Now  things are getting interesting. Going by past deeds, 'disruption' by al-Queda means blowing up trains, restaurants, embassies etc.  The trend is as clear as day. Al-Queda targets governments it thinks terror attacks can topple. It targets people it thinks are weak. They tried it with the USA - and failed miserably. They succeeded with Spain. SA foiled the attacks before they could begin.. but what if they had succeeded? Would SA have gone the way of the USA? Or Spain?  MAybe some will realise after this that al-Queda's agenda has never been terrorism for the sake of liberation. Their plan is the globalisation of Islam. It may sound nuts, but their plan is global domination. Through fear. Sympathy to their 'cause' and appeasement does not work - it only makes one appear weak in their eyes, and thus an easy target.  I, for one, will fight these slime to my last, dying breath. It's time to wake up to the threat of Islamic terror, Africa.

      WMD found  An artillery shell loaded with Sarin Gas was used today as a makeshift roadside bomb by insurgents.  urlLink Command Post has the scoop.   Is it finally proof that Iraq did, in fact, have WMD's during the old regime? I believe so, but I'm pretty sure the world's spin doctors will downplay it - again - due the fact that it was merely a single shell. Where there's smoke, theres fire, I say.

      CAIR panickingly denounces beheading.   urlLink Source.   "And it says that just as America cannot be judged by what it calls 'often misguided foreign policy' or  torture  committed by American soldiers, neither should the world of Islam 'be held accountable for the un-Islamic and barbaric deeds of a minuscule minority.'   Why is it that every statement they make has to include some antigovernmental rhetoric? A bloody  meteor  could demolish Baghdad and CAIR would somehow pin it on US 'misguided foereign policy' or some such hogwash.  As for 'torture'? Abuse, yes..but calling it  torture , is either shortsighted, plain stupid...or clever enough to appear sympathetic towards the beheading without alienating CAIR's Muslim backing. Torture is flogging. Or pulling out fingernails. Cutting off bits, feeding people through woodchippers, etc. Torture is systematic and sanctioned. Parading some gits around naked with panties on their heads -  torture ? My ass. But hey - we can't pass up an opportunity to take a shot at the Great Satan, eh - even when uttering some mumbled half-assed attempt at appearing genuinely concerned.

       urlLink More land grabs on the horizon.   "De Wet was careful not to strongly criticise the first Government notices to expropriate farms, pointing out that the Land Conference held in 1991 stated that unproductive farms and those held by foreigners should be first in line.  The NAU President said he knew of four farms that had received the notices, but expected the list to grow to more than 10 in the next few days.  These farms appear to be mainly where labour relations have been strained and from which workers have been evicted.  'As far as we are concerned these farms do not fall under the category of under-used and unproductive farms,' said De Wet."

      The land grab saga continued....   urlLink Great letter.  The scariest part - it seems to indicate that mismanagement of state-acquired farms for the purpose of redistribution, is nothing new.  "The half-farm Westfalen (next to Uhlenhorst) was bought nine years ago and demonstrates how taxpayers' money and investment capital are wasted.  The Government bought this farm of approximately one thousand hectares with seventeen thousand citrus trees for N$ 1.67 million since the previous owner annually harvested between 40,000 and 46,000 bags of 5kg oranges each.  Mismanagement by now has 1 000 trees surviving."  Scary.  Props to Clem.

      Should we deal in ivory?  It's rare that I agree with any proposals the Namibian government makes, but on this issue I have to agree with the government's request that the  urlLink ivory ban be loosened . ( urlLink another link ) At least, to a degree. Looking at the Etosha elephant population, over the past couple of decades, conservation efforts have been successful to the point where  urlLink elephant herds are now overpopulating  Etosha to the point of decimating the park's flora. Many now die of starvation, many more have to be culled to prevent the park from turning into a wasteland. Relocating the excess is simply not an option. As a result, elephant ivory is being stockpiled by the conservation effort instead of simply left to rot.  Using this natural resource to perhaps alleviate some of the locals' abject poverty, possibly even lend a degree of economic empowerment/independance to a people so reliant on government assistance, is far from immoral, in my opinion. Would loosening the ban promote poaching? It's possible, but considering we have massive stockpiles currently, I tend to doubt. One thing is for certain, it will have to be carefully regulated and controlled. Locals would have to buy the ivory from the government at very cheap rates, lest they be tempted to poaching instead. What I don't support, however, is for government  itself  to export ivory en-masse to international markets. This resource should solely be provided to licensed locals - artists and the like. This would vitalise the tourist trade, forcing foreigners to come  here  to acquire the white gold, and would be a better long-term solution as opposed to exporting the raw ivory in bulk to China.

       urlLink Don't follow their script.   "The hooded men who sawed Berg's neck for the cameras didn't do it because they were shocked or outraged by our treatment of prisoners. (Does anyone take this idea seriously?) They executed him because we were shocked and outraged and because they hoped that, wallowing in our own scandal, we would blame ourselves for his death.   Those recriminations, they figured, would weaken us further. And just to make sure, they even read a slavering statement making the murder's connection with Abu Ghraib explicit.   Hey, it worked with Spain, didn't it? There, following the deadly train bombing in Madrid, more than a few citizens took the bait the terrorists intended: that the country had been a target because of its participation in Iraq. Staging their slaughter a few days before the elections, the terrorists correctly predicted it would create a miniwave of self doubt sufficient to elect a government more to al-Qaida's liking.

       urlLink US contractor beheaded.   Dear sweet Jesus.  Only Muslims. In this day, only they could do something like this. Only they could saw a persons head off on tape. Only they could set alight their women or butcher their children to retain their 'honour'. Enlightened westerners may occasionally humiliate and maybe even slap around the occasional murdering terrorist, but compared to this latest act by the Religion of Peace, they look like  saints .  It makes one realise just how savage these people are.  They're still living in the dark ages. They still exist in a time where an enemy is fit only to be butchered like an animal. They still have the mindsetsimiliar to those who would nail an innocent man to a cross on allegations of heresy. They live in a time where women are still merely objects. Property.  And the worst part - so many 'enlightened' westeners don't realise that this has to change. It  must . The world has moved on. Islam has not. The time has come for this religion to adapt - like others have done - or die out. It  cannot  be allowed to keep claiming lives - and be defended for doing so purely on the grounds of it  being a religion  That is just. Not.Acceptable. And don't give me any pap about this being solely the work of purely absolutely radical fundamentalists.

      "A vote for Bush is a vote for rape"  Ha.  I found this quote from a commentator on ASmallVictory, quite insightful :  "The drooling glee with which the American Left has embraced these abuses is positively pornographic. They don't care that the rule of law and military justice was on the case, that investigations, even punishments were already being handed out. That it happened at all is enough. They just moved it to the top on their Bushiephobia list, along with causing 9/11, the jailing of anyone who "dissents", and any number of imaginings now presented as "fact."" -darleen  Sadly, it ain't just the American Left, darleen. Virtually every freedom-endorsing newspaper (ie, the same papers who routinely ignore human rights abuses such as  urlLink this ), and every second liberal outside of the US is choking at the bit at these pictures. Anyone advocating taking the situation with just a  pinch  of salt is accused of attempting to justify this situation - by the exact same people who justified the Fallujah butchering of those contractors. Hell, Iraqi hostage-takers execute an Italian on tape and no-one in the 'meaningful media' bats an eyelid. Shot. In the head. Ho hum. Par for the course. But have some murdering bastards parade around naked, and the world has an aneurysm. Or so the media would have us believe. The only reason I can think of is that it's  great  for certain people to have some real ammunition, finally. No-one could make the missing WMD allegations really  stick , nobody seriously bought the "It's All About The Oil!" conspiracy myth..but  this ..well.. there's pictures!  I mean, it's terrible what happened, sure - but am I the only one thinking that perhaps this is being blown  way  out of proportion?  And again - what media bias?  urlLink Islam assasinates  the Chechen president, and the media emits hardly a peep. Some sadistic genocidal twit in a wheelchair gets it and he's painted as a bonafide  saint  to this day by the media?  I mean, what.

      Some local news.   urlLink Presidential-candidate race heats up  as ruling party members wrestle and squabble amongst themselves in the rush to seize power. Rather reminiscent of the Dems in the States so recently. My money's on Nahas Angula. In the end, what'll matter is being able to swing votes from the rather simplistic majority. At the very least he's promoting 'Unity', 'Fairness' and 'Progress', although those words have thus far meant very little coming from the current administration. So far all we Namibians have witnessed is continued below-the-surface segregation, race-based discrimination in the form of rigid affirmitave-action policies, and progress solely in the size of the government car fleet and our President's magnificent 250-million Namibian Dollar retirement mansion. At least we now have the  hope  of positive change. At least Nujoma refrained from altering the Constitution to allow for another term. It's funny. He was hailed as a hero for simply adhering to the current Constition. I think fears of him pulling a Mugabe were pretty rampant, and the relief expressed by so many when he chose to embrace common sense was metamorphosed into hero-worship to appease him lest he change his mind.  And just when a glimmer of hope shines...   "THE head of Namibia's Government-owned bi-weekly New Era newspaper has scoffed at suggestions that a planned regional publication by his organisation and Zimbabwean state run media will be a propaganda tool to counter "anti-Zimbabwe stories". New Era Managing Director, Protasius Ndauendapo, told The Namibian yesterday that the idea of a new newspaper was conceived from "purely business principles". "People should not think that there is a political agenda. We were not pushed by any politician to embark on the project... this is a purely business venture," maintained Ndauendapo."    urlLink Ha.

      Well, it looks like those US servicemen responsible for the tortue and abuse of some 20 Iraqi prisoners  urlLink are getting an earful.   I see this as a good thing. While I understand that the stresses of warfare can create this kind of reaction, turning  any  normal human being into virtual sociopaths (even temporarily), in this particular situation allowing it to prevail is not an option. The US is having a hard enough time convincing the world - hell even it's own citizens - that it did the right thing invading Iraq. It doesn't need gung-ho trigger happy farmboys perpetuating the stereotype that  all  US citizens are violent 'sand-nigger-killin' racists. Sadly, world opinion is shallow and moronic enough to buy such a stereotype based purely upon face value.

      This has got to be One Sick Joke.   urlLink From here... , props to  urlLink Allah   ""Islam, with its practices, is the best of international systems that could achieve peace," said Mohamed Dissouki, an International Law professor at Al-Azhar University, in the conference.   Abdel-Salam also stressed that the role of the United Nations should be enhanced and its system modified to prevent domination of specific countries.   He was referring to the veto power wielded by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council; the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain.   Dissouki, was of the same mind.   "The International Law has recently tilted towards unequal treatment of people, as some agreements turned into valueless pieces of paper when they came against the interests of such a super power as the United States," he lamented.   Islam, on the other hand, deeply respects vows, treaties and agreements and warns against the serious consequences of their violation, Dissouki averred."  You have got to be kidding me.  I'd spend time shooting this to bits, but I think anyone with half an ounce of common sense wouldn't  need  me to. I mean, sure, let's implement Shari'ah Law globally, let's legalize beating/murdering our wives and children if they 'shame' us, let's make global priority the complete extermination of the Jew, let's flush hundreds of years' worth of scientific advancement down the crapper and go back to believing the world is flat.

Ed Koch, former mayor of New York,  urlLink says it best:   "The movies diatribes, sometimes amusing and sometimes manifestly unfair, will not change any views. They will simply cheapen the national debate and reinforce the opinions on both sides."

       urlLink Cut and Run.   So, as of today, Iraq is controlled by Iraq. Possibly for the first time in many a decade. Which is all well and good, but does anyone else get the distinct feeling that the US is cutting it's losses and getting the hell out? America has lost the PR war, which is saddening - it's doubtful that America will ever again be able to 'do good' in the name of liberation. People will look back and view today as the day America said, "the hell with the world, they don't appreciate us - let them sort their own shit out." And it's happening. Force reduction in Germany. Handing responsibility for training and security over to Nato. Cowing to a little bad press, the Bush Administration has taken a step back and decided to focus on trying to win the next election : so politics once again gets in the way of doing the Right Thing. Iraq will probably sink back into the cesspool of violence and dictatorship it was pre-Gulf War 2. Give it a couple months, or a year and the theocrats will have iron control of Iraq, sculpting it into Iran-Lite. No doubt America's detractors, calling for the US's complete withdrawal now, will blame the US for that too, somehow. What I forsee for the next couple of decades (my lifetime) :  The US will probably want less and less to do with providing security to Europe and the middle-east, and will instead retreat behind it's ballistic-missile shields or whatever. Wars in the third world will break out, there will be more violence and genocide, and yes, probably nuclear war between squalling petulant dictators who just got their hands on nukes thanks to the IAEA's incompetence and America's choice to adopt a pre-WW2 state of non-involvement. But that seems to be what the world wants, so hey, America - give it to them. Ignore the pleas for salvation when Rwanda-esque massacres become nom-de-rigeur across the ME. I, for one, am actually  totally and unequivocally  for a complete disengagement plan. It's what the Arabs want, after all. Let them have it.

They used electric probes on sensitive parts of my body and beat me. There were others in the torture chambers who were treated far worse.

      So, sadly, Roedolf (aka TheRodent) has caved to Sentech's demands that  urlLink mywirelesssucks.co.za be taken down .  Saddening in itself, it highlights a major problem with Southern African economies. We're all still way too reliant on monopolies. This pseudo-capitalistic 'privatisation' of state-owned subsidies, is not the answer. So governments no longer own 100% of the parastatals - instead, the trend is now to hang on to 51% - giving them just enough leverage to control the entity as they see fit, yet also spread some of the risk to other poor slobs who'd like to professionalise, for example, the telecommunications industry. Meanwhile SNO's are snowballed by government (after all, they have a rather selfish interest in seeing their 51% investment generate profit...) and the monopolies just continue to exist. I know firsthand. I worked for our (Namibia's) Telecomms parastatal for one whole uncomfortable year. The level of incapability and just sheer flat out  slowness  in accomplishing anything, was frightening. And it came from the rather top-heavy higher-rungs,  not  the bottom. Innefficient management is the prime cuplrit. It's way too tempting to maintain the status-quo, after all. So, Africa, you'll excuse me if I don't buy into this whole 'look at us we're partly owned by the private sector!' PR crap. Same old monolithic, rustic monopolies, same old crappy service - just hidden under new, and false, pretences.  We need complete privatisation  now . If it doesn't happen soon, it isn't going to happen, period. Take a lesson from every other greedy, corrupt little African nation, SA - if monopolies are allowed to continue to exist, they will do anything they can to hold onto their status as sole-providers. It merely stunts economic growth. Rather struggle  now , with costly infrastructure development and whatnot, than become yet another progress-crippling dinosaur.  Commentary has a good article related on the issue of privatisation  urlLink over here.

      Responding to my response to a  urlLink comment on Commentary relating to SpaceShipOne's success yesterday , detailing my concern that the private sector's preoccupation with the bottom-line may in fact hinder the development of private space travel, Wayne writes :   "I think it'll likely be pushed to follow a model closer to the modern air travel and industry. Test pilots will likely continue to shoulder the burden of undertaking the risky study of new prototypes but part of the equation of the rational consumer is that they'll also demand high safety standards relative to the price they're willing to pay out so there will be expectations.   That being said, there were higher rates of failure with early mass travel models and there will inevitably be accidents in space as well. When the first one happens, it will be front page news especially as a result of its novelty value compared to modern air crashes. But provided that their frequency reaches and then follows a similar level of failure as compared with everyday air travel, the public will be willing to accept it, as it hasn't stopped them on normal airlines and Columbia hasn't stopped NASA entirely either. The brave souls will also be more likely to shoulder the risks than the average person (who can initially afford such trips)."  Wayne makes a poignant point. Disasters didn't stop the air-travel industry from belly-flopping. Which is strange, considering how the crash of the Hindenburg basically single-handedly put an end to that specific mode of mass-transit.  Maybe it's just a case of how high-profile such disasters are, such as the Hindenburg and Columbia were. Had SpaceShipOne crashed and burned, I'm sure it would've set the industry back tens of years. That it succeeded instead, may make future failures irrevelant.  I am, however, concerned that this is not the quite the late 1800's or early 1900's, where no expense was spared by the pioneers of that time. Today's private sector is an entirely different creature, there's just so much more competition. If companies start jockeying for the space-tourist trade, to undercut each others prices they very well could quite easily and intentionally sacrifice passenger safety. This world of today is also a lot less tolerant of death, accidental or no. 60 years ago, a hundred thousand men dying to take one beachhead was shrugged off as necessary. There is no way in hell that would be accepted today. Instead, 500 Americans die in the space of a year in Iraq, and the media likens the 'quagmire' to Vietnam every chance it gets. We've come a long way - even the  slightest  failures are no longer tolerated.  But there's a lot of passion there, I'm pretty sure (as Wayne is) most of humanity would be willing to take the risks assosciated with space-travel. It's our generation's frontier - something we've never really had. I suppose we'll all be willing to embrace the danger for such a magnificent payoff. I'm not sure if I, personally, would, but I'm certain merely the existence of thrill-seekers with loads of spare cash -like Mark Shuttleworth- will keep the development of the private-sector space-travel industry going.

      It's heartening to hear  urlLink real, outspoken anger  at Islamofascist horror-killings coming from the heart of the middle-east, and much as it pains to say it, maybe something good has come from the killings of Berg and now Johnson. The terrorists are now fighting a war on two fronts - something history has shown is unwinnable.   JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- The kidnapping and beheading of American Paul Johnson Jr. may mark a turning point in Saudi public opinion against his al-Qaida slayers.  Celebrations broke out at the news Friday that Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, the man responsible for Johnson's death, had been killed. It was the first time in the Saudis' 13-month fight against terrorism that ordinary citizens expressed joy at security forces' success.  "Whatever their disagreements with the United States, however much they are against U.S. support for Israel or the war in Iraq, Saudis feel that Americans and foreigners in general should be able to feel safe in the kingdom," says Turki al-Dakheel, who hosts a show on the Al Arabiya network.  The need to win over public opinion has become more apparent as the Saudi government intensifies its battle against terrorists. If popular sentiment turns away from jihadists, analysts say, it could undermine their ability to find support in the form of hiding places and suicide cars.

      Whoa, this is pretty interesting (copied from lgf)   urlLink How much of the 'scandal' is merely posturing by detainees , I wonder?    Lesson Eighteen  PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS  IF AN INDICTMENT IS ISSUED AND THE TRIAL, BEGINS, THE BROTHER HAS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING:  1 . At the beginning of the trial, once more the brothers must insist on proving that torture was inflicted on them by State Security [investigators ]before the judge.  2. Complain [to the court] of mistreatment while in prison.  3. Make arrangements for the brother s defense with the attorney, whether he was retained by the brother s family or court-appointed.  4. The brother has to do his best to know the names of the state security officers, who participated in his torture and mention their names to the judge.[These names may be obtained from brothers who had to deal with those officers in previous cases.]    As for  urlLink this...  I wouldn't mind seeing these tapes leaked to the Internet. Maybe it would help remind people just exactly what was accomplished with Saddam's removal from power.

The Saudi daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat, monitored in Beirut, reports Iran has massed four battalions at the border.  Al-Sharq al-Awsat quoted "reliable Iraqi sources" as saying, "Iran moved part of its regular military forces towards the Iraqi border in the southern sector at a time its military intelligence agents were operating inside Iraqi territory."   Wow. I mean..just. Wow. If this pans out, it'll make Gulf War 2 look like a picnic.

      Terreblanche was freed recently.  I was speaking to my stepdad yesterday after watching the Carte Blanche interview with Eugene Terreblanche, and I commented, "Well, he says he's found God". My stepdad replied : "He said he'd found  his  God." The difference is like black to white. (haha.)  His comments that SA is no democracy, rankled. South Africa's commitment to peace, stability and fair play resulted in him walking free today. He was in for a lousy 3 years as an enemy of the state. Mandela was in for what - 30?  He's still a dangerous man. Hitler proved that all a radical minority needs to seize power is the fiery rhetoric they need to 'kry gas'.

      The Day After Tomorrow won't happen anytime soon. According to  urlLink this , at least another 15 000 years.    Over the last 800,000 years the Earth has, on the whole, been a pretty chilly place. Interglacials - or warm spells - have come every 100,000 years and have generally been short-lived.  Over the last 400,000 years, interglacials have lasted about 10,000 years, with climates similar to this one. Before that they were less warm, but lasted slightly longer.  We have already been in an interglacial for about 10,000 years, so we should - according to the pattern - be heading for an ice age. But we are not.  The Epica team has noticed the interglacial period of 400,000 years ago closely matches our own - because the shape of the Earth's orbit was the same then as it is now.  That warm spell lasted a whopping 28,000 years - so ours probably will, too.  "The next ice age is not imminent," said Dr Wolff, "and greenhouse warming makes it even less likely - despite what The Day After Tomorrow says."    Phew. No need to stock up on thermal underpants just yet.

      From DebkaFile :  "Twenty engines used in banned Iraqi SA-2 missiles found in Jordanian scrap-yard with equipment usable for making WMD. In closed-door report to Security Council, UN inspector Perricos also said sites in Iraq known to contain WMD production equipment and materials were cleaned out and destroyed for wholesale export of scrap metal. He urged stopping this export"  It's nowhere on Google news, nowhere on Yahoo, nowhere on AP, nowhere on Reuters... more proof basically exonerating the USA from the 'There Were No WMD's!' horseshit  still  being spewed from the left, and nobody is informed.  It just makes no sense. What the hell is the US administration doing? I can only surmise they're sitting on all the information as it comes in, in a futile hope to acquire a large enough body of evidence to compile one single, weighty report that'll hopefully have enough pages to convince the world that they were right all along. Or they realise that people are intrinsically uninterested in anything less than earth-shattering news, and that waiting to find the Smoking Gun is the only thing that'll swing world opinion. Which seems like a bad idea to me. People  also  tend to have very short memories...

      In other news, world opinion - for once - appears to be backing the Coalition, as everyone and their granny heaps praise on the unanimous adoption of  urlLink Resolution 1546.   Slowly. Very slowly. World opinion  will  change to view the Coalition's defiance of the UN in invading Iraq and finishing what they started over a decade ago, as a good thing. For all the huff and bluster today, future generations will see what we have witnessed this past year as a justice being done, of good prevailing and evil being overcome. Of that, I'm certain. Come June 30, with Iraq in Iraq's hands and little left to cause division among the Allies - instead a common goal uniting them once more (this time the eradication of Islamic Terrorism instead of Nazism and Communism), the day will be marked as the day Islamic fundamentalist terrorism was defeated idealogically. Despite the militias, despite the beheadings, despite the  urlLink failed attempts at using hostages and ransoms  to bully those terrorism deemed 'weak', Iraq will be free. Spain will be remembered for the cowards who abandoned the oppressed Iraqi people this time. And no amount of self-destructive whining from the left can stop it.

       urlLink All about the oil.     Iraq Claims Full Control of Oil Sector   Tue Jun 8, 9:49 AM ET   By KATARINA KRATOVAC, Associated Press Writer   BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqi officials declared Tuesday that the interim government has assumed full control of the country's oil industry ahead of the June 30 handover of sovereignty from the U.S.-led occupation administration.   "Today the most important natural resource has been returned to Iraqis to serve all Iraqis," Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said. "I'm pleased to announce that full sovereignty and full control on oil industry has been handed over to the oil ministry today and to the new Iraqi government as of today."   The announcement came as Allawi and Oil Minister Thamir Ghadbhan toured the al-Doura oil refinery in southern Baghdad.   After meeting and shaking hands with the refinery workers, the two ministers thanked oil sector workers.   "We are totally now in control, there are no more advisers," Ghadbhan said. "We are running the show, the oil policies will be implemented 100 percent by Iraqis."   Allawi said the handover of the oil ministry before June 30 reflects "our full confidence in the oil minister. It's evidence that oil ministry has worked perfectly."   Referring to the former regime of Saddam Hussein (news - web sites), Allawi said that "in the past, Iraqi oil was used in building palaces, buying weapons to achieve one person's goals."   Iraq (news - web sites) has the world's second largest oil reserves, with more than 110 billion barrels of crude oil and about 100,000 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, Allawi said.   A force has been established solely for the protection of the oil infrastructure, made up of about 14,000 guards.     Charles from LGF said it best.. "And in other news, the idiots who continue to insist we went to Iraq to take control of Iraqi oil may now serve themselves a big heaping helping of rancid crow."

      Spotted two things over at LGF today whic piqued my interest.  a) urlLink Missile engines from Saddam's rule found in Netherlands   b) urlLink Radical Islamic terror thoroughly denounced by Saudi ambassador   Regarding a), the evidence slowly mounts supporting the theory that Saddam had WMD's and had the delivery systems to effectively use them, but had the material scattered / exported from Iraq prior to the American invasion. As for b) I'll just say, it's about bloody time moderate Islam took a stance against those radical terrorists doing everything in their power to convince the world that  all  of Islam is still savage. Here's hoping that the few Muslims disagreeing with terrorism as a goal, become many.

"Over the past 10 days, Bush has attempted to link the overthrow of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with the struggle to defeat Nazism in World War II. He even quoted from Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhowers message to U.S., British and Canadian troops on the eve of D-Day during a commencement address last week at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  In their news conference yesterday in Paris, Chirac flatly rejected that comparison.  'History does not repeat itself,' he said. 'It is very difficult to compare historical situations that differ, because history is not repetitive.'"  History does not  repeat itself ? Is he  serious ? That's just about the stupidest thing I've heard uttered from the mouth of a politician  ever .

      It's probably not news to any locals, but Pohamba won the SWAPO party's backing as the enxt presidential candidate. Since it's basically a given that whoever SWAPO's designate is, will win, it looks like he's the next President.  I won't say that it's a bad thing. He's known as a reserved man, not a flaming extremist who calls whites 'snakes' at party gatherings (ala Nujoma)... however, the man is basically a Socialist, whereas Hamutenya was very much a capitalist. Had Hamutenya won it, this country's economy would most assuredly have grown. As it stands, it looks like we're merely in for 'more of the same'. This definately means that land seizures will continue, however.  At least the third guy didn't get it. Angula is one of those types who blame everything, ever, on their 'colonial oppressors.' Meteorites could fall from the sky and eradicate the capital tomorrow, and it would be the Boers' fault.

       urlLink Fodder takes a shot  at me for my Leigh Mathews post.  I've been out of comission for a while with the flu, thus the delayed response. I've commented over at his blog.  What I have issue with particularly :  "But to suggest that the idiots promoting the theory that she had kidnapped herself to spite her parents or for the money were all left-leaners is surely just plain ignorance?"  I'm pretty sure all of those proposing this theory on the forums I used to base my conclusion on, are well-known leftists.  "To suggest that only evil people commit crimes and that nobody is forced into crime  well that smacks of more ignorance."  I don't buy that. To resort to crime in a difficult situation, is weak. Even evil. For as many people who, in bad situations, turn to crime, there are as many, if not more, who choose to find work, or embrace religion, or something along those lines. Adopting crime as a way out makes you a bad person, period. There is always a choice no matter how hard things may seem. Choosing the path of crime, therefore, means choosing the path of evil.  I'll concede some points, such as the generalisation that the Left denies that evil people exist. Sure. But like I stated in my comment, the propensity for 'moderate' leftists to buy cheap tabloid conspiracy trash unquestioningly leads me to believe that the Left majority chooses to rely on emotion over logic, and chooses the comfort of pointing blame at the victims instead of the perpetrators. Yes, I've conversed with some lefties capable of more rational thought, who question the conspiracy theories that their peers lap up, but from my personal experiece they comprise the minority of that particular political segment.  No doubt this will draw flak, but I remain convinced that the ratio of nuts to moderates is far higher within the left-wing, than the right.

      Lies, damn lies, and Moore-stistics.  A member of the Bin-Laden family has strongly refuted  urlLink Moore's accusation of special treatment by the Bush administration  in F9/11. Straight from the horse's mouth:   "I even laughed at times," said Binladin, adding, "but a lot less when he states errors or inaccuracies about my family, knowing perfectly well that he's deceiving the public."  In the film, Moore says President Bush tried to cover up his family's longtime business and personal ties to the family of Osama bin Laden and other prominent Saudis because many of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.  One of his main points is that the U.S. administration helped 142 Saudis - including two dozen members of bin Laden's family - fly out of the United States two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, even though commercial air space was closed.  "That's false and can be verified by anyone," said the Saudi-born Binladin, who intentionally spells his name differently from Osama, the prime suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks. "They benefited from no exceptional authorization to leave American territory."   So, Mr "Binladin" - you state that Moore lied blatantly about Bush buddying up to your ilk and flying them out of the country. If he lied about that - one of the focal points of his 'film' - one wonders what  else  he lied about.

       urlLink "She did nothing to deserve this, she was a gentle soul."   I'm taking this opportunity to emote about a disparaging habit that emerges from certain quarters when tragedies such as the following arise.  Over the past few days, on a couple of South African internet forums, more than merely a few people suggested the theory that Leigh had orchestrated her own kidnapping, in order to get money or attention out of her parents. These people have consequently been proven wrong, and terribly so, when she was found murdered yesterday south of Johannesburg.  This illustrates a glaring fault with some left-leaners. There seems to be a iron belief that when bad things happen, they are not the fault of bad people. Moreso, a belief that bad people -  evil  people - do not exist. The simplest answer - that vile criminals kidnapped Leigh in an attempt to extort money from her wealthy parents, then murdered her in cold blood to prevent her from identifying them - isn't enough, in fact, deep down, it's incomprehensible to them. It disturbs their 'comfort zone', the one where the only evil that exists is The Man. So instead, they don a certain kind of rose-tinted spectacles, one that blinds them from the simple and horrible truth, and rather concoct a wonderful conspiracy theory that helps them find solace in the belief that bad people aren't bad - only  normal  people are. That criminals aren't at fault, but the  situation  is. That the victims had something to do with it. That Leigh was probably a scheming Right-Winger. That the Bushitler planned 9/11, and the CIA assasinated JFK. That the Jews secretly control the world. Etc.  It starts with a simple conpiracy theory, such as Leigh kidnapping herself. It's so easy to believe, so comforting, exciting even - and it's all downhill from there.

       urlLink Filipino hostage released  &nbsp; "A Filipino truck driver held hostage in Iraq for nearly two weeks has been freed, a spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress said Tuesday, a day after the Philippines said it had withdrawn its peacekeepers to meet the kidnappers' demand. "The (United Arab) Emirates embassy has freed the Filipino hostage," said spokesman Haider al Bandar. He could provide no further details. Philippine officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said hostage Angelo dela Cruz had not been seen yet by Philippine diplomats in Baghdad, but that they were checking reports that he may have been dropped off someplace in the city. Militants who snatched the truck driver on July 7 threatened to behead him if the Philippines didn't withdraw all its troops out of Iraq. The Philippines' 51-strong contingent had not been scheduled to leave Iraq until Aug. 20, but pulled out early in order to appease the kidnappers. The last Filipino soldiers left their base on Monday, and headed for Kuwait." &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Looks like the Iraqis are  fed up with the terrorists fouling their name.   "A group of armed, masked Iraqi men threatened Tuesday to kill Jordanian extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi if he does not immediately leave the country, accusing him of murdering innocent Iraqis and defiling the Muslim religion. The threats revealed the deep anger many Iraqis, including insurgent groups, feel toward foreign fighters, whom many consider as illegitimate a presence here as the 160,000 U.S. and other coalition troops.  In a videotape sent to the al-Arabiya television station, a group calling itself the Salvation Movement, questioned how Mr. al-Zarqawi could use Islam to justify the killing of innocent civilians, the targeting of government officials and the kidnapping and beheading of foreigners.  He must leave Iraq immediately, he and his followers and everyone who gives shelter to him and his criminal actions, a man said on the video.  The video marked the first time that an Iraqi group made such a public threat against Mr. al-Zarqawi.  It was issued a day after U.S.-led coalition forces, who have been targeting Mr. al-Zarqawi, launched an air strike in the restive city of Fallujah on a suspected safe house used by his followers. The attack killed 15 people, witnesses said.  In the video, three men, their faces covered with Arab headscarves, were flanked by rocket propelled grenades and an Iraqi flag. The man speaking had a clear Iraqi accent.  We swear to Allah that we have started preparing ... to capture him and his allies or kill them and present them as gift to our people. the man said. This is the last warning. If you don't stop, we will do to you what the coalition forces have failed to do."

      The US DOE and DOD announced today the completion of the removal of  urlLink just over 1.7 tons of enriched uranium from Iraq.   My commentary - is this 'the smoking gun'? Sure, maybe 1.7 tons of uranium doesn't qualify as a WMD itself, but what exactly did Saddam have planned for that much fissile material, considering the Israelis blew up his nuclear power plant all those years ago?  It doesn't take a rocket scientist...

      Kill Bill Vol.2  "..full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."  That would sum up the Kill Bill movies perfectly. Well, at least the sequel.  I really enjoyed Kill Bill 1. It had loads of epic, brilliantly executed and atmospheric action. A simple movie, like all simple, enjoyable movies, it left you wanting more.  Kill Bill 2 was supposed to sate our appetities. Frankly, I was a little dissapointed.  Vol 2 isn't bad - don't get me wrong - but it does't do the original justice. I'd summarise it as drawn out and flat-out boring at times, with some interesting bits and pieces of buttkickery sprawled in here and there to keep you from falling asleep. Good acting performances all-round (particularly Carradine) don't save this movie from turning a great blend of chop-socky kung-fu genius, into another oscar-wannabe overly dramatic bit of ho-hum fare. Even those few fights that take place are completely anti-climactic and compare drastically infavourably to the Crazy-88 Scene from Vol 1.  However, every tale need a finale. If you enjoyed Vol 1, you'll want to see how the story ends, but don't be surprised if you walk out feeling a tad unfulfilled.

      The timeline of WMD discoveries in Iraq, simplified.  Early'ish in the invasion- Empty warheads found containing traces of mustard gas. The Left's response : "It's not proof since there's not enough   actual  mustard gas in the shells to be a threat!" Odd, I wonder what  happened  to the gas that was in those shells.. it was never accounted for by Saddam's regime...  May '04- Warhead found containing sarin in roadside bomb. The Left's response : "It's not proof since it's only one warhead - it's not exactly a  stockpile  or anything!". This same argument used about 2 weeks later when a second IED is found. Only one eh.. Oh wait, make that 'only two'...soo, by that logic, 'only 500' would be quite acceptable as an argument too. Ridiculous.  About a month ago- Banned missile engines found in scrapyards in Netherlands and some M.E countries. The Left's response : "It's not proof because they aren't actually IN Iraq, even though there's incontrovertible proof they are of Iraqi origin." Funny. US troops stationed in Germany are still US, last time I checked. So by leftist 'logic', American fighter jets parked off on a base in, say, Germany, are obviously German.. right?  Less than a week ago- Over a dozen warheads found (there's that  stockpile  ya said didn't exist...), containing sarin and mustard gas. The Left's response : "It's not proof of WMD because...er...some were old and busted... and... well... we've already made up our minds! So there! Anyways it's not like they're NUKES or anything..." This one escapes me completely.  Over the past 6 months, if you add all the warheads and other evidence together, you'd have more than enough to conclude that WMD's existed in Iraq during a time period when they were not supposed to - and that is justification for America's invasion of Iraq. By segmenting the evidence into isolated little pieces, the Left is able to convince the entire gullible  planet  that that specific small segment of prof is not substantial enough. Odd. Last I heard, in a criminal court, a guilty person was convicted on a  body  of evidence. Why is that not the case re: Iraq?

      Just a quick note :  Rumsfeld says warhead s  (notice the pluralisation)  urlLink Found in Iraq very recently by Polish troops.   Rumsfeld: " I was with the Polish minister of defense this weekend in Istanbul, Turkey at the NATO Summit.  And in the course of that, he pointed out that his troops in Iraq had recently come across  Ive forgotten the number, but something like 16 or 17  warheads that contained sarin and mustard gas."  Is this enough, yet, to convince the US's detractors that there were, in fact, WMD's in Iraq?  Somehow I doubt it.

       urlLink Gaffe's aplenty.   What's the difference between this: "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we." and "We will add 40,000 active duty troops  not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations."  The answer is simply, Bush bumbled the former, while Kerry blathered the latter. And of course the former made headlines everywhere, while not so much a  hint  of the latter is to be found in any kind of online or offline popular newsmedia,  anywhere .  What massive liberal media bias?

      And, in other news : prisoner abuse -  urlLink it's our bag, baby.   O, the irony. The  urlLink hypocrisy.  Nujoma and the ruling party had oodles to say about Abu Ghraib and those filthy Amerikans. And yet...   "The National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) released a 163-page 'Namibia Human Rights Report 2004', which chronicles a myriad of persecutions directed by Nujoma and other State agents against perceived political opponents.  Extra-judicial killings, torture, enforced disappearance, abuse of power, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention, attacks on the judiciary and racial discrimination, are but some of the problems which escalated between July 31 2003 and July 31 this year.  "Factual incidents and allegations, as well as situations of human rights violations, reached new levels of frequency and profundity [during the period under review]" NSHR Executive Director Phil ya Nangoloh said.  "Emitted by high-ranking officials, hate expressions was clearly manifest in the numerous verbal and sometimes physical attacks on real or perceived Government and Swapo critics."  At the receiving end of these persecutions, according to the NSHR, were the private media, NGOs, High Court judges, opposition leaders, minority sexual groups, refugees, churches and alleged "supporters of Europeans".  The organisation said that of the 34 total incidents of racial discrimination recorded the Head of State accounted for 10, other senior Government officials also 10, while Swapo and its affiliated unions were jointly held responsible for 11 incidents.  The report also documents seven incidents of torture and other inhuman treatments with the SFF and the Namibian Defence Force (NDF) cited as the main perpetrators.  The NSHR accused Government of having been behind the assassination of Kwanyama border activist, Bernard Nekale Shevanyenga, who was gunned down at Oshikuku village in October.  "We believe that the TAGOMA (The Age of March) leader [Shevanyenga] was executed by State security agents," Ya Nangoloh charged.  The NSHR bemoaned what it termed a dramatic deterioration of the general human rights situation in Namibia over the past year, which it says resulted in grave socio-economic afflictions and rising temperature of political intolerance.  "Spiralling deterioration in the economic and social rights had led to severe social ills such as poverty, ignorance, diseases, homelessness, joblessness and rampant crime which threaten to become a humanitarian disaster," Ya Nangoloh cautioned.  He said that the situation was exacerbated by unsustainable handling of State resources, corruption and a culture of patronage and subservience which afflicts the Namibian society under the Swapo leadership.  With the current state of affairs, the NSHR report said, Namibia will not achieve the United Nations millennium development goals, "let alone the much talked about Vision 2030".  The NSHR, among others, strongly recommended the introduction of systematic teaching of the Constitution as well as educational programmes on human rights principles.  The human rights watchdog also urged the Government to clarify its "present fast-track land reform process and should by all means avoid the catastrophic Zimbabwe-style" seizure of white-owned commercial land."   Hell, even the  urlLink UN has something to say   The dust under the rug's starting to build up...

       urlLink Uri canned,   so much for that.  Another example of glaring Namibian government ineptitude shattering a golden opportunity for this country's timid economy, to smithereens. Although, to be fair, The Namibian police finally placed a large order, but too little too late. Perhaps they finally realised that those massive, expensive, gas-guzzling Chevvies are a patently stupid idea for this country.

      Removed Fodder from the blogroll. I  just fail to see why I should be obliged to  send traffic his way simply because he's one of a rare breed (Southern African blogger) when there's just too much of a personal vendetta/crusade against myself emanating there, with ad-hominem after ad-hominem being launched by himself and his sycophants.  On a side note, perhaps it's a good sign, indicative of a healthy divide/debate (although to fodder & co, debate seems to be defined as primarily taking shots at your opponents' characters... so maybe not  that  healthy) on the relevant issues, instead of everyone unquestioningly believing only one set of 'truths'. Perhaps Southern Africa is maturing to the point where we question things, and try and make up our own minds instead of just 'going with the flow' and, to put forth an example, voting ANC/Swapo/whatever simply 'because everyone else is'.  That's the  first  beartrap Africa has to squirrel it's way out of. Herd mentality.

      A couple of great stories on LGF today.  First, that bunch of mewling whiner musicians using their celebrity status in an attempt to swing the vote,  urlLink aren't getting the response they expected.  Virtually every comment points out the irresponsible stupidity of the whole thing. Heh. Rock on.  And then,  urlLink this story  had me seething.   ''Morales, who is Catholic, was warned about eating pizza with meat the Muslim faith considered "unclean," Local 6 News reported. She was then fired for eating a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, according to the report.   "Are you telling me they fired you because you had something with ham on it?" Local 6 News reporter Mike Holfeld asked.  "Yes," Morales said.    Holfeld asked, "A pizza and a BLT sandwich?"  " Yes," Morales said. ''   Sickening. I hope she successfully sues the hell out of them.

      Worst US president in history?  I'm on a posting spree today, but after stumbling across  urlLink ConservativePunk  , I just  had  to post this :   "Liberals claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war. They complain about his prosecution of it. One liberal recently claimed Bush was the worst president in U.S. history. Let's clear up one point: We didn't start the war on terror. Try to remember, it was started by terrorists BEFORE 9/11.   Let's look at the "worst" president and mismanagement claims.  Lincoln allowed the US to fall into civil war. How would you like a nice Civil war today? You could go and kill your out of state relatives!   FDR led us into World War II. Germany never attacked us: Japan did.  From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost, an average of 112,500 per year.   Truman finished that war and started one in Korea, North Korea never attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost, an average of 18,333 per year.   John F. Kennedy started the Vietnam conflict in 1962. Vietnam never attacked us. I think history might show Eisenhower committed the troops and Kennedy was honoring that commitment. Johnson turned Vietnam into a quagmire. From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives were lost, an average of 5,800 per year.   Clinton went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent, Bosnia never attacked us. He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter three times by Sudan and did nothing. Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions.   In the two years since terrorists attacked us, President Bush has liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Libya, Iran and North Korea without firing a shot, and captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people. We've lost nearly 800 soldiers, an average of 400 a year. Bush did all this abroad while not allowing another terrorist attack at home.   Worst president in history? Come on!"   Right on.

      Kerry : Unfit for Duty?  As usual ,  urlLink Drudge has the exclusive.    "A veterans group seeking to deeply discredit Democrat John Kerry's military service will charge in the new bombshell book UNFIT FOR COMMAND:   Two of John Kerry's three Purple Heart decorations resulted from self-inflicted wounds, not suffered under enemy fire.  All three of Kerry's Purple Hearts were for minor injuries, not requiring a single hour of hospitalization.  A "fanny wound" was the highlight of Kerry's much touted "no man left behind" Bronze Star.  Kerry turned the tragic death of a father and small child in a Vietnamese fishing boat into an act of "heroism" by filing a false report on the incident.  Kerry entered an abandoned Vietnamese village and slaughtered the domestic animals owned by the civilians and burned down their homes with his Zippo lighter.  Kerry's reckless behavior convinced his colleagues that he had to go -- becoming the only Swift Boat veteran to serve only four months.   The Kerry campaign is planning to vigorously counter the charges and will accuse the veteran's groups of being well-financed by a top Bush donor from Texas, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned.  "They hired a goddamn private investigator to dig up trash!" charged a top Kerry adviser traveling with the senator late Tuesday. "This is pay for play, and the dirtiest of all dirty tricks ever played on a candidate for the presidency. How low can they go?"   Kerry supporters are comparing the effort by the veterans to the Arkansas State troopers tell-all against Bill Clinton.  UNFIT FOR COMMAND will not be released until August 15."   Wow. Let's see how the moonbats respond to a little shit being flung the way of  their  boy. After all, what's good for the goose(Bush) is good for the gander(Kerry). Complaints of dirty tricks and Moore-esque low blows from the LLL crowd just  scream  irony.

      Hmmm, I forgot to announce the addition of  urlLink James  to my blogroll. I've known James, to a degree, for a while, and he's always struck me as sensible. It's difficult to find Southern African blogs that don't swing heavily to one side or another, so James' blog is a rare find.  Continuing with the whole ZA/terrorism thing:   urlLink Wayne  makes a poignant observation. The failure with trying to understand Islamic terrorism is trying to fathom the  why . Simply put - sometimes there is no why, sometimes there is no logic. Sometimes religion-fueled psychosis is just that.   urlLink Vaz  also has something to add.

       urlLink Fodder is surprised  by the targeting of South Africa by Islamic terrorists.  I'm not. Pandering to Islamic terrorism has only ever resulted in more of it. Case in point :  urlLink The Phillipines , where a long-dormant Islamic terrorist outfit, revitalised by the Phillipines' government's cowing to to terrorist demands and pulling troops out of Iraq to free a single hostage, has probably doomed hundreds, if not thousands, to death.  S.A. stands for everything the global fundamentalist Islamic terrorist movement despises. Freedom. Secularity. Peace. But S.A. is also weak in terms of resolve. In  urlLink this piece , Lawrence Wright outlines their motives. They want to bring about the apocalypse. They want Judgement Day. What better way to facilitate this than declaring war on those who are afraid of them. Cowards like Spain and the Phillipines are merely stepping stones to creating worldwide fear. They're afraid, and can be influenced, and by targeting nations that Islamic terrorism can 'beat' through bullying tactics, they demonstrate that they, the terrorists, are a power to be reckoned with. And it looks like they've targeted S.A as similiarly cowardly and influencable - another innocent victim to kill, to show to the mighty that they, too, are strong.  If South Africa isn't willing to take up arms against this threat, to support the war on terror, they might just be right.

      victorhanson.com has an excellent piece on  urlLink what's wrong with Fahrenheit 911.   "Countering terrorism has become, beyond any doubt, the top national security priority for the United States. Thus speaks the 9/11 Commission Report, released last week. There is no terrorist threat in this country. This is a lie. This is the biggest lie we've been told. Thus speaks Michael Moore in an October 2002 speech. President Bush has a plan to stop terrorism. Michael Moore does not."

      Fodder continues his  urlLink crusade  against the evil neocon  urlLink vast right wing conspiracy , or at least this particular member.  It's the same argument I've heard time and time again - that it's wrong to generalise re: The Left (odd, how so many of The Left feels so right at home generalising when it comes to The Right. Pot/Kettle black?). Sometimes generalisation can be accurate. He makes an anology about men being boorish misogynistic louts, and that that is incorrect. The irony is, in many circles, we are. Sure, maybe the entire male gender isn't comprised entirely of such specimens, but there are many cultures where such practice is quite standard. Sure, humanity in general isn't a pack of rabid conspiratorial terrorist-backing anti-war hippies. But The Left is. (ahah.)  As for the 'paying ransom=crime' argument, a)that's silly, nitpicking, low and completely out of context(surprise surprise, The Left using out of context arguments, whodathunkit), and b)it didn't help anyways, did it?  Fine. To clarify - those choosing violent crime as a way out = evil. Happy?
