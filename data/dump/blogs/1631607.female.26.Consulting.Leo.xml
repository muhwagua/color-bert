      How many years have we known each other?  It must have been at least 16 years. :) Geez... that's a long time...  They say, friends come and go... but the fact that we stayed with each other for so long... is worth celebrating. Don't you think?

      u mean abt her upcoming ROM? yeah... but if it's something else... then yes, there is ALOT of serious grilling to be done... :P  anywayz... the convention was around since 11 years ago... and seriously, the CEO of the company which organized this convention wasn't THAT impressive... makes one wonder what has he done for the past 11 years... listening to these speakers year after year...  some of the talks were indeed telling u abt money making tactics... however i think the speakers themselves make a whole lot money just by being there at the NAC... u know some of the materials of theirs were going at like $700+ a set? and yes! there were ppl buying the darn tapes... yap... the materials were developed in the days where cassette tapes and PAL/NTSC tapes were the rage... there was this speaker robert g. ellen, kinda advertised his "personal mentorship" program which promised results (read: make millions of $) and the program itself costs $4k... not to mention the so called self study materials u have to buy... in that short 15 mins... i think he would have made easily $400k from the crowd... suckers...  well... i really dunno what to make out of it. it was my first time attending those convention thingy... and i am slightly put off by the hidden agenda that was flying around... not so hidden by any stds... i dunno if i'll go for it again... unless they bring the gurus like anthony robbins and robert kiyosaki... then again, those 2 fellows apparently charge sky high... their seminars are like a few thousand bucks too... sheesh... i seem to be in the wrong line... don't u think?

       Been almost a week since my last post. It's been a busy week... like any other week, but having said that, this week has been special...   I've received the Rites of Acceptance to be a catechumenate in the Catholic Church on 5 July. This is the first rite to signify the Inquirer's decision to become God's disciples and from now on, he or she will follow the Catholic way of life. It's a huge decision, and as I went through the Rites with all the other cathechumenates, I felt strangely touched. It's something that I do not have an explanation for, but it sure signifies another phase of my life... now, it's only how to break the news to my parents... ah well, I'll figure a way out...

       It's been a tiring day. Strange, 'cos nothing much seemed done. Probably another bout of Monday blues...   Finally, I got my first blog up onto the virtual world. Never the sort to write journals, but as I grow older, the act of putting down my tots in words on "paper" seem to be strangely therapeutic. Gone were those days of blabbing to people about the everything, anything. One has to be discreet now... and besides, who is free to listen?   Mood has been wierd the whole day. Mood swings, as people call them. Must be due to the medication I am taking... But ah well, it'll pass...   On the good side, I'm actually home early today. Miss Mum's food... :)   Till then...

       It's been raining the whole day... made a wise choice of working from home! Haha... and hey, I did accomplish something ok? Working from home certainly has its perks sometimes! The only thing is, I've been hogging the broadband modem... (no, I don't have a wireless router) and my poor siblings didn't get to surf the net for the whole day. Which is good for them actually, they can then put the time to better use... :D   Got a notice for me to pick up some stuff from the post office. Wierd people, they always like to send things to my house when no one's around. Anyways, Murphy's at work again, I guess. Just like when you are late for a meeting and somehow all the traffic lights along the road are RED... or when you desperately need a holiday, something MUST come up the last minute...   I'm going on and on and on... rattling nonsense. Some crap show is on TV now, not interested. The TV shows by the local TV station sometimes gets on my nerves... so pretentious... and they can't ACT. Good actors and actresses should get into the role so well, that audience can't feel that they are acting! But *sigh* it doesn't happen here... most of them just stand around and look pretty... Once in a while you get really good acting, but most of the time, it sends my goose pimples into hyperactive mode.   Arghh... my room is in a mess.... I thought I just cleaned it up, now it's back to where it was... what is gong to happen when I have my own house? Die lah, sure get buried in deep piles of paper, books, clothes... what-have-yous... doesn't help when I have a sister who is studying for exams now, all her precious notes lying somewhere... better not throw anything... seem to be running out of storage space too... how ah?

       Strike up the band let it play  Love songs to haunt me and I'll stay  But when it comes to a waltz  Both words and music will ring false   For you waltzed in  And spun my world  Around in dizzy dance  I swirled  But suddenly  You waltzed away from me   Those violins, they must go  So no careless hand with a bow  May play on the strings of my heart  And make me remember how lovers part   How you waltzed in  And spun my world  Around in dizzy dance  I swirled  But suddenly  You waltzed away from me   Strike up the band let it play  Whatever it chooses and I'll say  Play me a waltz if you will  I'll sit here and listen waiting until   My love returns  To take my world  And spin it 'round  In dizzy swirl  Where girl loves boy  And boy loves girl  And feet don't touch the ground   ~~~~ "The Waltz" Silje Nergaard

         You are Form 0,  Phoenix : The Eternal.   "And The Phoenix's cycle had reached zenith, so he consumed himself in fire.  He emerged from his own ashes, to be forever immortal."   Some examples of the Phoenix Form are Quetzalcoatl (Aztec), Shiva (Indian), and Ra-Atum (Egyptian). The Phoenix is associated with the concept of life, the number 0, and the element of fire. His sign is the eclipsed sun.  As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual.  You tend to keep your sense of optomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations.  You have a way of looking at going through life as a journey that you can constantly learn from. Phoenixes are the best friends to have because they cheer people up easily.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Car accidents are such a chore. Darn.  Got into a car accident, but claiming process is a real pain. The accident happened last Thursday, and up till now, I can repair it because the insurance companies have to decide how to claim the insurance and how much the repair cost would be.   Taxi driver's given his side of the story and as usual, he doesn't admit that he is at fault. If people can be more forthcoming, then insurance companies do not have to come up with all these crap about seeing the report and deciding who is at fault, then everything would be smmother, wouldn't it? So much for the independant damage assesment centres. It's not helping the situation AT ALL.  This irresponsible driver has caused me so much inconvenience, and not to mention his own loss of income. Both of us can't work properly cos of our cars, and it really disses me off.

       Someone just told me, Life is beautiful. Indeed, life is beautiful, only if you see beyond the seemingly menacing "facts" of life.  Life is beautiful, if you stop and smell the roses... but with the stress that adults are going through, is it possible?  Children have the most innocent eyes, they see things in the most beautiful way. When can we go back to behave like children? We are all asked to behave like adults, in turn losing that innocence...  Whatever the case is... yes, I still believe Life... is  beautiful ...

Finally got some stuff done, after a week of moping around and procrastination... well.. almost a week. Amost a week of super low productivity.

I'm really glad this week is a much  better  week. Haha. Well, just wish the weeks get better... hehehe...

       Iâ€™m going to ask you to be very honest with yourselves.   How many times have you complain about things the other people are not doing right without taking a step back to look at yourselves?   Did you ever speak badly about other people getting all the limelight after taking the initiative to get things done, conveniently forgetting that when you were given the same opportunity, you didnâ€™t take it up?  How about saying one thing, and doing another?  I can bet, that all of you have such moments. I am not spared from this either. I hate to say this, but most Singaporeans, do not walk their talk.  What exactly is walking your talk? It simply means doing the things that you talk about. Confusing? Not really. Let me show you whyâ€¦  I have seen some parents complaining about how naughty their neighboursâ€™ kids are, how they break everything in sight, how they bully the other children. Yet, their children are not exactly angels. In fact, some of them are worse. Someone I know, who is known for exceptional use of words and ideas, somehow gets on peopleâ€™s nerves, because, he doesnâ€™t seem to practice what he preaches.  Weâ€™ve all been told, what goes around, comes around. We smile at other people, other people will smile back at us. I think in Singapore, we smile at other people, they glare back at you. Like you are some kind of lunatic.  We talk about a gracious society, but are we really one? Take a look at the people going for performances in Esplanade, and the crowd in Sydney Opera House. Over here, audiences are under-dressed, late for shows and even have the audacity to complain about paying full priced tickets and not being able to watch the entire show when being rejected entry to the theatre. Other countries? They observe the rules and are dress to the nines. It is a form of respect, to the performers.  Get the picture?  If everybody starts to walk their talk, wouldnâ€™t we have less misunderstandings or miscommunications? Even less politics? Isnâ€™t that great!

       Just the other day, I saw 2 primary school boys smoking and swearing. Profanities were all over the place.   There was another time, I saw a very young girl (think she is barely 5 years old) shouting â€œI hate you!â€ at her own mother.  How many times have we seen children behaving like little rascals? Worse when you find their parents to be the grown up versions of their children?   I was brought up in an environment where we were told to be respectful, courteous, and considerate. My parents believe that you have to teach the right values when the children are young by setting the examples. Pretty much like the Chinese proverb, ä¸Šæ¢ä¸æ­£ä¸‹æ¢æ­ªï¼Œif the upper beam is crooked, the lower beam will not be straight. Children, after all, have impressionable minds.  Let me share my experience with you. When I was coaching part time in a neighbourhood secondary school during university days, I made it a point to be there 10 or 15 mins early to ensure that things are in order. My players however, seem to like wasting my time, always strolling in 5 or 10 mins late, sometimes, more than half an hour. They were like a bunch of monkeys, ill-disciplined and inconsiderate. I had a hard time pulling the kids together, especially the 15 yr olds. Being their coach, I had the chance to speak to some of their parents and there was this striking resemblance, which was unfortunately, not limited to the looks. You know, someone once said, â€œFor rarely are sons similar to their fathers; most are worse, and a few, are better than their fathers.â€ I think itâ€™s quite true.  I tried all ways, from scolding to persuading to denying them the chance to represent their school, in order to instill discipline. I had to resort to strict ground rules. One of the rules I had, was that they have to apologise to everyone if they were late. Likewise, MC has to be produced if they are sick.   I remember a girl who was giving me particularly more problems than the rest of the girls. She was one of the better players, yet she would either turn up late, or go missing in action. After the rules were set, she was missing for 1 week and when she came back, she was late. In fact, she sashayed in 45 minutes into the training session. Obviously, I waited for her MC and apologies but she didnâ€™t produce any of those. I was pretty irritated by then. The conversation then went something like this:  Me: Why are you late?  Her: Overslept.  Me: What happened to u last week? Her: Sick. Me: Havenâ€™t you forgotten something? Whereâ€™s your MC? Her: What?  Me: Didnâ€™t I say if you are sick, you need to give me your MC and if you are late, you have to apologise to the team? She kept quiet and stared defiantly at me. Furious, I lashed out.  Me: Where is the basic courtesy? Donâ€™t you have my number? Why didnâ€™t you call me? Why do you think I give my number to you? For fun? If you know you canâ€™t wake up in the mornings, you jolly well go to bed earlier the night before! If you are not interested to come on time, why should I waste my time and everybody elseâ€™s time to go through what Iâ€™ve taught again? Since you want to behave like a princess, you can go home now. I donâ€™t need a princess in the team.  With that I turned back to the rest of the team and continued coaching. She shouted from behind, saying that I was being biased and she was not in the wrong. I couldnâ€™t be bothered. The rest of the players suddenly behaved more like human beings. Guess what? The following week, she was early! In fact, everyone was there earlier than I was! She apologized to me sheepishly saying that after thinking about it, she realised I was right and she decided to be punctual for all the trainings.  Be it parents, mentors, teachers, or friends, we are all influential people in some ways, believe it or not. It is very important to set an example and to lead by example, whether you like it or not.  I have seen parents with children in tow, jumping restaurant queues, being rude to elderly and punctuate every sentence with a profanity, sometimes a whole string of them. Imagine how the kids will grow up to be! A friend, who incidentally is a discipline master in a school, smokes like a chimney, gets drunk every weekend and does the most absurd things.   In summary, children and in fact, every single one of us pick up things very fast especially the not so good ones. We should try and set good examples for the people around us. A gracious society? Or a malicious environment? Iâ€™ll leave it to you to decide for yourselves.

       â€œAiyo, Jillian, how come u look like an auntie when u are only so young? For goodnessâ€™ sake, wear some make up la!â€  This was what a MALE customer of mine said to me one day.   And I found out that he has got better tips on personal grooming than any of my girlfriends. Ouch!  Gone are the days when the desire to look good and smell good is solely a womanâ€™s privilege. Gone are the days when spas, beauty and slimming salons are out of bounds to the men out there. Gone are the days when only the fairer sex contributes more to the beauty industry in the pursuit of ultimate beauty.  In this day and age, the quest for good looks is part and parcel of everyoneâ€™s lives. Men included. The male preoccupation for aesthetic harmony, is now  COMPARABLE  to that of women.  Social conventions traditionally have it that women should be more concerned about their appearances than men. But hey... think about it for a while. Do you know that male displays of vanity dated back to the days of Narcissus?  For many years, Japanese men have been going to salons, getting their eyebrows neaten, their pores cleaned and their hands manicured.   Just 5 years ago, men in the other parts of the world would have squirmed at the mere thought of stepping into a salon.   Nowadays, the trend has swept the rest of the worldâ€™s male population by whirlwind and has given rise to a brand new species: the metrosexual.  The term â€œmetrosexualâ€ was actually invented by Mark Simpson, a British writer. It describes an urban male with a strong aesthetic sense who spends a great deal of time and money on his appearance and lifestyle and is NOT afraid to embrace his feminine side.  An epitome of the metrosexual is none other than the famous footballer, David Beckham, sexual scandals aside, who has been known to paint his fingernails.    Even in the local scene, our very own comedian Mark Lee has gone through multiple facial peels, to smoothen his orange peel like skin. Kumar? He's definitely in touch and embracing his feminine side. *grin*  This is not only happening to the rich and famous, my customer for one, spends his free time working out and going for facials, shopping and making sure he slaps on his trusted moisturizer on a quotidian basis.  Until recently, the male grooming market was just about shaving creams and toothpaste. But at the end of the last century, fashion and cosmetics brands started to capitalize on metrosexuality to break into the menâ€™s market.   Jean Paul Gaultier, who was one of the first to go into the industry, lauched a product line for men and within 6 months after the launch, more than 500,000 items were sold!  And listen to this!  In a survey done by the British retail chain Superdrug, women are asked to identify annoying habits of their husbands or boyfriends.  More than 3 quarter of the participants say that they hate it when their man swipe their beauty products, ranking it a  BIGGER  sin than leaving the toilet seats up.  In a recent FHM survey done in Wales, a total of 67 % of total men under 40 now use a moisturizer, 76 % use a blemish concealer and 85% admitted to spending more than 45 pounds a month on skincare!   Goodness! Thatâ€™s even more than what I spend on grooming myself! Can't believe men are getting more and more vain these days.  In France, for instance, the growth of menâ€™s beauty products  OVER-PERFORMED  the whole market, with an average increase on 7% from 1997 to 2001. In 2003 alone, menâ€™s cosmetic products counted for 10.5% of the whole French market.  In Singapore, more and more beauty salons are coming up with programs for the urban male and they are also making a huge impact in the way that the Singapore Man sees personal grooming.  With more men working in the services industries and having occupations where personal appearance has become a key success factor, it is hardly surprising isnâ€™t it?   At the end of the day, men are moving away from the traditional idea of â€œthe closer you resemble monkeys, the more manly you areâ€. In my humble opinion, men are the new women, and this idea is here to stay.   Oh and by the way, I donâ€™t really look that bad, do I?

         You are a human shadow.  If a loved one needs you, you are always right at his or her heels! Your deep social connection with human beings produces your qualities of genuine caring and charisma.  However, at times you are naive to the true nature of your loved ones.  Remember that humans' gift of free will does not always lead them in wise directions.  But your essence of love and friendship represent the other precious gifts of humanity. Overall you are a strikingly valuable and innocent being who has a lot to give.(please rate my quiz cuz it took me for freaking ever to create)    urlLink   What Kind of Shadow Are You?

       It used to be this way.   Doors wide open, children running in and out of the house, chasing after cackling hens, laughing merrily.   Women chatting in the open air kitchen, with the aroma of freshly cooked dinner filling the air, occasionally yelling at the one or 2 children who messed up the place.   Men sat by the table drinking ice cold beer, talking about the work day that just passed. That sheer warmth and joy of feeling freeâ€¦ that sense of community.  Nobody worried about anything...  That was simplicity. That was innocence. That, was life. But somewhere down the line, life changed.   People sealed up their homes and replaced the warm home with a cold house.   People stopped smiling at others and when they talk, they talk behind othersâ€™ backs.   The world suddenly became more dangerous. Unkind thoughts sneaked into our minds. The sense of community eroded and things became complicated.  Slowly, people started to feel the difference and tried to make up for the difference by filling their lives with more activity. Planning, organizing, goal-settingâ€¦ and then, stress crept in.   People became so stressed out, that life would whiz past them, without them even knowing.   Emptiness became like a black hole. It just kept sucking life out of them, never returning a single cent.  Title chase became a norm, and soon people were â€œkillingâ€ each other, over the search for power, and money.   After that title chasing, tiredness overcame people, and some shrewd businessmen came up with the idea of stress management.   The businessmen built beautiful resorts and came up with fancy stress management tactics like reflexology and spas.   They painted pictures of flowing water, soothing sounds and beautiful sunsets to people.   They created that vision which many looked forward to. It was a paradise. And the people were sold to that idea of a paradise.   The price, however, was not cheap. Therefore, people went into the vicious cycle of finding more money to find more calm. Greed took over and people became slaves to money.  It became a status symbol, to buy that lifestyle that was once available to them. The lifestyle that was innocent, charming and full of laughter. What an irony!  The things that people took for granted, became a luxury. People lost sight of who they really were. People lost track of what life was all about.   One fine day, they came to the end of their lives, and realized with a rude shock that their lives were nothing and have full of regrets.  If any of those things strike home for you, itâ€™s time to take stock, and go back to the basics.   Before I end, I just have something for you. In Buddhist monasteries, it was the cookâ€™s duty to make the most sumptuous meal possible out of whatever ingredients that was available, rather than complaining about what he didnâ€™t have.   Life, is what happens to you, when you are busy making other plans.

       Hehehe... was reading tech news and came across this article in www.asiacomputerweekly.com.  Gates said at the annual CEO summit:"What blogging and these notifications are about is that you make it very easy to write something that you can think of, like an email, but it goes up onto a web site... [blogging is about] gettng away fro the drawbacks of email, that it's too imposing, and the drawbacks of a web site, that you don't know if there's something new and interesting there."  In the same article, it has been implied that in future, businesses may be using blogs are a communication tool, somewhat similar to user groups and BBS... Microsoft at the moment, doesn't have any such products/tools... the market is going to be interesting... for bloggers like us... :)

       Woh... found out that 2 of my friends are pregnant over the last 2 days... guess this is the "IN" thing now, when we are all about that "getting hitched and child bearing" age...  Incidentally, I saw 2 very different scenarios in the 2 friends' pregnancy. One is constantly taken care of her mum refuse to let her go out at night alone), absolutely under heaps of TLC and very happy... the other, under alot of stress, which was coming from employer (which could be taken up to HR actually) and as well as her doctor... she has to be closely monitored due to health reasons.   Father Almighty, it is in Your Plan, that they are bestowed with child... I pray for them to be healthy, and have an easy time during pregnancy. This prayer also goes out to all the mums-to-be... In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen...

       I've been confined 12 days already. Not because of anything, but I am down with the horribly infectious... chicken pox!  Always wonder how one contract chicken pox. You know the symptoms... achy body (for me, it was a back that almost broke at the lower lumbar), headache accompanied by fever (mine was in and out of the 39 degrees celsius range and I thought it was going to give me permanent brain damage...), and rashes that start coming out like beansprouts. I read somewhere, that especially for people with immunodeficiency, this pox can be quite complicated in young infants and adults.   I really hated being down and out with chicken pox... it is like... itchy and sweaty... haha... praise that Lord that I went to see the doctor in time for him to prescribe some medication to suppress the outbreak, otherwise I would probably be in super low spirits...  Anyway, I'm almost recovering... would be back to work on Monday... hehe...
