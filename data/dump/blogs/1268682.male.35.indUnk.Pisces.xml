       urlLink Rilo Kiley, "The Execution Of All Things"   Hannah Nefler grows up...   By Byron Schaller, Delicious Media contributor  In 1989, Jenny Lewis fell into America’s hearts as the daughter of Phyllis and Freddy Nefler in  urlLink "Troop Beverly Hills."  Nine years later she did it again. Except this time she is fronting her new group, Rilo Kiley.  Rilo Kiley has been categorized many ways (alt-country, indie pop, indie rock), but none of them really sum up what this foursome is really about. The band did not release their first album, 2001’s “Take Offs and Landings,” until three years after they formed. This record was release on Barsuk Records. Jenny would later go onto sing the female parts on label mate Ben Gibbard’s 2003 collaboration with DNTEL, The Postal Service. In 2003 they released their second offering, “The Execution of All Things,” on Saddle Creek Records, located in Omaha, NE. Jenny even gives a small shout-out to the new label in the title track with the line: “Then we'll go to Omaha to work and exploit the booming music scene and humility.”  Anyone who has never heard Rilo Kiley before and expects the same sweet girl they saw in "Troop Beverly Hills" is in for a big surprise. The lyrics are dark and brooding with a lighter poppy back drop. Jenny grew up. In the title track she is not talking about execution as in “doing”, she is talking about mass genocide of everything, and does so in a disarming way. The music is intelligent, thought provoking and above all else, enjoyable to listen to. The melodies are catchy and the rhythms bounce along. So much so you will find yourself humming about death and destruction and everyone else will think “My, what a lovely tune.”   The album is full of great tracks. Starting off with “The Good That Won’t Come Out” and continuing on for the next two tracks with “Paint’s Peeling” and the title track. “Hail to Whatever You Found in the Sunlight” and “Three Hopeful Thoughts are also quite good. You’ll find many unexpected things as you listen as well. From orchestral instruments and pedal steel guitar to a full choir, the music is a constant surprise. Jenny’s bouts of Tourettes Syndrome may come as quite a shock too. She is not afraid to say “fuck this” and “fuck that” as often as she wants. It almost gives the songs a grittier tone, and I mean that in a good way.  “The Execution of All Things” is a great follow up to their debut. They really overcome the sometimes fatal “sophomore slump.” If you have not heard these indie darlings I suggest you change that. I have not seen them yet, but I also hear that they are a powerhouse live. Jenny Lewis and company hit one out of the park.    Byron Schaller is a guest contributor for Delicious Media. He mantains his own blog,  urlLink In The Congo,  enjoys writing, collecting records, and watching Italian horror film. He is a Hoosier, but looks nothing like Gene Hackman.

       urlLink John Wesley Harding, "Adam's Apple"   The return of gangsta folk      Naming yourself after a Bob Dylan album, well, that’s just asking for it. Nobody could accuse Harding (nee Wesley Stace) of being a Dylan soundalike…sure, there’s some Dylanesque threads in his neo-folkie sound, and early songs like “Red Rose and the Briar” are reminiscent of Bob’s epic narrative style, but what really got the critics in a lather in the late eighties (when Wes, as he will be known for the remainder of this review, began making albums) was his similarity to another guy who drastically changed his name: Elvis Costello.   It wasn’t just the quasi-punk, British-accented vocals and wry, caustic lyrics that brought on these comparisons. Wes upped the ante considerably by hiring Bruce Thomas and Pete Thomas – Elvis’ famed rhythm section – for his full-length debut studio album, “Here Comes the Groom.”  I’ll admit, I got caught up in the hype. I first heard Wes in 1990 while listening to Joe Reiling’s sadly now-defunct “no playlists allowed” show on Armed Forces Radio. The song was “The Devil in Me,” a hilarious, horn-spiked blast of fresh air with a heaping helping of old-school Hammond organ. Within a couple of weeks (this was pre-Amazon, and I was stationed quite literally in the middle of nowhere), “Here Comes the Groom” was mine. I still consider it one of my all-time favorite albums by anyone.   Wes eventually left Sire Records (home to Madonna and Talking Heads, among others) and appeared on a number of independent labels, all the while continuing to crank out what he calls “gangsta folk” and establishing himself as a hugely entertaining live act.   Wes’ latest, “Adam’s Apple,” was originally slated for a 2002 release (under the title “The Man With No Shadow”), but his label at the time (Mammoth Records) folded, and he was left with a bunch of songs and nobody to release them. Along came the small independent label DRT, who released “Adam’s Apple” in February 2004.   Was it worth the wait? Of course. Wes’ catalog has been peppered with largely acoustic, often live recordings, in addition to a covers album (“Trad. Arr. Jones”) and a few EPs (“The Garden of Eden,” “God Made Me Do It: The Christmas EP”). A good, full band album reminiscent of both “Here Comes the Groom” and 2000’s overlooked “The Confessions of St. Ace” could be just the thing to get Wes the commercial push he deserves – but I’m not holding my breath (I call “Confessions…” an overlooked album, but it does in fact contain the closest thing he’s ever had to a bona fide hit: “I’m Wrong About Everything” was featured in the soundtrack to “High Fidelity”).  If you’ve only seen Wes in concert and not heard his studio recordings, you’d think his music was overtly folk with little concessions to full band recordings, but “Adam’s Apple” is gorgeous studio power-pop of the highest order. Songs like “Nothing At All” and “It Stays” contain aching hooks and engaging instrumentation, often featuring lots of tasty Hammond organ. There’s a nice combination of upbeat stuff and slower ballads – the raucous “She Never Talks” (the only song I’ve ever heard to name-check the Strauss opera “Die Fledermaus”) sits comfortably alongside gentle numbers like “Sleeper Awake.”  As always, the Wes wit is alive and well in songs like “Sluts,” where brash backing vocals and a funky backbeat support a darkly comic commentary on materialistic, all-night club-hopping yuppies (“We’re sluts, the two of us/Why walk, when we can get the bus/Why get the bus, when we can cab it/Living large is our best habit”). “Protest Protest Protest” is a playful jab at protest singers, where Wes sarcastically complains to today’s crop that there’s nothing to protest about these days (“that negative attitude will get you nowhere”).  On the other end of the spectrum, there’s the dark, beautifully orchestrated “Sussex Ghost Story,” co-written by modern classical composer Gavin Bryars. The song, about an acquitted wife killer who gets what’s coming to him thanks to wife number two, ends with the line “I begged for my life.” Not exactly Hillary Duff material.  If you took Billy Bragg, subtracted the overt political statements, added a healthy dose of Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, John Prine and a little Dylan for good measure, you’d have a general idea as to the sound of John Wesley Harding. And if you buy this disc, you’ll make the guy some money. And he deserves it.    Note: much of Wes’ back catalog was out of  print for some time, but many of his earlier albums have been reissued recently. “Here Comes the Groom” and its follow-up, “The Name Above the Title” are now available as a reasonably priced set; “Awake,” “John Wesley Harding’s New Deal” and “Why We Fight” have also been reissued recently as well. These are all excellent albums, worthy of your hard-earned money. And don’t forget to see Wes perform live if he makes it out to your neck of the woods: he’s extremely entertaining on stage.

       urlLink Broken Social Scene, "You Forgot It In People"   Come on feel the noise      One of the most accurate things I can state with any certainty regarding Broken Social Scene's "You Forgot It In People" is that the album's title is inscrutable as the music contained inside.   And, to quote everyone's favorite jailed domestic diva, that's a good thing.  A Canadian "music collective" formed in 1999 by Kevin Drew (of K.C. Accidental) and Brendan Canning (of By Divine Right), I had never heard of BSS before picking up this disc. The band's (um, sorry, "music collective's")  modus operandi  is all over the map. It's as if some highly eclectic bar band of egghead college students performed "rock music history" set to shuffle mode.   The cover, with its dark, muddy black & white photo of the band in the middle of what appears to be a sweaty club gig, is misleading. I was expecting a thrashy blend of indie punk, and while there certainly is some of that here, when I first hit "play," the results were refreshingly more diverse. The opening track, "Capture the Flag," kicks everything off with ambient keyboards before a rising, intrusive trumpet barges in, signaling the beginning of the album proper.   This is the first major gear shift. The second track, "KC Accidental," is - make no mistake - heavily influenced by prog rock (by way of some D.I.Y. punk). The swooping melody and galloping rhythms suggest Yes as a bar band (as fronted by the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne). Gears shift once again on track three, the heavily New Order-influenced "Stars and Sons." It should be noted (before I carelessly forget) that Sonic Youth's sound is all over this album as well. And so on. I doubt Blogger's bandwidth can handle the list of influnces these guys absorb.   There's lots of noise on "You Forgot It In People," giving the album an unpolished feel, but never compromising the band's commitment to aching hooks. Like Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot," there's plenty of distorted effects, random feedback, and "found objects" that give the listener plenty to chew on, keeping it infinitely listenable. It's one of those albums (again, like "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot") that you could listen to a hundred times and still discover something new.   There's a refreshing down-to-earth quality throughout. "Looks Like the Sun" lumbers along in sunny, acoustic beauty, while the singer (being a true "collective," the liner notes don't credit who exactly plays what) can be heard calling out chord changes between lines, in addition to various other instructions ("keep it going"). Let's try Britney do that (once she learns what a "chord" is).   The band employs sing-songy, idiosyncratic, nursery rhyme-like lyrics ("Anthems For a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl"), wah-wah guitar reminiscent of Ween's "A Tear For Eddie" ("Shampoo Suicide") and even tropical-influenced instrumentals ("Pacific Theme"). And that's just for starters.   There doesn't seem to be a game plan to "You Forgot It In People," just a need to create, experiment, and keep the music flowing. Even within the alleged originality and vitality of indie rock, Broken Social Scene finds new ways to keep it fresh.

       urlLink The Holmes Brothers, "Simple Truths"   God made them funky      The Holmes Brothers have been cooking up their unique brew of blues, gospel and funk for more than 20 years, even though I've only heard them for three. 2001 was something of a comeback year for the guys, even they hadn't really gone anywhere. A chance meeting with Joan Osborne after one of their New York City gigs led to a contract with the blues label Alligator, and the Osborne-produced "Speaking in Tongues" was the result.   Not only are Sherman Holmes, Wendell Holmes and Popsy Dixon accomplished musicians, they also sing their asses off. With Joan in the control room, the boys churned out an album's worth of exciting original material, along with an inspired array of cover songs (including songs by Bob Dylan, Ben Harper and the O'Jays).   Three years later, can Sherman, Wendell and Popsy continue the momentum? The answer is a resounding "yes," and then some. "Simple Truths" is arguably stronger than its predecessor, as if the critical success of "Speaking in Tongues" inspired them to push even harder. First of all, the original material is better than ever. Wendell's "We Meet, We Part, We Remember" is easily my favorite song on the album, with an easygoing yet gritty soulfulness that sounds like a R&B chesnut from thirty years ago.   The covers are eclectic and well-chosen: "Shine," the somewhat forgettable mid-nineties alt-rock staple from Collective Soul is given new life as a high-energy gospel stomper. Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" manages to sound gleeful and sad at the same time (Wendell's deft guitar solo is part of the song's charm). They don't exactly break any new ground with their version of Bruce Channel's one-hit-wonder "Hey Baby," but the acoustic guitar-driven arrangement and the emotional singing raise the song to a higher level.   The sound is hard to describe, but its appeal is simple. A little Blind Boys of Alabama, a smattering of Bo Diddley, and just enough Wilson Pickett to give it the right amount of soul. These are all qualities sadly lacking in an era of remixes and Pro Tools. Get back to your roots and get funky with the Holmes Brothers.

        urlLink Skinny Puppy - The Greater Wrong Of The Right    A kinder, gentler puppy   By Tom Johnson, Delicious Media Contributor  It's not so difficult to imagine Skinny Puppy continuing to exist through the mid-90s - most of the solo output of the members has sounded more like Skinny Puppy than the band's own "final" album,  The Process , actually did.   After Dwayne Goettel died of an overdose, the band finished up that album and released it to a world that was rapidly growing sick of the industrial sound. While the album maintained much of the attitude and fury SP was known for, they had begun to absorb more mainstream sounds - guitars were featured heavily and song structures veered more toward standard rock than ever before.    While guitars had been a part of the mixture, they had never been so prominent, not even on the very "rock"  Rabies  (which featured the influence of Ministry's Al Jourgensen).  The Process  failed to satisfy many fans - which is unfortunate because what's good on the album is pretty  great  - but what's not . . . isn't.    The members of Skinny Puppy disbanded, but the  sound  continued on as Download - named after a cacophonous Skinny Puppy track from the seminal  Last Rites . The first two albums as Download,  Furnace  and  The Eyes Of Stanley Pain  along with their accompanying EPs,  Microscopic  and  Sidewinder , respectively, picked up where Skinny Puppy had failed to pick up with  The Process , incorporating SP's penchant for intriguing sounds and angular structures with touches of techno.    Later Download albums would explore the techno end of music more as they shed the identity of being Skinny Puppy Part II.  In the meantime, on various other side projects, the Skinny Puppy sound still continued - you can't blame them for seemingly being unable to get away from sound they helped pioneer. Ogre's project Ohgr was really a more pop-oriented Skinny Puppy, and his  other  project, the (so far) one-off Rx, with the legendary drummer Martin Atkins was akin to what Skinny Puppy might sound like with less reliance on keyboards and computers - I always liken this to "acoustic industrial."    It came as a pleasant surprise to hear that Skinny Puppy had reformed for a reunion concert, which was documented on  Doomsday: Back and Forth, Volume 5 , and only a slightly more shocking surprise to hear that a new album was in the works.  The Greater Wrong Of The Right  brings Ogre and Key back into the fold with new member Mark Walk.  But is is  really  Skinny Puppy?  A quick answer that those less familiar with SP might offer is an undoubtable yes. For those who've surrounded themselves with their music, you might have a hard time swallowing some of this as "really" Skinny Puppy.   On initial listen, it's obvious the band has been very influenced by much of the edgier mainstream rock - I can't help but think the band really, really likes something as unlikely (for them) as Linkin Park because opening tracks "I'mmortal" and "Pro-test," the latter of which features Ogre  rapping , of all things - and don't overlook the inclusion of Static-x vocalist Wayne Static on "Use Less," which also features Tool drummer Danny Carey.  But you know what?  It  works .   I was initially taken aback by the new, more mainstream attitude of Skinny Puppy, but once the shock wears off after a few listens, this is an engaging, satisfying album. Putting aside the notions of just what Skinny Puppy "should" be reveals that it's possible to continue on with a legendary name and not sully the name and image.  They've rightly chosen to follow the vein that  The Process  started, but they've wisely managed to steer clear of that album's disappointments.  Where  The Process  felt like a forced reaction to the light, radio-friendly pop that industrial had become in the wake of the massive success of Nine Inch Nails,  The Greater Wrong Of The Right  feels more like a natural progression - at least  from  the startling changes of  The Process .    Skinny Puppy die-hards will likely balk at the new, "easier" sound, but those who can look beyond this will find an album that is much more satisfying and enjoyable than one might expect.   Tom Johnson likes corn, but only if it's popped. Accomplishments include being crowned "belch king" for the first half of 6th grade.  He also enjoys writing his own bios.

        urlLink Morrissey, "You Are The Quarry"    Manchester's favorite son makes the world safe for moping again      It's safe to say that you either love or hate this guy. There are people out there (some of them I know personally) who would give their right arm for a front-row seat at a Morrissey show, rushing the stage, hugging him and probably giving him a bouquet of flowers. Consequently there are also people who will see the image above this paragraph and roll their eyes in frustration. "Not  him  again..."  While I wouldn't sacrifice any limbs or rush any stages in his honor, I have to say in all honesty that I'm a pretty big fan. I loved the Smiths when I was in high school and began buying all the full-length solo albums, starting with the wonderful "Viva Hate" in 1988.   Morrissey's solo career has had an interesting trajectory: "Viva Hate" won critical raves and was a smash with the fans; 1991's "Kill Uncle" was a true sophomore slump, getting so-so reviews and containing, in my opinion, about three decent songs; 1992's "Your Arsenal" was a bright, vibrant, glam/rockabilly return to form; and 1994's  moody "Vauxhall and I" was a brilliant exercise in dynamics.   After that, things get hazy for me. I passed on the two follow-up albums, "Southpaw Grammar" and "Maladjusted," mainly due to the bad reviews and indifference from even the most hardcore fans. Had the Moz' music really run its course?   It's amazing what seven years can do to a guy. That's how long it's been since "Maladjusted" limped onto the music scene. Since then, Morrissey moved to California, went a little grey around those ever-present sideburns, and generally stayed off the radar. That is, until now. "You Are The Quarry" is Moz in the New Millennium.   Has he learned anything in those seven years? Not that I can tell, if the music is any indication. In other words, if you like Morrissey, you'll love this album. This is him, pulling no punches and making no compromises. The day the album was released (this Tuesday), I asked Dave, our music supervisor at Borders, what "You Are The Quarry" sounded like (I had yet to hear it myself). "It sounds like Morrissey," he explained. Nothing wrong with that!  The old piss and vinegar is intact, and comes out immediately. Really. The album's first song, "America is Not the World" starts with the line, "America, your head is too big." The staunch vegetarian also adds that the U.S. not only invented the hamburger, but also suggests a place where they can stick the invention. So much for mellowing with age.   Alan Whyte and Boz Boorer, guitarists and co-songwriters who've been with Morrissey for about 15 years, provide fresh, vital instrumentation, complete with chiming guitars and occasional crunchy distortion. Keyboards are also a bit more in the mix than past albums, but never to a distracting degree. There's some slight nods to current technology, but it all fits.   Piano and strings even come out for "Come Back to Camden," a beautiful, sentimental love letter to England that shows that you can take Moz out of England, but not England out of the Moz. "Under slate-grey Victorian skies," Morrissey croons, and it's a quintessential Morrissey line. Without the sarcasm.   Jabs at self-loving celebrity airheads are certainly welcome in this age of Britney Spears and reality television, and they get their due in "The World Is Full of Crashing Bores," which has great lyrics, but is made even better by the anthemic, almost majestic quality of the music. Oh, and have I mentioned that Morrissey's voice sounds better than ever?    If you're looking for a new Morrissey, one who may have given up on being bitter or sarcastic (or coming up with song titles like "I Have Forgiven Jesus"), you won't find a new guy here. It's the one you know and love (or hate). But with a few new suits in the closet.

       urlLink J. Geils Band, "Love Stinks"   Boston's white boy funksters straddle a line      Some people say “change is good,” while most people rightfully decry the concept of “change for the sake of change.” I’d like to think that  Love Stinks,  the J. Geils Bands’ 1980 official entry into new-wave credibility, fits the former maxim and not the latter.   At the dawn of the Reagan era, it would have been easy to dismiss this album as a sell-out, but it’s also entirely possible that Boston’s own white boy soul men ran their blues angle into the ground and were looking for a fresh sound. A “fresh sound” is certainly what listeners got when they dropped the needle onto the opening track, “Just Can’t Wait.” Keening synthesizers drive the song along, and vocalist/frontman Peter Wolf’s lusty pleas are egged on by guitarits J. Geils’ beautiful, hook-laden guitar solo. This is clearly a band with recharged batteries.   Not that the band’s old sound was anything to scoff at. Since their beginnings in the late 60s, Wolf, Geils, keyboard player Seth Justman, bass player Danny Klein, drummer Stephen Jo Bladd and the wonderfully named blues harp master Magic Dick forged a unique blend of bluesy swagger and party funk. Concert favorites like the self-explanatory “Detroit Breakdown” and their rousing covers of a variety of obscure blues chestnuts like “Serves You Right To Suffer” coexisted happily with the reggae-pop of “Give It To Me” and the hit ballad “Must of Got Lost.” It was almost as if new wave party anthems were just one more format these guys needed to master.   Obscure covers haven’t been abandoned with the new sound, though. Their version of the Strangeloves’ “Night Time” is here, and boy, does it cook – they sound like a young hungry bar band while tearing through this party starter.   Revisiting this album for the first time in many years (I picked up the CD last night), I was struck by how well it’s held up. Sure, the synths reach a sort of cheesy fever pitch during the second song (the discofied “Come Back,” a pure retro guilty pleasure in all its Jordache splendor), but that’s also what we love about Gary Numan’s “Cars.” If you want loud guitars and attitude, why not try the title track? Those of you only familiar with Adam Sandler’s “Wedding Singer” version (which I’ll admit, my ambivalent feelings towards Sandler aside, is pretty funny) will be pleasantly surprised at the energy and vitality of the original version. And while the title track’s guitar riff is a blatant rip-off of “Wild Thing,” you can’t deny its impact, or that of “Takin’ You Down,” another potent rocker on this long-forgotten album.    Love Stinks  only deviates from the party atmosphere twice: “Desire” is the album’s sole ballad (and one that will perhaps grow on me, but in the meantime is a track I normally skip over), and “No Anchovies, Please,” is a hilarious skit that shows the boys have a sense of humor underneath all that boogie bluster.    Love Stinks  was a local smash in Boston and on national rock radio, while serving as a springboard for what would be their biggest smash yet, 1981’s  Freeze Frame  (which would contain their only #1 pop hit, “Centerfold”). By the time that album was released, Justman pushed the band to a technology-obsessed critical mass, which had its moments, but for most fans (myself included) stepped over the line. Eventually Wolf left the band, they made one god-awful album without him, and promptly broke up.    Love Stinks  shows Boston’s  other  bad boys straddling the line between snotty R&B bar band and cutting-edge pop nirvana the only way they can – with a whole lot of attitude.

       urlLink Terence Trent D’Arby, “Wildcard”   Gone, forgotten, but still breathing      Conceit never seems to be a smart career move in the music business, and Terence Trent D’Arby has spent the last 15 years learning that the hard way.  In 1987, the New York City-born R&B singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist blasted onto the music scene with an impressive debut album,  Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D’Arby.  A mixture of pop, funk, and smart urban melody, the album yielded a #1 pop hit, “Wishing Well,” along with two more successful singles, “If You Let Me Stay” and “Sign Your Name.” D’Arby was all over the place.   Unfortunately, so was his ego. Once the original huzzahs began to die down, the press (and subsequently, the music-buying public) latched on to D’Arby’s overconfident pronouncements regarding everything from his musical talent (he referred to his debut album as “better than  Sgt. Pepper ") to his sexual prowess (“I make love more often than I wash my hair,” he once boasted, which seems to say more about his lack of follicle hygiene than anything else). And so the backlash and apathy began.   When artists don’t deserve our attention in the first place, backlashes are excusable (think Milli Vanilli). But D’Arby’s debut album was an impressive collection of fiery funk, and his voice – evoking a modern-day Sam Cooke – a breathtaking instrument of emotion. No matter. Apparently, when you diss  Sgt. Pepper,  you’re off the guest list.   D’Arby twisted the knife even further in 1989 with his sophomore effort,  Neither Fish Nor Flesh,  a sprawling, dissonant, gospel-tinged emotional masterpiece. Regardless of its occasional critical acclaim (it’s a fantastic, if uneven, album),  Fish  tanked.   Subsequent attempts to revive his career (with excellent and rather accessible works like  Symphony or Damn  and  Vibrator ) proved fruitless and D’Arby eventually fell back on his “Wishing Well” royalties and a life of sporadic artistic output and minor cult status. Somewhere along the way, he moved to Italy and changed his name to Sananda Maitreya (really). Fame may do strange things to people, but not nearly as much as a fall from fame.   I have no idea if D’Arby has any more interest in reclaiming his original heights of popularity and success (I doubt it), but his latest,  Wildcard,  could be a significant contribution to such an effort.   It’s certainly not as experimental as albums like  Neither Fish Nor Flesh.  It’s funky, street-smart, and very much a piece of danceable, 21st century R&B. Nods to retro – old-school soul horns, wah-wah guitar, charming psychedelia – all are over the place, as are contemporary synth sounds, peppering the album with modern relevance (without ever sounding pandering or like an old fart trying to keep up). Drum machines are a dominant presence as well, but they merely provide a pulse and never seem to overtake the music.   D’Arby’s voice is still a mighty force to be reckoned with and has not lost an ounce of its original potency. “Fundamentally sound / my karma’s coming ‘round / and I’m not worried,” his gentle voice croons over a banjo(!) accompaniment at the very beginning of the opening track, “O Divina.” Before long, drums and horns kick in and the familiar soulful shout is there.   It’s easy to make comparisons between D’Arby and another funky oddball with a strange career path – Prince. They both have an awkward public image, are notorious control freaks, play most if not all of their instruments, and constantly straddle the line between funk and hard rock, not to mention the sacred and the profane (and of course, the name change thing). Like the Purple one, sex and relationships dominate much of the lyrical content. But instead of boasting like a modern-day Don Juan, D’Arby often reflects on getting screwed over – in more ways than one. “I once loved her / now I’m paying the bill,” he sings on the excellent “Designated Fool,” D’Arby’s ode to a love-‘em-and-leave-‘em ex. “My baby’s gone suga free / she ain’t sweet like she used to be,” goes the chorus of “Suga Free.” He still has a way with a killer line, too. The sexy, swaggering  “SRR-636” contains the unforgettable “like a Rolling Stone / I jam with a Woody.”  Elsewhere, D’Arby sings of self-confidence and positive energy, in an almost treacly Dr. Phil way. “If you’re not good to yourself,” he warns on “The Inner Scream,” “your self-doubt becomes retribution.” He still hasn’t lost his penchant for the occasional flowery spoken word moment, either. But these drifts into navel-gazing are few and far between, and besides, would you rather have the overconfident boasting of the 80s?   Listening to  Wildcard,  I can’t help thinking that there’s really nothing on this extremely strong album that would make the average listener either recoil in horror or shrug in apathy. What’s continuing to keep D’Arby off the radar (besides his expatriate status) are various statements and attitudes he made back in the Reagan administration, which were obviously a) the result of a kid in his mid-twenties, unfamiliar with effectively playing the media, and b) not worth the scorn he continues to be subjected to in 2004.   But D’Arby himself seems to have made peace with his erratic past, and is in a warm, but no less creative and funky place. “Goodbye Diane” is obviously a touching break-up song, but one can’t help thinking that the opening line is a nod to the early phase of his career: “Once upon a time I said some pretty fucked-up things.”

       urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   I’m fine with out you…   By Byron Schaller, Delicious Media contributor     Charlie Kaufman has a masterful understanding of the human mind, and even more importantly, how to translate the mind’s workings into a screenplay. We saw this first in 1999 comedy “Being John Malkovich” where Kaufman explored the ability to crawl inside the head of the famous actor. He continued to shape his art in 2002’s “Adaptation” where we find him navigating his mind as himself trying to write the very movie we are watching. This maze cinema approach and physiological insight reach their peak with his latest work, “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”.   The work done by everyone in this film is nothing short of stellar. Jim Carrey proves once and for all that he is a very proficient dramatic actor. He gives a fantastic performance as Joel Barish a quiet and introverted man whose mind becomes the backdrop for most of the film. Kate Winslet also gives a great performance as Clementine, Barish’s ill fate love. Tom Wilkinson gives the level of performance we have come to expect after such a great performance in 2001’s “In the Bedroom” as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak. Elijah Wood manages to separate himself quite well from the role of Frodo Baggins as plays a morally devoid technician named Patrick, and  Kirsten Dunst rises above the normal flighty teen shtick she is know for as Dr. Mierzwiak’s receptionist Mary.   The film’s main focus is on one of our most human characteristics, our memories, and how they define us, challenge us, and control us. The film supposes that there is a procedure that can erase something from a person’s memory completely, leaving them as if it had never happened. The movie itself in follows a nonlinear timeline and takes place both in the real world and Joel’s mind. The transitions are clear and easy to follow and don’t disrupt the telling of the story at all. In fact it enhances it.   The special effects inside Joel’s head are fantastic. From easy “Blair Witch” style flashlight and camera work to surreal effects like jumping between memories and having things disappear out of nowhere the special effects accent the story and in most cases the scenery very well. The idea of being in someone’s head has never looked better.    The most important part of the film, aside from its cinematic brilliance is its message. As painful as memories can be at the end of a relationship, especially a bad one, is it better to remember, because as painful as it maybe at the time, you will always have the good memories and those are priceless. On top of that it goes further to ask if you know how something is going to end, and it is bad, would you still do it? These are important observations and questions that strike at the core of the human condition.  This film is moving and inspiring and may change how you view your own life. Such and important movie should not be missed. Make sure to see it, preferably with someone you love. And don’t forget about it come awards time, you are sure to see there as well.

He is a Hoosier, but looks nothing like Gene Hackman.

       urlLink  Greg Kot, "Wilco: Learning How To Die"    Picking apart the legend of Jeff Tweedy     Rock bios are generally full of sex, drugs and rock & roll -- unless they're about Wilco. Here we have virtually no sex, not much drug taking (apart from some early tales of alcohol and a relatively insubstantial painkiller addiction), but plenty of rock & roll. And in the end, isn't that what it's all about?  Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot lays out the story of Wilco in this detailed, informative biography. Actually, it's more the story of Jeff Tweedy than anyone else. Born and raised in the southern Illinois town of Belleville, Jeff met singer/guitarist/fellow music nut Jay Farrar in junior high school and eventually formed a band, the Primitives, with him. Their sound was deeply rooted in American country and folk, but fused with the raw power and nihilism of punk rock. Think Johnny Cash meets Black Flag.   Kot's book takes the reader through the Primitives' days and nights living in shithole apartments and playing shithole clubs. Eventually the Primitives become Uncle Tupelo and gain and even larger following, resulting in recording sessions, contracts, albums, tours -- making it it out of Belleville and beyond. The band recorded three critically hailed albums and virtually spawned the "alt-country" genre, but Farrar left the band suddenly, forcing Tweedy to reconstruct under the name Wilco. Farrar's follow-up band, Son Volt, gained the initial upper hand (their debut album,  Trace , fared much better than Wilco's debut,  A.M. ), but Tweedy, determined to push Wilco unto more and more adventurous territory, had the last laugh.   Despite  A.M. 's mediocre performance with fans and critics, Tweedy pushed ahead with the sprawling, ambitious  Being There  (he deferred a good deal of his songwriting royalties in order for the album to be released as a double CD at no extra cost to the customer), followed it up with the twisted studio wizardry of  Summerteeth  (aided in large part to Wilco's latest secret weapon, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett) and became a cautionary tale for boat-rockers everywhere with the dense, difficult, beautiful, and briefly unreleasable  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.   Almost everyone with a passing interest in contemporary rock music over the last three years knows the story behind that album. Tweedy, Bennett, utility player Leroy Bach, bassist John Stirratt and drummer Glenn Kotche pushed the envelope about as far as it would go, creating beds of noise and dramatic arrangements for the gorgeous songs of YHF. Their label, Warner/Reprise, wouldn't accept it, Wilco took the album to the smaller, more adventurous Nonesuch Records, it received boatloads of acclaim, and now Wilco are the coolest kids in the school while Warner Brothers come off as clueless corporate suits.   This isn't the first time Wilco was snubbed by execs. When  Summerteeth  was brought to the record company in late 1998, the powers-that-be complained that there was no "hit" to extract from the album. Hotshot producer David Kahne was asked to help mix "I Can't Stand It," in an effort to beef it up for airplay. Of course, airplay never followed. Wilco on the radio, as delightful a prospect as that is for discriminating music fans, carries the same probability as Philip Glass on a reality TV show.   Kot tells the story in amazing detail, drawing from an exhausting pool of interview subjects (it seems as though everyone involved in Wilco's history was interviewed). The book isn't merely a linear telling of how the band got together and went on to prosperity; a good deal of music-business politics is discussed and dissected as well.   Whenever speaking of Wilco and its history, it's always crucial to note how they've become symbolic of music business bullshit and how genuinely talented artists fall victim to almighty dollar. Tweedy is a singer, a songwriter, a musician, but certainly not a corporate ass kisser. He didn't get into music for the money and makes that fact clear throughout the book. Kot constantly hammers home the point that once upon a time, record companies were interested in artist  development,  whereas now it's just a matter of who can score a hit. Here today, gone tomorrow. No wonder one-hit-wonders are more popular today than ever before.   Tweedy's fickle nature with band members is also evident in Wilco's history. Kot does a good job of remaining objective, and although you get the stories from all sides, and Tweedy basically seems like a nice guy, you can't help feeling that the myriad personnel changes in Uncle Tupelo and Wilco may have something to do with Tweedy's stubborn nature in dealing with people who fly in the face of his overall musical vision. Guitarist Bob Egan was gradually phased out with little sympathy, as was outspoken drummer Ken Coomer (replaced by Kotche after Tweedy was introduced to him by noise-rock guru Jim O'Rourke, who would end up having a huge effect on Tweedy's musical experimantalism). Jay Bennett's dismissal from the band in 2001 was not only acrimonious, it was a substantial subplot of "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart," Sam Jones' 2002 documentary on the making of YHF.   Reading interviews with Bennett, Tweedy and the rest of the band members, in addition to hearing Kot telling the story from the beginning, it's easy to see how Bennett's studio domineering and general head games got in the way of the band. Was Tweedy feeling threatened? Perhaps. Was Bennett nudging Tweedy out of the spotlight? Maybe. But as difficult as it is for a Tweedy fan like myself to admit, Bennett's prowess as both as a musician and a studio engineer were crucial to YHF's sound. The band may be happier, but  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  is a peak that they may never surpass.   This is indeed a great story about a musician who loves music, and will compromise nothing for his vision. Fans of Wilco and Uncle Tupelo will be in heaven. Casual fans who just want a good story about making music on your own terms will learn a few lessons. Readers looking for stories about groupies, heroin addiction and dressing room debauchery will have to look elsewhere.

       urlLink  The Tragically Hip, "In Between Evolution"    An offering from our neighbors to the North   By Tom Johnson, Delicious Media Contributor  Canada's  other  big musical offering (besides Rush, not to mention Neil Young), the Tragically Hip, have been turning out high-quality rock for nearly two decades now. A staple in their homeland, the Hip is hardly known in the US. Their latest effort,  In Between Evolution , seems to be a concerted effort to break through to a little more exposure in the states. Unfortunately, as with most efforts to break through, it suffers from a few flaws. Minor as they may be, it's unfortunate to see a band struggling to get attention.  Explaining that the Hip deserve the attention should be unnecessary - but as with all things truly good, it generally misses the attention of the public at large who seem to need things more watered down and generalized.    The problem with  In Between Evolution  is that it sounds, in a way, like two separate pieces - a short section of "different" material (for the Tragically Hip, at least) followed up by a too-short album of traditional Hip material. The album kicks off in high gear with the raw, almost-punk energy of "Heaven Is A Better Place Today," singer Gord Downie straining to reach the upper echelons of his vocal range. In some respects, it's as if the Hip made a conscious effort to resurrect a bit of the "hard rock" sound they shed after their first couple of albums  Up To Here  and  Road Apples  - with mixed results. It's not as if these first three songs are  bad  songs - they just seem to lack some of the heart this band pours into their music. There's an odd transition between "Gus The Polar Bear From Central Park" and "Vaccination Scar" that illustrates the change that happened in the band between the classic  Day For Night  and the follow-up  Trouble At The Henhouse  - from a  rock  band with thoughtful lyrics to a thoughtful band that happens to  rock . Between tracks three and four, the tempos change, the attitude changes, the song structures change, and that's a good thing - I don't think I would have gotten that much out of an entire album filled with that many out-and-out rockers, to be honest. What I've come to love with the Hip is an ability to straddle folk-rock and hard rock, favoring just slightly the folk-side of things due to Downie's intriguing, oft-humorous, but always thoughtful lyrics.    Maybe the blame lays with producer Adam Kasper - known most significantly for his work with the Foo Fighters' last two albums, both of which possessed a decidedly harder edge than their predecessors. Throughout the album the guitars are turned up loud, panned hard left and right, drowning out Downie's voice that floats right down the center of the soundstage. I find myself straining often to make out what Gord is singing - a shame with lyrics as impressive as his always are.  This is likely a purposeful effect to play down the band's true signature, Downie's trademark tuneful, choked warbling. It's no secret that the Hip have struggled to take off in the US while enjoying massive success in their homeland. Where the Hip are basically Canada's answer to Pearl Jam, in the States the Hip have barely made a dent in the market. The band frequently sells out arenas at home, but it's nothing unusual to find them playing small clubs stateside. When I've played the Hip for the unitiated it's always been Downie's soft barkings that draw the most comments. "You get used to it," I say frequently, but I don't believe it - I've  always  enjoyed Gord's voice and have never understood how it turns people off.  What is there to "get used to?" Gord's slightly nasal delivery is no less characteristic than Michael Stipe's voice, yet it  somehow manages to stand out just enough to throw off newcomers.  Perhaps it's because it's unfamiliar and unusual - when it comes to the unfamiliar and unusual it appears that US listeners are most hesitant. American audiences need their rock  verified  - maybe we got burned on too much meaningless, throwaway rock the labels threw at us for so long, who knows.  All I can say is that before most Americans can commit to something, we need to know the music is good by seeing it endorsing commercials, backing action sequences and love scenes in movies, or hawked at the end of meaningless teen dramas.  Without that, sorry guys, we just can't determine if it's any good.  (But we have no problem downloading mp3 after mp3 of pop pablum.  We've got no issues spending hours downloading the latest sound-alike tune from Nickelback - they did, afterall, have a track in  Spiderman  a couple years back. But parting with our hard-earned cash for something that might be  different  sounding?  No way, we're not having it.)  The identity issues evident early on in the album are erased quickly with multiple listens as the album finds its own groove and pacing. I probably won't ever be able to hear it as a single, solid piece, but upon inspection, I can't find a better place for the three oddballs on the album than right up front - get 'em out of the way so they don't throw off a good flow later on.  Placing them at the end would blow the emotional closer, another Hip trademark. Regardless of whether it's an up-tempo or down-tempo number, the Tragically Hip has managed to end on a note of beauty with a track that always leaves you wanting more. "Goodnight Josephine" is no different. An upbeat ballad of sorts to a young girl lost, as far as I can tell, in the distractions of teenage life, dating, and maybe abuse, "Goodnight Josephine" somehow manages to beat the odds its subject matter might impose on other bands to actually wind up sounding hopeful. And that's the thing that really keeps the Hip from making it in the US. There's nary a song in their catalog about suffering, hurting others, drowning sorrows - if you haven't been paying attention to what sells today, these are sure-fire hit material. If the American music-buying public can't openly sulk to their purchases, it has no place in their collections. Downie writes not out of a need to heal his own scars, but in hopes of getting everyone else see the good and the beauty that's out there.  That's too bad - it's hard to place happy, thoughtful songs in movies with lots of explosions and over-emotive teens. We just can't get enough of that crap.   Tom Johnson likes corn, but only if it's popped. Accomplishments include being crowned "belch king" for the first half of 6th grade. He also enjoys writing his own bios.

       a programming note   As you may have noticed, Delicious Media has been a little light on content lately. I'm still very much interested in maintaining this site; however, my "real" job has been much busier and it's getting rather difficult for me to get a decent wireless signal at my house when I use my girlfriend's iBook. So blogging in general has been somewhat neglectful on my part, and I apologize. My priority in terms of blogging has always been my main blog,  urlLink pressure drop,  and I would be doing a disservice by throwing half-ass reviews up here. I will do everything I can to get reviews of the following items on Delicious Media  this week:   Mike Keneally Band, "Dog" (the long-awaited new album from one of my favorite singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalists; expect lots of superlatives)  Wilco, "A Ghost is Born" (another long-awaited one: Jeff Tweedy and the boys get even weirder, but more "organic")  The Decemberists, "Her Majesty the Decemberists" (a new "favorite band" for me, and a great new album with a unique sound. Me likes)  Greg Kot, "Learning How To Die" (speaking of Wilco, this is a great new book about the band, which traces back to Tweedy's humble Illinois beginnings, through Uncle Tupelo and the current incarnation of Wilco. Good stuff)  All this week. Check it out.

        urlLink "Solaris"  and  urlLink "Solaris"     Two brilliant directors take on Stanislaw Lem       Tarkovsky or Soderbergh? That's the question I was asking myself last night while settling into bed for a good night's sleep, the perfect end to a lazy holiday weekend.   Monday afternoon, while Liza was earning holiday pay at Borders, I sat on my porch and read  urlLink "The Dogs of Riga"  until it got too cold, did some laundry and watched my two latest  urlLink Netflix  acquisitions, Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film  urlLink "Solaris"  (based on the Stanislaw Lem science ficion novel) and Steven Soderbergh's own 2002 version of  urlLink "Solaris".  I enjoyed them both a great deal, and although the purist in me hates to admit it...I have to say that the more recent version was more interesting to me.   This isn't altogether surprising; after all, Soderbergh is a brilliant, fascinating, unique director. In my opinion, the Coen Brothers are the only contemporary filmmakers who are in the same league (and, if you ask me, they've been slipping a bit lately). Soderbergh's  urlLink "Out of Sight"  and  urlLink "Traffic"  are among my favorite films of the last ten years. So if anyone's going to do a remake, why not bring in the best of the best?  Tarkovsky is a director (I should say "was" -- he died in 1986) of whom I've heard great things, but have never seen anything from until yesterday. His groundbreaking   urlLink "Andrei Rublev"  is considered one of the finest Soviet films ever made, mired in controversy due to Cold War-era restrictions and sitting on the proverbial shelf from 1966 until its release in 1971. Anyone who gathers accolades, controversy and DVD releases from   urlLink Criterion  deserves my attention.  So I watched the 1972 film. The cinematography is lush, bright, and manages to convey brilliantly both the beauty of nature (in its initial scenes) and the cold, clinical settings of outer space. An obvious comparison can be made between this film and  urlLink "2001: a Space Odyssey"  (which Tarkovsky reportedly hated for its "coldness"), and like Kubrick, Tarkovsky revels in long, ponderous shots that take their time, allowing the viewer to soak in the settings. Call him the Anti-Tarantino.   Like the novel, the 1972 version of "Solaris" (and its 2002 counterpart) concerns a space station orbiting the planet Solaris, whose astronauts have been cosmically freaked out by strange goings-on. Psychologist Kris Kelvin is sent to the space station to check things out. There's a lot of exposition -- a bit too much, in my opinion -- prior to Kelvin's blast-off. When he arrives, Kelvin finds that the two remaining crew members (not counting the one who committed suicide) are being visited by characters from their past. Kelvin is apparently not immune to these bizarre events...his long-dead wife appears as well.   The story is an interesting one, and Tarkovsky makes a lot of noise about love, loss, and our existence in general. I enjoyed the sights and sounds of the film, but it almost seemed too idiosyncratic for its own good. It's hard for me to put this in context with the rest of Tarkovsky's work since I haven't seen any of it yet. The shortcomings of this otherwise satisfactory film make me want to explore more of his work ("Andrei Rublev" is on my Netflix cue).      Soderbergh admits that his film is not a remake of Tarkovsky's, but rather another interpretation of Lem's novel. Fair enough. Almost from the beginning, it seems as if it's on a different wavelength as the 1972 film. Kelvin (played excellently here by George Clooney) is shown in the opening scenes as dark, depressed and moody (his wife committed suicide several years prior), but is told of the failed Solaris mission and is whisked off almost immediately. There he finds -- like in the original film -- freaked-out crew members, their long-dead friends and family, and -- of course -- his long-dead wife.   Unlike Tarkovsky's version, Soderbergh chooses to focus on Kelvin's attempt to hang on to this apparition that poses as his wife, in an attempt to repair the broken relationship and make amends (he feels responsible for her suicide). He's deluded, of course; his wife is dead and is no longer real. While concentrating on the relationship may illicit groans from purists and give the film "chick flick" appeal, there's really nothing wrongheaded with taking this approach. It gives the science fiction genre a humanistic element sorely lacking in an age of robots and special effects. Beneath the hum of space station machinery, there lurks a cerebral, caring film.     I wholeheartedly recommend both versions of "Solaris," while leaning a bit more on the 2002 version. But keep in mind that these are not whiz-bang special effects-laden movies. If you're willing to sit back and enjoy an interesting story that takes its time and looks great (and also  sounds  great - the modern-sounding score in Soderbergh's version is brilliant), you're in for a nice ride. Two of them, in fact.

       in the land of strip malls    In the parlance of today's war correspondents, I'm currently "embedded" in Phoenix, Arizona. Liza and I are visiting her family here for a few days, in addition to attending the wedding of one of her friends. This is the fourth time I've been to Phoenix since Liza and I started dating three years ago and I'm still struck by how different this part of the country is from Boston. And it's not just the temperatures. All the streets are designed in grids. Everyone has cars (and lots of trucks) and public transportation barely exists. I'm a long way from home. But I'm having fun. At the moment, Liza and I are babysitting her sister's two kids. We just watched "Ice Age." Earlier I fed six-month-old Jadan. Did I mention how far from home I am?   Speaking of Phoenix, this fair city's own Tom Johnson (one of my favorite bloggers and a generally righteous dude) posted a great little op-ed about the joy of discovering remastered CDs on  urlLink his website.  Check it out.   My flight out here went reatively well. I've isolated my fear of flying to turbulence. Everything else is fine. I'm over my immense fear of terrorist hijackers and the whole take-off thing is under control as well. But you'd think that with all of our advances in modern technology that we could make aircraft impervious to all that damn shaking during "choppy air." It drives me up the wall. Fortunately, the second leg of our trip (Chicago to Phoenix) was smooth enough for me to start enjoying "A Cure For Gravity," the quasi-autobiography of Joe Jackson. If you're a fan of JJ (as I am), you should read this book. If you're a musician, you shoud read this book. Very well-written, very funny and quite enlightening.    So tonight, Liza's parents are taking us to the Phoenix Fish Market. We went there last time I was in town and I absolutely loved it. Then I believe a dip in their hot tub is in the works. Boy, do I love being on vacation.

       im all about the free music   Some people do downloadable MP3s. Me, I have a part-time job at Borders, so the way I get my music  gratis  is by putting my name on whatever promo CDs that happen to roll into our music department.  Its not easy. You have to be quick. Also, I only work there part-time, so my chances of getting a choice title are greatly diminished. Fortunately, I have a healthy appetite for classical music, and most of the people who work there couldnt be bothered. I did, however, score two very nice non-classical discs this week.   One of them is a  urlLink compilation  by an R&B singer named Johnny Adams. Johnny was a relatively obscure singer who hit his prime in the 1960s. He scored some R&B hits but the closest he ever came to pop stardom was a minor 1969 hit called Reconsider Me. He died in 1998 at age 66. I discovered Reconsider Me about 13 years ago as a Navy disc jockey working for Armed Forces Radio and Television. Doing a weekly oldies show, I was going through some of our old compilation records and discovered this amazing ballad, which I subsequently played several times during my tour there. Johnnys style is much like Wilson Picketts, but with a slightly heavier emphasis on ballads. Anyway, this disc is really something. Theres a couple of ill-advised genre experiments (courtesy of whatever hip producer was manipulating him at the time, I suppose), but overall its a very strong collection.  I also scored the wonderful new two-disc deluxe edition reissue of John Coltranes  urlLink "A Love Supreme"  One of my co-workers, Nate, handed it to me the other day, saying, Do you want this? I dont think Im going to get around to listening to it. I wanted to kiss him (well, not really, but). I first purchased an inferior version in 1992, and when the next reissue came out a few years ago, I inexplicably passed on it. Then this two-disc version comes out (which includes a live interpretation of the cycle). Then Nate  gives  me a copy. There are many reasons why Nathan Hobart is a great guy. This is merely one of them. A Love Supreme is one of those jazz albums that is constantly referred to as a watershed in the annals of jazz music. And its probably because its a masterpiece, with Coltrane leading a fierce group of musicians through some of the most inspired music of his all-too-short career.

       "he's so good he makes you want to spit"   (XTC's Andy Partridge, describing Mike Keneally)   One of the things I like best about having this blog is being able to spotlight people whose work I enjoy but who unfortunately just dont get the recognition they deserve. You may remember earlier this month that I wrote a piece on  urlLink Paul Weller.  I consider Paul an obscure artist in the United States, but stillanyone with an above average knowledge of the history of rock and roll knows who this guy is. It doesnt matter if youre a Vespa-driving mod from London or an indie record store clerk from Omaha. Chances are, if youve got a big record collection, youve heard of the guy.  Well okay, geniusheres a name to throw your way:  urlLink Mike Keneally.  If you know me and my musical tastes, or if youve spent an inordinate amount of time on this site (ha ha), the name may ring a bell. But the average joe is pretty clueless as to Mikes identity. Why is that? Well, hes not on a big record label and his music is damn near impossible to categorize. His music is definitely not for everyone, but Im always surprised at the variety of people who hear his music and find something to latch on to. His stuff is complicated, a little psychotic, dark, breezy, catchy, hilarious, breathtaking, and optimistic. Sometimes all in the same song.   Mike was born in 1961 and was raised on a healthy diet of his older sisters Beatles records (listening to them, not eating them). In 1966 he began playing keyboards, and about five years later, after hearing the music of  urlLink Frank Zappa  for the first time, he took up the guitar. Now I cant speak for Mike, but Id hazard a guess that hearing Zappas music and picking up a guitar were two incredibly significant moments in his life. I myself first heard Zappas music at the tender age of 13, courtesy of my older brother. I must admit that what initially attracted me to Zappas work was his scatological lyrics (hey, I was in junior high school), but as I got older and developed more of an appreciation for music, Franks musical talent really pulled me in. I used to think that Sheik Yerbouti was the most entertaining Zappa album ever made; now Im obsessed with The Yellow Shark, Civilization Phaze III and other more sophisticated, musically challenging works (although Broken Hearts are for Assholes can still put a smile on my face 20 years later).     So back to Mikeafter spending 1971 through 1985 doing what he calls rampant musical experimentation: recording, composing, band-forming and dissolving, learning, he formed a band in San Diego called Drop Control, which achieved cult status in that town. It was during his tenure in Drop Control that he somehow developed  cojones  of steel and called Zappas office in the hopes of getting an audition to play with Frank on his 1988 world tour. One thing led to another and he landed the highly sought-after gig as Franks stunt guitarist, in addition to playing keyboards and singing (some of his best-known vocal work during that tour was his impersonation of Johnny Cash, which Frank directed him to perform at random segments of the show; Mike contends that the impersonation sounds more like Mister Ed).   The 1988 tour put Mike on the musical respectability map. A tenure with Zappa may not make you a millionaire, but it will get you noticed by other musicians. Just ask Adrian Belew, George Duke, Terry Bozzio, Jean-Luc Ponty, Steve Vai, Captain Beefheart and countless others  they all garnered name recognition and went on to bigger and better things thanks to Frank.   After the 1988 tour self-destructed in June of that year, Mike went off on his own and eventually recorded and released his first solo album, hat. Mikes 1992 debut is an extremely low-budget affair, and the best thing about it is that there are no rules. Really. This is one big blob of exhilarating, no-holds-barred musicianship. Its obvious by listening to this album (and subsequent ones) that Mike is having a blast. The production quality at times lends itself to a demo, albeit a massively well-performed demo.   Mike followed hat. with the dark, dense Boil That Dust Speck (Frank Zappa and Mikes father both passed away during the making of this album). While the album definitely has its playful side (in songs like Good Morning, Sometime and Faithful Axe), there are lots of dark, angry moods evidenced in songs like Cause of Breakfast, Weekend and Bullys (sic).  After the live-in-the-studio, live-on-stage Half-Alive in Hollywood, the pristinely produced but no less dangerous Sluggo! followed, which could have given Mike his first bona fide hit with Potato, if radio programmers would open their ears and minds. Songs like Potato and Afraid were definite commercial contenders, but you couldnt say the same for whacked-out masterpieces like I Guess Ill Peanut and Egg Zooming.    Not comfortable with staying put in one specific musical mindset, Mikes next album was 1999s Nonkertompf, easily the quirkiest and most experimental thing hes ever done  and thats saying a lot. All instrumental with everything played by Mike himself, this is an amazing adventure of an album. Keneallys done some stuff that sounds vaguely commercial, but none of it can be found here. The best way to listen to this one is on headphones with the lights off. Really.   In 2000, Mike abandoned the one-man-show work ethic of Nonkertompf (for the time being) and brought in his usual musical cohorts, collectively known as Beer For Dolphins: bass player Bryan Beller, drummer Jason Harrison Smith, guitarist Rick Musallam, trumpet player Chris Opperman, percussionist Tricia Williams (now Steel) and keyboard player Marc Ziegenhagen. These guys (and gal) will collectively kick your musical ass six ways to Sunday. This full-band sound produced the freewheeling, optimistic yet mind-blowingly musical album known as Dancing. The XTC-like power pop Live in Japan lives happily next to the soulful electric-piano-laced ballad Joe, while They Might Be Giants seems to invade the spirit of the instrumental The Mystery Music. Theres also the improvisational insanity of The Brown Triangles and the Radiohead-meets-Stone Temple Pilots angst of Ankle Bracelet. This is one insane collection of songs. But theres something for everybody.   Mike stepped back into solitude with his next release, the quiet, acoustic Wooden Smoke, which I happen to feel is his strongest work yet. The mostly instrumental album contains some deadly musical chops, but is also hypnotic, meditative, and some of the most gorgeous music youll ever hear on an acoustic guitar. I think that deciding on your favorite Keneally album really depends on your mood  theyre all so different  but if I had to choose my favorite, Wooden Smoke would be the one. Read the  urlLink review  I wrote on the apparently now-defunct website Killer Flamingo.     Currently Mike is touring Europe, and has spent a good deal of the last six months writing and performing songs that will likely appear on his next album (the tentative title is Dr. Dog, we are led to believe). He recently retired the Beer For Dolphins band moniker, and a stripped-down four-piece outfit known as the Mike Keneally Band has been ripping the heads off serious music fans on and off for the past year and a half. This band  featuring Beller, Musallam and drummer Nick DVirgilio  understands Mikes music and the skill, dedication and sheer fun involved in performing it. If you ever get the chance to see Mike perform, drop everything and do so. I have never seen anyone come away from a Keneally show disappointed. If you do happen to catch a show, be sure and say hello to this unusually friendly, charming musician.   Mikes stuff isnt easy to find in retail stores (but not unheard of); your best bet is probably the internet. Try Mikes website. Also, if youre into the whole tape-trading thing, there are scads of Keneally shows available  urlLink right here.  Keneally uber-fan and general nice guy Ron Spiegelhalter runs this site and does a damn fine job of it. Dive right in, but be sure to follow the rules.   There. You know the story. Now go out and buy this stuff already.

       the oscarmath   I absolutely tanked in the office Oscar pool. We voted on nine categories -- I correctly predicted a whopping three (best picture, best actress and best supporting actress). But it's not my fault! Really! There were many surprises. For one thing, "The Pianist" came up with three major wins -- best adapted screenplay, best director, and perhaps the biggest surprise of the night -- best actor. Although my money (literally) was on Scorcese nabbing best director and Daniel Day-Lewis taking home the best actor trophy, I was extremely happy to see "The Pianist" win those awards. Brody was amazing and Polanski, who is easily one of my top ten favorite directors, was finally rewarded for his stellar work behind the camera.   Can I just get this whole Michael Moore thing off my chest? Please? I'll try to be brief. First of all, I admire Moore as a filmmaker. Although I didn't see "Bowling for Columbine," I'm a big fan of his 1988 documentary, "Roger & Me." I have lots of respect for his left-leaning anti-war, taking-care-of-the-working-people agenda. More power to him. But his bitter, clumsy tirade at the Oscars last night was completely ridiculous. It was the televised equivalent of farting at the dinner table. I'm all for freedom of speech, but by stomping all over his alloted time, he wasn't able to eloquently put into words what were obviously strong feelings against Bush and the war in Iraq. As much as I am for people stating their opinions, I have to say that with all the madness going on in the world right now, I was looking forward to a few hours of no war and a few cheesy musical numbers and Hollywood self-congratulation. That's what it's all about on Oscar night. Am I wrong? Oh, and if you are going to make a plea for peace, then do just that. Look at Chris Cooper. When he received his best supporting actor award, he was all class. He thanked the appropriate people and made a brief plea for a quick resolution to the conflict. Ta da! That's all there is to it. Susan Sarandon gave the crowd the peace symbol. I like it! Adrien Brody -- who, understandably, was flustered and ill-prepared to accept an Oscar -- rambled a bit, but was classy enough to give out a modest, positive plea for peace as well as a shout-out to a childhood friend serving in Kuwait. No boos, no rolling of the eyes. If you want to shout above your audience, go on "Hardball." Thanks.   Now that the Oscars are over, some of the movies on my "must see" list are "Frida," "Talk to Her," "The Hours" (which I've been resisting for some time now) and "Spirited Away" (which I've heard nothing but good things about and am glad it won the animated feature Oscar instead of the assembly-line Disney films).   In other weekend movie news, I watched my new "Three Colors Trilogy" box set on Saturday night while dogsitting for my sister who was away for the night. I first saw the individual films several years ago when they were first released on VHS. The DVD transfers are amazing, and the extra features are pretty sweet as well. All for $35.99. Nice.  I also rented a strange yet haunting film called "A Taste of Cherry." It's an Iranian film about a guy who wants to kill himself and drives around the countryside in his Range Rover looking for someone to bury him. Not exactly the feel-good hit of the year, but the cinematography was amazing and I'm sure there's plenty of symbolism to take in after repeated viewings. And any DVD released by  urlLink The Criterion Collection  can't be half-bad (except "Armageddon").   Three days before I get on the big plane to Phoenix. I'm not as scared shitless about flying as I was a few weeks ago.

       helen rocks, natalie rocks, and the war sucks   British acting goddess Helen Mirren has  urlLink agreed  to revive her character of Police Inspector Jane Tennison for another installment of the critically acclaimed miniseries Prime Suspect. As a fan, I myself am very much looking forward to this. Unfortunately, the rest of the country will be too wrapped up in the latest reality show to give a crap. Too bad for them.  Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines made a comment blasting President Bush at a recent London concert (which she later apologized for). Im not surprised that it pissed off the notoriously close-minded conservative country music community, but the last straw was when various Republican hick politicians  urlLink suggested  that the band perform a free concert for servicemembers as a way of further apologizing. Let me get this straight: Maines spoke out against the president, which is a perfectly legal form of freedom of expression, and now shes being forced to participate in a free concert like she owes some sort of community service? Excuse me while I step out of the 1950s Way-Back Machine and get my ass back to the present. What? Im already in the present? Oh, shit.   For the first time since I started this blog, I went a whole day without posting (yesterday). I noticed that a lot of my fellow bloggers failed to post yesterday and I wonder how much of it has to do with the war. Personally, I didnt feel a need to not post. I just didnt get around to it. Actually, I was about to post something yesterday afternoon when I looked out my office window and happened to notice approximately 5 or 6 helicopters circling over downtown Boston. My first wartime paranoia instinct was to mildly freak out about it. Then when I made my way downtown en route to Borders, I realized that it was probably due to the massive anti-war rally taking place. I walked by Government Center and witnessed an enormous gathering of people, which was nice to see, but later I talked to Liza and she told me of the walkout protest at  urlLink her school.  Apparently the students were treating it as some sort of excuse to get out of school and party, and on top of that, Liza is probably going to be ostracized by these people for wanting to stay in school in order to get some much-needed studying done. Folks  and this is mainly for the younger ones out there -- if youre going to protest, thats great. But at least treat it with the attention and focus that it deserves and know exactly what youre protesting. I have a feeling that a large portion of the bongo-playing hemp set wouldnt know  urlLink Tariq Aziz  if he sat on them.   Tonight Im going to a party at my friends Nate and Joshs place. Ive been told that their apartment is rather small and  totally non-conducive to parties, so this should be interesting. Saturday Im working in the morning, then Lizas going to accompany me on a mad  urlLink shoe-shopping  expedition (this is an undertaking that requires the company of either a woman or a gay man), then were going to dog-sit my sisters dogs. I like sitting for Barney and Bea  we get to stay overnight at my sisters place, which always feels like Im staying at a nice homey hotel. Then Sunday night is Oscar night! This year I feel I just might win the jackpot. Keep your fingers crossed.

       doing my part to boost the economy   Between my Oscar picks, my attempts at political commentary and my random observations concerning the new Joe Jackson CD, Ive failed to mention that Ive made some pretty nice CD/DVD purchases over the last few days.   Even though I work at  urlLink Borders  and am able to take advantage of their generous employee discount program, I like to stop into  urlLink Newbury Comics  every once in a while, since they have a nice selection of used and import discs (Borders has no used discs, and our selection of imports is laughable). So Friday after work I wandered into our competition and began searching for something cheap I might want to buy. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a copy of  urlLink Mike Keneally's  excellent Wooden Smoke. I already own it (the two-disc special edition, that is), but its always nice to experience that rare treat of seeing Mikes music in stores.  After much indecision, I ended up getting the Afghan Whigs  urlLink "Black Love."  It wasnt used and its not an import, but Im never able to find that title in Borders. Plus, it was only $11.99. I remember reading a lengthy magazine article about the Whigs in March 1996, the day I moved to Italy (I in fact read it on a bus from Rome to Naples, if you must know). A few days later, I bought their acclaimed 1993 release "Gentlemen," which took a long time to click with me, but when it did, it really did (their mostly-covers EP  urlLink "Uptown Avondale"  is nice, too). I once described them as grunge and debauchery meet in a sleazy nightclub, but after hearing Black Love, I think a better description would be Nine Inch Nails as a bar band. Lead singer and songwriter Greg Dullis Tortured Sexual Persona bit gets a little tiresome once in a while, but its fun in a way that cheesy horror movies are fun. And the music is great  evil, dark and funky all at the same time. I havent owned Black Love long enough to be able to compare it to Gentlemen, but so far, initial impressions are strong.   Saturday afternoon (on my way to meeting Liza and Ilsa at the Museum of Science), I got my Newbury Fix once again and grabbed a used copy of Nick Drakes  urlLink "Five Leaves Left"  for $6.99. Another Wooden Smoke reference  I was listening to this amazing disc last week and was thinking that a lot of it reminded me of what I imagined Nick Drake would sound like. I never really heard his stuff before, but I was told he was sort of a brooding British folkie. He made three albums before dying in from a drug overdose in 1974 at age 26. I havent heard Five Leaves Left in its entirety just yet, but what Ive heard so far is really beautiful.   Yesterday, Francois Truffauts  urlLink "Day For Night"  was finally released on DVD (for $14.99!) so I grabbed it but havent had the chance to watch it yet. There are tons of great extra features on the DVD. Ive only seen two Truffaut films so far (The 400 Blows, which I own, and Love on the Run) and I think he was a really amazing filmmaker. Very humane and emotional without being sappy. Next month, his four Antoine Doinel films will be released by Criterion in a  urlLink wonderful box set.  I think I might just have to drop some money on that. I planned on getting the  urlLink Three Colors Trilogy  this week as well, but we sold out at an alarming rate and havent gotten any more in yet (I think my current obsession with French films is my way of combating the whole France-bashing thing).   Today is my brother Garys birthday. Wish him a happy one.

       my 75th annual guilty pleasure   I hate awards shows. I really do. Theyre all multiple-hour self-congratulatory ass-kissing self-important wastes of time. The Grammys (and even more so, the American Music Awards) are for people with no taste in music and no comprehension of anything that isnt played on the radio. The various MTV awards are for people who possess no discernible brain cells. The Emmys? The only prime-time shows I watch (besides Boomtown) are Law & Order and its spin-offs, and they get shut out every year by whatever hip show of the moment is in the spotlight. The Tonys? Sorry, Im a straight male. Im forbidden by law to watch those. And dont get me started on those inane Blockbuster Awards. I wont even rent movies from those anti-widescreen morons. Im sure as hell not going to watch an awards show that recognizes their idea of talent.   Wow, Im angry today. Must be all that pre-war rage.   Having said all that, I will admit to one thing. You must keep this to yourself (and everyone else who surfs the Internet): I watch the Oscars. Thats right. Never miss em. Im an Oscar freak. Yes, its pompous. Yes, the red carpet gauntlet is a pathetic excuse for Joan Rivers to show off her latest plastic surgery freak show. Yes, its very political and a lot of films and filmmakers get the shaft in favor of less-deserving ones. But two things: first of all, I love movies. I absolutely adore them. Second, the Oscars are really the closest thing we, as a civilization, have as far as matching film quality to recognition. I suppose arguments can be made that the Cannes Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, Sundance, etc, are more accurate in terms of proper recognition, but those arent given enough coverage to really allow for good, accurate analysis.   So today Im going to give you my Oscar picks. A few points to make first:  First of all, I have not seen every film nominated. I am going to go by what I know of the films and filmmakers, in addition to how the politics of Hollywood and the Academy work, as well as predictions made by some critics whose work I admire.   Second of all, I am going to give my predictions in only nine areas (actor and actress, supporting actor and actress, director, picture, adapted and original screenplay and song). These are the categories we vote on in our office pool (wish me luck!) and besides, I could care less who wins for Best Sound.  Finally, I will be listing my predictions on who I think will win, in addition to telling you who I think should win. Theres often a big difference.   Are you ready? Lets get this over with, Ive been putting it off long enough  Best Picture: Chicago Gangs of New York The Hours Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers The Pianist  Is there really any doubt in anyones mind that Chicago will win? Not since Titanic has there been such a sure thing. I personally enjoyed the film, but thats beside the point. It was nominated for umpteen and a half awards, theres a huge buzz behind it, and it did well at the Golden Globes, which is usually a pretty strong indicator. As far as personal tastes go, I personally feel that The Pianist should win. Chicago was a fun movie but I can only take so much of musicals; Gangs was very good but not great; I didnt see The Hours and Lord of the Rings was basically a really sophisticated action film. The Pianist was a gorgeous, heartbreaking work of art, Adrien Brody was superb and Roman Polanski proved once again that hes one of the finest directors alive today.   What should win: The Pianist What will win: Chicago    Best Director: Pedro Almodovar: Talk to Her Stephen Daldry, The Hours Rob Marshall, Chicago Roman Polanski, The Pianist Martin Scorcese, Gangs of New York  Pedro Almodovar is an accomplished director, but not a lot of people saw Talk to Her, and besides, whenever a director is not nominated in a Best Picture category, thats a bad sign. Daldry would normally have a decent shot if it werent for Marshall and Scorcese. Same goes for Polanski, plus he has that whole statutory rape thing hanging over his head. Marshall is a definite contender, but I think that theyre going to give Scorcese one of those infamous career achievement Oscars. In other words, the man responsible for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas was shamefully never given an Oscar, so the Academy will attempt to make it up to him by giving him an Oscar for a film that is decent, but nowhere near what hes capable of.  Who should win: Roman Polanski  Who will win: Martin Scorcese    Actor in a Leading Role: Adrien Brody: The Pianist Nicolas Cage: Adaptation Michael Caine: The Quiet American Daniel-Day Lewis: Gangs of New York Jack Nicholson: About Schmidt  Brody is the textbook definition of underdog here. Hes the only non-Oscar winner here and the only one who hasnt even been nominated before. Unless theres a Pianist sweep (highly unlikely), well have to write him off right away. Cage was excellent in Adaptation but the film might be a bit too quirky for the Academys notoriously conservative tastes. Caine was excellent in The Quiet American (from what I hear  I still havent seen it yet), but hes already got two Oscars, the most recent one just a couple of years ago. Nicholson  Christ, is anyone else sick of seeing this guy at the Oscars? In the seventies he was great in a series of brilliant films (Five Easy Pieces, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, The Last Detail). Now I just get the feeling that, for the most part, hes coasting, cultivating that image of the aging Ray-Ban-wearing hipster. Granted, hes a great actor. About Schmidt was terrific. He was terrific in it. But the guys already got three damn Oscars! And the Academy fucked up when they gave him one for the schmaltzy As Good as it Gets. Which leads us to Daniel Day-Lewis. Not only is there lots of buzz about his performance, its quite possibly the finest performance Ive seen all year. He was easily the best thing about that movie.   Who should win: Daniel Day-Lewis Who will win: Daniel Day-Lewis    Actress in a Leading Role: Salma Hayek, Frida Nicole Kidman, The Hours Diane Lane, Unfaithful Julianne Moore, Far From Heaven Renee Zellweger, Chicago  I havent seen Frida, by all accounts it was great, but Hayek is a first-time nominee and thats a big minus. Diane Lane was great in Unfaithful, but isnt getting the buzz that movies like Chicago and The Hours are getting. I would love to see Julianne Moore get an Oscar for the amazing Far From Heaven, but that movie was unfortunately obscured by flashier competition. Renee Zellweger, in my opinion, was not even close to being the best thing about Chicago, and lets face it  that movie was more about singing and dancing than acting. Which leaves us with Nicole Kidman. The Hours was a big hit with the critics and if anyone gets the Oscar for that film, its her. Its probably also a bit of a make-up Oscar after she didnt win for Moulin Rouge.  Who should win: Julianne Moore Who will win: Nicole Kidman    Actor in a Supporting Role: Chris Cooper, Adaptation Ed Harris, The Hours Paul Newman, The Road to Perdition John C. Reilly, The Hours Christopher Walken, Catch Me if You Can  Harris and Reilly will probably cancel each other out. Besides, Reilly was in so many damn movies last year, the Academy will probably forget what film he was nominated for and give up. Despite his excellent performance in Road to Perdition, (didnt see it, but I heard he was great), Newman was probably nominated because hes Paul Newman. The two serious contenders here are Cooper and Walken. Cooper has the Golden Globe going for him, but everyone is talking about how great it was to see Walken (who normally plays psychos) in a brilliant, touching, low-key role. I personally loved it. But I loved Cooper too. Crap. It could go either way. But Im going with my heart and picking Walken for this.   Who should win: Christopher Walken Who will win: Christopher Walken    Actress in a Supporting Role: Kathy Bates, About Schmidt Julianne Moore, The Hours Queen Latifah, Chicago Meryl Streep, Adaptation Catherine Zeta-Jones, Chicago  Bates and Latifah are the underdogs here. About Schmidt might as well have been called About Jack, since everyone else involved in the film has been unfairly brushed aside. Latifah was great in Chicago, but I think she needs a few more good roles under her belt before taking home the statue. Streep was good but I think her step down from actress to supporting actress will hurt her chances. I didnt see The Hours, but Im guessing that Moore will be shot down by Zeta-Jones. I know that Chicago may not be an actors film, but its got to win at least one actor award, so there you go. Plus, political correctness aside, shes pregnant. Thats gotta help.   Who should win: Julianne Moore Who will win: Catherine Zeta-Jones    Adapted Screenplay: About a Boy Adaptation Chicago The Hours  The Pianist  Id love to see About a Boy win something, but I think I was the only person on earth who saw that film. Too bad. How cool would it be for a screenplay about a screenwriter to win an Oscar? I think the Academy recognizes that. It will win.   Who should win: Adaptation Who will win: Adaptation    Original Screenplay: Far From Heaven Gangs of New York My Big Fat Greek Wedding Talk to Her Y Tu Mama Tambien  Everything about Far From Heaven was terrific, and the screenplay is no exception. But My Big Fat Greek Wedding is the big success story of 2002, and Im sure the Academy wants to give Nia Vardalos something.   What should win: Far From Heaven What will win: My Big Fat Greek Wedding    Best Song Chicago I Move On, John Kander and Fred Ebb 8 Mile Lose Yourself, Eminem Frida Burn it Blue, Elliot Goldenthal and Julie Taymor Gangs of New York The Hands That Built America, U2 The Wild Thornberrys Movie Father and Daughter, Paul Simon  U2 won the Golden Globe. Its a done deal. Nothing here really does anything for me, except for the Frida soundtrack, which Ive heard a few times and really like.  Who should win: Frida Who will win: Gangs of New York   I got at least ten bucks riding on this people, so cross your fingers and hope for the best.

       take it away, dad    Yesterday's screed against France-bashing prompted my father and I to engage in some rather interesting e-mail exchanges. As one of pressure drop's (few) devoted readers, he gave me his own two cents about the coming conflict with Iraq, so I thought I would give Al Ingalls (aka Dad) of Orlando, Florida, a spot as "guest commentator." After this, I promise, I'll lay off the political rantings. I'm hardly qualified to be a political blogger. Here is a big chunk of what he sent me in his e-mail yesterday:   "We have managed to elect to the highest political position in the entire world....a person who is totally devoid of intellectual reasoning and/or sophisticated communication skills. His principle support (I believe) comes from folks who stand to profit from his brazen, ill-disguised and ill-advised international and financial objectives.   My life experiences tend to indicate that the hardest position to define is that which is taken against an undefendable, hard-line position. Please note that currently there is very little communication taking place in our government which approaches 'reasonable inter-position discussion and debate.'   Media 'personalities' are taking great liberties with the cavalier labelling of our citizens as 'liberals' or 'conservatives.' The labellers have also taken similar liberties with their definitions of these groups. I don't know which I fall into, because they haven't provided me with the groundrules, however, I do know that in spite of my personal patriotism, my four years of military service during the Korean War, my technical contributions to our defense industry for a period of nearly 50 years and my dutiful and uncomplaining payment of taxes since I was 13 years old....I am treated and labeled by some as a (negative) 'liberal!'  Mr. Bush's speeches, regardless of length or content, usually consist of a single, simple message which (agree with it or not) could be stated in 30 seconds or less.   Today I listened while Mr. Bush's Secretary of State elequently presented his loyal support for his President. Sadly enough, I believe that if Colin Powell were our President, we would not be anywhere near our current political, international position. (Mr. Bush made it a point during the 'Azores Summit' to relate the current situation to a Texas poker game.......Give me a break!)  I'm rambling! I do feel disenfranchised and (sadly enough) alone!  I can only hope and pray that somewhere in this great country we can manage to find an intelligent, moral, inspirational and forceful leader who can bring us together and above all of this idiocy."

       ugly americans, indeed   Can we please stop the France bashing? Please? It really makes us look like idiots.  Im not going to try and get into a political debate here, since there are plenty of people who are better suited for that type of discourse (like  urlLink this guy ). But come on. Lets see if Ive got this straight: France is pressing the United Nations to give weapons inspectors in Iraq more time, saying that war is premature. So all of a sudden theyre a scum-sucking bottom feeder of a people? First of all, lets say that we  should  go to war (I personally believe we  shouldnt,  butjust play along). If we should, and France doesnt agree with us, do you know what that makes them? Ignorant scum? Misguided fools? Boorish Jerry Lewis fanatics? No. That makes them a country that disagrees with us on a particularly hot geopolitical topic. Thats all.   Also, just because the French government doesnt want to go to war, that doesnt mean that the general population of France doesnt either. By the same token, our government wants to attack Iraq, but there are huge amounts of Americans who think that war is a bad idea.   But that apparently doesnt click with Joe Six Pack. I was walking by the Fleet Center Saturday afternoon and a guy was selling two different types of t-shirts: one of them said Saddam Sucks  Osama Swallows. Okay, fine. I think that most of us can agree that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden are a couple of raving lunatics who should be stopped. Im not going to wear the t-shirt, but I can appreciate the sentiment. But the guy was also selling a t-shirt that said France Sucks.   This bothers me on a number of levels. I have a rather sentimental attraction towards France. I lived there from ages five to ten and as a result, I was exposed to a vast amount of culture at a very young age. I had a number of American friends from the English-speaking school I attended, but I was also very good friends with the French kids in my neighborhood. It was an amazing time in my life and Ill never forget it. Being raised in France was one of the greatest things my father ever did for us.   France gets a good kick in the ass from lots of other countries, particularly the U.S. An inaccurate image has been cultivated of the French: theyre rude, they hate everyone else and they believe theyre superior to everyone else. Im going to go out on a limb here, but that sounds more like a description of our own people of late. Im willing to bet that the t-shirt salesman I saw on Saturday has never been to France. I bet hes never befriended a French person, dined in a good French restaurant or even rented a film by  urlLink Truffaut  or  urlLink Godard.  Judging by where I saw him, Im sure hes been to a Bruins game. But has he ever attended a soccer match? I doubt it. Americans are stubborn about embracing any activity that isnt inherently American. Instead, any opinion or pastime that differs from our own is idiotic, and we show our true feelings with moronic t-shirts and dipshit Republican representatives whose idea of a constructive use of taxpayer dollars is to rename French fries Freedom Fries. Theres also the story I saw on the news the other day about a French-born woman in Texas whose garage door was vandalized with spray-paint (they wrote some erudite comment like French scum go home, I think). This behavior, in my opinion, is no better than cross-burning.    urlLink Frank Zappa  said it best: A mind is like a parachute  it doesnt work if its not open.

        breaking promises left and right    I can't believe I actually said that I was going to post both an essay on  urlLink Mike Keneally  in addition to my  urlLink Oscar  predictions  this week . What was I thinking?   Obviously, neither of these projects have been completed and it's Friday afternoon. So they will both have to wait until next week. I have a huge portion of the Keneally piece already written, but it's turning out to be a real bear. Be patient, it'll (probably) be worth it.   This weekend should be fun. I'll be joining Liza and her crazy friend Ilsa (who's visiting from Arizona) for a trek to the  urlLink Museum of Science  on Saturday. I also have a boatload of laundry to do, which is always fun. Really. If I convince myself it will be fun, then it will be. I also need to get  urlLink this damn book  finished already. What is it with me and my slow reading?   One final thought and I'll let you go enjoy your weekend...earlier today I saw an ambulance that actually had the words "Professional Ambulance" written on it. Does that mean that there are actually "Amateur Ambulances" out there somewhere? I mean really. If I'm going into cardiac arrest, I don't want some novice or "freelance" EMT weaving through Boston traffic to save my life.

        in praise of anonymous actors   Lynne Thigpen  urlLink died  two days ago at her home in Los Angeles. The world has lost an extremely talented woman.   Whos Lynne Thigpen? I dont blame you for asking. Shes in a category of actors who always seem to garner recognition, once their faces are shown. But the names never seem to stick. Hell, they never seem to even come up. Im talking about the thankless role of the character actor.   Character actors are those people you see a zillion times in supporting roles, either on television shows or theatrical releases. One of the best-known character actors (relatively speaking, of course) was a gentleman by the name of  urlLink J.T. Walsh.  According to the Internet Movie Database, J.T. appeared in 67 films from 1982 to 1998. Youd recognize him if you saw him, believe me. J.T. passed away in February 1998, and unfortunately, neither Oscar nominations nor eight-figure salaries ever came his way. Why? Because hes a character actor, for cryin out loud! (though I thought it was a nice touch for Jack Nicholson to dedicate his 1998 Oscar to the recently deceased actor).   Thigpen is another actor youd recognize if you saw her face. An African-American woman of 54, she appeared in more than 40 films, in addition to countless television roles. My two best recollections of her are in her portrayal of Judge Ida Boucher on a few episodes of  urlLink Law & Order  (if youre a character actor, chances are youve done time on that fine show) and as a pissed off television interviewer who grills Tim Robbins in the excellent, underrated film  urlLink Bob Roberts  (which also features a young,  thin  urlLink  Jack Black ).   Like J.T. Walsh, Lynne Thigpens greatest amount of publicity occurred when she passed away. This is a shame, not just because people should be around to hear their greatest accolades, but because she, like so many other character actors, worked tirelessly and turned in stellar performances that always seemed to get overshadowed by the big-name stars.   Do yourself a favor: check out Thigpens  urlLink IMDB page  and rent a few of those movies. Youd be surprised how much great acting came out of such an anonymous actor.

        elvis is king (of late night tv)   Maybe Im biased since hes one of my all-time favorite singer/songwriters, but I thought that  urlLink Elvis Costello  did a splendid job of guest-hosting the  urlLink Late Show with David Letterman  last night. Dave has apparently had different guest hosts fill in every day this week due to what I understand to be a case of the  urlLink shingles (ewww). Im not sure what prompted him to choose Elvis as one of the guests, but it was brilliant casting. Elvis was funny, charming, and completely engaging. One of the guests was Eddie Izzard, whos one of those people whose name Ive heard a million times but whose work Ive never actually seen (or heard). He seemed like a very funny chap (and a bit risqu, which can be a good late-night character trait if you can pull it off). I have to admit it was rather amusing seeing Eddie and Elvis chatting on Daves set, like two renegade Brits taking over the US airwaves while the boss is away. I liked it.    Quick observation: Its been two days and Im still obsessed with  urlLink the new Joe Jackson CD.    can you hear me now?   So I finally entered the 21st century last night and bought a cell phone. I insisted that Liza and I be joined at the hip during my entire time inside the Verizon Wireless store since my understanding of (and intimidation by) cell phones is not unlike the apes in  urlLink 2001: a Space Odyssey  when they encountered the monolith. Our cheerfully smart-ass salesman was very helpful in his blunt honesty, and I have to admit that I was happy to get a cooler phone than Lizas. Its one of those flip-phone thingies that folds up (well maybe they almost all do nowadays  give me a break, Im new at this). The phone has about 19 different ring tones, but for now Im being proudly uncool and just using the standard ring. You know, the one thats not some dorky song? The one that justrings? Im so  avant-garde . Actually, one of the ring tones is We Wish You a Merry Christmas, and I told Liza that I should use that as my ring tone all year, except for during the Christmas season. Ha! Wouldnt that be a hoot.

       return of the fabulous four   Morning subway commutes are a necessary evil. I dont have a car, so Im a slave to the  urlLink MBTA.  Im grateful that it exists, but sometimes its just a royal pain. I dont like to be shoved that close together with total strangers, some of whom apparently have yet to discover this fascinating new invention known as deodorant. There are two things that can save my commute from being a completely miserable experience  a good book or a good CD in the Walkman. This morning I was blessed with the latter, and I almost didnt want the commute to end.   As I mentioned yesterday, I picked up  urlLink Volume 4,  the brand new  urlLink Joe Jackson  CD. I listened to it a bit last night on my way home and my impressions were very positive. But I waited until this morning (due to the longer commute) to really dig into it.   A little background first: I first heard Joe Jackson in 1979. My initial exposure to his music came in a rather odd manner. I was ten years old and just starting to learn the drums, but I didnt have my own set just yet. Our family was really good friends with the Hilliards, whose dad worked with our dad. They lived in nearby Chelmsford and the oldest kid, Scott (who was probably around 20 at the time) played the drums and whenever we went over to visit, I would go to his room (in the basement of their split-level), put the headphones on, turn on some random rock radio station and play along. That was the first time I ever heard Is She Really Going Out With Him. In fact, to this day, that song still conjures up memories of banging away on Scotts gleaming five-piece drum set (before the adults yelled down the staircase for me to keep that racket down).  A few years later, during my 1985 Year of Discovery (when I first started buying albums by Elvis Costello, the Jam, Squeeze et al), I picked up Joes Look Sharp album and to this day I still consider it one of my all-time favorites. I suppose you could call it punk or new wave, but like Costello it was intelligent punk. Scrappy guitars and snarling vocals were paired with smart songwriting and killer hooks. Look Sharp had all that in spades.   Joe made two more albums with guitarist Gary Sanford, drummer Dave Houghton and bassist Graham Maby (Im the Man and Beat Crazy) before moving off into such eclectic territory as big band, classical, jazz and more.   When it dawned on Joe that 2003 would mark the 25th anniversary of his original four-piece band, he decided to reform the band with a new album and tour. Volume 4 (its the fourth album with this particular band configuration) is the resulting album and it was released yesterday. Life is good. Anything crappy that happens this week can be alleviated by a quick listen to this marvelous disc.   Volume 4 pays tribute to his past (and even apes it) without being condescending or overtly nostalgic. Like Elvis Costellos recent return-to-roots album (When I Was Cruel), Joes latest shows his original new wave blueprint updated with the things hes learned along the way. In other words, he can still be a snot-faced hellraiser but isnt afraid to shake things up with some sophisticated musical interplay or inventive arrangements.   The opener, Take it Like a Man is a brilliant, piano spiked number reminiscent of Look Sharp with a little Body & Soul (Joes 1984 album) thrown in for good measure. Awkward Age shows how great Joe is with catchy hooks. The album has its fair share of ballads -- Chrome, Love at First Light and Blue Flame  and the latter would sound right at home on Joes 1982 Night & Day album. He knows exactly when to update his sound and when to stick to the basics. The only real low points  and this is really just nitpicking  are the rather forced Little Bit Stupid and Thugs Are Us (which has a nice ska beat, but lets face it: do we really need another song about suburban white kids who try to be black?).  Joe and his band may have lines on their faces, but as far as musical ability goes, they havent aged a bit. I know that Maby has worked extensively as a session musician over the years (most notably with  urlLink They Might Be Giants ), but I havent heard a peep from the other two. Apparently their instruments havent been gathering dust for the past 20 years, because they sound as good as ever. The four musicians were recorded live in the studio in a very simple style that seems refreshing in this era of Pro Tools and mixing board touch-ups.   I dont know if its just a limited edition, but my version of Volume 4 comes with a bonus disc of six songs the band performed last fall at two small clubs in England. They tear through a half dozen nuggets from the early days. If youre planning to see Joe live on his current  urlLink tour,  this makes for a great preview of whats to come. Ill be there myself (at the Paradise in Boston on April 5). Ill be the one trying to get my vinyl copy of Look Sharp signed by the man himself. Wish me luck.

       the downslide of dennis   Anyone who was a fan of comedian Dennis Miller in the late eighties and early nineties was probably horrified (as I was) to see him on the Tonight Show recently. At one time, his sociopolitical, pop-culture-reference-filled rants were funny, incisive and right on the money. But his appearance on Jays nightly Hour of Banality was frightening, to say the least. I was flipping channels ( urlLink my nightly Law & Order rerun fix  was in a commercial break) and stopped when I saw Dennis. What I experienced was a good three minutes of pure unfiltered hatred. I could take it no longer and returned to the much more pleasant sight of  urlLink Jack McCoy  giving the defendant what for on TNT.   Barry Crimmins wrote  urlLink a great article  in the Boston Phoenix. Ill let him take over from here.    volume 4   Joe Jacksons new album,  urlLink Volume 4,  is out today. Will I be picking it up as soon as I get to Borders this afternoon? Hell yes. Expect a review this week. Expect me to blather about it non-stop. Expect the unexpected.

       not exactly an endorsement   After debating over it  ad infinitum  with Liza on Friday afternoon, I finally decided that I would really have to attend the Friday night festivities at  urlLink Dick's Last Resort,  since it was, after all, a birthday party for me and Steph (whose birthday is sometime this week  maybe today). I was dreading going to this place, although Id never actually been before. I heard it was Frat Boy Central. I dont like frat boys. I dont like what they stand for or what they do in their spare time. Ive been accused on more than one occasion of being a snob, and if being a snob means disliking frat boys, well then Im  urlLink John friggin' Gielgud,  okay? So anyway, Liza and I walk in the door and instantly regret doing so. Now let me say right now that I dont mind dives. They have a kitschy sort of charm that lends itself to drinking alcohol. But this place was as if a frat boy was told to design a dive. A big huge basement filled with drunk people, basically. The thing is, I could have skipped it and I doubt anyone would have noticed. Half my co-workers were pretty much obliterated by the time I got there. Liza and I had a couple of beers and  believe it or not - moderately enjoyed ourselves (by engaging in catty people-watching, mainly), then left after a little over an hour. Obligation fulfilled.  Two more things on this subject: remember how I said I would bail as soon as they played anything by the Dave Matthews Band? Well, the house band did in fact tear into a DMB song, but I wasnt about to abandon my half-consumed Heinken at that point, so I guess I broke my promise to you, dear reader. My apologies. But the song was Ants Marching, which, I hate to admit, is one DMB song I actually kind of like.  Also, can we please make it illegal for people to yell alcohol abuse! when someone spills a beer? Please? That was funny when I was, like, 19. Its not funny anymore. Please move on. Thanks.     birthday festivities   So Saturday, after my morning shift at Borders, Liza gave me my birthday gift, which was the newly released  urlLink Jam DVD.  I was expecting it, since I hinted in rather unsubtle terms for weeks that I wanted that for my birthday. Then she took me to lunch at the  urlLink Cheesecake Factory.  I had never been there before, and I enjoyed it quite a bit, but if youve never been, heed my advice: go there very hungry. Portions are incredibly large. Liza and I stupidly ordered a huge appetizer, so by the time my blackened chicken arrived I was practically full. We both ended up taking home doggie bags that could feed a small country. Not only was I extremely full, but I was being taken to dinner that night by my sister Julie. She took me to  urlLink Tullio's,  a great little Italian restaurant in Quincy. The food was excellent -- not that I was able to eat too much of it. I half finished my pork chop Milanese before asking the waitress to add to my doggie bag collection. Still, its a wonderful restaurant that I recommend wholeheartedly. Julie and I drank some wine, we talked a bit about this here blog, I raved about the recent  urlLink Paul Weller  concert, she raved about the new car she just bought, and she also told me how much she enjoys the  urlLink Harmonia Mundi  sampler I lent her, in addition to  urlLink Missa Mexicana,  the latest disc by the Harp Consort. It was a great time and when I met Liza later that night as she was leaving her  urlLink part-time job,  I handed over the latest doggie bag, which she ate when we got home. Happy birthday to me. 34 is turning out nice so far. Im being wined and dined like an Oscar nominee.   By the way, Ive always known that I share a birthday with Lynn Redgrave, Gary Numan, James Van Der Beek and Freddie Prinze, Jr. But last week I found out that I was born on the exact same day (3/8/69) as a porn star named Devon Michaels. I honestly dont know how I feel about that.    discs to burn and rent     Liza twisted her ankle on Saturday, so on Sunday she regrettably skipped dance rehearsal and we spent the day in her apartment, where I finally got my CD burner to work again and I made a disc for her called Pass Me the Laser Beam. You can find the songlist on  urlLink my Art of the Mix page.  Then we watched some of my Jam DVD. Its a great collection, TV footage mixed with some music videos. The videos were a lot of fun to watch. I distinctly remember seeing the videos for Town Called Malice and Absolute Beginners on MTV back in the early 80s (back when they showed videos). Liza and I were cracking up at what passed for conceptual videos back in the day.   Later that night we went to  urlLink Cinemasmith  to rent a DVD. By the way, if you live in the Boston/Brookline/Brighton/Allston area and consider yourself a serious film fan, you owe it to yourself to eighty-six that Blockbuster membership card and get over to Cinemasmith. It's in the very funky Coolidge Corner and has an excellent, eclectic selection of DVDs (and VHS tapes for you old-timers), a huge selection of Criterion discs, and a knowledgeable, mature, voting-age staff (how refreshing). Anyway, we rented  urlLink Unfaithful,  which I didnt think would be my cup of tea when I first saw ads for it last year. But the critics seemed to like it, and criminy, Diane Lane got an Oscar nomination. The movie was very good. Lane was excellent. The scene where shes on the train after her first roll in the hay with her lover was amazing  she didnt say a word in the entire scene but her body language and facial expressions while recollecting her afternoon of infidelity were enough to earn that nomination, I think. Richard Gere was also very good. Im kind of on the fence about that guy. Sometimes hes in pretty-boy mode, but when hes given a good, meaty role, he usually pulls it off quite well. I really think that the scene where he confronts his wifes lover (and the ensuing aftermath  I dont want to give away the plot) is among the best work hes ever done. Later we watched  urlLink Law & Order: Criminal Intent  (not a bad episode, but guest star Joel Grey was a bit too hammy) and  urlLink Boomtown  (excellent as alwaysits the only prime-time show without the words Law & Order in the title that I actually watch).   Stay tunedthis week I intend to give you the Oscar predictions youve all been waiting for, in addition to an essay on the brilliant-yet-overlooked  urlLink Mike Keneally.  There you go. Its in print, now I have to do it.

       i say its my birthday (tomorrow)   So yeah, tomorrows my birthday. Im going to be 34. Im honestly not thrilled about being in my thirties, but I always feel better when I remember that on my 30th birthday, my sister Julie (whos about eight years older than me) told me that her thirties were a lot better than her twenties. So I suppose I have a few more cool years to look forward to. Last night I got a nice jacket in the mail from my mother. So far, however, the best present I received was a comment from Shelley, one of our work-study students. When she asked how old I would be, I told her to guess and she said 26. Im going to see about the possibility of her getting a raise. A few co-workers took me to lunch  urlLink here.  Actually, my boss Kate is also celebrating a birthday this week (Monday), so she was also feted, as they say. Tonight some co-workers at Borders are taking me and fellow Borders employee Stephanie (whose birthday is next week) out for drinks  urlLink here,  which I think is sort of a frat-boy barpretty much the last place youd find me. I guess I should quit the bitchin and appreciate the effort. But if they start playing Dave Matthews, Im outta there.   Pressure Drop is now five days old. I have no idea if Ill ever post on the weekends (this weekend included), since my computer lives at Lizas house and is so slow that navigating the Internet on it is not unlike Chinese water torture. So you may hear from me over the weekend, but maybe not until Monday. Either way, have a great weekend.     Discipline, THRAK, and Life on Other Planets   I took  urlLink Tom's  advice and decided to dive into the works of a band Ive always somehow ignored:  urlLink King Crimson.  Now I know that the mention of King Crimson conjures up images of bloated 70s prog-rock, replete with belching  urlLink Mellotrons  and Tolkein-inspired lyrics. But first of all, some early prog-rock, a lot of which I was exposed to at an early age, is fun in a guilty-pleasure kind of way. And despite the pretentious, overbearing nature of the music, you have to admit that a lot of those bands consist of some pretty amazing musicians. So yeah, although I love the music of  urlLink Elvis Costello,   urlLink Graham Parker  and the  urlLink Smiths,  Im not averse to throwing on an old  urlLink Yes  CD once in a whileas long as nobody sees me doing it.   Another point I should make is that King Crimson  in their current incarnation, anyway  shouldnt really be considered prog. They have a pretty heavy rock sound, not to mention a healthy dose of  urlLink Talking Heads -style quirkiness (its probably not a coincidence that the bands lead singer is Adrian Belew, a former Heads touring guitarist).  So I asked Tom for guidance in this matter and he recommended Discipline, THRAK and the new one, The Power to Believe. I decided to skip the new one for now and pick up the first two. Ive been listening to them on and off since about 9:30 last night and I really enjoy them. Enough to continue digging through their back catalog. So thanks, Tom. Thanks for giving me another excuse to buy more damn music! Like I dont have enough of these discs clogging up my bedroomSeriously, Im happy that Ive discovered these guys and youll probably read more ramblings about them in the future.   Oh, and last night at Borders I listened to the new  urlLink Supergrass  CD (Life on Other Planets) all the way through and I really like it. I have an earlier disc of theirs called In It For the Money, which, despite lots of critical huzzahs from friends and critics, hasnt really clicked with me yet. The new one, however, clicked immediately. Good stuff.

       quote of the day   Hallelujah!  urlLink Drumzspace  hit the nail squarely on the head with this one...  "Solomon Burke is THE man. I'm not a huge fan of soul music nowadays since most of it is plastic, pre-fab, soul-less garbage created by people who wouldn't know Otis Redding from Otis Criblecoblis. But Solomon's release from last year called "Don't Give Up On Me" beathes life into a seemingly dead genre, and reminds us how much feeling is missed in a lot of the crap being spewed forth nowadays."  He's right, you know.

       "when you're spitting out the kodachrome..."   I received an e-mail this morning from a guy named Scott, who enjoyed reading the list of my favorite Elvis Costello CDs thats on  urlLink my amazon.com page.  He prodded me further, asking me a few more questions related to my opinions on EC. Since I dont have any other ideas for posts at this time, I thought I would post his questions and my responses   Q: Top 20 Costello songs? A: Ouch. Elvis has been making records since 1977, and about 95 percent of them I love wholeheartedly. Thatsa couple hundred songs, maybe? Let me just let out a stream-of-consciousness, totally unprepared, non-scientific list of 20 EC songs that make me really happy: The Imposter, Clubland, White Knuckles, Ill Wear It Proudly, Imagination (is a Powerful Deceiver), Deep Dark Truthful Mirror, How to be Dumb, Girls Talk,  Lipstick Vogue, Man out of Time, Shipbuilding, Party Girl, Battered Old Bird, 45, Miracle Man, Motel Matches, Youll Never be a Man, Big Sister, I Hope Youre Happy Now, Its Time.  Q: Are you pro or con the Costello/Bacharach era? A: Scott is referring to Painted from Memory, a 1998 album that Elvis made with songwriting legend Burt Bacharach. I find that album to be an interesting diversion. Elvis and Burt make a good team, and there are definitely some accomplished songs here: a couple of flat-out masterpieces (The Sweetest Punch, Toledo), and songs that are very good but dont necessarily rank among ECs finest (I Still Have That Other Girl, This House is Empty Now, God Give me Strength). There are, unfortunately, a couple of songs that  in my opinion  are bona fide stinkers: The Long Division and Such Unlikely Lovers are so hopelessly syrupy they make Celine Dion sound like Black Flag. Overall, its definitely a noteworthy entry in the Costello catalog and a respectable piece of work, but Im honestly quite happy that he made a return to good old-fashioned rebellion a few years later with When I Was Cruel.  Q: Have you heard the Almost You tribute album and if so, is it worth checking out? A: Almost You is a recently released EC tribute album. I havent heard it, but we received a promo copy at the Borders where I work part-time, and my name is on it (Basically that means that once the disc has finished its stint in our listening posts, I have dibs on it). The only artist on the disc that Ive even heard of is Fastball (a good-not-great power-pop band, IMHO). I have to say that the song selection is a good sign: a lot of good, obscure EC songs. So the short answer is: no, I havent heard it, but I plan to hear it soon.  Q: What is your opinion of Mitchell Frooms production job on Brutal Youth? To my ears that album didnt quite sound like vintage Attractions, despite a number of good songs.  A: Brutal Youth was ECs Attractions Reunion Album. After making records from 1986 to 1993 with a variety of musicians as opposed to his crack three-piece combo of Bruce Thomas, Pete Thomas and Steve Nieve, Elvis brought the lads together again for this impressive 1994 album. I like Brutal Youth. I think the songs are good and the band plays extremely well. But I honestly think that its not quite as good as classic Attractions works like Get Happy, Trust and Armed Forces. I dont know how much of this has to do with the production. Mitchell Froom is an excellent producer who's helmed works by Los Lobos, Crowded House, Richard Thompson, Suzanne Vega (whom he eventually married) and scads of others. He has a unique style that I think works well with Elvis. But Nick Lowe was the studio mastermind behind much of Elvis early output, and his production was one of the things that made those albums great. So while I like Froom, Ill take Lowe if I had to choose.   Q: How infrequently do you listen to The Juliet Letters? A: Ive never heard it in its entirety. Its one of the few EC albums Ive never owned. I dont have a pathological repulsion towards it, but I heard a few songs from it when it was released, and I saw Elvis performing some of it on the Tonight Show when it came out, and it didnt do much for me. The Juliet Letters, for those of you who dont know, is a song cycle that Elvis made with the Brodsky Quartet in 1993. Basically its Elvis singing with a string quartet. I dont have any objection toward the concept in theory, but I dont think this particular match works well. I may very well buy it eventually, just to be an EC completist. By the way, I also feel that For the Stars, Elvis 2001 collaboration with Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie Von Otter, was another example of nice idea, dont enjoy listening to it. I have a healthy respect for both rock and classical, but its a rare feat for them to work well together. Sorry.   The title of this post, by the way, is a line from the Elvis song "Watch Your Step," another great song that I failed to include in the above Top 20.

       my stupid irrational fear   I have a somewhat intense fear of flying. There. I said it. Its in print, its out there. Actually, its not really some deep, dark secret. Many of my friends know this. The thing is, I wasnt always like this. As a child, I didnt mind flying at all. It wasnt until my adult years that I slowly developed this strange trait.   There are really only two things that bother me during a flight (not counting the crappy movies and the uncomfortable seats): turbulence and take-off. I dont care how slight the bumpiness may be, if the planes hitting what the pilots so casually refer to as a little rough air, Im a Class-A basket case. If the plane is flying smoothly, Im perfectly fine. Take-off freaks me out because the plane has to tilt at all these ungodly angles and for some reason, that disturbs the crap out of me. Descending, on the other hand, doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I kind of enjoy it. Go figure.  People always tell me the same thing: The statistics show that its safer than a car! You're not scared of a car, are you? Well no, Im not. Im not even scared of the subway, and those things break down all the time. Cars break down all the time, too. But heres the thing: when a car is experiencing trouble, you can PULL OVER. If a planes experiencing trouble, ta-da! Youre 30,000 feet above the earth! Theres no breakdown lane or gas station up there, folks. Its a feeling of helplessness and frankly, I dont care for it.   I bring this up because at the end of this month, I will be getting on an airplane for the first time in about 20 months. An old friend of Lizas is getting married in Phoenix and were going to the wedding. And I want to go. I want to be there with Liza. Her family out down there and theyre about the nicest people you could ever meet. Ive been there with her three times in the last three years and I always have fun. As much as I hate flying, Ive always managed to pack up a carry-on with my CDs, my Walkman, a plethora of reading material, and get on that plane. That is, untilyou guessed itSeptember 11.  September 11 was a horrific day for people all over the world and were still feeling the effects. We always will. But for people like me who hate flying, that day made us airplane-phobics even more irrational in our fears. Theres something about a bunch of assholes flying planes into buildings that really makes me think twice about boarding.   I know the statistics. I know that many, many planes take off and land every day and crashes are so rare that they make national news when they occur. Thats whats keeping me optimistic. I feel bad for Liza  I know that shes there for me when my white knuckles are grabbing the armrest, and she wants to be. But I also know that deep down inside, shes asking herself, what is the deal with this freak? Why cant he just chill out?   Dont ask me to try and sleep, by the way. I cant sleep on planes. Thats like saying, theres a good chance that a crazed escaped axe murderer is going to visit your house sometime tonight and hack you to pieces, but try not to think about it. Get some sleep. And dont suggest that I get wasted on the plane, either. Ive seen drunk people on planes and I dont want to be one of them.   I just have to calm down, remember the statistics, and try to avoid watching "Die Hard 2" or "Alive" in the next three weeks.

       another tuesday, another street date   First things first: when I told Tom Johnson --  who has a great website called  urlLink unproductivity  --  that I was starting a blog of my own, he warned me that I would begin by posting several times a day. Its addictive, he explained. So consider this the Addicted Phase. I imagine it will taper off after a while.   Today is Tuesday, and for the those of us in the music/video retail biz, that means its Street Day. For a few vague, obscure reasons, all CDs and DVDs are released on this day of the week. Its when the product hits the street. Get it?  urlLink DVD Journal , my all-time favorite DVD website, even goes so far as to use street as a verb in their release  announcements (i.e., Mexican cinema sensation The Crime of Padre Amaro streets on April 1.) How snooty!  Anyway, a couple of things are streeting today that Im fairly excited about. First is Krzysztof Kieslowskis  urlLink Three Colors Trilogy , finally available on DVD. Kieslowski is a Polish director who died in 1996, but not before making three stunning films dealing with women in French society: Blue, White and Red. The films star Juliette Binoche, Julie Delpy and Irene Jacob, respectively, and have an undeniable power, dealing with loss, jealousy, desperation...you knowall that cheerful stuff. I must admit, Ive seen each film only once (at least five years ago), but I was struck at the time at the mesmerizing power of each of these films. Each film also imaginatively incorporates its respective title color into the cinematography. If youre put off by foreign films (a puzzling character trait that Ill never understand  Ill save that subject for a separate post), you might want to stay away from these, but if youre at all interested in striking, daring filmmaking, check it out. The entire trilogy goes for about $35.99you cant beat that.   By the way, if youre curious about certain films that are not yet available on DVD (and why), DVD Journal has a section entitled  urlLink DVD MIA , which lists the most requested unavailable films and suggests possible reasons for the hold-up (usually its a rights issue, sometimes theyre dealing with a temperamental director, etc).    Im also happy that the entire  urlLink Police  catalog is being reissued. Say what you will about Stings massive ego, not to mention the fact that hes become the king of adult contemporary pap; the first three albums by the Police are terrific. Quasi-punk mixed with reggae, ska, and funk. Nothing wrong with that. The fourth album, Ghost in the Machine, slipped a little. Not that its a bad album  in fact, One World (Not Three) is one of my favorite Police songs. But Stings megalomania began really showing itself here, and by the time of Synchronicity (not a terrible album, but not good enough to drop money on, if you ask me), dissolution was fairly evident. Im not going to harp too much on the fact that these reissues are a blatant example of triple-dipping (this is the third time this catalog has been issued), but Ive never owned Outlandos DAmour on CD and its high time I pick it up. How can you go wrong with an album that contains Next to You, Masoko Tanga and Be My Girl - Sally (Andy Summers infamous ode to a blow-up doll). The reissues, by the way, come in the nifty Digipak-style case. Yay for Digipak!  Im headed to my part-time Borders gig tonight, where new releases will be flying off the shelves. How about doing your part to fight this recession and drop some coin in our fine store? Youll be glad you did. Just do me a favor and dont simply use our store for the restroom, okay? We really hate that. Again, thats another post for another time.   If by some chance youre reading this, please  urlLink drop me a line  and tell me what you think. Thanks.

       It's all about the links today   Let's go nuts with the links, shall we?  I work  urlLink here  full-time.  I work  urlLink here  part-time.   My girlfriend Liza goes to school  urlLink here.   Between the ages of five and ten, I lived in France and went to school  urlLink here.   My family lived there because my father worked for  urlLink these guys.   I'm currently reading  urlLink this.   On my way to work this morning, I listened to  urlLink this.   This information is not intended to promote stalking, but rather to give you some more background that may come in handy while perusing future posts. I hope it helps. It's certainly giving me an opportunity to become more familiar with the art of posting, so it's a win-win situation.   On another note, my stupid watch finally died on me last night. I bought it about a year and a half ago. It was a combination digital/analog watch that I bought for next to nothing at  urlLink Filenes Basement,  and it didn't take long for the analog portion of the watch to die on me. Well, last night, while watching reruns of  urlLink one of my favorite shows,  the digital portion died as well. I'm one of those people who finds replacing watch batteries to be a complete waste of time, especially since the watch was pretty cheap to begin with and isn't worthy of a shiny new battery. So I am currently without a watch. On the surface, it may seem that having no watch is a reason to panic (and indeed, it is frustrating from time to time), but I'm looking at it in a Zen kind of way. You know, like "there is no time" or something like that. Whatever. I'm heading back to Filenes over the weekend. In the meantime, please don't ask me what time it is.

       A case for the Modfather   In the fall of 1985, I was a junior at Palos Verdes High School in California. I guess I didnt really fit in, but I belonged to a small group of friends who shared a deep love for music. One of my best friends was a guy named Goran Radovanovic. I will be forever indebted to Goran for turning me on to the music of Elvis Costello. He also was responsible for getting me to listen to a band called the Jam, who had actually broken up about three years before we met.   The Jam were one of Englands biggest bands during their 1977-1982 recording and touring career. A tight punk rock trio influenced heavily by the mod stylings of bands like the Who and the Small Faces, they also incorporated a heavy mix of American soul into their sound (which would become more pronounced as their career progressed). The band consisted of bass player Bruce Foxton, drummer Rick Buckler, and, leading the band on vocals, guitar, and a majority of the songwriting credits, Paul Weller.   The band amassed a strong following in their native UK, racking up hit after hit, and earning a reputation as a fiery live combo. As Weller steered the band towards a more Motown-influenced sound (as evidenced by songs like Town Called Malice, Absolute Beginners and Precious), the public continued to hang on their every note.   Meanwhile, US audiences more interested in Foghat and Debby Boone wouldnt give the Jam the time of day. Weller broke up the band at the peak of their popularity, expressing a need to move on. Which he did, forming the Style Council with keyboard player Mick Talbot. This band became increasingly political lyrically, while the music reflected Wellers need to expand beyond the requisite three-chord punk sound. Jazz, lounge, salsa and other exotic hybrids gave the Style Council a unique sound that initially caught on with the British public, but after a while, even they couldnt handle Pauls musical Attention Deficit Disorder. The Americans, in the meantime, were blissfully ignorant, as usual (remember, musical geniuses like Whitesnake and the Cutting Crew were busy taking over the nation). The band fell apart after their 1990 album, Modernism  a New Decade, was refused by their record company.    Paul fell off the radar for a while, and eventually released a solo single in 1991 called Into Tomorrow. The song found its way on his full-length solo debut, released the next year. The following year, a critically acclaimed second album, Wild Wood, was released. Pauls been consistently releasing albums ever since. His latest, Illumination, was released in the US earlier this year on the tiny independent label YepRoc (based out of North Carolina.   Paul is still packing them in across the pond, where his solo career is bigger than ever, and hes acquired an unofficial nickname, the Modfather (which I heard he really doesnt care for). Last month he embarked on a US tour in which a third of the dates were cancelled due to poor ticket sales. I was fortunate enough to see him on one of the non-cancelled shows, at the Orpheum Theater in Boston. I was treated to what was quite possibly one of the greatest shows Ive ever seen (and Im sure my fellow rapt audience members would agree). Backed by a solid four-piece band, Paul sang, played guitar, electric and acoustic grand piano, shook up a variety of percussion instruments and gave the crowd a thrilling, two-hour ride through his solo repertoire, in addition to a couple of nuggets from his Style Council and Jam days (even throwing in a gorgeous cover of Marvin Gayes Whats Going On). He didnt coast on his former bands reputations and never has.   So why is Paul ignored over here? Is it because hes too British? Paul himself refuses to agonize over it, but doesnt feel that being British is a stumbling block in the States. Monty Pythons fucking massive in the States, he said in a recent interview, and you cant get more British than that! The overtly Oi! British punk sound of the Jam, not to mention the decidedly political and musically schizophrenic sound of the Style Council, may have been hard pills for yanks to swallow, but Pauls solo career is surprisingly accessible  without being pandering. The sound is hard to describe but very easy to digest  combining a folky Neil Young/Nick Drake sound with a soulful swagger reminiscent of classic American Stax/Volt.  Illumination is easy to find in your local stores. Pauls earlier solo albums are a little harder to find, but the worst case scenario is that you may have to pay a slightly higher price for an import. The same goes for the Jam and Style Council albums, most if not all are still in print. Paul's official site is one of the music links listed on this site. You have no excuse. So do me a favor...put down that damn John Mayer CD and try something new.

       "I just cut the hair..."   Saturday afternoon I revisited  urlLink The Man Who Wasn't There , the most recent film by the Coen Brothers. My girlfriend Liza and I rented it last summer and loved it, and last week I decided that it belonged in my DVD collection. So there. I cant tell you how much I love this movie.   Let me start by saying that I believe Joel and Ethan Coen are two of the most brilliant filmmakers working today. As Billy Bob Thornton says in the DVDs interview segment, they dont suck. Thats quite an understatement. Ill go Billy one better: it seems to me that theyre incapable of making a bad film. Theres only one film of theirs that Im not crazy about, and thats Raising Arizona. Sure, its funny in parts, and has a certain charm to it (my favorite line is when Nicolas Cage goes into a convenience store and asks the old guy behind the counter if they have any balloons with funny shapes, to which the old man responds, nopeunless round is funny). But its rather tedious in parts, and in my opinion, ridiculing white trash  while entertaining to a point -- is overrated. Mullets and wife-beater shirts can only make me laugh for so long.   One of the Coens many strong points is their ability -- not unlike the late, great, Stanley Kubrick -- to experiment with a variety of different genres in a completely effortless manner. Film noir. Mafia drama. Screwball comedy. Period pictures. They make it all seem so easy.  The Man Who Wasnt There is obviously an homage to film noir. Taking place in 1949, the film is shot in sumptuous black and white and stars Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, James Gandolfini, Michael Badalucco, and Tony Shalhoub, among others. Billy Bob Thornton plays Ned Crane, a near-comatose barber in Santa Rosa, California, who suspects his wife (McDormand) is sleeping with her boss (Gandolfini). I dont want to reveal too much of the plot, so lets just say that Thornton engineers a blackmail scheme that goes horribly wrong.   Thornton is pretty much flawless. He plays the quiet, passive Crane with amazing ease. Everyone in the film is great, in fact, but the other standout is Tony Shalhoub, who plays Freddie Riedenschneider, the vain, fast-talking defense attorney. Hes one of those guys who loves to hear himself talk, even though most of it is hot air. He also loves talking about himself in the third person (I know you didnt hire Freddy Riedenschnider to hold your hand during a sentencing trial!). Most people know Shalhoub as the Middle-Eastern cab driver on the TV show Wings, but here (and in a previous Coen Brothers film, Barton Fink), he shows a much different side. Hes truly fantastic in this film.   The music is great too. Carter Burwells score, in addition to the use of Beethoven piano sonatas, provide a haunting backdrop.    The DVD looks great, and the extras are very entertaining as well. Theres some interesting interview soundbites from cast members, a thoroughly entertaining and lengthy interview with the films directory of photography, Roger Deakins, but the best feature by far is the audio commentary. Joel and Ethan are joined by Thornton in what has to be the most entertaining commentary Ive ever heard. Theyre funny, informative and informal. Sometimes these commentaries tend to get stuffy and inscrutable, but this is like having three of the films collaborators hanging out in your living room.  At the risk of sounding like an old fart, why dont they make movies like this anymore? I dont just mean black and white movies, but movies with great performances, plots that arent contrived and formulaic, movies that pay tribute to the past while at the same time blazing new trails. I guess as long as the Coens are alive and well, we can still enjoy stuff like this.

       pressure drop is on the air    My name is Chris. This is my blog. It will probably focus mostly on music. CD reviews, my opinions on particular artists, my thoughts on recent concerts I've attended, blah blah blah. I will occasionally veer off into other areas too. Film-related comments will appear frequently as well, and maybe opinions on books I'm reading.   I originally began a blog last Friday but, due to my complete incompetence in the areas of html, it became a disaster and now it's floating around in cyberspace, abandoned and full of inexcusable errors. Maybe someday I'll clue you all in on the url of that lost site. But not now. I'm still a little sensitive about it.   I spent a good part of the weekend trying to come up with a name for this new site. I also spent a good part of Sunday afternoon revisiting some of my reggae/ska discs and after listening to a compilation of the incomparable Toots and the Maytals, I realized once again that if I had to pick my favorite song in the world (an impossible task that I hope I'll never be forced to undertake), Toots' "Pressure Drop" would be a definite contender. It's not a very long song, it doesn't say anything particularly profound (not that I can tell, anyway), and it's not very complicated -- in fact, it's pretty blatant in its simplicity. But it's got an unmistakable feel to it that makes it impossible to resist. Well, for me, anyway. So it's only fitting that "Pressure Drop" is the name of the place where I ramble.   Don't panic. I don't really know what I'm doing, but that doesn't mean you can't watch the train wreck.   I would like to begin my blog journey by giving eternal thanks to Terry, aka  urlLink nitpicker.  He and I go way back and he gave me sage advice on the subject of weblogs. His site is quite informative and as you can tell by reading it, he's much smarter than me.   Enjoy. Stay tuned. Thanks.

       support local music   If you live in the Boston area, you should really try and catch  urlLink The Secret Channel.  Okay, I'll admit, they're getting some free publicity on my blog because Jim, their drummer, works in my office. But Jim is a really nice guy and although I have yet to see them live, I have a Secret Channel EP that sounds really good. In fact, I feel awful about having not seen them yet. Every time they're in town, I have some lame (but truthful) excuse for skipping the show -- either I'm broke, or I'm working that night, or -- in one case -- I'm catching another band that same night whose lead singer is an  urlLink Emerson  classmate of Liza's. At any rate, The Secret Channel are playing  urlLink T.T. the Bear's  in Cambridge on May 18 with  urlLink Hey Mercedes.  You should go.

       the obligatory madonna rant   Madonna is an easy target in the weblog community, I'm sure, but I feel I have to get this stuff off my chest. Yes, I watched her interview with Matt Lauer last night (I missed the first 15 minutes of it, though). I don't particularly care for Madonna, but  urlLink TNT's Law & Order reruns  have been on hiatus due to a big stinkin' heap of basketball games that apparently take place this time of year that we, as Americans, should apparently be glued to the TV for or else we're cowards and traitors. Or something.   Jesus, that was quite a little mini-rant. Where was I? Oh. Madonna. Right.   Anyhoo...I watched it, trying as hard as I could to eke out a bit of respect for Mrs. Ritchie. But you know what? This woman just doesn't do anything for me. I love how her supporters (and even some of her detractors) claim that she knows how to "play the media." "She's the queen of self-promotion," they all trumpet. Well, sorry if I don't jump on the bandwagon, but she didn't exactly have me eating out of the palm of her hand last night. First of all, Matt broached the subject of Madonna's questionable film career, particularly her disastrous remake of "Swept Away." Each and every statement she made concerning her trainwreck of an acting career was enhanced with petulant whining and childish defensiveness. I was expecting her, at one point, to ask Matt, "I know you are, but what am I?" At one point, Matt started to read reviews of "Swept Away," an action that was met with anger and frustration. "Stop! Don't! I don't want to hear it!" blurted Madonna. She claims she "doesn't read reviews," but when Matt later asked her if she thought she was relevant anymore, Madonna asked: "Are you referring to that New York Times article?" You mean the ones you never read, Madonna?  At one point in the show, Matt sat down with Madonna and her guitar teacher and she showed him a few chords that she's recently learned. She even cranked out a shaky version of that old classic rock warhorse, "Stairway to Heaven." Call me a snob, but shouldn't someone who's been in the music business for the past 20 years have acquired at least the slightest hint of music theory along the way?  Apparently not. What matters to Madonna is her image, her ability to "reinvent herself," and her dance moves. I'll be the first to admit that dancing and choreography require immense talent, concentration, and practice. But why on earth would I buy a CD of someone who dances really well? I sure as hell wouldn't do it for her mediocre singing voice. So why exactly do we worship Madonna? She's in the pop music business, but she can't sing. She's just learning to play music, so she obviously doesn't write her own songs. And we all know that she can't act. Wow! What a talented woman!   Last night's special concluded with a short "unplugged" performance at a Tower Records store. The crowd went absolutely insane, but were they hearing the same mix as I was? They were obviously ga-ga over the fact that a "celebrity" was in the room, because the music sounded like ass. As I've said before, unplugged, back-to-basics performances tend to showcase the songs and the performers. "No frills" means you can concentrate on the music. Unfortunately for Madonna, that's exactly what happened at Tower.

       like a ton of kubricks    I bought Stanley Kubrick's 1956 classic  urlLink "The Killing"  DVD a couple of months ago, and I just got around to watching it last Sunday. Why? I kept forgetting I had it. Anyway, it's a remarkable film and you should check it out. Maybe even purchase it. Most places only sell it for around 10 to 12 dollars. The film, like most of Kubrick's work, is way ahead of his time. It tells the story of a racetrack heist from a series of different perspectives in a non-linear sequence (a friend of mine told me that it was a major inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs").   For those of you who didn't already know, I'm a huge fan of  urlLink Stanley Kubrick.  Like Frank Zappa, Kubrick was an artist who refused to compromise his vision and insisted on complete creative control at all times. Control freak? Maybe. But that attitude help him turn out some of the greatest motion pictures of all time. While he worked slowly (he directed only 13 feature films in about 48 years), but his perfectionism was worth it. He rarely worked in the same genre twice: he made war films, black comedy, period pieces, science fiction, horror, mystery and film noir and made them all seem effortless. Films like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Barry Lyndon" revolutionized filmmaking (the former was a quantum leap in special effects; the latter used natural light like never before, employing camera lenses originally designed for NASA).    For Kubrick fanatics, the  urlLink Stanley Kubrick Collection  DVD box set (re-released in 2001 after the 1999 release was deemed a shambles of horrible transfers) is a feast for the eyes and ears. The set encompasses eight films ("Lolita," "Dr. Strangelove," "2001: a Space Odyssey," "A Clockwork Orange," "Barry Lyndon," "The Shining," "Full Metal Jacket" and "Eyes Wide Shut") in addition to a terrific domcumentary, "Stanley Kubrick: a Life in Pictures," that is almost worth the price of the whole set.     As far as the box set goes, the individual films don't have much in the way of extras. Kubrick was a notoriously private person who shunned interviews and likely couldn't be bothered to record commentary tracks. One exception is "The Shining," which includes a rough-but-entertaining behind-the-scenes documentary shot and produced by Kubrick's daughter, Vivian. The film shows what a lot of people have been curious to see over the years -- Kubrick at work. Also, Vivian recorded a commentary track for it, which has to be one of the funniest, most entertaining tracks I've ever heard. It's full of stories about the production, background information, and catty asides about extras and whatnot. It's an absolute delight.    Most of the rest of Kubrick's  oeuvre  can be found on DVD. While his early short films ("Day of the Fight" and "Flying Padre") and his first full-length feature ("Fear and Desire") have never been released on DVD or even VHS, subsequent films like "Killer's Kiss," the aforementioned "The Killing" and the excellent "Paths of Glory" are all available at quite reasonable prices. "Spartacus" is also available, both in a bare-essentials edition and a double-disc Criterion release. I urge you to get the Criterion one. It's more expensive, but looks a whole lot better and contains umpteen extra features (Kubrick practically disowned "Spartacus," by the way. He was brought on to direct it by its star, Kirk Douglas, after the original director was fired. It was the last time Kubrick was not given complete control over a film).   I have a hard time picking my favorite Kubrick film -- they're all great -- but if I had to, it would probably be a tie between "Dr. Strangelove" and "Barry Lyndon." "Stranglelove" is just so damn funny, and "Lyndon" has the most amazing cinematography I've ever seen, particularly for a period picture. The Zeiss lenses that were used for shooting this film made candelight and other natural light sources come alive. It's been accused of being a slow-moving film (over three hours), but it looks absolutely gorgeous. And the story really  is  interesting. Kubrick films, by all accounts, were a pain in the ass to put together, but the final results were always astounding.     I wouldn't rush out and by the box set without seeing the films first. But if you're a fan of daring, revolutionary filmmaking, this is one director whose work is worth your time. Rent a few of them and see what the fuss is all about.

       fun with spam   E-mail spam used to just irritate me. It still does, but lately it's been baffling me as well. This morning when I checked my e-mail, in addition to the promise of nasty teen slut photos and notices from the Nigerian businessman looking for a safe place to unload his $15 million, I found a message entitled "no physical exam needed." A normal spam-type message header, I know. But in the body of the e-mail was this: "xzdckmsdwfx xwvwpjn inxt b yeaeqexwsmuy lhkvnlsrood fqe gdlmg s eirt dnq no."  These shysters. First they tempt with the promise of no required physical exam, and then they spring this on me. How can I resist?

       pressure drop hits the big time (possibly)   This isn't a 100 percent sure thing, but at this time arrangements are being made to have a semi-celebrity interviewed by yours truly, to be posted exclusively on pressure drop (probably in about a month). I'm not going to say who it is because it would be unfair to you (and him) to promote this "celebrity" in question only to have things quite possibly fall apart later. Suffice it to say that he's appeared on Conan O'Brien  and  David Letterman, has been interviewed for many publications (including a fairly length piece for Rolling Stone a while back), and once opened for Bruce Springsteen. He's also an extremely talented and charming fellow and his debut full-length studio album is one of my top ten favorite albums of all time. Yes, this is a cheap promotional ploy to get you to keep checking out this site, but I swear by all that is holy that I am not making this up. Stay tuned.

       the middlebrow reader    I decided not to finish reading  urlLink "The Emperor of Ocean Park,"  not because it was a bad book -- in fact, it was quite good -- but because I wasn't really in the mood for it. I will definitely get back to it eventually. Plus, it's a hardcover, and I always put my reading material in my Old Navy "man bag," which tends to get really weighed down when there's a 650-plus page hardcover inside. It may not sound like a big deal, but try hauling that around all day long. So I reverted back to my simpler tastes, a.k.a. espionage novels. I picked up a nice cheap "mass market" copy of  urlLink "The Devil's Alternative"  by Frederick Forsyth and started reading it last night.    I suppose I consider myself a "middlebrow" when it comes to books. You won't necessarily see my nose buried in "the classics," although I will occasionally try them out for variety's sake -- I read a few  urlLink Shakespeare  plays earlier this year and enjoyed them in small doses. Also,  urlLink "Lust for Life"  is one of my all-time favorite books. At the same time, I'm not a fan of romance novels, "Oprah" books, most cookie-cutter mysteries, or those damn "Sex and the City"-inspired urban-woman "Bridget Jones"-type books that seems to pop up every two seconds. I do enjoy a good mystery --  urlLink Michael Connelly  is an amazing writer who is always able to weave a good crime case around interesting characters.  urlLink Jay McInerney  is probably my favorite "urban fiction" writer, if such a category exists. Oh, and while I'm thinking of it, the next time you're in a bookstore, pick up  urlLink "The Ice Harvest"  and  urlLink "The Walkaway"  by Scott Phillips. I read them both last summer and they're simply amazing.    I don't know where my fascination with espionage thrillers started, but I love them. Among my favorite authors of this genre are Jeffrey Archer, Joseph Finder, and the man I consider to be the master of the genre, Frederick Forsyth. Some of my favorite Forsyth books are  urlLink "The Deceiver,"   urlLink "No Comebacks"  (an excellent short story collection) and the classic  urlLink "Day of the Jackal."  The latter was made into an equally excellent  urlLink film.  (but for the love of God, don't see the awful remake with Bruce Willis).     here comes the weekend    A couple of nice things are going on this weekend. Tonight Liza and I are going to use her two monthly comp tickets at the  urlLink Improv Asylum  (where she works part-time at the box office). I've been to the show there at least a dozen times, but this one is going to be special because one of the best-known actors there (and most talented, in my opinion) is performing his last show. We'll laugh! We'll cry!   Sunday afternoon my sister Julie and I will be upping the ante on our snooty behavior once again with a visit to the  urlLink Dedham Choral Society's  performance of a  urlLink piece  by Monteverdi. An apparently, during all of these fun-filled events, I'll be dealing with some really shitty weather. So what else is new?    Have a great weekend!

       time to close the doors   I don't have time to elaborate on this topic since I'm headed out the door in about 30 seconds, but I just need to get this off my chest. Ray Manzarek needs to realize that the Doors -- never really a great band to begin with, if you want my opinion -- came to an end more than three decades ago. Give it up, Ray. Enough with the nostalgia tripping. Enough with the revolving door of "guest vocalists." Enough with idolizing your former lead singer, who -- again, in my opinion -- was not really much of a "poet" and more of an alcoholic, drug-addled buffoon. Put an end to these embarrassing reunion tours, do something about that idiotic circa 1983 new wave haircut, and put Jim Morrison out of your mind for two minutes. Okay? Okay.

       in praise of palmermix   If you have a weblog, create a link for  urlLink palmermix.  If you don't have a site, just add palmermix to your PC's bookmarks. Really. I discovered his blog a few weeks ago and the guy just keeps getting better and better. Just recently he's posted some spot-on remarks about Pete Townshend's solo career, Nina Simone's recent unfortunate death and Bruce Springsteen's vocal support of the Dixie Chicks. Palmermix.

       bagels and ecomonics   I adore the bagel sandwiches at  urlLink Bruegger's.  Really. Particularly the smoked salmon sandwiches. Theres a Brueggers in the building where I work, and theres even one across the street from the Borders where I work part-time. Theyve got it in for me. They know that Ill spend my hard-earned pay in their fine establishments. Although, I have to say that Ive curbed my Brueggers consumption in a major way over the last few months. I used to go there almost  every day  and have a smoked salmon sandwich, a drink (usually a Nantucket Nectar iced tea), a french vanilla muffin (mmmm.french vanilla muffins), and a coffee. About nine bucks. Almost every day. In the interest of keeping my waistline down to at least 35, and keeping a little more money in my pocket, I now only go there once in a while (two or three times a month is my current average, Id say), and usually bring my lunch with me. Another advantage to resisting the mighty Brueggers urge is that I have considerably more spending money. Which Ive been sinking into my CD collection lately. Not exactly the same as putting it away, but hey  Ill get to that endeavor eventually.      old french perverts and ocean park emperors   Speaking of sinking money into CDsI really am getting into this Serge Gainsbourg fella. As I told you yesterday, I bought the compilation Initials SG over the weekend. Last night I picked up  urlLink "Du Jazz dans le Ravin"  and  urlLink Aux Armes et Caetera.  Du Jazz is pretty self-explanatory, a 1997 compilation of his jazzier stuff, mostly from the late fifties and early sixties. Lots of little jazzy instrumentals in addition to some jazzy crooning. The whole thing is great (and jazzy), and Im particularly taken by the song Intoxicated Man, which features some killer Hammond organ, and a really unusual combination of French and English in the chorusCes araignees sur le plastron / dmon smoking / ces chauves-souris au plaford / du livingroom. The way he says dmon smoking, I just cant describe it, its very cool.   Aux Armes is very different. Its Gainsbourgs reggae album. Really. Its hardcore reggae, recorded in Jamaica with reggae session vets like Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare and the I-Threes (Bob Marleys back-up singers). He may be French, but when Serge wants to do reggae, he apparently doesnt do it half-assed. This stuff is the real deal. Of course, instead of some dreadlocked Jamaican toaster, youve got Serges monotone French voice gliding over the whole thing. Which is nice. The lyrics of the title track, by the way, are apparently La Marseillaise, which is the French national anthem. In front of a reggae song. Sung by a middle-aged party animal chain-smoker. Not exactly Britney Spears.   As I mentioned yesterday, I put Michael Connellys Lost Light on hold for the time being and decided to start reading  urlLink "The Emperor of Ocean Park,"  a novel by Stephen Carter, an African-American Yale professor who received a $4.2 million advance for this, his first work of fiction. Despite all the idiosyncratic backstory, the book is turning out pretty interesting so far, an engaging story and a unique, dense, very descriptive narrative style.

       thats quite an eclectic selection youve got there    I suppose the above line is what the average person might say to me when they found out about the pile of compact discage I acquired over the weekend, in between enjoying the weather, logging in the requisite four hours at the  urlLink Borders  gig on Saturday morning and spending some time with my extended family. Nice weekend, overall. Heres how it happened:  After I punched out of Borders around noon-ish on Saturday, I added two more  urlLink King Crimson   CDs to my ever-growing collection: Beat and Three of a Perfect Pair, both from KCs excellent Belew/Fripp/Bruford/Levin period. I havent had a chance to fully digest these discs yet, but so far Im enjoying what I hear. Theyve both acquired a shaky reputation in some circles as being dumbed-down, commercial pop versions of the excellent Discipline (the 1981 debut release of this particular line-up), but they sound fine to me. In the world of King Crimson, commercial is a relative term. Also, there was a huge listening station change-out on Friday night, so there were plenty of promo discs available for pick-up. I nabbed both a Mozart piano trios disc and a Boccherini guitar quintet disc from the excellent  urlLink Classical Express  budget label, in addition to Diana Kralls  urlLink "Live in Paris"  album (I dont own any other DK or am even that familiar with her, but I figured a live album would be a nice place to start). I also got the new  urlLink reissue  of Yes Fragile album. Yay! Rhino's recent reissue includes extended liner notes and two bonus tracks (a rough early version of Roundabout and their impressive, totally Yes-ified cover of Paul Simons America, which I havent heard in eons since I lived with my brother and heard his version from the Yesterdays compilation). To top it off, the jewel case is enclosed in one of those nifty slipcase things. Im all about cool packaging.   After work, I met Liza for lunch at Annas Taqueria. Do you live in Boston? Do you like Mexican food? Well, for crying out loud, get your ass over to Annas. Theres four locations and theyre all great. We were at the one on the corner of Summit Avenue and Beacon Street, which has become so popular that theyve added a second serving line. After a trip to the  urlLink Body Shop  where Liza used the rest of the $50 gift certificate I got her for Valentines Day, we met my sister Julie at her house and then all headed up to lovely Windham, New Hampshire, where my Aunt Elaine hosted a wonderful little get together for my Mom, who was in town from Maryland over the weekend. Mom and Charlie (her companion of the last thirteen years or so, and an all around excellent dude) came up to New Hampshire to pass papers on the condo shes owned since 1983 and had finally decided to rid herself of. So Saturday night was a night of heavy Boston accents, Italian food, and three, count em, three birthday cakes for my Aunt Linda, whose birthday was the next day.   Liza and I blew off an originally planned brunch at the  urlLink House of Blues  in favor of sleeping in, and finally made it out of my house by around 4 p.m. We ended up wandering around Harvard Square, an activity I absolutely love, where the  urlLink HMV  store was selling everything for 30% off. Thats roughly the same discount I get at Borders, so it was like visiting a completely different Borders location. Yay! Their classical selection is probably the best in the city (Virgin Megastore comes close, and ours isnt too bad), but I ended up getting a Serge Gainsbourg compilation entitled  urlLink "Initials SG"  and the soundtrack to  urlLink "Barry Lyndon,"  which Ive been searching for interminably and is apparently only available as an import.    Ive been contemplating getting some Gainsbourg CDs for the longest time. His popularity among people like Beck and John Wesley Harding has always intrigued me. The music is sort of hard to explain. Hes a sort of French dirty old man whose music straddles the borders of jazz, funk, cabaret, reggae and a whole bunch of other stuff. His voice, by the way, sounds completely different that what I expected. Its a smooth, rather accessible voice, and I was expecting a raspy, Tom Waits/Paolo Conte sound (considering the fact that he was a Gitanes-smoking fiend).   After the productive trip to HMV, we went to  urlLink Chili's  for dinner and headed back to Brighton in a rather unconventional manner, taking the train to Central Square and then walking to Allston by going down Brookline Street through Cambridgeport. One of my favorite Boston walks is the length of Brookline Street from Mass Ave to the BU bridge. The houses have a funky edge to them, but are located in a gorgeous, woody, residential area.   If anyone out there can recommend some other worthwhile Serge Gainsbourg discs, please let me know. Oh, and Ive abandoned  urlLink Michael Connelly's  Lost Light for the time being. I love Connellys books, but this particular book just doesnt seem to be grabbing me. Maybe Im just not in the mood. I started, for the umpteenth time, John LeCarre's  urlLink "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"  this morning. We'll see how that turns out. Given my weakness for espionage novels, I don't know why I haven't read this book yet, since it's supposedly the Rosetta Stone of the genre. I have a feeling that once I get going with it, I'll be glad I did. In regards to espionage novels, I've had the urge to read  urlLink "The Devil's Alternative"  by Frederick Forsyth for about a year now. It's weird: the first time I ever set foot in what was to become my apartment in Dorchester was when Frank was hosting a going-away party for a fellow Borders employee. I was somewhat sure that I would be moving in there a couple of weeks later, and it was a wonderful rainy Saturday afternoon. I was looking out the living room window, onto a view of Dorchester, and I caught a glimpse of a tanker moving across the Boston Harbor. I suddenly began thinking of this novel, in which a Soviet  tanker plays a pivotal role (I think -- I listened to an abridge audiobook version several years ago). Suddenly I felt like it was the perfect time to read this book and it never really went away. I'm funny like that.

       twenty of many   I really don't have anything to post today, but I feel like I should. It's not that I haven't been in the mood, I've just been so damn busy at work today. But a "good" busy. I haven't really prepared anything to write, so here's the ultimate cop-out: a random desert island disc list. This is an ever-changing, constantly growing list, but here's twenty albums, in no particular order, that I could listen to over and over:  Bob Dylan: Blood on the Tracks Joe Jackson: Look Sharp! Frank Zappa: The Yellow Shark Lyle Lovett: Pontiac They Might Be Giants: Lincoln Paul Weller: Wild Wood Hilliard Ensemble featuring Christoph Poppen: Bach - Morimur Miles Davis: Kind of Blue The Beautiful South: 0898 Mike Keneally: Wooden Smoke John Wesley Harding: Here Comes the Groom Glenn Gould: State of Wonder Billy Bragg: Talking with the Taxman About Poetry Graham Parker: Howlin' Wind Keith Jarrett: Whisper Not Van Morrison: Astral Weeks Elvis Costello: Get Happy!! Warren Zevon: Excitable Boy The Smiths: Meat is Murder The Jam: All Mod Cons  I'm not suggesting that you go out and buy every one of these, but they all make me very happy and might just do the same for you. This is by no means a comprehensive list. There are many, many more. Have a great weekend!

       errata   Yesterday I wrote that Todd Rundgren plays all the instruments on his brilliant "Something/Anything?" album, with the exception of a couple of live tracks. That's inaccurate. The entire second half of disc two (or "side four" in vinyl terms) constitutes a full band. Just thought I'd clear that up and avoid accusations that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about (which I occasionally don't, I'll admit).

       ive suffered for something/anything   Have I mentioned how much Im loving this amazing weather? I am. A lot. As I remarked in a recent post, Im a winter person. I love rain, snow and cold. But this winter  the most brutal New England winter I think Ive ever experienced -- has really tested my patience and Im welcoming the warmth.   This morning, on my way to the subway, I was not only enjoying the rays of the elusive sun, but also the sounds of my CD Walkman. Specifically a great live unplugged CD by Marshall Crenshaw called  urlLink "I've Suffered for my Art...Now It's Your Turn."  I acquired my promo copy of this disc in 2001, shortly after it was released, and it got some pretty heavy rotation in the portable CD player for quite a while. Now its back on the personal playlist. I really enjoy these live unplugged affairs. A singer/songwriter playing his songs on an acoustic guitar in front of a small, appreciative crowd really brings out the quality of the compositions. Paul Wellers  urlLink "Days of Speed"  and Warren Zevons  urlLink "Learning to Flinch"  are two other great examples of this format.   Crenshaw is another one of those artists who rarely gets mainstream recognition, but most people love the songs once they hear them. In my opinion, he ranks right up there with Elvis Costello and Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook (Squeezes songwriting team) as one of the best songwriters of the eighties. He had a minor hit in 1982 with a song called Someday, Someway and then promptly fell off the pop culture radar (with the exception of a brief acting role as Buddy Holly in the Richie Valens biopic La Bamba).  Despite the lack of exposure, Marshalls been quietly making enjoyable, often brilliant albums to this day. A few years ago, Rhino released a great Crenshaw compilation entitled This Is Easy, but I would personally recommend Ive Suffered for my Art as the ultimate primer on the brilliant songwriting of Marshall Crenshaw. The songs are front and center here, not to mention Marshalls wonderful voice and guitar playing. The crowd (recorded at the Stone Poney in Asbury Park, New Jersey) is hugely appreciative as well.  Another disc I spent part of my commute enjoying this morning is Todd Rundgrens  urlLink "Something/Anything?"  Ill admit that my knowledge of Todds music is somewhat limited, but about a year ago I began hearing some great things about this particular album on  urlLink alt.music.mike-keneally  (Mike himself is a huge Rundgren fan), so I picked up this double-disc and began immersing myself in some important early seventies rock history.  The album really is amazing, if only for the fact that Todd played all the instruments himself (except for a couple of live tracks) and wrote all the songs himself (except for a couple of covers). But unlike a lot of one-man-band affairs, this doesnt sound like a silly novelty project. This could easily be a highly skilled group of session musicians, which speaks volumes for Todds expertise and ambition. The songs themselves run the gamut from pop masterpieces (I Saw the Light, "Hello Its Me) to bizarre artifacts of the time period (the quirky instrumental Breathless, the prog-rock Song of the Viking). All for $17.99 (thats what I paid for it, anyway).

       get over yourself, explained (sort of)   Yesterday's post was supposed to be a jab at the ridiculous rock star behavior of Chan Marshall, a.k.a. Cat Power. Then I veered off into a bit of a tangent near the end. I ended up disturbing someone whose opinion means a lot to me. I sent her an e-mail as a clarification. Here it is, more or less:  I'm not invalidating anyone's opinion on any type of art. There is tons of art, music and film that moves me tremendously. I think that when a "rock star" (I'm really limiting these opinions to music, by the way) has the gall to suggest that his or her music is so powerful that it will change the world simply because he or she is expressing a profound statement, then that person needs to get over him or herself and realize that they're only reaching a certain percentage of the world's population, and also that there are people out there who a) may not agree with their statement, and b) may not feel that rock or pop music is a valid avenue for world change.    I think what I was trying to say -- and apparently I didn't say it correctly -- is that pop/rock musicians have placed themselves on such a pedestal that they don't realize their music isn't as universal as they may think.    It's possible that a John Lennon song, a U2 song or a Bob Dylan song will make people think. It can change their perceptions. If an artist has enough fans, he can give people guidance and advice on a world situation because they listen to him. But rock music reaches a relatively small part of the world. We are led to believe otherwise.   I am a realistic person, but also a hopeful one. Music, art and film are very important to me, but there are a lot of people out there who view them simply as entertainment and to think that we're going to change the opinions and actions of Saddam Hussein or any other war-mongering nut, is unrealistic.

       get over yourself   On his TV show Politically Incorrect, the often-misunderstood and occasionally brilliant Bill Maher presented from time to time a segment he called the Prince Rogers Nelson Get Over Yourself Award, given to celebrities he felt took themselves and their status just a little too seriously. Howard Stern, Claudia Schiffer and even Judge Lance Ito were some of the recipients of this dubious honor.   Now that Bills show is off the air, Id like to bring back that award, at least on occasion where I feel a certain celebrity has gotten a little too smug about his or her status as a famous person. What brought this idea on, for me, was an article I read this morning about a singer/songwriter named Chan Marshall, who inexplicably goes by the pseudonym of  urlLink Cat Power.  Ive heard Miss Powers music before, and to be honest, shes not really that bad. Shes developed a rabid following among the hip indie crowd for her depressing, minor-key quasi-folk music, which I can actually appreciate in small doses (think a female, dissonant Nick Drake with even more of a suicidal streak and youve got the general idea). About a year ago I first heard her 2000 covers album (helpfully entitled The Covers Record), and her latest album, You Are Free is getting played  ad nauseum  by selected fellow employees of the Borders music and video department. Like I said, her musics okay, but a bit overrated.   Anyway, on to the article I read this morningit was actually a review of her concert at the Somerville Theatre last Friday. The review required some backstory: apparently Her Catness canceled a sold-out show last year at the last minute, then blew off the rescheduled date. Shes known for this type of thing. Oh, these temperamental  artistes!  At her concert last week, she actually showed up, albeit in a dark corner behind the piano during the entire performance (oohhow  mysterious! )  Marshall/Powers erratic behavior tended to get worse as the show went on, as she forgot lyrics, abandoned some songs altogether, fumbled for long stretches between songs, etc etc etc. The kicker, for me anyway, was when she broke a fingernail (after about a third of the audience had already left, apparently) and asked if anyone wanted it. Some obsessed uber-fan apparently took her up on the offer and went home with a little piece of  Cat Power.  Its easy to blame the moronic, get-a-life behavior of this fan-cum-cuticle enthusiast, but Cat/Chan herself is to blame for encouraging this sort of thing. She actually suggested that there may be people in the audience who would want this fingernail. She has the gall to assume that her cuticles are worthy of praise and adulation.   Three words, Chan. Get. Over. Yourself.   Ill admit that there are artists out there I admire greatly who have a moody, mercurial personality that often translates to erratic behavior onstage and off.  urlLink Van Morrison  comes to mind. But you know what? Thats Van Fucking Morrison. If Cat Power were responsible for Astral Weeks, Moondance and Veedon Fleece, Id excuse the behavior. But otherwise, show up for your scheduled gigs and throw your nails in the trash like the rest of us commoners.   What the average rock star cant seem to get through his or her thick skull is that, despite what Bono tells you, rock stars are not going to change the world. Woodstock did not end the Vietnam War. Live Aid did not cure world hunger. John Lennon did not put a stop to people killing each other. Rock stars are entertainers, and many of them are capable of creating art that is beautiful and transcendental. As someone who owns roughly 850 CDs, it may seem strange for me to say this, but its just music. The people who create it are human beings. Cat Powers fingernails may have a bit of polish on them, but otherwise theyre just like mine. If you or I were scheduled to show up for a job interview and ended up blowing it off twice, there isnt a chance in hell we would get hired. Why should be accept the same behavior from a rock star?

       rain, beethoven and clean underwear   I really wish I had something wise and wonderful to share with you this afternoon, but it aint happening. Sorry. Its 2:38 on a Friday afternoon and Im sitting at my desk at work wishing I was at home or at Lizas or maybe watching a movie. This afternoon is dragging by more slowly than  urlLink The Godfather, Part III  (that was a cheap shot, by the way. I actually believe that  Sofia Coppolas acting notwithstanding -- GFIII is a pretty decent movie, it just pales in comparison to the first two).  Its absolutely pouring rain right now. One of the nicest things about my office is the fact that my cubicle has a really terrific view of the Boston skyline  although you wouldnt know that by looking outside now, since its all rainy and foggy. Good. Maybe itll wash away all this damn snow. You see, I consider myself a winter person. Kids love the snow and its something I never really outgrew. I also like cold weather, foggy weather, even rain (as long as I have an umbrella). But this winter has been so brutal that I actually am looking forward to the summer.   My sister Julie and I are going to see the  urlLink Handel and Haydn Society  perform Beethovens Ninth Symphony tomorrow afternoon. Julie is a budding classical music fan, and Ive been pretty serious about it myself for the past few years, so we both agreed to look out for affordable shows that we could both attend. She asked me about this particular event earlier today and I said sure. It should be fun, even though  as usual  Lizas work commitments will prevent her from joining us. But tomorrow night after Liza is done with work, she and I are going to see a movie. I have two Loews passes burning a hole in my pocket and for some reason she and I havent been to a movie in more than two months (which is really unusual for us).   I know that Im getting old when I get excited about the prospect of a new washer/dryer. But thats exactly whats happening. My roommate Frank (a fellow Borders employee) actually owns a washer/dryer that we both use in the basement of our triple-decker (no coins, no fuss  its paid for). The thing is, the current washer/dryer is 18 years old. Its a puny little stackable thing that is so old and impotent that it takes about three hours to dry one load of clothes. Im not exaggerating. Laundry may be free in our apartment, but its an excruciating undertaking. Until now. Well, let me back up. Last weekend I was hauling a pile of laundry down to the basement when I ran into our landlord, Joe (who lives on the third floor and has been busy prepping our currently-empty first floor for a prospective new tenant). He was busy replacing the exhaust tube thingie in our dryer when he informed me that Franks current appliance is not only completely ineffective as a drying mechanism (tell me something I dont know), but is also a potential fire hazard (okay! I didnt know that). I explained to Joe that Frank has been contemplating buying a new one, but is a little slow on technology updates. Frank, you see, is an intelligent, cultured, well-read man, but he also doesnt own a microwave oven or a computer, has probably never been on the internet and didnt know how to operate a CD player or even have cable TV until I moved in last year (no offense! Hes really a great guy). So the next day, as I was seeing how many quarters I had for the laundromat down the street, Frank informed me that he was indeed buying a new washer/dryer, to be installed on Friday afternoon. Huzzah! Saints be praised.   Oh, and in case you were wondering  Im still hip-deep in my ever-growing  urlLink King Crimson  CD collection. This morning I listened to the excellent THRAK CD on my way to work and I last night at work I was lucky enough to snag a promo copy of the EP Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With. Thanks not only to  urlLink Tom,  but also the infinitely cool folks over at  urlLink alt.music.mike-keneally  for their wisdom, honesty and exquisitely eclectic tastes.

       now playing   Every couple of days, I open up my neoprene CaseLogic 24-disc CD case and change the discs I have in there. I spend roughly two hours a day commuting to work, on the train, walking to the train, walking from the train to my office, etc. Music is my savior during these times. So I'm going to periodically post a "now playing" in order to give you an idea as to what music is floating through my headphones on that particular day. Raise your hand if you care. Yeah, that's what I thought. Here we go...  Murray Perahia: Bach English Suites 1, 3, 6 Richard Goode: Bach Partitas 1, 3, 6 Joshua Redman: Passage of Time Afghan Whigs: Black Love Supertramp: Crime of the Century John Coltrane: A Love Supreme (deluxe two-disc edition) Bill Evans: Finest Hour Charles Lloyd: Hyperion with Higgins Arthur Grumiaux: Bach Violin Sonatas and Partitas 1-3 King Crimson: In the Court of the Crimson King King Crimson: Starless and Bible Black King Crimson: Red Arthur Rubinstein: Beethoven Piano Sonatas 3, 27, 57 & 81a Pierre-Laurent Aimard: Messian  Vingt Regards Sur LEnfant Jesus Billy Bragg: William Bloke Peter Gabriel: 2 Ella Fitzgerald: Best of the Verve Song Books (Love Songs) Ella Fitzgerald: Best of the Verve Song Books (Ballads) Alain Planes: Haydn Sonatas Rossini: Sonate a Quattro Paolo Conte: Paolo Conte  There's a lot of jazz in there today, due to the fact that I'm reading  urlLink Lost Light  by Michael Connelly (see post below). Also, you'll notice a few King Crimson discs in there. If you've been reading the last couple of days you'll know that I'm just starting to discover these guys. I bought two discs from the current Adrian Belew era about a month ago ("Discipline" and "THRAK") and now I'm diving into the old stuff, particularly the early-mid seventies Fripp/Bruford/Wetton lineup. I love the Belew lineup's lean, exotic sound, but I have to admit that the brutal heaviness of the "Red" era is kicking my ass on a regular basis lately. Sometimes it's hard to put out of my mind the fact that that particular era featured the lead vocals of a man who would go on to sing with supercrappy prog-pop eighties supergroup Asia, but the stuff he did with KC (almost) redeems that. Last night I picked up "Starless and Bible Black," which is really amazing.

       now reading   In case you didn't already know it, I'm a huge fan of  urlLink Michael Connelly.  His new book is called "Lost Light" and I'm reading it right now (well not right at this moment, but...you know what I mean). I feel like whenever I read a Connelly book, I have to listen to jazz (one of his primary characters, Harry Bosch, is a big jazz fan). This morning on my way to work I was reading the book and had Joshua Redman's "Passage of Time" on the Walkman. Bill Evans also works well in this situation.

       red   Not much to post today. In my continuing quest to seek out the music of King Crimson, a band I've eluded for years, I bought their 1974 album  urlLink Red  last night. This is some heavy shit. I keep reading things in various places on the Internet that says Kurt Cobain loved this album to pieces, which makes perfect sense. Very loud, massive stuff. I've bought four KC albums in the last month or so, and this is the one that's really clicked with me right off the bat. Is Bill Bruford one of the greatest drummers in the history of rock music or what?

       the mellotron players wearing a cape   I hate to tell you this, but Im starting to develop a reemerging interest in  urlLink progressive rock.  Progressive, or prog as the kids call it today, used to be called art rock. Im glad its changed. Prog sounds more fun, which is a good thing, since that particular brand of music could certainly use a sense of humor in between all its ruminations on knights and swords and planets and starship troopers.    In the mid to late seventies, when I was a wee grade-school tyke, I was not lucky enough to be exposed to the revolutionary sounds of Elvis Costello, the Jam, the Clash, Joe Jackson or Talking Heads (that would take me a few more years). Instead, as my older brother and older sisters ruled over the turntable, our household was oblivious to the lean sounds of punk and was instead subjected to bands like Yes, Supertramp, Queen and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Im sorry to have to tell you that. Why am I apologizing? Well, progs gotten a bad rep over the years. Its completely uncool to even acknowledge this type of music. To put it in perspective, prog is the musical equivalent to reading fantasy novels and playing Dungeons & Dragons.   But as I get older I find that its not necessary for me to shun or ignore a type of music simply based on its dork factor. I know who I am. I dont need to tap my peers on the shoulder for approval. Plus, I think that the most important factor in an individuals musical taste is eclecticism. I not only like Elvis Costello, Los Lobos, Beck and Flaming Lips, but also Yes, Beethoven, Glenn Gould, Queen, Frank Sinatra, Horace Silver and Claude Bolling. I can listen to them all in one sitting. Some of those artists get a hard time due to their lack of being part of the  zeitgeist . But I dont care.   Lets take Yes, for example. Theyre one of the best-known prog bands of all time, and even though I really only enjoy three of their albums (The Yes Album, Fragile and Close to the Edge, released between 1970 and 1972), those are some damn good albums. There is some extremely engaging, well-played stuff going on there. Jethro Tulls Living in the Past is a great album too, as is Supertamps Crisis? What Crisis? (purists may not acknowledge them as prog, but I think they have managed to take the essence of prog and squeeze it quite nicely into the pop song format --- it's sort of a Beatlesque Prog), Queens Queen II (easily their proggiest moment), and Ill even go so far as to say that there are segments of Emerson, Lake & Palmers Brain Salad Surgery that I really like a lot.   I like to think that my obsession with he music of Frank Zappa, which started in the early eighties and continues to this day, is an extension of my prog leanings that never really went away, but Zappa is really in a class by himself. His music  particularly in the seventies  definitely had a prog side to it, but a lot of that was due to his interest and implementation of both classical and jazz.  Dont get me wrong  theres lots of prog out there that is bloated, pretentious and boring (the main criticisms of the genre). Theres a lot of it out there thats just too ungainly for me (like a lot of ELP) and some of it  call it teenyprog, if you will  is sugary and too pop-oriented (like Styx -- blecch). Also, almost all prog that attempts to fuse orchestras with rock bands is horrific and deserves all the ridicule its subjected to (why hire an orchestra when a mellotron will do?).   But if youre a music fan who wants to venture beyond the three-minute pop/rock single and isnt ashamed of listening to something totally uncool, you should try some of these bands. There are even current prog bands out there, like Spocks Beard, Porcupine Tree, Kings X (and I understand Tool is considered prog in some circles).   Hell, if Lord of the Rings can be cool again, why not these guys?    By the way, this whole rambling speech on prog rock was supposed to be a preamble to an essay on my recent discovery and current obsession of one of prog's originators, King Crimson. That will have to be a separate piece for another time. Soon.

       everybody's angular   My apologies to Sarah Rodman. Not only are her music articles one of the  urlLink Boston Herald's  few redeeming qualities, but I completely dissed her by saying (in my last post) that nobody bothered to review either of the two weekend  urlLink Joe Jackson  concerts at the Paradise. It turns out that Sarah wrote a review for the Friday show which appeared in the Sunday paper. It doesn't really seem worthwhile to give you a link to the review since you have to pay for Herald archives, dammit. But the review itself is very good and Sarah righted her previous wrong by giving Joe's correct age (48). We must have some sort of cosmic telepathic link, because she and I, without realizing it, both used the word "angular" when describing Joe's song "Fools in Love" (she called it "angular white boy funk," while I referred to it as "angular reggae").   urlLink April  posted something rather humorous the other day regarding life as a peon in the retail world. You should check it out. I can completely relate to what she's saying.   I have a bunch of rambling to do regarding some recent music purchases. Probably this afternoon. Stay tuned.

       we never leave the past behind, we just accumulate   It looks like its up to me to give you all a review of the Joe Jackson concert, since none of the Boston papers felt it was worthy of their time. Strange, especially since the  urlLink Herald  wrote a nice article about Joe earlier in the week.   As you probably already know, my sister Julie and I went to see  urlLink Joe Jackson  at the Paradise last Saturday. It was the second of two sold out shows he performed there over the weekend (the first one was Friday night). It was general admission, so we got there fairly early in order to get a good space up front (which we did  we were directly in front of Gary Sanford, the guitarist). The opening act was a band called  urlLink Mary Lee's Corvette actually a trio led by a female singer name Mary Lee Kortes. She sang and played acoustic guitar and was accompanied by a drummer and bass player (who looked like a stoned Albert Brooks and did this really weird walk/dance when he was playing that looked oddly gorilla-like). Their music sounded like something I wouldnt really care for (kind of country/folkish) but they were actually really good. Apparently last year (or maybe it was 2001) they made the extremely ballsy move of doing a cover album of Dylans  urlLink "Blood on the Tracks."  The entire album, song by song. They only did one song from that album (Youre Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go) but it sounded great.   The music played over the PA before the show was quite good. Its always interesting to hear what music the artist chooses to have playing before the band hits the stage. This mix was very appropriate for Joes fan base, I think. Lots of late seventies/early eighties punk/new wave. Ian Dury, Graham Parker, Nick Lowe, the Clashit was awesome. I was easily one of the youngest people in the audience. A lot of fortysomethings and graying fiftysomethings, even (fortunately I didnt see any male ponytails  what is it about aging hippies that makes them think the ponytail will somehow stop the aging process?).   What can I say about Joes set? He was fantastic. The band was simply astonishing. Its hard to believe that these guys havent played together since 1980. There was a tremendous amount of energy onstage. He played a bunch of new stuff (from the excellent new album, Vol. 4) in addition to lots of classics, borrowing heavily from his first two albums, Look Sharp and Im the Man.   For the most part, Joe stuck pretty close to the studio arrangements, with one notable exception: the angular reggae of Fools in Love was slowed down considerably, giving it a hypnotic, dirge-like quality. He even spiced it up by adding a segment of the Yardbirds For Your Love right in the middle of the song. In addition to the electric piano, Joe also found time to shake the maracas and broke out a  urlLink melodica  on a few songs. I love melodicas!  About halfway through the set, the band left the stage and Joe played four songs by himself on the piano. He did two originals (Stepping Out and a personal favorite of mine, Hometown  todays post title is a line from that song) in addition to two excellent covers (Steely Dans Any Major Dude Will Tell You and the Beatles Girl). Unfortunately, this part of the show also caused the biggest inconvenience for me and Julie, since a trio of inebriated tools (a guy and two girls) apparently didnt realize (or didnt seem to care) that their loud, drunken talking was getting in the way of a pretty quiet, intimate group of songs. I was about two seconds away from telling them to shut up until I realized that it probably would have made it worse (What? What? Why you want me to shut up? Issa free country, isnt it? Hey! What? Im not drunk! Cmere, Im gonna kick yer ass! Belch.)  The newer songs mixed in quite nicely with the old. Vol. 4 definitely sounds a lot like Look Sharp, but the ballads add a new dimension (reminiscent of his quiet 1982 masterpiece Night & Day). The wardrobe angle isnt really important, but I have to say that Joe really personified the attributes of dorky GQ. Thats the only way I can describe it. Black pinstripe suit, black shoes and white socks. I love it! And while he never really was a very attractive man, he was so pale he almost appeared translucent. I would have been concerned for his health, but judging by the amount of jumping around he was doing, Joe is apparently doing just fine.   The last several songs were definitely the highlight, energy-wise. Uptempo numbers like Dont Wanna Be Like That, Im the Man, Got the Time and Look Sharp were given an extra jolt thanks to the manic live setting.   Joe Jackson is one of those artists Ive been listening to for a long time but have never managed to see in concert. I can certainly cross him off the list, but I certainly hope its not the last time I see him!  Oh, and I got a nice t-shirt, even though  urlLink the one I really wanted  wasn't being sold at the gig like I originally thought.

       on joni and the art of waking up   I find as I get older I oversleep a lot less. In my early twenties I didnt exactly have a handle on the whole punctuality thing, mainly due to my increased love of carousing. Now that Im older and more boring, I find that getting up when the alarm actually goes off is much easier.   Not this morning. I finally crawled out of bed about an hour later than I was supposed to. First, let me explain my whole alarm/waking thing to you (can you tell I dont have anything particularly exciting to post today?). When I bought my cell phone, I threw my clock radio in the closet and began using the phone as an alarm. I also set my TV to turn on at the same time. I dont have any type of snooze feature to fall back on, but I feel this is a good thing. As a society, we are far too dependent on the Almighty Snooze. I know people who hit snooze for  over an hour  before actually getting up. This fitful hour of half-sleeping should not be construed as an extra hour of sleep. Rather, its 60 minutes of being awakened every nine minutes. Big difference.   My cell phone/TV alarm system works nicely. When I set them to go off (at 6:30 a.m.), I turn off the phone alarm but keep the TV on, so I can gently ease into the waking up process. The local news is on until seven, which gives me the opportunity to half-hear news reports under a haze of sleep (I cant tell you how many strange Iraq-related dreams Ive experienced lately).   Why am I telling you all of this? To kill time before I leave the office in a half-hour. Oh, and also to tell you that the reason for my oversleeping this morning was because I was hypnotized by a  urlLink PBS documentary on Joni Mitchell  the night before. I was getting ready to turn off the TV and go to bed when I did a cursory last flip around the channels and caught this very enjoyable and well-produced program on one of the most celebrated rock artists that Ive never really paid much attention to. Ive hesitated diving into Jonis music mainly because I get the feeling that shes influenced a lot of the "Lilith" crowd. I dont care for Sarah MacLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Mellisa Ferrick, Ani DiFranco, the Indigo Girls or anyone else in that category. Oh, and before you start writing to me, complaining that one of those artists is not like the others, etc, etc, keep in mind that I realize that it may come off as gross generalizations but I just dont care for the whole female folkie thing. I cant get into any of it. Im not misogynistic, I just dont like the music. Im sure theyre all nice people, but that doesnt mean I have to buy their albums.    But Joni strikes me as completely different. First of all, she was doing it long before anyone else, and second of all (and I know this because I saw a show about it last night), she has always been a tireless musical experimentalist. Just when you thought you were safe with her vocals and acoustic guitar, she makes albums with jazz alums like Jaco Pastorious, Tom Scott and the great Charles Mingus. She was doing world music long before it was hip. Hugely talented artists as diverse as Elvis Costello and Prince(!) have cited her as a major influence. So I think its time I investigate this womans music more thoroughly. If any seasoned Joni-philes out there can give me some recommendations, Id be glad to get your input. The address is at the top of the page.   This should be a fun weekend. Saturday night my sister Julie and I are going to dinner and then catching  urlLink Joe Jackson  at the Paradise. Yay for Joe! Sunday were going up to New Hampshire to visit our other sister Karen and her kids, Mike and Lauren. Old-school New Wavers on one day, kickin back with the fam on the next.   Oh, and some bittersweet news: Liza has been accepted to a  urlLink semester abroad program  in Holland. Its a great opportunity for her and Im extremely happy for her. But now I have to figure out what to do with myself from September to December. Oh, and if there's any young Dutch guys reading this, keep your hands off my woman.   Have a great weekend and remember to "spring forward."

       two days to joe   Despite the fact that both UPS and the shipping & receiving department of my office almost prevented me from doing so (long story), I will be attending the  urlLink Joe Jackson  concert this Saturday night. My old friend Jamie, who was originally going to attend with me (and therefore purchased the tickets online back in February), has family obligations this weekend, as does his lovely wife Debbie. So he mailed the tickets to me from Connecticut. Theyre in my hands. Im going with my sister Julie (Liza, my eternal concert cohort, will be working Saturday night). Life is good. I was originally going to take my vinyl copy of  urlLink "Look Sharp"  in the hopes that Joe himself could put his Joe Hancock on it, but Im wondering if a cardboard LP sleeve could possibly survive a sold-out crowd at the tiny-but-mighty  urlLink Paradise Rock Club.  So Im not sure what, if anything, I will bring to the show besides me and my ticket.   In related news, there's a nice  urlLink article  about Joe in today's Boston Herald. My only complaint is that the usually-dependable Sarah Rodman erroneously gave Joe's age as 54 (he's 48).

       judy blume for president   I dont remember how it started, but sometime today I began thinking about Judy Blume. You know, the woman who wrote all those childrens books (and a few for adults as well). Anyway, I began snooping around the Internet and I found a nice little  urlLink essay  she wrote about Harry Potter and censorship. I used to love her for her books. Now I love what she thinks about censorship, too.   The first time I ever read Judy Blume was in fourth grade, when it was actually read to my class. Our teacher, Mrs. Robinson, read us Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great and (naturally) Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. At the time, I was a full-fledged fan of both  urlLink Tintin  comic books (I was living in France at the time) and the  urlLink Hardy Boys.  I gobbled those suckers up one after another. But the Blume books were a wonderful diversion, not unlike throwing on a silly chick flick or angst-ridden ensemble comedy after living on a diet of espionage films.   A couple of years later when my parents were going through a divorce, my mother gave me a copy of Its Not the End of the World, another Blume book, this time chronicling the ups and down of a young girl (who was probably about my age at the time) dealing with the split of her parents. I found the book engaging and quite touching, and in some parts it hit close to home a bit more than I wanted it to. On a different note, I really liked the main characters best friend, a brainy pre-teen who enjoys reading the Sunday New York Times in its entirety. Im 34 and I cant even do that.   In the eighth grade, I read Then Again, Maybe I Wont, which is probably one of my favorite books from childhood. A young boy (again, about my age), moves with his family to a fancy neighborhood after his father gets a big promotion. He meets new friends, still feels out of place, and to top it all off, he develops an enormous crush on a girl next door who has a habit of undressing with her shades open. Holy crap! Talk about tapping into the neurosis of a young pre-teen boy. Its probably the only book for this age group that hints at the subject of, well self-love.  I know for a fact that at least a couple of Blumes books were banned, and this is probably one of them. Why is that? Well, nobody is gunned down or raped in this book, but a young boy does in fact commit the unpardonable sin of getting a hard-on (sorry! Off the soapbox!).  Theres not really much point to this post, just a stroll down memory lane, and a reminder that  not to sound like an old fart  it may be a good idea for you parents out there to encourage recreational reading. Judy Blume is just one example, but a damn good one.

       michael jeter r.i.p.   In case you hadn't already heard, character actor Michael Jeter  urlLink passed away  two days ago at age 50.   Those of you who read my post on the recently deceased Lynne Thigpen a few weeks ago know how much I admire character actors, and Jeter was one of the best. A lot of people know him for his Emmy-winning work on the TV show "Evening Shade," as well as films like "Sister Act 2" and "The Green Mile," but to me, he'll always be the homeless cabaret singer in Terry Gilliam's brilliant film  urlLink "The Fisher King."  The scene where he delivered the singing telegram to Amanda Plummer was, in my opinion, the funniest scene in a very funny movie.

       my whilrwind arizona weekend   Do you live in the greater Phoenix area? Did you happen to witness somebody singing  urlLink Joe Jackson  songs very loudly from a Toyota Corolla on the highway last Saturday night? That was me. Liza and I were on vacation in Phoenix and had just come from a wedding and I was, technically speaking, three sheets to the wind. We went to the wedding of her friend Jeremy, which actually took place on a rented mansion in the nearby city of Mesa. The ceremony was lovely. The dinner was outstanding. The DJs started a bit shaky (their pre-dinner music consisted of a lot of Kenny G and other smooth-jazz stuff, which worried Liza and I), but soon settled into a nice mix that got even the most jaded guests on the floor doing the white mans overbite. The bar was, wellopen. If theres anything that gets me to act like a raving lunatic, its free booze. Fortunately I didnt start really pounding em down until near the end of the night, so only a small amount of people actually witnessed my extreme inebriation, including, God bless her, Lizawho was the unlucky sole audience member during my attempt at turning the Corolla into a karaoke bar on the way home (I distinctly remember singing Is She Really Going Out With Him in addition to the Jams Thats Entertainment.) Later, once in the confines of her parents home where we were staying, I emptied my stomach contents into the Arizona septic system (thankfully drowned out by the Chicago soundtrack, which Lizas father  also inebriated  insisted on playing rather loudly). Next-day hangovers prevented us from attending the Tempe Art Festival as originally planned, so we rented the Albert Brooks movie  urlLink "Mother"  instead. Lizas father suggested I try some red beer  beer and tomato juice  to cure my aching head. I said no thanks and continued swilling Gatorade and moaning.   Despite that last paragraph, my trip to Arizona was not really an alcohol-tainted lost weekend. Liza and I spent quality time with her neice and nephew doing the babysitting thing on Friday, followed by an incredible family dinner at the  urlLink Fish Market.  Saturday morning we went on a hike with her parents' dog Spike (a cruel reminder of what terrible physical shape Im in). Sunday night felt just like home as we all tuned in to brand-new episodes of  urlLink "Law & Order: Criminal Intent"  and  urlLink "Boomtown."   Unfortunately, we were all rudely awakened the next morning at 4 a.m. by the sound of our alarm clocks  our flight left at 6:30. Despite the fact that I still hate flying, and we were on  three  separate planes (Phoenix to Denver to Chicago to Boston), yesterday wasnt quite so bad. I finished reading  urlLink A Cure for Gravity,  which is not only an amazing book, but is also getting me completely pumped up for this Joe Jackson concert on Saturday.

       fun with toy cars, etc   A couple of weeks ago,  urlLink Tom's site  mentioned  urlLink this website,  which has to be one of the silliest things I've seen on the internet in quite some time. Last week when I was visiting my sister Karen in lovely Derry, New Hampshire, we all piled into her minivan (Liza, Karen, my other sister Julie, my brother Gary, my nephew Mike, my niece Lauren and her boyfriend Brian) and headed out to  urlLink Wal-Mart.  How very suburban! While there, I noticed an enormous tub o'matchbox cars for something like 65 cents apiece. After what seemed like an eternity, I finally decided on a lovely burgundy Mercedes convertible to use for my photo. I finally held the photo shoot this afternoon,  here in my cubicle (which looks out onto the beautiful Boston skyline, but also -- more importantly, in this case -- onto the roof of an adjacent parking garage).  I submitted a photo to the site this afternoon and if it makes it onto the site, well hey -- you'll all be the first to know.   This weekend should be fun. Tonight my sister Julie and I are going to catch Liza's semi-annual dance performance at BU's Tsai Performance Center. The show is usually about two hours long and consists of some pretty interesting stuff (except for some of the modern dance numbers, which always seem to last forever). But of course Liza's hip-hop group will kick their collective asses.  Saturday night Julie and I are going to see the always entertaining  urlLink John Wesley Harding  at  urlLink Club Passim.  Hopefully I'll get to say hello to him before or after the show. He's definitely one of the cooler semi-famous people I've met.   Have a great weekend. Do yourself a favor: rent a movie with no special effects, buy a CD of a band that never gets played on the radio, and check out the weblogs listed in my links section. Those are all things that are very good for you, I promise.

       edward norton, you're disappointing me   There's several reasons why I have no interest in seeing "The Italian Job." It's a remake (an unfortunate trend in the creatively bankrupt 21st century), it's one of those "boys with toys" action movies, and, perhaps most of all...I see commercials for it about every thirty seconds. Christ, what is the marketing budget of this damn film? Does it rival the gross national product of small European countries?   Maybe the movie could serve as a metaphor for oversaturated ad campaigns. You know, if a film gets way too much publicity, you could say it's been "Italian Jobbed." I can picture it now: "Dude, I was going to see 'Bruce Almighty,' but jeez, they've totally Italian Jobbed it. Enough with the ads already."  And yeah, as the title of this post implies, I think that Edward Norton -- a fabulous actor -- needs to be a bit more choosy in his roles ("25th Hour" notwithstanding). He's running the risk of becoming the Nicolas Cage of the new millenium.

       i am trying to write a review   In April 2003,  urlLink Wilco  released  urlLink "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"  which to me was easily the best album Id heard all year. It was also an album that had more of a backstory than any release in recent memory.   First of all, the band started recording it shortly after firing their original drummer, Ken Coomer. Then, conflicts between co-leaders Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett came to head and Jay was asked to leave. To top it all off, when the finished product was delivered to Reprise Records, the company  after a considerable period of silence and collective head-scratching  asked the boys to make the album more commercial sounding. Tweedy  Wilcos singer and principal songwriter  said no way. Reprise dropped them from their label, and the band had a finished album but nobody to release it.   Eventually, after shopping around to different labels, Nonesuch Records agreed to take them on and release YHF as is, with no alterations whatsoever. Nonesuch is somewhat of an avant-garde label, known primarily for classical and world music. And get this  theyre a subsidiary of Time-Warner, just like Reprise. So I guess that means that Warner Brothers rejected the album and then bought it back. Ha!    Wouldnt it have been great if someone had filmed this whole soap opera? Well, guess what  they did.  urlLink I Am Trying To Break Your Heart   is billed as a film about Wilco, but its really the story behind this fantastic album that the general public almost didnt get the chance to hear.   Sam Jones  a magazine photographer who had never shot a film before this one  was given almost total access to the band during rehearsals, recording sessions, and various concert dates. All the while he gives us interviews with all concerned, even one Reprise executive (the only one willing to talk, apparently). You get to see firsthand Tony Margherita, Wilco's manager, on his cellphone as he first hears the news that Reprise doesn't want to release the album. There are a few verbal tiffs caught on camera, including a memorable one between Tweedy and Bennett arguing over how a particular track should be mixed. They dont actually raise their voices, but the tension is palpable and is a harbinger of things to come. Tweedy is apparently a quiet man who lets his music do the talking, and when he does perform onstage and on camera, his talent and charisma are obvious. The whole band, in fact, kicks ass in this film, whether rocking out with Im Always in Love or an electric version of Kamera, or working their way through an early, gorgeous version of Jesus, Etc.   One of the reasons  I assume  that Reprise refused the album is its experimental bent. While the band hadnt abandoned their country-tinged, no-frills rock and roll roots, the sounds on YHF are supplemented by bits of radio static, unusual instrumentation, and the occasional primal scream moment. As a die-hard fan of this album for the past year, I was delighted to see where it all took place, especially witnessing the odd assortment of steel drums, antique keyboards and vintage guitars that make up the albums sonic landscape.   The DVD is packed with extras. In addition to an extra disc of additional performances and a few silly, throwaway scenes, theres a short documentary called I Am Trying To Make a Film (a documentary about a documentary?) and an excellent, insightful and often hilarious audio commentary featuring Sam Jones and Wilco (who cryptically exit the sound booth when Jones discusses the above-mentioned mixing fiasco between Tweedy and Bennett).    One of the journalists interviewed in the film explains that this is not VH1: Behind the Music, in other words  its not about celebrity rock stars or drug overdoses. Its about the music. Its about a genuinely talented bunch of musicians making a fantastic album. In black and white.

       how to act like a tourist   My luxurious four-day vacation has come and gone, but the way things worked out, I got to come back on a Friday, act all Friday-like (i.e., do as little as possible), and then go home to a three-day weekend. So its not all bad.   As I told you all before, my brother Gary was in town for a few days, visiting from Florida. He arrived on Sunday, where he was greeted at the airport by his three siblings (me, Karen, Julie). After his bag was lost by the airline (or the airport, I dont know whose area of irresponsibility this particular act really falls on), we collectively shrugged, gave the airline/airport my sisters address and asked them to pretty please deliver the fucking bag as soon as possible, mkay? We picked up Liza at her dance studio and ended up catching  urlLink "Stomp,"  which I saw about six years ago and am still amazed.   Other fun things we did:   Spent most of Monday in lovely  urlLink Derry, New Hampshire,  where my sister Karen lives (and where I spent a few disorienting high school summers back in those crazy 80s)  Checked out a brand-new, slightly touristy, crazily retro new bowling alley-pool hall-bar called Kings (twice)   Sat in the bleachers of  urlLink Fenway Park  for a Red Sox/Yankees game (look for my essay of a sociological bent on this journey sometime next week)   Walked all over hell and back to find a bar called  urlLink The Barking Crab,  only to find out that the kitchen was closed and the band that was supposed to be playing there actually wasnt  Visited the  urlLink JFK Library  (for free, since lots of museums are offering free admission to  urlLink Fleet  cardholders during the month of Maywhee!)  Was treated to an amazingly amazing lunch at  urlLink Legal Seafood  courtesy of my sister Julie  Put away a few beers at  urlLink J.J. Foley's   Saw  urlLink "A Mighty Wind"   Listened to  urlLink Bill Hicks  CDs with Gary and Liza in my apartment at 1 a.m.  There was only one major goal of the trip that was unfulfilled, and that was to see a live band. There were really no decent bands (that I know of) playing during my brothers stay. The only exception to that was my co-worker Jims band,  urlLink The Secret Channel , but we were seeing Stomp the night they played. Overall, Id have to say that the week was a smashing success and everyone was happy (except for that damn lobster I had at the Summer Shack, whose claws kept stabbing me).  No major plans for this weekend, but I think I may take advantage of this free museum thing and check out the  urlLink MFA  after work today.    Have a lovely weekend. Ill be back on a regular posting schedule next Tuesday. In the meantime, read this interesting  urlLink article  article by Joe Jackson.

       the bro touches down in t-minus 45 hours   This has been a pretty lame week for posting and I apologize. Things have been pretty hectic at work, especially since I won't be here next week (except for Friday). You see, my brother is coming to town. Did you hear that? I said my brother's coming to town!!   That's right...Gary, a/k/a The Gary, a/k/a Jumpin' Junior, will be in Boston and that's a very, very good thing. Actually, Gary is going through some extremely shitty personal issues right now (which I won't get into), so my mother paid for him to fly up here to be with his siblings for a few days. Our only concrete plans are to see  urlLink Stomp  on Sunday, head up to New Hampshire on Monday to see the neice and nephew (our sister Karen's kids) and perhaps a raucous sibling dinner with Julie and Karen on Monday night (if Gary and I have our way, we'll attempt to rekindle old childhood memories by bringing along some rusty old prog rock for dinner music). Everything else is wide open and will probably involve listening to copious amounts of music and perhaps the consumption of some alcohol.   My roommate Frank is going to be in New York during Gary's visit (he doesn't have anything against Gary, it just worked out that way), so we've got the place to ourselves. Tomorrow I believe I'll be getting a crash course in Cleaning The House Frank's Way. Frank, you see, is a bit of a fanatic about cleanliness. I used to think I was a neat freak until I moved in with Frank. Now I bow before the master and this weekend, Sensei will show Grasshopper how it's done.   Posting will in all likelihood not happen before next Friday, unless I happen to stumble upon a computer and the inspiration hits me. So have a great week and I'll see you all back here in a few days.

       the long honeymoon   I don't mean to get all People Magazine on you, but this is Elvis Costello, after all.  urlLink The Man  is apparently  urlLink engaged  to jazz singer/pianist  urlLink Diana Krall.  I'm not really a huge DK fan, but I've heard some her stuff and she seems quite talented (not like he needs my approval or anything). I read somewhere that she never heard any of his music before they met. That doesn't really surprise me. I mean, come on. Can you really picture Diana Krall cranking up  urlLink "Armed Forces?"   (Thanks to  urlLink palmermix  for hooking me up with the EC/DK link)

       robert stack, r.i.p.   Robert Stack is  urlLink dead.  Although my generation will always remember him as the host of  urlLink "Unsolved Mysteries"  and to my parents he'll forever be known as Eliot Ness in TV's  urlLink "The Untouchables,"  I'll always have a special place in my heart for his work as the voice of Agent Flemming in  urlLink "Beavis and Butthead Do America."  "Full body cavity search. Go deep on 'em!" That will always make me laugh.

       box sets and john cusack    I'm basically broke until Thursday, and it's all my fault. I decided to blow 42 bucks (it would have been 58 bucks if not for my Borders employee discount) on a box set. A  urlLink really nice one.  So I take full responsibility, and it's tuna sandwiches for the next two days. Actually, I have some money set aside for tomorrow night. It's date night! The only weeknight that Liza and I both normally have off is Wednesday, so we usually hang out together and watch  urlLink Law & Order.  We'll probably eat at Anna's Taqueria, since it rocks so much.    The Mozart box set that I purchased last night was sort of spur-of-the-moment, I guess. The other day I was listening to a two-disc Mozart compilation CD that I'd had for the past couple of years and really enjoyed a piano sonata that was on it (No. 14 in C-Minor, K. 457 for you purists). So I went out and got them all. Plus all the piano variations. Eight discs of Mozart piano and nothing else. And it sounds just wonderful. If you enjoy 18th century piano masterpieces, well for crying out loud, get this.    I didn't post a report on my weekend yesterday, choosing instead to rant vehemently about my hatred for P. Puffy Diddley Combs. I was owed some comp time at the old day job, so I left work about two hours early on Friday afternoon, joined Liza for some Starbucks and then got my haircut. I've been a slave to the Supercuts machine for some time now, but my friend and co-worker Dave convinced me to support local businesses and try out his favorite place, La Flamme in Harvard Square. It's supposedly the oldest barbershop in the Boston area (or something like that). "JFK got his hair cut there," Dave said helpfully. So I went there. And got my hair cut. Nice place. I'll be going again. I didn't see any autographed photo of JFK, but there was one of Mike Dukakis.    Sunday night Liza and I went to the movies and saw  urlLink "Identity."  Not bad, but not fantastic. Despite the fact that he was in "Con Air" and "Serendipidy,"  urlLink John Cusack  is still one of my favorite actors and whenever he happens to appear in a crappy movie, he always manages to rise above it. This was not necessarily the case as "Identity" really wasn't bad. Lots of gratuitous horror movie cliches, but they were pretty effective.

       dougie's got a brand new blog   New link alert! Doug Boucher now has a blog and it's called, strangely enough,  urlLink pisshiver.  Like me, Dougie is a proud member of the esteemed group of music nerds who do lots of pontificatin' over at  urlLink alt.music.mike-keneally,  which is where I also found  urlLink Tom Johnson  and  urlLink drumzspace.  Anyway, Dougie's site is brand new and very, very entertaining. Big topics of discussion thus far: music (of course), his lovely daughter Katie (of course) and his recent tonsillectomy (ouch). Check it out.

       why are his fifteen minutes taking so long?   Puff Daddy or P. Diddy or whatever the hell he's calling himself, annoys the crap out of me every time he opens his mouth. Courtesy of the Boston Herald:   Apparently, Hollywood It Boy Ashton Kutcher and P. Diddy, who hung out at the Celtics-Nets game the other night, fancy themselves the new Rat Pack.    The dynamic duo have been each other's constant companions on both coasts.    ``We're the new Rat Pack, baby,'' P. told US Weekly.    Ashton and the erstwhile Puff Daddy have been spotted dining together at Kutcher's L.A. eatery, Dolce, clubbing at Vinyl in La-La and at the Goddess Gala in NYC.   Hey asshole, how about paying more attention to your pseudo-music career instead of concentrating on wearing the right jewelery, getting out of the right limos and getting into the right clubs. Even your fellow members of the hip-hop community think you're a joke. "We're the new Rat Pack, baby." Shut the hell up already.

       mac fashions   Can someone please tell me why Apple CEO  urlLink Steve Jobs  insists on wearing nothing but those riduclous black mock turtle necks all the time (usually accompanied by a pair of jeans that supposedly makes him think that he's just a hip computer geek like you and me)? The guy's a multi-zillionaire, you figure he could afford to spice up the wardrobe a bit. Come on Steve, take a trip to  urlLink Banana Republic  or something.

       is it just me?    This Illinois high school  urlLink hazing incident  has me so baffled I don't even know what to think. Stunned and disgusted come to mind. What bothers me almost as much as the actions themselves are the attitudes toward the participants and the locals in the aftermath. Adults in the area are upset not at the suffering of innocent minors, but that their school's repuatation will never be the same. The kids -- not necessarily those who participated, mind you -- are wondering why everyone's making such a stink. I heard some kid on the news say, "I don't understand the big deal. So some girl's head got split open. It's not like she died or anything." I didn't make up that quote. Some kid actually said that.   Local law enforcement types, as well as school board members, are scratching their collective heads over the whole affair. "We're not sure how to pursue this," the local Barney Fifes have the gall to say. How to pursue it? Kids have had their bones broken, they've been punched, kicked, strangled, lost consciousness and had to have stitches. How about throwing some people in jail, you morons? Are we worried about prosecuting the children of rich and affluent townspeople? Grow some balls, Northbrook.

       boulez and gawande   Jason, a guy I work with at Borders, asked me if I wanted to check out a free lecture at Harvard this Friday featuring  urlLink Pierre Boulez.  I'll be the first to admit that 90 percent of it would be completely over my head, but it might be interesting, so why the hell not. I'm not intimately familiar with Boulez' music, but what little I've heard (the piano sonatas) interests me a great deal. I may pick up  urlLink this  or  urlLink this  before the week is done so I can at least try to look like I know what they're talking about.   Yesterday I read a fantastic article in last week's New Yorker about  urlLink Francis Moore,  a medical maverick who created huge innovations in organ transplants and surgical methods in his long and varied career. Unfortunately he shot himself in 2001 at the age of 88. The article details his life and work and is extremely interesting. The article's author, Atul Gawande, is a doctor himself who wrote a book entitled  urlLink "Complications."  I started reading it last night.   Does it seem to you like I'm not in the mood to post? That's probably because I'm not. Sorry.

       on the bubble   I dont consider myself a huge fan of prime-time network television  theres just so much junk out there -- but there are a small number of shows that I watch regularly. Well, four, actually:  urlLink "Law & Order"  (and its two spin-offs) and  urlLink "Boomtown"  (I will occasionally watch  urlLink "The West Wing,"  but I have to admit that their smug, sanctimonious liberalism is sometimes too much even for this die-hard liberal). I was mildly shocked and more than a little disappointed when I learned that the excellent Boomtown is on the bubble for next seasons line-up. Thats industry jargon for its not a huge success, so it may or may not be renewed. Thus Boomtown may be joining steaming piles of dung like My Big Fat Greek Life and Good Morning, Miami in the heap of discarded shows. Whats wrong with this picture?  Apparently I dont keep up on the Nielsen ratings, because I was under the impression that Boomtown was a huge success. But its only the critics who love the show, because the general viewing audiences are too busy falling over themselves to get to whatever new reality TV craze is sweeping the nation.  Reality TV, from what I can remember, started with MTVs The Real World. While I found the show (and MTV in general) more than a little grating, I appreciated the concept. It was an interesting sociological experiment. But umpteen seasons later, the show has run its course and has become a parody of itself. While they purport to use a random sampling of roommates, its obvious as dirt that they are scrambling for a cookie-cutter demographic. Theres always The Minority, The Lesbian, The Extrovert, The Square, etc etc etc. Booooring.  While The Real World stopped becoming interesting about halfway through its first season (more than ten years ago), reality TV is riding high in the new millennium. For the life of me, I cant understand why. The subjects of these shows are either brainless studs or brainless bimbos, sporting a horrible fakenbake tan and trying so hard to be as hip as possible while sporting the IQ of a goldfish. These are all stupid people, leading shallow, materialistic lives, all the while enlisting the aid of a team of nitwit TV producers to help them search for a stupid, shallow, materialistic soul mate. Who needs the intricate plotting and stellar acting talents of a show like Boomtown when we can all follow Mr. And Mrs. Moron on their quest for true love?   Or maybe we could follow the Morons on their enriching quest to win heaps of money by simply performing the daredevil tasks assigned to them by the producers and host of Fear Factor. But wait! Theres some Morons out there who want to mate with other Morons, but must first face the wrath of their parents! So lets copy the plot of a marginally funny movie and crank out a series! Do the lie detector thing! Thatll get some laughs, especially when the tech shows everyone that the subject is lying by flashing the grim thumbs down! Ha! Stop! Its too funny!  I have an idea. Rename Boomtown to make it sound like a new reality show. Who Wants to Go To Boomtown? No? How aboutMeet My Boomtown? Or maybe Donnie Wahlbergs Showcase of Dirty Cops? That way, itll be sure to make the cut for the next season.

       who says you can't buy trust?   I forgot to mention that I stopped by the  urlLink Newbury Comics  on Newbury Street last Friday afternoon (as I often do) and after much perusing, I finally picked up a used copy of the Rykodisc reissue of Elvis Costello's stellar  urlLink "Trust"  album, which I find to be his second best, right behind the incomparable  urlLink "Get Happy!!"    As you may know, all my Elvis Costello discs were stolen from my apartment almost two years ago (along with all my Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, Bob Marley and Van Morrison), and I've been working hard at rebuilding the collection. Fortunately,  urlLink Rhino  has been hard at work reissuing EC's catalog with deluxe two-disc versions of all his titles. Unfortunately, it's not happening fast enough, and as a result, I broke down and bought the single-disc Rykodisc reissue of "Trust," which Rhino has yet to reissue. My impatience was justified the second I placed the disc in my Walkman and hit "play." This, my friends, is one terrific album, one that brings to mind spring break 1987 in Palos Verdes, California with my friend Goran (for me, anyway), and combines a frenetic Attractions with Elvis' smart-ass vocalizing and some of the best lyrics of his glorious career. And while Ryko isn't as heavy on the bonus tracks as Rhino, what they did was still impressive, especially the killer original arrangement of "Big Sister's Clothes," simply entitled "Big Sister." So what if EC blatantly ripped off "Under My Thumb," it still sounds great.

       streamlining the collection   Every once in a while I like go through my ever-growing collection of CDs and do a little pruning. Getting rid of stuff I never listen to. Sunday morning I did just that. I accumulated 33 discs that are either no longer relevant in my life or have been replaced by superior reissued versions. Then I put them in a bag and went downtown, specifically to  urlLink CD Spins  on Winter Street.   A lot of people I know prefer taking their discs to Newbury Comics or Strawberries (you get more money for your discs at those locations), but to me, the advantage of CD Spins is that they take ANYTHING. Seriously. If I want to unload the  urlLink Arrested Development  CD that I thought was so cool back in 1992 that I never even touch in 2003, or if Ive decided that the  urlLink MTV 120 Minutes compilation   that I thought made me so indie ten years ago is now an embarrassment, Im secure in the knowledge that CD Spins will take them all off my hands.   For all the discs I brought in yesterday, they offered me $39.50 in cash or $55 in store credit. Seeing as though their selection is mediocre at best (which makes sense, since they take anything), I opted for the cashola, and then blew a small portion of it down the street at my very own  urlLink Borders  where I work part-time. I was originally planning to get the  urlLink Schoenberg piano CD  that Ive been craving for some time, but I finally settled instead for one of those lovely Trojan reggae box sets, specifically the  urlLink Rocksteady  volume. Ive been letting my reggae collection wither on the vine for the last few years and this is an attempt to rectify that.    Afterwards I headed over to Harvard Square, where the HMV is closing on May 10. Its too bad, since that location was a great store that featured quite possibly the best selection of classical music in the city. Not anymore! Now that the place is closing, everything in the store is 40 percent off, giving the place a sad, desperate, "Filenes Basement" feel, with bargain-hungry customers running around the place, scooping up whatever they can find. I was sad to see that the classical section was particularly decimated. Fortunately I was able to pick up the excellent  urlLink Clockwork Orange soundtrack.   Seriously, if you're looking for a bargain, check out that HMV before they close the doors next weekend.

       Porkchop: Behind the Music    I got an e-mail from my friend Jamie Salafia this afternoon, basically complaining that I never mention him on my blog. To be honest, Jamie, most of the cast of characters who make a regular appearance on pressure drop are people Im in touch with on a daily basis (Liza, my sister, etc). But maybe I can dig into the recesses of my past and come up with an interesting anecdote or two.    Jamie Salafia is probably one of my closest, dearest friends. We met in the summer of 1992 when we were both in the military (he in the air force, me in the navy). We were both stationed in Keflavik, Iceland, working as broadcast journalists (and please dont ask me if I ever went on the radio and said Gooood morning Iceland! Its a stupid question, everyone asks it, but for the record: no, I never did that). Jamie and I had recently become married men. Not to each other: he, to the lovely Debbie, and me, to my (now ex-) wife Cynda.   Jamie and I were also friends with several other fellow military journalists, including an unusual fellow named Gerard Johnson. I really dont know where to begin with Gerard. Hes from South Dakota and is the youngest of something like thirteen kids. Hes extremely hyper and rarely lets anyone else in the room speak. He reminds me a little of Kramer from Seinfeld.   Gerard is also an accomplished guitarist and drummer. As a lapsed drummer myself, we decided to try forming a band (I was conveniently able to use Gerards drum set while he concentrated on the guitar). One of our stations technicians was a guy named Wade Martin, who not only played bass, but owned a Rickenbacker bass! Very cool. Wade was in the band in a heartbeat.   I dont know exactly how Jamie came to be in the band, but one thing led to another and this guy who doesnt really know how to sing was suddenly a singer. Keep in mind that when I say Jamie cant sing, hell be the first to agree. But we all had roughly the same taste in music, we all got along, so what the hell. Madonna cant sing either (see Tuesdays rant).   A band name was in order. An early contender for a name was Go Meinhold, our subversive way of paying tribute to Keith Meinhold, a Navy submariner who admitted on national television that he was a homosexual (this was during the beginnings of the whole dont ask, dont tell era). But we chickened out, and eventually settled on the name Porkchop. Our standard answer whenever people asked us why we used that name was that it was Homer Simpsons favorite food.   We used to rehearse at this quonset hut/rec room-type facility that was located literally in the middle of nowhere, somewhere between the bases airfield and the USO. We eventually hammered out a setlist consisting of some relatively safe alternative fare from the 80s and 90s. Some of the songs included In Between Days by the Cure (due to our lack of a keyboard player, Gerard played the keyboard riff on a kazoo), These Important Years by Husker Du, Suedehead by Morrissey, I Melt With You by Modern English (that was to be our set closer, if Im not mistaken  I have videotape of us rehearsing that song and Jamie is writhing on the floor during the final choruses), Alive by Pearl Jam (early nineties, anyone?), Ma and Pa by Fishbone (a song Ive always loved, but we could never really nail the tempo, in my opinion), Its the End of the World As We Know It by Jamies favorite band, REM (we had an interesting arrangement of this song  we did the first verse extremely slow and then repeated it at the regular frenetic pace  we were so damn cool), Here Comes Your Man by the Pixies and Kill Your Television by Neds Atomic Dustbin, a song whose ass I happen to think we totally kicked.   Overall, we didnt really practice as much as we should, and as a result I have to say that we achieved moments of occasional above-average musicianship but thats about it. Jamie wasnt much of a singer, but he had spirit and the four of us had lots and lots of laughs during those rehearsals. We never seemed to know how to end songs properly and I remember when I came up with the idea of melding Suedehead and Alive into a medley, it must have taken us all afternoon to try and pull that off.   The band went through phases of activity and inactivity throughout 1993, but we never really got a gig. We were just permanently rehearsing. At one point, however, there was a base talent show sponsored by the USO, and we jumped at the chance, but not before making a few unorthodox band changes that may or may not have contributed to our shame and eventual demise.   First of all, we hired fellow navy journalist Terry Welch (a.k.a.  urlLink Nitpicker ), a very cool, funny, and blazingly intelligent fellow, to be our second guitarist. The thing is, Terry couldnt really play. So we just kept him really low in the mix (he was known as our  urlLink Stu Sutcliffe ).  Second of all, we decided to audition for the talent show with an original song. Kiss of death, I know, but we wanted to prove that we werent just  musicians,  but  songwriters  too.  So we (actually Jamie and Gerard) ended up writing a song called What About Brandon, which was a spoof of Beverly Hills, 90210. Jamie wrote the caustic lyrics and Gerard set it to rather generic, grungy music (even throwing in a bit of the shows theme song into his guitar solo). At the last minute, however, we decided to add a second original song (really short, kind of tacked on to the end) to make it a sort of Porkchop Medley.   The second song was called Henrys Theme, named after an Icelandic barber on the base who owned his own shop and had a propensity for hittin the sauce, if you know what I mean. Henry cut a mean head of hair, but you had to watch out for those DTs when youve got sharp instruments in that area. He also had dirty magazines in his waiting area. Not Playboy, mind you. Im talking about publications with titles like Juggs and Cumshot. In the barbershop. In plain view. Henry also gave little cards to his customers and would punch a hole in it every time you got your hair cut. The tenth one was free. The sign outside his store said: Henrys Barbershop: You Get What You Pay For.  Does this guy need a theme song or what? We loved Henry, so we wrote a totally punked-up song about him, called it Henrys Theme (inspired by REMs Walters Theme). Using all those quirks as a guide, I wrote the lyrics:   You walk in the door, dirty magazines. Henrys hung over, but the tenth ones free.    Henrys! You get what you pay for. Henrys! You get what you pay for. Henrys! You get what you pay for. Dont move or Ill fuck it up!   We actually changed fuck it up to mess it up for the talent show. We told Henry about the song, and he not only approved but he also provided us with Henrys Barbershop t-shirts (I still have mine, but its as thin as tissue paper now).   So after practicing the medley ad infinitum, we felt we were ready for the talent show. Unfortunately, entry into the talent show required an audition. Also auditioning for the show was our rival band, a rather clich heavy metal outfit named Joker. Its not really accurate to call them rivals, however, since they occasionally got gigs.   Joker totally played into the hands of the meat-and-potatoes military crowd. Their audition song was Were an American Band. After sitting through a rather odd assortment of perfomers (including a middle-aged Filipino gentleman in a red nylon track suit singing Mr. Lonely by Bobby Vinton), our turn was up. I remember while we were testing sound levels with a brief snippet of Here Comes Your Man, I began thinking that maybe that was the song we should be auditioning with. Fuck it. Its now or never. The medley it is.   It went off fairly well, I think (except for the fact that Jamie had to borrow Jokers microphone stand, which was festooned with Steven Tyler-style bandanas), and by the general reaction of the bystanders in the theater, it sounded okay. But it was not to be. We didnt pass the audition.  I dont think you heard me. We didnt even pass an audition for a lousy military base talent show. Translation: we sucked.   Thus, Porkchop went out with a whimper, but there never really was much of a band to begin with. Jamie and Debbie now live in Connecticut with their ever-growing family and we see each other occasionally. Last October we met up, along with Terry and his girlfriend, for a rather drunken afternoon/evening in Boston. I havent the slightest idea what became of Wade or Gerard. But I would kill for a reunion. Maybe well get that medley down just right.

       the president's here, look busy   I will be unavailable for a sizable chunk of this afternoon. The president of our institute will be visiting with our department for a "strategic planning" meeting. Which means I will be sitting in a conference room, daydreaming endlessly. I'll try to come up with good ideas for blog posting during that time. Which means it won't really be a waste of time after all! Strategic planning, indeed.

       blogs, the front desk, and jerusalem   Im in the market for some fresh blogs to add to my links section (over there on the left. See them? There you go). Not that the blogs Ive linked so far are horrible or anythingtheyre all fine, trust me. But I really think that section could be beefed up a tad. If you know of any good blogs to recommend, pass them my way. Thanks.   Im trapped. And bored. I am currently assigned to the front desk of our office all afternoon, and since the phone must be answered and potential visitors must be properly directed, this desk cannot be unmanned during any part of the work day. If I need to pee or something, I have to call for back-up. I usually dont spend too much time up here, but the school year is winding down and the work-study students who are normally at this desk are going away for the summer. We have two work-studies who will be here full-time in the summer, but that arrangement doesnt start until next week. In the meantime, here I am. Bored. Nothing to do.   What I  can  do is tell you about the Steve Earle CD,  urlLink "Jerusalem."  One of my Borders co-workers, Bob, lent it to me this week and I really like it a lot. The album generated huge swaths of controversy when it was released last year, due to a song called John Walkers Blues, inspired by everyones favorite young-suburbanite-turned-Al-Qaedaist, John Walker Lindh. The song tells the story from Walkers perspective, not offering an opinion either way. Just observing. But of course this offends Joe Six-Pack, who prefers the sounds of Toby 10-10-220 Keith shaking his jingoistic fist at the world. Oh, brother. Xenophobia is sooo boring.   Anyway, controversy aside, its an excellent album, and once again, Steve Earle shows the world that if youve been shunned by the mainstream country music community, you must be doing something right. Ask  urlLink Lyle Lovett  or  urlLink k.d. lang.

       adventures in music retail, part three   Anyone out there work in retail? Really? Me too. If you ever have to spend any time whatsoever behind a cash register, I'm sure you've run into this situation: you're scanning an item and it doesn't seem to be going through. So the customer will say something clever like, "It must be free! Huh huh huh huh..."   Usually, I'll smile and give a polite chuckle, when what I really want to do is strangle the customer and scream, "I HEAR THAT EVERY FUCKING DAY AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY FUNNIER! SHUT UP!"  I talked to my co-worker Brian about this last week and we came up with a nice solution. The next time someone makes an unoriginal, unfunny comment about the scanner not working, we're going to pause for a second, as if we're taking in the joke, then, once we "get it," laugh maniacally for a full minute. I think that'll shut them up.

       once had a love, and it was a gas   Liza and I were all set to be boring tonight, getting a couple of sandwiches from  urlLink Il Panino Express  in the North End and heading over to her place to watch  urlLink "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit."  But I found out that  urlLink Blondie  is performing a  urlLink free show  at City Hall Plaza tonight. Im not a huge fan of Blondie, but I definitely like their music and for cryin out loud, its free. Free concerts are a great idea that just dont materialize enough. If you see a guy at the show with short brown hair, black glasses, shorts and a dark blue  urlLink Paul Weller  t-shirt, that would be me. Say hello, why dont you.   Hey, if anyone wants to buy me the  urlLink "Homicide: Life on the Street"  DVD box set, feel free. Have a great weekend.

       adventures in music retail, again   (Last night at Borders)  Customer: I'm looking for that Santana album where he does a bunch of duets.  Me: Well, I think his last album..."Shaman," I think it's called...that has a few "guest appearances" on it (walks over to Santana section, going through the discs)  Customer: Is it a "duets" album?  Me: Well, not really, I mean it has a few "duets" on it, but...  Customer: No, this is a "duets" album I'm talking about...like that Sinatra one.   Me: Do you know the name of the album?  Customer: No.  Me: Do you know the name of any of the songs?  Customer: No.   Me: Do you know who he duets with?  Customer: No.  Me: Well...I don't know what to tell you. This has some duets on it, as does his previous album, "Supernatural."  Customer: (obviously disappointed at my lack of superhuman powers that would allow me to read his mind and extract this obscure and probably nonexistent CD out of thin air): Well, okay, I'll just look around.    Folks, those of us who work in book/music stores are not, contrary to opinion, clairvoyant. If you're looking for a book, it would help to have the name of the book or at least the author. Same goes for CDs. And don't tell us what the cover looks like...that doesn't really help. Thanks!

       sweet baby james   I'm not really a big fan of  urlLink James Taylor's  music, but I have to tell you...I really have a lot of respect for this guy. He's been doing the sensitive singer-songwriter thing for more than 30 years, despite trends that may dictate otherwise. He seems like a really nice guy. He's from Boston. And perhaps best of all, he's 55 years old and is totally embracing his baldness. No silly combover for this guy and --thank God --  no ridiculous ponytail. "I'm going bald," he seems to say, "deal with it." How refreshing.

       pre-interview jitters   This afternoon at 2:30 I am interviewing for an internal job position. In other words, another position in my office has become available and I would like it. So the interview will be a little different than normal in that the people I'll be talking to are people I see and work with every day. That will certainly help ease the tension, but I'm still nervous. Any good vibes that can be sent my way will be most appreciated.   This being an interview day, I'm wearing a suit. Of course, the only suit I own is black, and Boston has just begun a brutal heatwave. How nice. I've decided on a light blue shirt and a brand new dark blue tie from  urlLink The Republic.  I'm also wearing my expensive  urlLink loafers  from an expensive gift certificate my mom got me for Christmas. Does that whole combo spell out "hire me?" Gee, I hope so.

       lizas big day (the weekend edition)   So yeah, the weekend. Saturday was Lizas birthday, so she and I did some nice little things, nothing fancy, but still nice. Friday evening we had ourselves a little picnic in the park on Summit Avenue in Brighton. I bought some food at  urlLink Whole Foods Market  (the snooty market formerly known as Bread & Circus), made sandwiches, got the side dishes together, poured a bottle of wine into a plastic container just in case the park enforces some sort of medieval rule about bottles (this is Massachusetts, after all), and there you go. You have to understand that I am not the kind of person who does stuff like this. Im normally far too selfish and lacking in romantic imaginationperhaps theres hope for me yet.   Saturday we both woke up early, me for my normal 8-11:30 shift at  urlLink Borders,  she because she was asked to come in and work a few hours. The first order of business was to purchase Lizas copy of the new  urlLink Harry Potter book  (yeah, shes a fanyou got a problem with that?). The night before, the store did something unprecedented  stayed open past midnight to sell a brand new product. It went well  we apparently sold 308 in the first hour  and the store was steadily busy throughout the weekend. By Sunday night, Liza has already read more than 200 pages.   My attitude towards the Harry Potter phenomenon is strangely mainstream (for me). Its easy for me to get all jaded and indie about it, you know  like the snooty types who claim that its a hip bandwagon that so-called literary wannabes are jumping on. But the truth is Im happy that its getting kids to read. Forgive me for getting all old man on you here, but when I was a kid, I was a huge reader. It was mostly Hardy Boys and Judy Blume, but hey  I was reading. Playstations and the Internet have replaced the common book in kids lives and its a crying shame. So Im all for Miss Rowling foisting these tales on us every couple of years. My only hope is that kids will not develop tunnel-vision and avoid non-Potter books. The series is a great starting point  now lets see kids explore even more.   After work on Saturday, I took Liza clothes shopping. We ended up at the  urlLink Gap,  where I was greeted by the sound system playing this amazing version of Sunshine Of Your Love. A female singer, some sort of brass-spiked Motown-meets-Shirley Bassey version. It was incredible. A search through allmusic.com this morning proved useless. If anyone knows which version this might be, let me know. Rarely have I been excited about any music played in the Gap. Go figure.    A couple days earlier, Liza let a bunch of co-workers know that they were all invited to  urlLink King's  for a little birthday to-do. Nothing formal, just some impromptu drinkin and bowlin. Apparently it wasnt enough notice because turnout was pretty low  maybe eight people total. But we had fun. The two-and-a-half hour wait for a bowling lane made bowling pretty much impossible, but we drank plenty and commandeered a Ms. Pac-Man machine in the clubs corner (note: there are few things in life more fun than watching Liza play Ms. Pac-Man). The evening ended with a buzzed visit to  urlLink Redneck's  in Allston (is there any other kind of Rednecks visit?) and a viewing of  urlLink "The Big Lebowski"  at Lizas place while scarfing down those nasty Rednecks egg sandwiches. Liza and I were both out like a light by the time The Dude met Maude.   I discovered Kings last month when my brother Gary came to visit. Its a really nice place, a sort of retro-loungey bowling alley / pool hall / bar. The drinks are a tad pricey, but I was really impressed by the lack of meat-market features, not to mention the almost total absence of hootchie-mamas. Kings. Across from the Back Bay Sheraton. You should try it.   Sunday was spent nursing mild hangovers and braving the pouring rain to the convenience store to get sugar (for Lizas coffee) and Gatorade (for aforementioned hangovers). We then headed over to my place where Liza continued plowing through the Harry Potter book and I put on my DVD of  urlLink "Rosemary's Baby."  Ive seen this film umpteen times, but I just bought the DVD a couple of weeks ago. Its really a terrific film. Roman Polanski is still one of my all-time favorite directors and the film has an uncanny ability to scare the hell out of me with a bare minimum of horror film standbys. Its very creepy in its un-creepiness. The extra features of the DVD are pretty decent. Theres a nice documentary made a couple of years ago that features interviews with Polanski, producer Robert Evans (speaking of creepy), and production designer Dick Sylbert. Theres also a making-of featurette that was produced back in 1968. The problem with featurettes from the 60s and 70s is that they always seem so hopelessly tacky and dated. This one has some priceless behind-the-scenes footage, but the whole thing really makes Mia Farrow out to be an annoying, flaky space case.   I almost forgot! Last week I picked up an excellent  urlLink Paul Weller  DVD that had been out for a few months but I didnt even realize existed. Its called  urlLink Two Classic Performances  and features a full outdoor concert from last summer as well as an extended acoustic performance from Later With Jools Holland. Very good stuff. If youre a fan, you should get this. If not, get it anyway. Youll be a fan by the time the end credits roll.

       a likely excuse   I got my latest cable bill in the mail last Friday. This morning, I opened it, since I plan on paying it this week. I notice that it's twice the amount it usually is. "That's okay," I say to myself. "That just means they haven't received my last check yet." After examining my checkbook register, I realize that the reason they didn't get my check is because  I never sent them one!  I can't believe it. What a bonehead. I actually forgot to pay my cable bill. This is the kind of thing stoners do. And I did it completely sober.

       adventures in music retail (last night)   A forty-something Asian woman, speaking very little english, approaches me at the music information desk and holds up a  urlLink Jay-Z  cd.   Her: What kind of music is this? Me: It's rap. Her: Rap? Me: Yes. Her (pointing to Jay's picture on the cover): He's a singer? Me: Um...yes.  Her (cheerfully): Okay!  I have no idea what her reaction will be once she hears it.

       caveat emptor   Remember the good old days, when you would go to your local record store, buy something that you weren't 100 percent sure about, then you take it home, listen to it, and decide that it's not really that hot after all? Okay, that may not exactly sound like an ideal "good old days" situation, but it illustrates quite nicely what I like to think of as the "excitement of unpredictable music purchases." (I just made that up two seconds ago -- it's not like some term that I've been throwing around for years or anything). If I see something in a record store that looks interesting enough to buy, and I have the money to spend on it, I'll probably buy it. If I don't like it, hey -- tough shit. Caveat emptor... buyer beware. In the words of Bruce Cockburn: you pay your money and you take your chance.   Try telling that to today's music consumer. I work part-time in the music/video department of  urlLink Borders.   Unlike most stores, we don't have those fancy computers that allow you to scan a CD's barcode and listen to song samples. We used to have a "Listen on Demand" set-up where a customer would be able to give us up to two CDs, have us open the discs, put it them in a listening station and let them go nuts with those two CDs for up to ten minutes. This was designed to give the customer the opportunity to hear CDs that they are considering purchasing. If they decide not to purchase them, we re-shrinkwrap them and put them back on the shelf. But we had to do away with this service when it was getting some serious abuse. In other words, people would have us open discs just so they could listen to them, with no intention of buying them (incidentally, this feature was a big hit with our drunk customers).  "Listen on Demand" may be dead and gone, but we still have listening stations scattered about the music department (filled with pre-selected titles). Assuming that all listening stations are working properly (which is rarely the case, I'll admit), that amounts to more than 500 titles to peruse at your leisure. But we still, quite often, get the petulant customer who strolls up to the desk, asking if there's any way that the disc they're holding can be opened and listened to.   In this case, I will first check our list of listening station titles to see if that disc is available to listen to. If not, I explain to them that we are not allowed to open the product.   Usually they're okay with that, but sometimes we'll get a ticked off customer who will ask, "if I don't like it, can I return it?"  At which point I will respond, as politely as possible, by saying, "You can only return an opened CD or DVD if it is defective, in which case it can only be exchanged for the same thing."  The customer, in all likelihood, will then become enraged, sputtering, "but...but...what if I don't *like* it??"  If you don't like it, hey...you made an error in judgment on that particular selection. C'est la vie. One of the joys of music purchases is taking chances. Sometimes you'll buy something that turns out to be not so hot. Perhaps you were enticed by the snazzy cover art. Maybe a friend who has spotty tastes in music recommended it. Whatever.   Two things to keep in mind: first of all, you can preview practically anything on the internet first. Second of all, it's quite possible that the disc may grow on you over time. Believe me, I own nearly 1,000 CDs and there are several of them that took me years to appreciate. But if it turns out you can't stand the thing and are convinced that you never will be able to listen to it again, take it to a used store. Particularly  urlLink CD Spins ...they'll take anything.   (This post was inspired by  urlLink April,  who recently experienced her own little retail hell the other day. Check it out.)_

       got the time?   If you missed his recent U.S. tour last spring, you have another chance to see Joe Jackson in  urlLink August.  That's right, he's coming back. If you're a Joe Jackson fan, you should drop everything, sell any unwanted possessions and get your tickets today (they go on sale at 4 p.m.). I saw him here in Boston on April 5 and was totally blown away (see my review posted here on April 7). Lots of old material, some great new stuff (from his brilliant new album,  urlLink "Volume 4" ) and some excellent covers as well. You should go.

       over the line, smokey!   It's my considered opinion that the  urlLink Coen Brothers  are among the greatest filmmakers alive today, and their 1998 film  urlLink "The Big Lebowski"  is probably the funniest (and most quotable) movie I've ever seen (the first time I saw it I had to pause the movie twice because I was laughing so hard). If you're a fan of this film and happen to be in the Louisville, Kentucky area on July 19th, how about checking out the annual  urlLink Lebowski Fest?  Unlimited bowling, White Russians, and no fucking Eagles. Mark it, dude.

       a case for fishbone   Sony Music has been busy the last couple of years, releasing  urlLink "Essentials"  compilation discs, which span a wide range of artists on their roster. Some of these releases are worthwhile (Bob Dylan, the Clash, Willie Nelson), while some seem baffling to me (is there such thing as essential Journey? Or Kenny Loggins? Were told on the website that an Essential Eddie Money is in the worksooh, pinch me!). Either way, these compilations are a nice way to be introduced to the artists work.  If you really want to give your money wisely to the folks at Sony, plunk down $11.99 for the  urlLink Essential Fishbone , one of the latest in the series.  urlLink Fishbone  is a band you may have heard before, but if you have a passing interest in their music and would love to get a big hunk of their best songs on one disc, this is the one to get. 16 tracks and barely any filler.   My love of Fishbone goes back a long way (a Mighty Long Way, to quote one of their songs). As a senior in high school, I sat next to a guy named Robert Owens in Mr. Boytes English class. I was not hugely popular in high school, but I gained some points with the students in this particular class because I did a dead-on impersonation of Mr. Boyte. Eventually I befriended Robert and it turned out that we had some similar tastes in music. He asked me at one point if I had heard of Fishbone and I said yes, but admitted that I hadnt heard a note of their music. He lent me a cassette of their second album, In Your Face. The production was a bit slick (they were most likely vying for radio airplay), but the songs were terrific, especially A Selection, (a rapid-fire ska number that I played over and over) Cholly, (a hilarious reggae tribute to full-figured women) and Simon Says the Kingpin (a perfect marriage of funk and punk).   The music combined ska, punk, funk and soul, completely manic and designed with one thing in mind  to get you off your ass. Lead singer/sax player Angelo Moore, keyboard player Chris Dowd, trumpet player Dirty Walt Kibby, bass player extraordinaire Norwood Fisher, drummer Fish and guitarist Kendall Jones were all accomplished musicians, songwriters and a bit of an anomaly in the music business  an African-American band who embraced punk rock (and complicated matters further by acknowledging more diverse artists like Frank Zappa and Rush as influences). But they were, make no mistake, completely funky in every way.   I eventually bought their self-titled debut EP (which contains Party at Ground Zero, one of my all-time favorite songs by anyone), the masterpiece Truth and Soul, and the dense, experimental The Reality of My Surroundings. I bought the soundtrack to Say Anything simply because it contained the unreleased Fishbone track Skankin to the Beat (John Cusack is apparently a Fishbone fanatic  he wore one of their t-shirts in the film, he hired them to play a bar band in his little-seen gem Tapeheads and he originally wanted their song Party at Ground Zero to be used as the song that Lloyd Dobler plays on the boombox in Say Anything, before less adventurous types decided that Peter Gabriels weepy In Your Eyes would be a better choice).  My brother and I saw them in concert in 1991 in a tiny venue in Orlando called the Beecham Theatre, where they proceeded to rip our collective senses to shreds  still one of the best concerts Ive ever attended.   Then, around 1993, something strange happened. They released the difficult, uncharacteristic Give a Monkey a Brain and Hell Swear Hes the Center of the Universe. Apart from a few funky, Fishbone-esque numbers (Unyielding Conditioning, Lemon Meringue), the album was generally light on the horns, harder on the guitars, and determined to be more Soundgarden and less Sly and the Family Stone. The album angered me. These guys were apparently cashing in on the then-enormous grunge movement and leaving their roots behind. It was, for me, the ultimate sellout.  Ive since revisited Give a Monkey and found recently that its actually quite an accomplished piece of music, but ten years ago it threw me for a loop and, quite frankly, the band hasnt been the same since. Theyve undergone a number of personnel changes and released some adequate-to-mediocre albums (Chim-Chims Bad-Ass Revenge, Psychotic Friends Nuttwerx), but Im told they still kick ass in concert. Oh well.   Its hard to pin down exactly what went wrong with Fishbone. A talented African-American artist who doesnt stay within the traditional parameters of jazz and R&B is usually doomed (just ask Living Colour or Terence Trent DArby), so that may have a lot to do with it. Perhaps Fishbone realized that their addictive blend of music wasnt selling enough, but then the grunge idea alienated what fan base they already had. Who knows?  What really does matter is that some of their best music is gathered on this one amazing compilation. Their 1985-1991 heyday is brilliantly chronicled with little to no fat. They even culled the best tracks from Give a Monkey If you want to relive a terrific band at the top of their game, buy this immediately. And play it loud.

       the mix that time forgot   Over the weekend, I rediscovered a mix disc that I made about four years ago. Its called Thirteen Crown and the song list can be found  urlLink here.  I acquired my very own PC in early 1999 and made mixes virtually non-stop until early 2002, when I decided to let my computer live at Lizas apartment since she, as a student, needs it a lot more than I do. I honestly dont miss it that much, except for the fact that I cant make mix discs anymore. Well, I can do that at Lizas place, but the PC is so old and slow that the time I should be spending with her ends up being time spent yelling at a computer. Not good for the relationship.   So anyway, I dug out this particular mix and once I started listening to it, I instantly remembered why I liked it so much. Even though it was made during a rather unpleasant, scary, depressing time in my life (summer 1999 -- lots of financial/job/relationship issues), the songs are almost all great. There was a theme to it  theyre all songs culled from the CDs of CMJ Music Magazine, which I bought religiously for about two years in the late 90s. A lot of the songs are from bands who I never heard another song from again, and who seemed to either fade into obscurity or never really took off at all (Karas Flowers, Jonathan Fire*Eater, Getaway Cruiser, Hepcat). And for the life of me, I dont know why on earth Drinking in L.A. by Bran Van 3000 didnt become some sort of party anthem of the late 90s. The song just makes me feel like getting drunk and doing some sort of sloppy drunk dance in a crowded apartment party.   What else...Garbarges cover of Big Stars Thirteen is luscious and beautiful and makes me realize how incredibly cool Shirley Manson can be; Death Car by Bostons own Wheat is mixes catchiness and loneliness just perfectly; Captain of the Teenagers by Nelson Hubbard is one giant hook, sounding like Weezer with less guitars and more keyboards; Hand In Your Head by Money Mark sounds like Nick Lowe with an extra large helping of funk. And thats just off the top of my head.   There are a couple of songs I regret including on this mix. As much as I love Shinehead, I have to admit that his cover of Stings Englishman in New York (renamed Jamaican in New York) doesnt really age well. I always seem to skip over the Connells song as well, probably because I was never really crazy about the Connells in the first place.   Hey, if you want a copy of this thing, drop me a line and maybe we could negotiate a trade. I'm all about spreading the love.

       why friday?   We all know that Friday the 13th is considered to be an "unlucky day." But why is that? I understand the concept that 13 is an unlucky number, but why Friday? It seems to me that Friday is a pretty nice day of the week. You know, the weekend's almost here and all that. Why not Monday the 13th? It's universally accepted that Mondays suck. Why ruin the Friday vibe by making it an unlucky day every few months? Just wondering.

       mom's in town   My mother is visiting from Maryland. My sister Karen is on her way to Amsterdam for a week with her boyfriend, so Mom is watching Karen's 10-year-old son Mike. Julie (the other sister) and I are going to visit Mom and Mike tonight (they're up in lovely  urlLink Derry, New Hamsphire ). Other fun family stuff: tomorrow night there's going to be a big get-together in celebration of my cousin Ryan's high school graduation. Boston accents and Italian food aplenty.    hey there, clothes-horse   My bills for the week are paid, and guess what? This dude's sittin' on some extra cash. How nice. Since I'm interviewing for an internal position within my office (I can talk about it online, it's really no secret), I've been doing my best to wear ties everyday to work in order to impress my potential future bosses. So far I think it's working (hopefully they'll be impressed by my actual job skills as well), so I've decided to forgo CD or DVD purchases this weekend (for a change), and make a trek out to  urlLink Banana Republic  for a new shirt, maybe a new tie, and perhaps even a new pair of pants. My work attire's really gotten better since I discovered "The Republic" a little over a year ago (tip: if you're straight, you need to be accompanied by a gay man if it's your first visit. I would have been completely lost if not for my dear friend Billy).    I bought a really nice tie last night at  urlLink Filene's  but am disappointed that nobody's said anything to me about it today. Maybe I'm the only one who likes it and everyone else is repulsed by it but too nice to say anything. Oh no! Could that be true? Probably not.

       banned?   I realized recently that I don't know a lot of Boston blogs, so I set about to change that, and several Google searches later, I was hooked up to a nice little site called  urlLink bostonites,  which is basically a webring for Boston-area bloggers. I'm certainly not trying to get corraled into a dating service, I just thought that reading local blogs would be fun in a gee-that-was-a-dead-on-regional-observation kinda way. And it is. I've found (and linked) several nice local blogs today. But now, for some reason, when I try to click on the list of all blogs on the site, this comes up:  ______________________________________________  No Authorization or Banned   You are seeing this page for one of two reasons:   1) You have tried to access an area of this site that you are not authorized to have access to.   or more likely   2) You have been banned from the site for using an unauthorized web spider. We do not allow web spiders to be used on our CGI scripts as is detailed in our robots.txt file. The ban will be in effect until 12:00am (EST) at which time the ban will be lifted. Be warned however that attempting to use a spider again will just result in you being banned once again.   _________________________________________________   Huh? What the hell did I do? And what, pray tell, is an "unauthorized web spider?" I'm not some pimple-faced hacker trying to tap into NORAD here. Will someone with a bit more web experience than I please explain this to me?

       street date jocularity   Tuesday is street day. All new music and video comes out on Tuesdays. This makes Tuesdays at my  urlLink part-time job  pretty interesting, especially since we get to see what sells and what languishes on the shelf, unnoticed and unloved. For some crazy reason, we completely sold out all 50 or so copies of  urlLink "Old School"  on the very first day (by about 3 p.m.). Can someone please explain this to me? I realize that there are people out there who laugh their asses off at films starring SNL alum, but to sell out of this tripe a mere eight hours after it arrives on the shelf is just plain sad. I understand that a majority of the public has horrible taste in films (I have scientific proof), but come on people. Will Ferrell? He was funny on Saturday Night Live, but that's really where it ends for me. I had people coming up to me about every two minutes or so (literally), asking me where "Old School" was. "Sorry, we're sold out." "Sorry, we're sold out." "Sorry, we're sold out." I tried to bring an air of class to the sales floor by occasionally adding, "we're also sold out of  urlLink "Once Upon a Time in America,"  but that was only met with confusion and apathy. Apparently Robert DeNiro and Sergio Leone are no match for a streaking Will Ferrell.   Dave H., one of the music supervisors (who has an encyclopedic knowledge of music -- I can talk to him for hours), commented that there are three new releases this week that include covers of "What A Wonderful World" -- Sarah Brightman, B.B. King and Kenny G (ewwww). A co-worker named Mark asked if it was on the new  urlLink Radiohead  as well. I thought this was pretty funny, but not nearly as funny as what happened next, which was Mark doing an impersonation of  urlLink Thom Yorke  singing the Louie Armstrong classic. I can't really explain it to you, suffice it to say that I was laughing pretty hard.   Also, the new  urlLink Steely Dan  album, "Everything Must Go," was released yesterday. We received a promo for in-store play, but it's a total joke. Not only is it just a five-song sampler, it's a "Borders Exclusive" promo that has an announcer breaking in every thirty seconds with a line like "The new Steely Dan, 'Everything Must Go,' is available at Borders on June 10th." Well there's a promo nobody's going to be taking home with them. Perhaps there's a Borders employee who enjoys skeet-shooting. The disc would come in handy then.

       wallet, shmallet   So far, the wallet boycott has been going strong for about three days. As I mentioned last Friday, Ive decided to do away with my wallet. Its a hassle. I dont like it. All I need from it is my bank card, my subway pass, my ID and my cash. Thats it! Apart from reaching for my wallet every twenty minutes (which Im sure will go away eventually), its been great. I feel free!   preferred by who?   There are two types of people in the world: those who love  urlLink Cheez-Its,  and those who love  urlLink Cheese Nips.  Im the former. For the life of me, I cant understand the appeal of Cheese Nips. They always taste stale to me. And the Nips people are being even more ridiculous by trumpeting Preferred Over Cheez-Its! on their boxes. Who are they surveying, people with no taste buds?   theyre shouting lou, not boo   If you read last Fridays post, youd know that my sister Julie and I got free tickets to see  urlLink Lou Reed's  Saturday night show at the  urlLink Orpheum.  Bearing in mind that the tickets were, once again, FREE, we had no room to complain about anything and we really didnt. Even when we found our seats, which were in the upper balcony, row Y (thats one row from Z, if you get my drift). Actually, sitting in the nosebleed section was kind of nice. Our particular section was almost empty, so we were able to put our feet up on the seats in front of us and really relax. It was honestly one of the most relaxing shows Ive ever attended. Julie brought her opera glasses, which we took turns using. Before the show, we talked about shows wed seen here and she told me the always-entertaining story about when she saw the  urlLink B-52's  there and the crowd was jumping up and down so hard that the ancient theaters balcony started shaking. Im not exactly an expert on Lous music, but Ive heard quite a bit of it, mostly the stuff everyone else knows, and overall Id have to say that the show was quite enjoyable. The instrumentation was unique, and made for some interesting arrangements: he had a guitarist/keyboard player, a cellist, a bass player and a back-up singer. No drummer, but the bass player (longtime Reed sideman Fernando Saunders) played a small electric kit on two songs. The cello was a wonderful idea, and the songs had a strange, haunting quality (which I suppose had a lot to do with Lous haunting songwriting style as well). The back-up singer (named simply Antony) was an odd one. He looked a lot like  urlLink Frank Black,  but wore make-up and he did lots of Joe Cocker-style mannerisms. The song selection was interesting. I didnt want to get all Top 40 and complain that he didnt play Walk on the Wild Side, but I noticed some of the hard-core fans after the show being a little confused by that omission as well.  He opened with the amazing Sweet Jane (he played a  lot  of  urlLink Velvet Underground  stuff). Huh. Maybe I  do  know a lot about this guy after all.

       lou reed, keeping cool and the wallet boycott   One of the things Iike to do when I'm bored at work and need a laugh is check out  urlLink this great unofficial Seinfeld website.  The site contains, among other things, the full scripts of every single episode. Even if I've seen the episode before (and I've seen most of them), reading them can still make me giggle like a mental patient. I happen to think that Seinfeld is perhaps the best-written TV comedy show ever (after the initial first couple of seasons, which were a bit spotty), and without a doubt the greatest sitcom known to man -- it gave that tired genre a swift kick in the ass that has yet to be topped. And oh, don't bother telling me that there's some hipper-than-thou HBO show that's ten times funnier. You're probably right, but I don't get HBO, so let me enjoy my "basic cable" opinions, okay? Thanks.  Anyway, I was reading the script for "The Reverse Peephole," and one of the subplots involved Jerry getting rid of his wallet (at Kramer's insistence, who assured Jerry that they "went out with powdered wigs"). I find wallets a necessary evil, but I also hate the fact that this big hunk of vaguely cow-ish material is hanging onto my ass at my every pants-wearing moment. It's uncomfortable and also creates a small rectangular outline on my back pockets that, after a while, make my nice "office pants" look like crap (and reminds me a bit of the rednecks I would see when I lived in Florida and how they had outlines of chewing tobacco cans branded onto their back pockets). All I need a wallet for, honestly, is my money, my bank card, and an ID. That can all fit in my front pocket -- I think. That will be my experiment for the weekend. To go wallet-free. Thanks, Kramer.   Other weekend plans involve something that just came up this morning -- my sister Julie was given two free tickets to  urlLink Lou Reed's  Saturday night concert at the Orpheum. I'm not really a huge fan -- I can appreciate his place in rock music history, and what I've heard of him is usually pretty good, but I don't think I would pay 40 or 50 bucks to see him live. Which is why Julie and I are seeing him for nothing. Yay!  Sunday Julie is taking me to  urlLink Yale Electric  where I'm going to finally break down and buy an air conditioner. Last summer's heatwave convinced me of this. My roommate Frank has two of them -- one in his bedroom and one in the dining room, which is right across the hall from my bedroom. The dining room one works okay for cooling my room, as long as the door is open. Well, Yale is selling their basic a/c for a pretty darn good price, so I'm going to get one, close my bedroom door, and let the freezing, artificially-cooled air work its magic.

       the friday five   There's a rather popular website out there called  urlLink the friday five,  which urges readers (and bloggers) to fill out the five-part questionnaire (updated every Friday, I guess) and, if you blog, post the answers. I've checked it out on occasion, but always felt that the questions had a ridiculous, junior-high-school feel to them. This week's is especially wretched, but I checked out the one from a year ago, and it seems okay. Since it's Friday and I'm vaguely bored, here you go:  1. Where are you right now? At my desk, at work.  2. What have you lost recently? I lost my umbrella yesterday, but that doesn't really count, since I lose them all the time. Last week I lost my subway pass, which wasn't too big of a deal since it's a monthly pass and I lost it on the 30th. It could have been a lot worse. And of course, yesterday I lost my patience with my office scanner. Ha ha.   3. What was the first CD you ever purchased? Does that embarrass you now? In 1986 (at age 17), I saved up enough money from my part-time job to get a portable CD player. CD players in general were not nearly as commonplace as they are now, and this one cost something like $225. And it had no shock protection. Big, bulky, piece of crap. But it was a CD player and nobody else I knew owned one. Then I  bought a batch of CDs, some of which I'm still proud of, a few that are not so great. "Parade" by Prince (still great, in my opinion), "Time Pieces" by Eric Clapton (before I realized that 99 percent of what EC has done as a solo artist blows chunks), "Empire Burlesque" by Bob Dylan (easily my least-favorite Dylan album) and "Stop Making Sense" by Talking Heads (a great album and a great movie, but since rendered obselete by the deluxe edition, released in 1999). About a year later, the CD player bit the dust, and instead of getting it fixed, I gave my discs to a friend and didn't buy another one for about two more years. That's a really long answer to a short question.   4. What is your favorite kind of writing pen? What a strange question. I'm not really a "pen fetishist." I love Sharpies, though.  5. What is your favorite ice cream flavor? I go through phases. Right now I'm torn between Ben & Jerry's Brownie Batter and Breyer's Reeses Peanut Butter. There's a couple of Ben & Jerry's flavors that I never see anymore but would love to find them if they're still around: Apple Crumble and Ooey Gooey Cake. In a pinch, however, Coffee is always a good flavor.    Here's to do-nothing Fridays.

       fell in love with a couch    urlLink Glenn Gould  -- who is best known as a classical pianist, but has worked extensively as a producer of radio documentaries -- once said that in the course of preparing radio documentaries, he's interviewed a theologian about technology, a surveyor about William James, an economist about pacifism and a housewife about acquisitiveness in the art market. "It's been far more instructive," he explains, "to talk with Pablo Casals, for example, about the concept of the zeitgeist, which, of course, is not unrelated to music.... Or to Leopold Stokowski about the prospect for interplanetary travel, which is  I think you'll agree, and Stanley Kubrick notwithstanding  a bit of a digression."  Bearing that in mind,  urlLink here's  an amusing interview with Jack White -- one half of the duo  urlLink White Stripes,  where he discusses...wait for it...upholstery.

       in a slump   I seem to be in a bit of a blogging slump lately. I hate to post anything if the inspiration doesn't hit me, and lately it just hasn't been hitting me. This week I've been in the mood to observe rather than create. So while I haven't been posting anything, I've been all over other weblogs  -- my usual favorites, like  urlLink this one,   urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one.  I've also been  discovering  some great blogs as well:  urlLink Rico  is one of my new faves. Reading other blogs usually inspires me to post stuff of my own, so stay tuned.   And speaking of enjoying blogs,  urlLink nitpicker  is back after a rather lengthy hiatus. This blog is the product of Terry Welch, an extremely intelligent and insightful friend of mine whom I've known for about ten years. Terry was also the guy who inspired me to get off my ass and create a blog of my own (yes, it's his fault). Check out his site -- in a world of Bill O'Reilly and  Fox "News," it's comforting to read the thoughts of an intelligent liberal.   If you're looking for something to watch tonight, check out tonight's 7 p.m.  urlLink Law & Order rerun on TNT.  They're airing a 1994 episode called "Censure," and the guy playing Dan Rudman is  urlLink Kip Niven,  who happens to be one of Liza's drama professors at  urlLink Emerson.  A brush with fame is one thing, but a Law & Order brush is something else entirely.

       hip-hop folkies in the rain (cha-cha-cha)   Whenever I'm not in one of those big pontificating essay-writing modes -- and it's Monday -- I feel an obligation to cop out and give you a report on my weekend.   So here it is...Friday, after work, I went home, changed my clothes and headed over to Boston University's  urlLink Tsai Performance Center,  where the Jeanette Neil Dance Studio presented one of their semi-annual dance shows. I never miss them. Why, do you ask? Well, 'cause I'm as queer as a three-dollar bill. No, actually, it's because Liza participates in it every year. She's in their hip-hop class (despite being a white girl from Minnesota, Liza is one hell of a...hip-hopper. Is that a word? Whatever...).   Can I go off on a tangent here? Sure, why not. For the life of me, I can't figure out why, as many  urlLink Dunkin' Donuts  as there are in New England (4.5 billion at last count), there's never one around when you get anunexpected hankering for their java. I'm on the T, headed for BU, when I realize that I'm going to be early (I'm meeting my sister Julie there at 7). A nice cup of French Vanilla would be perfect, I think. When I get off the train, I realize that there isn't one for at least five or six blocks and I just don't have that kind of time. So I go across the street to Campus Convenience (or "CampCo," as the kids call it) and get myself an  urlLink Orangina.  A far cry from a hot cup of coffee, but I'm always up for an Orangina.   Liza's show was terrific. As always, there were some slightly boring numbers, but most of them were great. One group totally jumped on the "Chicago" bandwagon and did a song from that movie/musical, and there was also a Tom Jones medley that made me smile. Liza's group, in all honesty, probably got the biggest reaction of the night. Not only did they do an extended hip-hop piece, but half the dance group (including Liza) ended the piece with a short tap-dancing number, which was really amazing. It may all sound completely dorky to the average person reading this, but they were really outstanding.   Saturday was more of the same Saturday stuff: Did my morning shift at Borders, which ended up being extended into mid-afternoon, since my boss (Nancy, the music manager) asked me if I'd stay to work on a "merch" project and what the hell, I could use the extra money. What I didn't realize at the time was that our A/C is on the fritz and while I got a lot accomplished, I probably lost a good five to ten pounds with all the sweating. Holy crap it was hot up there.   Saturday ended with a terrific night out with Julie at  urlLink Club Passim,  where we caught an amazing show by the one and only  urlLink John Wesley Harding.  I've been a huge JWH fan since around 1990, but had only seen him live once, and that was as an opening act. Wes was up there by himself with just an acoustic guitar and his amazing arsenal of songs, and boy was it fun. He's a bit of a folkie, but very British, and can probably best be described as a cross between  urlLink Elvis Costello  and  urlLink Billy Bragg.  He talks a lot between songs, and like Billy Bragg, is very, very funny (but not nearly as political as BB). He played piano on two songs and warned us all ahead of time that he has hardly ever played the piano in concert since he's not very good at it, but was advised to start doing so by his therapist. A violinist (or perhaps "fiddle player" is the best term in this case) joined him onstage for a few songs. Wes ended up playing several of my favorite songs..."Humble Bee," "I'm Wrong About Everything" (which you can find on the soundtrack to High Fidelity), "Into The Wind," "The Devil in Me" (the very first song I'd ever heard of his) and a whole bunch more. I noticed also for the very first time that he looks a tiny bit like Jerry Seinfeld, which is kind of strange. The only real downside to the entire show was this really, really, fucked up guy in the very back who hooted and hollered REALLY LOUDLY during the applause, and continued to clap really slowly for about 30 seconds after everyone had stopped. Wes handled him with real class, like all professional acts deal with hecklers, and eventually he was escorted out of the venue (after about the third song). After the show, Julie and I split up since she was meeting a friend for dinner (I was invited but was too tired). I headed to  urlLink Newbury Comics  since I didn't have anything to read or listen to on the train ride home. I snagged an overpriced British music magazine called "The Word" simply because it contained a huge interview with  urlLink Morrissey,  who still fascinates me after all these years. The article was hugely entertaining, although I was a bit disturbed to see that one of my high school heroes is starting to get really gray. Oh, and I also got a used copy of  urlLink "Summer Teeth"  in my ongoing pursuit of all things  urlLink Wilco.  So far I like it, although I prefer the more adventurous sounds of  urlLink "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"  and  urlLink "Being There."   A good deal of Sunday was spent at home while the rain was busy pissing off everyone who had to be outside. I did laundry, watched some bad television and vacuumed. Then I headed to Liza's house where I helped her clean her room, made some tortellini and watched a  urlLink Law & Order: Criminal Intent  rerun, followed by bits and pieces of  urlLink "A Time To Kill,"  which I'd seen several years ago but forgot how incredibly sappy it was. Liza pointed out that everybody in the movie sweats an awful lot, which is true. What's also true is that, although I think he's a good actor, the character played by  urlLink Oliver Platt  was such an annoying caricature I wanted to throw stuff at the TV every time he was on.  And with that abrupt, un-graceful ending, today's long-winded rant comes to a close. Forgive my stream-of-conscious nature -- I was reading  urlLink Dougie's blog  prior to starting this. Blame him, the little scamp.

       fun with toy cars: update   My photo made in onto the  urlLink parking spot website!  The last time I checked, it was the most recent entry, but if not, it's photo #200. I'm propping up the car with a letter opener, provided to me by my cubicle neighbor, Gisela. And while this endeavor was performed on company time (with a company camera), if you look closely, you'll see that the letter opener advertises the Jimmy Fund, the fundraising arm of the  urlLink Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,  which is where I work. So I was able to put in a little plug for the office.   Saturday night's  urlLink John Wesley Harding  show was fantastic. More about that later.

       does he come with extra parts?   As I type this, Sean Patrick O'Malley (think he's Irish?) is being "installed" as the new Archbishop of Boston. That's right. It's not an inauguration, it's an "installation." I couldn't resist pondering the reasons behind using that particular word. Come on, people. He's not a new kitchen appliance. We're not talking about a satellite dish here. It's a person, coming into a high position in the archdiocese of our city. Why are we describing him as if he comes with a set of instructions? Oh, wait. Maybe the ten commandments are the instructions. Ho, ho. Just a little religious humor, folks.

       that great british band nobody else knows about   Just a bit of good news (for me anyway) before I'm off for the weekend. Out of sheer boredom, I went to the official website of  urlLink The Beautiful South,  one of my favorite bands. I say "out of sheer boredom" because they never update the damn thing (until today it was still advertising their "brand new greatest hits album," which was released in November 2001). Anyway, the site has a new look, the band has a new female singer (replacing Jacqueline Abbott, who quit in 2000) and a new album called "Gaze" is scheduled for a November release. Life is good.

       white trash weekend (without me)   Liza is out of town for the weekend. As I type, shes on her way to Corinna, Maine. Just to give you some perspective, shell be closer to Canada than Boston. Corinna is where our mutual friend Louisa is from. Louisa actually lives in nearby Malden (she used to work at our Borders, now she works at the one in Cambridge), but her mom still lives up in the sticks. And trust me, Corinna is the sticks.   Whats going on up there this weekend? Why, its Louisas annual White Trash Weekend. In July 2000, a bunch of us drove up there, spent the weekend at Louisas moms very strange, ramshackle house (we actually camped outside), sat around drinking beer and made interminable comments regarding how much different the place is from Boston. There was about a half-dozen of us. We liked it so much, we did it the next year, where we even paid a visit to Spectrum, nearby Bangors only gay bar (where I was asked by another man if I wanted to dance, despite the fact that Liza was sitting on my lap at the time). It was a fine time, thoroughly relaxing and rural (especially the hammock, where I spent a good hour or two buried in my Stanley Kubrick biography).  Liza and I missed last years, but she was determined to go this time (theyre even having t-shirts made, Im told). Work conflicts and a family commitment are preventing me from joining her. My cousin Brendan turns 21 this week, and his parents (my Uncle Bobby and Aunt Linda) are holding a barbecue tomorrow in his honor.   What else is going on this weekend? Well, tonight Im having my groceries delivered. If you dont have a car or the desire to actually set foot in a supermarket (my particular issue is the former), may I suggest checking out  urlLink Peapod?  Go online, order your groceries and schedule the delivery time. Its all about convenience.   Have a great weekend.

       hes got a force field and a flexible plan   Im totally digging my copy of Rushs  urlLink Signals,  which I bought last Friday as part of my rediscovery of this band that guided me through my pre-teen years. The band took a little guff from their fans when the album was released in 1982, mainly due to the fact that the keyboards are taking a much bigger role than on previous albums, and consequentially Alex Lifesons guitar playing takes a bit of a back seat. I see this album as a natural progression from their two previous works, 1980s  urlLink "Permanent Waves"  and the mega-huge smash from 1981,  urlLink "Moving Pictures."    Permanent Waves saw Rush drummer/lyricist Neil Peart moving a bit away from the Dungeons & Dragons lyrical style (although the song Jacobs Ladder does in fact begin with the line whos come to slay the dragon?) and more into areas of science and technology. It may just be geek rock of a different flavor, but at least the new lyric subject matter is a bit more rooted in reality. Also, the band began phasing out the epic 10-minute-plus tracks, for the most part (Jacobs Ladder is a bit epic-y and the closer Natural Science is a long one, too  its even divided into little chapters,  urlLink Yes -style). Moving Pictures only contains one big long number, the underrated Camera Eye, and by this time the keyboards were definitely coming out of the woodwork.  Signals definitely has a heavy keyboard sound, but its not nearly as intrusive  or dated  as one might think. The keyboards provide a melodic base, and the killer bass, guitar, and drum chops of previous albums are still alive and well. The bands songwriting is as strong as ever here, with more of an emphasis on traditional melody and structure. This is the album, after all, that produced Rushs only bona fide top 40 pop hit (New World Man). By this point, Geddy Lees vocals were nicely reined in with a minimal amount of shrieking (my main complaint of their early stuff).   The band was definitely in the process of reinvention at this stage. The more down-to-earth lyrics are a breath of fresh air, with Peart's erudite pen handling such subjects as teenage suburbia (Subdivisions) and fear (The Weapon), while the music veered from reggae (Digital Man, New World Man) to pseudo-techno-dance (The Weapon almost sounds like Depeche Mode in parts) to a beautiful combination of frantic rock anddare I say itsoulfulness (The Analog Kid, one of the most diverse and consistently listenable tracks on the album).   I dont yet have the stomach to dig into the early, shrieking sounds of Rushs first few albums, nor am I terribly interested in their post-Signals stuff (yet). But for a perfect mixture of rock, prog, power-pop and just a hint of reggae, you cant beat the late 70s/early 80s incarnation of this band.

       that rug really tied the room together   As I mentioned on this site recently, the Second Annual Lebowski Fest took place July 19 in Louisville, Kentucky and was a sold-out smash (something like 800 attendees, compared to last year's 150). The official site has  urlLink pictures.  You have no idea how much I wish I could have been there.  Liza and I are going to the next one, no matter where it is. Believe it.

       a few things to ponder   For some strange reason, my electric razor stopped working. This morning, I turned it on and nothing happened. It's almost fully charged, too. It just died, after about 18 months. I hardly ever have manual razors and shaving cream on hand, but Sunday night I bought some because I had a couple days' growth and thought it would be easier that way. It turns out that my sudden urge to buy those things prevented me from looking like a bum at the office this morning. Go figure.   One of the stalls in our office men's room has been locked from the inside all day and there's nobody in there. I'm at a loss to explain how or why this happened. Did someone lock it from the inside and then shimmy out through the bottom? If so, why? Did someone escape down the toilet? Once again...if so, why?  Liza was one of a few lucky Borders employees who received a free pass to an advance screening of  urlLink "Seabiscuit"  last night. She said it was excellent. She also said that she cried about four times, which means that the average moviegoer will cry maybe once.

       how i spent my sunday   Sunday afternoon I headed over to the dance studio where I was to meet Liza. We were going to eat lunch and see a movie. As I approached the studio (right across the street from the Fleet Center), I noticed a line a mile long (or maybe a hundred years) of slutted-up, overly made-up and underdressed hoochie-mamas. They were all in a long line that led up to the building where Liza's dance class takes place. As I tried to decipher the meaning of this surreal sight, I noticed a sign by the entrance to the building that read "Coyote Tryouts."  As I made my way through the line (choking through the odor of too much perfume) and grabbed the elevator, I met Liza on the fifth floor where she explained to me that the second floor was the location of auditions for a new "Coyote Ugly" bar that's opening right down the street (next door to Boston's very own Hooters -- this is the classy part of town, as you can tell). I didn't know these bars existed. Apparently, the smashing success of the brain-cell destroying "Coyote Ugly" movie has spawned real-life bars where clothing- and intelligence-deprived bimbos dance on the bars. I don't know if they double as bartenders or not, but for me, all I want in a bartender is the ability to pour and serve a drink. Save the dance steps for someone who cares, okay?  Afterwards, Liza and I made our way across the street to  urlLink Hilton's Tent City,  where Liza got a brand new mega-huge travel backpack for her semester abroad. Let me just say that this place is simply astonishing. Four floors  packed  with merchandise, the friendliest, most easygoing (read: not pushy) staff you could ever meet, and prices  way  lower than those trendy REI stores. Hilton's Tent City. Check it out. Anyway, while I was in there, I noticed the ever-growing Coyote Ugly line forming across the street, with a curious addition. A male thirty-something truck-driver type with a red ball cap and a beer gut had joined thier ranks. I pointed that out to the Hilton's employee standing next to me and he told me that the he talked to the guy earlier while he was outside. Apparently Red Ball Cap "always wanted to be a bartender," so what the hell. I sure hope he didn't have to wait too long before he was told that "you're not what we're looking for."   After lunch, Liza and I went to see  urlLink "28 Days Later,"  which we both enjoyed muchly. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was directed by Danny Boyle, who did such a marvelous job with  urlLink "Trainspotting,"  and the reviews were pretty positive, so why not?. It was quite the creepy, intense (and extremely gory) affair. Shot almost entirely on digital video, it had a grainy, sometimes inpenetrable feel to it, which only made the film more intense. One of the early scenes consisted of the main character wandering around a deserted London, wondering what the hell he missed during his 28-day coma. Very effective. Excellent music score, too (very unconventional and highly entertaining).

       The mother of all guilty pleasures   In the summer of 1981, I was 12 years old, and at the time had been a serious rock music fan for about five years. The benefit of having older siblings playing their records around the house helped me appreciate music at an early age. My parents didnt really buy a whole lot of kids music for me, becausewell, I guess they figured Id constantly blow it off in favor of the heavy stuff. After all, who needs a Sesame Street record when you can have  urlLink Who's Next?   Most of the stuff I was listening to at the time was progressive rock. You know, all that nerdy stuff with the overbearing keyboards, long hair and capes, playing impossibly complicated music that will never get you chicks. I hadnt yet discovered punk rock, new wave, reggae, ska or even jazz. So it was business as usual that summer when my brother Gary brought home a box set called Archives.   Archives, you see, was a vinyl three-record set comprising the first three albums of the group  urlLink Rush   (you can check it out on  urlLink eBay ). I had heard of Rush briefly. I think my first exposure to them was a year or two before that, when I happened to notice some of their sheet music for sale at the music store where I took drum lessons (this was about a month before the arrival of MTV, so I had never even seen videos of them yet). Anyway, my brother began playing the records non-stop and we were both hooked.   The first, self-titled album, was a pretty raw, basic affair, with lead singer/bass player Geddy Lee shrieking away about love and the working man, guitarist Alex Lifeson cranking out Zeppelin-style boogie riffs and drummer John Rutsey pounding away, not realizing for a second that he would soon be the Pete Best of prog rock.   Their second album, Fly By Night, was a considerable step forward. Rutsey was out, and Neil Peart was in. Peart was not only a skilled drummer (if Keith Moon were sober and had a grasp of music theory, he might have sounded a bit like this), but a rather cogent lyricist as well.   The third record in the set, Caress of Steel, was along the same lines as its predecessor, but  in my opinion  a bit of a step back in the songwriting department. Whatever the case, these three records were undoubtedly the soundtrack of my 1981 summer. On the rare occasion that I happen to hear something from these albums, I automatically think of drinking lemonade in Nashua, New Hampshire. Its that simple.   Soon Gary and I were grabbing all the Rush albums we could find. Fortunately, there was a new album right around the corner: the ever-popular Moving Pictures, which contained some of their best known songs, Tom Sawyer and Limelight, to name a few. Gary then bought 2112 (which, for some time, was my hands-down favorite Rush album) and the live albums All the Worlds a Stage and ExitStage Left. In 1982, they released another commercial smash, Signals, notorious for its heavy accent on keyboards, as well as a bona fide pop top 40 hit (New World Man). There was even a cool video for the song Subdivisions. (Rush was actually in fairly heavy rotation on MTV in the early 80s, an unthinkable concept today).   At this point in my life, my love of music went beyond the mere emotional impact of the sounds. As a young pre- and early teen who not only played drums, but -- as a condition of my parents allowing me to play -- taking lessons, I enjoyed picking apart the intricacies of Pearts drumming and making lame attempts to ape his rudiments. It was hopeless, but fun. In 1982, I even entered a contest sponsored by  urlLink Modern Drummer magazine  to win Neil Pearts drum set. I had to write, in 100 words or less, an essay explaining why I wanted the set. (I didnt win.)   After Signals, my interest in Rush began to waver. I felt I got everything I could out of their music up to that point. For a while, the only post-Signals songs I heard from them were Distant Early Warning and The Big Money (thanks to the videos). For reasons still not clear to me this day, I went through a massive  urlLink Grateful Dead  phase from about 1983 to 1985, continued to obsess over  urlLink Genesis , and even went through an intense  urlLink Bob Dylan  discovery phase. Then of course, in 1985, I discovered  urlLink Elvis Costello.  Thats when it all changed.   Rush took a serious backseat to my musical tastes for many years. I took no notice of the albums they were cranking out through the remainder of the 80s and 90s and joined all my fellow pseudo-punks in ridiculing these old farts with their Ayn Rand obsessions and oversized drum sets.    In recent months, however, Ive realized that, at age 34 (or at any age, really), its ridiculous to shun or even hate a band simply because a) the music is too complicated or b) the cool kids dont like it. I began rediscovering some old prog stuff and even discovering bands I never listened to back then (like  urlLink King Crimson ). Several months ago, for the pure sake of nostalgia, I bought a used copy of Rushs Moving Pictures and was pleasantly surprised at how much of it I still appreciated. Prog tends to get a little cold and soulless, but a good deal of it is still fascinating to me.   Last night I picked up a copy of Rushs A Farewell to Kings (which I first bought used on vinyl in 1983 at  urlLink Headlines,  a record store/head shop in Nashua). While the lyrics (to me) dont seem to have aged very well, I was really enjoying the music, particularly the epic Xanadu. Rush may not be party music (unless its a Dungeons & Dragons party), but theres a lot of great stuff to dig into.     If you have skeletons in your closet, dont just let them out. Embrace them.

       out of the sinking   According to his  urlLink website,  Paul Weller will be releasing a b-sides/rarities compilation sometime this summer. It's called "Fly on the Wall" and will consist of three, count 'em,  three  discs. The first two are b-sides, remixes, etc, and the third disc will be a collection of covers Paul's recorded over the years (including songs by John Lennon, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Sonny & Cher(!) and others.   Thirty-nine tracks of rare Wellerness. Holy crap, this is gonna be good...

       hey! you there with nothing to do...   You should really check out  urlLink drumzspace's blog.  I read his stuff regularly, but his most recent post talks about, among other things, the curious current goings-on of Steve Burns, a.k.a. the dude from TV's "Blue's Clues," as well as some really on-target comments regarding the recent  urlLink tragedy  in Santa Monica.

       welcome to my umpteenth reality tv rant   David E. Kelley, one of television's most prolific writer/producer/creators, took the opportunity as a panel member of the Television Critics Association's summer press tour to do something I always admire in anyone: berate reality televison.   "There has been erosion in respect for the media by its guardians, and the proliferation of reality television is probably the best example," he said.   While in years past network executives championed quality scripted television, "today they celebrate the junk," he said. "Once, they were ashamed of it; now they throw parades for themselves."   Bravo, David.   I'm not a huge fan of "The Practice" or a lot of Kelley's other shows, but I really enjoy when someone takes a well-deserved swipe at those morons responsible for "Who Wants To Marry My Dad," "World's Ugliest Hoochie Mamas," "Help Pay for My Cousin's Hooker" or whatever reality show is foisted on the American public. Enough, already!  By the way, as far as my current mindset of trying to be more "positive" in my blog...this, in my opinion, is a positive post. Reality shows degrade the general population and reward both greed and shallow behavior. Criticizing reality television is extremely positive.

       depravity in classical music and korean war comedy   Its Tuesday, which, in the music and video retail business, is street day (Ive covered this before, but it makes for a somewhat coherent post, so indulge me). Today is the day of the week when virtually all CDs and DVDs for the week are released. I noticed that a ridiculous, supposedly hipper-than-thou term that gets around a lot is drop, as in the new P. Diddy disc drops on Tuesday. Personally, Id like to drop all of Diddys releases off the top of a tall building, but the point is, its a ridiculous term, so try not to use it around me, k? All righty.   Liza mentioned to me the other day that my blog has a tendency to get too negative. Perhaps I should try to be a little nicer. Sorry.   Where was I? Street date. Right. Not much of note coming out today, Im afraid. I work the closing shift at Borders on Mondays, so I help put out new releases after the store shuts its doors at 9 p.m. On the classical side, theres a brand new  urlLink disc  with a really cruel-looking cover, but I havent heard the music yet, so I cant really give you a yea or nay just now. Look at that cover  urlLink again,  will you? How evil. On a barely-related note, in my three years of manning the classical section of my store, Ive come across exactly one classical disc with a Parental Advisory sticker. Its called  urlLink The Art of the Bawdy Song.  The fact that there's a song on there called "My Man John Had a Thing That Was Long" might have something to do with it. Oh, that bawdy Renaissance era!  One thing Im kind of interested in that was released today is the  urlLink Complete Fourth Season of M*A*S*H.  I love  urlLink M*A*S*H , and for me, their "middle period" was my favorite. While I liked early characters like Henry Blake and Trapper John McIntyre, I felt that the first two seasons were too focused on slapstick and caricature. The third season (the last one with Blake and McIntyre) was pretty good, but I really liked it when Potter and Hunnicut came aboard. Pierce and Hunnicut had a great rapport, while I felt that the McIntyre character was too cynical and bullyish. The writing during this period was excellent. When Winchester joined, it was good for a season or two (his Beacon Hill snob brought a unique perspective to the cast), but the last three, maybe four seasons were horrible. It's not that the seriousness and preachiness got on my nerves (though it occasionally did); it was the lack of effort in the comedy writing. Any attempt to make the show funny during those last few seasons fell flat. I've often watched reruns from that era without cracking a smile once. Oh, and here's a tip on how to avoid anything from that period when tuning into M*A*S*H reruns: if Sergeant Rizzo (played by G.W. "Police Academy" Bailey) is in the episode, it's a stinker. Trust me.

       in time, you can turn these obsessions into careers   Saturday nights  urlLink  Elvis Costello  concert at the Fleet Pavilion was my third EC show, and for a lot of people, that would be more than enough. But like a lot of my favorite performers, Elvis is an eclectic sort, and every show so far has been different. In April 1987 I saw him perform a solo acoustic concert (as part of his 87 college tour) at the University of California at Irvine (it was during spring break of my senior year in high school and I was visiting a friend who lived in Los Angeles). I saw him again in June 1999 as the headlining act of the Guinness Fleadh Festival at Suffolk Downs, here in Boston (he was joined by his keyboard-playing partner-in-crime, the incomparable Steve Nieve). The show last Saturday was the first time Ive seen him perform with a full band, the Imposters (basically the Attractions with Davey Faragher replacing bass player Bruce Thomas), and I wasnt disappointed.    You could say that Elvis pulled a Van Morrison at the show  no chitchat, just the songs, often one after the other with no pauses. The uptempo triple-threat of Waiting For the End of the World, the rarely-played Beyond Belief and Radio Radio opened things up quite nicely. Our seats werent the best, but the Pavilion (a venue Id never attended before) had video screens presented on both sides of the stage, which seems cheesy when you hear it described, but is actually very convenient. Elvis dialed it down with the mid-tempo Sulky Girl, the merseybeat version of Everyday I Write the Book (which Ive heard him do as one of the bonus tracks of the Rykodisc version of Punch the Clock), and a cover of Mose Allisons bluesy Everybodys Crying Mercy --- which Elvis recorded for his covers project Kojak Variety and was probably included in the set for the line everybodys crying peace on earth / just as soon as we win this war.   One of the few disappointments of the night followed, with the excellent Clubland, one of my favorite EC songs. This sophisticated, intricately arranged song was ruined by a rather muddy sound (as nice a venue as the Pavilion is, the sound quality could be improved). Clown Strike, a song I was never too crazy about, seemed to sound better with the live vibe, and the pounding Complicated Shadows was a highlight, as was the classic Miracle Man.   After Just About Glad, (the third song from Brutal Youth, which is a bit much to pull from that particular album), Elvis launched into a brand new song, the beautiful ballad Either Side of the Same Town. The slower tempo continued with I Cant Stand Up For Falling Down, a Sam & Dave cover from Elvis Get Happy!! album. Actually, he sang the first verse slow, then launched into a fast version, but the truth is, Sam & Daves original recording was indeed a ballad. The noisy, fun Uncomplicated, a stretched-out, slower version of Watching the Detectives and a bluesy Pump it Up closed the set proper.   New bass player Faragher may not have the fluid moves of Bruce Thomas, but proved a capable replacement and sang great back-up as well. Nieve was a bit low in the mix, but sounded great nonetheless. Drummer Pete Thomas is certainly not mellowing with age either.     The first encore had an acoustic feel, as Elvis played a beautiful rendition of Deep Dark Truthful Mirror (nothing can top the original piano and brass arrangement, but this came damn close). He then tacked on a wonderful version of Smokey Robinsons You Really Got a Hold on Me, before going back into the original song. Patsy Clines Sweet Dreams, which Elvis covered on Almost Blue (his 1981 country-western album) closed the first encore perfectly.   The second encore focused more on the rowdy numbers. As Elvis and the band reemerged (with Elvis himself showing the crowd a Red Sox jersey with Costello 03 on the back), they tore into I Hope Youre Happy Now, Tear Off Your Own Head and the epic Man Out of Time before slowing things down with the anti-war Shipbuilding and then speeding back up again with an exhaustive rendition of (Whats So Funny Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding (world affairs seemed to have a hand in the setlist).   Former Black Crowes vocalist Chris Robinson seemed like an odd choice for an opening act, but his short acoustic set was well-received and sounded great. He played acoustic guitar and was joined by another guitarist.   My only major beef was that there was absolutely NO Elvis merchandise on sale. Im a concert t-shirt guy  I pretty much always buy a concert shirt. The extremely unhelpful duo selling Robinsons merch at the show mumbled something along the lines of Elvis' management didnt think that it would be profitable. Huh? Folks, Ive been to shows where the acts made less money than the audience members, and they still sold stuff. Mike Keneally is one of the hardest-working, least rewarded artists in the universe and he sells three or four different t-shirts and several CDs at every show Ive seen. Youre telling me that Elvis Costello, a multi-millionaire, cant afford the dollar or two it takes to print up each shirt -- especially when they usually go for about thirty bucks?   Okay, rant mode off. The show itself was excellent.

       five new discs and one happy blogger   Twice a year (usually in July and again around November, to facilitate Christmas shopping), Borders does something nice for its employees by holding a 40 percent off employee weekend on most of their products. We already get a nice year-round discount (25 percent for full-timers and 33 percent for part-timers, like me), but that extra percentage really makes a nice difference. It doesnt apply to everything, though; DVDs are still 20 percent across the board, and periodicals 15 percent. But in a way, those restrictions are a big help, because they force me to place parameters on the needless stuff I end up buying in these situations.  Fortunately, I took advantage of 40 percent off weekend and only spent $6.02. I was lucky enough to be named my stores employee of the month, an honor that carries with it a cheesy Polaroid photo on a plaque near our breakroom, in addition to a lovely $50 store gift certificate. (Note: I am not deliberately tooting my own horn; the employee of the month part of the story is simply being used to aid the narrative thread).    So, with gift card in hand, I punched out of my Saturday shift at noon and picked up five CDs that I had been hanging on to for a few days. Wanna know what they are? Sure you do.    urlLink Beethoven, Lieder (Dietrich Henschel)    Last year, I managed to snag a free copy of a Harmonia Mundi sampler and since then, Ive managed to purchase at least seven discs that were featured on it. One of them was a collection of lieder by Erich Korngold, sung by Dietrich Henschel. I enjoyed it a great deal, and when this Beethoven lieder collection  also sung by Henschel  was released earlier this month, I jumped at the chance to hear this great singer once again. Im enjoying this a little more than the previous release, mainly because as far as 20th century classical music goes (like Korngold), its a little harder for me to get into the vocal stuff. Beethovens songs are a little more traditional and therefore easier to digest. (As open-minded as I am about classical music, modern opera is one of the hardest pills for me to swallow in that format)   urlLink  Elvis Costello, Mighty Like a Rose    Ive spent the last two years rebuilding my EC catalog after it was all stolen in a burglary (along with all my Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Miles Davis and Bob Marley  kudos to the burglars for their good taste). Fortunately, Rhino Records has made it a little easier for me by reissuing Elvis entire catalog, three releases at a time, for the past year or two (I still believe that they were responsible for the burglary, those bastards). Rhino has outdone the otherwise excellent Rykodisc EC reissues by making every reissue a two-disc affair, with the standard album on disc one, and an entire disc of bonus tracks on disc two. I waited a while to get Mighty Like a Rose, mainly because I never felt it was one of his stronger works. While I still wouldnt put it in my EC Top Ten, after listening to it Saturday afternoon I concluded that it is still quite a strong album, albeit with a few weak tracks. If you enjoy the everything-including-the-kitchen-sink beautiful baroque mess of ECs 1988 album Spike, this one is along those same lines. Call it Spike II.   urlLink The Jam, Setting Sons   -- Although Ive been a Jam fan for just about as long as Ive been an Elvis Costello fan, I havent been too quick on picking up individual Jam releases, mainly because they havent had a good reissue program for some time. Recently, Universal saw fit to correct that error, and Setting Sons, the fourth Jam album, is the latest in my collection. It contains several of my favorite Jam songs (Eton Rifles, Thick as Thieves), in addition to a slew of b-sides and rarities, and one of my favorite Jam covers (their superb take on Martha and the Vandellas Heat Wave).    urlLink  Stravinsky, Rite of Spring (Valery Gergiev, Kirov Orchestra)    While I prefer smaller ensembles for modern classical music (string quartets, piano sonatas), the power of Stravinskys most famous work in undeniable. Arguably one of the best-known and most controversial pieces of modern music, its 1913 Paris premiere literally caused a riot. While I already own a lesser-known recording of this composition (which I received for free last year), I jumped at the chance to pick up a copy of this, mainly since it was recently reissued as part of the Gramophones Choice series (a series of notable recordings that were all given extremely positive reviews by the excellent British magazine  urlLink  Gramophone ). If you like your classical music scary, noisy and foreboding, by all means, get this.    urlLink Yes, Remixes   Go ahead and laugh, everyone else does. First of all, heres my standard prog-rock apology: progressive rock is one of the music formats that I constantly have to defend (see my April 8 entry, The mellotron players wearing a cape). While Ill admit that a large portion of this format is silly and pretentious, there is a lot of it that I admire a great deal, not only for the skill required to play the music, but also the eclectic nature of some of the genres best stuff (this is a result of growing up with three older siblings who loved prog, back when it was oddly labeled art rock). Yes have certainly made their share of icky music, but three of their albums are, in my opinion, amazing classics that I revisit often:  urlLink  The Yes Album  (1970),  urlLink  Fragile  (1971) and  urlLink  Close to the Edge  (1972). With that in mind, when I saw that a collection of Yes remixes was being released, I jumped at the chance (knowing full well that it may sound like utter crap, but was dying to hear it out of curiosity). The tracks were all remixed by Virgil Howe, the son of Yes guitarist Steve Howe. While Im no expert in the remix field, I have heard my fair share of remixes, and this is a highly enjoyable album. Ive already read some reviews on Amazon, which are equally positive and negative. The negative ones are mostly by old farts who apparently dont understand the concept of remixes. It sounds like the CD is defective! sputters one reviewer who wouldnt know Fatboy Slim from Fat Albert. Heres a lesson in musical open-mindedness: theres nothing wrong with manipulating older songs to give them a fresh perspective. Wake up and smell the 21st century. I first listened to this disc on my headphones while walking downtown Saturday afternoon and I literally giggled out loud at least twice, which must have looked interesting to my fellow pedestrians. Hearing a trip-hopped Heart of the Sunrise and a funky, drum-machine infested Siberian Khatru certainly had a giddy effect on me, considering the fact that Ive known these songs by heart since I was about nine years old.

       step away from the camera   Looking at other people's photos, I can't help thinking that there is a huge chunk of the world's population that has no idea how to take pictures. Now, I don't claim to be Richard Avedon or anything, but I *have* taken a couple of photography courses (in high school and in the military) and have even done so - peripherally - for a living. I understand that there are people who have had absolutely zero training in the art of photography. So I'm here to help.

       it's a dry heat   Im safe and sound and back on the ground in Boston, and boy did I have a nice, stress-free enjoyable time in Phoenix. The last time I posted it was Saturday afternoon. Saturday night was a nice relaxed affair as Liza and I took our 2,500th dip in the pool, ate some dinner, and were given a  urlLink Target  gift certificate from her sister for our babysitting duties earlier in the day. Then we all sat around the living room watching  urlLink "The Godfather"  on HBO. Did I mention that Lizas parents have digital cable? Something like two billion channels, a super-friendly on-screen TV guide feature, and every pay channel you could think of. Nice.  Sunday, Liza and I hit the retail trail and spent the Target gift certificate (and then some). Liza bought two pairs of shoes and I got a nifty CD-player clock radio. Ive always wanted one of those and now I have one. Then I visited a local  urlLink Borders  and used my employee discount on two CDs:  urlLink "Early Music"  by the always amazing Kronos Quartet and  urlLink "Take a Break,"  the latest effort by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. I also picked up a copy of a book Ive been wanting to read for years:  urlLink "Paris to the Moon"  by Adam Gopnik.    urlLink Me First and the Gimme Gimmes  are not exactly a hit in the hard-core punk indie community, but theyve always been a glorious guilty pleasure for me. Basically, theyre a punk/pop supergroup (consisting of members of NOFX, Lagwagon, and No Use for a Name) who do nothing but punked-up covers, mostly oldies. The albums are usually arranged by theme: Have a Ball covers mostly 70s hits; Are a Drag decimates showtunes; Blow in the Wind takes care of the 60s and the latest one skewers R&B, old (Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin) and new (R. Kelly, Whitney Houston). Some may say the shtick gets old, but for the life of me, I cant seem to get sick of these guys. I seriously want them to play at my wedding.   We also discovered a rather scrumptious restaurant chain down there in Phoenix (although they might have them elsewhere, I dont know). Its called  urlLink Bahama Breeze.  Liza had never heard of it, so it could be a new thing. I guess you could call it a family restaurant. It had a sort of island theme, with the staff all dressed in Hawaiian shirts and whatnot, and reggae music piped through the PA. As cheesy as the atmosphere seemed, the food was amazing. If youre hungry and happen to pass by one of these places, check it out.   Sunday night was spent dining at Lizas sisters house and Monday was spent at the airport, on a plane for five hours, and back in Boston. Fun trip. Minimal turbulence on the plane, thus a minimally freaked out Chris. Yay. Now all I have to look forward to is this Saturdays  urlLink Elvis Costello  show. Oh, is that it? Just Elvis? Jesus, I cant wait. Elvis is King.   Id like to get back into essay mode sometime soon  I havent written a good screed advocating a particularly good musical artist or film in a while. Look for that soon. This week. Really.

       if i told you, i would have had to kill you   Here I am! Where am I? Why, in Phoenix, Arizona, of course. Liza and I got here Thursday afternoon and will return to Boston on Monday afternoon. Why haven't I written word one about this trip in my blog? Because it was a surprise. Let me explain. Liza's mother's fiftieth birthday was last Thursday and Liza's dad flew us out to Phoenix for a surprise visit (it was a surprise for her mom, not for us -- we've known about it for more than a month). Needless to say, when her mom saw us lounging in her living room Thursday afternoon, she proceeded to freak out. In a good way.   Liza's dad didn't stop with plane tickets for the two of us, no sir. He took us, along with Liza's mother, sister, brother-in-law, neice and nephew to a place called Gold Canyon Golf Resort, where we spent yesterday afternoon to this morning, lounging, swimming, eating, drinking and watching Liza's mom swoon over her birthday presents. And while the resort is kinda in the middle of nowhere, we were still able to witness fireworks on the horizon coming from Tempe.   This Gold Canyon resort is a pretty nice place (and I would provide a link for you, but I'm on Liza's sister's computer, which is a bit temperamental, so I'm not going to fuck around with creating links if you don't mind). Each couple got their own little suite, and everyone gets driven around in golf carts. I find out more and more that people just aren't into walking anywhere in this part of the country, but I suppose 100-plus temperatures are partly to blame. Anyway, we spent a good part of yesterday afternoon in the resort's lovely swimming pool, then returned to our suites for quick showers, and proceeded to the bar & grill for a couple of beers at the "bar" (where I was informed, sadly, of Barry White's passing) and a wonderful dinner at the "grill."    After the aforementioned present-opening and fireworks-watching, Liza and I returned to our room to find out that our key-card thing didn't work. We walked over to the front desk where the woman working there aplogized profusely and gave us two new keys. Which didn't work. We walked back to the desk again. More profuse apologies. The bellboy brought us back (via the omnipresent golf cart) with master key-card in hand. Didn't work. Apparently the key-card door mechanism had a dead battery. I cursed "advances" in technology while Alfonzo the maintenance dude was summoned to open our back patio, which was locked with a bona fide regular, non-electronic lock. Alfonzo didn't have the right key, more employees were thrown into the mix, and suffice it to say that it took an hour for us to get into our room. We were consoled with even more profuse apologies and free breakfast the next morning. But in the grand scheme of things it was really no big deal and so far our mini-vacation has been splendid. Currently I'm at Liza's sister's house with Liza, babysitting the neice and nephew while Liza's sister and brother-in-law are out running errands. No big plans for the rest of the weekend, but no plan is a good plan as far as I'm concerned. If we get bored we can always go for a swim in her parents' pool.   Oh, and did I tell you that Liza, fully aware of my aversion to flying, bought me a Bill Hicks CD for the trip? Oh yeah. A four-and-a-half hour plane trip is no match for caustic, sarcastic venom-spewing stand-up genius.

       the confused urbanite   I've been having the strangest notion lately -- well, I guess you don't really "have" notions, to be more accurate, you tend to "entertain" them. Anyway, I've been thinking a lot about where I am right now, not really in an abstract sense, just "where I am." Geographically. In Boston. You see, I'm originally from this fine state, and although I've lived in a ton of other places over the years (including nearly half my life overseas), I've always considered myself a Bostonian, even more so since I've moved here, presumably for good, in February 1999 after my abrupt departure from Italy. My father was born in nearby Malden and grew up in a variety of different towns on the ouskirts. My mother was born in Somerville and lived in nearby Medford, etc. So I'm from here and my parents are from here.   I love the city. Urban life is very exciting to me. The mundane parts of it are even interesting, even if it's just on a sociological level. The subway interests me. I love walking the streets. I love elevators. The proximity of tall buildings. The culture, the traffic, the honking of horns.   But maybe not so much anymore.   As much as I love taking the subway and loathe the responsibility, paperwork and costs involved in owning and operating a car, I've been getting more and more frustrated lately at the necessity of "carrying my shit around." What I'm trying to say is, as a subway commuter and pavement-pounder, I don't have a trunk or backseat to throw my stuff into (or onto). When I leave the house for the day, I take my messenger bag that almost always contains my CD player, my 24-disc CD case, a book, and perhaps a few other things. They add up, and when you have to drag this stuff around with you all day, it gets frustrating. If I want to stay over at Liza's place, I have to make sure that I have clothes over there, or else I have to stuff some underwear socks, etc, in the bag (or bring a separate bag that makes me seem like some sort of vagrant). And let's not even get into the problems associated with food shopping.   And then there's the subway. It's a necessary evil, and as relatively reliable as it tends to be, it forces me to do one more thing on somebody else's timetable. Instead of just saying to myself, "Anna's Taqueria. That's a 15-minute drive. I'm meeting Liza there at 8, so I'll leave at 7:45," I have to figure in how long the T will take, how long it may take -- worse-case scenario -- to wait for *two* trains, since I have to change from the red line to the green line at Park Street, in addition to walking to and from each station. All this for a super carnitas burrito with my girlfriend. I need a damn calculator every time I leave the house.   I could go on and on, but the point is that I'm starting to get fed up with the city and sometimes I feel that the cons outweigh the pros. In the past, I've occasionally -- though not entirely seriously -- broached the subject of moving to Liza's home state of Arizona. The last time I brought it up was a couple of days ago, and while she feels that eventually we may make our way out there, it's just not really conceivable at this juncture. I realize that she needs to finish school first, but from a long-term professional standpoint (hers), there aren't a lot of theater programs out in the desert. For her, city living's where it's at. For now.   I read posts by  urlLink Tom  out in Phoenix about his new car and how he swings by all these places on his way home from work and I get jealous. I think about Liza's parents, quite possibly the nicest people you could ever meet, along with Liza's sister, her husband and their two kids, and I long for my long-lost suburban life. Am I getting too old? Is this type of life really what I need? Will it make me healthier? Could I live without urban culture that I hold so dear? They have Banana Republic there. They have Borders. Tough-to-find CDs can be ordered online.   Then again, I may get over this in a few days. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a hot, smelly subway to board.

       time for a facelift?   I'm thinking about changing the basic template for this blog. I really like the color scheme, but I have a feeling that the font size is way too small. On the other hand, my 71-year-old father (perhaps Pressure Drop's biggest fan) has never complained about the tiny type.   Since this is basic Blogger and my knowledge of html is laughable at best, my choices are basically whatever "looks" Blogger offers me. So if you read this site regularly and want to weigh in on whether or not I should shake things up, drop me a line.

       okay, we get it! Britney and Madonna made out! Who cares?   While I personally feel that MTV and its umpteen self-congratulatory award shows make Bruckheimer look like Bergman, I had to laugh and thoroughly enjoy  urlLink Ryan's  play-by-play of last night's Video Music Awards. I hope you do too.   And while I'm in a pop-culture frame of mind...I certainly enjoy those VH1 "I Love the 80s" and "I Love the 70s" shows that they keep airing ad nausem, but jeez,  urlLink that guy from "Ed"  certainly has a lot of time on his hands, doesn't he? Is there any pop culture reference he  doesn't  have an opinion on? I'm waiting for him to say, "How about those Toughskin pants that Chris Ingalls wore back in the 70s? What's that all about?" And while I agree that   urlLink Mo Rocca  is indeed a funny individual, his VH1 blurbs are getting old. It's the same thing every time: thoughtful gaze, dry, sardonic comment on a particular cheesy TV show/fashion statement/rock group, sarcastic zinger about its "merits."   Okay, Mo, you're funny. Now go back to the Daily Show where you belong, making me pee my pants from laughter.

       the stuffed basement   She's not leaving for Europe for another six days, but Liza already started posting on  urlLink her blog  last night. Just a little introduction and random thoughts about her upcoming trip. If she sounds like she's hopped up on speed, she's not. That's just the way she writes. Plus, she's just a tad stressed out from her lengthy "to do" list.   The biggest thing on that list by far involves moving out of her apartment. Since she's going to be gone for three months and isn't into the whole sublet thing, Liza is just plain moving out of her Brighton apartment and will find a place when she gets back in December. She's found a way to move all of her stuff out without a) renting storage space or b) renting a U-Haul. That's what happens when you have friends with trucks and a boyfriend with a basement. Wednesday night, her friend Isabelita (a.k.a. Izzy) got a friend of hers with a mini-van to bring the first load of stuff over. Part II takes place tonight. Liza's friend Missy has a boyfriend with a truck and the rest of the stuff (mostly heavy, ungainly stuff like her bed and kitchen table) will make its way into the dusty, grimy basement of my Dorchester triple-decker at that time. The only problem is that I'm nervous about running out of room. My roommate Frank and I have one little space set aside in the basement for our stuff, and it's filling up fast. Let's hope that Liza comes down with a case of Let's Throw Stuff Away pretty quickly.   Once the move is done, I can start figuring out how the hell I'm going to survive the next three months by myself.

       new release tuesday: the aftermath   Have you been waiting for me to comment on this week's CD purchases? No? Well, as you may have read earlier, Tuesday evening I snagged three of the brand new  urlLink Yes  remasters ( urlLink "Close to the Edge,"   urlLink "Tales From Topographic Oceans"  and  urlLink "Relayer" ) in addition to the latest (and final) Warren Zevon album,  urlLink "The Wind."   First things first: the new Zevon album is very, very good. I wouldn't put it in his Top Five, but it's still very strong, with excellent singing, playing and writing throughout. It does occasionally veer into some fairly sappy lyrical territory (in songs like "El Amor de Mi Vida" and "Please Stay"), but for crying out loud, the man is dying of cancer. Let him reflect all he wants. Plus, he's written a veritable truckload of masterpieces in the last 30 years, so he's entitled to rest on his laurels a bit. But there are only a couple of tracks that don't really do anything for me -- most of the songs are top-notch. The grand piano-driven "Numb as a Statue" harks back to his late seventies heyday. "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" may be a too-obvious cover choice, but it's done extremely well (although, like "Twist and Shout," it's the kind of song that's pretty hard to fuck up). I'm not much of a Springsteen fan, but "Disorder in the House," Warren's collaboration with The Boss, kicks lots of ass. Overall, a very strong album, and a fitting swan song.    urlLink Rhino  has been doing a splendid job of remastering and reissuing the Yes catalog, several albums at a time, and this batch is no different. Four releases by my favorite guilty pleasure have been added this week. 1972's "Close to the Edge" is one of my favorite Yes albums, with the title track spanning the entire first side of the vinyl and "And You and I" and "Siberian Khatru" rounding things off on side two. It doesn't really let your CD player's "random" button do much work, but prog rock is all about the endless experimentation and showing off musical chops while pondering mysticism and Tolkein. And this album does it pretty damn well. The bonus tracks include a couple of "single" edits and alternate takes.   1973's "Tales From Topographic Oceans" is pretty much just as bloated and overreaching as most of its critics claim, but that doesn't make it any less fun. There's something satisfying about consuming four twenty-minute suites spread across two discs. Celebrating pointless excess is something I recommend to any self-respecting music fan from time to time. In all honesty, while the band tends to veer off course -- inspiring listeners to use the fast forward button generously -- the playing is superb and true to form, Yes does in fact have an ear for catchy melodies.   (Interesting Yes-related tangent: have you seen/heard the latest Volkswagen commercial, featuring music by  urlLink Polyphonic Spree?  The first time I saw that commercial, I thought to myself, "Damn! They sound just like Yes!" And they're supposedly getting oodles of critical acclaim, too. Does that mean the critics secretly love Yes?)  Anyway, the third Yes disc I bought on Tuesday, 1974's "Relayer," is perhaps the most exciting revelation of the three. An album I heard briefly several years ago, it has a fresh, vital sound, thanks to the arrival of some new talent (Patrick Moraz, who replaced mad wizard keyboard player Rick Wakeman) and a shift toward more aggressive soloing and an almost jazz-fusion sound. Beautiful stuff.   All the remasters contain bonus tracks, tons of new liner notes and exciting Digipak cases. Mmmm...Digipak...

       recommended use of a visa card   I just bought three tickets for  urlLink Brad Mehldau's  Sept. 24 show at Scullers. Yay! I'm going with Bob and Bryan, two fellow Borders employees/music fanatics.  Brad is a jazz pianist who sounds a bit like a cross between Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett with a nasty experimental streak. His last album, "Largo," was easily one of my favorite discs of 2002. In addition to traditional jazz/bebop piano/bass/drums trio stuff, he also has great taste in covers (he's recorded versions of at least two Radiohead songs).   If you like jazz played well, or just want to see an amazingly talented young man blow the roof off a jazz club, see Brad. He's doing three nights at Scullers (9/24-26). And buy  urlLink "Largo."

       in praise of the nitpicker   Terry Welch, one of my best friends from my Navy days (we first met about 10 years ago) is a hell of a guy, not to mention one of the smartest people I know. His blog,  urlLink nitpicker,  is a shining example of  erudite leftism.   When a right-wing blog called "Right Thinking From the Left Coast" (I won't provide a link -- find it yourself) dubbed Nitpicker an "Idiot Leftie Blog du Jour," Terry one-upped the guy by linking the "award" onto the top of his site. Bravo.   The Right Thinking dude went so far (in his unfocused right-thinking rage, one would guess) as to call Terry an "asshat." Am I the only one unfamiliar with this term? Asshat? I've heard of "assmunch," even "assface" (a personal favorite). But "asshat" is a new one for me. Perhaps it means "intelligent." That would make sense in this context.

       i'm feeling a bit petulant today   I've decided to delete my link to the fellow Boston blogger whose site goes by the name "I look good." If you normally use my site to find her link, I apologize. I don't feel like sponsoring her anymore. Her whole intellectual snob-cum-alcoholic shtick is boring me. Also, she trashed Borders (my part-time place of employment) in her most recent post. First she refers to it -- twice! -- as "Border's" (no apostrophe, dammit!), then complains that we are always understocked and underhelpful (or words to that effect). I suppose I should have just let it slide, but for some reason it just rubbed be the wrong way. Whatever.

       just say yes   Tomorrow is Tuesday. Street date! Lots of new stuff coming out on CD and DVD. As you can imagine from my previous post, I have every intention of picking up (sometime this week if possible) the latest (and sadly, final) release from  urlLink Warren Zevon,  "The Wind."   Allow me to indulge my guilty pleasure known as prog rock and tell you about some other new releases as well. Everybody's favorite bloated band of hyper-noodling mystics,  urlLink Yes,  are continuing their reissue project (in conjunction with the good folks at  urlLink Rhino ) with the release of special editions of "Close to the Edge," "Tales From Topographic Oceans," "Relayer" and "Going for the One." I plan on eventually picking up all but the last one. "Close to the Edge" is one of the three Yes albums (along with "The Yes Album" and "Fragile") that I consider undeniable classics. Pretentious? Sure. But I still love it. I own a 14-year-old CD of "Close to..." and it's high time I upgrade it.   "Tales..." is a different story altogether. The album is routinely cited as the ultimate example of what is wrong with prog. It's considered the nadir of the genre and at least one Amazon.com reviewer praises it simply because its bloated excesses helped birth punk rock. How bloated? It consists of four songs, all approximately 20 minutes long, spread out over two records (or discs, in this case). To make matters worse, the album was inspired by hippie-dippy vocalist/lyricist Jon Anderson's discovery of some sort of Asian Shastric scriptures or something. Still awake? Well, okay then. Guess what? I'm still probably going to buy it. I remember when my brother Gary bought this album in the fall of 1983. I loved it, but it didn't really stand up to repeated listenings. Maybe it was drowned out by the critics' protests. Call me crazy, but all the negative buzz (in addition to the fact that not having heard it in 20 years) has aroused my curiosity.   I will probably get "Relayer" too. It has two strikes against it: drummer extraordinaire Bill Bruford ain't on it (he left to join  urlLink King Crimson  before "Tales" was released); and keyboard player Rick Wakeman (the original Caped One) vamoosed as well, replaced by Patrick Moraz. But what little I've heard of the album (several years ago, mind you) intrigues me. It supposedly has an aggressive, fusion feel to it.   All the Yes remasters come with bonus tracks, extended liner notes and slip cases. I love all that stuff.   If you're interested in reading some good, unbiased reviews of Yes (or any other prog bands), I urge you to check out  urlLink Ground and Sky,  an excellent prog review site. The site is easy to navigate and the reviews are intelligent and thoughtful. Oh, and one reviewer tells of a Pink Floyd/Wizard of Oz-type game you can play with "Relayer" and  urlLink "2001: a Space Odyssey."  Far out!

       he'll sleep when he's dead   Yesterday I made sure that anything and everything I had to do was done in plenty of time to watch  urlLink VH1's documentary on Warren Zevon.  The program, entitled "Inside/Out," chronicled the life and times of the legendary singer/songwriter since last August, when he learned he was diagnosed with  urlLink mesothelioma,  a rare and terminal form of cancer. In addition to being the subject of a documentary, Warren -- who was initially given three months to live, one year ago -- decided to write and record one last album. That album,  urlLink "The Wind,"  will be released tomorrow.   Not surprisingly, Warren's diagnosis has given him more press coverage than he's probably ever received. The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe and countless other publications and media outlets have been vying for his attention. This VH1 program is probably the most any fan has ever seen of Warren's day-to-day life, including many revealing moments in the studio.  For this final hurrah, friends and admirers of Warren's have asked to make appearances, including Bruce Springsteen, David Lindley, Jackson Browne, Ry Cooder and Emmylou Harris. The documentary includes doctors' visits, photo shoots, studio sessions and a particarly emotional appearace last October on  urlLink David Letterman's show.  For that gig, Dave, a huge Zevon fan, devoted the entire episode to Warren, interviewing him and letting him perform three songs.   Some of the documentary's most disarming moments include some tough-to-handle recording sessions, as Warren's health begins to deteriorate and he takes on stronger doses of painkillers. In one scene, co-songwriter/producer Jorge Calderon asks Warren if he's up for one more vocal take, while Warren sits by the microphone with bottles of meds in his lap. Warren's daughter Ariel announces that she's pregnant with twins and plans to name one of them after her father. Too weak to make it to the studio for later sessions, Warren records a take of "Keep Me In Your Heart" seated in his living room while friends look on admiringly.   If it sounds like a sloppy, emotional pity-fest, think again. Zevon, whose morbid sense of humor has always kept death at arm's length, is known as a musical and lyrical tough guy with a strong dose of wry wit. Kind of a rock and roll combination of Norman Mailer, Martin Scorcese and Ernest Hemingway. Anyone who's regularly written songs about mercenaries, mass murderers, werewolves and alcoholics deserves to sit back and get reflective while staring death in the face.   Warren Zevon is not in the rock and roll hall of fame, has never appeared on MTV's Total Request Live and will never outsell Madonna or P. Diddy. But his death will be an enormous blow to anyone who's ever appreciated songwriting with wit, class and intelligence.

       funny millie, brilliant andy and wooden mike    urlLink Millie  is not only funny; she has pretty damn good taste in music to boot. In her August 21 post she speaks adoringly of  urlLink XTC,  who fit easily in my list of Top Ten Favorite Bands in the Universe (there really isn't such a list, but if there were...XTC would definitely be in it, probably around seven or eight). For what it's worth,  urlLink Mike Keneally  is a pretty big XTC fan as well. And it's a mutual admiration: XTC singer/songwriter Andy Partridge, who writes such brilliant pop songs it makes my head spin just thinking about it, wrote a loving blurb on Keneally's website  about MK's delicious 2001 album,  urlLink "Wooden Smoke."   So there you go. Check out Millie and check out XTC (and Keneally too, while you're at it). Those are my latest recommendations.   I also want to write about last night's VH1 special on Warren Zevon, as well as some of tomorrow's new releases. Probably this afternoon. Stick around.

       a decidedly un-freaky friday   One of the hardest things about returning to blogging after a long absence is wondering how to resume. Seriously. I don't really know where to start. What I  can  tell you is that our trip to Maryland went amazingly well. The last time I posted was Sunday night. Monday my mother and I took my daughter Audrey (who was visiting from Illinois, where she lives with her mom) clothes shopping for the coming school year. Tuesday Liza and I took Audrey to see   urlLink "Freaky Friday,"  which Audrey had already seen back home but really wanted to see again. Like most films aimed at the pre-teen set, it was fairly predictable, with a generous smattering of lameness. But I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. I laughed out loud several times. So to all of you who scoff at my snooty obsessions with  urlLink Bergman  and  urlLink Kubrick:  chill out, already. I laughed heartily during a cheesy "body-switch" movie.   The road trip back to Boston on Wednesday was relatively eventless, with my sister Julie generously taking all the driving chores while I was the DJ and Liza...well, hung out in the back seat, basically. Two things I learned on this trip: Connecticut is the most annoying, headache-inducing, traffic-clogged state to drive through; and Cheesequake, New Jersey, is perhaps the funniest town name in the history of the United States. I defy you to find a funnier one.   Wednesday was a bit hectic, what with getting back into the grind at work and implementing all the fun new responsibilities of my re-tooled job position, but I managed. I'm in a new cubicle, which doesn't have that  snazzy Boston skyline view anymore, but I have to admit that my current view of the intersection of Longwood and Brookline Avenues is much more fun on a people-watching level. hen you think about it, the skyline doesn't really  do  anything. It just sits there.   I came in nicely under-budget on my trip, so I celebrated by blowing some money at Borders last night. I got a copy of a fabulous 15th century mass by a French composer named Antoine Brumel. It's called  urlLink "Et Ecce Terrae Motus"  (I heard a sample from a free  urlLink Harmonia Mundi  sampler I received recently) and is really something. I also satiated my love for all things espionage by getting a copy of the controversial book  urlLink "The Puzzle Palace,"  which is basically an expose of the ultra-secret National Security Agency. I was inspired to pick up the book last weekend when we drove by the NSA headquarters in Maryland. Oh, and I also broke down and bought the box set of the first two seasons of  urlLink "Homicide: Life on the Street."  Holy shit, was that a great TV show or what? For the life of me, I still can't figure out why it only garnered a tiny (but mighty) cult following, despite the fact that it received multiple  urlLink Peabody Awards  and was hailed by every critic under the sun. No matter. It lives on in the DVD format. I watched the pilot episode last night and plan to hold a little "Homicide" marathon over the weekend.   What else is going on this weekend? Well, there's a going away party for two Borders employees tonight -- Nate aka "Hate" and Steph are sadly leaving the Boston area. Nate is trailing behing the Border Mass Exodus of 2001 and heading for the Pacific Northwest, while Steph -- true to form -- is settling down in lovely Las Vegas. Liza's starting to get the sniffles so we probably won't stay long. Just long enough to see someone throw up or the cops get called. Either way, we'll be happy.   Speaking of Liza, I've saved the best news for last: Liza is starting a blog of her own. Actually, I started it for her this morning. Since she's going to be spending the fall semester abroad, she figured this would be the best way to keep the peeps back in the States abreast of her goings-on in Europe. So there's not much on the site at the moment, but in the meantime --  urlLink here it is.   Have an absolutely peachy weekend.

       adventures in tourism   I'm a little over halfway through my week-long excursion in leafy Columbia, Maryland. Liza, my sister Julie and I drove down here to spend about six days with my mom, who moved down here about two years ago with Charlie, her amour of the last thirteen years or so. Also, my 10 1/2-year-old daughter Audrey flew out here from Chicago. Now I know how all those tour-ons who I scowl at when I'm home in Boston feel like. Boy, have I ever been a tourist these past few days. So far we visited a handful of historical sites in Washington, DC, in addition to Annapolis (which is really really nice and I was able to dial down my pacifism enough to thoroughly enjoy a tour of the Naval Academy) and the Washington Zoo (or the Smithsonian National Zoo or whatever the hell they call it).   I don't have much of an urge to discuss any current events. Well, maybe the blackout. Holy crap, was that weird or what? Of course it was inevitable that my mother draw comparisons to the 1965 East Coast Blackout and how at the time everyone was freaked out that a Russian invasion was imminent. It was enough to make me want to don a skinny tie and trip over the ottoman, Dick Van Dyke-style.   Now if you don't mind, there are steaks on the grill and I musn't be antisocial.

       still the man   I was going to write a long, detailed review of the  urlLink Joe Jackson  concert Liza, Julie, Julie's friend Paula and I attended at Avalon last Sunday, but if you want an accurate assessment of the show, check out my review of the April 4 show at the Paradise. It was very much the same show, especially considering the fact that they were both amazing. Joe and his late seventies band (Graham Maby, Dave Houghton and Gary Sanford) are still an incredibly tight, sharp band, capable of both tender crooning and old-school punk/new wave asskicking. Get yourself to a JJ show while his tour is still going on.   Sunday night's Joe Jackson highlights:  Guitarist Gary Sanford, still recovering from a broken foot, was seated at an office-stype swivel chair (on wheels) during the show, but he ended up gleefully spinning his way around the stage during especially intense, up-tempo portions of the show.   At Maby's insistence, the entire audience sang "Happy Birthday" to Joe when he came out for the encore -- his birthday was the next day.  Joe's solo piano portion of the show: "Be My Number Two," "Real Men" and "A Slow Song."  The fact that "Is She Really Going Out With Him" will never, ever get old, even 25 years later, and can turn any venue into a giant karaoke bar.   The fact that Joe is the dorkiest rock star dancer since the Beautiful South's Paul Heaton.   ...and that's just off the top of my head. Joe's pushing fifty and I doubt I'll ever be as cool as him.

       Gregory Hines, 1946-2003   It's always sad when a deeply talented and loved person passes. This is no exception. While I don't necessarily consider myself the president of the Gregory Hines Fan Club, I have immense respect for his talent and accomplishments. You don't have to be a tapdancing expert to watch Hines in action and say to yourself, "that is one talented individual." Liza, a lifelong dancer (and a pretty damn good tapdancer to boot) is especially saddened by this.

       insert obligatory arnold movie quote here   I don't normally get too bogged down with politics on this site...if you want political blogging,  urlLink here's  someone who knows what they're talking about. But this whole California election recall seems a bit stupid to me.   Gray Davis may be a crappy governor (I don't know, since I don't really follow California politics), but from what I understand, he has done nothing illegal. It's just that the general consensus is that he sucks at being governor. Whether that is true or not, why do we have to convince the people of California that a "do-over" is what they need? This isn't a sixth-grade kickball game we're talking about. Hey, while we're at it, can we "recall" Dubya? Count me in on that one.   And then there's Arnold. Can someone please explain to me what his qualifications are for governing the third-largest state in the union? Oh, he's a movie star? Great! Get his ass to Sacramento, pronto!The sad thing is, he has the highest name-recognition factor of any of the hundreds of bozos on the ballot -- more people know him than the incumbent. So he'll probably win. Then, when the dust settles, it'll be the ultimate "morning after." Hungover voters in bent party hats, sitting among the ruins of empty bottles and scattered confetti, wondering what they were thinking.   Then, another recall! What a vicious circle.

       when work gets in the way of blogging   The scant few of you who read this blog on a daily basis may have noticed a general lack of posting lately. My job is mostly to blame for that. Lots of changes, mostly good. I was interviewed for a job -- a sort of "lateral transfer" -- within my department and I did not get it. But my current job is being modified to include a lot of interesting, creative things. I'm going to be a lot busier, but doing things I enjoy. Part of this change also involved me moving to a different desk, which is more frustrating than you might think. All computer equipment in our office is locked down, literally. So anytime you need to move a piece of equipment, a locksmith (located in another building) needs to be called. After the locksmith was called and my computer freed from its shackles, I physically moved the PC to its new cubicle. Then the monitor stopped working. Then I had to find a usable one in our junkheap of computer equipment. During all of this I had to do my regular work, all without a working computer. But everything's fine now, thank you.    gas up the honda, let's go   Today feels like Friday. Because tomorrow I'll be starting my vacation. Liza, my sister Julie and I are road-tripping it. We'll be waking up at the crack of dawn, leaving at 5 am and heading south, to Columbia, Maryland. My mom and Charlie (her better half for the last 14 years) are living there now, and we will be seeing them, in addition to the sights and sounds of Baltimore, DC, Annapolis and other points of interest. Julie and Liza will be doing the driving, and since I haven't had a valid driver's license in more than four years (long story, let's not get into it), I've been given the task of...wait for it...compiling music for the trip! What an easy gig. Last night I took my 64-disc case, in addition to my 24-disc case, and put together 88 CDs for the drive. I plan to turn that mother out, as they say. Actually, compiling music for this drive is a bit easier than usual, since I have to keep in mind that there's probably a lot of stuff in my collection that Julie and Liza won't care for. So...no  urlLink Frank Zappa,  no overly "skronky" jazz music, and I suppose my latest obssession with  urlLink King Crimson  will have to take a backseat for the next week or so as well. No big deal, that leaves plenty of room for other audible delights. Liza's also buying some  urlLink Mad Libs.  What trip would be complete without that?  One of the best things about our trip to Maryland is that my daughter Audrey will be flying out from Chicago. Your daughter, Chris? That's right. You all know that I was married for a few years in the early-mid 90s, but I don't know if I've ever mentioned on this blog that my ex and I have a daughter who lives with her in Illinois. I suppose I tried to avoid it for a long time because I thought that blogging about my kid seemed at tad...I don't know...exploitative. But I realize that it's really not, so be prepared in the future to hear more than you ever needed to know about my 10 1/2 year old daughter, who happens to be the greatest kid in the world. Interesting Audrey development...I was talking to her on the phone last week, and this diehard Justin Timberlake fan tells me that she really likes  urlLink the Donnas.  Now I've never, ever been one to tell my daughter that she needs to listen to this band or that band...kids can listen to whatever they want (well...within reason), and if it's a teenybopper singer, fine. Chances are they'll get over that phase eventually, but if they don't -- hey, they don't. Besides, there's nothing more dorky than liking the music your parents like, and I certainly don't want to make Audrey feel dorky. But I have to admit that it's pretty cool that she likes the Donnas.  I still have more things to blog about before my trip, so you haven't heard the last of me today.

       nice shorts, junior   I finally realized the one thing I dislike the most about summer. It's the same thing that  urlLink Bill Hicks  hates about it: all my cool clothes are winter clothes. Walking around in t-shirts and shorts makes me look like a 12-year-old. In the winter, you've got your cool sweaters, coats, corduroy pants...hey, you may be sloshing through knee-deep snow, but at least you can look like an adult.

       my wilco dreams   I had two strange dreams about  urlLink wilco  last night. In the first one, stand-up comic and Saturday Night Live cast member  urlLink Fred Armisen  (who appears briefly -- this is not part of the dream -- in the excellent Wilco documentary  urlLink "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart" ) is doing a stand-up routine in a club and he suddenly introduces Wilco, who appear onstage and play a set to a rapt audience. In the second dream, I'm listening to the Wilco song "Poor Places" and I begin crying uncontrollably.   Are everyone else's dreams as strange as mine?  By the way, if you've never heard Wilco's album  urlLink "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"  you should really check it out. It's worth all the hype times ten and has been regularly blowing my mind since I bought it a little over a year ago.

       This is the twisted weekend of my life   The title of todays post comes from the song Weekend by  urlLink Mike Keneally,  and on the surface it seems to be a fitting way to begin describing my past weekend. But if you know the song, you know that its a harsh, grating, venom-spewing (yet irresistibly rockin) story of a particularly horrific weekend Mr. Keneally experienced several years ago. And my past weekend was really not horrific at all. So I dont know why Im using a line from that song. Maybe its just because the song is called Weekend. Yeah. Thats it.   My weekend was not super-eventful, but enough stuff happened to warrant a recap with little vignettes that wont change your life but wont repulse you with boredom, either (I hope not, anyway).   After work on Friday, I got my haircut on Boylston Street and afterwards, while heading to the subway (grappling with my man-bag, a compulsively-bought cup of coffee and my Walkman), I noticed that, somewhere along the line, my work ID badge had fallen off my belt, leaving only the clip. This would have been a sad inconvenience if not for what happened this morning (more on that later).   Later, after I went home to change, I headed over to Lizas apartment for dinner. The subway ride was a pleasant one as I continued to enjoy my new copy of King Crimsons  urlLink The Power to Believe,  My Borders co-worker Nate took home a free promo copy from the store a couple of months ago, not realizing that I was a budding KC fan. Since he wasnt too crazy about the disc himself, he gave it to me the other day and Ive been enjoying the hell out of it.   Saturday was a fun day at Borders as one of our managers arranged to rent one of those big truck-length dumpsters in order for us to throw away giant heaps of shelving units we no longer use, desks that are broken, non-functioning CD keepers, outdated wooden fixtures, and lots of other stuff that needed to get thrown away. The manager who set this up, Heather, is one of our newer managers and kicks lots of ass. She has a fresh attitude towards the store, especially considering the fact that we have managers and supervisors whove been there forever and refuse to throw anything away. Being the anti-packrat, I seized this opportunity to help rid the store of useless clutter. A lot of the wooden fixtures needed to be broken down before being dumped into the dumpster  and I do mean broken down. We were issued sledgehammers and instructed to go to town. Im telling you, nothing assuages retail frustration more than a heavy hammer against aging wood. Yippee!  Saturday night, Liza and I used her two monthly comp tickets to the  urlLink Improv Asylum  (she works at the box office there part-time). The show was fantastic, as always (the new love song to  urlLink Mitt Romney  is a scream), but about fifteen minutes before the end of the show, the fire alarm went off. Everyone milled about outside the theater for a good ten to fifteen minutes, where Liza stated, what a buzz-kill. We were then instructed to go back inside and watch the rest of the show. About two minutes into the show, the alarm went off again. The audience (and cast) groaned in frustration, everyone headed upstairs, and unfortunately (but understandably), several audience members took off for good. After all, there was only about 10-15 minutes of show left, and the 10 pm show was going to be starting fairly soon. Liza and I toughed it out and headed back into the club, where the audience (only about 25 percent full at this point) was told that they could not continue the show since the 10 pm show was already going to be delayed. We were all issued two free comp tickets for any future show.   I thought this was a great move on the clubs part. Theyre going to take a pretty big loss, not just in handing out some free tickets, but also when you consider that some of the patrons, many of them first-timers, may tell their friends not to waste their time by going to this venue because of one unfortunate event that is in no way typical for this club. Ive been a huge supporter of the Improv Asylum for more than three years, ever since Liza and I started dating. Ive probably seen the show at least a dozen times and its always flat-out hilarious. So if you were in the audience for the Saturday 8 pm show, please come back. A couple of frat boys jokingly pulling a fire alarm in an apartment above the club (thats what I heard, anyway) is not the fault of the establishment.   Sunday morning was a typically lazy one, and I began sorting through some VHS movies that I own but are at Lizas apartment since she has a VCR and I dont anymore. I put on  urlLink Still of the Night,  an obscure mystery thriller starring Roy Scheider and Meryl Streep. Ive always loved this movie, despite the fact that its a bit hokey. There are in fact some genuinely scary scenes and the direction (by Robert Benton, who directed Kramer vs. Kramer, one of my favorite films) is quite good. We all know Meryl Streep is great, but Ive always loved Scheiders work as well. Hes really one of the most underrated actors of his generation.   Liza needed to go downtown around 11:30 for her tap class, so I followed her and picked up a disc I special ordered from Borders: King Crimsons  urlLink Night Watch.  I spent a good hour or so wandering around the city while listening to this disc on my Walkman. Its actually a two-disc live album of a 1973 Amsterdam concert. Im still not completely sold on live Crimson albums. The only other one Ive heard so far is  urlLink USA,  which I really am not crazy about. Night Watch is good, and its really growing on me, but at this point I really prefer their studio stuff.   After Liza and I went home, I continued my search through the long-ignored pile of VHS tapes. We watched the trippy, often mesmerizing  urlLink Altered States  and Spike Lees underrated  urlLink Mo Better Blues  before Nate called us and asked if we wanted to see  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean  at 9:25. We said yeah, and grabbed dinner at Burrito Max in Kenmore Square and walked from there to the theater (Leows Boston Common), which is a really long walk but we had time to kill. Pirates was an enjoyable film, nothing groundbreaking, but fun in a silly, action film kind of way. Johnny Depp was a lot of fun to watch, especially once I heard that his inspiration for this performance was  urlLink Keith Richards.  He really nailed Keiths swaggering wino bit perfectly.   So, this morning. I meant to tell youI received a phone call at work from a woman who found my ID card on Boylston Street Friday night. She doesnt work for our company, but she does consulting for us and has a meeting scheduled in our office on Thursday. Talk about coincidences.

       the friday five   Here it is, ladies and gentlemen...the ultimate cop-out of the writer-blocked blogger: the  urlLink Friday Five!  I decided to do it this week since the questions were a little less dorky than usual. So here we go.  1) What time to you wake up on weekday mornings?  I set my television to turn on automatically at 6:45, and I usually crawl out of bed just before seven.   2) Do you sleep in on the weekends? How late?  Not on Saturdays, because I work a morning shift at Borders on that day. On Sunday, my waking schedule varies. If I have nothing to do and nowhere to go, I will usually get up somewhere between 9:30 and 10:30. Unless I was up late the night before (not likely these days), in which case it would be more in the 11 to 12 range. I usually like the morning. If I could get up at dawn every day, I would. But I can't.  3) Aside from waking up, what is the first thing you do in the morning?  Get a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee, bring it in my bedroom and watch the first fifteen minutes of the Today Show. Yes, I'm a creature of habit.   4) How long does it take to get ready for your day?  I get out of bed just before seven and leave the house around 7:40, so I guess that's about 40 minutes. If I'm rushed, I can do it in 25-30. But I hate being rushed.   5) When possible, what if your favorite place to go for breakfast?  Sunday is the only day I can do that, and I don't do it often. Liza and I love the  urlLink Pour House  on Boyslton Street (excellent brunch, very inexpensive), and when she lived in Allston we used to go to this great place on Harvard Avenue called  urlLink Grecian Yearning  (strange name, great food). I used to love sitting at the counter and watching the dudes work the grill.

       farewell, elia   It seems like he was best known for "naming names" during the McCarthy hearings (an act I'm not condoning), but Elia Kazan also happened to direct "Gentleman's Agreement," "On the Waterfront," "East of Eden," "Viva Zapata," won two Oscars and a Tony, and practically launched the careers of Marlon Brando and James Dean. So please don't call me a fascist if I'm sad that Kazan is  urlLink dead.

       if tomorrow's tuesday...   ...then there must be a veritable buttload of new CD and DVD releases on the way. As for CDs, off the top of my head I know that there's a sweet new Randy Newman  urlLink anthology  on the way, in addition to Lyle Lovett's first  urlLink album  of all-new material in several years (it'll be nice to hear that, after putting up with umpteen compilations and covers projects).   The DVD side of things is where it gets  really  good. First of all, a decent "special edition" of  urlLink "Fargo"  is finally coming out. I firmly believe that the Coen Brothers are the finest filmmakers alive today (since  urlLink Kubrick  died, anyway), and this is probably, in my opinion, their most accomplished overall work. I found  urlLink "The Big Lebowski"  funnier, and  urlLink "The Man Who Wasn't There"  more impressive on a cinematographic scale, but "Fargo" sort of combined the best elements of the Coens' unique style in one masterpiece of a film.   The folks at  urlLink Criterion  are earning their keep as well, releasing an early film of Roman Polanski's (another one of my favorite directors):  urlLink "Knife in the Water,"  which also includes a bonus disc of early Polanski short films. I love you, Criterion.   The long-awaited special edition of  urlLink "The Kids are Alright"  finally hits the shelves. If you're a Who fan, a music historian, or a lover of insightful documentaries on rock stars living to excess, you owe it to yourself to get your hands on this one. I first saw it on HBO in the early eighties, and it's still one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen. It includes their controversially explosive (literally) appearance on the Smothers Brothers TV show, John Entwhistle skeet-shooting, an exuberant Keith Moon leading his bandmates in the studio for a rough-but-rousing version of "Barbara Ann," tons of concert footage and more. Buy it tomorrow. Do it for the music. Do it for the memory of Keith and John.    And last but certainly not least,  urlLink Paul Weller  is releasing a new concert DVD, "Live at Braehead Arena." Oi!

       just a few things that i ain't   As I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, one of my favorite bands,  urlLink the Beautiful South,  will release "Gaze,"  -- their first album of all-new material in three years -- in November. The first single, "Just a Few Things That I Ain't," is available on their website for your listening enjoyment.   My office cubicle environment doesn't really lent itself to cranking up audio files, but I listened to a bit of it at low volume, and it sounds pretty damn good. A nice funky tune reminiscent of their last album, "Painting it Red."   I also couldn't help noticing that their new female singer is quite the hottie.

       it's crazy, but i'm frightened by the sound of the telephone   Singer Robert Palmer  urlLink died  of a heart attack this morning. He was 54.   I realize that to many people, Palmer's suave, double-breasted suits were the very antithesis of rebellious rock and roll, but back in the day, the man made some great music. His debut album, "Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley," is a masterpiece of New Orleans funk. Some of his more obscure, early songs, including "Pride," "Looking For Clues," "Woke Up Laughing," in addition to his cover of the song that was the inspiration for the title of this blog (you guessed it, "Pressure Drop"), are soulful interpretations by a man who was undoubtedly in love with all kinds of music. Rest in peace, Robert.   I now ask that all the supermodels who strutted their way through the "Addicted to Love" video put down their prop instruments and observe a moment of silence.

       concerts past and future   Last night I saw  urlLink Brad Mehldau  at Scullers with my sister Julie and my friend (and former Borders co-worker) Bob. I've been a Mehldau fan for about two years now, but seeing the man perform live in front of my eyes has given me about 50 times more respect for his talent. Performing with longtime collaborators Larry Grenadier (on bass) and Jorge Rossy (on drums), Brad ripped though a 90-minute set with pure, raw improvisational mastery. I realize it sounds like I just broke out the Concert Reviewing Thesaurus for that last sentence, but man, were these guys good. An epic version (I'd say it was at least 20 minutes) of the standard "Get Happy" was simply jaw-dropping.   I believe Brad's doing a few more nights at Scullers. Try and catch this show. He's incredible.   This morning I ordered tickets to next month's acoustic  urlLink Paul Weller  show at Avalon. This will be my third time seeing "The Modfather" and I sure hope it won't be the last.  As his fellow Brits would say, "he's tops."

       eight simple rules for riding the T   1) Don't bring hot food (burgers, fries, Chinese, etc) on the train. It stinks up the place a lot more than usual. The T ends up smelling like the Corner Mall -- not a good thing.   2) Don't bring a hot beverage on the train during rush hour. I realize that you need your caffeine fix, but nobody is coordinated enough to handle that. Plus, there's always the chance you'll spill it, enraging an already cranky bunch of commuters. Get your coffee at work.   3) If you know that you're going to be on a crowded train, do us all a favor and slap on some anti-perspirant before you leave the house. If you think hot french fries are a stifling odor on the T, try an unwashed, sweaty, overweight passenger. Like my friend Jamie said when he visited me in Naples: "blue cheese is not a deodorant."  4) Let the people out before you get in. It's just like an elevator. Why do so many people find this confusing?  5) Don't spread out across two seats when the train is crowded. I don't care how long your legs are -- it's just plain rude. The same goes for those jerk-offs who put their bag on a separate seat. That's what your lap is for, you ingrate.   6) Don't stand in front of the entrance when other people are getting on or off the train. That little alcove isn't your own personal space, it serves a function: to funnel people on and off. Common sense, people.   7) You know what I hate? People who stand in front of an empty seat. What the hell is that all about? I realize that your manly stamina allows you to stand while lesser men choose to sit, but if there's a seat available, someone out there wants it, and you're blocking it. I'm not impressed, Abs of Steel. Move out of the way.   8) This one is for the conductors. I've got plenty of beefs with you people, but here's a glaring problem I encounter all the time, particularly on the Green Line: TURN DOWN THE DAMN SPEAKERS!! I realize that Copley is the next stop, I don't need to hear it at decibel levels that would overpower a Who concert. "BING! BONG! NEXT STOP COPLEY! THIS IS A 'D' RIVERSIDE TRAIN!!" I get the idea! Dial it down a bit. What, did the MBTA get a special bargain rate on the "Earsplitter" model? Jeez...isn't it enough that you're raising the damn fares in January?

       i'm glad it will rain today   It would be easy to describe  urlLink Elvis Costello's  latest album, "North," as a continuation of "Painted From Memory," his 1998 collaboration with uber-songwriter Burt Bacharach. In fact you could even draw comparisons to his 1993 string quartet-fueled "The Juliet Letters." But the fact is, "North" is a unique entry in the Costello catalog. One that may alienate fans, but still a worthwhile effort that will grow stronger with repeated listens.   That's easy for me to say...I just bought it last night. But initial impressions are strong. The album's potential staying power is aided in large part to the timeless nature of the arrangements. While his work with Bacharach employed ornate, flashy -- shall we say, "Bacharachian" -- arrangements, the sparse yet lyrical use of orchestral instruments on "North" suggests mature classics-in-the-making.  It's a given that people waiting for Elvis' New Wave Angry Young Man persona should sit this one out -- unless they have open minds and are willing to experiment. The fact is, despite Costello's undisputed position as one of the first Thinking Man's Punks, his ability to create works that impress the jazz and classical set is difficult to deny, especially after hearing his latest release (the venerable classical label Deutsche Grammophon was impressed enough to release the album, after all).   While "Painted..." evoked a classic 60s pop sound, "North" is most definitely rooted in jazz, albeit of the torch-song brand. Elvis sings a lot of the songs in a melancholy low register, aided by longtime partner-in-crime Steve Nieve and a host of other musicians, including the Brodsky Quartet (the string ensemble that accompanied him on "The Juliet Letters").  Orchestrations are lush and inventive (arranged and conducted by Elvis himself).   The lyrics are not among Elvis' most imaginative. Long considered one of rock's most inventive, literate writers (and still is, if you've heard last years vitriolic "When I Was Cruel"), the songs here mainly concern love, both gained and lost. The break-up of his 16-year marriage to Cait O'Riordan and his current relationship with jazz singer Diana Krall are reportedly the inspirations behind the words sung here. And while lines like "I've wasn't very conversational / except to say that 'you're sensational'" can make me cringe, overall the lyrical content is pleasant enough. It's the impressive, unique and sophisticated arrangements that stand out on "North."  Piano is the main instrument here (with Nieve's beautiful playing, it's no wonder he's been Costello's right-hand-man for more than 25 years), and there's barely a guitar to be heard (the liner notes say that Elvis plays guitar on "When It Sings," but I'll be damned if I can hear it).   The "bonus disc" is a DVD with Elvis playing three songs at the piano (an old, dirty upright piano in some mock-forest soundstage -- kind of strange, if you ask me). He also discusses the songs a bit before playing them -- two "North" songs in addition to the unreleased title track. In fact, Elvis says (with a mischievous gleam in his eye) that you can find the song if you look around for it. The truth is, you have to download in online. The disc comes with a card that includes a PIN number to get to the track. I have to go along with  urlLink Tom  and say that this is a practice that needs to stop. If it's good enough to be released, put it on the damn album already.   Tom also referred to "North" as "a good 'winter' album," which I feel is an accurate description. I'd also call it a good "rainy" album (the title of this post is one of my favorite lines from the album so far). It's a good album to listen to while walking cold, rainy city streets, thinking about love. A bit corny? Maybe. But it's still beautiful.

       born to eat   Zagat, the folks responsible for those ubiquitous restaurant guides, have taken it upon themselves to release the  urlLink results  of a survey of the top albums of all time. I have no idea why they've chosen to branch out in this manner, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt. In the meantime, I'll good-naturedly pick apart their top ten choices...  1) "Born to Run," Bruce Springsteen: I'm not a Springsteen fan. He just doesn't do anything for me. But I appreciate the fact that a lot of people do and accept the fact that he's very good at what he does. This is supposed to be a good album, and I guess if I was a fan I'd approve.   2) "Abbey Road," The Beatles: Definitely one of their best (although not my personal favorite). Lots of good songs, and the medley on side two is brilliant.   3) "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," The Beatles: I think this album is very accomplished and has some very nice songs, but in the end I find it overrated. Nowadays is sounds a bit quaint and dated.   4) "The Joshua Tree," U2: Not a big U2 fan (but I used to be). There's some good stuff on this album, but they were really at the peak of their self-importance here. Still, I guess I can see why it was so huge.   5) "White Album," The Beatles: Now we're talking. Undoubtedly, hands-down my all-time favorite Beatles album. This is the one that should have gotten all the huzzahs they gave Sgt. Pepper. Dense, intense, adventurous and endlessly creative. Besides the obvious experimentalism (in songs like "Revolution 9" and "Piggies"), there's also lots of very beautiful music ("Mother Nature's Son," "Cry Baby Cry"), lots of kick-ass rockers ("Yer Blues," "Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey") and quite possibly the Beatles' most underrated song (George Harrison's funky "Savoy Truffle").   6) "Kind of Blue," Miles Davis: I was under the impression that they were just rating rock albums, but that's okay. Miles' 1959 classic transcends genres. The album is regularly hailed as a groundbreaking masterpiece and it's easy to see why after only one listen. It's gorgeous stuff (although I prefer "In a Silent Way," if I could only have one Miles Davis disc to listen to).   7) "Darkenss on the Edge of Town," Bruce Springsteen: see #1.   8) "Revolver," The Beatles: There's a lot of people out there who consider this their best album. It certainly broke a lot of ground, and there's several excellent songs on this album, but they would do much better work afterwards.   9) "Dark Side of the Moon," Pink Floyd: This album has suffered what I feel is an unfair backlash. Like most classic rock of the 70s, this album was played to death on the radio and has unfortunately diminished its power. But if you revisit it with fresh ears, you'll notice that it really is an amazing, moody piece of work.   10) "Achtung Baby," U2: Huh? While I find it odd that this album found its way on to the Top Ten, I have to admit that it's my favorite U2 album and blows the prententious "Joshua Tree" out of the water.

       enjoy the view   The name  urlLink Bryan Beller  may not ring a bell with you, unless you're a jazz/rock/fusion fan living in Southern California, or better yet, if you're a fan of the gargantuanly talented  urlLink Mike Keneally.    Bryan has been Mike's bass player on and off for about ten years, which is no easy task. Not that Mike is crankier than Van Morrison on the Atkins Diet -- it's just that Keneally's music is pretty tough to play. Complicated jazz/rock/alternative stuff that veers from the jaw-dropping stylings of Frank Zappa (Mike's former mentor) to the lush power-pop of XTC and Todd Rundgren.   What I'm getting at is that Bryan, stellar musician that he is, is getting ready to release his very-first solo album, entitled "View." If you appreciate challenging music played well with a touch of bizarre humor, you should drop a few bucks on this upcoming release. Bryan's  urlLink site  even has some tasty audio samples.  This is your chance to open your mind to new music, and in the process, support a struggling musician who runs his own label (Onion Boy Records), as opposed to funneling more of your hard-earned cash into the latest MTV Flavor of the Month.

       As God is my witness, i thought turkeys could fly   He was most recently known as the latest Maytag Repairman, but to me, Gordon Jump will always be the bumbling station manager on the hugely underrated 70s sitcom "WKRP in Cincinnati" (where he was responsible for the seminal quote that serves as the title of this post). Gordon  urlLink died  yesterday at age 71. He also played Mr. Thomassoulo, George's boss at "Play Now," on a couple of "Seinfeld" episodes. Rest in peace, Gordon.

       the latest controversy   I rarely edit posts after they've been published, unless it's to clear up a spelling or grammatical error that I notice after the fact. But a post from this morning about certain opinons I have toward Elvis Presley have caused me to rethink a couple of things. Mainly, I wanted to change the title of the post, "Chuck D was right." I was referring to the Public Enemy song "Fight the Power," which calls Elvis a racist.   I don't know of any substantial proof that Elvis was a racist. There was an alleged quote from Elvis that made the rounds years ago, something to the effect of African Americans only being good for "shining my shoes and buying my records," but as far as I'm concerned that's an urban legend.   I decided to replace the title with a line from a Living Colour song that gets to the heart of what I was trying to say. Elvis was in fact a deeply talented artist. People who like his music are by no means racist simply by virtue of their musical taste. I just feel that labelling the man "the king of rock and roll" is grossly inaccurate when you consider how many great artists were writing and performing rock and roll before him.   That's all I wanted to say. I guess this is why I hesitated for so long about adding a comments section.

       two movies i saw over the weekend    urlLink "American Splendor."  If Paul Giamatti isn't nominated for an Oscar, my faith in the human race will futher dwindle. Paul plays Harvey Pekar, a file clerk whose main obsessions are jazz and comic books. In the 1970s he meets comic artist R. Crumb and together they create "American Splendor," a comic book about Harvey's dull existence.   Pekar himself narrates the film and appears every so often in surreal interview segments. The film give non-comic book enthusiasts (like myself) a new appreciation for the genre. Harvey's rumpled, no-nonsense persona gets him an occasional gig on David Letterman's show, but once he's sick of being the source of Dave's bemusement, Harvey appears on the show for the last time and berates the host and audience in what will be his final appearance.   Never have I seen a film that has made an ordinary guy so winning and engaging. Although Harvey is not much of a sentimental guy, and he warns us early on that this isn't some sappy Hollywood story, He does in fact come off as an old softie on occasion.   A unique move about a unique guy.    urlLink "Anything Else."  This latest Woody Allen movie is being heralded by some critics as a return to form after several mediocre disappointments ("Curse of the Jade Scorpion," "Hollywood Ending"). Here, Woody goes back to what he does best: romantic comedy with typical barbs about life in New York and being Jewish.   Jason Biggs plays a comedy writer whose relationship with his girlfriend (Christina Ricci) is complicated by the fact that she has trouble committing and is a bundle of vices. Does this sound like classic Woody yet? Of course it does. Woody himself plays Jason's paranoid mentor, Stockard Channing is brilliant as Ricci's overdramatic mother (playing what Woody fans might call "the Dianne Weist role"), Danny Devito is Biggs' incompetent manager, and Jimmy Fallon even gets in on the act as Biggs' best friend who introduces the Ricci character.   There's a lot of the Woody Allen standbys here: trips to the shrink, the lead character ranting on to the camera, and of course, those comforting white-on-black title cards with the big band music in the background. This isn't anything that would take "Hannah and Her Sisters," "Annie Hall" or "Crimes and Misdemeanors" off my list of favorite Woody Allen movies, but it's a fun treat and a nice return to form.

       is he for real?   Check out  urlLink  Cranky Reviewer.  He's one of a zillion Amazon.com reviewers (I'm one too, but haven't really done many reviews there since I started this blog) and has a rather, shall we say unusual taste in music. He hates people like Bob Dylan, the Beatles, White Stripes, Stanley Kubrick, both Elvises (Presley and Costello), Rolling Stones, Talking Heads but can't stop raving about the genius of Justin Timberlake and other teen-popsters. He even goes out of his way to praise bands that normally get slagged by the press (he calls Oasis "better than the Beatles"). I get the feeling this is an elaborate "irony is cool"" joke. What do you think?

       a black man taught him how to sing, and then they crowned him king   Some people have been a bit on the peeved side regarding my comments about Elvis Presley. While I dont despise the man, and will admit that he released some fine recordings and was an excellent, unique singer, my main beef with the guy is the fact that he was (and still is) called the King of Rock and Roll. Now listen closely, Elvis fans, because this is where youll begin your long, bitter hatred and resentment toward me.  I believe it is racist to call Elvis Presley the King of Rock and Roll.   Why? Thats an easy one. Long before Elvis came along, there was rock and roll, and it was being performed by some pretty talented people. Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, Fats Domino, and -- perhaps the most underrated and overly screwed-over figure in music history -- Bo Diddley. Those are just a few of Elvis predecessors. But along came Presley, white as a loaf of Wonder Bread, and now society can put an acceptable Caucasian face on rock and roll. We cant call a colored person the King of anything, now can we? Well heres a white man who can sing that crazy rhythm music just fine. So here you go, Elvis! Youre the King!

       thoughts on both elvises   Don't forget to buy Elvis Costello's new album, "North," which hits stores tomorrow. Did I make myself clear? No? Well, then...   urlLink     And now on to Old, Fat, Dead Elvis. I've never been much of an Elvis Presley fan, but if people are going to reissue and remix his music, why do they have to choose crap like "Rubberneckin'?" If I see that Toyota commercial one more time, I'm going to do my best impersonation of the Jumpsuited One and blow a hole through my Samsung 21-inch. If I had a gun, that is.   Oh, and if it's true that there really are two kinds of people -- Elvis People and Beatles People -- than I am unequivocally a Beatles Person. The Beatles wrote their own songs and played their own instruments. Period. That's all you need to know.

       it's a marvelous night for a lawsuit   Alex Beam has a great  urlLink article  in today's Boston Globe about Van Morrison trying to prevent an unauthorized biography of the cranky singer/songwriter from being published.   The book, entitled "Can You Feel the Silence," apparently paints Van the Man in a rather unflattering light. Now I've been a Van Morrison fan since way back when (1990, to be exact), and while I will be the first to admit that he's one of rock's most talented, accomplished and enduring figures, you have to admit -- he's not exactly known for being warm and cuddly.   If this book ever seees the light of day, you can bet I'll be checking it out. I'm all about rock star dirt. (Boston-area fans, take note: there's apparently a section in the book about Van's brief period as a resident of Cambridge in the late sixties).

       my weekend at the movies   I didnt exactly spend the  entire  weekend in a movie theater, but it certainly felt like it. And thats good. Just as I planned it, I attended three movies this weekend, and guess what? They were all great. That doesnt happen too often, now does it?  I decided that one of the things I can do to stay busy, entertained, and relatively happy while Liza is in Europe for three months is go to the movies a lot. Im thinking about maybe at least one movie every weekend, which is quite do-able, as long as I dont raid the concession stand every time (Im proud to say that I didnt give the overpriced snack counters an ounce of my business during any of my three trips to the theater this weekend  I love noshing at the movies, but the trick is to eat a meal beforehand; it seems to work).   Before I go into any reviews of this weekends films, how about some movie theater observations that Ive been dying to get off my chest? Ill try to keep it brief.   First of all  why the hell cant people figure out how to get to the movie on time? You know when the movie is playing; you presumably know how to get to the theater; so do us all a favor and show up on time. When Im in the theater, I want zero distractions. None at all. So get in your seat before showtime and shut the hell up, okay? Thanks.   Speaking of shutting up  the unwritten rule during a movie is NO TALKING. I rarely use all caps, so you know I mean business here. Shut up. I didnt pay $8.75 to listen to your inane observations. And if your attention deficit disorder-addled date cant follow the plot,  whisper  in his/her ear. Talking in full voice during a movie should be punishable with possible jail time, as far as Im concerned.   Okay, when did they start showing commercials in the theater? Im not talking about previews  I enjoy those  Im talking about commercials for cars, soda, whatever. File that one under the I-didnt-pay-$8.75-for rant. And lets not even go into the insipid Coca Cola Football Town commercial thats being shown   ad nauseum . Although I admit that I really love the Inconsiderate Cell Phone Man spot (Its pronounced Kara-TAY). I wont get into cell phone rudeness in the theaters because I rarely, if at all, encounter anyone idiotic enough to actually leave their phone on in the theater (although Im sure it happens). And what about these Fandango ads? Does anyone use this Fandango thing? I dont know a single person who does, but I sure know a lot of people whove seen the ads.   Wow, that was cathartic.   Friday night: Lost in Translation  Jumpin Jesus on a pogo stick, you have to see this movie. Sofia Coppola, who directed 2000s Virgin Suicides, does the complete opposite of the sophomore slump  she makes a film more brilliant, mature and insightful than her already-impressive debut. Bill Murray plays an American actor in Japan to shoot a whiskey commercial. In his bored stupor he meets a fellow American, played by Scarlet Johanssen (whose mussed, thrift-store looks are ten times sexier than any of the standard Cameron Diaz bimbos, if you ask me), whos accompanying her husband (Giovanni Ribisi), a rock photographer whos always off on shoots and doesnt seem to care much that his relatively new bride is bored stiff in the hotel.   Murray and Johanssen strike up an unusual friendship and spend most of their time wandering around the gaudy, neon-lit streets of Tokyo. The music, the cinematopgraphy, and the understated acting all make this a total pleasure to watch. See it.   Saturday: Le Divorce  Despite the mixed reviews, Ive wanted to see this movie for some time. I enjoy the films of Merchant/Ivory, and although they normally specialize in period pieces, their forays into the modern world are often just as entertaining. This one caught my attention especially for its subject matter: Americans in Paris. Paris in general has always been a soft spot for me, whether its music, art, film, literature  living there for five years as a child had an effect on me that that remains to this day.   Kate Hudson  in a surprisingly low-key role  plays an American woman visiting her sister in Paris. Her sister  played by Naomi Watts  is married to a Frenchman. They have one daughter and are expecting a second child. Hudson arrives at her sisters apartment just as her brother-in-law is walking out the door, presumably forever. This sets up an often amusing, occasionally sweet, and sometimes brutally serious story about divorce, and how American and French cultures react differently to myriad social situations.   Watts in-laws  a tight-lipped, rich, influential lot  obviously side with the husband, and they seem to be more concerned about how the property will be divided up than how this will affect the husband, wife, child, and expected child emotionally. A painting that Watts brought with her to France when she first arrived in the country is quite possibly worth a great deal of money, and the two families fight bitterly about its worth and ownership. Watts family visits from the States to help clear up some of the squabbles. Her parents (played expertly by Sam Waterston and Stockard Channing) want whats best for their daughter, while her brother is the typical Ugly American and is concerned about the painting and little else. Stephen Fry has a hilarious scene as an appraiser from Christies who meets the American family for lunch to discuss the paintings worth.   The movie is fun, beautifully shot and paints Paris in a gorgeous light, despite the fact that it shows its people to be rather callous. The film is a bit schizophrenic, however; it occasionally cant decide whether its a social farce, a mystery or straight drama. And the whole subplot with Matthew Modine as a jealous American whose wife is cheating on him with Watts husband was ridiculous. It ruined the flow of the film and was pretty far-fetched. Overall, though  I recommend it.   Sunday: Dirty Pretty Things  Stephen Frears is nothing if not eclectic. Hes directed slices of urban England (Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, My Beautiful Launderette), con artist yarns (The Grifters), period pieces (Mary Reilly) and one hilarious adaptation of a book about record store employees (High Fidelity). His latest film is billed as a thriller, but its really more along the lines of a social drama with occasional thriller overtones.   In the film, Chiwotel Ejiofor plays a Nigerian illegal immigrant named Okwe who works as a cab driver by day and a hotel concierge by night. A fellow hotel employee, Senay (played by Audrey Tautou of Amelie) is Turkish and is allowed to live in England for the time being while her immigration status is under review. In any case, she cant take employment or rent out her apartment until her status is approved. So what does she do? Gets a job  and  lets Okwe crash on her couch. Needless to say, these two have a lot to fear. Deportation, jail time  you name it.   Okwe discovers that the sleazy hotel manager is involved in an organ donation scheme that allows illegals to obtain passports as long as theyre willing to give up a kidney. Okwe's skills as a doctor in his native country give the manager an excuse to cut him in on the operation. Okwe is torn between his values, helping is friend Senay, and maybe getting legal status too, while hes at it.   What follows is a gritty look at underworld London. Sweatshops, hookers, morgues and illegal, botched operations are all part of the fabric of this truly original film. Tautou, who I adored in Amelie but was afraid would seem inauthentic in this role, totally blew away my misconceptions. She pulls off the impressive trick of being a French actress speaking English with a Turkish accent. Shes amazing. Ejiofor is also brilliant. A British born-and-raised actor who apparently learned the accent from his African-born parents, hes completely believable. The film is a tough, uncompromising look at an unforgiving world where nothing is easy.

       welcome to another installment of "facial hair today"   Is it just me, or are beards the new thing for indie guys? I can't help noticing that a growing number of my indie/punk friends are embracing the Grizzly Adams look. Is  urlLink Rivers Cuomo  to blame for this?   It's obvious that goatees haven't been remotely indie for years (professional baseball players seemed to have co-opted that look). First it was mutton chops, and now beards. Perhaps goatees (a trend I'm glad to see go away, to be honest) were too much trouble to maintain for today's slacker indie. With a beard, you don't have to do a thing. Just let it grow.

       and while we're on the subject of movies...   What with  urlLink Liza's  sojourn in Holland making me lonelier and more bummed out than I thought possible, plus  urlLink Johnny Cash  and  urlLink Warren Zevon  dying in the space of one week, I could use some escape. So I think I'm going to the movies this weekend. A few of them, if possible.   Right now there's several films out there that I'm curious to see. I'd love to catch  urlLink "Le Divorce"  -- it was directed by James Ivory, has a great cast (Sam Waterston!) and let's face it, I'm a sucker for anything that takes place in France.    urlLink "Dirty Pretty Things"  looks pretty good, too. It was directed by Stephen Frears ("High Fidelity," "The Grifters") and stars Audrey Tatou, who was so engaging, and -- let's face it -- so damn cute in "Amelie."  Finally,   urlLink "Lost in Translation"  is another one on the list of gotta-sees. Sophia Coppola's previous directorial effort, "The Virgin Suicides," was beautiful (and more than a little creepy), and I love it when Bill Murray plays non-Bill Murray parts in indie-type films (he was brilliant as Herman Blume in "Rushmore").   Three movies in one weekend? I can do that.

I might actually have to see this.

       warren zevon: making sense of the catalog   Checking out amazon.com this morning, I couldn't help noticing (quite happily, I might add) that not only is Warren Zevon's last, almost-posthumous album "The Wind" the number-one seller on their site, but most of the rest of his releases are scattered liberally throughout the chart (including two more titles in the top ten alone). This is a bittersweet victory for Warren's legacy. While it's great to see the attention his music has been getting since he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, it's a shame he's not here to see it happen.   Since I'm willing to bet a good deal of these Amazon customers are plowing through Warren's catalog without a strong sense of what they're looking for, I'm only too happy to provide an unoffical guide to these amazing albums. Warren Zevon made lots of great music. Here's a breakdown (note: these are my opinions. If you disagree, my apologies):  "Wanted Dead or Alive" (1969) -- I'm no expert on this album since, well, I've never heard it. But by most accounts, it's an amateurish effort for completists only. Warren released this album in 1969 and after it bombed, he wrote jingles, traveled around Europe, and toured with the Everly Brothers until meeting Jackson Browne, who produced his follow-up, the cleverly titled...  "Warren Zevon" (1976) -- This is where it gets good. A beautifully produced album and a launching pad for a brilliant career. Some of Warren's best songs can be found here: "Poor Poor Pitiful Me," "Mohammed's Radio," "The French Inhaler," "Carmelita" and the gorgeous "Desperados Under the Eaves," which   urlLink Palmermix  called "perhaps the best song I know of about living in Los Angeles."  "Excitable Boy" (1978) -- A brilliant follow-up and one of my personal favorites. In my opinion, there isn't a single weak track on the album (not even "Night Time in the Switching Yard" -- its dated disco-funk sound is a fun listen). Warren's "hits" can be found here ("Werewolves of London," "Excitable Boy," "Lawyers, Guns and Money") along with some classic ballads ("Accidentally Like a Martyr") and mid-tempo stompers ("Johnny Strikes Up the Band"). Essential stuff.   "Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School" (1980) -- Despite the ambitious experimentalism (the string quartet interludes), Warren was slipping a bit here. There are definitely some strong numbers here (like the riff-heavy title track, "Play it all Night Long," the jubilant cover of "A Certain Girl" and the dense, violent "Jungle Work"), but there's also a lot of filler. If you become a huge fan after getting some more vital releases, check this one out. But it's not a good first choice.   "Stand in the Fire" (1981) -- This album has never been released on CD, but I hear rumors that Rhino is planning to put it out next year. If so, do yourself a favor and grab it. This incendiary live album features Warren tearing up the Roxy with a band of young, hungry unknowns. The live version of "Mohammed's Radio" is far superior to the tamer original, and Warren's penchant for changing lyrics around is used to hilarious effect throughout the album. Absolutely insane live work and one of the finest live albums I've ever heard.   "The Envoy" (1982) -- Another one that's not out on CD -- yet. A bit uneven, like "Bad Luck Streak...", and the presence of cheesy keyboards is a bit of a distraction. There are some nice, sweet tunes here ("The Hula Hula Boys," "Looking For the Next Best Thing"), in addition to some heavy rockers ("The Overdraft," the hilarious "Ain't That Pretty at All"), but overall, this one can wait until you have most of the others.  "A Quiet Normal Life: the Best of WZ" (1986) --  Avoid this one. Seriously. First of all, it was released in the mid-eighties when CD mastering was still sketchy, and song selection -- in my opinion -- leaves a lot to be desired. There are two other far superior compilations out there, and we'll get to them in a minute.   "Sentimental Hygiene" (1987) -- Zevon returns from a self-imposed exile (where he quit drinking and got his shit together) with this strong album. One of his best and definitely his best of the eighties. Bill Berry, Peter Buck and Mike Mills (three-quarters of REM) are his backing band for most of the tracks, and they sound terrific. Lots of great, great songs ("Detox Mansion," "Boom Boom Mancini," "Even a Dog Can Shake Hands," "The Factory") and tons of guests (Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Michael Stipe, Flea). The only less-than excellent parts are a couple of ballads that don't really do anything for me and an ill-advised collaboration with the otherwise great George Clinton (on the horribly dated "Leave My Monkey Alone"). Overall, an outstanding album.   "Transverse City" (1989) -- This "cyberpunk" concept album suffers from too many overbearing keyboards, but the more organic tracks ("Splendid Isolation," "Turbulence," "Gridlock") are excellent. A mixed bag.   "Hindu Love Gods" (1990) -- Unreleased jamming from the "Sentimental Hygiene" sessions (featuring Zevon, Buck, Mills and Berry). A rough, crazy mess and lots of fun to listen to. Mostly blues covers, but does contain a great garage band version of Prince's "Raspberry Beret."   "Mr. Bad Example" (1991) -- Warren is still suffering from keyboard overdose at this point, but the songs are the saving grace here, from the brutal "Finishing Touches" to the tender "Suzie Lightning" and the hilarious "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead." The title track is a scream.   "Learning to Flinch" (1993) -- An excellent acoustic "unplugged" live album (featuring Warren on piano and acoustic guitar). Lots of great classic songs are given new life, and some of them actually sound better (the solo piano version of "The French Inhaler"  blows away the original). The crowds are fun and appreciative, egging Warren on to some inspired performances (especially on the manic, almost psychotic version of "Poor Poor Pitiful Me").   "Mutineer" (1995) -- A commercial bomb, this album features Warren on most of the instruments, recorded at his home studio (with occasional help from guests like David Lindley and Bruce Hornsby). The songs have a "demo" quality to them, and are mostly very good (like "Rottweiler Blues," "The Indifference of Heaven" and the moving title track). But there's also a bit of filler. Above average.   "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" (1996) -- If you're going to get an anthology and you're not on a budget, get this one. Two discs packed with the essential stuff, plus lots of TV and film soundtrack stuff not available anywhere else, and a booklet stuffed with photos and song-by-song commentary from the man himself. If you're going to get only one thing by Warren (but don't!), get this.   "Life'll Kill Ya" (2000) -- Warren returns after five years with this strong album. A sparsely arranged masterpiece. Most of the songs are amazing ("I Was In the House When the House Burned Down," "For My Next Trick I'll Need a Volunteer," "Don't Let Us Get Sick") with minimal filler. Get this. Now.   "My Ride's Here" (2002) -- Another mixed bag. Some good rockers ("Sacrifical Lambs," the hilarious "Hit Somebody") but some so-so tracks as well.   "Genius" (2002) -- If you don't want to go all out for the two-disc anthology, this is an excellent single-disc retrospective. Twenty-two tracks, and maybe two of them I'm not crazy about. Great stuff.   "The Wind" (2003) -- Warren's health is a bit fragile at this point, but he comes through. The album is a bit ballad-heavy, but the songs are great. The fiery "Disorder in the House," the piano-driven "Numb as a Statue" and the touching closer "Keep Me In Your Heart" are all terrific. Get this not just for the great songs and performances, but as a fitting swan song for a man whose career was filled with wonderful moments.

       crappy reporting can make you rich   Let me see if I've got this straight: Jayson Blair, a New York Times reporter who was fired for shoddy reporting, constantly missing deadlines, and even outright fabrication and plaigarism, has  urlLink signed a book deal?  With an advance "well into six figures?"  In annoys me beyond belief that this moron is being rewarded for all of this. I'm not one to organize boycotts, but by all means, stay away from this book. This guy doesn't deserve your hard-earned cash.

       mariska hargitay in the mosh pit   USA Network has a new promo for their  urlLink weeknight "Law & Order: SVU" reruns,  and it uses the song "Police on my Back" by the Clash. Now my feelings about rock songs being sold for TV commercials are mixed at best, but hey...I love the Clash and I love SVU. So what's the problem?

       a new commercial that i already hate   You may have seen it. It's for this new type of butter spread by "Country Crock" that apparently contains...are you ready...yogurt. Now, my feelings about putting yogurt in your butter aren't really the issue here. It's pretty gross, but hey, to each his own. The commercial itself is really what makes me retch.  In the commercial, this yuppie stud is doing sit-ups in his yuppie apartment, while yuppie wife is holding down his feet for greater sit-up capability. As he starts to feel the pressure and slow down, the significant other taunts him by saying something like, "now now, don't stop just yet...just think about your REWARD." At this point she waves a piece of bread in his face, slathered with the yogurt/butter mixture.   Okay, first of all, I know it's been a while since I've done sit-ups, but I wouldn't appreciate someone waving food at me while I'm in that much pain. Also, when I'm doing that kind of physical activity, I'm not thinking about bread, or butter, or yogurt. I'm thirsty. You want to reward me? Get me a Powerade or something.   And I'm not even going to attempt any comment about the amount of spread they dolloped onto this piece of bread. "Yeah honey, after my intense workout I'm going to get back to the business of hardening my arteries with this butter/curdled milk grout. Thanks!"

       now he can sleep   Warren Zevon, mercenary rock and roller, the one of music's most erudite, underappreciated and twisted talents,  urlLink succumbed  to the cancer he was diagnosed with more than a year ago.   There was really nobody quite like him. Everyone from Jill Sobule to Billy Bob Thornton to Dwight Yoakam to REM to Bob Dylan sang his praises. Folks, if Bob Frickin' Dylan thinks you're a great songwriter, you must be doing something right.   Rest in peace, Warren. God knows you've earned it.

       music related memories: 1988   I dont know if this is going to work or not, but this is my attempt to show how music has always been a part of my life, year by year. Im choosing 1988 as a starting point because it was the first full year that I was living as an adult and as a result my own music was probably more present than ever. I will jump around from year to year as this project progresses (if it progresses at all). For the record, I spent October 1987 to August 1988 at the Defense Information School in Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana (where I was training to be a navy broadcast journalist) and in September 1988 I began a two-year tour at the Navy Broadcasting Service detachment in Diego Garcia, a small island in the middle of the Indian Ocean thats actually owned by the United Kingdom.   January: Listening to my new cassette copy of the Elvis Costello b-sides collection Out of Our Idiot in my dorm room while the Indianapolis deep-freeze raged on outside.  February: Buying a used cassette copy of Concerts for Kampuchea in a nasty little used store in Broad Ripple with my girlfriend, then listening in horror while it squealed away noisily in her cars tape deck. Dont buy used cassettes.   March: Going totally apeshit when Public Image Limited broke into the Sex Pistols Holiday in the Sun at their Market Square Arena concert (opening for INXS).  April: Realizing how beautiful the orchestral tracks on Erasures Two Ring Circus album sound.   May: Being informed by a bemused Lieutenant Gordon Cole that I would be authorized to do a no-rules punk/new-wave program for my final SITE radio show class just so he could get an idea of what exactly this crazy music was that I listened to so much.   June: Listening to Morrisseys Viva Hate and Thomas Dolbys Aliens Ate My Buick over and over and over.   July: Docked points on my pop/rock radio show by choosing The Purple Lagoon by Frank Zappa as my instrumental outro music. Petty Officer Vince Vidal informed me that the selection is more appropriate for a jazz show.   August: Buying the sampler cassette of Frank Zappas You Cant Do That On Stage Anymore box set and listening to it with unabashed glee in the tape deck of Ron Pooles car as we were driving back from the mall.   September: Listening to Elvis Costellos Trust album on my Walkman and chain-smoking Marlboro Lights on the final, dead-of-night leg of my marathon plane ride from Philadelphia to Diego Garcia.   October: Listening to the sadly out-of-print Urgh! A Music War soundtrack in my barracks room with roommate Bob Shunk.  November: Receiving the first of many cassettes from my sister of random WFNX broadcasts, back when it was an interesting, innovative radio station with little regard for playlists. I first heard the Pixies (Where Is My Mind), They Might Be Giants (Purple Toupee) and John Wesley Harding (The Devil In Me) through these tapes.   December: Obsessing over the cassette my brother mailed me, with Living Colours Vivid on one side and Fishbones Truth and Soul on the other.

       i am a paul weller fan and i am happy   Two great pieces of news regarding the great  urlLink Paul Weller:  I found out this morning that he's doing a US acoustic tour next month and will be coming to Boston on October 24. Will I be there? Holy crap, what do you think? Of course I will. With bells on, whatever that means. Good Weller News Part Two: I found out that Newbury Comics has two copies of  urlLink "Fly on the Wall,"  his brand-new b-sides/rarities box set that I can't seem to find anywhere else. They're holding a copy for me and I'm picking it up tomorrow afternoon.   I believe "yay" is the operative word here. Or, since it's Weller, perhaps "Oi!"

       today's random rant   Is there any way that convenience stores can create a separate check-out line for people buying those goddamn scratch cards? I'm in line trying to buy milk, bread -- you know, required sustenance -- and I've got three pinheads in front of me buying fifteen different scratch cards. This pisses me off to no end.

       here's something i can do this fall while liza is away   Lots of good DVD coming out in the next couple of months, according to the folks at  urlLink DVD Journal.  A "special edition" of "Fargo" (long overdue, the original release's features are pretty lame), "The Kids are Alright," the fourth season of "The Sopranos" and more  urlLink Criterion  discs than you can shake a stick at.   Also, I had no idea that  urlLink "Backbeat"  has been available on DVD for almost a month now. If you've never heard of that film, you're not alone -- it died at the box office, which is a crying shame. If you're a Beatles fan (sorry  urlLink Heather ) you owe it to yourself to check out this immensely watchable biopic of the Beatles' early years in Hamburg. It actually concentrates on the relationship between John Lennon, early Beatle Stu Sutcliffe, and Stu's German girlfriend Astrid. It's a fascinating story, and Stephen Dorff is brilliant as the tortured, charismatic Stu. Dorff was touted as the Next Big Thing in the mid-nineties, but apparently it wasn't in the cards. Too bad, he's quite good. The soundtrack is also an interesting facet of the film -- instead of actual Beatles performances (of their early "covers" days, before they were cranking out their own songs), the film uses the sounds of a "supergroup" consisting of Mike Mills (REM), Greg Dulli (Afghan Whigs), Dave Pirner (Soul Asylum), Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters) and Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth). Not exactly the Fab Four, but a damn good facsimile.

       i cannot prove that i exist   It's true, I can't. One of my worst traits as a human being is that I proscrastinate. A lot. I'm also pretty lazy. As a result, I have no valid identification. I often let my various forms of ID lapse and don't bother to renew them until it's too late. Is it difficult to function in society like this? You bet it is.   For the record, this is what I currently have for identification:  An out-of-state (Virginia) drivers license that expired in March 1999. A passport that expired in February 2001. A military dependent ID card that expired in March 1999.  A photo ID from my place of employment that doesn't really get me anywhere but my office.   And that's about it. In March 1999, just before my Virginia license expired, I went to the Boston DMV to get a new Massachusetts license. I waited patiently in the never-ending line, filled out the necessary forms, even smiled for the camera as they were seconds away from taking my photo when the clerk noticed a red flag. Only two words were necessary for them to utter before I realized the hold-up:  North Carolina.  You see, it's not just my procrastination that's to blame for my lack of identity. The state of North Carolina should shoulder some responsibility for this as well. In the fall of 1994, when I was living in Virginia Beach, my (now ex-) wife and I took a leisurely drive through parts of North Carolina. Maybe it was the feel of that 1994 Hyundai under my control, or perhaps a particularly bracing mix tape in the deck, but the next thing you know there's flashing lights over my shoulder, then a no-nonsense state trooper in the driver's side window is informing me that I was doing 86 in a 55. 86, for the record, is considered reckless driving.   After a particularly ridiculous court appearance the following month (in a courthouse that makes "Deliverance" look like a Woody Allen movie), I was fined $100 and not allowed to drive in North Carolina for one year. Fine.   Fast-forward back to 1999, Keep in mind, this is a good three-and-a-half years after my driving privileges have been reinstated (in a state nowhere near Massachusetts). But for some reason, the Massachusetts DMV wants proof that I can still drive down there. They won't budge on my new license until this mystery is solved. So I get in touch with the folks in North Carolina, they send me the appropriate paperwork, but by this time I'm getting ready to move into a new apartment, there's lots of new job issues, etc etc etc, long story short: procrastination sets in once again.   I attempted to get a license again about a year ago. By this time I've let it lapse to the point where I have to take a written exam. I studied like crazy for this thing and finally schlep all the way out to the only DMV office open on weekends that's within access of public transportation (in Watertown). I have my study guide and all the appropriate proof of identification, but by the time I get through the line, I'm informed by the extremely rude and unhelpful clerk that I do not in fact have the correct forms. All the cliches you hear about rude DMV employees are 100 percent accurate, folks. I was practically looking around for Patty and Selma from the Simpsons to creep out of the woodwork.  You see, that's the problem. Yes, I'm a procrastinator. Yes, my dependence on public transportation (irony, anyone?) makes getting this damn thing such a hassle. But every time I manage to make it to the DMV, one more thing goes wrong and my efforts are shattered.   This time, I'm going to make it easier. I'm just getting a Massachusetts ID (no license). I'm not going to be driving anytime soon and the standard ID is much easier to obtain (no test, less paperwork, considerably cheaper). All I have to do now is find my social security card (I think it's still around here somewhere) and get the ball rolling once again.   Although I have to admit it's kind of interesting not having any valid identification. It's like I'm the center of some twisted psychological thriller. "This is Chris Ingalls. He has no identity."

       whinings of a music snob   The last eighteen hours have been a whirlwind of emotions for me, regarding a band I've just sort of discovered. Well, except for those seven hours when I was sleeping.   A few days ago, I became the proud owner of a promo copy of "Welcome Interstate Managers," the latest album by  urlLink Fountains of Wayne  (thank you, part-time Borders job!). I finally got around to listening to it on my Walkman during my circuitous but well-worth-it trip to Porter Square on my way home from work in order to get a super carnitas burrito with chips and salsa from Anna's Taqueria (I also listened to Peter Gabriel's vastly-underrated second album, another shining example of why psychotic, early Gabriel is so much more appetizing to me than latter-day, World Music Gabriel).   Where was I? Oh, yeah. Fountains of Wayne. So anyway, I've heard so much about this band over the years, but have never really listened to them. "Welcome Interstate Managers" was a revelation to me when I first popped it in last night. It's as if you put Elvis Costello, Squeeze, the Beatles, the Cars, Brian Wilson, Weezer and the Monkees in a blender and hit "puree." Gleaming, 24-karat power-pop with great lyrics and sumptuous hooks.   I especially love "Bright Future in Sales," about a guy who gets drunk at office parties but really needs to "get his shit together," as the chorus proclaims, in order to succeed in the workplace. I love songs about mundane office jobs! Really.   But here's the problem. After perusing FOW's website this morning, I was horrified to discover that the band is poised to be "big pop stars!" To wit: "Stacy's Mom" is #1 on VH1's Top Twenty Video Countdown (for the second week in a row); the song is also being added to numerous "hit" radio stations, like Z-100; you can vote for the song on TRL; it's listed in a "Teen People" poll; it's a "buzzworthy" track on MTV and MTV2; and the most horrifying fact of all -- the song is featured in the latest "Now!" compilation. I don't listen to the radio or watch MTV (because, after all, I am a music fan), so I was unaware of all this "buzz." HELP! I like these guys! Don't do this to me!  I pride myself on an eclectic taste in music, in addition to discovering music not through MTV "buzzworthy" status or appearances in People magazine or TRL. If I hear something and I like it, I'll buy it. Additionally, if something becomes deathly popular, I'm almost automatically repelled by it. I don't want to be one of these automatons who buys into corporate hype. I see enough of those people in the store. I like having my own personal playlist or top twenty.   Frank Zappa put it best when he put popularity and chart success in personal perspective in relation to his own works: "As far as I'm concerned, they're all hits. Every one of them. Even 'Dwarf Nebula Processional March.'"  In the meantime, I'm going to continually love Fountains of Wayne. But if anyone asks, I've never seen the video for "Stacy's Mom."

       impending death, come on down!   You know it's sad when I don't know the name of the "Price is Right" announcer who  urlLink just died , even though he's been doing the announcing for almost 20 years, because the "Price is Right" announcer I happen to remember is Johnny Olsen. Johnny did the honors up until the early eighties, and I went through a brief TPIR phase in the summer of 1980 (and maybe 1981, too). Summertime. Lazy pre-teen Chris. Nice day? Who cares, I'm lazing in my pyjamas and I've got the Showcase Showdown right in front of me.   Ah, childhood.   Actually, I should say that I have in fact seen Rod Roddy as impersonated by the people on "Mad TV," a show I've ignored for years but am learning to love. The skit where Roddy was on a date with his wife had me in tears. I haven't laughed that hard since the first time I saw "The Big Lebowski."

       that's entertainment: paul weller at avalon   Last Friday was the third time Id seen Paul Weller in concert. The first time was a thrilling acoustic solo show at the Berklee Performance Center that effectively showcased just how brilliant this man is as a singer, guitarist and songwriter. In February of this year, I saw him with a full band at the Orpheum Theater in a show that was, no exaggeration, one of the finest concerts Ive ever witnessed firsthand. So for this third concert, my expectations were understandably high.   This was again an acoustic show, but Weller was joined this time by a second guitarist, Gem Archer (the latest rhythm guitarist to pass through the revolving door that is Oasis). Its still unclear to me what exactly Paul was promoting on this short US tour. In his native England, Paul tours simply because theres air to breathe. Hes such a huge icon over in Europe that he doesnt need a reason to tour. Unfortunately its a different story in the states. Ill spare you my usual rant about how Paul gets no respect on these shores. But on the somewhat rare occasion that he makes it over here, its usually under the auspices of a new album to promote. This time around, my guess is that hes hawking his excellent new box set, Fly on the Wall, a three-disc collection of b-sides and rarities (still only available as an import here, although his US distributor, Yep Roc, insists that will change soon enough).   While I doubted that his February performance at the Orpheum could ever be topped, I was excited about the prospect of seeing Paul in a club close-up. My friend Bob and his friend Dave met me outside the Avalon just before seven and we promptly found our place to the right of the stage, right by the bar (a location I would soon take full advantage of by drinking copious amounts of beer).   The opening actGod, I hate support acts. I understand that theyre struggling musicians trying to land a big break, butoh hell, never mind. I love them. Whatever. Anywaythis one was actually pretty good. Chris Stills, yep, you guessed itthe son of Stephen Stills. Im not really much of a fan of dear old dad, but this guy was actually quite good. He sounded a lot like Jeff Buckley, playing an acoustic guitar for all songs, except for one song when he sat at the piano (and sounded damn good). Bob, Dave and I spent part of this set wondering who Chris mother was and figured that if Stephen Stills was his father, it could have been anyone (although Joni Mitchell was a reasonable guess).  During the break, I checked out the merch booth, and spoke very briefly with a woman I believed to be Pauls sister, Nicky. I know that Nicky runs her brothers website and also deals with merch, and she had a British accent. But I didnt want to say something stupid like, are you Pauls sister because Im sure she gets that all the time. I mentioned the fact that I blew a load of money on the last Weller show (t-shirt, program, key chain for Liza) and that I would just be getting a pin this time. And I did! A cute little Style Council pin that says Our Favourite Shop is now proudly affixed to my man-bag.   Paul hit the stage soon afterwards and tore into a lovely b-side called The Loved,  followed by the title track to his album Illumination. Gem then joined him, and they played a variety of songs, new (Going Places) and old (Amongst Butterflies), in addition to a smattering of Jam songs that had the crowd roaring (English Rose, Tales from the Riverbank, Thats Entertainment, Town Called Malice). I seem to remember shouting out for Friday Street a few times myself, which may have been the beer talking. A Style Council song (Headstart for Happiness) even made an appearance. Paul even stepped up to the piano for a rendition of You Do Something To Me.   I dont know myself what the highlight of the show was. I have to admit that singing quite loudly along with my fellow fans to Thats Entertainment made me very happy. I was also pleased to hear Hes the Keeper, which Id never heard him do live before.   Paul plays in New York City tonight (at Town Hall) and tomorrow night (Irving Plaza). If you live down there, do not pass up the opportunity to see him blow the roof off these venues.

       singer/songwriter or marine biologist?   This has me totally confused. I'm browsing through the bins at  urlLink Newbury Comics  last night when I happen to see  urlLink this.   That's right, a Graham Parker anthology called "The Official Art Vandelay Tapes."   Let's pick this apart, shall we? Graham Parker is a British singer/songwriter -- a personal favorite of mine -- who's been around since the mid-seventies and can be best described as a cross between Elvis Costello and Van Morrison.   Art Vandelay, on the other hand, is George Costanza's alter ego on "Seinfeld." It's actually the "fake name" he uses whenever he doesn't want people to know his real name (Jerry's fake name, if you must know, is Kal Varnsen, and Kramer's is H.E. Pennypacker).   Can someone please explain the connection? As a fan of both Parker and Seinfeld, I'm deeply intrigued.

       obligatory subway rant   So I get off the Red Line at Park Street this morning, switch to the Green Line just in time to pick up the D train to Longwood. There's already a sea of people waiting to get on this particular train -- more than usual -- which leads me to believe that the train was considerably delayed.   In a gently assertive manner which is my norm in this situation, I make my way onto the train, whereupon I discover that it's not only crowded, but the air conditioning is not working. In the seven subway stops that ensue, sweat is oozing out of every pore in my body. And I'm wearing a shirt and tie and jacket. This is not fun.   So, MBTA, thanks for making my commute a fun and comfortable one! I suggest you take a trip down to DC and experience a subway system the way it's supposed to be.   And as far as your proposed fare hikes: I think I speak for all my fellow communters on that steam bath disguised as a train this morning when I say  fuck you.

       handcream for a generation   About a year and a half ago, I was e-mailed by a guy who ran a pop culture website called Killer Flamingo. He saw my Amazon.com reviews and asked if I'd be willing to submit some articles for his site. I sent him a review of Mike Keneally's "Wooden Smoke," which was published on the site. Later I sent him reviews of Elvis Costello's "When I Was Cruel" and Cornershop's "Handcream for a Generation," and was working on a review of "In Our Gun" by Gomez when suddenly the site disappeared. E-mails to the site's editors proved fruitless. What started out as a fun little endeavor became a thing of the past. I hate for anything I've written to wither away into nothingness, so here's a look at that Cornershop review that I wrote for Killer Flamingo back in May 2002. Yes, I'm fully aware that this is a lazy thing to do. Deal with it.   Its been almost five years since Britains Cornershop released an album, and apparently they havent spent that half-decade dilly-dallying. In addition to band members Tjinder Singh and Ben Ayres releasing an album under the name Clinton, the boys have been busy soaking up sounds and influences that make up their current new release,  Handcream for a Generation.   There can be no other explanation. Music this wide and varied cant just be thrown together in a week. If Singh, the bands singer/songwriter/de facto leader, formed his own country,  Handcream  sounds like a flip across Tjinderlands radio band. Cornershop has always been known for genre-hopping. Their last album, the justly praised  When I Was Born For the 7th Time,  combined lo-fi indie-rock/pop, reggae dub, psychedelia, scratching, a country-flavored duet, and of course, plenty of sitar and tabla. Singhs Indian background has always been a key element of the Cornershop sound. And its not just a gimmick  The last album not only pulled off the deliciously trippy, sitar-drenched Were In Yr Corner, but a cover of the Beatles Norwegian Wood that brought the song full circle by translating it into the Punjabi language. The albums single, the endlessly catchy-yet-simple Brimful of Asha, paid tribute to legendary Indian singer Asha Bhosle.   This time around, Singhs Ravi Shankar jones is still present, but to a much smaller degree. Sounds Super Recordings and Spectral Mornings are the only overt nods to that genre. The latter is a 14-minute epic featuring Oasis Noel Gallagher (more proof that the Unibrowed One has been doing his more interesting work away from his bratty little brother).   Elsewhere, the emphasis on  Handcream  is fun. This is probably the best white boy party funk Ive heard since Becks  Midnite Vultures.  Heavy Soup opens things up as a funky faux-concert intro. R&B crooner Otis Clay introduces the band behind a cooking rhythm section interspersed with cheesy canned applause (these guys revel in the lo-fi thing). The next track, Staging the Plaguing of the Raised Platform, is about as blatant a rewrite of Brimful of Asha as you can get, but Singh gets away with ithe charms our socks off with a distorted guitar lick, a kiddie chorus, and keyboard patches that sound like they were lifted off the Cars first album. Lessons Learned from Rocky I to Rocky III is a scathing (and much-deserved) attack on the music business, dressed up as a long-lost Faces or Stones raver, circa 1973. Keith Richards-style rhythm guitar pounds the song home, accompanied by sassy female backing vocals (although I doubt Mick or Rod would be caught dead singing the line Miami Beach/chicks with dicks).  The album veers from experimental (The London Radar) to relaxed, De La Soul-style hip-hop (Wogs Will Walk), all the while keeping the old-school retro vibe alive (the wonderful Slip the Drummer One sounds like it was recorded immediately after the band discovered the invention of the Vocoder).   While its a fun album that I cant picture anyone disliking, I doubt  Handcream for a Generation  will widen Cornershops fan base. Which suits me just fine. Wildly popular bands play arenas, and these guys are the perfect club act. Lean back your head, close your eyes, listen to the scratching and the sitars and shake your ass.

       fun with disposable income   To paraphrase Salt'n'Pepa, "here I go, here I go, here I go again -- girls, what's my weakness: CDs and DVDs!"   A harmless visit to  urlLink Newbury Comics  on Wednesday yielded a disc I've been awaiting for weeks now: the latest single from the Beautiful South,  urlLink "Just a Few Things That I Ain't."  The single is from their long-awaited forthcoming album, "Gaze," slated for a November release. I doubt it'll be released stateside anytime soon, which means I'll have to pay an inflated import price, but hey -- this is the Beautiful South we're talking about. I won't mind.   I've been a TBS fan since 1990 when their first album was released, and they make me very happy indeed. Their sound is hard to describe. Sort of early Elton John Meets Squeeze, with a touch of Morrissey. The band consists of three lead singers, and one of them -- Paul Heaton -- co-writes all the songs with guitarist Dave Rotheray. One of the other singers is always female. I say "always" because as of right now, TBS in on their  third  female singer. The first one, Briana Corrigan, apparently quit after finding Paul's lyrics to the song "Mini-Correct" a tad disturbing. While it's true that their is an occasional sexist thread in their always-clever (and infinitely British) words, the band's songs that are in that vein are usually told from a point of view of a complete tool (like Randy Newman's). But she hit the road, replaced by the earthy voice of Jacqueline Abbott. Jackie was a fine singer (she lent her voice to some of the band's most memorable covers, including "Everybody's Talkin'" and "Dream a Little Dream of Me"), but she had enough of the band smack dab of the middle of their 2000 US tour. As a matter of fact, she quit about two days before the band's arrival in Boston, at a show Liza and I attended. The band actually made the most of her absence, by employing third singer Dave Hemingway to take her vocal parts in the duets, giving the songs an interesting "gay" edge that wasn't there before.   After a notable absence, TBS has reformed, with Alison Wheeler taking over the latest vacant vocal slot (Liza and I joked that she herself should have auditioned for the band, being a singer herself. Pity that never happened).  The first single is incredibly infectious, a bouncy number with typically self-deprecating lyrics ("trendsetter, go-getter, international jet-setter, just a few things that I ain't") that even manages to get in a well-deserved dig at Bono and Sting. I was a bit disappointed last night, however, while playing the song at Borders last night, when a co-worker (Brian C, the bitter aging drama queen-- if you ever meet him, ask him how his dissertation is going and watch the rage ensue) pointed out to me that the piano riff is a blatant rip-off of the mid-60s hit "Cool Jerk." But I still like it.   I also picked up "Confessions of a Pop Group," the final album from Paul Weller's often-misunderstood 80s band,  urlLink The Style Council.  Weller raised an awful lot of eyebrows when he broke up the seminal 70s punk/mod band the Jam to focus on more jazz and soul-influenced sounds with this new band, which mainly consisted of he and keyboard player Mick Talbot. They released some excellent singles ("My Ever Changing Moods," "Long Hot Summer," "Speak Like a Child," among others), but it always seemed as if their grasp extended their reach. By employing too many different sounds and tackling way too many social topics in their lyrics, the band sounded unfocused. Nowadays, it doesn't help that their obsession with fashion and capturing the right sound for the right moment makes them sound horribly dated.   Still, I enjoy enough of their songs to buy the albums...although this most recent purchase is testing my loyalty. While their are some wonderful, piano-focused ballads ("A Very Deep Sea," "Confessions, 1, 2, 3"), there's also an awful lot of embarrassing synth-dominated dance music ("Iwasadoledadstoyboy," the title track). Maybe it'll grow on me.   I also succumbed to media hype last night and bought the DVD of the British TV sensation,  urlLink "The Office."  The show, which chronicles the day-to-day goings-on of, you guessed it, a British office, is a smash hit in its native country and is starting to cause a sensation on these shores (presumably due to its appearance on BBC America -- I don't watch that channel due to its overdependence on crappy reality shows, which are apparently an international phenomenon).   I watched the first three episodes last night and it's indeed a scream. The office's boss, David Brent (played by Ricky Gervais, the show's co-creator) is the ultimate asshole boss, but what's really excruciating about him is that he thinks he's funny when he's pathetically not. His attempts at humor almost always fall flat. He tries to be "one of the guys" by throwing out blatantly sexist jokes, and when they don't go over, he backtracks by saying that he despises sexism. Other characters include Gareth, the high-maintenance creep who calls himself Assistant Regional Manager when he's actually Assistant  to the  Regional Manager (an important distinction). Gareth wears his cell phone in a holster, like a detective wears his gun. It's sad. There's also the receptionist, Dawn, who's engaged to a guy who works in the warehouse but isn't above flirting with Gareth's nemesis, Tim. And so on. The show is shot almost documentary-style (DVD Journal points out quite accurately that it's "as if Christopher Guest directed 'Office Space'") and appears to be somewhat improvisational.   See this show. If you've ever worked in an office environment, I guarantee you'll find yourself nodding in agreement at the bureacracy and the constant presence of pathetic goon co-workers. That is, when you're not peeing your pants with laughter. Of course, it's just a matter of time before the US attempts to create an "Office" of its own. Which will, of course, fall flat on its face.

       elliot smith, 1969-2003   Singer/songwriter Elliot Smith  urlLink died  last night, apparently of a self-inflicted stab wound.  Smith was one of those guys whose music I'd only heard briefly (just a few songs), but everything I  did  hear was beautiful. So sad. So young.  2003 is really sucking, dead musician-wise.

       all the world is football shaped, it's just for me to kick in space   I don't really know a whole lot about Mandy Moore, except for the fact that she's a pop singer and that my ten-year-old daughter likes her. I don't think I would ever buy any of her albums, but if I was forced to, I suppose that I could deal with her latest album,  urlLink "Coverage."   Why? Well, it's an all-covers album, and Mandy (or her producers) happen to have damn good taste in music. The album's first song is a cover of...wait for it..."Senses Working Overtime," an excellent song by an excellent band, XTC, who would fit comfortably in my list of Top Ten Amazing Musical Artists. If such a list existed.   That's not all. She also covers Joe Jackson's gorgeous "Breaking Us In Two," Todd Rundgren's "Can We Still Be Friends," plus songs by the Waterboys, John Hiatt, Joan Armatrading and even some old-school Elton John (when he was still relevant).    Call me crazy, but there's something oddly comforting about the possibility of young female teenybopper fans singing  urlLink Andy Partridge's  lyrics.

       my weekend at the movies   Another weekend with Liza in Europe, another weekend by myself at the movies. There's actually some good points in seeing a flick solo. I don't have to share my snacks with anyone. I don't have to struggle to find two seats right next to each other when one will do fine. Also, nobody seems to mind when I insist on getting to the theater unbelievably early (sorry, it's just a thing I have).  So anyway, me, myself and I decided to hit the theater early Saturday evening after watching my brand-new DVD of  urlLink "Prime Suspect"  (Helen Mirren kicks ass six ways to Sunday, lads) and poring over my delectable new  urlLink book about Tintin.    I didn't know what I was going to see or where I was going to see it. I just hopped on the subway and hoped for the best. I got off at Kendall Square and headed to the oh-so-snooty Landmark Theater in hopes of seeing a good indie flick. The only one there that really caught my eye was  urlLink "Wonderland,"  which wasn't playing for about two hours. Since there's really nothing to do in Kendall Square but go to the movies and admire giant, personality-free biotech buildings, I headed to Harvard Square, where  urlLink "Intolerable Cruelty"  was playing...again, not for another hour or two.  Up to this point, I'm in total denial about refusing to consult a newspaper. It's the cinematic equivalent of the sterotypical guy who won't ask for directions. So I grab one of those ridiculous free Metro papers ("news in McNugget-size bites," snarks the Boston Globe) and see that "Intolerable Cruelty" is playing in about a half-hour at the Loews Boston Common. Leaping onto the subway like Gene Hackman in "The French Connection," I get to the theater in time to see that "Intolerable Cruelty" is sold out. Someone's got it in for me.   Long story short: I sprint over to Lowes Copley Square in time to catch "Wonderland."   How was it? Well, I enjoyed it. Val Kilmer really impressed me with his portrayal of John "Johnny Wadd" Holmes, the drug addict porn star with the enormous appendage. The film centers around the 1981 murders of Holmes' drug dealer pals, which he was suspected to be involved in. It's brutal, funny, intense, and has a great soundtrack. Oh, and Lisa Kudrow is in it and doesn't play an airhead.   Sunday saw me finally getting to see "Intolerable Cruelty." There's nothing like going to the movies on a rainy Sunday afternoon, let me tell ya. Loews Boston Common was filled to the brim, presumably with Coen Brothers fans such as myself, waiting to see what the inimitable Minnesota filmmaking duo would do with a romantic comedy.   "Intolerable Cruelty" was a fitting description of what I wanted to inflict on a few moronic audience members. The viewing experience was somewhat ruined by a small gang of pre-teens who were obviously on their last leg of an afternoon-long theater-hop. They laughed exaggeratingly loud at all the humorous lines, talked liberally throughout the film and inserted moronic comments (George Clooney: "I have something to tell you." Idiotic pre-teen: "I'm gay! Haw haw haw haw!"). Folks, it's only funny if the movie is bad and you have the intellect of a Mystery Science Theater cast member. Otherwise, shut the hell up.  Why do people do this? I understand that they're just kids, but can't they get it through their puberty-filled skulls that lots of people paid good money to sit in a theater and not be distracted by nitwits?   Good movie nonetheless. A bit sappy towards the end, but the cast was great and even though he's often thought of as a pretty boy, dammit if George Clooney isn't one hell of an actor.

       grudges are overrated   Oh, I just can't help it.  urlLink Sarah's blog  makes me laugh. I drop-kicked her link a couple of months ago after something she said rubbed me the wrong way. What a cranky thing to do. Sorry about that.   Think of this as my olive branch and my way of turning the blogging community into a gag-inducing, Hands-Across-America lovefest.

       at the show   Concerts, concerts, concerts. I've got a whole heap of 'em to attend in the coming weeks. Of course there's the highly anticipated  urlLink Paul Weller  show at Avalon next Friday. I'm sure that most people who know me or read my blog wish I would just shut my yap about Weller, but what you should really do is redirect that energy toward purchasing the man's music. He truly is an amazingly talented singer/songwriter/musician. Really. Buy  urlLink "Wild Wood"  or maybe  urlLink "Modern Classics"  if you don't believe me. Paul always puts on a fantastic show, too. The guy seems to tour constantly (like Bob Dylan) and this time, he's in the middle of an acoustic tour of the States. I'll be there, along with my sister Julie (a recently converted Weller fan) and my friend Bob. Avalon. October 24. Check it out. Hey, it's not like you have a Red Sox game to go to or anything (sorry -- had to get that one out. It sucks that they lost, but they lost, so let's move on, shall we?).  November 5 is the date that  urlLink Bill Bruford  blows everyone's collective musical minds at Scullers. Bruford is a drummer who started out in the prog community as a drummer for Yes during their early years, then went on to play for King Crimson during their exciting, noisy mid-seventies era (including the amazing "Red" album) as well as their sporadic Adrian Belew-driven 80s and 90s incarnations. Although he made his initial big bucks playing rock music, he's first and foremost a jazz drummer, which is even evident on his rock recordings. He's sort of a prog version of Stewart Copeland. He was also my primary inspiration for learning to play the drums at the tender age of ten. Anyway, Bill and his jazz band, Earthworks, will be at Scullers and so will Bob and I. Fun! Oh, and if you want to hear Bruford at the peak of his powers, check out his excellent 1979 solo album  urlLink "One of a Kind."   Speaking of  urlLink King Crimson,  I'll be correcting an error I made back in March of not seeing them by, you guessed it, seeing them on November 12 (also at Avalon). Although my interest in prog rock dates back to my grade school days, I've only recently discovered this fascinating band and am excited to catch them. Their opening act is no slouch, either. The gloriously re-formed  urlLink Living Colour  is opening. I hear they do a fierce version of AC/DC's "Back in Black." The only downside is that I'll be going solo. I can't find anyone else to go to this show. That's okay. It's not like I'll be able to talk to them over Corey Glover's screaming.

       confessions of a slacker   Okay, well, first of allsorry for the lack of activity round these parts. My video game nostalgia trip took a lot out of me, and I was so proud of it that I rather enjoyed having it at the top of the blog. Thus, I spent the last week resting on my blog laurels. So sue me.   But seriously, Ive missed blogging and am going to gently ease back into it. Id like to remind you first of all that  urlLink Bryan Beller  is releasing his first solo album,  View,  on October 28, but pre-orders are being accepted on Bryans site until this Saturday. So whip out that credit card and point your browsers accordingly. Who is Bryan Beller, you ask? Bass player extraordinaire known for several years as  urlLink Mike Keneally's  able-bodied right-hand man. Whos Mike Keneally, you ask? You should be reading this site more often  Lots of music and video purchases recently. Besides my recent obsessions with  urlLink Randy Newman  and  urlLink The Promise Ring  (wouldnt that make an interesting double-bill), I impulsively snagged a budget-priced Boomtown Rats compilation disc. The disc, entitled  urlLink "Great Songs of Indifference,"  is actually a mix of Rats songs and selections from Rats leader Geldofs spotty solo career. This annoys me because I was never crazy about Geldofs solo stuff and theres plenty of Rats stuff to fill several discs, let alone one. Admittedly, Im finding myself skipping the lesser-known tracks in favor of the ones I used to see on MTV back in the day: the mind-bogglingly infectious, horn-driven reggae of House on Fire, the scathingly political-yet-soothing Banana Republic, and of course, the ubiquitous I Dont Like Mondays. Im disappointed, however, at the absence of Up All Night, a creepy little number that was all over MTV in the early eighties (speaking of creepy  the video featured a shirtless Geldof cavorting with a python).   I also immersed myself deeper into the strange, dissonant world of French composer Olivier Messiaen and purchased a CD of his organ work  urlLink Meditations Sur le Mystere de la Sainte Trinite.  Those of you who dont know Messiaen, he was a 20th century French composer (1908-1992) who created dissonant, groundbreaking works not unlike Edgard Varese and Anton Webern. Lots of noise. Very atonal. Sounds lovely, doesnt it? The interesting thing about Messiaen is that almost all of his works were deeply rooted in his profound belief in God. People like Bach used to create works of choral harmony and chromatic symmetry to express their religious beliefs; Messiaen barreled along with little disregard for structure or key. And I love it. The organ stuff is a bit harder to take than my favorite work of his, the two-hour piano opus  urlLink "Vingt Regards Sur L'Enfant Jesus,"  but its still a thrilling ride.   A couple of music DVDs have been making me pretty happy lately. Paul Wellers  urlLink "Live at Breaehead"  was released a couple of weeks ago  its not that much different than the July 2002 London show captured on the Two Classic Performances DVD, but is still a worthy addition to any Weller fans DVD library. Paul and his band are in particularly good form and they break into some great Jam songs (Pretty Green, Man in the Corner Shop and Town Called Malice), in addition to a few Style Council numbers as well (Down in the Seine, Man of Great Promise). I also picked up the recently released special edition DVD of  urlLink "The Kids are Alright,"  an amazing documentary of the Who, originally released in 1979. If youre a fan, youll be in heaven. Tons, and I mean tons, of concert and TV footage, performances, interviews, etc. Theres the classic Smothers Brothers TV show segment where an explosion in Keith Moons drum kit sets Pete Townshends hair on fire (and seriously damages his hearing), footage from Woodstock, recording sessions for Who are You and lots more. Plus a plethora of extras.   If youre a fan of the films of Luis Bunuel, thenwellyoure one seriously twisted individual. No, really, Im starting to get into his films, and I bought the  urlLink Criterion Collection's  reissue of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie about a year ago. Its a terrific film, a surrealistic milestone and winner of the Best Foreign Film Oscar for 1972. The movie consists of a group of well-to-do friends who keep meeting for dinner and always have their plans thwarted for one reason or another. Did I mention Bunuel was strange? His last film, 1977s That Obscure Object of Desire, was also released through Criterion, and I finally bought it the other day. Fernando Rey (who is probably best-known as Charnier, a.k.a. Frog One in The French Connection) stars as a successful French businessman and widower who begins a relationship with a beautiful woman who constantly rebuffs his desires. The woman is played by two different actresses, for reasons that have never really been explained. My snooty quota is all set for a while.   One more thingTom redesigned his site and it looks quite spiffy.  urlLink Check it out.

       forgive the overwhelming rush of nostalgia   George Plimpton made me think about video games this afternoon. Really. I know it sounds strange, but it actually makes sense, if you follow the twisted corollary that is my existence.   I was reading an article about the recently-deceased Plimpton, which was actually written by a sports writer, who tracked the writers early exploits in boxing, football, baseball and other sports. He then went on to document his affiliation with the Paris Review, his books, film appearances, etc. Then I remembered the first time I had ever heard of Plimpton. In the early eighties, he made a series of television commercials for Intellivision, a home video game system manufactured by Mattel.   I grew up in the advent of the video game age. It seems as if, growing up, new games and systems were popping up all the time. When I was a grade school kid living in Paris, I remember those cool Mattel handheld electronic football games (lovingly discussed on VH1s I Love the 70s). I think it was Christmas 1978 when any kid who was anyone got one in their stocking. Those little red blips on the screen, the tiny buttons that moved you around the field and caused premature arthritis (but the painso sweet), the little bleating whistle noises, and of coursethe charge anthem that came out of the tiny speaker whenever a touchdown was scored. Ah, bliss.  It was around this time that I encountered my very first TV video game system. No, it wasnt Atarithis was the stark, black-and-white prototype known the world over as Pong. We didnt have it in our house, but our friends the Richards (whose dad worked with my dad) had one, and it was amazing. You have a controller that actuallymoves a little disc up and down to block the little pong dot from scoring a goal. Forget curing cancer, putting men in space, or feeding the worlds starving childrencheck out Pong! This, my friends, was a scientific advance.   Well, Im afraid that even Pong got old. When I got back to the States in 1979, it was only a matter of time before TV video game consoles  not to mention the arcade games  were being made better, sleeker, and with more intense graphics (relatively speaking, of course). My sister Julie got a job at the Holiday Inn in our hometown of Nashua, New Hampshire, and the lobby area not only included a Star Trek pinball machine (this was a classy joint, mind you), but also a wondrous behemoth known as Asteroids.   My most vivid memories of the summer of 1980 include the times my brother Gary and I spent freeloading off my sisters hotel job by hanging out at the swimming pool. Sometimes Julie would even join us on her days off, often bringing her little Sanyo boom box, tuned, of course, to a classic rock radio station (I seem to remember hearing a lot of Bob Seger back then).   As fun as the pool was, it was actually rather pale in comparison to the fun my chlorine-soaked brother and I had as we careened back into the hotel lobby to dutifully pump quarters into our Beloved Asteroid Machine. Usually it was Gary who did the playing since I rather sucked at this particular game. Garys spaceship would speed through outer space, smashing to bits these enormous transparent space-rocks. It was quite the time.   My cousin Stephen was having the same kind of fun, but didnt even have to leave his house, the bastard. First, his dad (my Uncle Jack) was computer-savvy enough at the time to purchase an Apple 2e home computer. Thats right, a home computer. The jealousy seeping through my veins was greener than the little plastic bucket of Slime my mother finally made me throw away. Stephen had two actual games on this computer  a primitive, text-heavy football game, and an Olympic Decathlon game (the javelin throw was a real bitch, I remember).   Soon Stephen moved on to bigger and better things with the arrival of the Magnavox Odyssey2. The first Odyssey system, developed in the early seventies, was the genesis for those early Pong games, and now the new model was a quantum leap in graphics and game variety (again, relatively speaking). Odyssey2 not only had the requisite sports games (Intellivisions specialty), but also featured sci-fi and action puzzlers like Take the Money and Run! Crypto-Logic! and War of Nerves! Apparently, exclamation points were a vital retail strategy.   The Odyssey2 was indeed impressive, but it was around this time that the more-popular Atari began popping in every other American household. Atari, now immortalized in self-consciously retro-ironic t-shirts at your local Urban Outfitters, developed a system that didnt necessarily break new video ground, but was massively popular. Call it Video Games For the Masses. I didnt own an Atari, but I knew a lot of people who did. In 1982 and 1983, my neighbors, the McFaddens, had an Atari. Around this time, puberty was kicking my ass and I knew enough about inter-gender desire to con Alicia McFadden into let me come over to play Pitfall. It turns out her younger brother played it a lot more than she, so he and I played while Alicia and Paula Davis stared out the window at the object of their affection, my older brother. My best friend in eighth grade, Jeff Kudalis, owned an Atari and we spent countless hours playing Berserk and Wizard of Wor when we really should have been doing homework.   Jeff and I were truly partners in video game crime. On the way home from school, he and I would hit the  World of Games on Main Street and play all our favorites. WOG wasnt a huge arcade, but had all the essentials: Centipede, Turbo, Missile Command, Joust, Galaga, Dig Dug, Defender (my brothers personal favorite)World of Games was able to satiate our video game needs. The game I ruled over with an iron fist was most definitely Tempest. I could play that game until my fingers bled. Ill never forget one afternoon when the machine, through some inexplicable computer glitch, suddenly issued me 50 credits for no reason. It was one of the greatest afternoons of my life.   If we wanted a bigger selection, wed have to go to the other side of town. Fun World was known for two things: a killer go-cart track and an adjacent two-story video arcade. Fun World was one of the only places where I ever saw Speed Freak, a car-race video game that included terrified stick-figures on the sidewalk that always had me in tears.   Once I moved to Orlando in 1983, my interest in the games began to wear off, but only slightly. There was an arcade on International Drive called Castle somethingCastle Games, the Castle, I dont rememberthe building was designed to look like a castle, but of course, looked cheesy and fake and touristy like everything else on that God-forsaken street. Anyway, the two games I loved in this pseudo-medieval building were Star Wars and Pole Position. I was a mild Star Wars freak and was glad they finally made a video game out of it, I always loved car race games, and both games had excellent graphics. It was soon after this that my sister and her husband had mysteriously acquired an arcade game of their own. In their basement, they installed a Donkey Kong game in the sit-down model (you know, like the ones they had in Pizza Hut). Then they got a Nintendo. This, of course, made the Atari look like the graphic equivalent of writing down the action on a pad of paper. I was growing sadmy primitive graphics days were becoming a thing of the past and I was having trouble catching up.   I think my last gasp of video game action occurred in 1989 when I was overseas in the military and my girlfriends family sent her a Gameboy. It included two cartridges: Super Mario Brothers and Tetris. Tetris, as most of you may know, is about three times more addictive than crack cocaine (but cheaper). There were more than a few times when insomnia would hit me and I would get out of bed, quietly grab the Tetris off the nightstand and sit in the bathroom playing for at least an hour. Girlfriends, bills, paychecks, shaving, not having mom make you breakfast anymorethese things will replace everything eventually, but a video game will always lobotomize you for as long as youll let it.

       I am so filled with just one girl   Why Im just now discovering and digging into the catalog of a semi-famous band that was only around from 1995 to 2002 is beyond me, but Milwaukees  urlLink Promise Ring  is kicking my ass and Im loving it.   About 18 months ago, I bought the bands 1999 album Very Emergency. I heard a lot about these guys, mainly that they fit the emo description, which can be either a curse or a blessing. I despise labels, but I think what appeals to me (tangentially, anyway) about the whole emo thing is that it seems to be a continuation of a lot of bands that I loved in the late eighties (particularly the Smiths). The emo sound is heavily rooted in emotional vocals, normally evolving into self-pity, while the band hammers away.   While many emo bands have been plying their trade over the past several years and accumulating a small yet rabid following, a few of them manage to get some national attention and appear either on the verge of superstardom or perhaps smack-dab in the middle of it. Im no expert, but I would think that Weezer is a good example of a band with emo stylings that, through some freak of nature, became huge.   While emo may not always embrace catchy hooks and singalong choruses, these Promise Ring guys tend to revel in it  at least, on the albums that Im familiar with. Very Emergency is an album that I loved when I first heard it. Then I put it away, rediscovered it about six months laterand repeated this cycle until last week when, for reasons not quite clear to me, I obsessed over it.   The album starts off with little fanfare. Davey Von Bohlens voice kicks things off with the line I got my body and my mind on the same page, and honey now, happiness is all the rage. The song, Happiness is all the Rage, celebrates the joys of staying indoors all day with someone you love. We could do more outdoor things, Davey opines, if we werent so busy getting busy. Amen.   Love and emotion seem to be the common themes in the lyrics, while the band chugs away with crunchy guitars and boisterous drumming. One of the albums most manic tunes, Happy Hour, is centered around the simple chorus Where are we living now, which ends up sounding more like a celebration than a confused query. The last minute of that song is probably the high point of the entire album for me. Just try to listen to it while sitting still.   One of the slower songs, Jersey Shore, is an affectionate tribute to getting older and moving on. The lyrics are uncharacteristically straightforward but no less poignant: Bored walking on the boardwalk, New Jersey shore / If I come to New York, can I sleep on your floor? Living out of a suitcase on the motel floor / and running up tabs at the corner store.  After spending much time immersed in this amazing album, many online reviewers informed me that their earlier stuff is more adventurous. My curiosity piqued, I grabbed a copy of Nothing Feels Good, a 1997 release. Like Very Emergency, this earlier album is still fast, intense, and catchy as hell, but a bit more inscrutable and idiosyncratic. Especially the lyrics.   It seems to me that the lyrics were probably not written with any narrative objective in mind. Its almost as if Davey likes the way the particular words  sound  and seems to find joy in repeating them over and over. Why else would he choose to sing Delaware, are you aware of Air Supply and Television, over and over and over (in the song "Is This Thing On?")?   Perfect Lines, probably my favorite song on the album (so far), confuses the hell out of everyone concerned with the interminably repeated line Lets talk about the sound of the phone outside of Texaco / from Bell South down to a Southern Belle. I dont know what it means, but I sure love it.   The band is an intense combination of guitar, bass and drums, who dont necessarily do anything groundbreaking, but seem to ooze energy with their lightning pace. When the band chooses to slow things down, like on the nostalgic Red and Blue Jeans, they give Van Bohlen plenty of room to say whats on his mind, as in the memorable line, Nothing feels good like you in red and blue jeans and your white and night things.   So, yeah, buy these albums. If the idea of a more introverted combination of the Pixies and Weezer appeals to you, youll be in heaven. And if anyone can clue me in as to what the rest of the Promise Rings albums sound like, Id love to hear it.

       randy takes on the south   I mentioned the other day that I was beginnig to develop an appreciation for the music of Randy Newman. I acted on that appreciation last night and picked up the deluxe two-disc reissue of his classic 1974 album  urlLink "Good Old Boys."  I was originally going to get  urlLink "Sail Away,"  but I couldn't find it, even though my store's inventory computer says we have it (not that the computer is ever right).   So far I've listened to the entire first disc of "Good Old Boys" and I like it a lot. There's something about Randy's early work, the string arrangements, that George Gershwin-meets-Lyle Lovett rolling piano, whatever it is, something really gets me about the songs and how they're arranged. Anyway, "Good Old Boys" is basically a concept album (or is it a "song cycle?" What's the difference? Does anyone know?) about the Deep South, examining the prejudices and personalities of that unique part of the country.   Of course, the album's first song, and perhaps the most infamous, is "Rednecks," which probably wouldn't be so notorious if it wasn't for Randy's liberal sprinkling of the "N" word all over the song. Obviously, he's singing the song from the point of view of an ignorant, bigoted Southerner, but that argument still won't get the song played on the radio. The album also includes the marvelous "Louisiana 1927," which is currently my favorite song of his.   The second disc of this "deluxe edition" consists of piano-and-vocal demos of "Johnny Cutler's Birthday," which was the original "rough draft" behind what would become "Good Old Boys." I haven't heard it yet, so I can't comment. But I imagine I won't be disappointed.

       six feet of water in the streets of evangeline   I'm starting to develop a long-overdue obsession with the music of  urlLink Randy Newman.  Be prepared for a possible barrage of posts related to him. In the meantime, here's a recent Randy Newman quote I found this morning that I really like:  "One thing with my music, you can't sit and eat potato chips and have it on in the background at a party. Norah Jones made a very good record and it's also a record you can have on in the background and it's sort of OK. I've never been like that. With me there's always the occasional 'fuck' or bad word. You'd choke on your potato chips."  Is this guy a scream or what?

       cold   For the first time in months, I'm wearing a sweater. I left my office earlier this afternoon to get a bite to eat, and there was a chill in the air. I'm so happy.      Many people are in love with the summer, and while I'll admit that fun summer-related activites do in fact exist, I'd rather be cold, thank you.   As I mentioned on this site a while ago, I hate wearing t-shirts and shorts out in public because I feel like I'm 12 years old. The last time I was 12 years old, Reagan was in his first term and Air Supply was on the radio. Times have changed (now it's George W and Celine Dion).   I like wearing my sweaters, my turtle necks and my corduroys. I'm a fall/winter kind of guy. So let me enjoy it, okay?    urlLink Millie  knows how I feel.

       infidels   My discovery of Bob Dylans music occurred in 1984 at age 15. Oh sure, Id heard of the guy before that, but wasnt really that familiar with his music. Rolling Stone magazine published a  urlLink revealing interview  with the legendary singer/songwriter. What started as a mild curiosity developed into a fascinating read and I was determined to find out more about his music. Its safe to say that the years 1984 through 1986 were Dylan-obsessive for me and I consider myself a huge fan to this day.   Revealing interview is a relative term with Dylan. The notoriously mercurial and publicity-shy king of folk-rock declared much of his private life off-limits in this Q&A with Kurt Loder, and he dodged specific questions about his recent born-again Christian phase, which he claimed had been misrepresented in the media. He was being interviewed to promote his latest album, Infidels.   This album was probably going to be a pivotal one for Bob, since his last three  Slow Train Coming, Saved and Shot of Love -- had not done well commercially or critically, and the religious bent of this trilogy resulted in lots of head-scratching from fans. Even the secular album that preceded those three (Street Legal) was considered a stiff.   Infidels went a long way in restoring the publics faith in Dylan  it sold respectably and is considered to be one of his best albums of the eighties. Unfortunately, Bob foisted a lot of crap on us in that decade  does anyone but hard-core completists actually own Down in the Groove, Knocked Out Loaded or Empire Burlesque? Still, this album tends to get knocked out of the way when people list classic Dylan albums. It doesnt help that for the longest time, Columbia wasnt doing much in the way of remastering and reissuing the Dylan catalog, which has been available for the most part on CD, albeit in ones of inferior quality.   Sony has seen the error of these ways and last month began reissuing Bobs catalog on CD/SACD hybrids (playable in standard CD players), starting with 15 classic titles, all with original album design in the Digipak format. Ive been fiscally foolish enough to buy seven of them already, but who needs groceries when youve got Blonde on Blonde, anyway?  One of the other reissues I picked up was, of course, Infidels. Its a sentimental favorite, sure, but its also a great album no matter where or when I first heard it. Since my original purchase back in 1984 was a (dont laugh) cassette copy that had worn out years ago, I was excited to hear it with fresh ears.  It still holds up. In fact, I probably like it even more. Infidels is great in an uncomplicated way: great songs and great performances. Bob enlisted the help of Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler to handle production duties, as well as add his distinctive brand of lead guitar. The musicians consist of Straits keyboard player Alan Clark, former Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor, and the legendary reggae rhythm section of Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare (which is odd, since the album doesnt really have any reggae flavored songs  but they still sound great).   Since its 1983, it would be understandable to hear a little overblown production, and there are faint echoes of that here  a big, echoey drum sound is as bad as it gets. But the sound overall is one of relaxed confidence. Knopflers guitar playing is a comforting, familiar sound, and the playing is expert throughout and a great companion to the songwriting.   Apart from the spiritually-themed Man of Peace, Dylans subject matter seems to move away at this point from Christianity on to the familiar subject of romance, coupled with a rather bitter anger toward the general evil of the world. Not many are spared in the indictments. Hes apparently not too thrilled about the space program (in License to Kill, he sings man has invented his doom / first step was touching the moon), mistrusts both capitalism and labor unions (Union Sundown), and has some pretty strong opinions about Israel and Palestine (the apparent subject of Neighborhood Bully, according to countless critics and newsgroups). Dylan was going to call the album Surviving in a Ruthless World, until someone pointed out to him that his last four albums all began with the letter S.   So I said, Well, I don't wanna get bogged down in the letter s." Dylan said in the Rolling Stone interview. And then Infidels came into my head one day. I don't know what it  means,  or anything.  It turns out that Infidels is probably one of the more fitting names he could have come up with for this album. Dylan certainly does his share of finger-pointing at politicians and heathens while pining for a more innocent time, which is why his romantic side sounds particularly enticing on tracks like the lovely Sweetheart Like You and the albums closer, Dont Fall Apart on Me Tonight.   The albums high point, for me, is probably the opening track, Jokerman. Against a rolling mid-tempo, organ-fueled soundscape, Dylan unfolds an ambitious, wordy, literate set of lyrics. It starts out:   Standing on the waters casting your bread While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing. Distant ships sailing into the mist, You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.   Later on, the lyrics get even heavier:   It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray, A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet. He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat, Take the motherless children off the street And place them at the feet of a harlot.   This is an epic, on par with Dylans classic Idiot Wind, and perhaps some of the best lyrics hes penned since the mid-seventies. Although, for the life of me, Im not really sure what hes talking about.

       tom takes on miles   One of my favorite blogger/reviewers, Tom, recently posted quite the review of the recently issued Miles Davis box set, "The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions," which has nothing to do with Ben Harper's surfer buddy. You should  urlLink read it.   I'm working on a rather lengthy review myself -- something about Bob Dylan -- but it keeps getting interrupted by actual "work." You should be able to see it later today...probably.

       word of the day   Today's Word of the Day is "hegemony." According to dictionary.com, it means "the predominant influence, as of a state, region, or group, over another or others."   I must confess that I don't think I've ever heard this word before. But it must mean something, because  urlLink the book I'm currently reading  mentions it three times in the span of five pages.   Hegemony. Try to use it at least once this week.  Runner-up: "bulwark." Also used in above-mentioned book, but only once (so far).

       gazing at island queens   An innocent diversion into  urlLink Newbury Comics  last night ended up costing me about 68 bucks, but I'm three CDs happier now.   Have I mentioned that my CD purchase rate has skyrocketed lately? Perhaps it's due to the fact that my girlfriend is in Europe for three months and therefore I have no life. Beefing up my already overflowing music collection is my way of coping. Yeah, that's it.   It may seem odd that I frequent this store, since I work part-time at  urlLink one of their competitors,  but the fact is that Newbury Comics has a few things on Borders. First of all, they have a nice used selection. I've bought used CDs there simply to save money and have yet to encounter a defective disc (knock on wood). Also, they have an impressive selection of import discs (perfect for a guy like me who enjoys a lot of artists who rarely release anything stateside). They also have various bric-a-brac like buttons, games, comics (hence the name), Reservoir Dogs action figures, t-shirts, etc.  (I'm not sure if that's the correct usage of the word "bric-a-brac," but I like the fact that I've used that in a post. So there.)   It works the other way around, too. Borders, of course, stocks books (a veritable shitload). We also have much greater jazz and classical sections (Newbury's classical selection is, quite frankly, pathetic, but then again, that's not their target audience).   The bottom line is, Newbury Comics often stocks things I can't get anywhere else. If that makes me a "retail traitor," so be it.   So last night I'm wandering down Newbury Street on my way home from work when I realize that the new  urlLink Beautiful South  album, "Gaze," was probably released recently. Having been a fan practically since the band's inception more than a dozen years ago, and knowing full well that this new release may never see an official stateside distribution, I headed into Newbury Comics to see if they could relieve my wallet of some import-priced dollars.   Ta-da! There it was. Thirty bucks? Not exactly a bargain, but eh...what are you gonna do.  Not happy to just take what I came for and leave, I began browsing. Keep in mind that Chris browsing in CD stores can outlast the Mesozoic Era, but I was determined to wrap this up quickly. Besides, I was highly anticipating plopping that new Beautiful South disc in my Walkman as soon as possible.   I came across two other discs worthy of my attention. The first was an American reissue of Queen's second album,  urlLink "Queen II."  Now I've been a Queen fan almost as long as I've been listening to music. My older siblings listened to it constantly when we were growing up. They all passed on "Queen II" (perhaps due to some less-than-favorable reviews), so at the age of ten -- September 1979, I remember it like it was yesterday -- "Queen II" became the first record I ever bought. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and even though it had a somewhat juvenile, prog-rock Dungeons and Dragons feel to it, it was  mine.  You could say I've developed a sentimental attachment to it over the years.   A couple of years ago, I bought a used British reissue CD of this album, which I enjoyed, despite the fact that the sound quality left a lot to be desired, particularly the dull, muffled drum sounds (it sounded like the drum kit was covered in damp towels). Since I've developed a whole new appreciation for this album, I've been halfheartedly on the lookout for the superior US reissue (released, like the rest of their stellar 70s catalog, on Hollywood Records). Last night I broke down and picked it up.   In addition to a clearer sound and liner notes, there are also -- like the other Hollywood reissues -- a few bonus tracks. There's a rather limp remix of "Ogre Battle" as well as a campy-but-enjoyable dance remix of "Seven Seas of Rhye" and a rather forgettable bluesy b-side called "See What a Fool I've Been."   A couple interesting highlights of the album: "March of the Black Queen," which seems like an early blueprint of "Bohemian Rhapsody;" the lovely, melodic pop of "Funny How Love Is," which is fueled by a terrific Phil Spector-ish Wall-of-Sound production; and one of guitarist Brian May's most underrated songs, the epic "Father to Son." In fact, I think the only song I outright dislike is the overly busy, Renaissance Fair-obsessed "Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke." Even the title makes me ill.   I also finally updated a cassette -- a  dubbed  cassette, for crying out loud -- of a Grace Jones compilation called  urlLink "Island Life."  In 1990, a flamboyantly gay African-American friend of mine named Davien lent me a cassette of this album, which I promptly dubbed. I was initially interested because Roman Polanski's excellent thriller  urlLink "Frantic"  prominently featured Grace's song "Libertango (I've Seen That Face Before)" and I loved it (I also like her version of the Police's "Demolition Man," but it's unfortunately not included in this compilation). Why I waited thirteen years to upgrade this to CD I'll never know.   The disc is basically highlights of her tenure with Island Records (hence the title, duh) and includes a delightful tropical take on Edith Piaf's "La Vie En Rose," in addition to a couple forgettable paint-by-numbers disco songs ("Do or Die," "I Need a Man"), some excellent covers (the Pretenders' "Private Life," Roxy Music's "Love is the Drug"). Almost every song is completely enjoyable and I love it.  This is actually an import version, titled "Island Life 2," which includes a couple of remixes that I haven't heard yet.   I've yet to be disappointed by a Beautiful South album, and  urlLink "Gaze"  is certainly no exception. Granted, they're certainly not breaking any new ground here, and their last album (2000's "Painting it Red") was slightly more ambitious (and longer), but this is exactly the kind of album you'd expect from the Beautiful South. All the right components are in check: witty, caustic lyrics, sweet voices and a musical style that manages to balance the contemporary and the classic.   The main change in the band this time around is the addition of a new female singer. The band has an interesting configuration: one guitarist, one bass player, one drummer and  three  lead singers (one female and two male). The first two female singers -- Brianna Corrigan and Jacqueline Abbott -- quit in 1992 and 2000, respectively (female singers in this band are not unlike Spinal Tap drummers). The latest woman to join the band is Alison Wheeler, and although this sounds like a lazy analogy, she sounds like a perfect combination of the first two.   Common lyrical themes with the Beautiful South are alcohol, self-deprecation, and how men are such assholes. In fact, a song on the new album, "The Gates," encapsulates their feelings on the latter subject quite nicely:   A woman goes to heaven, it's not important when, As soon as she arrives, God has to send her down again. "You've got an extra five years to clean up after men." "I mean no disrespect, God...but you'd better make it ten."   Sometimes -- as they have in the past -- the band's lyrics (written by vocalist Paul Heaton) tend to stumble in an attempt to cram as much verbosity into a song. Case in point on "Gaze" is a song called "101 Percent Man," which is apparently about homophobia, but the references and analogies are so overreaching you can't tell the point they're trying to make. Still, I'll take it over Britney's lyrics any day.   For more samplings of the band's lyrical witticisms through the years, go   urlLink here.

       interesting power-pop fact   I just found out this morning that  urlLink Andy Partridge  and  urlLink Marshall Crenshaw  were both born on the exact same day (November 11, 1953). Pretty unusual, especially when you consider that a lot of their songwriting is cut from the same cloth. Partridge is, of course, the principle singer/songwriter behind XTC, those masters of punk/new-wave power-pop (and the author of at least two dozen songs that make me very happy indeed), while Crenshaw is a solo artist who's been crafting lovely, you guessed it, punk/new-wave power pop for more than twenty years (you should buy all his albums and make him very rich).   So they both turned fifty last week. Raise your glass, take a good swig in their honor, and play XTC's "English Settlement" album, in addition to "This Is Easy," a terrific Crenshaw compilation. And wish them both a happy belated one.

       rock you like a hurricane   You need this book:  urlLink "Fargo Rock City"  by Chuck Klosterman. Well,  I  need it. I picked it up last night without ever even hearing of it, and I'll probably be done with it my the time I go to bed tonight. It's consuming all my free time and I love it.   Chuck Klosterman is a critic for the Akron Beacon Journal and grew up a heavy metal fan in the middle of North Dakota. In the eighties, he was weaned on a diet of Motley Crue, Poison, Bon Jovi, Metallica and Judas Priest. This book basically chronicles his obsessions and reexamines them in an adult light. He makes no apologies for his love of cheesy hair metal, but has a great sense of humor about it all. He's an excellent, insightful and very humorous writer (I found myself laughing out loud several times).   Why should I care about a hair-metal memoir, you ask? No, I never liked the stuff. I was in high school when that particular genre was at its peak, and I hated it. When the school jocks were wooing the cheerleaders by blasting Poison out of the speakers of their Camaros, I had Elvis Costello on the Walkman, or sometimes I would be in my best friend Nick Fraser's Pontiac Sunbird with a Smiths tape in the deck. Heavy metal was boring, vapid, and didn't do a damn thing for me. It was Music For Other People.   But I knew all the names, mainly because they were on MTV and plastered on umpteen high school classmates' t-shirts. So I can relate to what's being explained in this book, albeit from a secondhand pont of view. Besides, it's funny as hell.

       you can get it if you really want it   God bless the folks at Universal. A couple of years ago, they began to  urlLink re-release  several classic albums that fit under the Universal umbrella and put them out as two-disc "deluxe editions." This particular project has encompassed a wide variety of artists, including Bob Marley, the Who, Joe Jackson, John Coltrane, Donna Summer, Blind Faith, Howlin' Wolf, the Velvet Underground and more. I've picked up a few of these over the past year or so, and have never been disappointed. While I take issue with a few of their reissue choices (do we  really  need a special edition of Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow Down?" Even as a retro-ironic gag gift?), for the most part, they've made stellar choices.   I picked up one of the best ones over the weekend: a deluxe edition of the soundtrack to   urlLink "The Harder They Come,"  a 1973 cult classic about a reggae singer in Kingston, Jamaica. The film starred reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, who sang a good deal of the soundtrack's songs. The rest of the songs are a virtual Who's Who of late sixties/early seventies reggae: Desmond Dekker, the Melodians, Toots and the Maytals (whose seminal "Pressure Drop" -- included here -- was the inspiration for the name of this blog).   I bought my original copy of "The Harder They Come" in 1991 and not only does this disc go a long way in adding to the sound quality of these recordings, the second, "special edition" disc adds to an already excellent collection. Basically, it's 18 more songs of the same era. Some of the artists already appear in disc one, but there are others, too. Some of the tracks are well-known among even casual reggae fans (Desmond Dekker's amazing "Isrealites," Jimmy Cliff's "Viet Nam," Johnny Nash's crossover smash "I Can See Clearly Now"), while others may be familiar to those who've heard UB40's whitebread - but not altogether bad - versions (Eric Donaldson's "Cherry Oh Baby," the Melodians' "Sweet Sensation"). The original disc, coupled with the second one, make up an essential reggae primer, especially for those who think that reggae began with Bob Marley (with all due respect to Bob, it didn't), in addition to those misguided souls who feel that Sean Paul and Shaggy are decent examples of the genre.

       i didn't have to come to maui to be treated like a jerk   This isn't really very important, but for some reason I feel like telling the world: last week I learned how to play  urlLink "The Hula Hula Boys"  by Warren Zevon on Liza's keyboard that's currently living in my bedroom while she's in Europe. It's actually quite simple. Four chords -- C, G, D, G -- over and over. That's it.   My approach to playing the keyboard is much like the way I play chess or pool: I'm not good at it, but I still enjoy it.

       do you like good music?   That was the opening line of Arthur Conley's 1967 hit "Sweet Soul Music." Arthur  urlLink died  today at age 57.   Yes, he was pretty much a one-hit wonder, but man, what a song. By the way, you haven't lived until you've heard the Jam's version.

       don't let the british accents fool you   When my roommate and I recently updated our cable system, we discovered that one of our new channels is  urlLink BBC America.  This joy was compounded by my discovery of a hilarious, addictive show called  urlLink "The Office."  Unfortunately, I have yet to find any other redeeming qualities in this newfound channel.  But that doesn't stop BBC America from launching an iditiotic, misguided, inaccurate ad campaign. Basically, it's a series of ads that consist of smug American yuppies going on and on about how much they love BBC America and how much "cooler" it is than regular U.S. network television.  Now I won't argue that 99 percent of stateside TV is total crap, but the fact that BBC America somehow rises above it is a complete non-truth.   "It's edgier...it's not like American television," enthuses Smug Yuppie #1. Bullshit! It's  exactly  like American television. I'm sure that there's a lot of great British TV out there, it's just not on BBC America. They have crappy sitcoms ("Coupling," only slightly better than our crappy version, yet still crappy) in addition to idiotic reality shows ("Faking It"). So what's the difference? Of course, there are occasional gems among the crap (the aforementioned "Office").   It's a common belief (and an accurate one, I happen to think) that Europeans are more cultured than Americans. But not in this case. Hey, you Brits: quit hogging whatever good shows you've got over there and quit sending us the garbage!

       get your prog on: king crimson at avalon   You know it's a good concert if your ears are still ringing by the end of the following day. Wednesday night I had the pleasure of attending a show by not only a terrific headliner, but a strong, energetic support act as well.  urlLink King Crimson,  one of my favorite discoveries of 2003, played what could be considered an unfitting venue: the Avalon Ballroom. I say unfitting because Crimson are undoubtedly (even among their detractors) musician's musicians, playing highly intricate, disciplined, sophisticated, and rather loud, music. This is music to be listened to. A venue like the Berklee Performance Center, or maybe the Orpheum (two places they've played before) would have made the experience a bit nicer, but hey -- I'm not going to complain. These guys tore it up, and I'm perfectly happy with the show.   I was surprised upon arriving at the venue (at 7, just as the doors were to open) that the line outside Avalon was seemingly interminable. But it made sense: many people were just as happy to see the opening act -- the newly reformed  urlLink Living Colour  -- they were the headliner. This made my goal of getting as far to the front of the stage as possible (Avalon is general admission) a bit more challenging than I had hoped. Instead of "rushing" the stage, I sauntered around the merch table and picked up a very nice long-sleeve KC t-shirt. There was an amazing selection of shirts, and even a black hooded sweatshirt that was "verra" cool (to use  urlLink Heather's  expression). But sixty bucks is a bit much for a hooded sweatshirt, I don't care if it's made from the Shroud of Turn.   The demographic of this particular crowd was a bit different than I expected. I was thinking that there would be a lot of middle-aged ponytails (although there were some of those). It was mostly geeky   urlLink Berklee  students who spent their pre-show time discussing things like music theory and open tunings.   Living Colour was greeted by the crowd like no other support act I've seen. I'm convinced that many people came just to see them. Which is fine, because they blew the roof off the place. They played a lot of songs from their brand-new album,  urlLink "Collideoscope,"  in addition to some older stuff. Cory Glover, who has adopted a great sort of alien geek look ( dressed in orange with orange-dyed hair), paced the stage like a kid with ADD. This band may have been out of commission for the past several years, but Glover's voice was flawless as ever. Also playing flawlessly were dummer Will Calhoun (local dude and Berklee grad) and bass player Doug Wimbish (a veteran session musician who joined the band after their second album and has played with everyone from Mick Jagger to Madonna).   But the real star of the show was guitarist  urlLink Vernon Reid.  An exceptional, highly influential and hyper-creative guitarist, he's one of the best-known facets of this band. He was greeted with the most enthusiasm from the crowd (most of them guitarists, no doubt) and the audience members constantly shouted their approval at him throughout the set. While Living Colour's music contains some elements that I don't care for -- an overabundance of preachy lyrics and a bit too much heavy-metal guitar wanking -- combining that sound with an assured blast of funk is what gives the band its edge. It's been copied many times over the years, but never duplicated.  The band was hugely energetic -- and pretty freaking loud to boot. Some of the highlights for me included their new 9/11 song "Flying," an absolutely  ferocious  "Cult of Personality" and perhaps the best part of all, an inspired version of their song "Type" that eventually slowed down to a reggae pace and became a cover of  urlLink Junior Murvin's  classic "Police and Thieves." After hearing this transcendental cover, I'm convined these guys would make a great reggae band if they chose to go that route. Easily one of the best (if not  the  best) opening acts I've ever seen.  After the band left the stage, gear was dissassembled and moved out of the way in order for Crimson's stuff to be loaded on and set up. This was some very unusual gear. Besides a somewhat normal-looking drumset (albeit a few electronic alterations), there were two strange bass guitar-type instruments, a small keyboard station surrounded by monitors and amps, and another guitar station off to the corner by a stool.   The "strange bass guitar-type instruments" are actually  urlLink Warr guitars,  a rather odd touch-style bass guitar that Crimson bass player Trey Gunn uses, heartily endorses, and plays the living shit out of. When the band hit the stage, Trey was dressed like some sort of futurisic science-fiction orderly in a white long-sleeve shirt and white polyester pants. Groovy! Adrian Belew took his place at the keyboard/guitar/wall of monitors station, Pat Mastelotto hit the drums and the little stool with the guitar was reserved for none other than  urlLink Robert Fripp,  Crimson's only original member and the guy who started this whole thing more than 34 years ago.   Here's the deal with Fripp: during the show, he sits at the aforementioned stool, facing sideways (in order to supervise his bandmates, I suppose, control freak that he is), and plays. No movement except the fingers. A robot. Smiling occasionally, but that's it. This guy makes John Entwhistle look like Iggy Pop. Fortunately, he's one hell of a guitarist.   Also one hell of a guitarist is Belew. I've always thought he was more of a quirky vocalist who simply provided rhythm guitar behind Fripp's six-string madness, but he's quite the kick-ass musician in his own right (his solo albums, which I've sadly ignored, are supposedly brilliant). Although I suppose anyone who's played in bands with Frank Zappa, David Bowie and Talking Heads (his voice sounds uncannily like David Byrne's, by the way) knows what he's doing.   Anyone unfamiliar with anything King Crimson has done after the seventies would be confused beyond belief by the sound they've crafted since their 1981 album "Discipline." They've moved from the ponderous elements of prog rock to a heavier, more disciplined sound. There are definitely elements of heavy metal (lots of crunchy, stuttering guitar riffs), but also a very textured sound (Fripp's guitar normally has some kind of synth patch, which practically puts him in the role of "keyboard player") and lots and lots of experimentalism. One of the most amazing, surreal moments of the show came when Trey Gunn's Warr guitar was spotlighted on the ethereal, meditative and indescribable song "ConstruKction of Light."   These guys must have telekinetic powers or something. There's no other explanation as to how they can play so tightly and make so few mistakes. I don't think they're human.   While primarily instrumental, Belew sang on several of the songs, mostly the spiky hard rock stuff like "Dinosaur," "Facts of Life" and "Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With" (a very funny song about the cliches of rock music). Like Living Colour, the band used electronic samples -- mostly recorded voices -- in the songs, and the Warr guitar was even used to trigger some of the samples. Very cool. Very scary. I can't say I've ever attended a show quite like this.   The band only dipped into the seventies repertoire once (as far as I could tell, I don't own every single album), when they played the menacing title track to the 1974 album "Red" as an encore.   Anyone attending this show who has any interest in bold, experimental music that can push boundaries and ring ears was most likely extremely happy by the end of the night. Oh, and a word of warning if you plan on seeing King Crimson live -- they are very serious about the concept of no photography, to the extent that everyone entering the venue was frisked, not necessarily for weapons, but cameras. When the "frisker" saw my cellphone, he asked if it was the kind that took photos. Just a heads-up.

       happy with what you have to be happy with   Tonight I'm going to the Avalon Ballroom to see  urlLink King Crimson.  I'm quite excited about this show. Despite the fact that I should have been a fan for years, I just started listening to "the crim" about eight months ago. They fascinate me. Starting out in the late sixties as a loud, bleak, experimental prog-rock band (watch it, people) led by the inimitable Robert Fripp, this band has gone through more personnel changes than the casts of "Beverly Hills 90210" and "ER" put together. The one thread that's held it together all these years is Fripp, the mad-scientist guitar wizard. Over the years, they've gone from pure, uncut prog to quasi-Talking Heads world music (thanks to the addition of singer/guitarist Adrian Belew) to their current incarnation as something I can't for the life of me explain. Sort of like brainy metal without the bad fashion sense. This should be fun.   Another fun fact about tonight's show: for once, the support act is someone I'm actually looking forward to seeing: the newly-reformed  urlLink Living Colour.  I think I wore out my 1988 cassette of their seminal "Vivid" album years ago. Hey, as long as Corey Glover ditched the day-glo body suits, I'm there. I can't wait to hear their new cover of AC/DC's "Back in Black." Fun show! Happy Chris!  The only downside is that I'm going to this show by myself. Normally I'm able to convince Bob to come with me to this type of event, but he saw Crimson a couple of years ago and, in his words, "I'm not crazy about their new sound."  And I'll be letting you all know tomorrow what I think of this sound.

       it's only rock and roll    urlLink Sarah  made some interesting observations on her blog this morning about  urlLink the Rolling Stones  and how they are not only quintessential all-purpose bar music, but are also, as she puts it, "the soundtrack to life...everyone loves the Stones, whether they know it or not."  I'm not sure how people who are in denial about their Stones-ness would react to such a statement, but as a fan, I wholeheartedly agree. The Stones are pretty much the Default Rock Band, as far as I'm concerned. Sure, they peaked years ago, and in my opinion haven't made a vital album since 1981's  urlLink "Tattoo You,"  but their back catalog spans decades and is full of gems.   Let's say you want to go under the assumption that the British Invasion changed rock and roll (which is true in many ways, but not an assumption without its arguments). In that case, while the Beatles gave rock and roll its songwriting craft, the Stones gave it the balls. Not to mention the blues (blue balls?).   Like   urlLink Dylan  before them, the Stones' first few albums contained a large amount of cover songs, and it wasn't until their 1966 masterpiece  urlLink "Aftermath"  that they began writing all their own songs.   And what songs they were! The Stones were masters at fusing the blues sounds of their idols (Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf) with rebellious rock and roll that fueled teen angst and female lust. How could you not shimmy along to the sexy marimba of "Under My Thumb," or Brian Jones' trippy sitar in "Paint It, Black?"   The band has what you might call the essential rock and roll line-up: a charismatic lead singer in Mick Jagger, who can also blow a mean blues harp that seems to negate his materalistic jetsetting public persona; guitarist Keith Richards, who by all forms of logic should've kicked the bucket 25 years ago but still lays out those seemingly endless Chuck Berry-influence leads; the silent, stone-still yet completely original bass playing of Bill Wyman; and the jazz-influenced drumming of Charlie Watts, who always looks like he wishes he were somewhere else but has managed to stick with the band since the Kennedy administration.   The fifth slot of the Stones is the one that's harder to define. The band's starting lineup included guitarist/multi-instrumentalist/blues freak/walking pharmacy Brian Jones, who guided the boys through some of their most fervent blues mining -- not to mention their deepest experimenting. Although he never wrote a song with the band, his musical contributions were crucial to the Stones' early days. Sadly, his drug habit got the best of him and he died in 1969.   Mick Taylor replaced Brian soon after, and was around for their scary excursion to Altamont Speedway (see    urlLink "Gimme Shelter"  if you want to witness that madness), as well as two of their finest albums,  urlLink "Sticky Fingers"  and  urlLink "Exile on Main Street."  Although Taylor was -- and is -- an impeccable guitarist, he didn't seem to fit the Stones' personality and eventually ditched the band in the mid-seventies.   As far as personality goes, Ron Wood fit the band to a tee: his time spent with  urlLink the Faces,  perhaps the ultimate British party band , ensured that.   If you want vital Stones material, I would suggest picking up the following: "Aftermath,"  urlLink "Beggars Banquet,"  "Sticky Fingers," "Exile on Main Street" (in my opinion, one of the finest albums ever made by anyone),  urlLink "Some Girls"  and "Tattoo You." As far as compilations go, check out  urlLink "Hot Rocks"  or  urlLink "Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out"  (a flawless live album).   There's really no appropriate place to stick this thought in my little Stones essay, so here goes: is there anyone out there who isn't completely charmed by the Stones songs that Keith sings? Is there anyone with a heartbeat who doesn't absolutely love the manic, gleeful "Happy" or the raunch-fest known as "Little T&A?" Mick may be a legend, and the Stones certainly wouldn't be around without him, but on those rare occasions when Keith takes the vocal duties, the world somehow seems like a better place.

       they might be in the store   Last night the  urlLink Borders  where I work part-time was a flurry of activity as John Linnell and John Flansburgh, also known as  urlLink They Might Be Giants,  performed some songs and signed some product. They've actually been in our store at least twice before, and I've had the pleasure of seeing them at the Cambridge Borders last year, in addition to seeing them twice in concert and meeting them in 1995 at the TV station in Virginia where I used to work, so forgive me if I'm getting a bit jaded on the subject of the Two Johns.   I realize it sounds like I'm trying to be all cool and elitist by saying, "oh, I've seen them before, I've done that, big deal," but the truth is...oh hell, that  is  the truth. I'm totally getting elitist on your ass. Sorry.  I've been a fan of the Giants (the band, not the football team) since 1990 when I first heard their "Flood" album and fell in love with it. The problem I have with them nowadays is that their fan base is the most annoying, obsessive, get-a-life bunch of freaks I've ever had the misfortune of being caught in the middle of. And of course, last night our store was full of them.  I made the mistake a few years ago of signing on to their newsgroup. First of all, they refuse to admit that anything the band has ever done was wrong or misguided. There is no such thing as a least favorite TMBG song among these people. Every single TMBG song is the greatest song ever written. Also, the only stuff TMBG fans listen to is either TMBG or bands that sound like them (Barenaked Ladies, Moxy Fruvous, anything that involves parodies). They have musical tunnelvision and therefore I can't respect them.   Still, John and John are pretty damn cool, write brilliant songs and are very friendly and completely anti-rock star. So I'll continue to buy their music.   After the store closed I couldn't help noticing that one of the big green plastic tubs that holds our CD security "keepers" (that we haul up to the music department at the end of the night) was old and busted to the point where big plastic chunks were falling off. It was time to put it to rest. So I made an announcement over the PA that the "Jolly Green Giant" was being decommissioned and that I was getting ready to celebrate this historic event by tossing it down the escalator (keep in mind, the store is closed at this point, of course). A small crowd of employees checked out history in the making and the "tub toss" was greeted, to my sheer delight, with a round of applause and much rejoicing.   I have it on fairly good authority that John and John were in the store at the time, packing up their gear. I only wish they could have checked out the ceremony. Maybe they could have written a song about it! Can't you just picture Linnell's whiny voice (over an accordian): "He's throwiiiiiinnnnng...the keeper tub...down the eeeeeescaaaaalaaaaatorrrrr...."  Maybe not.

       everybody's favorite gangsta folkie    urlLink John Wesley Harding,  the coolest quasi-indie-folkie I've ever had the pleasure of seeing in concert, will be kicking ass and taking names at  urlLink The Middle East  (upstairs) in Cambridge Nov. 21. He's hugely entertaining and pretty damn funny to boot. Sort of like an apolitical  urlLink Billy Bragg.  You should go.   It turns out that I will be attending this show free of charge. For once, my part-time gig at  urlLink Borders  got me something besides free CDs and a mediocre paycheck. One of the record company reps asked Dave, our avuncular music supervisor, if anyone in our store would be interested in a couple free JWH tickets. Dave, knowing from our endless conversations about music that I was a big Wes supporter, put me down for two tickets. Yay Dave! Yay Wes! Yay unnamed record company rep! Life is good.    you've got a friendster   More out of bemused curiosity than anything else, I've registered at  urlLink friendster.  Time to kick back and watch the drama unfold. If any of you crazy kids out there are registered, let me know so I can beef up my friend list and not look like too much of a dork.

       the movies   Remember when I wrote on this blog about two months ago that with Liza gone for a semester in Europe, I'm going to the movies at least once every weekend? Wasn't that funny? Actually, it's not that unrealistic, but laziness tends to set in, especially on Sunday mornings, what with an apartment to myself, a coffee pot and over a thousand CDs. Yay for Sunday laziness!  With all that in mind, however, I have to admit that I wish I was back on the movie-every-weekend kick. I haven't been to the movies in about two or three weeks, when I saw "Wonderland" (exhilirating) and "Intolerable Cruelty" (enjoyable, but partially ruined by a few brats in the back row). This weekend sees the release of "Human Stain," which I'd like to see for several reasons. It looks like a good story (although I have yet to read Philip Roth's novel), the cast is pretty nifty, and it was directed by Robert Benton. Benton is hardly a prolific director, but he did direct "Kramer vs. Kramer," which is probably one of my top twenty favorite films of all time.  He also directed "Still of the Night," an excellent 1983 thriller starring Roy Scheider and Meryl Streep that was seen by absolutely nobody but me.   This will probably ruin my "indie cred," but "Love, Actually" actually looks quite entertaining. Yes, it's a chick flick, but the cast looks good and I love ensemble films, for the most part. Still, it's probably something I'll wait to watch with Liza. It's definitely a snuggling movie. Currently I'm snuggle-less.   Finally, I was all jazzed to see "Elephant," Gus Van Sant's new film, which is apparently based on the Columbine incident. Alas, I found out that for once, Boston is not listed among "select cities." Usually we're pretty lucky to catch films in this city before most places do ("Mystic River" and "Lost in Translation" are recent examples), but this time some bigwigs decided that Boston must wait. Poopieheads.

       one of a kind: bill bruford at scullers   Over the past four years or so -- since I've been back in a large city with easy access to concerts -- I've had the wonderful opportunity of not only seeing bands I enjoy casually, but also those who I consider major influences, whose music I listen to often and have been fans of for many years. The Beautiful South, Billy Bragg, Paul Weller, Graham Parker, Branford Marsalis, Joe Jackson -- these are just a few of the artists I've seen lately who fit into that category.   Last night was no exception as my friend Bob and I went to  urlLink Scullers  to see Bill Bruford in a fascinating show I won't soon forget.    urlLink Bill Bruford  is a name that may not ring a bell with the casual music fan. He started out in the late sixties as the drummer for the original line-up of  urlLink Yes,  the prog-rock band everyone loves to hate. Not only is my love for the cheesiness of certain prog bands evident (as readers of this blog can attest),  Bruford's tenure in Yes (1968-1972) constitutes what I feel is the creative peak of that band (during which they would release a mighty fine trilogy of masterpieces: "The Yes Album," "Fragile" and "Close to the Edge").   What set Bruford apart from the rest of his fellow rock musicians was a deep affinity for jazz music. It permeated everything he played. You could always hear in his playing a jazz drummer wanting to break out of the confines of rock. Although, truth be told, Yes -- for all the critical slams they took and continue to take -- were a quite adventurous band back in the day. Bruford had a crisp, regimented sound that gave an air of class to whatever he played. Ultimately he tired of Yes and moved on the the still-prog-but-more-experimental  urlLink King Crimson.  Crimson were (and still are, in a far different permutation) like Yes in the fact that they fit the "prog" mold, yet there was always something much more bold, experimental, and dark about their sound. Among the best work they did with Bruford was the dark, utterly devastating "Red," which -- unless this is an urban legend -- Kurt Cobain considered one of his all-time favorite albums.   Bruford continued to work on and off with Crimson until the mid-nineties, but he also busied himself with a vaiety of solo projects along the way, including an amazing fusion record called "One of a Kind" in 1979 and a good-but-not-as-good one called "Feels Good to Me" (which is ruined, in my opinion, by an annoying female singer that adds nothing to the music).  Freed from the shackles of rock music, Bruford has embraced his first love -- jazz -- in his most recent incarnation: founder and leader of a revolving combo of musicians known as Earthworks. Their show at Scullers last night was, for jazz fans, a stunning display of musicianship and, for the casual rock fan, an affirmation of Bruford's status as one of rock's most amazing drummers.   The band consisted of Bruford, a sax player, a pianist and bass player. Bruford explained -- to an astonished crowd -- that the pianist and bass player had only begun playing with Bruford forty-eight hours earlier. This was difficult to believe, given the fantastic interplay between all the band members. Saxophonist Tim Garland (I forgot the other members' names, sorry) has apparently been with Bruford for some time and played amazingly, alternating between different saxes and even switching to a bass clarinet for a couple of songs (an instrument I've heard before but never actually seen -- it looks like a clarinet fused with a saxophone, very odd). Garland was incredible, a brilliant, eclectic musician from whom I'd love to hear more.  The music was pretty much standard jazz improvisation, but the band were always able to duck out of the soloing and into the written figures with amazing ease. I'm no expert, but if there were any flubbed notes, I didn't hear them.   Bob and I were lucky enough to be sitting about ten feet away from Bruford himself. This was not only entertaining, but quite an education for me as well. I started playing drums at the age of ten (24 years ago), and Bruford was one of my inspirations for doing so. It was both exhilirating and a bit depressing to watch him in action and wonder how the hell he does it.   Fortunately, Bruford was kind enough to sign autographs outside the venue after the show. As I saw prog fans approach him to have various Yes and Crimson memorabilia signed, I cursed myself for not bringing anything like that along. Unlike some artists who refuse to acknowledge their past, Bill is perfectly happy to discuss his "rock life" and sign the appropriate CDs and books.   As I approached The Man with my ticket stub for his signature, I shook his hand and told him the perfectly truthful fact that he indeed was one of my inspirations for learning the drums at age ten. Unfortunately I was unprepared for his question:   "Do you still play?"  Slightly embarrassed, I admitted to him, "No. You could say I'm lapsed." I haven't been in a band for ten years, actually.   Bill smiled and shook my hand again. I wish I could have told him that I was in some big band making millions, but I guess only one of us can claim that.

       billy joel is ruining my morning   I was in someone else's office for a few minutes this morning, and  urlLink "Keeping the Faith"  by Billy Joel was playing on their radio. Now I can't get that stupid song out of my head. "Combed my hair in a pompadour - like the rest of the romeos wore..." Curse you, Billy Joel!

       mushi-mushi   Happy holidays! Why the long face? Yes, Christmas is over, but we still have New Year's Eve to look forward to, and 2004 promises an optimistic shimmer of hope for you and me and all of mankind! Really! Trust me on this.   I don't know what that was all about, I just feel bad about not blogging much lately and I figured that an overenthusiastic greeting would distract you from the lack of attention I've been paying to my blog.   Christmas Eve was nice. Liza and I finished off a shift at Borders (where the store closed at 7 pm, which is two hours early, but still...c'mon people, if you haven't bought your gifts five hours before Christmas, you ain't buying them at all), then we headed to Aunt Linda and Uncle Bobby's, where we feasted on catered food that was saved for us (everyone else ate a few hours earlier).   We ended up staying at my sister Julie's place from the 24th to the 28th, since she flew down to Baltimore to visit my mother and her dog-sitting plan fell through at the last minute. So Liza and I had the place to ourselves, and took care of Barney and Bea (Julie's dogs). Fun! On Christmas Day we headed over to my place, where my roommate Frank made a lovely brunch and invited over our co-worker Eileen and her partner Laura. There was salad, quiche, potatoes, apple pie, three kinds of booze (champagne, wine and Bailey's) and a plethora of present-opening.   Frank of course was a wonderfully tipsy host, to the point where he even broke out his story about meeting Ginger Rogers in the men's room at Studio 54 (a classic).   I should mention at this point that Julie's house has a brand-new computer, and I was planning to burn CDs and do some blogging over the weekend, but I accomplished neither. Oh well.   Julie lent us not only her home, but also her car, so we took full advantage of that. Liza even drove me to work at Borders on Saturday morning when the subway would have worked just fine. We also drove to a mall in Braintree where we used the Banana Republic gift certificates my mother got us. Then we saw the latest "Lord of the Rings" installment.   What did you all think of that movie, anyway? Not being a Tolkien expert by any means, I've accompanied Liza to all three of these movies (she's a big fan), and found myself pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed them. The first one was really nice (I loved all the stuff that took place in the Hobbit village), the second one a little gloomy and rather tedious in parts, and the latest one...well, first of all: three and a half hours? Jesus, people...it's called "editing." Look into it.  Don't get me wrong. It was a highly enjoyable, very well-made film. But that last half-hour...how many loose ends do they need to wrap up? There were about six times in that last part where I thought the credits would roll, and then: ta-da! Another scene. We get it. It's over. Everyone's sad. Sam and Frodo love each other. Take some Kleenex and get on with your lives already. Sorry. I really liked it. But once you get past the 200 MINUTE mark, "epic" far too easily translates to"excess."   I also saw "Lost in Translation" for the third time. That's right. Hey, I like this movie, okay? I saw it when it first came out back in September. Then I convinced Suarez a.k.a. Sanchez to see it with me a couple of weeks ago. We both like it so much that we went again over the weekend, with Liza (who loved it).  We also found it to be endlessly quotable (particularly any dialogue spoken by the airhead actress character -- "I have the worst B.O. today!").  I think you're all caught up now. Forgive the lack of links, creating them is such a pain in the ass on Blogger.

       get over yourself, part two   I can't really say that I've heard any of Ryan Adams' music -- except for that song he wrote about New York that was played  ad nauseum  after 9/11 -- but whether he's talented or not, he apparently has an overwhelming need to get over himself.   First, there was the infamous story earlier this year about a guy in the audience at one of Adams' shows who suggested he play "Summer of '69" -- get it, the  Bryan  Adams song? -- and then Adams throwing a ten-dollar bill at the heckler, suggesting that he leave the venue with his "refund." What a crybaby!  And now there's Jim Derogatis'  urlLink review  of an Adams show from earlier this month that documents this prima donna's petulant, whiny behavior. The nadir for me was his pointless ridicule of Wilco. Derogatis put it nicely: "Adams can release three CDs in a three-week span, but the fact remains that he still can't write one song as original or as heartfelt as anything by Jeff Tweedy."   Maybe I'm just biased since I love Jeff Tweedy, but I'm looking forward to Ryan Adams' eventual self-destruction.

       return of the liza   After three months in Europe, Liza's back in town! Having my girlfriend back in the same continent, let alone the same room as me is indeed quite a delightful situation and I'm insanely happy about it. The night she got back, we got together for dinner at Anna's Taqueria on Beacon Street with a bunch of the new friends she made during her  urlLink semester abroad.  I'm happy to say that they're all just peachy. Yay for new friends.   Our first weekend back together consisted of Liza meeting me at  urlLink Borders  after my shift, a which point we walked over to the apartment I found for her in the North End that she still hasn't seen the inside of yet (I did some apartment-searching for her while she was gone). Her friend Nicole is a definite lock for a roommate, and they have some prospects for a third, but they need to find someone by January 1st. Whatever the case, Liza really likes the *outside* of the apartment, it looks like the realtor is going to give her and Nicole a set of keys tomorrow. I feel really strange knowing that two people (one of them I've only known for a few days) are about to move into a place that I picked out that they still haven't seen yet, but I'm dealing with it. Hey, it has a roof deck! That should seal the deal for anyone.   Later, we went to Central Square, where Liza had a dance audition. I killed time by wandering around Central Square, walked down Vassar Street (where I was hypnotized by a stunningly modern-looking MIT building  known as  urlLink Simmons Hall ), back around Central Square, down to Harvard Square and back to Central. I also checked out Skippy White's, a lovely used record store that specializes in classic R&B. I picked up a nice  urlLink Hank Ballard  CD, which made my trekking around Cambridge a lot more fun (especially since I ended up playing "Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go" about five times in a row. I can never get sick of that song).   Liza and I then went to see  urlLink "Love, Actually,"  which I saw a couple of months ago with my sister Julie, but had to see again since it basically has "Liza" written all over it. Silly, sappy but very entertaining sort-of chick flick. Of course. She loved it, and I enjoyed it once again. Bill Nighy's performance as aging pop star Billy Mack is worth the price of admission.   Sunday we went with her friend Zoe to see  urlLink "Kill Bill."  I'm still on the fence about this movie. I can't really 100 percent wholeheartedly recommend it, but there are definitely some nice moments that remind me why Quentin Tarantino deserves a lot of the praise he's been given in his career. Unfortunately, there was much to fault as well. I have nothing against gratuitous violence per se, but it almost seemed as if Tarantino was trying to see how much he could get away with. It seemed misguided. Also, I think that he's trying to outdo "Pulp Fiction." He probably realizes that 99 percent of the people out there (myself included) find that film to be his crowning acheivement, a work of art that he will most likely never top. So he decides to push the "overkill" button and hope we'll ignore the flimsy plot and enormous amount of disbelief suspension required. "Yeah, I know that this character would not be conscious after losing all that blood when her arm was chopped off," he seems to be saying, "but look at that fountain of blood and how majestically it shoots out of the dead guy's neck!"  The cinematography is quite something. The fight sequences (and there's a lot of them) are very well-choreographed. The music, as always with Tarantino, is wall-to-wall and very well chosen. But it seems like all style and no substance. Maybe when the excellent, underrated and relatively low-key "Jackie Brown" failed to blow anyone away at the box office, Tarantino decided to do a complete 180, buy fake blood in bulk and go for broke. Who knows.   Anyway, where was I...oh, after the movie, Liza and I met my sister Julie for dinner at  urlLink Chef Chang's.  I'm not a huge expert (or even a huge fan) of Asian food, but this place is fantastic. I've been here about four times so far, and every experience has been wonderful. The food is great, the ambience very cozy, the service impeccable, and...well, just go there. Julie also gave us our Christmas gifts...memberships to the  urlLink Museum of Fine Arts.  Julie rocks. It's official.

       2003: music in review, part two   More stuff from this year that made me happy:   urlLink Randy Newman: Songbook, Vol. 1  This was the year that I discovered Newman and his witty, engaging songwriting. Good thing, too: this was also the year he released this truly unique form of anthology. "Songbook" is a collection of Randy's songs, stripped down and re-recorded with just vocals and piano. Sort of an "Unplugged in the Studio" kind of thing. You get the big songs ("You Can Leave Your Hat On," "Sail Away," "Louisiana 1927"), a few obscure ones (the hilarious "Great Nations of Europe") and a few instrumental themes from his voluminous soundtrack work. A great way to discover this winning singer/songwriter.    urlLink King Crimson: The Power to Believe  Crimson was another one of my 2003 discoveries, and I'm amazed it's taken me this long. I've been a closet prog freak for decades (literally), and these guys pretty much wrote the book on the genre. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that guitarist Robert Fripp is the only remaining original member since their 1969 debut, their music has remained amazingly fresh over the years. The secret is not only Fripp's willingness to move into uncharted waters, but also his knack for picking the most daring and talented musicians to join the fray. The band has moved from medeival art-rock stylings to a jarring world music/Talking Heads mode to their current incarnation, which can be best described as intelligent fusion metal. "The Power to Believe" is one of the best things I've heard from this band's current incarnation. Fripp, guitarist/vocalist/lyricist Adrian Belew, bass player Trey Gunn and drummer Pat Mastelotto craft a unique, highly experimental sound that guides them through tricky, trippy instrumentals and good old-fashioned rock stompers. A band that refuses to compromise is captured here at the height of their powers.    urlLink The Beautiful South: Gaze  Rising from the ashes of the Housemartins in the late eighties, singer/lyricist extraordinaire Paul Heaton formed this quirky band to wide acclaim in their native England, but they've made little impression on this side of the pond. It's a shame, since their brand of witty, catchy songwriting is unlike anything else out there. The best way to describe the Beautiful South is "Squeeze meets early Elton John with a touch of the Smiths." Heaton's cynical, bitingly satiric and often disturbing lyrics are wrapped in sweet, irresistible melodies (written by guitarist Dave Rotheray). Heaton is aided vocally by former Housemartins drummer Dave Hemingway and Alison Wheeler (the latest of the band's  female singers, who seem to rotate in and out of the band like Spinal Tap drummers). "Gaze" isn't their finest moment, but that's like saying that the Ritz may not be the nicest hotel in town since there's a Four Seasons down the street. It's all relative, and I personally feel that these guys are incapable of making a bad album. There's a lot of great stuff here, including the catchy first single, "Just a Few Things That I Ain't," the anti-homophobic "101 Percent Man" and the gorgeous "Get Here."    urlLink Me First and the Gimme Gimmes: Take a Break  Call me a sell-out, call me a bandwagon jumper, strip me of whatever "indie cred" I may possess, but God help me, I can't help loving these guys. What they do is fairly simple and has the possibility to get old after a few albums: take a variety of cover songs and turn them into punk rock rave-ups. Why not? Most of the Me First albums have a theme, and this one seems to be about R&B, past and present. The guys deconstruct every thing from "You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman" to "I Believe I Can Fly" to "Mona Lisa" to "Nothing Compares 2 U," and they do it all beautifully. There's no message here, this band will never change the world, they just have a lot of fun. And that fun is extremely contagious. Lighten up and enjoy.    urlLink Warren Zevon: "The Wind"  The story's been chronicled ad nauseum, but it's still worth retelling: Zevon was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in the summer of 2002, and instead of going quietly, he rushed out one more album, enlisting the aid of friends and fans. That album, "The Wind" (released in late August, about two weeks before his death) isn't necessarily the best thing he's ever done, but as with the Beautiful South, it's all relative. It's not better than "Excitable Boy," "Life'll Kill Ya" or "Sentimental Hygiene," but it definitely has some great moments. Highlights include "Disorder in the House" (his rousing collaboration with Bruce Springsteen), a beautiful cover of Dylan's "Knockin' on Heaven's Door," "Numb as a Statue" (a piano-based mid-tempo number than recalls old-school Zevon) and an expecially poignant closer, "Keep Me In Your Heart" (which I can't listen to without a tear welling up. You got a problem with that?) Warren amassed a huge collection of strong, beautiful music in his lifetime, and "The Wind" is a fitting swan song.   I'd also like to thank everyone responsible for the first batch of Bob Dylan reissues, as well as the continuation of the Elvis Costello and Yes reissues. They made my year.

       2003: music in review, part one   It's that time of year. You can't escape it. Writers, reviewers and bloggers of all shapes and sizes can't wait to dispatch their "Best Of" lists of 2003. Let's dispense with the pleasantries, shall we? Here is a totally random list, in no order whatsoever, of a bunch of albums that came out this year that made me very happy.    urlLink Paul Weller: Fly on the Wall  Collections of b-sides and rarities are often an artist's way of biding time while waiting for a new burst of creative inspiration. If that's the case here, so be it. Weller's been cranking out amazing music for a quarter-century, he can afford to relax. Plus, this collection is more than just filler. There's three discs of alternate takes and b-sides that stand up very well on their own. Two things stand out in this set: one, there's a handful of enganging instrumentals that make you wish Weller would release more of that kind of stuff; and two, the third disc consists entirely of covers (ranging from the Beatles to Ben Harper to Sonny and Cher) that is worth the price of admission alone. You haven't lived until you've heard Paul belt out "Bang Bang."   urlLink Joe Jackson: Volume 4  I've been a Joe Jackson fan since the age of ten, when I learned how to play the drums on a friend's set with "Is She Really Going Out With Him" on the headphones. After numerous mostly successful musical experiments, Joe reunited his original "Look Sharp" band and foisted an endlessly catchy, completely winning set of brand new songs on the world. The old power-punk bile is intact, along with some lovely ballads he's perfected along the way. This isn't just some old fart attempting to relive his glory days: it could be a quartet of hungry twentysomethings if you didn't know better.    urlLink Elvis Costello: North  Like Jackson, Costello has done his share of musical experimentalism over the years. Every thing from straight country-western to string quartets to collaborations with noted classical vocalists. In 1998, he teamed up with legendary songwriter/arranger Burt Bacharach for "Painted From Memory," an album that contained a few great songs, but a bit too much sappiness for my tastes. Ditching Bacharach this time around, Costello continued in that album's vein with "North," which consists of vocals and piano (ably assisted by his keyboard-playing partner-in-crime, Steve Nieve), in addition to some lovely, tasteful orchestration. The result is a sumptuous, jazzy masterpiece -- what "Painted..." should've been.   urlLink The Beatles: Let it Be...Naked  "Let it Be," for me, was always a spotty effort from the Fab Four. It contained some great songs, but a lot of filler, and those Phil Spector-arranged strings were just as sappy as the critics claimed. So in 2003, a new version emerged, without the strings, without the short joke songs ("Maggie Mae," "Dig It") and with the addition of the sexy single "Don't Let Me Down." Yes, there are the usual Beatles crowd-pleasers here ("Get Back," the title track), but also a few semi-obscure gems that I consider to be among their best songs ("I Dig a Pony," "I've Got a Feeling").   urlLink Bryan Beller: View  Beller is probably best-known as the bass-playing right hand man of the obscenely talented  urlLink Mike Keneally,  and after years of standing in the shadows, he decided to take the plunge and record his very own solo album. The absurdly musical "View" is mostly what you would expect from this hyperactive Berklee grad: expertly played jazz/rock fusion that doesn't take itself too seriously. But there's also some warm, lyrical acoustic bass solos, in addition to a few tunes with lyrics (which mostly work). The whole thing just reeks of manic fun in the studio. Beller is joined by Keneally, in addition to other MK cohorts like Rick Musallam and Tricia Steele. A beautiful piece of music. Please buy this and make Beller rich. He deserves it.    urlLink Fountains of Wayne: Welcome Interstate Managers  The third album from these crunchy power-popsters finds them finally enjoying the success they deserve. Sure, "Stacy's Mom" is being played on pop radio and TRL, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy it. These songs are so sweet and catchy, they're like a digital sugar rush. I don't even know where to begin with this one: there's the kickin', working-class woe of "Bright Future in Sales," the erzata cry-in-your-beer country of "Hung Up on You" (which blatantly rips off Elvis Costello's "Stranger in the House"), the new wave psychedelia of "No Better Place," the hilarious "Fire Island." These guys have something that's sore lacking in today's music scene: songwriting craft. Live long and prosper, Fountains.   urlLink Soundtrack: The Harder They Come (deluxe edition)  This seminal reggae soundtrack, first released in 1973, has always been a favorite of mine, fusing the talents of Desmond Dekker, Jimmy Cliff, the Maytals and a host of other reggae greats from the time. The new Universal reissue is a huge leap forward, including a second disc of similar reggae music from the same period. Classics like "Isrealites," "It Mek," "Pomps and Pride," "Cherry Oh Baby" and Jimmy Cliff's "Vietnam" are placed in the best possible context, and the whole collection becomes a primer for all that's good in reggae music. All due respect to the late great Bob Marley: shelve that worn copy of "Legend" for a while and put this on.   Stay tuned for the next installment: prog rock redux, little-known British songsmiths, power-punk covers and some sorely needed reissues come to light in '03, and I'll discuss them tomorrow.

       a sappy airport scene is in the works   In roughly twenty-five hours, Liza's plane will be landing at Logan Airport. That's right, my girlfriend will be back in Boston after three months studying in Europe.  I will be happy. Joyous. Even downright giddy. I always knew that I would make it through this ordeal relatively unscathed, but Jesus, this has been a long three months. I also told myself that I would lose a lot of weight in that period, so if anyone knows of a good liposuction place that takes walk-ins, let me know by tomorrow afternoon. Thanks.

       coolidge corner becomes tokyo   So last Saturday night, Suarez and I went to see  urlLink "Lost in Translation"  at the inimitable Coolidge Corner Theater. I already saw the movie a few months ago (the day it was released, in fact), but there was nothing else playing that I really wanted to see, and since she hadn't seen it yet, we decided to go for it. I was struck once again by many fascinating things while watching this movie, including how incredibly bright and garish downtown Tokyo seems to be, how beautiful  urlLink Scarlett Johansson  is, and what a nice little acting niche  urlLink Bill Murray's  made for himself lately. He could have easily gone the Chevy Chase route and made self-parodying comic flops until he keeled over and died, but instead he's chosen quirky, original roles in films like "Rushmore," "The Royal Tenenbaums" and a Jim Jarmusch film called  urlLink "Cigarettes and Coffee"  (I know nothing about this film other than what IMDB says -- but hey, it's Jim Jarmusch, it can't be half bad).  Many people were ticked off when Murray didn't get an Oscar nomination for his role as Herman Blume, the wealthy industrialist in "Rushmore" -- which I felt he deserved -- but the fact that he's even being considered for these types of awards is admirable, considering the fact that most people associated him with "Ghostbusters" and "Saturday Night Live" during the first ten to fifteen years of his career.   Other things I love about this movie: the spacey soundtrack that combines the Jesus and Mary Chain, Air, My Bloody Valentine and more; Giovanni Ribisi as the absent-minded, career-obssessed husband; the numerous panoramic shots from inside the high-rise hotel; the karaoke scenes; the orange camouflage t-shirt Murray wears during one of his nights on the town; and Anna Faris' portrayal of the typical airhead movie star.   There are more, and I'll think of them the next time I see this film.

       blog in c-minor   In the spring of 1997, I was living in Naples, Italy and my wife and I had been separated for a few months already. I was enjoying my newfound freedom by spending my evenings reading books in my apartment. One of these books was  urlLink "Icon"  by Frederick Forsyth, and I distinctly remember listening to my new  urlLink Beethoven piano sonata CD  at the same time. I was still pretty green on the subject of classical music at the time, and the Sonata No. 8 in C-minor (the "Pathetique") had an enormous effect on me, to the extent that it's still, six and a half years and a couple hundred CDs later, one of my favorites.   A few years later, I became the proud owner of a Mozart two-disc freebie that included, among other things, Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-minor (K. 457), which also had a profound effect on me. Many piano pieces have come in and out of my ears in the interim between the espionage book background of Beethoven's "Pathetique" and the promo CD-induced discovery of K. 457, but there was something about these two pieces that fascinated me to the point where I know I'll never tire of them.   Suddenly, it hit me: the common thread that runs through these two sonatas...c-minor! That must be it. The key of c-minor just...I don't know... does  something for me. It's strange, since normally minor chords depress the hell out of me. But in the context of solo piano, it just  works.   Incidentally, if you want a definitive (for me) interpretation of K. 457, in addition to all of Mozart's piano sonatas and variations, buy   urlLink this box set.  It's a beautiful thing (I raved about it upon initial purchase in my May 13 blog entry, "Box Sets and John Cusack").

       the blog that just sat there   Once again, I must apologize for the lack of activity. The reason I sit at this computer five days a week, after all, is to accomplish "official" work and pick up a paycheck once a week. The blog, unfortunately, was never part of the deal. My job has been getting more challenging lately, with added responsibilities (which fortunately included added pay), so I must concentrate on that and blog a bit less. If this saddens you (sniff, sniff), it's not my intention. I will continue to blog, but probably not on a daily basis.   So that's it! I'm still alive and boy am I glad you are too. This afternoon I had lunch with several co-workers at a local Bertucci's. Try the pesto sandwich, you'll love it. This weekend I start my Christmas shopping. I also plan to go to the movies, but I don't know what I'm going to see. Has anyone seen "21 Grams?" That's on the list of possibilities.   Have a great weekend.

       descanse en paz   Ruben Gonzalez  urlLink died  yesterday at the age of 84. If you're unfamiliar with this name, I don't blame you. I never heard of the guy until about three years ago, when I bought the CD  urlLink "Introducing Ruben Gonzalez"  after  urlLink Mike Keneally  raved about it on his website.   Ruben was a Cuban-born pianist who enjoyed fame in his native country and eventually shot to American and international stardom just a few years ago after he was featured in  urlLink "Buena Vista Social Club,"  Ry Cooder's love note to the music of Cuba. Gonzalez, along with other Cuban stars such as Ibraham Ferrer, Omara Portuondo and Compay Segundo (who also passed away recently) were featured recording in a Havana studio and eventually performing live in Amsterdam and Carnegie Hall. It's an inspirational story of a small cadre of dedicated and immensely talented performers undaunted by age.   Words can only say so much. You have to hear Ruben's music to believe it. "Introducing..." is a gem, nine tracks of pure exhiliration. Ruben's piano playing -- sort of a Latin-tinged Thelonious Monk -- defies his age. He glides up and down the keyboard with pure grace. Buy this disc. I have yet to play it for anyone who didn't love it.

       the weather outside is frightful   I live in Boston, so I'm sort of bound by law to post something on my blog to the effect of, "how about that snow, huh?"  Since I don't own a car, the weather didn't really have too much of an effect on me. That is, until I changed my mind about going to the movies that night (hey, walking to the Kendall Square Cinema from the subway station is enough of a trek  without  the snow) So I ended up staying home and cuddling up with true crime TV. That's right, a nice one-two punch of  urlLink "American Justice"  and  urlLink "Cold Case Files."  Love that Bill Kurtis.  Sunday was going to be a "laze around the house, drink coffee and watch documentaries" kind of day, until my sister Julie called and asked if maybe I wouldn't mind helping her dig her car out from a good 12 to 18 inches of snow. Why of course. I'm such a good brother. I was rewarded for my hard work with lunch at a nearby pub/restaurant, Gerard's, which is a decent place except for the fact that you have to access it by walking through a convenience store. My Dijon burger was yummy. We then watched her rented DVD of  urlLink "Finding Nemo"  and took her dogs, Barney and Bea, for a walk.   I also started a rather good book last night:  urlLink "Mission Flats"  by William Landay. I picked up a free copy at Borders after I was allowed to take five advance galley copies of various books from the managers office after busting my hump on an overtime-sucking project last weekend. The book is turning out to be quite entertaining. A gritty, boston-based crime novel very much in the vein of Dorchester homey  urlLink Dennis Lehane.  Good stuff. Highly recommended.   By the way, now that I think about it, the weather not really having much an effect on me is wrong on two counts: first of all, clearing sidewalks is apparently not a huge priority in my neighborhood, which makes my walk to the subway not unlike some psychotic obstacle course. Second of all...despite my occasional bitching and moaning, I really love this weather.

       1940-1993   I meant to post something about this yesterday, and then things got so crazy at the office and I completely forgot about it.  urlLink Frank Zappa  died ten years ago yesterday.   Anyone who knows my musical tastes to any great extent knows that Frank is my musical hero. I became a fan in 1983 at age fourteen thanks to the voracious musical appetite of my older brother. What initially attracted me to Frank's music was the toilet humor. I was, after all, in junior high school at the time. But as I got older I realized what an amazingly talented composer, arranger, guitarist, producer and bandleader this unique gentleman truly was. The man was a genius.   Most people use the word "genius" to describe everything from a stand-up comedian to the guy who fixed their sink. I hardly ever use the word. It's overused in our society and therefore its value has been cheapened. I'm a massive film and music fan, but I can think of few actual geniuses in the entertainment industry. Stanley Kubrick was one. As far as rock music goes -- again, this is a genre I love dearly -- Frank is the only one that springs to mind. His mind was simply overflowing with rich musical ideas.  For a good overview of Frank's catalog, check out "We're Only In It For the Money," "Hot Rats," "You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore Vol. 2 (The Helsinki Concert)," "One Size Fits All" and "The Yellow Shark." These albums should put to rest anyone's misconceptions that Frank was simply a guy who wrote silly songs about sex.

       laughing out loud   Not much posting 'round these parts lately, and that's -- as always -- due to the fact that work's been getting in the way. A thousand curses, gainful employment!  I must tell you, however, that last night, while channel-surfing late-night television, I saw two commercials in a row on Comedy Central that made me laugh out loud. Perhaps it was just the fact that the weekend was right around the corner, but I got all goofy and cracked the hell up. By myself.  I was watching "Tough Crowd" with Colin Quinn (a pretty funny show, depending on the guests) and during a break, two Comedy Central ads aired. The first was for the channel's very first "comedy awards show" (hosted by the hilarious Andy Richter), and it's called...wait for it..."The Commies." I was crackin' up, I tell you.   The second ad was for a Comedy Central exclusive movie about a Jewish crime fighter called "The Hebrew Hammer." I couldn't help laughing when the ad said "his methods are Orthodox." Comedy Central, you're killing me.

       a hardly silent night   Some people actively seek out Christmas music. They'll go to the store, buy it, play it at home -- either alone or at a get-together -- while some people detest it with a passion.  Like  urlLink Tom,  I'm somewhere in the middle. I've accepted it as part of our culture. It's out there, you don't have to  embrace  it, but try to deal with it for the next few weeks.   But working part-time at Borders, it's hard to catch a break. We're pretty much forced to play it 24/7 during the holiday season. I make do by playing the stuff I like. Here's a guide to what I can stand and what makes me retch in the holiday music arena:  Stuff I like:  urlLink "Ultra-Lounge Christmas Cocktails"  -- hey, holiday music is supposed to be cheesy, so why not go all out. The Ultra-Lounge series embraces the concept of gaudy hammond organs and cha-cha beats, and this time, they've given Kris Kringle and his gang the lounge treatment. Favorite cut: "Cha-Cha All the Way," with the immortal line, "Jingle bells, jing-jingle cha-cha-cha, jingle all the way / love the rhythm of Christmas time down South America Way..." Last week in the store I played that song three times in a row.    urlLink "A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector"  -- forget for a minute that Phil apparently wasted his girlfriend. A legendary producer, Spector redefined recording techniques in the 1960s with his "Wall of Sound," breathing life into girl groups like the Crystals and the Ronettes (so what if he fucked up "Let it Be"). Here, classic female artists under Spector's wing, like the aforementioned ones in addition to Darlene Love and Bob B. Soxx and the Blue Jeans, make you long for skinny ties and beehive hairdos while decorating the tree.     urlLink "Mahalia Jackson Sings Songs of Christmas!"  --  despite what capitalism may tell you, Christmas is, after all, a religious holiday. And if you're gonna raise the roof, who better than Mahalia to help you get in the mood? Blessed with a gorgeous singing voice, this pillar of sacred music sings her heart out almost enough to make you forget Stevie Nicks' croaking version of "Silent Night." Almost.    urlLink Marcus Roberts: "Prayer for Peace"  -- as usual, Roberts -- an incomparable jazz pianist -- is all class in a series of solo piano holiday pieces. His stuff is usually a little hard to find, but if you like this one, try his non-holiday stuff too, like "Alone With Three Giants" and "As Serenity Approaches."   urlLink Vince Guaraldi: "A Charlie Brown Christmas"  -- yes, we've heard it all a thousand times. But who cares? This stuff is timeless, from the kids singing the carols out of tune to the beautiful rendition of "O Tannenbaum" to the impossible-to-resist "Linus and Lucy." Some things never get old.   The stuff I hate: Paul McCartney: "Wonderful Christmas" -- I'm going along with  urlLink Dan  on this one. He called it "a truly vile song." I'll go one further: it's without a doubt one of the most simpering, condescending, amateurish, annoying, brain-numbing pieces of trash that any human being could ever have the stomach to commit to sheet music.   Elmo & Patsy: "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer" -- stupid, annoying, overplayed, painfully unfunny, stupid, overrated, and, oh yeah...stupid. Let's put this one to rest, and bury it next to grandma, okay?  Various Artists: "Very Special Christmas" -- there's no way in hell I'm providing a link to this piece of trash, since the last thing it needs is more publicity. I realize that it's for charity, but there are more worthwhile ways to contribute to a cause than having to buy into this compost heap one more time. First things first: this thing gets overplayed every year since it first came out (about 15 years ago). Where do I begin? There is no reason why anyone should have to suffer through Bryan Adams painfully bad rendition of "Run Rudolph Run" when far superior versions by both Chuck Berry and Dave Edmunds are available. As far as "Christmas in Hollis" by Run-DMC is concerned: it was funny the first time. Not anymore. Madonna doing "Santa Baby?" I dislike Madonna enough as it is; when she's in faux-Marilyn Monroe mode, she's even worse. And that's not even half the album. Resist the urge to buy this. If you own it, I'm sure  urlLink CD Spins  will take it off your hands.

       happy thanksgiving, where's the dayquil?   Now that I've succeeded in casting a pall over my entire blog with that thoroughly depressing post about my sad dream, how about I do what everyone else seems to be doing -- talk about my Thanksgiving weekend? Okay? Okay!  Wednesday night -- the night before Thanksgiving -- is, as  urlLink Heather  revealed in her latest post, the busiest night for bars. I took advantage of this neighborhood camaraderie by visiting the closest thing I have to a "local" -- the Harp & Bard in Dorchester. My roommate Frank and I kicked off the extended weekend by scarfing down their award-winning BLTs and washing it all down with a couple of beers.   My sister Julie and I spent Thanksgiving at Aunt Linda and Uncle Bobby's house in nearby Stoneham. Also attending the festivities were their two sons -- my cousins -- Brendan and Ryan (who are probably the nicest two people I've ever met in my life), my Uncle Jack and Aunt Elaine and their son -- another cousin -- Steve. Steve is a nice guy but doesn't talk much. You may recall he was mentioned briefly in my video game tribute post, "Forgive the Overwhelming Rush of Nostalgia." Steve, by the way, has spent the last few years designing a video game. After much prodding by family members (excluding myself, who felt kind of bad for the guy), Steve finally gave in and went online to show us some screen shots of the nearly-completed war strategy game, which looked quite impressive. He's submitted the game to a company for possible publishing, so keep your fingers crossed.   The food was excellent. That's a given. If there's anything my mother's side of the family can claim -- besides incomprehensible Boston accents -- it's a flair for cooking. As great as the food was, however, I have to say that the highlight of the day was a surprise phone call from Liza, who as most of you know is nearing the end of her three-month semester abroad in Holland. Yay Liza! Seventeen more days.   Unfortunately, by the end of the day I started getting a sore throat and was almost positive that I was in the beginning stages of a cold. As fate would have it, I woke up the next morning with just that. Originally planning to spend a couple hours working some overtime at Borders, I stayed in bed all day, which was quite all right by me, since TLC was airing a   urlLink "What Not To Wear"  Don't Dress Like a Turkey Thanksgiving Marathon. I watched the damn thing for eight hours straight. No kidding. All due respect to  urlLink The Fab Five,  I have to say that I enjoy "What Not To Wear" more. Co-host Stacy is cute as a button and her better half, Clinton, wears the coolest shirts. Before I settled in for this marathon, I also caught bits and pieces of a James Bond marathon on the silly, testosterone-fueled Spike channel. That's what I love about the holidays: marathons everywhere!  Saturday and Sunday saw me working oodles of overtime at Borders, which will be a great help to me when I have to pay for that gargantuan phone bill. No more phone calls to Holland for me, no thank you. The project I was tasked with at the store gave me the opportunity to take home a buttload-and-a-half of free CDs. I managed to grab discs from artists as diverse as Shirley Horn, Dave Holland, John Coltrane, Mars Volta, Los Straitjackets, Accentus, Leonard Bernstein and a few others I can't think of right now. Free stuff is fun!  I also caught a film Saturday night with a co-worker. We saw  urlLink "Shattered Glass,"  a great little true story indie film about Stephen Glass, a young writer for the New Republic who comes under fire after he's suspected of fabricating stories. Hayden Christiansen, aka Young Darth Vader, plays the charismatic young crook with amazing believability and the film captures the politics of journalism better than anything I've seen since  urlLink "All the President's Men."  Highly recommended.

       the dream   I had a very vivid, emotional, and rather sad dream last night.   For some reason, the dream reminded me a lot of the film  urlLink "Far From Heaven,"  perhaps because it deals with social repression in 1950s suburbia.   In the dream, I'm the young son (probably about 12 years old) of a businessman and his bored housewife, again, sometime in the late 1950s. One day -- I forget exactly how it happens -- the housewife (my mom) meets some sort of military officer and they begin to have a relationship. I know about the relationship, but I don't blow mom's cover because she seems to really love this guy and dad doesn't seem to give her the time of day.   One evening, dad comes home early and unexpectedly, so the "boyfriend" (who's at our house at the time) is introduced as an aquaintance, nothing more. This doesn't seem to faze dad, even when the lipstick on the boyfriend's shirt is lamely explained away as "ketchup."   Boyfriend then excuses himself, saying that he must catch a transport back to his base (somewhere in Asia, I think). Mom is sad because she's not able to say goodbye "properly," since dad is standing right there. Once the boyfriend is gone, dad suggests the three of us go out to dinner.   After dinner, we return home, where mom seems to be in better spirits about the situation in general. Just as we get ready to settle in for the night, The doorbell rings. It's some sort of detective (or FBI agent or something). He asks us if we know the officer/boyfriend (he says the guy's name, but I honestly don't remember it). My mom says yes, but is close to tears because she knows the news can't be good. The detective said that he found our home through the boyfriend's phone records and was sorry to have to tell us that our friend's plane crashed over the Pacific Ocean.   Mom faints. The detective starts crying because he knew the man personally.   Then I woke up.   This dream has stuck with me for the past five hours (when I woke up), probably because it was so clear to me, and because it didn't really seem too far-fetched. This is a story that could actually happen. I don't know about you, but normally my dreams are somewhere in  urlLink David Lynch  mode -- what little I can actually remember doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But this one was very sad and very clear.

       oscar blathering   The 2003 Oscar nominations were announced earlier this week, and apart from a few of the usual gripes, I'm pretty happy with the variety of big names and little indies that could. All in all, a pretty eclectic bunch of films. Roger Ebert wrote a great little  urlLink article  that, in many ways, sums up my feelings about this year's nominees.   Having said that, here's a few of my complaints:  Paul Giamatti was not nominated for best actor in "American Splendor." Huh? I don't get it. Critics were practically guaranteeing him a nomination when the film was released last fall. And with good reason: he was damn good. A friend of mine pointed out that Giamatti is still known primarily as a character actor, and a best actor nomination is a bit too much of a leap at this point. But as long as he keeps acting this good in films of this quality, he should have no problems being recognized by the academy sometime in the future ("American Splendor," by the way, comes out on DVD next Tuesday. I highly recommend you rent it as soon as possible).  Audrey Tautou was another glaring omission, as far as I'm concerned. Her performance as a troubled illegal immigrant in London was one of the best things about the fantastic (but little-seen) "Dirty Pretty Things." Of course, I don't know a whole lot of other people who saw this movie, which makes commiserating about it equally frustrating. Stephen Frears' gritty film about black market organ donation in the sleazy back streets of London was one of this year's hidden gems. Lots of critical acclaim, but no nominations, except for a well-deserved one for original screenplay. I've singled out Tautou because she not only managed to avoid being stereotyped as a cute, dimply French waitress (as she played in "Amelie"), but she also pulled off the unique task of being French and speaking English with a Turkish accent. Let's see some of you try that.   Val Kilmer in "Wonderland." Once again, this is a movie nobody (but me) saw. And actually, the critics weren't particularly kind to it. One thing that did stand out (even with the critics) was Kilmer's sublime performance as strung-out porn star John Holmes in this true story of a drug deal that turns into a bloodbath in the Hollywood hills. As he continues to step away from mainstream roles, Kilmer is proving time and time again that he's a force to be reckoned with.  Peter Sarsgaard in "Shattered Glass." There was some Oscar buzz about this role, but nothing came of it. Pity. Sarsgaard played the boss of Stephen Glass in this true story about a reporter who fabricates stories while writing for the New Republic. His performance was perfectly understated, at first trusting and standing by his young protege and slowly losing faith in the reporter as evidence piles up against him. It would have been nice to see recognition for this kind of role when most Oscar nominations seem reserved for hysterical, over-the-top scenery chewing.   Albert Finney in "Big Fish." Finney's been nominated more times than I care to look up, but has never taken home the Oscar. He's one of today's most versatile elder statesmen. He can play an eccentric Belgian sleuth, a tough-as-nails mobster, or a self-defeating alcoholic ("Murder on the Orient Express," "Miller's Crossing," "Under the Volcano," respectively) but can't seem to take home the ultimate statue. His performance as the dying storyteller in Tim Burton's beautiful fantasy epic was, in my opinion, one of his finest in a long line of excellent roles.   My predictions? I'm working on it. When I know, you'll know.

       that "other " awards show   Anyone catch the  urlLink Golden Globes  last night? Really? Me neither. I'm an unabashed Oscar-holic (Liza and I catch them faithfully every year), but I never bother with the Globes. I never really approved of the whole separate-categories-for-comedies-and-dramas thing, and I hate the fact that television is recognized as well.   Having said that, I am supremely happy beyond belief that  urlLink "The Office"  took home the trophy for best comedy, beating out same-old, same-old like "Will & Grace" and "Sex and the City." Also, the show's creator and star, Ricky Gervais, won a much-deserved best actor award. Bloody 'ell, that's brilliant!  In other good news, it seems that Bill Murray won a best actor award for my favorite film of 2003, the wonderful  urlLink "Lost in Translation."  However, my second-favorite film of the year,   urlLink "Dirty Pretty Things,"  received no nominations. For anything. Let's hope the Oscar nominations are different in that respect.

       let's talk shop   I've spent the last couple of hours continuing to teach myself  urlLink Adobe Premiere Pro,  which has actually yielded some positive results. It's a rather complicated path that has led me to become my office's digital video archivist/editor/mainpulator, but let's just say that seven years as a navy broadcast journalist (which included, among many other things, lots of video editing) in addition to a year doing nothing but video editing at a television station in Virginia had something to do with it.   The problem is, when it comes to video editing skills, I'm strictly old-school. Give me a pile of professional beta tapes, a couple of Sony editing machines (player and recorder), and I'm your man. The closest I ever came to anything slightly more high-tech than that was when the broadcasting facility in Iceland (where I spent three-and-a-half glorious years) acquired an ACE 25 video production center, which I didn't get to use very much, since it was mainly a tool of our newly minted "video production department" (basically Peter Watson and  urlLink Terry Welch  producing some very clever PSAs that perpetuated their reputation as rebellious geniuses).   At any rate, the point is that I'm learning this thing virtually by myself, which can be frustrating, but whenever I cross a hurdle and am able to accomplish a particularly tricky feat, the feeling is pretty nice. Armed with a slightly embarrassing  urlLink book  that has actually proven to be quite useful, I've managed to complete a rather basic, no frills mini-project. Yay! No fancy edits involved, altough I did manage to stick ten seconds of  urlLink color bars  at the beginning to show that I mean business. Shameless.

       music update   Picked up two excellent CDs over the weekend. First, in the continuing effort to rebuild my Miles Davis collection following my 2001 burglary, I finally re-purchased the lovely reissue of  urlLink "Sketches of Spain."  This album bothered me quite a bit when I first bought it in 1993. In the early nineties, I began a healthy obsession with jazz, and enjoyed other Miles albums like "Kind of Blue" and "Round About Midnight." But "Sketches of Spain threw me for a loop.  This can be a tough album to love. It's dissonant, slow, and not exactly the improvisational hard bop that was Miles' bread and butter in the forties and fifties. Collaborating once again with legendary arranger Gil Evans, "Sketches" shows Miles embracing a heavily orchestrated, Spanish-flavored sound. I wouldn't even characterize this as a jazz album. It sounds more like a classical film score. It took me several years (around 2000 or 2001, I think) before I really sat down and gave it a hard listen. What it lacks in the more familiar jazz sounds it more than makes up for with a lush, truly original feel.   A new series entitled "Under the Influence" began surfacing last year that has me very interested. Each volume is a collection of favorite songs and influences by a particular artist. Previous releases included collections from Morrissey and former Stone Roses vocalist Ian Brown. Earlier this month, the Paul Weller  urlLink "Under the Influence"  disc was released, and of course I had to buy it.   One thing I've always known about Weller was reinforced by the track list of this collection -- the man has impeccable, not to mention eclectic, taste in music. The whole thing starts with Little Richard's "Slippin' and Slidin'" and includes experimental jazz (Charles Mingus' "Passions of a Man," John Coltrane's "Ole"), reggae (the Wailers' "Small Axe," Big Youth's "Hit the Road Jack," John Holt's "Ali Baba"), obscure sixties pop (the Kinks' "Big Black Smoke," the Casuals' gorgeous "Jesamine") contemporary funk and hip-hop (D'Angelo's "Devil's Pie" and Funkdoobiest's "Doobie to the Head") and much more. It's as if Paul Weller made a mix tape for you. Oh, and there's liner notes from the man himself. I hope they continue this series, but Weller's collection will be hard to top.

       book update   One of my goals this year is to get back to reading more books. Right now I'm in a bit of a mystery streak. Last week I finished  urlLink "Noise Abatement,"  a thriller by a Scottish author named Carol Anne Davis, about a young couple who are deprived of sleep and sanity by their upstairs neighbors from hell, and decide to take matters into their own hands. The book was pretty enjoyable, but the ending was depressing as hell.   Monday night I started reading  urlLink "The Conspiracy Club"  by Jonathan Kellerman and I really love it. I'm really not sure where the book is headed at this point (I'm on page 76), but that's a good thing. I feel that movies and books are best enjoyed when you have no idea what the hell is going on (which is why I tend to avoid those spoiler-heavy Amazon reader reviews). I've read three Kellerman books in the past ("The Web," "The Clinic" and "Bad Love") and they were all very good.

       life after phoenix: back in my town   What a busy week. Not on this blog, of course. I'm sure you've seen the tumbleweeds passing through here from time to time.   Liza and I returned from Phoenix late Monday night -- two hours later than originally scheduled, in fact. Our flight landed at 12:30 am, but our baggage was among the first pieces to tumble onto the carousel, followed by a hop, skip and jump to the taxi stand and the next thing you know -- we're home in bed by 1 am. Not bad at all.   Wednesday saw Liza -- with the help of a hastily rented U-Haul -- move into her new apartment virtually by herself (I couldn't get any more time off work). That night I helped her cart several thousand boxes from the building's stairwell into her fourth floor apartment. It's a bit tiny and kind of old, but it's in Boston's lovely North End. Those of you from out of town who are unfamiliar with this particular neighborhood -- it's a quaint, very Italian section of Boston with tons of great restaurants, a great  urlLink comedy club  (where Liza works part-time) and easy access to most of downtown Boston (including Liza's  urlLink school ). It's also a bit of a tourist trap -- you can tell the tourists pretty easily from the locals, though. They're the ones clutching the  urlLink Mike's Pastry  boxes.   Over the last couple of days I've been busy at my  urlLink real job,  working on a media highlights video for a trustee meeting. Unfortunately, I'm using  urlLink Adobe Premiere Pro,  which is a great system...if I only knew what the hell I was doing. I'm learning, though. Slowly.  I guess I can't be a Boston blogger without an obligatory post about our recent cold weather. But I share  urlLink Stacey's  attitude: buck up and deal with it. It's New England. I really wish our local TV newscasters would stop spending so much damn time talking about how cold it is. We know it's cold. It's winter time. Put on a hat, scarf and glvoes and live your life already.   Cool CD purchases of the week: Frank Zappa's  urlLink "Grand Wazoo"  (an album I've heard many, many times, courtesy of my brother's vinyl copy, but never owned until this week -- probably my favorite of his jazz-oriented stuff) and  urlLink "Blackberry Belle,"  the latest from the Twilight Singers (former Afghan Whigs frontman Greg Dulli's newest band -- dark and funky). Both highly recommended.   Enjoy your three-day weekend.

       at this time, i have no comment   You may have noticed that the "comments" feature on my blog has been disabled. It's not my idea -- believe me, I want to read all about what you wonderful people have to say -- it's actually a hosting issue with Blogspeak, the site that provides the comment service. The Blogspeak site explained in an understandably cranky missive that the site's account has been suspended indefinitely (the words "bastards," "bullshit" and "douchebag" were all used in the explanation/apology, so I guess there's some hard feelings between site and host).   In the meantime, I'm shopping around for other free comment services. Drop me a line if you know of a good one. If you have something to tell me -- regarding comment services or anything, for that matter -- e-mail me. I read all e-mail that doesn't mention penis enlargement, debt relief or splitting bank account proceeds with a Nigerian stranger in the subject line.

       good news about depressing swedish films (and depressing news about good swedish actors)   Good news first: Criterion is releasing Ingmar Bergman's excellent  urlLink "Scenes From a Marriage"  on DVD in March.   And now, the bad news: Ingrid Thulin, a Swedish actress best-known for her appearances in such Bergman films as "Wild Strawberries," "Winter Light" and the brutal "Cries and Whispers," has  urlLink died.

       a few things i learned during my trip to phoenix   If Liza and I actually do decide to move to Phoenix one day, we would probably go broke shopping at  urlLink AJ's.   Lizas brother-in-law Roger sucks at pool just as much as I do, and thats why I enjoy playing pool with him so much.    urlLink Target  is a great place to people-watch.    urlLink Bill Hicks  CDs in my Walkman are the ultimate antidote to my fear of flying.   After scoring a 90 on the Entertainment Weekly Pop Culture Quiz, Ive concluded that I know way too much about nothing.   I love animals. Seriously. Dogs were always fun when I was a kid, but over the last several months Ive noticed that many of my friends, family and co-workers are huge animal lover and its rubbed off on me in a big way. When I see a dog or cat in a magazine or walking down the street, I get all dorky and say stuff like what a nice doggie! in a really dumb voice. The fact that Lizas parents and sister each own a dog has really reinforced that for me over the past week.   The  urlLink Discovery Times Channel  is really, really cool.

       revelations in the desert   It's now day four-and-a-half of my latest Arizona vacation. A little less than 48 hours left. It's really amazing how much my stress level drops when I'm here. I realize that at least some of that has to do with the fact that I'm not working when I'm here, but I still contend that the lack of urban congestion and stressed-out city life is to blame as well. Liza and I both tend to get conflicted about our suburban feelings whenever we're here. Read my July 1, 2003 blog entry, "The Confused Urbanite," for more details on that subject.   Don't get me wrong, I love the city. I always have. I even love the cold, crappy weather out there. But warm suburbia certainly has its advantages as well.  Am I just getting old? I don't know.

       an update from phoenix, if you're interested   Yesterday was our first full day in Phoenix since Liza and I arrived here for our vacation. First things first: check out the  urlLink Elephant Bar,  a nice restaurant -- actually a chain -- that has a few locations in the Phoenix area. Great food, big portions and broad, friendly Southwestern service. Liza and I went there for a late lunch with Nancy, our former boss at Borders in Boston who now lives out here (and works at a shiny new Borders in North Scottsdale). I had the Bahama Burger, while Liza and Nancy had salads. We had fun catching up and bitching about Borders management politics.   Liza and I also made ourselves a huge breakfast and capped off the morning by sitting down at Liza's piano (an upright located at her parent's house which she opted not to drag to Boston with her when she moved there in 1999)  while she learned a couple of songs that were on mix discs I made for her during her recent semester in Europe: "Take Down the Union Jack" by Billy Bragg and "Hot on the Heels of Heartbreak" by the Beautiful South. She also played Warren Zevon's "Don't Let Us Get Sick" (which she learned in Europe) while I performed barely passing harmonica accompaniment. I'm no harmonica player, but the instrument -- in the key of C, like the song itself -- was fairly easy to play, in a quasi-dissonant Bob Dylan way.

       giving away the plot   Good morning, loyal readers (and the not-so-loyal ones).   Liza and I have been in Phoenix since late last night. A long day of packing and flying was capped off (rather nicely, I must say), by a brief dip in her parents' jaccuzzi. As much as I hate flying, being out here is certainly worth the trip. I've been in Phoenix in January before (three years ago), and I guess I forgot that it wasn't going to be as hot as usual. It's 8:30 in the morning and the temperature is a brisk 48 degrees. Still, it beats the deep-freeze that Boston is getting ready to experience.   I haven't been buying a whole lot of music lately, what with my rent due last week and the aftermath of Christmas putting a slight hold on extracurricular purchases. But I have attempted some sort of New Year's resolution when it comes to books: I'm going to read more of them. A long time ago (before I put a television set in my bedroom), I read a lot of books. Mostly fiction, nothing terribly challenging, but I enjoyed -- and still enjoy -- the simple pleasures of plowing through a good story.   Over the last couple of years, instead of making specific resolutions, I basically tell myself that I am going to treat myself better, mentally and physically. I can treat my body better by doing more exercise, and I can give the brain a good workout by reading more books. Less time in front of the television and more time reading. Listen to me, berating myself. It's official. I've become my own parent.   Anyhoo, last weekend Liza and I made a brief stop at  urlLink McIntyre & Moore,  a great, huge used bookstore in Porter Square, and while I wasn't planning on buying anything, I caved and picked up  urlLink "Noise Abatement,"  a mystery by a Scottish writer named Carol Anne Davis. It's a great little story about a young couple who are sleep-deprived by upstairs neighbors from hell and decide to take matters into their own hands. Fun!  I also managed to get my hands on John Irving's  urlLink "The Water-Method Man,"  which I was inspired to pick up after Liza started reading Irving's  urlLink "A Widow For One Year"  (a choice influenced by her mother, a big John Irving fan). Once I'm finished with "Noise Abatement," I'll give John a try, since I really need to expand my literary horizons beyond mysteries and books by Nick Hornby and Jay McInerney.   Speaking of mysteries, I finally finished  urlLink "Mission Flats,"  which I've been reading off and on for almost a month. Not that it wasn't a good book -- I quite liked it -- but again, I'm having problems carving out reading time for myself. It's quite an easy task to accomplish, really -- just turn off the damn TV once in a while. "Mission Flats" will inevitably draw comparisons to  urlLink "Mystic River,"  since they're both about murders in Boston. Well, actually, the murder in "Mission Flats" takes place in Maine, with the ensuing investigation taking place in Boston. Whatever. If you like "Mystic River," there's a good chance you'll like this one too.   All this pontificating is making me hungry. It's breakfast time.

       by the time I get to phoenix   Tomorrow afternoon Liza and I will be boarding a plane for Phoenix, where we will spend six days hanging out with her family. Her parents' pool isn't heated, so it won't be warm enough for  that,  but it'll be perfect hot tob weather.   I really need this vacation.   Chances are, I'll probably do one or two blog posts while I'm there, but for the most part I'll try to stay away from computers.

       where have all the good times gone?   Okay, so first, Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson is arrested after allegedly roughing up a rent-a-cop during a drunken New Year's Eve party.   Now it appears that legendary Kinks frontman Ray Davies was  urlLink shot  in New Orleans after he and his girlfriend were mugged. This is definitely going to be one kooky 2004 for rock stars.   By the way, Davies was recently made a  urlLink Commander of the British Empire.  Are these events related? Is there an anti-Royal Family faction operating in Louisiana?   Actually, I think  urlLink Keith Richards  has some explaining to do. Does he even have an alibi?

       slogans mean nothing   You may have noticed that the little motto that used to be under "pressure drop" at the top of this blog ("Views and reviews. Don't take any of this personally") has been replaced by something new. Taking a blogging style tip from  urlLink Adam,  I'm going to periodically replace the little slogan with various nonsensical phrases, usually from favorite song lyrics. The first one I used, "With Everything To Lose," is the name of a song by the Style Council. The latest one ("Pretending to be pilots in a war. Pretending to weave between the flak") is a line from "The Light Is Always Green," a song by the Housemartins that made my most recent list of "ten totally random really good songs" (see below). For some reason, I've always loved that line.

       in your ear   2004 is starting out pretty strangely for me -- yesterday morning I woke up with my right ear all blocked up and it won't go away. How strange is that?  It's as if my right ear needs to "pop," but won't. I'd love to go to the doctor, but my "doctor" situation is a little confusing right now: I had a primary care provider at a hospital in Malden (where I used to live), but in the nearly two years since I've been to the doctor, I've moved and Malden is hardly convenient for me. So I need to find a new provider, preferably in closer proximity to where I work. That all takes paperwork and phone calls to people who are probably still on vacation. In the meantime, Liza has reassured me that it's probably just "fluid that needs to come out." That's all well and good, but how is this fluid planning on making its exit? My guess is, it will come out when it's good and ready. In the meantime, could you please speak up? I don't hear so good out of this ear.   2004 is already proving to be an entertaining year for misbehaving rock stars, too. The guitarist of one of my favorite bands from junior high school who I still like even though it's not really cool to like them anymore  urlLink has been arrested.  I never in a million years could have predicted this.

       listening and reading   In my last post (three days ago), I indicated that this week was starting out quite nicely. Well, it hasn't necessarily turned into a  bad  week...just a boring one. Seriously. Nothing's going on right now. Some boring work stuff, but nothing to write about. Literally.   Those of you who follow my unusually out-of-character obsession with 70s  urlLink prog rock  will be happy to know that I purchased one of the three new  urlLink Yes  reissues that came out this week. The latest in  urlLink Rhino's  reissue batch are  urlLink "Tormato,"   urlLink "Drama"  and  urlLink "90125."  I haven't heard "Tormato" since my brother bought it about 25 years ago, but I've yet to hear anything positive about it. "90125" was mildly interesting when it was released back in 1983, but it sounds laughably dated today. So I picked up "Drama," which is an unusual release in that it's the only Yes album that doesn't feature Jon Anderson on vocals (he was temporarily replaced by former Buggles vocalist Trevor Horn on this 1980 album). The songs sound a lot like what you would expect from Yes -- there's a few long numbers, like the dark, almost King Crimson-esque "Machine Messiah" -- in addition to some shorter, more pop-oriented stuff that shows them leaning toward the "90125" sound of that would follow three years later, but still quite listenable. The bonus tracks feature some interesting instrumental noodling and single edits, in addition to some demos that were recorded in Paris just before Anderson and keyboard player Rick Wakeman jumped ship. It's a good thing these songs were never completed, because they sound pretty horrible. Still, good for a laugh.   Although I found a lot to like about it, I eventually ditched David Mitchell's  urlLink "Ghostwritten"  last night since it was taking me an infuriatingly long time to finish. I decided instead to read some brain candy thriller stuff for a little while, so I started  Brad Meltzer's  urlLink "The Zero Game,"  (I snagged a free copy of at Borders a couple of months ago). By the way, has anyone read Chuck Klosterman's  urlLink "Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs,"  the follow-up to his brilliant  urlLink "Fargo Rock City?"  I'm thinking of reading that next.

       ...and they put him in a suit of lights   So far, this is turning out to be quite a nice week. Why? Well, as of this morning I have tickets to see  urlLink Elvis Costello  this Friday night at the  urlLink Wang Center!  Yay! I love Elvis!  Last night I got a voicemail message from my sister Julie, who asked me if I was interesting in seeing Elvis. I sort of wrote off that concert months ago back in December (I think) when the tickets first went on sale. I didn't have the money at the time, and I knew it would sell out instantly. But this morning I checked the Wang's website and lo and behold, I was able to procure three tickets, a mere four days before showtime! Okay, so they're left orchestra, row "T," but hey -- I'm in the building. It's Liza, Julie and me. And Julie's buying me my ticket for an early birthday present! It just gets better and better.   This will be my fourth time seeing Elvis in concert, and the interesting thing is that all of these shows (the future one included) are of different musical configurations. The first time I saw him, in April 1987, it was a solo acoustic college tour (with the amazing  urlLink Nick Lowe  opening up); in June 1999 I saw him at Suffolk Downs as the headliner for the Guinness Fleadh Festival, accompanied by pianist Steve Nieve; last July I caught him at the Fleet Pavillon with "The Imposters," which is basically the Attractions with Davey Faragher replacing Bruce Thomas on bass. This time around, Elvis will be once again joined by Nieve, along with the  urlLink Brodsky Quartet,  who collaborated with Elvis on his 1993 album  urlLink "The Juliet Letters."    Judging by the classy instrumentation, it seems as if the focus will be on his latest album, last year's "North," which you can listen to here:   urlLink     And that's fine with me. "North" is a beautiful album, and the swanky Wang Center is just the place. Am I happy? You bet your ass I am.

       greetings from emerson   Since I currently don't have a computer of my own, about 95 percent of my blog posting takes place at the office. Tonight is an exception. Liza is attending a meeting with some fellow students regarding a project they're working on, so I took her up on her offer of coming in from the relative cold and signing me in to the building. I'm currently in the library. I feel like...such a  student.  Without having to do the actual work, that is.  Big chunks of my day have been spent aimlessly exploring the city, while Liza has been off fulfilling various obligations. This morning in her apartment, we pored over the Sunday edition of the  urlLink Boston Globe  (which we now both subscribe to) and watched "Meet the Press" (where Governor Terminator once again proved his inability to answer direct questions about the fucked-up nature of California's budget, and Ralph Nader announced that he would once again fuck up the chances of getting a non-Republican in the office by running for president and splitting the Democratic voters -- thanks, Ralph!). We also had waffles, coffee, orange juice and the greatest eggs I've ever tasted (courtesy of Liza) while watching "Trading Spaces."  Liza went to a dance rehearsal while I took advantage of our fairly new  urlLink Museum of Fine Arts  memberships and wandered around the museum, enjoying...well, you know, "art." The MFA is indeed a wonderful place and I'm so happy that my sister Julie got dual memeberships for Liza and I for Christmas. Yay Julie! In addition to the artwork, I also spent some time "just chillin'" in perhaps one of my favorite locations in the entire city of Boston -- the Japanese Temple Room. What a nice, serene, relaxing, beautiful little place.  I also visited one of my favorite  urlLink Starbucks  locations -- the one on Beacon Street that's near the Bull & Finch Pub. This morning, my mild frustration over a lack of bath mats in Liza's new bathroom forced me to promise to buy her some as a late housewarming present. Visits to Marshalls and T.J. Maxx in Downtown Crossing proved fruitless, but a trip to  urlLink Target  later this week could yield positive results. Aren't you glad you're reading all of this?   Tonight I believe that dinner at my apartment, followed by a viewing of a show we've both missed for an unusually long period of time ("Law & Order: Criminal Intent") is in order. I hope your Sunday has been as relaxing, overcast, culturally enlightening and completely  Sunday-ish  as mine.

       the hurt and the anger and the joy of the pain   Having a  horrible song stuck in your head can be an infuriating thing. But having a really  good  song in there -- which doesn't happen nearly as often -- can be wonderful, like your head is tuned into some cool radio station programmed just for you. Ever since about 8 a.m., I've had "Black Coffee in Bed" by  urlLink Squeeze  stuck in my head, and it's had such a nice effect on my day that I've even used the song's title as my latest "blog tag."  It all started this morning, on my way to work, when I decided to put Squeeze's excellent greatest hits disc,  urlLink "Singles: 45s and Under,"  on my Walkman. I realized once again how incredible this selection of songs really is, how much I love Squeeze, and how indelibly this album changed my musical tastes in the summer of 1985.  "Singles..." is a great introduction to Squeeze, but please don't stop there. "East Side Story" is a fantastic album (produced by Elvis Costello) and it includes not only the famous "Tempted," but 13 more terrific songs as well (15 more if you buy the import reissue version).   Have a spiffy weekend.

       dude, where's my payday?   I'm a bonehead. I spent my last ten bucks at the movies last night, thinking I was getting paid today -- which makes sense, since I normally get paid on Thursdays. What I failed to remember was that whenever we have a Monday holiday (like this week), payday gets moved to Friday. I was going to get some money from the ATM and eat lunch at   urlLink Bruegger's  or maybe grab a sandwich at  urlLink 7-11,  but unfortunately our twisted holiday payroll schedule will make sure none of that takes place. Usually I have an emergency  urlLink Soup at Hand  in my desk, but I think I used the last one a few weeks ago when I was too lazy to leave the office for lunch.   So, to sum up: I'm stupid. And hungry.

       it's like pixar on acid   I suppose that's one way to describe  urlLink "The Triplets of Belleville,"  which I finally saw with Liza, Zoe and Suarez last night. Roger Ebert practically gave himself a hernia trying to aptly describe it in  urlLink his review.  You know those non-dialogue animated shorts they show before Pixar films, like "Luxo, Jr." or "Geri's Game?" Imagine a French full-length version with old-school animation, and you've got the general idea. It's amazing. Check it out.

       a note to the mutiplex crowd   I try not to become addicted to prime time TV shows. I only watch a couple of them, and I think that's more than enough. Lately, however, I've become a fan of  urlLink "CSI: Miami,"  a rather well-written show, despite its annoying tendency to be too superficially slick for its own good (which is why I love  urlLink "Law & Order"  --  no frills, just tell me the story). I also love David Caruso's quirky character, with all the weird speech inflections ("this...is NOT an ACCIDENT...").   But anyway, I was watching it last night and the Caruso character made a reference to  urlLink "Blowup,"  Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 cinematic masterpiece. Predictably, one of Caruso's pretty-boy technicians shrugged and mumbled, "never heard of it."  AAAARRRGGHHH!! Once again, I must vent my frustration at how little attention today's moviegoer pays to our celluloid past. I can understand, maybe, if you've never seen this movie. But never even heard of it? Meanwhile, "50 First Dates" continues to break box-office records.   I normally don't care for movie reviews that take the form of "fake" letters to the editor or "imaginary" interviews with the film's star or director (neither does Tom at unproductivity.com -- his outrage at Pitchfork Media's condescending review of Metallica's "St. Anger" prompted some of the  urlLink his best blogging moments ).   I will make an exception in the case of dvdjournal.com's recent  urlLink review  of "Blowup" (which is being released on DVD today for the very first time). Read and enjoy. Then go buy the damn thing. Most places are only selling it for $14.99.

       confessions of a former expatriate   Yesterday was the five-year anniversary of my return to Boston, after three years in Italy, eighteen months in Virginia and seven years in the navy. Prior to that, I spent my high school years in Florida. So my return to civilian life in the city of my birth, while without fanfare or ticker-tape parades, was a big deal to me. I was both excited and terrified at the prospect of being completely independent, having to find a job and an apartment virtually by myself (with some valuable help from my family, of course), without the navy footing any of the bill (my years in Italy were "civil service" and I spent a small part of them still married to a military member -- I was also a "navy wife," so to speak, while in Virginia).   After some rocky starts, I think things have worked out quite nicely. I have one and a half decent jobs, a wonderful girlfriend whom I love very very much, and although I no longer have the shithole Malden apartment to myself, I am sharing a rather comfortable apartment with a co-worker.   Five years, lots of changes. I wonder what I'll be up to in 2009.

       jack, diane and the architect   Two more movies were crossed off the list over the weekend. Sunday night, after realizing that the last two movies we saw ("Monster" and "21 Grams") were thoroughly depressing (yet very good), Liza and I -- in the spirit of "Valentine's Weekend" -- caught  urlLink "Something's Gotta Give."  The film does in fact fit into my "February Oscar Marathon" criteria, since Diane Keaton was nominated for Best Actress. Did I like the film? Sure, it was fun and I laughed a lot. Did Diane Keaton deserve the nomination? I think so, although I doubt she's going to beat Charlize Theron. I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but the film did little to sway my belief that Keanu Reeves can't act, although he  was  playing a bit of an airhead, so I guess you could say he was good for the part.  Yesterday afternoon, Liza attended a meeting at school to discuss a project, so I headed to the wonderful  urlLink Kendall Square Cinema  to see a wonderful film:  urlLink "My Architect."  See this film. Trust me. It's amazing. It's a documentary about Louis Kahn, an eccentric architect who died of a heart attack in 1974. Besides leaving a wife, he also left two mistresses with whom he fathered a child apiece. One of these children, Nathaniel Kahn, decided to make a film about his long-lost father and in the process, learned a lot about this unusual and elusive man. Many of his interview subjects -- co-workers, employees, family members, fellow architects -- are not shy about expressing their contempt for this oddball curmudgeon, but they almost all agree that he was a groundbreaking genius. Nathaniel ends up with a reverent yet realistic portrait of his father. Deep-six the blockbuster crowd and treat yourself to this simple yet winning film.

I'm equally glad to see that the track list does  not  contain "Kicking Television," a rather horrible new song they recently previewed on  urlLink "Austin City Limits."

       get your hands off my purple cotton candy machine   I had the freakiest dream Sunday night. I was a last-minute replacement singer for a 70s funk-punk band that was playing at an enormous outdoor wedding at some bigshot mansion. We were sort of like  urlLink Outkast  meets  urlLink Parliament-Funkadelic  meets the  urlLink Ramones.  This band, whatever it was called, was the shit back in the day. Now they just do weddings, I guess. Anyway, our big showstopping number was "Get Your Hands Off My Purple Cotton Candy Machine." When I woke up, I did something I've never done before...I wrote about my dream in a notebook that was near my bed. I just wish I had a tape recorder to sing the "Cotton Candy" song, because it definitely had a chorus and a melody.    urlLink Mike Keneally  has said in the past that the songs that he "dreams" are usually the dorky ones (two cases in point: "Good Morning, Sometime" and "I Guess I'll Peanut"). I suppose I'm no different in this case.

       friday afternoon brain dump   I listened to  urlLink the new autumn defense album  in its entirety for the first time last night. I still like it a lot (I raved about it here a couple of days ago), but I think they overdo those killer 70s harmonies just a wee bit. Still, nice album.   I surfed around  urlLink Wil Wheaton's blog  for a while this afternoon after seeing so many people linking to it for so long. Everyone seems to either love or hate this guy. I think he's a good writer and generally quite entertaining, but I get the distinct impression that he's a little self-obsessed. Then again, blogs are all about self-obsession, aren't they?  Liza's hosting a fancy wine-and-cheese soiree at her apartment tonight. Have I mentioned how cool the friends Liza made during  urlLink her semester abroad  are? How about the awkwardness of that last sentence? Have I mentioned how awkward it is? Well it is. And the friends? Very cool. Hopefully, once the wine kicks in, we can loosen the neckties and boogie. I'm bringing along some music and I plan on turning that mother out.   Any plans for Valentine's Day? Liza and I have reservations to  urlLink this  swanky place. Now that Liza actually lives in the North End, we're going to try as many of the Italian restaurants in that neighborhood as possible. And believe me, there's a lot of 'em.   I bought the  urlLink "American Splendor"  DVD eight days ago, but still haven't watched anything but the "featurette." I'm waiting for a time when Liza and I can watch it together because I know she's going to love it. Have I mentioned yet that it's a crying shame  urlLink Paul Giamatti  wasn't nominated for an Oscar? Cryin' shame, I tell ya.   No plans yet for President's Day, but TNT is airing a  urlLink Law & Order Marathon,  so the idea of laying in bed, sipping coffee and watching Briscoe cuff 'em and McCoy fry 'em sounds like as good a plan as any.   The office is simply not a productive one this afternoon, and as a result I'm being given the green light to take off early. So I will. Thanks for reading. Don't forget to leave a comment if the mood strikes you. Oh, and  urlLink here's  a website with lots of cute doggie pictures (thanks,  urlLink April! ).

       holla!   My comments section is back, thanks to the wonderful folks at  urlLink Haloscan.  Thanks also to  urlLink Dan  and  urlLink Heather  for giving me valuable "comment" advice, whether they realize it or not. Thanks also to the Academy. And my agent. It's an honor just to be nominated.   And while I'm on the subject of "comments," I'd like to ask my tiny legion of readers to take advantage of this lovely feature. Back when I was using Blogspeak, the amount of comments I received was painfully meager. That doesn't do much for the self-esteem, you know. So even if it's just a "nice post" or "I agree" or even "your blog sucks, you hack"...comment away. Thanks much.

       the autumn defense   Last night at   urlLink my part-time job,  I continued the laborious but ultimately rewarding task of changing out the music listening stations. I've taken it upon myself to be the "dude who does it" since my anal-retentive nature ensures that I do it right, and also I so that I can take home some of the promo CDs that come out of the listening station players. Last night I walked out of the store with about eight discs. Most of it was classical stuff that I won't bore you with, but one of the "pop-rock" CDs that are now in my possession is "Circles," the latest release by  urlLink the Autumn Defense.   I haven't heard the whole album yet, but what I have heard is really something. The Autumn Defense is actually John Stirratt and Pat Sansone. Stirratt is the bass player for  urlLink Wilco.  If you like Wilco (as do I, very much), you may like this disc a lot. There are definite shades of Stirratt's "other band" here, particularly the twangy experimentalism so prevalent on 2002's  urlLink "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"  but there is also a very relaxed atmosphere, as if John and Pat don't really have anything to prove. What stands out perhaps more than anything on "Circles" is the vocal harmonies, reminiscent of the Byrds, or Crosby, Stills and Nash. It's basically a laid-back Wilco crossed with 70s folk. If you're into that sort of thing.   Oh, and if you're a Bostonite and want to catch the Autumn Defense in concert, they're performing at  urlLink T.T. the Bear's  in Cambridge this Friday. I'll be attending a soiree at Liza's place that night, so I won't be able to go. But you should.

       not exactly family films   Over the weekend, Liza and I continued our quest to see as many of the Oscar-nominated films as possible by checking out  urlLink "Monster"  and  urlLink "21 Grams."  Severe depression, anyone?   The major buzz around "Monster" is Charlize Theron's blistering, Oscar-nominated, typcast-crushing role as hooker-cum-serial killer Aileen Watrous. It's no hype, folks. Not only is Theron visually transformed into a white-trash, bottom-feeder Florida highway hooker, her acting is sublime. All nervous ticks and amped-up desperation, she quite simply  is  this woman. Hopefully, Theron will now be able to get parts that require her to  act  instead of just standing in front of the camera looking pretty.   This is a disturbing film. I was expecting some brutal realism, but not nearly what I eventually got. There's a particularly shocking rape scene, but apart from that, what really tore me up was the fact that Watrous and her young lesbian lover, Selby (played by Christina Ricci) were so out-of-touch and naive as to assume that with a few pilfered bucks in their pockets, they could escape "the life" and infiltrate suburbia, their white-picket-fence dreams fully realized. When Aileen -- dressed in an outfit that a thrift store would probably turn down -- sits down for a law firm secretary job interview ("I know how ta operate a Rolodex," she explains), you just have to feel sorry for her. Well, until she starts killing people non-stop.   "21 Grams" was disturbing on a different level. While "Monster" was more of a character study, this film had elements of a thriller. Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ( urlLink "Amores Perros" ), the film takes its sequences and jumbles them up like jigsaw puzzle pieces (not unlike  urlLink "Memento" ), and figuring out where the pieces fit is half the fun (although it's hardly a "joyful" experience).  Eventually, the pieces start to make sense and as the story unfolds. It sounds like a gimmick -- and indeed, some critics have complained as such -- but you can't deny that it's an interesting way to keep the audience's attention.   The story revolves around three central characters -- a math professor and heart transplant recipient (Sean Penn), a woman (Naomi Watts) whose husband and two children are hit by a car, and an ex-con born-again Christian (Benicio Del Toro). A car accident brings these three very different people together, then splits them up, and are reunited again through revenge.   Watts and Del Toro were nominated for Oscars, and while I thought Watts was very good and Del Toro his usual amazing self, I was disappointed that Penn's performance wasn't given a nomination as well. I realize that his (admittedly excellent) turn as a tortured, grieving father  in   urlLink "Mystic River"  is more up Oscar's alley, but in "21 Grams" he was understated, and that's what really got my attention. I find it refreshing that the dude who played Jeff Spicoli in  urlLink "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"  is turning in brilliant, cathartic roles 20 years later.

       curled up like invertebrates   A couple of weeks ago I hit the jackpot in the free promo department at  urlLink my part-time job  with a copy of the latest John Wesley Harding album,  urlLink "Adam's Apple"  (thanks, Dave!). The album, which will be released Feb. 17, is the long-awaited follow-up to 2000's brilliant  urlLink "Confessions of St. Ace."  The new one was a bit disappointing when I first listened to it, but I spent a good deal of time reexamining it on the Walkman over the weekend (particularly during my Saturday afternoon excursion out to the  urlLink Garment District,  which, fine vintage clothing store that it is, still couldn't provide me with the pair of red pants I so desperately needed -- red pants? More on that later...).   I initially found myself constantly comparing the album to "Confessions..." and was put off by the fact that the quality of the songs on "Adam's Apple" just didn't match up to its predecessor. I still feel that way, to some degree, but the songs have definitely grown on me, to the point where I find it a highly enjoyable album (but not to the extent of AllMusic Guide critic John D. Luerssen, who called it "the finest album of his career" --  in my opinion, that distinction belongs to 1989's  urlLink "Here Comes the Groom" ).  I will agree, however, with Luerssen's assessment that it contains some of Wes' best singing to date. His voice is strong and confident, and is perfectly suited to the album's sterling production and performances. Favorite songs so far? "Nothing at All" is a slice of Beatlesque heaven. "Sussex Ghost Story" (a collaboration with classical composer Gavin Bryars)is just as haunting and beautiful as its title suggests. "Sluts" is a hilarious, funky ode to the Beautiful People. "She Never Talks" not only rocks out with some excellent guitar riffing, it's also the only song I've ever heard that makes a reference to  urlLink "Die Fledermaus."  And so on. I guess I have more favorite songs on this new album than I initially thought. Anyway, it comes out in eight days. Please buy it. And if Wes ever goes on tour, try to see him in concert. He's a talented singer and musician who also happens to be funny as hell.

       payday   I got paid yesterday (and today...having two jobs can be very rewarding), and after last week's rent check rendering me broke for several days, I decided to celebrate with some Borders purchases. Yay cashflow! Here's the skinny:  Echo and the Bunnymen:  urlLink "Ocean Rain"  I'm not a huge fan of Echo's entire output...as eighties British college rock goes, it's pretty good, but not as good as, say, the Smiths or New Order. But "Ocean Rain" (first released in 1984) is a flat-out masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned. I think I first bought the CD in 1990 or '91 and I'd have to say that it would rest comfortably in my list of top twenty favorite albums of all time.   What makes it so wonderful: first of all, the songwriting. The band manages to craft a creepy, gothic Joy Division-meets-the Cure sound, while incorporating soaring melodies and delicious hooks. Also, the production: acoustic guitars meld with tasteful strings, and Ian McCullogh's lovely, world-weary voice -- all echoey and somber -- come together to create a unique, haunting sound. This is an amazing album. Rhino has rereleased this album (in addition to the rest of the Echo catalog) with several bonus tracks, mostly live and radio station recordings. If you like the Smiths but are put off by Morrissey's self-loathing, you should check this out.   Harry Nilsson:  urlLink "Nilsson Schmilsson"  I became enamored of this album when I was about 11 years old. My Uncle Bobby and Aunt Linda owned this on vinyl and whenever my mother and I would visit their house in Stoneham, I would head down to the finished basement to watch TV and pore over their record collection. I probably just listened to "Jump Into the Fire" over and over, but I'm not sure. Nilsson was a singer-songwriter who gained a reputation for a variety of things: being named John Lennon and Paul McCartney's favorite songwriter during a Beatles press conference in the late sixties; being Lennon's drinking and carousing companion during the late Beatle's separation from Yoko; hitting number one on the pop charts with a cover of Badfinger's "Without You" (later decimated by Mariah Carey); and scoring an odd novelty cult hit with the song "Coconut," later repopularized by its inclusion on the "Reservoir Dogs" soundtrack (the aforemtioned "Jump Into the Fire" was also used to great effect in the soundtrack of "Goodfellas," during the scene when coked-up Ray Liotta's car is being chased by helicopters).   One of the critical and commercial highlights of Nilsson's career was the 1971 album "Nilsson Schmilsson," which includes all the songs mentioned in the above paragraph, in addition to some wonderful R&B covers ("Early in the Morning," "Let the Good Times Roll") and lots of examples of Nilsson's classic songwriting and beautiful voice. The fact that he caught the attention of the Fab Four is not surprising when you hear the Beatlesque flourishes in much of the melodies. I also hear a strong Randy Newman influence, particularly in the strings and heavy dependence on piano.   The CD was reissued this month with lots of liner notes and a healthy selection of bonus tracks (including an odd Spanish-language version of "Without You").   Carter Burwell,  urlLink "Fargo/Barton Fink (soundtracks)"  There are many reasons why I love the films of Joel and Ethan Coen, and one of them is the scores. Coen regular Carter Burwell has composed the music for most of their films, crafting haunting cues for their quirky noir tales. Two of the best scores are included in this collection. Burwell doesn't feel the need to include swelling, bloated orchestral sweeps every thirty seconds and I appreciate that. There's a heavy emphasis on dark, brooding strings. By the way, if you buy this and like it, I wholeheartedly recommend Burwell's soundtrack to the Coen's "The Man Who Wasn't There," which also includes excerpts from Beethoven piano sonatas.    urlLink "American Splendor"  While "Lost in Translation" was rightfully hailed by nearly every critic under the sun as the best film of 2003, this quirky gem was unfairly brushed aside, particularly in the Oscar nominations. The true story of comic book writer and oddball legend Harvey Pekar, "American Splendor" tells the tale of this grumpy-but-lovable file clerk who befriends legendary comic artist Robert Crumb, begins writing the seminal comics that Crumb would illustrate, and meets a motley crew of fellow oddballs through his life's journey. Interspersed within the film are testimonials from the real Pekar (and his wife), in addition to some enjoyable animation sequences. Pekar may not be warm and fuzzy (at least on the outside), but this is one warm and completely winning film. Paul Giamatti is absolutely brilliant as Pekar, and I was stunned that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar (but the film's screenplay got a nod, which is nice).

       afterlife   You're all probably sick of hearing about how much I loved "Volume 4," last year's Joe Jackson Band "reunion" album, in addition to how much sheer, mind-numbing fun I had at both Joe Jackson concerts I saw during the reunion tour. If you want aural proof of just how fun it was, you're in luck. Next month, Joe is releasing a live album from the tour, entitled  urlLink "Afterlife."  Buy and enjoy.

       bach versus britney   Anthony Tommasini wrote an insightful piece in yesterday's New York Times called  urlLink "No Requiem for Classical CD's, Please,"  wherein he bemoaned the current state of classical music sales in this age of music downloading and cultural apathy.   Not only is classical music another victim of the Internet, it's also facing heavy competition from more popular music forms, particularly from a financial standpoint. One point in particular stood out for me:   "In the glory decades artists like Arthur Rubinstein and George Szell made big money from their recordings. Today, with the exceptions of a handful of stars, most artists understand that recordings will not make them a living. It is hard to speak of classical and pop recordings as the same industry. A violin recital album that sold 5,000 to 10,000 copies over three to five years would be considered a solid success. Sales of 50,000 would be considered extraordinary. By contrast EMI paid $28 million just to buy out Mariah Carey's contract in 2002."   Who's to blame here? A lot of people, quite frankly. Our schools aren't properly funded for music appreciation programs, which are all but extinct. Nobody seems to care that children are virtually oblivious to classical music, yet MTV shoves Kid Rock, Justin Timberlake, 50 Cent, Janet Jackson and her nipple down their throats. Consequently, a variety of musical styles is failing to reach kids.  Today's marketing geniuses are horribly wrongheaded, in my opinion, when it comes to selling the concept of classical music. It seems to me they feel that it should appeal to the lowest common denominator. Instead of showcasing slightly more obscure, challenging works by both modern composers and the centuries-old ones, labels like Decca and RCA are putting out moronic, pandering, condescending collections like "Classical Music for People Who Hate Classical Music" and "Midnight Adagios," poor, simpering excuses for a sublime art form that deserves far better. These compilations invariably include the same pile of overplayed classics: Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik," Beethoven's "Fifth Symphony," Pachelbel's "Canon," Wagner's "Flight of the Valkyries," and of course, that old warhorse of the Victoria's Secret changing room, Vivaldi's "Four Seasons." How can you expect people to embrace this music if you're only showing them a small, overexposed portion of it? Classical music goes back (at least) to the 12th century. How can you expect the average music listener to look beyond the relatively mediocre talents of Andrea Bocelli when nobody else seems to have his advertising budget?   (It should be stated, however, that there are several labels still doing it right. ECM, Nonesuch, and the venerable Deutsche Grammaphon - among others - continue to put out quality product. You generally can't go wrong with 99 percent of the discs released by these labels. And while there are many classical budget labels out there whose quality is questionable, the Naxos budget brand is almost always of the best possible quality, ideal for classical fans looking to save some money).   Back to music appreciation...I spent grades one through four in an English-speaking school outside of Paris (named, strangely enough,  urlLink the American School of Paris ). Some of the best times I had in that school were in music class. Our teacher was a young music freak named Chris Chater (he now runs the school's website). Mr. Chater didn't just ramble on in a monotone voice in front of a chalkboard about the virtues of  Debussy. He got us excited about the music, in a hands-on way. On any given day, he would bring out a particular instrument and let us all take turns trying it out. We sang songs, read music, and even participated in a musical that Mr. Chater wrote himself. I consider Chris Chater one of the dozen most important people in my childhood because he helped me appreciate music, a trait I carry with me to this very day.   Variety is indeed the spice of life. Don't let a thousand years of musical variety pass you by.

       oh, the places i go!(part II)       urlLink create your own visited country map   Once again, I cheated a bit here. I've been in Greek airports twice (one time lasted a couple of hours), and although I never did much sightseeing there, I've spent a total of two nights in Japan. I spent a total of about two hours in Thule Air Base, Greenland, but look at what a big chunk it takes up on the map. Impressive!  I've noticed, however, that there are two places not listed in the country preferences. Bahrain (in the Persian Gulf) is actually some sort of territory or principality, which is the only explanation I can think of for its absence. Nevertheless, I was there. It was about an hour on a bus in the middle of a runway, but I was there all right. I also spent two years on the island of Diego Garcia, located smack dab in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Trust me, it's there.

       memo to the politically correct   I haven't received any hate mail about this yet, but just in case...let me say for the record that in my Oscar prediction post from yesterday, I referred to Djimon Hounsou (originally from Benin, West Africa) and Shoreh Aghdashloo (originally from Iran) as "dark horses" in this year's Oscar race. No racism was intended. It's a mere coincidence.   Don't you people have a Janet Jackson Nipple Scandal to talk about?

       that football thing   I'm not a sports fan in any way, shape or form. Last night Liza and I watched the three remaining episodes of the "Homicide: Life on the Street, Season Three" box set I bought last month in Phoenix, and flipped over to the game every once in a while just to see if Kenmore Square and Faneuil Hall would be looted and rioted out of a) glee; or b) anger. Fortunately (I guess) it was the former.   Oh, and we did in fact watch the halftime show in its entirety at Liza's request. Forget the fact that I'm not really a fan of any of last night's performers; to quote Liza, "they couldn't come up with new songs to perform?" Or, as  urlLink April  put it, "Rhythm Nation? Welcome back to my middle school years!" And speaking of Janet Jackson...staged or accidental, it was just a boob, folks.

       my oscar predictions   As a self-confessed, unabashed Oscar freak (who hates all other awards shows, I must point out), I feel it's my duty to give you my predictions for this year's ceremony. I was originally going to wait until later in the month to form my opinions, but I doubt my mind is going to change about any of these. It seems to me there's a lot of "sure things" this year, although I'm sure there will be at least one major upset (there always is -- last year it was Adrien Brody winning best actor over heavily favored Daniel Day-Lewis, and the year before that, Jim Broadbent took home best supporting actor when everyone thought that Ian McKellan would win, etc etc), but this is as good as it's going to get in my mind.   Two things: first of all, I'm going to tell you who I think  should  win (keeping in mind my own personal tastes), in addition to who  will  win (keeping in mind the history of Oscar voting). Second, I'm going to only give predictions for the top six categories.  All due respect to the technical folks, I could care less who wins best sound or best costume design.   Best Picture: Lord of the Rings: Return of the King Lost in Translation Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World Mystic River Seabiscuit  "Lord of the Rings" was a gargantuan epic that won over critics and audiences alike. The best picture Oscar usually goes to an epic film and this is as epic as it gets. "Master and Commander" has an epic quality and received rave reviews, but "Lord of the Rings" simply overshadowed it. "Lost in Translation" was my favorite film of 2003, and the Academy has shown uncharacteristic taste this year in nominating lots of smaller, quirker films, but let's not kid ourselves. This ain't Sundance. "Mystic River" is probably the closest thing to serious competition that "Lord" has in this category, and I won't be too surprised if it in fact wins, but "Lord" is a steamroller that will not be stopped. Oh, and as far as "Seabiscuit" goes, the fact that this is the film's only major nomination is a bad sign.   Who will win: "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" Who should win: "Lost in Translation"  Best Actor: Johnny Depp, "Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl" Ben Kingsley, "The House of Sand and Fog" Jude Law, "Cold Mountain" Bill Murray, "Lost in Translation" Sean Penn, "Mystic River"  It's nice to see Depp -- a terrific actor -- get a nomination, and seeing the Academy nominate such an offbeat, comedic part is a nice surprise. But let's face it: the Oscars are about dramas. Kingsley is a highly accomplished actor and a favorite with the Academy, but this film didn't get hugely positive reviews (he really deserved a best supporting actor award for "Sexy Beast" two years ago, which he didn't get). Law is getting lots of praise for "Cold Mountain," but it's not his time yet. It's really between Murray and Penn, who both won Golden Globes this year. As great as Murray was in "Lost in Translation," it was Penn  who got slightly better reviews, he's been up for an Oscar a few times before, and "Mystic River" is a very dramatic, Oscar-friendly film. So the scales are tipped slightly in his favor.   Who will win: Sean Penn Whould should win: Bill Murray  Best Actress: Keisha Castle-Hughes, "Whale Rider" Diane Keaton, "Something's Gotta Give" Samantha Morton, "In America" Charlize Theron, "Monster" Naomi Watts, "21 Grams"  She's one of the two dark horses in this category, but don't count out Castle-Hughes: the Academy loves to honor underage nominees (Tatum O'Neal, Anna Paquin). Still, she's in pretty heavy competition. Keaton wouldn't be a total shock, since the Academy loves her and everyone is cheering on the fact that a fiftysomething is being nominated in a romantic role. Morton is another dark horse, but may get swept up in the surprising wave of "In America" nominations. Watts is a highly regarded actor, but the fact of the matter is that everyone's predicting Theron will win and so do I. Seeing this gorgeous woman transformed into a battered, broken-down serial killer says a lot about Theron's talent and dedication to the role, and besides, actors who radically transform their appearance for a film have the edge. Ask Nicole Kidman and her schnozz in "The Hours."  Who will win: Charlize Theron Who should win: Charlize Theron   Best Supporting Actor: Alec Baldwin, "The Cooler" Benicio del Toro, "21 Grams" Djimon Hounsou, "In America" Tim Robbins, "Mystic River" Ken Watanabe, "The Last Samurai"  I'd love to see Baldwin win; he was great in "The Cooler" and is just such a great actor, period. He may very well pull an upset. Del Toro's a great actor but he won an Oscar three years ago (for "Traffic") and if he does get another Oscar, it'll be further down the road. Hounsou is the dark horse here. Nobody saw this nomination coming and he most likely won't get the award. Watanabe has received great reviews, particularly for out-acting Tom Cruise, but "Mystic River" has gotten much more praise, particularly for the acting of Penn and Robbins.   Who will win: Tim Robbins Who should win: Alec Baldwin  Best Supporting Actress: Shohreh Aghdashloo, "The House of Sand and Fog" Patricia Clarkson, "Pieces of April" Marcia Gay Harden, "Mystic River"  Holly Hunter, "thirteen" Renee Zellweger, "Cold Mountain"  Aghdashloo is the dark horse here, and regardless of her performance, nobody's heard of her and that will definitely play against her. Clarkson is a critically acclaimed actress, but "Pieces of April" may be too quirky for the Academy, and most people felt that Clarkson should have been nominated for "The Station Agent" instead. Marcia Gay Harden. I just don't get her. I just don't think she's an Oscar-caliber actress. She won an Oscar for "Pollock" two years ago that I felt was totally undeserved (Ed Harris should have won the best actor Oscar that year for the same film, if you ask me). She was decent in "Mystic River," but was overshadowed by the other actors. I haven't seen "thirteen" yet, but a lot of people are disappointed that Hunter's co-star, Evan Rachel Wood, wasn't nominated. Hunter was probably nominated simply because she's Holly Hunter (also known as the Jack Nicholson/Meryl Streep Syndrome). That leaves Renee Zellweger. She's been nominated before (some people think she's been robbed in the past) and I think it's her year.  Who will win: Renee Zellweger Who should win: Renee Zellweger  Best Director: Fernando Meirelles, "City of God" Peter Jackson, "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" Sofia Coppola, "Lost in Translation" Peter Weir, "Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World" Clint Eastwood, "Mystic River"  Jackson is as close to a sure thing as you'll get here. He was snubbed for the two previous LOTR installments and I think everyone realizes what kind of superhuman ability it takes to put together a film of this caliber. "City of God" got excellent reviews but nobody saw it. Coppola -- the first American woman ever nominated in this category -- would have a chance if Jackson weren't in the running. Weir has been nominated a few times before and has never won, which would give him a nice career acheivement/sympathy vote (like Scorcese almost got least year), and everyone loves Eastwood. But all that is moot. Jackson will win. Bank on it.

       the cooler: my oscar marathon begins   After the  urlLink Oscar nominations  were announced last Tuesday, Liza and I made a decision to see as many of the nominated films as possible until the ceremony on Feb. 29. We figured that if we see two or three every weekend, that would go a long way.   Well, financial strains prevented us from seeing more than one this weekend (my rent was due).  The film we ended up seeing was  urlLink "The Cooler,"  which I enjoyed a lot despite some sappy moments. I knew the basic premise of the film before going in, but there were a few surprises, especially the two or three moments of unexpected (and fairly graphic) violence. I also saw a lot more of William Macy's body than I ever care to see again.   The main reason I was in such a rush to catch this film was it's Oscar nomination, in this case Alec Baldwin's Best Supporting Actor nod. Was Baldwin deserving of a nomination? I certainly think so. He captured his character's mafioso tough guy attitude perfectly. But it's sad to see Macy -- and, to a lesser extent, Maria Bello -- get passed up for nominations. They were both very good as well.

       the workers are going home...   One of the coolest reissue programs in CD history is outdoing itself once again. Universal's two-disc Deluxe Edition Series has recently released a, you guessed it, two-disc deluxe edition reissue of the  urlLink  first Weezer album.  Is this too cool for words or what?  The "bonus disc" features some b-sides, live material and such that may be old news for die-hard fans, but I don't necessarily consider myself a die-hard "I must touch Rivers Cuomo's beard in order to live a complete life" kind of person. I think that Weezer are easily one of the best bands to come out of the nineties, and Cuomo is a power-pop songwriter of the highest order, but so far, I've only bought the standard releases, choosing to forgo CD singles, rare bootlegs, et al. So this reissue, once I get my hands on it (sooner rather than later), will be a welcome edition to my collection.   I remember when the first Weezer album came out in 1994. I remember seeing videos for "Buddy Holly," "Undone (the Sweater Song)" and "Say It Ain't So" constantly (and laughing my ass off at the sheer brilliance of the "Buddy Holly" video). For some obscure reason, I put off buying this stellar collection of Ric Ocasek-produced tunes until the Spring of 1997. My wife and I split up in January of that year, and I spent the next year or two discovering bands I'd previously given the shaft during my marriage. Weezer was one of those bands. Listening to that album still brings back memories of my too-cool-for-words apartment in Naples that I shared with my friend Jeremy. Soon afterwards I bought Weezer's second album, "Pinkerton," which was initially doomed a sophmore slump until it reached fan-approved classic status to the point where most fans consider it their best. I remember driving through the hellacious Naples traffic in my beat-up 1982 Alfa Romeo Giulietta with "El Scorcho," "Getchoo," "The Good Life" and the rest of those darkly catchy songs embedding themselves into my musical consciousness.  Subsequent Weezer albums have fared almost, if not equally as well with me. The long-awaited "Green Album" was simple and to the point -- without the darkness of "Pinkerton," but no less successful in my book. "Maladroit" was a return to some of the experimentalism of "Pinkerton," and it also contains "Dope Nose," which fits easily into my list of the Top Ten Catchiest Songs in Music History (if such a list existed).

       the death of a legend   A truly sad day in the history of cinema. Sir Peter Ustinov  urlLink has left us. .  In a world of hyperbole, exaggeration and undeserved kudos, Ustinov was the real deal. An actor's actor. In addition to his thespian accomplishments, he was also a gifted humanitarian (particularly for his tireless efforts on behalf of UNICEF). His acting, however, was what really gave him the well-deserved recognition. In addition to his two Oscars (for "Topkapi" and the incomperable "Spartacus"), he also received a screenplay nomination (for "Hot Millions") as well as an additional acting nomination (for "Quo Vadis").    It may not have gotten him official accolades in the form of Oscars, but his portrayal of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth, Hercule Poirot, in "Death on the Nile" and "Evil Under the Sun" were the perfect cinematic interpretation of both obsessive-compulsive behavior and high camp.   Let's hope his headstone is marked with what he really wanted: "keep off the grass."

       a ghost's due date   In anticipation of their upcoming, long-overdue album, "A Ghost is Born," Wilco has redesigned their  urlLink website.  Nice design. I like it. In addition to the track list (which has been up there for some time), the songs' running times are also posted. There's a song on there that runs a little over fifteen minutes. Holy crap! Have Wilco gone prog? That would be something.    the adventures of audrey in boston   My daughter Audrey arrived safely in Boston yesterday afternoon. Today we made a trek out to the  urlLink Museum of Fine Arts,  which she enjoyed muchly. Score one for Dad. Tomorrow we're going to check out the new Nascar I-Max movie at the Aquarium. Right now she's watching TV. I have no idea what exactly she's watching, but judging from the maniacal laughter I'm hearing, it must be something funny. We're kind of playing the whole week by ear, but a trip to the movie theater is in order, followed by a possible trek to New Hampshire to visit my sister Karen and her two kids (Audrey's cousins). No hilarious father-daughter anecdotes to recall at this time, but the week is just beginning. Stay tuned.    burning in brighton   Saturday night, Liza and I had a wonderful evening hanging out with the always engaging Jessica Suarez, a.k.a. Sanchez (who really needs to start her own blog, I keep telling her). After a scrumptious meal at Anna's Taqueria, we headed to the Starbucks in Washington Square ("the greatest Starbucks ever," Suarez opines) and then trekked out to Suarez' lovely Brighton apartment, where a CD burning party was whipped into shape. Armed with two laptops, I put together an excellent Frank Zappa primer ("Frankie Goes To Brighton," I called it), in addition to a great Elvis Costello compilation ("Elvis Sanchez: White Knuckle Sandwich" -- inside jokes were flying that night), both for Suarez, while she made me a lovely Matthew Sweet mix ("Mateo Dulce," she called it -- she's always giving props to her peeps). She also dubbed an Elton John compilation for Liza. We left in time to catch the very last red line train at Park Street. I hate catching the last train. It's better than shelling out money for a cab, but the train ended up sitting on the platform for about 30 minutes. A rather blah ending to an excellent evening.    aerosmith's indie moment   Right now as I type this, I have all the songs that I've imported onto Liza's iBook (for various compilations I've made over the past few weeks) playing in random. Total random. This makes for some rather awkward, yet positively eclectic transitions (Bach into Aerosmith has been my favorite so far), but it also provokes some interesting theories. For example, last week I made an Aerosmith mix, a bunch of their obscure seventies tracks ("Dream On" and "Walk This Way" were passed over in favor of "Somebody" and "Nobody's Fault," for instance). One of their most interesting and daring songs from that era was a Joe Perry composition called "Bright Light Fright," from their drug-addled 1977 album, "Draw the Line" ("days full of night" was how Steven Tyler described the making of that album on "Behind the Music"). Joe himself sings the song, and it's about two minutes long, lightning fast with a manic sax solo right in the middle. In the midst of bloated corporate rock, Aerosmith made a punk rock song. There's no other way to describe it. Boy, I love that song. And its punkness was validated once again as I heard it this afternoon, merged right into "Perfect Lines" by the Promise Ring. Wonderful transition. Unbeatable.

       but i still love you all   As I mentioned earlier, I will be on vacation all of next week. I won't be checking my e-mail too often, and it's doubtful that much, if any, blogging will take place. But that doesn't mean you can't continue to check out the blog! After all, look at all those tasty archives on the left! Filled with creamy, nostalgic archival goodness. Mmmm....

       listen to the book   Various posts and comments (on this and other blogs) by  urlLink Dan,   urlLink Heather  and myself have prompted me to pose a unique question to the general population, particularly those of you who read a lot of books: if you listen to an  unabridged  audio book, can you tell someone in all honesty that you've "read the book?"  Personally, I think you can. You've digested every word that's been printed (again, we're talking  unabridged ), it just so happens that you listened to it (word for word) instead of read it.   I, for one, went through a lengthy audiobook obsession in the mid-late nineties. From 1994 to 1995, I lived in Virginia Beach, and commuted by myself by car to my job at a TV station in downtown Norfolk -- about a 45-minute drive each way. I checked out unabridged audiobooks from the local library on a regular basis and it made my commute a hundred times more pleasant, particularly when sitting in traffic.   Later, when living and working in Italy (1996-1999), I resumed this habit -- although a good chunk of that time was spent owning a beat-up, primer-red 1982 Alfa Romeo sedan with a beat-up boombox in the passenger seat serving as a tape deck. But it did the trick.   One time I got a little obsessive -- I had an audiobook of "The Hunt For Red October" in my car and the printed book at home. I went back and forth between listening to the tapes in the car and reading the book at home. This may be one of the reasons my marriage didn't work out.   Once again, I implore anyone looking into passing their commuting time by reading audio books to get unabridged versions -- they're a bit harder to find and more expensive, but definitely worth it. Also, since the price of these items tends to be a little on the expensive side (depending on the size of the book and the amount of CDs or tapes required), I would look into checking them out from your local library.

       law and disorder   Say it ain't so! Jerry Orbach may be  urlLink leaving  "Law & Order," where he's played wisecracking Detective Lennie Briscoe since he joined the cast in 1992.   In a way, I'm not too surprised or even terribly disappointed in this news. Don't get me wrong, I love the Briscoe character, and Orbach's a great actor (he's also an excellent film actor. I've never seen "Dirty Dancing," so I can't comment on his performance in  that  masterpiece, but he was brilliantly sleazy as Martin Landau's mob-connected brother in Woody Allen's excellent  urlLink "Crimes and Misdemeanors."  But I digress).  The fact is, he's getting a little long in the tooth to be playing a detective, chasing perps around the streets of Manhattan. There's an occasional running gag on "Law & Order" where, whenever Briscoe and Green are chasing a fleeing suspect, Briscoe has to stop and catch his breath every once in a while. This is most likely played as a humorous aside, but the fact is, Orbach's pushing 70. Let's be realistic here.   I'll always treasure his battle-scarred, been-there-done-that, twice-divorced wisenheimer character on my favorite TV show of all time, but he'll live on forever in syndication, and besides -- some fresh blood might be good for the show (the writing has faltered a bit over the past couple of seasons, and the SVU spin-off, in my opinion, has been excelling the original series in terms of general quality lately).   I love ya, Lennie!

       and the horse you rode in on!   That's the catch phrase that Liza and Suarez (and, by association, me) have attempted in vain to revive. Let's make it happen, shall we?  Between various projects that are being accomplished with varying degrees of success, work-study students and temps calling in sick like there's no tomorrow and trying to get a variety of things accomplished before my vacation next week, it's a wonder that any blogging is taking place here at all. Don't get me wrong, I've been  reading  plenty of blogs this week -- but I sure as hell haven't been posting much.   I mentioned vacation -- this is true. Next week, my daughter Audrey is going to be staying with me for a week, visiting from Illinois. Sorry to spring this on those of you unaware of the fact that I am a father, but that's a fact. I was married from 1992 to 1997 and one of the only upsides to that relationship was Audrey, who just turned 11 last December. You wouldn't guess it by looking at her, though: taking after her mother, Audrey is unusually tall for her age and could probably pass for 14. No major plans are in store for the week, perhaps a trip to the movies, a  urlLink Duck Tour  (which we've both done before, but they're so much fun), an excursion up to New Hampshire to see my sister and her kids...no plan is the best plan, I think. I'm also thinking of taking Audrey to the  urlLink Museum of Fine Arts,  and hopefully she won't be bored stiff.   So what else is new? I'm currently reading Michael Connelly's "Lost Light," (see link in previous post), and I think the reason I ditched it last year was because I just wasn't in the mood. It's the only Connelly book I have yet to read -- until  urlLink his next one  comes out in May. Speaking of books,  urlLink Dan  depressed the hell out of me by posting a list of the books he's read so far this year -- 26 of them! How the hell he finds the time I have no idea. I'll be lucky if I get 26 read by the end of the year. So far here's my lame list for 2004:   urlLink 1. Noise Abatement - Carole Anne Davis   urlLink 2. The Conspiracy Club - Jonathan Kellerman   urlLink 3. Deception Point - Dan Brown   urlLink 4. Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs - Chuck Klosterman   urlLink 5. Paranoia - Joseph Finder   urlLink 6. Lost Light - Michael Connelly   Looks pretty lame next to Dan's list, but he's the one with the big brain.   What else have I been up to? Spending an inordinate amount of time obsessing over my classical CDs. Pinching pennies in anticipation of Audrey's visit (the one major exception being my purchase of the urlLink "Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Season One"  DVD last weekend). Continuing to fight off the final remains of a particularly ass-kicking cold. Continuing to learn all I can about   urlLink Adobe Premiere Pro  without the benefit of formal training. Wondering when the hell spring is going to finally be here.   And that's about it. You're all caught up.

       art crime   My friend  urlLink Terry  sent me this link a while ago, which prompted me to laugh my ass off for a few minutes, then, for some unknown reason, promptly forget about it. If you're endlessly entertained by the juxtaposition of "Law & Order" and abstract art (and who isn't?), then check out  urlLink "Law & Order: Artistic Intent."    My favorite pieces are  urlLink "Standard Procedure,"   urlLink "Justice Commemorated,"  and, for some strange reason, the oddly alluring  urlLink "A Night Away"  (check out McCoy's nostalgiac facial expression). This is some weird shit. I love it.

       the sickness update   So here's the deal: I called in sick on Wednesday, then felt marginally better on Thursday morning, so I returned to work. What a mistake that was. I spent the rest of Thursday back to my old crappy self again, scarfing down Dayquil like it was Halloween candy and cursing my own overabundant snot. To make matters worse, work was extremely busy and I ignored my better instincts by actually heading to my part-time job at Borders instead of calling it a night at 4 p.m. A workaholic's work is never done.   So I basically forced myself to call in sick again today. Which hasn't been so bad. Apart from the coughing and aforementioned omnipresent boogers, it's been a nice, relaxing day -- perfect for recuperation. Liza, angel that she is, brought over her iBook, so I spent the day burning CDs. I created three nifty compilations that I must say, I'm pretty proud of. The problem is, I have little to no food left in the house, so I imagine I'll have to brave the outdoors sometime soon and do some shopping.   Sad news via CNN.com this morning: J.J. Jackson died of a heart attack. Those of you glued to MTV in its infancy -- as I was -- will recognize the name. J.J. was one of MTV's five initial veejays when the station first launched in 1981. Sure, all those guys -- including Mark Goodman, Alan Hunter, Nina Blackwood and Martha Quinn (my junior high school crush of the highest order) -- were supreme geeks, but they were around when MTV was doing what it was supposed to do: show music videos. And the cool thing about showing videos in those days was that few people were producing them, so a lot of bands who wouldn't get the time of day in 2004 were in heavy roation in the early 80s. It wasn't uncommon to turn on MTV in 1981 and see Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, Squeeze, Madness, Joe Jackson...hell, they even broadcast a Frank Zappa concert! They were probably "cutting edge" because there were few mainstream artists embracing this art form -- but at least it made for somewhat interesting television. Oh well. That was then, this is now.

       sick   I called in sick yesterday. I don't do that very often, I'm sort of paranoid that one day, I'll be laid up with a debilitating sickness that will require weeks of sick-time, so I'm really frugal about it. I've been at my current job for about three and a half years, and I believe that yesterday was the fourth or fifth time I've called in sick. I'm so boring.   Anyhoo, I woke up Tuesday morning with a sore throat that made me feel like someone ripped out my tonsils. Things eventually got a little better, but I was still sick. I was warning people at work that I probably wouldn't be in the next day, which, come to think of it, doesn't look good. It sounds as if I'm planning some big all-day drinking binge and didn't want anyone to expect me at work. But let's assume nobody really did think that.   So I stayed home all day yesterday, slept a whole lot, watched little to no TV, instead preferring to read the last two-thirds of  urlLink "Paranoia,"  which I rather enjoyed. Last night, I watched four episodes of  urlLink Law & Order  (two on TNT, two on NBC). So much for "little to no TV," I guess.  This morning I started reading  urlLink "Lost Light,"  the latest Michael Connelly book that was just released in paperback earlier this month. Connelly is probably my favorite mystery writer, and I've read all his previous ones, but when I first started reading this one last year (when it was first released), I couldn't get into it, probably because I was suffering from Connelly burnout. But I'm giving it another chance, especially since he has a new one coming out in May ( urlLink "The Narrows" ), and I'd like to be all caught up before starting that one.

       the end of an era   They were granted a "stay of execution" last year, but this time it's really going to happen:  urlLink Avenue Victor Hugo Books  is closing its doors for good in May.   This wonderful used bookstore was originally planning to close last year, but found a new location (a few doors down from its original spot on Newbury Street). However, the loss of former customers who thought the store had closed at the end of 2002, compounded with an overall loss of business to chain stores, not to mention the changing shopping patterns on Newbury Street, made the store's continuing the struggle impossible.  I realize it seems hypocritical for me, a part-time employee at a large bookstore chain, to mourn the loss of this fine establishment, but Avenue Victor Hugo Books is a wonderful place that recalls a former time when people did the unthinkable: browsed in bookstores. For hours. I remember one particular visit to AVH in January 2002: on a snowy Saturday afternoon, I wandered into the store and spent about an hour looking around their paperback mystery section, finding a book to purchase, spending the entire afternoon reading the book and even sitting in Pinocchio's in Harvard Square with it, scarfing down a slice of pizza before catching a Jimmy Smith concert at the House of Blues (okay, that was quite a tangent, but it proves a point: this place has some genuinely nice memories for me).   Then there was the time after work last year that I headed over to the store to see, just out of curiosity, if they might have a copy of "666," an out-of-print horror book by Jay Anson (the author of "The Amityville Horror"), a book that I read (and was thoroughly scared to death by) at age 13. They had it. I bought it (and took it home, only finding it mildly scary and largely lame).   At Borders, you can look up a book on a computer (okay, the software isn't perfect -- I realize that), you can listen to a CD on the listening stations, buy a cup of coffee, power up your laptop with our wireless Internet signal...but in a place like Avenue Victor Hugo, it's like a book freak's equivalent of mainlining their favorite drug: the pure pleasure of wandering through the stacks and soaking it all in.   Starting April 1, AVH will be holding a 50% off sale, with further reductions to follow if necessary. Give them their last gasp of business. It's the least you can do.  And if you still need your used bookstore jones fulfilled, there's always the slightly fancier-but-still authentic  urlLink McIntyre and Moore  in Davis Square in Somerville.

       congratulations, you're a moron   Today's Boston Globe features an  urlLink article  on rapper 50 Cent, which pulls excerpts from a recent Playboy interview. Right off the bat, we're assured of 50's homophobia:   "I ain't into [expletive]," using a familiar antigay epithet. "I don't like gay people around me, because I'm not comfortable with what their thoughts are."  He goes on to say: "It's OK to write that I'm prejudiced. This is as honest as I could possibly be with you." In the same interview, 50 acknowledges his mother was bisexual and asserts, "But women who like women, that's cool."   Have I mentioned that we still have a lot of work to do?

       nice work if you can get it   Working in the media relations department of a medical institute, our office receives a subscription to, among other things, the Journal of the American Medical Association (or JAMA).  I don't normally read this publication, but as I was waiting to meet with a co-worker this afternoon, I began thumbing idly through the latest issue in our front desk reception area. The headline "Stool-Sniffing Science" caught my eye. Wouldn't it do the same for you? Anyway, here's the first paragraph of this scintillating report (not recommended for lunchtime reading):   "Infectious diarrhea has many causes, and in the days it takes for current diagnostic techniques to diagnose the microbe responsible, the infection can spread quickly and kill. Now scientists from the British Royal Infirmary and the University of the West of England, both in Bristol, England, have proposed a novel solution to the problem: a technique that uses gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy to identify the culprit by analyzing the odor of the patient's stool."   I'm wondering how these lucky scientists bring up the subject of their jobs during dates.

       dog bites   Taking a cue from  urlLink Ben,  I've decided to shamelessly promote  urlLink Mike Keneally's  upcoming album, "Dog," to be released sometime in the spring. It's a heady time for Kenealliacs like Ben and myself. This will be Keneally's first album since 2001's gorgeous "Wooden Smoke." As always, Mike has provided a  urlLink medley  of audio snippets from this soon-to-be-released album.  If you like what you hear, go to Mike's  urlLink site  to find out how to pre-order "Dog." Then do it. Then buy everything else he's done. Really!

       burn, baby, burn   My adventures with Liza's new  urlLink iBook  continued over the weekend as I burned a CD on it for the first time. On Saturday night, I imported CDs featuring all the songs I wanted for a particular mix I was working on, and Sunday, while sitting in the  urlLink Cambridgeside Galleria  Starbucks waiting for Liza (so we could pick up a cable for her printer), I picked the songs and burned a disc. It's a really good Elvis Costello compilation. I'm really happy that I was able to not only put together a mix totally wireless in a coffee shop, but that it's a relatively painless procedure, considering the fact that my previous computer, which became very old and slow in its last days, was a bear to mix CDs with.   I also finished  Chuck Klosterman's urlLink "Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs"  yesterday. I enjoyed it, although I found Chuck's previous book,  urlLink "Fargo Rock City,"  much more entertaining, mainly because it focused on one subject. "Sex..." is all over the map, which makes for some brilliant moments, but is marred by big chunks of obtuse pontificating that goes nowhere. Kind of like this blog. Anyway, I enjoyed the book, but I think Klosterman needs to be reined in on occasion.   Last night I shifted gears and started a thriller, Joseph Finder's  urlLink "Paranoia."  So far I like it. I've read Finder's four previous novels (Starting in 1992): "The Moscow Club," "Extraordinary Powers," "The Zero Hour" and "High Crimes." He specializes in espionage thrillers, although this latest one seems to be more of a "white-collar crime" thriller. The only one I outright disliked was the formulaic "High Crimes," which appears to be Finder's biggest seller, most likely because it was made into a film starring Ashley Judd (never a good sign).

       a first time for everything   I'm currently blogging on Liza's new iBook. It's my first time using it for blogging. It's my first time blogging "wireless" (Yay AirPort Extreme Card!). It's my first time blogging in Liza's North End apartment. Liza and I are watching "What Not To Wear." If the weather's a little warmer over the weekend, I'll head up to Liza's roofdeck and do my first "outdoor blog."  "Queer Eye" is beginning to take over my life: I spent a small fortune on skin products at the Body Shop today (thanks,   urlLink Kyan! ).  Thanks for reading. Don't forget to comment! Holla!

       chuck klosterman is my hero   Last night I started reading  urlLink "Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs"  by Chuck Klosterman. If you love music and pop culture dissected with laugh-out-loud humor and silly-yet-addictive tangents, for cryin' out loud, get this book. The man is hilarious. And accurate. Hilariously accurate, you could say. Or accurately hil-- oh, just get the book already.   Late last year, I read Klosterman's previous book,  urlLink "Fargo Rock City," -- his love letter to heavy metal -- and loved it to pieces. I recommend them both. Buy them as a gift-pack for your music-obsessed younger brother. Buy them for yourself.

       the people's republic of cambridge   The reason I didn't post anything about my birthday weekend festivities wasn't because it didn't go well or there was nothing to write about -- I just didn't get around to it. The fact is, I had a fantabulous time. As I mentioned last week, Liza suggested we "get away" for the weekend, but limited funds meant that we spend the weekend in Cambridge. Which is fine by me. Cambridge is a great town. Harvard Square, Central Square, Porter Square, Davis Square -- there's a lot of great squares in that snooty city across the river.   We stayed at the  urlLink Royal Sonesta  with a wonderful view of the Charles River and the Boston skyline. On Saturday afternoon, while hanging out at the Au Bon Pain in Harvard Square (where a scene between Minnie Driver and Matt Damon was shot for  urlLink "Good Will Hunting" ), we ran into my cousin Maria and her husband Kenny, which was very strange since they live out in the sticks and are hardly ever in Boston. They ended up staying in the city for the weekend, celebrating Maria's birthday, which was Sunday. We also saw  urlLink "Mystic River,"  which I saw when it first came out, but Liza hadn't because she was in Europe at the time. We also visited the wonderfully funky Black Ink on Brattle Street, where I bought a sumptous   urlLink Tintin  appointment book. Oh, and Liza and I bought a new computer on Friday.  A computer? Why, yes. Liza has been meaning to get one for the longest time. She was using my old one for a couple of years, but it finally died last year. Our friends Briana and Erin both have  urlLink iBooks,  and we both liked them a lot, so Friday night we walked over to   urlLink Cambridgeside Galleria  (right across the street from our hotel, literally) and bought an iBook. With a printer. And a wireless internet card. We are both slowly coming around to the fact that Bill Gates is Satan and Mac is the way to go. God, I love this computer. Let the CD burning begin!  Now that I've got this Mac, I'm seriously thinking about getting an  urlLink iPod.  Let me say right off the bat that I don't download music off the internet. Not necessarily because it's illegal or immoral. I just like browsing around for CDs. I like packaging. I like poring over liner notes. That's me and I can't see  not  doing those things as part of my obsessive musical rituals. As long as CDs are manufactured, packaged and sold, I'll be buying them. But the convenience of having all my music in one little cellphone-size box (particularly for commuting) is extremely appealing to me. One question for you iPod experts, though: I have nearly a thousand CDs. Can I fit all that music in an iPod? That information will help me with my decision.

       a right purdy hurdy-gurdy   This week's Newsweek has a small  urlLink piece  on a relatively obscure stringed instrument called a hurdy-gurdy, which has spiked a bit in popularity since Stink, I mean  Sting  was seen playing one on the Oscars (accompanying Alison Krauss during her performance of "You Will Be My Ain True Love" from "Cold Mountain").   I should point out to everyone reading this that, being the true music snob that I am, while watching the telecast at our friend Erin's apartment, I announced to the room, "hey! that's a hurdy-gurdy!" Erin's roommate Mike thought that it looked like a device Sting was using to "control" Alison, who was actually a robot. I realize that telling this story after the fact without you actually being there may not seem funny, but at the time -- while watching the performance -- it made all of us laugh really hard.   It turns out that Sting, a.k.a. the Obscenely Rich and Famous Musician Who Hasn't Done Anything Relevant in At Least 20 Years, wasn't even really playing it -- much. According to hurdy-gurdy "expert" Cali Hackmann, "he was, to be honest, more or less using it as a prop,"  using the "drone" strings and not the "melody" strings. A Sting spokeswoman said he had "just learned to operate it."   Can you say "poseur?"

       rest in peace   Yes, Spalding Gray is  urlLink dead,  and that's a horrible thing, but let's not forget the great Paul Winfield, who  urlLink passed away  on Sunday.   Nominated for an Oscar for 1972's  urlLink "Sounder,"  Winfield -- who also hosted A&E's excellent  urlLink "City Confidential"  and appeared in countless films over the past thirty-odd years -- is best known to me as Larren Lyttle, the smartass judge in Alan Pakula's underrated courtroom thriller  urlLink "Presumed Innocent."

       the out-of-towners   Monday (the 8th) is my birthday, and Liza -- being the super-cool awesome girlfriend that she is -- has booked us two nights in a hotel out of town. Now, neither of us can currently afford to "get away" anywhere too far from Boston, so we're actually staying in...Cambridge! That's right. Just across the river from our lovely city of work and play. We'll be at an undisclosed location (just like Cheney), enjoying room service and a river view. Yay! I'm happy. No major definitive plans other than bumming around Harvard Square, enjoying room service and perhaps catching a movie. It's a great opportunity for us to have quality time together, away from roommates (I should point out that out collective roommates are actually very cool, but nothing beats some time alone with the one you love).   Also, I believe that Liza and I will be joined by my sister Julie on Sunday for brunch at  urlLink Henrietta's Table.  Yay for brunch!  Last month, when I bought the recently reissued version of Harry Nilsson's  urlLink "Nilsson Schmilsson,"  I extolled the album's virtues here on this site. Allow me to emphasize those positive feelings one more time. I listened to the disc in its entirety on my way to work this morning and it continues to make me very happy. Stunning, soothing, rocking, quirky, gentle, romantic and funky pop/rock, written and sung by a genuinely talented (and dearly departed) individual. Highly, highly recommended.

       more fun with spam   One of the many spam messages in my in-box this morning contained the subject line "she'll thank you," presumably referring to the drug they're peddling which will turn my male organ into a all-night love machine. But what do I find in the body of the message? Why, this:  zoophagus zwitterionic zootic zygophoric zoning zoogeology zoofulvin zooecium zygospore zooecial zooecium zygomaticum zymoid zymoid zorillas zoosperms zs zonated zoophilist zoochores zunis zucchinis zygotene zoogeology zymic zooplanktonic zootomies zoomorphs zoologize zoophilitic zorillos zoopharmacological zoonist zygous zoons zouaves zoologist zoothecia   You've convinced me, e-mail shysters! Sign me up!  In other spam-related news, Bill Gates is suggesting that in the future, we will probably all pay for e-mail in order to finance more sophisticated spam blocking. I love it when a guy who's worth 46 billion dollars tells me I have to pay for something.

       the elusive nature of dissonance   On November 4, 2003, I attempted to order  urlLink this  CD of the Arditti String Quartet performing some very strange and wonderful music by the very strange and wonderful Italian composer Luigi Nono. The order was delayed three, count'em,  three  times by Amazon, each time with a cryptic yet vaguely apologetic e-mail explaining that they were having problems with the order. Finally, on Monday, I said "screw it" and canceled the damn thing. When it takes longer to process a CD order than it takes to record and manufacture the recording itself, you know it's just not worth it.   Is this part of a giant anti-modern music conspiracy? If I ordered something by hacks like Andrea Bocelli or James Galway, would they have processed my order within a day and hand-delivered it to me with a bouquet of roses? Sometimes you have to wonder...

       shopping at urban outfitters is for stupid people   As far as I'm concerned, people should be able to wear whatever they want. In the spirit of free speech, no logo or statement should be out of bounds. But  urlLink this  is just plain stupid.   We already have a hard enough time getting young voters to the polls. Do we really need a moronic "fashion statement" to reinforce apathy?   This could do one of two things. Either Urban Outfitters will benefit greatly from the publicity and sales will skyrocket, or people will see the chain's enormous lack of responsibility and refuse to frequent the stores. I'm hoping for the latter.

       in time, you can turn these obsessions into careers   I have a really boring meeting that I must attend in about 20 minutes, so I'll make this brief: yes, the Elvis Costello show last Friday night was indeed spectacular. Of the four times I've seen him in concert, this was probably the best. A great selection of songs: there was stuff from "North," in addition to lots of older chesnuts from EC's catalog, and several obscure ones as well (performances of "Home Truth" and "Inch by Inch" from his much-maligned "Goodbye Cruel World" album proves once again my theory that the album suffered from horrible production values, not horrible songwriting).   The Brodsky Quartet (who accompanied Elvis on several songs, along with EC's pianist right-hand-man, Steve Nieve) sounded fantastic. In addition to adding the necessary  gravitas  to his newer material, their arrangements of older Elvis stuff like "Pills and Soap" and "Rocking Horse Road" were terrific.   A few of the nice surprises included a cover of Randy Newman's "Real Emotional Girl" and "Scarlet Tide," the Oscar-nominated song he co-wrote with T-Bone Burnett for the "Cold Mountain" soundtrack (performed on the soundtrack by Alison Krauss). Elvis played that one by himself, on ukelele. He also covered "You'll Never Walk Alone" from "Carousel" (Liza wanted to strangle the woman in the lobby after the show who told her friend it was from "Carnival" -- I'm dating a musical theater snob and I love it!).   One minor gripe: Elvis needs to retire "Pump It Up" and "Watching the Detectives." Period. I realize that they're classic tunes in his repertoire, and they're really not bad songs, in my opinion. But does he really need to drag out interminable versions of these war-horses at every single opportunity, like his own personal "Freebird?" The guy's got enough great songs. He can ditch those two.    urlLink Here's  the setlist.

       don't they realize this is a  college  town?   First of all, I don't mean to offend Springsteen fans, or even Jimmy Buffett fans (even though all that Margaritaville bullshit gets on my nerves), but it's painfully obvious that there is a specific age bracket that's in charge of deciding who gets to  urlLink perform  at Fenway Park. Is there any way we could get some younger folk to help make these decisions?   And I'm not suggesting Britney or Justin...maybe a nice middle ground. R.E.M.? Foo Fighters? Wilco? Work with me, people.

       more delicious (and shameless) promotion   Let's talk about my new blog,  urlLink delicious media, (again) for a second, shall we? In the words of sloth-like groundskeeper Calvin Murks in Paul Auster's wonderful book  urlLink "The Music of Chance,"  while observing the stone wall Jack Pozzi and Jim Nashe are ordered to build to get out of debt: "looks like this thing's finally coming up after all." (Thursday is Obscure Reference Day). I've got three reviews of my own up there, and I've recently posted a review from Byron Schaller, who runs a great blog called  urlLink In The Congo.   I like the fact that I'm able to separate reviews and day-to-day random observations into two blogs. I also feel that having two blogs makes me seem like some kind of overacheiver, even though I most certainly am not. It reminds me of when I was temping for a  urlLink law school  a few years ago and one of my fellow temps was telling me that the professor she worked for was currently working on two books at the same time. "Hmmm," I said. "Reading two books at once, I've tried that, and it's kind of confusing."   "No," she told me. "He's  writing  two books at the same time." Ouch. That's some serious brain power. I'll pass.

       what a turn-off   Last week was  urlLink TV Turn-Off Week,  an annual, sadly underpublicized event where people are encouraged to, you guessed it, turn off their television sets for seven days and seek alternate forms of entertainment.   I personally believe that I watch too much television. Not as much as most Americans,  but I still use it as a crutch, turning it on when I get home simply because it's there. I can spend fifteen minutes flipping the channels, almost "willing" something interesting to come on. Instead of turning it off and reaching for a book, I'll usually settle for watching the most tolerable piece of crap. I happen to think that my viewing tastes are a cut above most of the country's (I avoid reality shows like the plague and am even weaning myself off VH1's ubiquitous "list-themed" programs), but still -- I don't turn it off nearly enough.   Reading about this turn-off week, I said to myself, "Self? Let's do it! Turn it off!" I personally feel that it was a week well spent, but I should first say that I cheated a little. My main infraction was that I still watched DVDs. I think there's a big difference between watching "Survivor" reruns and a quality documentary handpicked from Netflix or my own disc library. If that's cheating, so be it. Hey, it's not my fault that this boycott took place the week I started Netflix! What am I supposed to do? I've got discs coming to me by mail, I'm not gonna just sit on them!  Am I searching for absolution? You bet I am.   I should also point out that the discs I watched were all in the realitvely "highbrow" category: three documentaries ("Lost in La Mancha," "Capturing the Friedmans," the Ric Burns "New York" series [that I'm halfway done with as we speak]) and one foreign film ("Persona" -- it doesn't get any snootier than Bergman). So while I did stare at an "idiot box" during the week in question, it was not for the sake of idiotic programming.   One of my responsibilities at my job is archiving television news segments where  urlLink our organization  is featured, so I was in fact locked in a closet for several hours, scanning TV newscasts. But hey -- it was my job. What was I supposed to do?  The one instance where I was at home, not in any work-related capacity, watching television, was Saturday night. Liza and I were getting ready for bed and she was watching a Saturday Night Live rerun. I caught the "Weekend Update" segment. But again, what was I supposed to do? Get all smug and sanctimonious on her, ordering her to turn off the television? "Unplug that wretched device! You are interfering with my culturally superior sociological experiment!" No, I don't think so.   So, for the most part, I participated in this event. I read more, spent my morning getting ready for work with NPR on the radio as opposed to blow-dried anchormen on TV, and maybe -- just maybe -- I'm a slightly better person for it.   But in the meantime -- there's an all-new  urlLink "Law & Order"  on tonight! Whee!

       the neck   I was home sick yesterday and had no access to a computer, hence the lack of posting around these parts. A few days ago, my chronic neck and upper back pain (which hits me once or twice a year) flared up pretty bad. Usually, a bunch of Motrin gets rid of it after a day or two, but it's been putting up quite the fight lately. Getting out of bed was taking me -- literally -- a good ten minutes of maneuvering. Going from horizontal to vertical was a process that took several steps and a hell of a lot of wincing.   Finally, on Sunday morning (after reaching for a bottle of shampoo gave me such a sharp blast of pain that I almost passed out), I headed to the emergency room at Mass General, where they told me to double my Motrin dosage (I'm now taking 12 of those a day) and prescribed a muscle relaxant known as Flexeril. The doctor recommended that I take at least one day off, which I did. Monday was spend sipping coffee, checking out the  urlLink Today Show  and continuing to plow through my  urlLink Netflix -provided episodes of Ric Burns'  urlLink "New York"  miniseries (four down, four to go). The back still hurts a bit, but it's a lot better that it was two days ago.   Things are getting a bit stagnant over at  urlLink Delicious Media,  my brand new reviews-only site. Don't let that deter you from continuing to check it out. I plan on doing at least two or three reviews a week, even though I've only got two up there for now. I want the reviews up there to be of a good, consistent quality (i.e., not slapped together like my old Amazon reviews), so I need to actually sit down and write coherent, helpful reviews that warrant a place on that site. I'll get a new review up there by tomorrow, I promise.

       "carmine said one blog...here are two!"   Big news here at pressure drop headquarters (which is basically my cubicle, where they pay me to do something completely different; unless I'm using Liza's iBook, in which case it could be her apartment in the North End, or my place in Dorchester...whatever...). The news is that I've created a new blog. Not a replacement for this blog, but a separate one. It's called Delicious Media and can be found  urlLink here.  Don't get too excited, there's really nothing there yet.  Why another blog, you ask? Well, Delicious Media is going to be devoted strictly to reviews. Mostly music (albums and concerts) and movies, but also books and maybe television as well. I've always had reviews on this site and they seem to coexist peacefully with the usual ranting and raving, weekend reports, and emergency bulletins about what I ate for lunch. But lately I've noticed that when I'm perusing the archives (which I do mainly for quality control, not because I'm a vain arse), there's a noticeable change of flow when I go from, say, morning subway vent to a review of the new Cornershop CD. I guess it's part of my obsessive-compulsive nature and a need to have things in their little organized areas that's provided the impetus for this new site.   Also, it's quite possible that some of you out there don't care for the reviews but seem to enjoy my observations about day-to-day life in the big city. Or some of you enjoy the reviews but wish I would just shut my yap about how much I love Dunkin' Donuts Coolattas. In all of those cases, you need serious help. But more than that, you can now pick and choose (to an extent) what side of my writing you want to subject yourself to: My lame attempts at erudite criticism, or my pathetic endeavors to be the next Bill Hicks.   I won't totally ban music, movies, or other assorted pop culture from pressure drop. But if something falls squarely into the category of "review," chances are you'll find it over at the DM (being on the front line of this exciting new web development, you can be among the first to use this hip new abbreviation!).  A note about the name: after spending my lunch break agonizing over a title ("Bright Grey" was a leading contender for a while), I chose Delicious Media after realizing last night while reading Jonathan Franzen's  urlLink "How To Be Alone"  that by page 65, he'd used the word "delicious" three times, and not once to describe food. I like the idea of using the word that way. I happen to think, for example, that the packaging of CDs by  urlLink Nonesuch Records  is quite delicious. And hopefully, you'll enjoy taking a big delicious bite of the new site. Don't worry, I'll get some content up there soon enough.   Oh, I almost forgot...the title of this post is a paraphrase of a quote from the very funny and sadly underrated 1990 film   urlLink "The Freshman,"  uttered by Larry London (played by Maximillian Schell). The line is actually "Carmine said one boy...here are two!" I guess out of context, it's not really funny. Liza will probably be the only person to appreciate this, so I hope she reads it.

       persona   Over the last couple of days, I watched and returned my first three  urlLink Netflix  movies. Can I say one more time how much I love Netflix? What a great idea. Good job, people. Give yourselves a raise. Actually, I bet they just did, since Netflix's monthly fee just went up a tad (which is no problem for me -- $22 a month for all the movies I can watch is still a great deal).   I'm going to try and give brief (probably somewhat lame) reviews of as many of my Netflix films as possible.  I'll start with  urlLink "Persona,"  and hopefully, in the next day or two, I'll tell you what I thought of the other two.   "Persona" was a very good film that I can't believe I just saw for the first time two days ago, considering the fact that I've been a fan of Ingmar Bergman's films for at least two years now. I was actually holding out hope that  urlLink Criterion  would put out the DVD of this film (like they have with so many other Bergman movies), but  that dream was quashed when MGM released it, along with several other MIA Bergman discs. No worries...they did a fine job.   How was the film? I liked it a lot, although you have to sort of prep yourself for Bergman movies. They're not exactly a rip-roarin' good time. I've always had tremendous respect for what Bergman does, with cinematography, acting, and extreme subject matter. In "Persona," a famous actress (played by Bergman mainstay Liv Ullmann) is struck with a rare condition where she is unable to speak, and is cared for by a young nurse at a beach cottage. Their relationship begins hesitantly, but they are soon close and one night, the nurse (with the help of a bottle of wine), relates a story of an impromptu orgy she participated in with a girlfriend and two young boys. Later, the nurse finds out (through an opened letter she planned to mail) that the actress finds her "an amusing study." Soon it's jealousy, rage, betrayal, violence...you know, standard stuff.   I still think  urlLink "The Seventh Seal"  is Bergman's best, but this one probably runs a close second.  Besides the acting (particularly Bibi Andersson's role as the nurse), the dissonant modern classical score was probably my favorite aspect of this film.

       supersize it!   I realize that it's mean-spirited, offensive, and just plain cruel to say this, but when the CEO of McDonald's  urlLink dies of a heart attack,  is that what they call "poetic justice?"   the mighty have fallen   Kevin Spacey was apparently involved in some sort of  urlLink mugging/thievery situation  in London over the weekend. It seems he arrived at a police station, looking like he'd been beaten up and explained that he'd been mugged in the park.   What really happened is that a guy (or a "bloke," since it happened in the U.K.) told Spacey he needed to make an urgent phone call and when Spacey gave him his cell, said bloke ran off with it. Spacey actually received his injuries when he tripped over his dog (who he'd been walking) in an attempt to catch the hooligan (which he didn't). Doh!  I don't object (much) to this lie he told the police, especially since he owned up to it soon afterwards. It's an embarrassing situation, not only having your phone stolen right out of your hands, but to  trip over your dog  while trying to get it back.   Here's the point of this post, folks: Spacey told the media, "I fell for a con."   Guess what, Kevin? So have we. It's called YOUR LAST NINE OR TEN MOVIES!  Seriously. Spacey was once a highly respected thespian. He appeared in brilliant small-time movies like  urlLink "Glengarry Glen Ross"  and  urlLink "Swimming With Sharks."  When he hit the big time, he graduated to wider audiences with  urlLink "The Usual Suspects"  and  urlLink "Seven,"  while continuing to maintain the highest standards. Ditto for films like  urlLink "L.A. Confidential"  and  urlLink "Hurlyburly."  He even returned to the stage, appearing in a London production of "The Iceman Cometh." The credibility factor is still firmly in place.    I should note that I've omitted  urlLink "American Beauty"  from this parade of huzzahs. While I feel Spacey did a good acting job in that film, I personally found the movie vastly overrated (as does  urlLink Dan,  by the way). It had a few moments of brilliance, but overall it was constantly going out of its way to be a BIG IMPORTANT FILM, and ended up smug and self-satisfied. "Look!" It seemed to scream out to us. "We're soooo disfunctional!" Blah.    At any rate, perusing Kevin's  urlLink entry on allmovie.com,  I couldn't help noticing the fact that he really hasn't done anything good lately. "Pay It Forward?" "The Shipping News?" "The Life of David Gale?" "K-Pax?" Kevin, we used to look forward to your films. They were stellar examples of sublime acting and unique storytelling. Nowadays, you're just coasting. Can we have the old Kevin back? Please?

       free music! movies in the mail!   Byron over at  urlLink in the congo  is discovering something that I found out myself a few months ago:  urlLink "Blackberry Belle"  by the Twilight Singers is a really good album.   In other music acquisition news, I spent a really long day at  urlLink Borders  today, taking the reins of the monthly (or bi-monthly...or semi-monthly; I can't remember) project involving changing out the music listening posts. One of the little perks of this job (unofficially) is taking home promo copies of stuff that comes out of these listening posts. So this afternoon, I made off with some nice classical stuff that nobody but me ever wants (some  urlLink Rachmaninov,  some  urlLink Boccherini,  Cecilia Bartoli's excellent  urlLink "Salieri Album,"  Angela Gheorghiu's rather unimaginatively titled yet rather beautiful  urlLink "Diva,"  and the Trio Mediaeval's creepy new  urlLink "Soir, Dit-Elle" ), in addition to some jazz ( urlLink Bill Evans,   urlLink Alan Broadbent)  and a great new one by Iron & Wine called  urlLink "Our Endless Numbered Days."  I never heard I&W before, but Suarez told me that I would probably like it, and I do. What little I've heard of the disc so far is really wonderful. Kind of like  urlLink Nick Drake  meets  urlLink Badly Drawn Boy.   My  urlLink Netflix  adventure began today as I received my first three movies:  urlLink "Lost in La Mancha,"   urlLink "Persona"  and  urlLink Capturing the Friedmans."  Liza will be out most of the day tomorrow, so I plan on hunkering down with documentaries about Terry Gilliam and child molesters, in addition to a good old-fashioned depressing Swedish movie about death. Happy Sunday!

       meanwhile...   You know how once every month or so I don't post for a few days, then I post something about how busy I've been lately? Well here I go again. Work...um,  real  work (the kind I get paid for) has been getting in the way again. I've been spending so much time locked up in our "media closet" with  urlLink Adobe Premiere Pro  that people are starting rumors about us. It's true. I'm editing a videotape of media highlights for our trustee board meeting that happens every quarter. This is the first time I've edited the whole thing by myself, so I sort of need to concentrate. Wish me luck.  Other fun facts that I've kept from you for the past week or so:  I joined  urlLink Netflix  this morning. After Suarez and  urlLink Ben  -- two people I have lots of respect for -- sang its praises, I finally decided that the thing wasn't really a scam. I adore DVDs and buy way too many of them, and the only decent video rental place in Boston, as far as I'm concerned, is  urlLink Cinemasmith  -- not exactly across the street. This is just too cool for words: twenty bucks a month, create a "wish list" of stuff to rent, they send the movies to you (three a month), you return them in the prepaid envelope when you're done. I realize that I sound like a TV commercial for this, but it really is a great deal. Unfortunately, I started my "rental queue" without consulting  urlLink my favorite movie companion in the world,  so I hope she's up for some snooty foreign films, because I've got a shitload of those waiting to be shipped my way.   Last weekend Suarez, Liza and I watched Suarez' DVD of  urlLink "School of Rock."  I can't believe I just got around to watching that film. Jack Black is hilarious when given the right material, and that was certainly the case here. Although the main theme wasn't exactly original (geeks fight overwhelming odds to succeed), it had a nice, not-so-subliminal pro-music-in-schools message and with Black at the helm, the idea of loving music with every fiber of your being, critics be damned, came through loud and clear. It was also funny as hell.   Two weeks ago we threw caution to the winds and saw two, count 'em two movies in one Sunday (without theater-hopping, I might add).  urlLink "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"  and  urlLink "The Dreamers."  "Eternal Sunshine" was a beautiful, funny, crazy, touching work of art that I'll probably buy when the DVD comes out. Jim Carrey is proving time and time again that he doesn't have to make fart jokes to win people over. This is easily the best thing he's ever done. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman continues his odd, mindbending streak with this one, with better results (in my opinion). "Being John Malkovich" was good, "Adaptation" better, but this one resonated deepest with me, probably due to the fact that it tapped into real human emotion better that the other two combined. And the soundtrack is a killer. Check out the Beck song in the closing credits. "The Dreamers" is Bernardo Bertolucci's exquisite love letter to late sixties radical Paris, with creepy Michael Pitt playing an American student who befriends a French twin brother and sister, spending the summer with them in their apartment while the parents are away. It's NC-17 and fully deserves the controversial rating, with lots of sex (the incest angle probably didn't hurt much). Sure, it's twisted and not exactly for the whole family, but I loved the cinematography, Bertolucci's loving tributes to French new-wave cinema, the psychedelic soundtrack (mixed nicely with traditional French artists like Francoise Hardy and Edith Piaf) and some pretty good acting, too (I find Pitt oddly compelling and would love to see him in more films).   I think you're all caught up.

       laura vs. jarvis   Boy, I just love it when an annoying song gets stuck in your head. This morning, I had to write down someone's name, and their last name is  Branigan.  "Hmm," I thought. "Like  urlLink 'Laura' Branigan ." And then, wouldn't you know it, "Gloria" gets stuck in my head. That insistent 80s synth riff. The dumb lyrics. The repetitious "Gloria! Gloria!" chorus. The whole package. What a wonderful way to spend a day.   I'm trying to turn the song in my head to  urlLink "Disco 2000"  by Pulp, since they are cosmically interchageable (which is the best thing you can say about the Branigan song), but so far, it ain't happening.

       will there be a 2001 centrifuge?   If anyone out there lives in the Frankfurt area, do you think you could steal me some Kubrick memorabilia? A really cool exhibit is happening there for uber-fans like me. I'm doing the old cut-n-paste since the New York Times is a pay site and I wouldn't want to deprive any of you from this news:   The first major exhibition of props, possessions and memorabilia associated with the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, whose creations include "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Dr. Strangelove" and "Paths of Glory," has opened in Frankfurt. Among the objects on display, assembled with the help of his widow, Christiane, and his longtime executive producer, Jan Harlan, Mrs. Kubrick's brother, are personal letters, including one from Katharine Hepburn gently rejecting a request to star in a film; a Dali-inspired lip-shaped red settee seen in "Lolita"; and the zero-gravity bathroom door used in "2001." Indicative of Kubrick's notorious meticulousness are his preparations for "Napoleon," down to the shooting schedule, an armoire full of books and index cards cataloging the important people surrounding Napoleon and their year-by-year movements. The film was never made because of technical problems and exorbitant production costs. Kubrick wanted to shoot indoor scenes by candelight. The exhibition continues through July 4 at the German Film Museum and the adjacent German Architecture Museum.

       the ice harvest   How's this for interesting movie news: Harold Ramis, the actor/director known for his light comedies ("Stripes," "Ghostbusters," "Analyze This"), is turning to a much darker subject for his  urlLink next film,  an adaptation of Scott Phillips' brilliant novel, "The Ice Harvest."   While I'm not necessarily Ramis' number one fan, I enjoyed "Groundhog Day" a lot, and the cast looks interesting -- John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton are starring. They've made their share of crappy films, but they're brilliant actors when given the right project.    urlLink "The Ice Harvest"  is a wonderful book that I read about two years ago, concerning a mob lawyer in a midwestern small town who has a few hours to tie up a few loose ends before skipping town on Christmas Eve, 1979, with a bunch of money he stole from his mafia bosses. Noir of the highest order, if you ask me. Highly recommended. And if you like it, try the sequel/prequel,  urlLink "The Walkaway."

       semantics   I'm noticing more and more that kids today rarely use the word "concert," replacing it with "show." So if you went to see a band last night, you would say "I was at a  show. " When did this trend start, and why was I not informed?   Personally, I'm not a big fan of this trend. Going to a "show" sounds like you're attending a Broadway musical. But if it helps, I'll play along.

       lots of things in here don't react well to bullets   Heather recently  urlLink posted  something about a ridiculous Scottish reporter who was taken to task by Sean Connery after she asked him a rather ridiculous question. It may not have been ridiculous if you live on a steady diet of "Access Hollywood" or even your average high school newspaper. Whatever. The point is, Connery delighted in making an ass of the reporter for a few moments, then moved on. Bravo. Brainless talking heads need their egos deflated once in a while.   Heather completed her post by quoting Darrell Hammond in his infamous and very funny Sean-Connery-as-Jeopardy-player mode: "Suck it long, suck it hard" (imagining the real Connery saying this to the reporter).   I'd like to think that Sir Sean should have thrown a Marko Ramius quote her way. Something like: "It reminds me of the heady days of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin, when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets. Well now they will tremble at the sound of our silence. The order is, 'engage the silent drive!'" And then he would have just socked her in the face.   There's no point to this post, I just wanted to show off my immense knowledge of Connery quotes from  urlLink "The Hunt For Red October."  People often think of Connery as James Bond, but to me he's always Ramius, the maverick Russian sub captain. "Where I'm going, you can't follow," he whispers to the Red October's political officer, immediately after breaking his neck.

       i am trying to kick this drug   Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy has  urlLink checked himself into rehab  to treat his addiction to painkillers. The medication he's become addicted to has been used to treat his migraines, which he's suffered since childhood.   This bums me out. I'm fairly certain that Tweedy, who seems like a sensible guy with his head screwed on the right way, will get through this and continue to make wonderful music, but I can't help imagining the worst. Some people get through these things, some never do. I'm doing my best to stay optimistic. And I'm counting the days until  urlLink "A Ghost Is Born"  is released.   Get well soon, Jeff.

       wednesday night in the north end   Last night was a rare night off for both Liza and myself, and we celebrated by inviting some friends over to Liza's for spaghetti. Things started off on the wrong foot when we got to her place and realized not only that the apartment needed to be cleaned up but that the currently inoperable garbage disposal was causing the sink to become backed up. So we went to work, filling up the dishwasher, emptying buckets of dirty water from the sink into the toilet (nowhere else to put it if the kitchen sink's backed up, folks), going nuts with Clorox Wipes and generally making the place look presentable.   Zoe, Briana, Erin and Eva all showed up, in addition to Liza's roommate Nicole and her friend whose name I unfortunately forgot but seemed really cool. I drank a tad too much wine, and despite the fact that I'm a bit hungover today, Liza assured me over the phone just a minute ago that I wasn't the least bit obnoxious -- just slightly louder than usual. We played a boisterous game of Cranium and Zoe burned a few of Liza's CDs on Liza's iBook. JVD was a no-show (he told us ahead of time that the probability of his being able to attend was so-so) and Suarez, dammit all to hell, didn't make it due to a lack of communication -- the phone lines in her building were out most of the day, and in an e-mail later in the evening, she accurately dubbed herself "the incommunicada." If you run into Suarez, please try to convince her to get a cellphone. She needs one.   We also firmed up Easter plans last night -- Liza, Briana and I are all going to be home and without family this Sunday, so we're going to have a major pig-out brunch affair at Liza's apartment. Happy resurrection, pass the syrup.

       george's dilemma   I can't say that I consider myself a fan of his music, but I have respect for the talents of George Michael. That's why I find it strange that, in a supposedly sexually open-minded music business, his career has seemed to be on a downward spiral ever since he publicly announced several years ago that he was gay.   It should be noted that Michael continues to enjoy success in other parts of the world. His latest album, "Patience," debuted at the top of the charts in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Sweden and England. It has yet to even be released in the United States (except as an import).   Renee Graham's   urlLink article  in today's Boston Globe ponders this strange set of circumstances. In 1987, he was a mega-star, here and everywhere else in the world, when he released the monster hit album "Faith." These days, in the U.S., George can't...well, I won't say he  can't get arrested,  but you know what I mean.   It's easy to say that Michael's arrest a few years ago for indecent exposure in a California public restroom is the cause for his stateside decline. But doesn't controversy sell? The crux of the argument comes about midway through the article, where Graham makes an interesting comparison between Michael and R. Kelly, another popular artist whose reputation was compromised after a controversial incident:   Compared to R. Kelly's ongoing legal troubles surrounding child-pornography charges, Michael's restroom mishap is akin to a parking ticket. Yet Kelly's career has only seemed to flourish in light of the charges. He's gotten standing ovations at awards shows and enjoyed two megahits, "Ignition" and "Step in the Name of Love," from his 2003 multimillion-selling album, "Chocolate Factory." Simply put, absolutely no one seems to care Kelly may have participated in a heinous act. (Kelly is innocent until proven guilty, but his brief 1994 marriage to the late singer Aaliyah, then 15, is at least a totem of troubling behavior.)   If this is about getting in trouble with the law, it's painfully unfair. Michael tried to get his rocks off with a guy he thought was a willing participant but ended up being an overzealous undercover cop (entrapment, anyone?). R. Kelly is being accused of multiple counts of underage sex. Who's getting screwed here?

       stuck in the 80s   I never realized how much Liza says "rad," but now that I think about it, she says it quite a lot. Yesterday afternoon, we were buying movie tickets at the Kendall Square cinema when the following exchange took place between Liza and the guy in the ticket booth.   Liza: Can I use my credit card at the concession stand?  Guy: Yes you can.  Liza: Rad!  Guy: Did you just say "rad?"  Liza (sheepishly): Yeah...  Guy (amazed): That is so cool! I love it!   Seriously, the guy reacted as if we'd just told him that his favorite TV show was now available on DVD and he was getting a complimentary copy. We're talking serious nostalgia glee here. If only Liza was wearing big hair and leggings, we would have totally made this guy's week.

       not fooling anybody   I'm back! Back from vacation and back to the daily grind that is my cubicle and other assorted elements that make up a paycheck. Contrary to what I originally predicted, I actually posted a few times durnig my break last week, due to the fact that Liza was kind enough to leave her iBook at my apartment. Things sure are busy here, and I've got a good deal of catch-up work here at the office, but the last 20 minutes of my workday have been decimated by  urlLink this site,  which made me laugh a  lot  and totally ruined my productive streak. Damn you, white trash America! Infinite thanks to  urlLink David Hornbuckle  for providing the link.

       the alienist   I don't remember how it started, but about a week ago, I became obsessed with reading Caleb Carr's 1994 mystery novel  urlLink "The Alienist."  When the novel was first published, I recall a flurry of critical acclaim surrounding the fictional tale of a serial killer in 1896 New York City, but I wasn't interested, simply because period fiction wasn't really my cup of tea.   Times have changed. I've recently become more and more intrigued by American History and "The Alienist" combines a hair-raising murder mystery with frightening period accuracy. One of the more interesting aspects of the novel is the fact that a genuine historical figure plays a substantial role: Theodore Roosevelt, who was New York City's police commissioner at the time. My recent interest in Roosevelt - particularly after seeing the History Channel's wonderful "TR: An American Lion" - has given me even more incentive to check out the book.   I asked my roommate Frank, who is a voracious reader, and a particularly avid fan of history and period fiction, if he'd read the book, and he told me that he did, and loved it. I asked him if he happened to own the book so that I could possibly borrow it. He answered in what may be considered by people who don't know Frank to be a peculiar response: "I think I might." You see, Frank owns piles and piles of books. To the point where he loses track of what titles he actually owns. He invited me to plow through the collection. I checked out the hardcover selections, easily available for browsing in the bookcases of his bedroom. No luck. So the next afternoon, I embarked on the Herculean task of attacking the enclosed bookcase-cum-china cabinet that contains dozens and dozens of paperbacks, several rows deep. This took at least an hour (although some of that was due to the fact that I was enjoyably browsing -- I felt like I discovered the hidden nook of a used bookstore).   But in the end, the search proved fruitless. Frank apparently doesn't own the book - unless he lent it to someone years ago and it was forgotten. So I broke down and spent five bucks at Borders to pick up a paperback copy. I've been reading it little by little the last couple of nights before going to sleep, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. Maybe not enough to plow through someone's bookshelves for an hour, but certainly more than worth five bucks.

      It's a common question people ask around the office, particularly on the day before a three-day weekend: "Got any plans for the weekend?" Usually, when asked that question by overly chatty types in whose web of endless conversation I do not wish to get entangled, I usually say, "Oh, not really," then get back to whatever mundane task they interrupted. When asked by the cool people I enjoy talking to, my answer today has been, "I'm staining some furniture." Not the most obvious task for someone like me, but it's something I've put off long enough, and this weekend's predicted pleasant weather has prompted Liza to suggest that I finally get it done.   I have a nightstand and two monster CD shelving units (I'm in need of a third one that I have yet to purchase) that all possess a rather blah unfinished surface. When I purchased these items at True Value a few years ago, I was in my lengthy "utilitarian" stage. The bachelor look is okay for a while, but jeez, I'm 35, and while I'm currently unmarried (yet happily attached), the rough, unfinished look doesn't really match the decor of my gay, middle-aged roommate. Speaking of Frank, it was actually he who gave me the lowdown on this particular project. Stain, very fine sandpaper, polyurethane...I'll be buying all these very foreign (to me) items tomorrow afternoon, and hopefully things will go smoothly. I'm actually taking my nightstand over to Liza's tonight as we are planning on doing the staining of that particular item on her roofdeck, where we will combine the thoroughly enjoyable view of Liza's quaint North End view with a supposedly manly task that this man -- surprise, surprise -- has yet to conquer. I say "surprise" in the most sarcastic manner...I'm not so much into "guy" things.   Speaking of "non-guy things"...I've been playing the  urlLink new Morrissey album  so much lately it's not funny. I really love it. A lot.

         Don't ask me why it took me so long, but yesterday -- after nearly a month of plowing through it in bits and pieces during subway commutes and bored afternoons off from work -- I finally finished  urlLink "Therapy,"  the latest mystery novel by Jonathan Kellerman. It's my fifth Kellerman book, and although not as enjoyable as his previous one,  urlLink "The Conspiracy Club,"  I still liked it.   As I've mentioned in previous posts, I consider myself a "middlebrow reader." I don't delve into the classics on a regular basis, and even considering something by Pynchon or Delillo gives me a headache (I save my snootiness for music and film). But I do have standards. I don't succumb to romance books, or whatever Oprah approves. One of my favorite genres is crime fiction -- murder mysteries, espionage, that type of thing -- but usually of the slightly higher quality.  urlLink Michael Connelly  is one of my favorites.   Last night, when I told  urlLink Jessica  that I was in the market for a new mystery author, she immediately mentioned a Swedish writer named Henning Mankell. Apparently, Jessica's father (also a Connelly fan) is a big Mankell fan and, what do you know -- our store has a whole bunch of his books. The books take place, naturally, in Sweden, and the main character in all of them is a detective named Kurt Wallander. Last night, I checked out the one book that looked like the earliest in the series,  urlLink "The Dogs of Riga,"  and started reading it. I like it. Mankell has the kind of style that just sucks you right in. His books are all available in the snazzy softcover "QP" style (and have really impressive cover art, courtesy of  urlLink nonstock ). If you're in the market for some good, solid, mystery writing, check this guy out.

      In her most recent post,  urlLink April  reminded us all that last Saturday was  urlLink Morrissey's  45th birthday. I suppose that singing the Smiths' "Unhappy Birthday" is a predictable, yet appropriate way to celebrate.   But that's not all! Today happens to be  urlLink Bob Dylan's  63rd birthday (as opposed to "Bob Dylan's 115th Dream," which is something totally different). Happy birthday, Bob! Now how about treating us to the next batch of those lovely SACD Hybrid remasters, huh?   And last but not least,  urlLink Paul Weller,  also known as The World's Coolest Human, turns 46 tomorrow. You know what would make a nice birthday present for Paul? Some royalties! Buy a bunch of his music. Paul will be happy, and trust me, so will you. It's a win/win situation.

         If you're a fan of jazz music -- the real stuff, not the smooth crap -- you'll be sad to know that the legandary Elvin Jones  urlLink passed away  at the age of 76.  Even if the only thing he did was play drums on John Coltrane's ferocious, groundbreaking  urlLink "A Love Supreme,"  his place in jazz history would still be secure. But he did so much more than that, adding his unique, revolutionary talents to the bulk of Coltrane's recordings, in addition to those of Duke Ellington, Art Pepper, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Charles Mingus and many more.   Despite his recent death, he seemed ageless and played right up until the end (although he had been in poor health in the last few months, according to the above obituary). In his seventies, he continued to tour (I idiotically passed up a chance to see him at the Berklee Performance Center last year) and showed no signs of letting up his manic playing style.   As a jazz fan and someone who took formal drum lessons from ages 10 to 17, I've always been amazed at what Elvin could do with a drum set and an improvisational jazz setting. If you want to hear jazz drumming at its absolute peak, listen to "A Love Supreme," or anything Elvin's recorded.   "I figured that a lot of things drummers were doing with two hands could be done with one," Jones once said. "What was needed was a flow of rhythm all over the set. I never learned any tricks, anything flashy -- like juggling sticks or throwing them in the air. That kind of thing stops me inside. After all, Artur Rubenstein doesn't play runs on the piano with his chin."

         O happy day! Today sees the release of  urlLink "You Are The Quarry,"  Morrissey's first album in seven years. It'll be added to the growing pile of stuff to be reviewed on  urlLink delicious media,  but i have a feeling it'll be given a high priority. I'm dying to hear this. In the meantime,  urlLink read  what Renee Graham of the Boston Globe has to say about it.   Also released today is a long-awaited (for me, anyway) special edition of Alan Parker's 1987 thriller  urlLink "Angel Heart."  The film stars Mickey Rourke, Lisa Bonet and Robert DeNiro (this was back when Rourke was making good movies) and generated tons of controversy upon its theatrical release, due to a graphic sex scene between Rourke and Bonet (thus tarnishing her reputation in the eyes of Denise Huxtable fans). Controversy aside, it's a creepy, effective film noir murder mystery set in 1950s New Orleans. If you choose not to buy it, at least rent it. As Liza's dad would say, "good flick."

      In my opinion, one of the strangest facets of this whole Iraq prison abuse scandal comes to me when I look at the pictures of the soldiers on trial. There's Sgt. Javal S. Davis, the fresh-faced young African-American who probably joined to Army to learn a trade and see the world. Specialist Jeremy C. Sivits looks like he joined at the insistence of his dad, probably a lifer himself. Staff Sgt. Ivan L. Frederick and Specialist Charles A. Graner Jr. look like a couple of supervisors in it for the long haul, cheesy mustaches and all. And let's not forget everyone's favorite piece of white trash, Pfc. Lynndie R. England.  But wait. Who's this? Specialist Megan M. Ambuhl? Why does she not  fit in? Oh, yeah. Probably because every news story shows her  in her friggin' high school yearbook photo.  That's right, while Lynndie dons the sourpuss look in front of the American flag and Jeremy sports shades in his desert cammies, Megan's got the 80s big hair, the standard black dress and is looking "off to the side" like so many yearbook photos are wont to do.   I'm tempted to write a yearbook entry below her picture whenever I see it. Something like,    "Have a great summer! Biology wouldn't have been the same without you! Torture those Iraqis for me, but good! -- Jenny (K.I.T.)  or  "Four years just flew by, didn't they? Remember that time we took all the boys' clothes off in P.E. class and you insisted on taking pictures? You go girl! -- Lisa  Megan, Megan, Megan. So much wasted potential.

      I usually don't have "shitlists," but if I did, Verizon Wireless would certainly be on it. I won't get into a big long explanation about it, because it's a long, hairy story that I'd rather not relive, and I've told it a thousand times in the last 24 hours already. Suffice it to say that Verizon Wireless was, for all intents and purposes, "down" for a good 12 to 18 hours over the weekend and Liza thought I was dead. Literally. Members of my family were also in a bit of a tizzy about the status of my existence. It wasn't pretty. Fortunately, I'm not dead at all and was never even close to it. But Verizon Wireless will wish they were once Liza gets through with them. Believe it.   With enormous help from Liza and Suarez, I finished the Borders GLS over the weekend. That's the monthly listening-station changeout which has become my "thing." I like it. I think I'm pretty good at it. And the best part is, I got to take home a stack of really good music. I have a good half-dozen CDs just waiting to be  urlLink reviewed.  Stay tuned.   Finally, some news I'm pretty happy to share with you all...Suarez finally has a blog. It's called  urlLink intense savagery.  There's really not much there yet, but there will be soon, I just know it. Soon you too can experience the wit and wisdom of Jessica.

      Really, I do. I'm getting a lot accomplished at work today, and it's by no means a "sucky" day, but I'd really like to get the hell out of here and enjoy this lovely weather. The weekend is coming up and I would like to be nowehere near a cubicle for 48 hours. Is that so much to ask?  I must say thanks to  urlLink Sarah  and everyone else who's complimented me on the new "look" of my blog. It was actually designed by the folks at Blogger, but I did in fact choose the design, so I guess you can compliment me on my good taste.   Yesterday one of my bosses at this here  urlLink day job  of mine gave me an American Express gift check for $25 as a way of saying thank you for the extra hours I've been pulling lately in order to get a particularly hairy project accomplished. Nice surprise! Of course, the check didn't go unredeemed for long: at Borders last night, I picked up no less that four CDs (and ended up going over the $25 limit by $11, but oh well...at least the employee discount helped). Now in my possession are:  Jacques Brel:  urlLink Brel  Rockpile:  urlLink Seconds of Pleasure  J. Geils Band:  urlLink Love Stinks  Erik Satie:  urlLink Piano Works  (performed by Michel Legrand)  These discs are all beautiful in their own way, and will most likely all get the review treatment on  urlLink Delicious Media  very soon. One of them this afternoon. Definitely.   And speaking of reviewing and blogging and whatnot, it's my duty to bring you the unfortunate news (unless you already found out from the man himself) that Tom Johnson is retiring his excellent blog,  urlLink Unproductivity.  Tom is an excellent, insightful writer and funny as hell in his own deadpan way. I've enjoyed his posts a great deal, and he was in fact one of my main inspirations for starting this blog. Tom tells me that he will send me the occasional review for posting on Delicious Media, and I will be more than happy to accomodate him in this regard.

      I don't know exactly how it got started, but a little down-time at the office today led me to find something really amazing on the internet. No, not porn. Turns out that's been online for some time now (so they tell me). No, it's called  urlLink The Vintage Keyboard Webring.   I love retro keyboards, particularly from the late sixties and seventies. Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzers, Farfisas, Moogs...and of course, for you prog rockers out there -- the infamous Mellotron. The best part about finding these sites, however, is uncovering photos like  urlLink this.   "Yeah, Bob, I don't think the keyboard you've designed is  dorky-looking  enough. How about painting it the color of Velveeta? Okay? Thanks."

         The uber-knowledgeable folks at  urlLink dvdjournal.com  have just announced that "Goodfellas" will finally be re-released in August, and this time, they're doing it right.   The reason I never bought a DVD of this, one of my all-time favorite films, was because it came out in the early days of the DVD format and contained virtually no bonus material. Even worse, it's a "flipper" (not to be confused with  urlLink this  kind of flipper). Back then, movies that were over a certain length (maybe two-and-a-half hours, I'm not sure) had to be spread out over two sides of a disc, and you had to "flip" them halfway through (early DVD versions of "Amadeus" were flippers, until a nice special edition was released in 2002). Anyway, not only will this edition be one side of the disc, it also contains an extra disc of supplements.   Several other Scorsese films that were released in inferior DVD editions (or never released at all) will come out this summer as well, including "Mean Streets," "Who's That Knocking on My Door," "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and the hilarious, sadly underrated "After Hours" (the only film I know of that stars Teri Garr, Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Linda Fiorentino, Bronson Pinchot  and  Cheech and Chong). You can get them separately or as a box set.  Salud!

      When Outkast told us to "shake it like a Polaroid picture," it was cool. Thousands of dorky white people using it in normal conversation is not. Let's stop that, shall we?  Nuked coffee tastes like crap. Just brew some more, tightwad.   Paul Weller, as a singer, is probably the closest thing the Anglo-Saxon race will ever have to a Reverend Al Green (I stole that line from Michael Sandlin at Pitchfork Media, but it's so true).   Society would benefit greatly if adults could have recess, too.  I'm a peaceful person, but I feel that people who hold up a convenience store line with their scratch card and lottery ticket purchases need to be beaten severely.   It's completely useless to complain about teen pop music. It's always going to be there. Nobody's forcing you to turn on the damn radio. Buy a CD of some of the weirdest shit you can find and who knows, you might like it.   Blockbuster is run by incompetent morons with no taste, no couth, and no sense of adventure. If you want to rent a movie, join Netflix.   More music-buying advice: make your next purchase a classical one. And not some overhyped Bocelli or Yo-Yo Ma disc or something you've heard of, like Vivaldi. Try an avant-garde composer like Messiaen or Webern, or a relatively obscure work by a well-known composer, like Bach's motets. A little variety never hurt anyone.   Fat-free anything tastes like shit.   Men should not wear ponytails. Middle-aged men attempting to halt the aging process by doing this need to have a sit-down with a loved one because they are horribly, horribly misinformed.   People who don't pick up after themselves should be punished severely, perhaps taken to a work-camp where they are forced to give haircuts to the aforementioned ponytail wearers.   The French never did anything to you. Leave them alone. You're just jealous because their food tastes better and they invented Serge Gainsbourg.   There is no compelling argument whatsoever for choosing pan-and-scan over widescreen. Don't even try.

      Well,  I  am, anyway. As I mentioned in my post last week, my local T stop (Savin Hill) closed over the weekend while they demolish it in order to build a sleek, fancy one. Long overdue, I say.   In the meantime, Savin Hill passengers must board a shuttle bus not far from the site of the original subway stop, which takes passengers to the next stop, JFK/UMass. This creates an additional step in the commuting process, but in all honesty, it's going quite smoothly. You just have to make a little more time for it. Also, the shuttle bus stop (on the corner of Dorchester and Savin Hill Avenues) is actually closer to my house than the regular subway stop. So that's cool.   Well, there you go. The T situation is under control, and it seems as though Blogger is getting their upgrade snafus taken care of, little by little. But it still wouldn't hurt if I knew a little HTML.   More reviews are coming soon on  urlLink Delicious Media,  too. Stay tuned.

      As I mentioned earlier, Blogger is implementing huge changes in their service, offering a new look, new, improved features, yada, yada, yada. This is would all be well and good...if the damn thing was working!   Where do I start? Okay, let me give credit where credit is due. The new templates are very spiffy. I like them. That's what reeled me in. But the bad, at this point, is far outweighing the good. To wit:  I can't figure out how to re-publish my links.   I'm not 100 percent sure if my comments feature is working. The comments feature isn't even showing up on Liza's revamped blog. If I do in fact decide to "let anyone post," they have to be Blogger members or else post anonymously (like those ridiculous Diaryland Nazis). A lot of people I know who leave comments don't have Blogger accounts, and many of them don't even have blogs.   I can't figure out how to add links within a post. It doesn't have the "button" that does it for you, and when I try to place the "linking" code in manually, it freaks out in preview.   And don't even get Dan started on how this is affecting *his* blog. Apparently it's affecting April's legendary blog, too. All is not well in Blogger World.   If you happen to read this site and enjoy perusing the currently nonexistent links and leaving witty commentary, please be patient. I'm going to give Blogger the benefit of the doubt and assume they will get things back up to speed before too long. Maybe.

       perhaps the content will improve as well...   Blogger has "relaunched" its services, with a ton of new available templates, their own comments features (so bloggers no longer need to "outsource") and a bunch of other stuff I haven't even started to check out. In the meantime, enjoy my new look. Does this background make me look fat? Are the big dots too pushy? Be honest but keep in mind that I will run crying into the other room if you say the wrong thing.   In time I will reinsert the links, the sitemeter (or maybe not -- it's depressing to see how few people look at this site) and whatever else has been wiped out by choosing a new template. Enjoy! And comment!

       for lack of a creative post...    urlLink Dan  did it,  urlLink Heather  did it, and being the mind-numbing yes-man that I am, here's my take on it:  1. What time do you get up? If I'm going to work, between 5:30 and 6. It often makes me wish I worked from home, but I know for a fact that if I did in fact work from home, I would get absolutely nothing accomplished. Really.  2. If you could eat lunch with one person, who would it be? That's a tough one. If we're talking "alive or dead," probably someone whose art I've always admired, like Kubrick or Zappa (or Bach). But alive? Since I watched several hours of a "Queer Eye" marathon yesterday, I'd say  urlLink Ted Allen.  He's a fabulous cook and seems like a really nice guy to boot.   3. Gold or silver? I don't get it. I'm not much for "bling bling," so let's say neither.   4. What was the last film you saw at the cinema? The Dreamers.  5. What is your favorite TV show? Law & Order.  6. What do you have for breakfast? It depends. There's always a cup of coffee involved, sometimes I have a bowl of cereal, on a Sunday I like to have a big breakfast like bacon, eggs and toast. I don't have a specific "breakfast regimen," but I always try to have something.   7. Who would you hate to be stuck in a room with? Paris Hilton. Or the new security guard they just hired at my Borders -- the guy never shuts up.   8. Who/what inspires you? I have a great admiration for people with enormously positive attitudes, because I'd like to be that way myself. I get too bitter and jaded far too often and would love to change that. I'm also a great admirer of artists who do what they want with little to no regard for public opinion, current trends or mainstream acceptance. Again, the Kubrick/Zappa thing comes to mind.   9. What is your middle name? Rand. It was my father's mother's maiden name and has become a sort of default male middle name in my family (it's also the middle name of my father and one of my nephews). I hated it when I was a kid, but I sort of admire the uniqueness of it nowadays.   10. Beach, city or country? What really irks me about these kinds of lists is that they assume everyone fits into little categories. I like all three of these choices for a variety of different reasons.   11. Favorite ice cream?  I go through phases. Right now I love Starbucks Java Chip.   12. Butter, plain or salted popcorn? Butter and salt, please. And no, I do not want a deluxe "combo" for just 25 cents more.   13. Favorite color? Depends. Growing up it was blue. Then I went through a black phase. Nowadays red's been making me pretty happy.  14. What kind of car do you drive? The nonexistent kind. For pressure drop trivia buffs, the last car I owned was a 1988 Ford Taurus. It was especially fun trying to park that beast in downtown Naples, Italy.   15. Favorite sandwich? I don't think that I have ever, in the 30-plus years that I have ingested solid foods, been disappointed in a grilled cheese sandwich. Helpful tip courtesy of my roommate Frank: grill it with mayo on the bread instead of butter. Yum!  16. What characteristics do you hate in a person? I hate bandwagon-jumping (or general lack of individuality). Lack of sense of humor sucks a lot, too.   17. Favorite flower?  What?  18. If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be? Somewhere I've never been before? I've heard lovely things about New Zealand. And I find it baffling that I've never been to England, so maybe there too.  19. What color is your bathroom? I think it's sort of an off-white affair, with green rugs.   20. Favorite brand of clothing? Hel- lo!  Banana Republic! I'm their biggest straight customer.   21. Where would you retire to?  Somewhere in France.   22. Favorite day of the week? Saturday.   23. What did you do for your last birthday? Liza got us a weekend at the Royal Sonesta in Cambridge. We hung out in Harvard Square, saw a movie, ordered lots of room service, and the rest is none of your business.   24. Where were you born? Winchester, Massachusetts.  25. Favorite sport to watch? Watching sports bores me. Especially baseball and football. If I absolutely had to watch something, I'd make it basketball or soccer.   26. What fabric detergent do you use? This is getting rather personal, don't you think? Tide.   27. Coke or Pepsi? Neither. I don't drink soda unless there's nothing else available, in which case it's ginger ale or Sprite.   28. Are you a morning person or a night owl?  I'm not really either. I love the idea of being awake obscenely early, but I love sleeping too much to really be able to do that.   29. What is your shoe size? 10 1/2  30. Do you have any pets? No, but I have plenty of pet peeves.

       such a thrill when your radials squeal   Well, it happened. It was just a matter of time. I'm a bit disappointed, but really not all that surprised. I've been a fan of seventies-era Queen since, well, the seventies, and their classic  urlLink "I'm In Love With My Car"  has finally been used for a car commercial. Bravo, Jaguar. Thanks for killing a lot of cool memories.

       this one's for my savin hill peeps   The subway stop closest to my house,  urlLink Savin Hill,  is being torn down on May 9 in order for a brand new station to be built in its place. This will make the Savin Hill stop inoperable until January 2005. Despite the inconvenience this places on me as a daily T rider, I welcome the opportunity for this stop -- a foul, smelly, decrepit shack -- to be modernized. My neighborhood deserves it.   Regardless, I'm having a hell of a time trying to figure out what the MBTA is planning to do for those of us who depend on the Savin Hill stop. Flyers have been distributed to the commuters. Apparently, we have to take a shuttle bus (closest stop to my house -- the corner of Dorchester & Savin Hill Avenues) to the JFK/UMass stop and pick up the Red Line there. Fine. No problem.   But I have a thousand other questions. Will they accept the regular T subway pass on this shuttle bus? If not, how much is the fare? How will I know which bus to take, either at the temporary Dorchester Avenue stop or at JFK/UMass when I'm going home? And so on.  So, as part of the MBTA's highly touted "Write to the Top!" program, I fired off an e-mail to the Powers That Be, hoping my various (and not really unusual) questions could be answered. A few days later (this afternoon), I get an e-mail that, at first glance, can't be a form letter, since it begins, "Dear Mr. Ingalls." Unfortunately, the e-mail they sent me includes the same facts included in their hand-out flyers. Not exactly what I had in mind. Don't you just love bureaucracy?  So if anyone knows the deal with these Savin Hill shuttle bus things, please let me know.

       so nice they named it twice   My  urlLink Netflix  adventures continue to go along smoothly. I'm still slogging through the Ric Burns  urlLink "New York"  miniseries. So far, of the eight episodes, I've watched 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. Perhaps I should explain. When I first received episode 5, it was damaged, so I returned it. In the meantime, 7 showed up, and I didn't feel like waiting around for 6 or the replacement disc for 5. Last night I watched my new copy of episode 5. I'll watch 6 tonight. Confused? Sorry. Episode 8, which I should be getting on Friday, is a post-9/11 World Trade Center special that was posthumously added to the documentary (which first aired in 1999). I think they'll do a great job with it, but I still get the creeps watching anything related to the Towers.   The series has been a total joy for me. I've never been much of an expert on New York City, but now I feel like I know the place (and its history) like the back of my hand. I've also enjoyed the commentary by brilliant New York historians like Robert Caro, Mike "not the 60 Minutes guy" Wallace, Ray Suarez, and the very strange-looking Marshall Berman (who really needs to do something about his frazzled hippie appearance - can we get the Fab Five on the case?).   I also learned a lot about post-war urban renewal and the destructive, out-of-control Robert Moses. Being generally lax in large chunks of our nation's history, I was shocked to learn of this man's destructive path through New York City, building highways and wiping out entire neighborhoods as casually as blowing his nose. This is the guy who created the borough-destroying Cross Bronx Expressway, and tried to get a highway to run straight through Manhattan, virtually wiping out Greenwich Village, until cooler heads finally intervened. This is also the guy who brought down Penn Station. What a story. My history-nut roommate Frank informed me that Moses started out with good intentions, but eventually wielded so much power that his highway expansion pipe dreams were almost unanimously approved every time, with little dissent or regard for displacement of families or businesses.   I personally have never really spent any time in New York City, with the exception of driving through it a few times (although I did spent about two years of my toddler era outside of Greenwich, Connecticut, so it's quite possible that I've been in the Empire State Building and nobody ever told me -- Dad, if you're reading this, could you clarify?). Liza may be spending some time in NYC this summer with our friend Briana (who "represents" Brooklyn, big ups yo), and I may spend a weekend there. I can't wait! I can't believe it's taken me this long to get there.

      Am I the only one who finds those post-spiderhole pictures of  urlLink Saddam Hussein  vaguely humorous? No, not the ones where he looks like Charles Manson; I'm talking about the ones where he's been cleaned up. They've got his hair all trimmed and he's wearing a white t-shirt and what appears to be some sort of casual windbreaker.   It's all the more unusual when you consider that he used to be photographed in front of ecstatic crowds while firing a rifle into the air, or sitting at a conference table puffing a cigar and wearing a tailored suit while petrified yes-men hang on his every word. Now he looks like some dude you'd run into while taking out the garbage in your suburban cul-de-sac. "Honey? I just ran into Saddam at the Stop & Shop! You know Saddam, our neighbor? We were talking about last night's Gilmore Girls. It was a repeat but he hadn't seen it..."

      It looks like Dick Cheney's reputation as an artery-clogged loose canon is  urlLink secure.   Here's my favorite part of the story:  "That doesn't sound like language the vice president would use. But there was a frank exchange of views," said a Cheney spokesman, Kevin Kellums.  So that's it then. From now on, "frank exchange of views" is the official euphemism for "swearing like a truckdriver."

          urlLink Wilco  is currently working on a 160-page "picture book," described as "a visual equivalent of the band's music." Judging by their last couple of albums, this is going to be one fucked-up book. And I want it. More information can be found  urlLink here.  The book will also feature a CD with 40 minutes of previously unreleased Wilco music. Did I mention that I want this?  Dave H., my trusted music supervisor at Borders (not to mention the one guy besides my brother with whom I can engage in discussions about music for hours) made nice with our store's  urlLink Nonesuch  rep and scored me a free promo copy of Wilco's latest,  urlLink  A Ghost is Born  , because he knew I really wanted it. Thanks, Dave! I listened to most of it on the way to work this morning and I really like it. I've already heard most of it due to the fact that it's been streaming on the band's website for at least a month now, but listening to the album through tinny computer speakers is no match for a nice pair of headphones and copious liner notes. Like their previous album,  urlLink  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  , it's an odd collection of music, but odder in a different way. Kind of hard to explain, but I'm going to attempt to review it over on   urlLink Delicious Media  as soon as I've digested it to my satisfaction. I know, that site's languishing a bit, but several recent music acquisitions should change that very soon.

         The long-awaited new album from  urlLink Wilco  comes out tomorrow, and my long-awaited pre-ordered special two-disc edition of  urlLink Mike Keneally's  latest should be in my mailbox in the next week (or so), but that hasn't stopped me from buying even  more  new music.   Case in point:  urlLink  To the 5 Boroughs  , the latest, long-awaited release from the Beastie Boys. I picked it up Saturday afternoon and listened to almost all of it, and so far I really enjoy it. I don't consider myself a huge BB fan, but I do enjoy their stuff. I'm not really much of a hip-hop fan -- I consider most of the genre's masochistic, materialistic posing to be boring and predictable -- but every once in a while, a group comes along that makes it interesting and refreshing. De La Soul, the Roots, Jurassic Five and Outkast are a few examples of those types of "exceptions to the rule."  What I like best about the Beastie Boys (King Ad-Rock, Mike D and MCA) is that they're so damn geeky. Even while pretending to come off as tough, you can't shake the fact that they're three upper-middle class Jewish white boys. I didn't always like them, though. I was a senior in high school when their debut,  License to Ill,  came out. Not a day would go by when that song wasn't blasting from the school parking lot or being quoted by some hipster doofus classmate. I hated it.   Fortunately, the Boys thickened up the sound considerably with their follow-up,  Paul's Boutique,  which I bought and played endlessly and still love to this day. Of course, it tanked with the public. What else is new? (It should be noted that it's been critically lauded since day one and still maintains its status as an underappreciated classic).   The Beastie Boys have continued their high quality of dorky white boy rhymes, teaming up with endlessly creative producers like the Dust Brothers and Mario Caldato, Jr, as well as utility player Money Mark. Perhaps influencing later hip-hop  musicians  like the Roots, the Beastie Boys went back to their DIY punk roots by playing their own instruments on the groundbreaking  Check Your Head.   Further establishing their reputation as intelligent multi-taskers (while still being smart-ass rappers), the Boys started their own record label (and magazine), Grand Royal, and MCA (born Adam Yauch) began making his social conscience heard by organizing the hugely successful Tibetan Freedom Concerts. Maybe white rap isn't so bad after all.   There have been some criticisms of  To the 5 Boroughs , mainly the fact that these three, on the cusp of their forties, have outlived their usefulness and have nothing new to add to the genre. Bullshit. Listen to the album. It's a predictable cliche to refer to any album that pleads for peace, love and unity as a "post 9/11 statement," but that's exactly what that is. Songs like "Time to Build" and "An Open Letter to NYC" are potent, pertinent, and totally on point. They still sound great and have a lot to say. And the music still sounds great. And wow, I love that packaging. A nice textured O-card that doubles as a tribute to their shattered yet resilient hometown.

      Ten years ago this week (I'm not sure of the actual day, but I know it was mid-June), I was discharged from the navy after serving for seven years. A lot has changed.  I'm not getting paid to travel to exotic locales anymore, the government is no longer paying my bills, and I can technically be fired for not doing my job well. But other than that, I think things are a lot better for me now.   I joined the navy in 1987, during the latter half of my senior year in high school, when I was feeling particularly aimless and had no immediate plans to further my education beyond a high school diploma. On a Saturday afternoon in February, when my father suggested the service, I have to admit that I laughed. He couldn't be serious!  But he wasn't smiling. "Oh, you really want me to do this?" I asked him (although probably to myself). I have to admit, the idea sounded interesting to me. I honestly didn't feel any need to "serve my country" and I was already a confirmed liberal and not interested in "killing commies." But in a rush of "here goes nothing" nihilism, I said sure.   There were a few conditions. First of all, I was determined to enjoy my last summer of freedom first, and wouldn't actually go to boot camp until at least mid-August. Second, I would choose a job field that would interest me. I picked journalism. It's fun, and hey -- something I can use on the outside when my time is up. I hate to break it to you, Popeye, but there's not much call for a "Botswain's Mate" in 21st century America.   So in August 1987 I entered navy basic training at the Recruit Training Center in Great Lakes, Illinois, followed by 10 months at the amazingly challenging yet pleasantly alcohol-fueled Defense Information School (in Indiana, but since moved to Maryland), then two surreal years at the Navy Broadcasting Service detachment in Diego Garcia (a British island in the middle of the Indian Ocean -- you can see photos of the place on  urlLink this  nice unofficial site).   My final three-and-a-half years of service were spent at the NBS detachment in Keflavik, Iceland, where I continued to subvert the radio airwaves, be a dumb military TV news reporter, honed my videotape editing skills, mastered the art of the public service announcement, learned how to drive on black ice, caught my girlfriend in bed with another guy, directed the only one-take prerecorded TV newscast in the history of the station (Marc Boyd said he did one shortly after me, but I heard he cheated), rode in a helicopter for the first time, was the subject of a brief rumor that I was gay, learned how to drive a stick shift, got married (and divorced several years later), became a dad, got a fancy certificate that proves I crossed the arctic circle, and met a few of my best friends ever: Jamie Salafia, Terry Welch, and that lovable doofus, Gerard Johnson (does anyone know where he is these days?).  My time in the navy was spent dealing with some pretty conservative, middle-of-the-road types with whom I tried to argue and realized it was pointless (they were also pretty big Wrasslin' fans), but I was also lucky enough to be in a little corner of the military where people often thought daring and original thoughts, questioned authority and voted Democrat. DINFOS grads will never let you down.   I had a great time, saw a lot of interesting things, laughed my ass off, and drank a lot of booze...but I got out when I'd had enough (which is more than I can say for some people I knew).   To paraphrase  urlLink Mike Keneally,  1994 was a million years ago.

      This has been making my morning commute a lot more tolerable lately:     What a fun little page-turner. Highly recommended. Oh, and I watched  urlLink "L'Auberge Espagnole"  last night -- my latest Netflix rental -- and enjoyed it a lot, despite the fact that the main character was evidently supposed to be a likeable guy but did a few asshole things that made me not like him so much. Oh, and don't be deceived by the fact that Audrey "Amelie" Tautou's face is plastered on the center of the DVD cover. She's only in a handful of scenes (although her character does in fact play a pivotal role) and it's obvious that the cover design was the brainchild of a marketing department intent on cashing in on the success of "Amelie." Overall, though, a very entertaining film.   Next on the Netflix queue:  urlLink "Andrei Rublev,"   urlLink "Frida"  and  urlLink "Waiting For Guffman"  (believe it or not, I still haven't seen that film, which is surprising, given how much I love Christopher Guest. Finally, when someone quotes that film, I can do more than give them a vacant stare).

      Attention, fellow bloggers: I would appreciate it greatly if you could please stop posting results from those moronic "Which ____ Are You?" quizzes.  What makes this difficult is that bloggers I like and respect continue to participate in these dumb things. I don't care which Gilligan's Island character you are, which philosopher you are, which 80s fashion faux pas you are, which Sanford & Son character you are, which unnatural sexual position you are...it's officially no longer entertaining.

      What I mean by that title is "various types of media -- music, movies -- that I would like to hype for you right now."  Getting most of  urlLink my store's  listening station change-out completed over the weekend has given me the opportunity to become the owner of lots of free CDs. How I love my part-time job.   First things first: drop everything at once and buy  urlLink "Her Majesty the Decemberists"  by the Decemberists. This is a wonderful album. I'm not sure how to classify it. I guess these guys have an "indie" bent to their music, but it also has a rather folky side to it, and the intricate storytelling and unique instrumentation almost lends itself to -- here it comes -- prog rock. I find it a rare joy to come across a band making truly original music without any sort of cookie-cutter sound. Bravo. I plan on reviewing this one over on  urlLink Delicious Media  sometime soon.   I also picked up the self-titled debut album by  urlLink Rooney,  which hasn't really clicked with me yet, but hopefully will; the two-disc deluxe edition of Weezer's  urlLink debut "blue" album , which is a beautiful thing; and the latest from Modest Mouse,  urlLink "Good News For People Who Love Bad News,"  which I haven't heard yet in its entirety, but sounds excellent so far.   But that's not all!  urlLink "Neruda"  by Luciana Souza is a really lovely album, as is  urlLink "Opera Arias"  by Anna Netrebko, and various other classical discs I managed to scoop up.   Lastly, I haven't really had the chance to listen to my newly acquired copy of  urlLink "In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth,"  the latest release from neo-prog-metal Coheed & Cambria. It may be completely not up my alley whatsoever, but I'm going to give it a chance, and if I don't like it, I'll pass it on to Scott, a Borders co-worker who lives for that kind of stuff.   What else? Oh, Friday night Liza and I went to see  urlLink "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."  Despite the fact that I dozed off briefly (I was pretty tired), it was quite enjoyable. I don't love the whole Harry Potter thing as much as Liza -- she's read all the books -- but I do appreciate the fact that J.K. Rowling is getting kids interested in reading, and let's face it: the films are fun. I saw the first one (but not the second), and I have to go with the general consensus that Alfonso Cuaron is taking the franchise in much more interesting directions than Chris "Home Alone" Columbus.  Finally, my  urlLink Netflix  membership kept me very entertained last night with two films that are well worth your time. The first,  urlLink "13 Conversations About One Thing,"  was simply incredible, thought-provoking, and just plain wonderful. The best description I can give for this film is that it's as if  urlLink David Mamet  directed  urlLink "My Dinner With Andre."  There. Take that and run with it. Also, I began watching  urlLink "Blue Car,"  based on an extremely positive  urlLink review  from Roger Ebert. I'm about an hour into it (I'm watching the rest tonight). It stars  urlLink David Strathairn  as an English teacher who dangerously pines for one of his high school students. Strathairn is one of those actors whose name you probably wouldn't recognize, but you've seen him in countless films (he was the film producer in  urlLink "L.A. Confidential,"  the abusive husband and father in  urlLink "Dolores Claiborne,"  the blind audio technician in the highly underrated  urlLink "Sneakers,"  and so on).   Also, I started reading  urlLink "Red Dragon"  by Thomas Harris, simply because I feel like getting the shit scared out of me, and was told that book would do the trick.

      Interesting news for Joe Jackson fans...a  urlLink tribute album  of Joe's songs, performed entirely by female and/or female-led bands, is slated for release later this year.   Although I've only heard of one of the acts listed (Mary Lee's Corvette -- they opened for Joe on one of the shows I saw last year) -- I'd really like to hear this. Joe is an incredible songwriter whose catalog is ripe for interpretation.

         The word "genius" is thrown around so much these days, but this is one case where it fits. Ray Charles, along with Bo Diddley, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry, basically invented rock and roll.   He was also one of the first true multifaceted talents of the genre. He blended pop, rock, soul, gospel, jazz, and even country, and made it all seem so easy. There are few people even today who possess his eclecticism.   Just a sampling of his repertoire -- "What'd I Say," "Hit the Road, Jack," "Busted," "I Can't Stop Loving You," "Georgia on my Mind," "Hallelujah, I Love Her So," "Drown in My Own Tears" -- reads like a list of rock's most essential songs.   Every once in a while, a gentle soul comes into the world and creates beautiful, timeless art. Ray Charles did just that, and while he will be deeply missed, we'll always have his music.  Stupid, pointless story that for some reason, I feel a need to share in this post: Back in 1988 or 1989, I was making a mix tape. I have some pretty anal-retentive rules about mixes and one of them is that I never do more than one song by an artist. Anyway, I had just put "Hallelujah, I Love Her So" by Ray Charles on the tape and I realized that there were only a couple minutes left. I then concluded the mix with Ray's "Drown In My Own Tears." Later, when my roommate and I were listening to the tape, he remarked -- fully aware of my rules -- that there were two songs in a row by the same artist. "It's okay," I told him. "It's Ray Charles."   "His music is way beyond marketing. This music is global, and its appeal is universal. Ray Charles changed music just by being himself -- by doing what he did and translating it to millions of people with the wide-ranging effect of his one-of-a-kind soul. That's his legacy. I think that the music of Ray Charles will probably outlive us all -- at least I hope that it will." - Van Morrison

       urlLink Doug  posted this on his blog (and he found it  urlLink here ), now I'm going to do the same. Feel free to copy the questions and put them on your own blog, if you're so inclined.   1. Your favorite song with the name of a city in the title or text.  Roadrunner by Jonathan Richman. (it's the real Boston anthem, not that Dirty Water crap).   2. A song you've listened to repeatedly when you were depressed at some point in your life.  I cant think of a song in particular where I actually did that, but if you want a fun, carefree, upbeat song, try Were Not Deep by the Housemartins.   3. Ever bought an entire album just for one song and wound up disliking everything but that song? Gimme that song.   Severe Tire Damage  by They Might Be Giants contains, in my opinion, one decent song (Why Does the Sun Shine?). Thats not why I bought the album, but this is the best answer I could come up with.   4. A great song in a language other than English.  Jaures by Jacques Brel or Sotto Le Stelle Del Jazz by Paolo Conte.  5. Your least favorite song on one of your favorite albums of all time.  Luxembourg is the only song on Elvis Costellos  Trust  album that I dont love with all my heart.   6. A song you like by someone you find physically unattractive or otherwise repellent.  Most of the music I listened to is composed and performed by ugly people. Apostrophe by Frank Zappa is an instrumental that was co-written by Jim Gordon (who played drums on the song), and he was later convicted of bludgeoning his mom with an ax, and thats repellent. So there.   7. Your favorite song that has expletives in it that's not by Liz Phair.  Im going to have to go with a Frank Zappa song. For sheer gleeful shock value, nothing beats Stick it Out.  8. A song that sounds as if it's by someone British but isn't.  Well, the obvious answer is anything by Spinal Tap. Strange question.   9. A song you like (possibly from your past) that took you forever to finally locate a copy of.  Up All Night by Boomtown Rats. Its originally from their album  V Deep,  which has been out of print for a while. I still dont have it  Ive seen it on a really bad eighties compilation that Im not sure I want to buy just for that song.   10. A song that reminds you of spring but doesn't mention spring at all.  The orchestral version of If I Could by Erasure (from their album  The Two-Ring Circus ).   11. A song that sounds to you like being happy feels.  Live in Japan by Mike Keneally.  12. Your favorite song from a non-soundtrack compilation album.  Level the Vibes by Half-Pint, from an obscure reggae compilation called  Reggae Jamdown  the RAS Tapes.  I lent the CD to someone in 1990, just a few months after I bought it, and I never got it back. Nowadays its impossible to find.   13. A song that reminds you of high school.  Its impossible to isolate this to one album, let alone one song. How about anything from   King of America  by Elvis Costello or  Labour of Lust  by Nick Lowe.   14. A song that reminds you of college.  Never went to college, but I did attend military broadcast journalism school (The Defense Information School, or DINFOS) from Oct. 1987 to Aug. 1988. Its basically college in a military uniform. There are about five million songs that remind me of my time there, but lets just say The Walk by the Cure.   15. A song you actually like by an artist you otherwise dislike.  I have a strenuous dislike for anything involving Madonna, but I have to admit that I like Ray of Light. Dont tell anyone.   16. A song by a band that features three or more female members.  Riding on the Rocket by Shonen Knife.   17. One of the earliest songs that you can remember listening to.  Lean on Me by Bill Withers. My dad used to love that song.   18. A song you've been mocked by friends for liking.  Most of my friends mock me for my love of prog rock. Fuck em.   19. A really good cover version you think no one else has heard.  Im a big fan of obscure covers, particularly if theyre wildly rearranged. I love Wilson Picketts version of Hey Jude, John Wesley Hardings version of Like a Prayer, Graham Parkers version of A Change is Gonna Come, Frank Zappas version of Stairway to Heaven, Joe Jacksons version of Any Major Dude (never recorded, he performed it on his last tour), the Jams  version of In the Midnight Hour and many many more.   20. A song that has helped cheer you up (or empowered you somehow) after a breakup or otherwise difficult situation.  Normally anything by Mike Keneally makes me very happy, not just because his music is upbeat (although a lot of it is), but because he has a love for music that comes through in everything he does and is absolutely infectious.

         Lou Reed has lots of rabid fans who know his classic albums by heart. "Transformer." "Berlin." "The Blue Mask." As for me, the one Reed album I have memorized (or  did,  some 19 years ago) is the obscure and uncharacteristically upbeat "New Sensations."  June, 1985. I was living in Orlando and about to finish my sophomore year in high school. One of my best friends, Mike Lee, taped a copy of this album for me. I spent that summer (like all of my high school summers) staying with my mom in Derry, New Hampshire, enjoying her apartment complex swimming pool and spending a couple of weeks visiting my sister Julie in Boston. This cassette was definitely in heavy rotation on the old Walkman.   Coming from a guy who normally sang songs about heroin and drag queens, this was an odd album. It was radio friendly (yet full of nice crunchy guitar riffs). Positive. Almost... uplifting.  I remember wandering the streets of downtown Boston listening to "Endlessly Jealous" and wishing I wrote that song. I loved the eloquent, soul-searching title track, the achingly beautiful "Fly Into the Sun" and the gleeful "I Love You, Suzanne." Lou seemed to be comfortable in his early forties. And I was loving it.   Unfortunately, "New Sensations" appears to only be available these days as an import, but if you see it around, I recommend picking it up. It was one of the highlights of my summer of '85.

         This is an album that my sister Julie bought in 1977 or 1978 when we lived in France. The artist, a singer named France Gall, first hit it big in the mid-sixties as a teen pop sensation, and continued to release albums through the seventies and beyond (this album was released in 1977). The only thing I remember about this album was the song "Musique," which got a lot of airplay in our house for some reason. I actually like this cover. It's very evocative of a Parisian "night on the town," and the logo on the ashtray of the couple doing "the hustle" is very much of its time.   What do  you  think?

      While I feel deep sorrow for Nancy Reagan and her family, and applaud the fact that she stood by her husband during the many years he struggled with Alzheimer's disease (not to mention the fact that she blew off the Christian Right by supporting stem-cell research), I agree with  urlLink April  that the media is blowing Reagan's death  way  out of proportion. He died. He was 93 years old. He's been out of office for more than 15 years. Let's move on.   And I'm not going to pretend I liked the guy. Let's face it: Reagan left public office with the country three trillion dollars in debt,  and  completely blew off the AIDS epidemic. I've known people who died of AIDS. I'm not going to pretend this guy  didn't  stand by while people succumbed to a disease he cared nothing about. Meanwhile, they're talking about  putting his face on the ten dollar bill?  And don't get me started on the whole Mount Rushmore thing.   Death is a sad, sad thing. But let someone who liked the guy deliver a eulogy.

       urlLink Dan  remarked on his blog that this Sunday, June 6, is the 60th anniversary of D-Day. June 6 is also the anniversary of my failed marriage. Coincidence? I doubt it.   That's right folks, if I were still married, it would be 12 years this Sunday. Then again, if I were still married, I would be foaming at the mouth, mumbling something about the Apocalypse, and would only be allowed to write with crayons.   Bitter, me? No way.

      Its been something like six days since I last commented on how much I love the new Morrissey album. The last time I was so chatty about a musical purchase was when Joe Jackson released Vol. 4, his comeback album. I guess you could call You Are The Quarry a comeback for Morrissey, too (it's his first album in seven years). What I originally thought of as a strong album a couple of weeks ago (when I first heard it) is now a flat-out masterpiece. I could go down a laundry list of what I like about it, butaw hell, why not? Here is said laundry list:  The loud, distorted guitars in You Know I Couldnt Last (my current favorite song on the album  you know its a good album when your favorite song changes regularly)  The flute (or is it a recorder?) solo in Im Not Sorry, which is so un-Morrissey but so perfect  The minor-key electric piano riff that runs through I Have Forgiven Jesus  That totally wack-ass electronic sound that opens All The Lazy Dykes  The line such a silly boy (and the way its delivered) on The First of the Gang To Die  That little falsetto part at the end of Come Back to Camden  and finally, the one thing I do  not  like about the album:  That damn inconvenient gatefold sleeve that will not fit in my CD rack. Jesus, Morrissey! What possessed you to design that? Thats right, Im talking to you! The credits say that you designed it yourself. I have nothing against paper/cardboard Digipaktype packaging. But the proportions of this thing are so wrong.   My obsession with this album has given me the opportunity to dive back into Morrisseys catalog with unabashed glee and utter concentration. I plan to purchase the two albums I previously passed on (his mid-nineties titles Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted) as well as a more thorough examination of the Smiths, the band I fell in love with the summer after high school graduation, cavorting around Florida with my best friends in bad quasi-bohemian mod/punk fashions with big hair and vodka tonics. Ah, memories.

      Bill Cosby's in the spotlight once again, and not for creating a new sitcom. Recent remarks he made at a Washington, D.C. gala commemorating the 50th anniversary of  Brown v. Board of Education  have created a firestorm of controversy, mostly in the African-American community.   On the surface, he may have come off as misinformed, insensitive, or just plain senile, but in my opinion the Cos made some good points. Renee Graham of the Boston Globe thinks so, too, and today's installment of her "Life in the Pop Lane" column makes for essential reading.  urlLink Check it out.

      I have a confession to make. Ive always loved those big, wanky rock reference books that crowd the music sections of bookstores. In the days of my youth, my brother Gary used to buy books like  The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock  and  The Rolling Stone Record Guide.  This was back when  Rolling Stone  was an informative, somewhat respectable magazine, mind you, before they became an offshoot of  Maxim . Additionally, I loved poring over  Rolling Stone  every month, even reading reviews of bands I didnt care for  just admiring the writing and pontificating  and hearing stories about bands on the road (Almost Famous was a particularly poignant film for me).   Anyway, I loved these books, and in a rather guilty-pleasure-nostalgic way, still do (although my tastes have broadened somewhat to include jazz and classical reference books, I might add). One of my favorite 1982 Christmas gifts was a book given to me by my mother entitled Rock Chronicles, basically a 365-page this day in rock music history guide.   So it should come as no surprise that I really want  urlLink this book.  My brother bought the first edition back in 1982, and Im assuming that this is a heavily updated version. Why do I like stuff like this? Easy. Some people are students of military history. Some revel in political history. Me, I love rock music history. I eat that shit up. I love reading about histories of various bands, who released what album when, how old so-and-so was when they keeled over from too much smackyou name it. If you know me, you know that the need to fill my head with useless music trivia must constantly be fed.   Oh, and these books also make for great bathroom reading. No plots to mull over, just open it up anywhere and read away.

         I love this. And I'll get to it in a minute.    The 2004 Democratic National Convention didn't officially start until today, but you could have fooled me. What with a phalanx of security surrounding the Fleet Center and more confused tourists than usual, our fair city was given a taste of what kind of madness the next few days have in store.   I tried to make the best of it, killing time Saturday afternoon (while Liza was at dance practice) visiting "the competition," a.k.a. Virgin Megastore. Sure, their prices are a bit higher and they definitely have more of a "corporate" vibe, but their classical CD selection is pretty damn sweet. I picked up a Naxos budget version of Schubert's  urlLink "Winterreise"  as well as yet another title in Sony's wonderful Glenn Gould/Bach reissue program (  urlLink "English Suites, Vol.1,"  if you must know).   While spending more than an hour scanning and sampling various titles in the store, the umistakable sounds of Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier" began wafting through the store's classical section. This was a version I hadn't heard previously, and after checking out the "now playing" display on the desk, I noticed that it was a new  urlLink version  from the wonderful  urlLink ECM  label. I made a note of it and decided to purchase it at Borders, where I could get an employee discount (turns out that disc isn't even in our system yet, so I ended up paying full-price for it at Tower in Harvard Square the next day -- I'm so inpatient). If you're familiar with this piece of music and would like to hear a stunning new version, or would like to be introduced to something new to you but in a stunning way...did that make sense? Anyway, you should get this.   I almost forgot! After being in full-on  urlLink Weezer  mode after making that mix for Audrey, I picked up a super-cheap copy of  urlLink "Video Capture Device,"  a fantastic Weezer DVD that features all their music videos, plus rare stuff and tons of hilarious audio commentary from the boys in the band (minus the ever-elusive Rivers Cuomo). This is a must for even the casual fan.      Yay! This is pretty cool too.   Liza and I slept in obscenely late on Sunday (for us, anyway) and then proceded to Harvard Square for a sort-of brunch at the Greenhouse Coffee House, followed by a Loews Harvard Square screening of  urlLink "The Bourne Supremacy."  I have to tell you, this Bourne franchise is turning out to be pretty damn cool. I'm not a huge fan of action movies (with several notable exceptions), but I'm always a sucker for international spy stuff. I loved everything about this movie (I also loved the first one, which I recently purchased and watched with Liza so the experience could be fresh in our minds for the sequel). Highly recommended.   Hey, if you're not doing anything tonight, how about checking out "cARTer," my friend Eric Wolfson's exhibit of Jimmy Carter paintings? The official opening is at 9 p.m. at Zuzu's in Central Square (in Cambridge).

      About a month ago, I told myself ( urlLink and all of you ) that I would be making a Weezer mix disc for my eleven-year-old daughter Audrey (who lives in Illinois with my ex-wife, for those of you unfamiliar with this blog's cast of characters). We have practically zero common ground when it comes to music, and I'm a firm believer in letting kids listen to what they want instead of forcing your "old fart" tastes on them -- but since she's already starting to get into these guys, I figured a nice compilation would be fun.  Well, I made the mix shortly afterwards, but kept putting off making some artwork for the thing. Thanks to some office software, I put a nice little action shot of Rivers Cuomo on the front, along with a track listing and graphics on the actual disc that mirror that of Weezer's "Blue" album (I even used the Weezer "font"). Looks pretty decent, if I do say so myself. And the songs? Twenty-four tracks of crunchy, sugary Weezer goodness:  1  my name is jonas 2  buddy holly 3  say it ain't so 4  in the garage 5  holiday 6  mykel and carli 7  suzanne 8  jamie 9  getchoo 10 no other one 11 why bother 12 the good life 13 don't let go 14 photograph 15 island in the sun 16 crab 17 knock down drag out 18 smile 19 american gigolo 20 dope nose 21 keep fishin' 22 burnt jamb 23 fall together 14 possibilities  A few points to make: first of all, I don't really have much in the form of Weezer b-sides or rarities, except for the two-disc deluxe edition of the Blue Album (which is where I got tracks 6-8). So if you don't see the KROQ Weenie Roast Speed Metal version of a previously unreleased song that Rivers wrote on the tour bus that only 15 people have ever heard, that's because I don't really have much of that stuff.   Also, since this is, after all, for my eleven-year-old daughter, I am being a (sigh) responsible parent by avoiding songs with "questionable" lyrical content. Unfortunately, that means bypassing personal favorites like "Tired of Sex," "Across the Sea" and "El Scorcho" (the  Pinkerton  album kinda got the short shrift as a result).   Other than that, I think it's a pretty decent mix if I do say so myself.

      Fuckin' NBC. First, they cancel  urlLink "Homicide: Life on the Street,"  easily one of the most original, well-written and well-acted cop shows in the history of television, then they do the same thing a few years later to a similarly high-quality show like  urlLink "Boomtown."   I normally don't go out of my way to catch a new prime-time TV show, and "Boomtown" was no exception when it debuted in 2002. I saw a shitload of ads for it, and one Sunday night, when I was bored and decided to just channel-surf for a little while, I happened upon this show. My immediate reaction was, "Oh, this is that dumb cop show with Donnie Wahlberg that I've heard so much about." Then I kept watching. And watching. And wouldn't you know it, I was hooked.   This was a good show. A great one, in fact. The characters were well-defined, the plots intricately constructed to show the entire cast -- the cops, the lawyers, the reporters, and yes, the criminals, using flashbacks and other non-linear forms of storytelling. It was high-quality TV viewing, more suited to HBO than NBC.   Liza and I became addicted to this show, and not in a "watching a train wreck" type of addiction that you might get from drivel like "Fear Factor" or "The Apprentice." We tuned in almost every Sunday night (right after "Law & Order: Criminal Intent," making for a nice one-two punch of police drama).   Then, suddenly, I saw a story on CNN that talked about TV shows that were "on the bubble," in other words, shows whose future was uncertain as far as being renewed for another season. "Boomtown" was one of those shows (I  urlLink lamented  the situation on this blog more than a year ago). I was surprised, not because a quality show was possibly getting axed (that happens all the time), but because I was under the impression that "Boomtown" was a big hit. Apparently not. Maybe in my household, but I guess too many people were hooked on "Who Wants To Marry My Cousin's Best Friend" or "Celebrity Blind Date Mole 14."   I believe that "Boomtown" (like "Homicide" and the similiarly brushed-off "Freaks and Geeks") was more suited for a channel like HBO or Showtime. These "pay" stations nurture a show and give it time to grow, instead of re-tooling the cast, dumbing down the writing and finally cancelling it for good (three things that happened to "Boomtown").  What I'm really trying to say (and it's taking me a lot of time and plenty of venting to say it) is that "Boomtown" is now available on DVD. Buy it, rent it, get it from   urlLink Netflix  -- however you can swing it, experience what network TV can really be with good writing and good performances.

      Those of you who belong to  urlLink friendster  may also want to consider  urlLink my space , which is basically a sassier version of friendster. I've got myself an  urlLink account  there and you should, too. Head on over and tell 'em I sent you.

      Usually, when I send an e-mail and it gets kicked back due to a mistyped address or an account that is no longer valid, I get a curt, detached message along the lines of:   MAIL FAILURE. Unable to reach sender. Attempt failed.    But an e-mail I just tried to send to an Excite account (I didn't even realize those existed anymore) came back with this pleasant, chatty, sympathetic note:   I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses. This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.   Wow. "Sorry it didn't work out?" Why, thank you, Excite. I appreciate your concern. I'll get over it.

      There are two things you can always count on when it comes to  urlLink They Might Be Giants : really good songs and intelligent, incisive interviews. John Flansburgh -- the generally more chatty half of the duo -- is featured in a web-exclusive  urlLink Newsweek interview.  Two quotes in particular were quite meaningful to me:   "Popular music as its own self-contained worldlike the world our older brothers and sisters enjoyed while looking at the liner notes of whatever mid-70s recordis really fading out."    "MTV needs to climb out of their teeny-bop ghetto, dust themselves off and get back to the business of new wave."   Amen and amen.

         Spending five years of my childhood in France was indeed a trip. Not only was I cut off from a good deal of American culture, I was exposed to a lot of extracurricular childhood activities that my U.S. counterparts didn't even know existed. Sure, there were impromptu neighborhood soccer matches, but there was also a treasure trove of European comics and children's books. I devoured the stories of Tintin, not to mention Asterix and the lesser-known Lucky Luke, and fell completely in love with a book called  urlLink "Le Petit Nicolas,"  a collection of stories from the point of view of a Parisian grade school troublemaker.   My brother and I both read the book (at least twice) and used to enjoy comparing what parts of the book made us laugh the most. Like most of my old Tintin and Asteix books, I still have my original copy of "Le Petit Nicolas," although it's tattered beyond belief.   The book was written by the late, great Rene Goscinny, who wrote most of the Asterix books (before he passed away and Asterix' illustrator, Albert Uderzo, began writing them, though not nearly as well). The book manages to capture both the innocence and deviousness of childhood in a way that kids will want to have Nicolas as a friend, and adults will nod in recognition at the antics.

      Eric Wolfson is a good friend of mine. We work together at  urlLink Borders.  He has excellent taste in music. He's also a very talented artist. In fact, he has an exhibit coming up that you should really check out. It's called "cARTer" and is a collection of his paintings of Jimmy Carter. Yeah. Our 39th president. The show opens Monday, July 26 at 9 p.m. at Zuzu in Central Square in Cambridge (next to the Middle East). The show runs through August 24, but you'd make Eric very happy if you showed up on opening night.

      That's right. Today is my roommate Frank's birthday. Liza and I got him fancy blue-and-white porcelain (or porcelain-ish) napkin holders and salt and pepper shakers from Pier One. You say you wouldn't like that for your birthday? Well, you don't know Frank. We even wrapped them in lovely Andy Warhol/Jackie O wrapping paper from Paper Source. Coolidge Corner. The perfect one-stop shop for all your roommate birthday needs. After the birthday shopping yesterday, Liza and I went to Anna's Taqueria with Dylan Babb (but without Suarez, who had to cancel at the last minute due to a hectic off-site shift at Borders). We then brought the food to Liza's roofdeck, where we washed it down with a few Coronas. Overcast skies won't stop our fun, dammit.   I haven't been in the mood for writing much lately, and besides, I've been a bit busy at work, putting together Standard Operating Procedures for the various things I do here. The entire department has to put together SOPs, to be compiled in a giant deparmental manual. I guess that's for when we all die in a fiery bus crash or are abducted by aliens and another team of people can just swoop right in and take over our jobs by just reading the manual.  No huge plans for the weekend yet. I'm going to put in some overtime at Borders on Saturday. I normally work 8-11:30 am, but I'll probably put in a full day there, since I have to do the monthly listening station change-out, which is tedious and a bit frustrating, but ultimately rewarding. I also plan on sleeping in on Sunday, which will be my first official day off from either job in two weeks. Yay. I'd also like to see a movie or two or three. I haven't been to the movie theater in way too long, and there's a whole heap of films that I'd love to see: "Before Sunset," "Coffee and Cigarettes," "The Clearing," "Supersize Me" and a few others I can't think of right now. And please don't ask me if I'm going to see "Fahrenheit 9-11," because -- my leftist tendencies aside -- I'm not really a Michael Moore fan. I realize that Bush is an incompetent president. I don't need Moore and his cheap tactics to prove it to me.   In addition to the music I bought last Saturday during "40 percent off employee appreciation weekend," I picked up some more stuff at Liza's Borders in Cambridge on Monday, squeezing more product out of the remaining hours of the sale. I was originally just going to buy Pierre-Laurent Aimard's new CD of Charles Ives' "Concord Sonata" (they were holding a copy for me there), but I obviously couldn't stop there, picking up Paolo Conte's  Reveries  (not bad, but not as good as his previous, self-titled album) and  Selling England By The Pound  by Genesis (a 1973 Peter Gabriel-era album I'm finally updating from vinyl -- one of my favorite prog albums, and a far cry from the Phil Collins-led "Invisible Touch" pap).

      As a part-time employee of  urlLink Borders,  I get 33 percent off all books and CDs, in addition to 20 percent off DVDs and 15 percent off magazines (full-time employees only get 25 percent off books and CDs, but they get a $30 gift certificate every month, the bastards). However, twice a year -- usually in July and November -- we get a "40 percent off" weekend, where books and CDs are, you guessed it, 40 percent off (DVDs and magazines stay the same). This past weekend was one of those very weekends, and as if the 1,200+ discs I already own aren't enough, I'm now eight discs richer.   In addition to the 40 percent discount, all Boston Borders employees received either a $45 gift certificate (for part-timers) or a $50 one (for full-timers), as thanks for last month's particularly good sales. I'm happy to say that I went nicely underbudget on my saturday spree, only spending about $56 of my own money (not counting the $45 gift certificate).   Whenever I'm able to go on sprees like this (which isn't often, unfortunately), I try to be as eclectic as possible in my purchasing choices, and I think I accomplished that this weekend. Here's what I got:   urlLink Marshall Crenshaw: Marshall Crenshaw  This 1982 self-titled debut album from one of rock's most underappreciated singer/songwriters is something I've been inexplicably avoiding for some time now, and a nicely remastered version (complete with bonus tracks) courtesy of Rhino Records fits nicely in my CD collection. The 80s are alive and well with some cheesy, somewhat dated production techniques (why in the world were we all so obsessed with "big drums" back then?), but the songs are what matter here. Any album that contains "Someday, Someway," "Cynical Girl" and excellent covers of "Rave On" and "Solder of Love" needs to be recognized. Power-pop at its best.    urlLink Uncle Tupelo: No Depression  My recent reading of the Wilco biography, "Learning How To Die," has got me more interested in Jeff Tweedy's salad days with this twangy midwestern band of misfits. "No Depression" is the band's debut, and is a lot louder and rowdier than I expected. Which is good. The opening "Graveyard Shift" contains some of the most infectious guitar riffs I've heard in a long time.    urlLink Peter Gabriel: Security  I've been a PG fan since the early eighties, after being introduced to his music by my former step-uncle. His first four albums are all masterpieces, in my opinion, and his later forays into world music sorta left me cold. "Security" is album number four (the first three were all simply titled "Peter Gabriel," oddly enough) and while it does show a slight shift into exotic rhythms, with songs like "Rhythm of the Heat" and "San Jacinto," Gabriel's neo-prog madman persona is still alive and well. Gabriel's entire catalog was the subject of a nice reissue program about two years ago, and this is the last of the first four albums that I've finally upgraded from vinyl.   urlLink Tony Williams Lifetime: Emergency!  I've decided to go back to my junior high school roots and revisit jazz fusion. My first taste of this particular type of music took place during an early drum lesson when one of my teachers broke out "Spectrum" by Billy Cobham and I promptly found out that 4/4 time signatures are not an absolute. Williams is a drummer I've heard a lot about, but never really heard anything from. This landmark fusion album consists of drums, organ and guitar and borrows heavily from Miles Davis' concept of turning jazz on its ear. Recommended for people who like their music loud and distorted but still swinging.    urlLink Chick Corea: Now He Sings, Now He Sobs  Corea has explored many different areas of jazz and jazz-fusion, but this 1968 album -- his first real "solo" album -- is bare-bones jazz improv at its finest. Some of the best jazz piano you'll ever hear.    urlLink Bach: St. Matthew Passion  Okay, here's where I start to get snooty. I'm not an expert on this piece, but I've heard that McCreesh's version is one of the best around. My experience with Bach's choral works doesn't extend much beyond "Mass in B-Minor" (unless you include the Hilliard Ensemble's gorgeous  urlLink "Morimur,"  which you should buy immediately), but "St. Matthew Passion" is a good place to resume my curiousity.   urlLink Wilbert Hazelzet: Bach  Hazelzet takes Bach's cello suites and plays them on the flute, along with some flute sonatas, making for a truly relaxing, beautiful disc. I took a three-hour nap Saturday afternoon after listening to this.    urlLink Vivaldi: Concerti per Archi  Vivaldi is sort of my classical guilty pleasure. I like a lot of modern, dissonant classical works, in addition to some of the old "greats" like Bach and Beethoven, and Vivaldi's music tends to all sound the same, but if you're in the mood for some relatively harmless classical music, Vivaldi always fits the bill. This particular recording received a highly favorable review in the latest issue of Gramaphone magazine, and they always seem to know what they're talking about.

      Apparently, one of the contributing factors of John Edwards' appeal is his looks. Maybe it's just because I'm a straight guy, but I don't see it. I mean, he's not butt ugly or anything, but...handsome?   Let's take a poll. I would like all of the straight females (and gay men, while we're at it) to comment. Is John Edwards attractive?   Please do not let your political leanings influence your answer.

      Hi! Remember me? Are some of you still getting a big hunk of blank space at the top of my blog which requires you to scroll down  ad infinitum  until you get to the text? If so, I wish I could help you. I don't know why that's happening, but it doesn't seem to happen to me. Chalk it up to my amateurish web skills. How about people who use  ad infinitum  in regular conversation? Do you get a lot of that? Don't you just hate it?  So how was your Fourth? Liza and I spent the afternoon picnicking (or is it "picnicing?" whatever...) at the Arboretum in Jamaica Plain. One of Liza's Emerson classmates, the perpetually cool Dylan Babb, suggested the idea, and we went with her and her friend Kristen (or is it Krista? I forget). I had never been to the Arboretum before and I intend to go again many times in the future. What a beautiful place. I was so relaxed that I dozed off on the picnic blanket for a little while, which hopefully wasn't considered too offensive by my picnic-mates.   Liza, Suarez and I hung out on Liza's roofdeck that night with some Mexican snacks and  cerveza mas fina , hoping to catch a glimpse of the fireworks, and while we saw some impressive amateur neighborhood ones, we decided to head out by the Fleet Center to see the real ones. Good stuff.   Last week I put a couple of new reviews up on  urlLink delicious media,  including a review of the new Tragically Hip album from regular DM contributor and all-around nice guy Tom Johnson, in addition to my own review of "Learning How To Die," the extremely readable new Wilco biography. I've started to write a review of  Dog , the long-awaited new  urlLink Mike Keneally  album, but I have many complex issues to cover, all of them good, and I want to do it right. The bottom line is that it's a wonderful album -- no surprises there -- and you should buy it immediately. It won't be available in retail stores until probably the fall, but in the meantime you can order it on Mike's site, either in the standard edition, or an autographed, numbered "deluxe edition" which features a DVD with concert, studio and rehearsal footage that simply rocks the hizzouse. Guess which one I bought. Favorite songs so far include the fiery "Louie," the groovin' "Splane," the moody "Bober" and the utterly inexplicable 15-minute mindfuck known as "This Tastes Like a Hotel." Me likes.   It's been at least a week since I extolled the virtues of  urlLink Netflix,  so here we go again. I'm almost finished with season four of The Sopranos, and as usual, it's not disappointing me. This seems to be a pivotal season, what with the family's increasing distrust of Paulie, the truckload of issues surrounding Ralph, Christopher's drug problems, Pie-Oh-My, Furio's lust for Carmela, the return of Svetlana, blah blah blah. If you've been avoiding this show because of the overabundance of hype surrounding it, do yourself a favor and check it out. This is television at its finest, with incredible performances, first-rate writing, and the best, most eclectic selection of music I've ever heard for a TV show.   I also watched  urlLink "One Day in September"  a few days ago. It's a documentary about a group of Palestinian terrorists who took a group of Isreali athletes hostage during the 1972 Munich Olympics. Very informative and well-made. There was one scene near the end of the film where a montage of still photos of the aftermath is set to a very creepy, falsetto-laden Deep Purple song ("Child in Time"), to an extremely chilling effect. Roger Ebert complained about that scene in his review (calling it "tasteless"), but I think it worked very well.   Okay, that's it for now. Oh, and the new  urlLink Wilco  album is very good, but like the new Keneally, I need to let it seep more deeply into my consciousness before I can write anything worthy.

         All I want is four decent seats, guys.   Liza and I were supposed to head out to  White Trash Weekend V  tonight, but our transportation plans fell through at the last minute. Just as well, I think. I'm not really in the mood for a five-hour trek to Northern Maine and back in the span of 48 hours.   However, I've decided to still take tomorrow morning off from Borders, giving me my first true complete "weekend off" in God knows how long. Besides, our store's HR manager, Alex (a.k.a. "The Penguin") was so gratingly smug and "faux difficult" at the fact that I asked for the day off with very little advance notice ("oh, so you want the day off? Well...this is kind of short notice, wouldn't you say? Hmmm?"). Listen, assface, I could have just called in sick if it weren't for my damn "work ethic." Anyway, I decided to just keep that weekend off, and besides, I told Alex I'd work a full Sunday closing shift next weekend (time and a half! WHOO!).    So, a whole weekend with no plans. Well, I *do* have plans, actually. Liza and I are going to Target so that I can buy a big stack of wooden hangers to replace the various wire ones I've had since the Reagan administration. Wooden hangers rock! Thank you,  urlLink Carson!   Oh yeah...and another plan for the weekend is to get my ass online Saturday morning at 10 o'clock sharp in order to score  urlLink Wilco  tickets for me, Liza, Suarez and an as-yet-to-be-determined fourth party. Jeff Tweedy and his band of misfits I love so much will be at the Wang Center October 1st and Suarez and I both tried to score tickets Tuesday morning for the Wilco website-exclusive pre-sale, but those sold out in about.003 seconds. The general online sale starts tomorrow morning and you know where I'll be...hunched over Liza's infamous iBook with a cup of coffee and wearing my Wilco t-shirt for good luck. Wow. I need a life.

      Today is a good day for  urlLink Elvis Costello  fans. Rhino is continuing their stellar reissue program of Elvis' catalog with the release of new, double-disc special editions of  Almost Blue,   Goodbye Cruel World  and  Kojak Variety .   I realize that these are hardly the three best albums in the EC catalog, but they all have something to offer. Rhino has been reissuing Elvis' albums three-at-a-time, roughly every nine months, since around 2001. While the Rykodisc reissues (from the mid-nineties) certainly offered a lot in terms of bonus tracks and liner notes, Rhino has gone the extra mile by including an extra  disc  of nothing but bonus material in each reissue. Pretty convenient for a guy like me, who's been an Elvis fan going on 20 years,  and  who had his entire EC collection stolen a few years ago.    urlLink  Almost Blue   was the first album to throw Elvis fans for a loop. Released in 1981, it's a collection of country cover songs, not exactly punk rock, but pretty fitting for a guy who's always been a closet George Jones fan. You haven't lived until you hear Elvis' version of "Sweet Dreams." Oh, and the bonus disc is supposed to contain a duet with George Jones, singing Elvis' own "Stranger in the House."   urlLink  Goodbye Cruel World   is almost uniformly considered his worst album (by Elvis himself, among others), but my personal feelings about this much-maligned 1985 album are that the songs are mostly very good, but the production values stink to high heaven, all big drums and Yamaha DX-7 synthesizers. Some real gems (like "Worthless Thing," "Peace in Our Time" and "Home Truth") are on this album, you just have to wade through the big hair and John Hughes cheese.    urlLink  Kojak Variety   was a fun 1995 covers album with some excellent moments (particularly his soulful remake of the Louvin Brothers' "Must You Throw Dirt in My Face"). Not exactly groundbreaking, but a nice diversion.
