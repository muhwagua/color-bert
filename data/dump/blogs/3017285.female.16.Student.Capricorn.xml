        Feeling:  hungry o_O  Listening to:  No Regrets - Robbie Willimas  Reading:   1/0  (v. cool webcomic) -----    I wanted to write more earlier, but we were lierally walking out the door. Anyway, AP Euro wasn't too bad. Had to miss out a few multiple choice in the end, because I ran out of time. But the DBQ and Essays were pretty easy. The DBQ was on The Pilgrimage of Grace, and the two essays I did were on comparing/contrasting 17th century absolute monarchs with 20th century dictators (cool question, that) and one abou To What Extent (oo, "to what extent" cue the ominous music) did Romanticism challenge Enlightenment views about human nature etc. Pretty easy.  Now I have to go downstairs and turn off the light, and then go to bed.  Oh yeah, I'm also working on a nice layout for the blog. That is, I have the idea, I still need to put it together.  Night night.

         Mood:  tired   Listening to:  We Are The Champions - Queen   Reading:  AP European History notes -----   New Blog. I guess on second thought Blogger isn't too bad. And wait 'till I've made a purdy layout for this blog, then it'll be really great ^_^ I'm also working on a new layout for my website, but no spoilers yet ^_^ ---- Anyway, today was a fun day. First I got to sleep for half an hour more, because I had an opticians appointment. Apparently my eyes are getting better, my perscription's gone down :) And then I took the AP German exam today, which I had totally forgotten about. Thank god they came to find me XD It was easy though, except my spelling was probably completely wonky, but no worries, eh? Worries about my AP Euro exam tomorow, though. So much information to keep in my head *hides under bed*  Alero's just arrived gotta go ^_^

        Feeling:  greek XD  Listening to:  Come on Home - Franz Ferdinand  Reading:  still nothing -----   Troy is a very cool movie. I don't actually have as much to complain about as I though. Except for the fact that, you know, Paris should die, and Menelaeus shouldn't, and that CASSANDRA WAS NOT EVEN IN THERE!!!  But damn, wasn't Achilles cool? Very cool. Extremely cool. So was Hector. Paris was just a little wimp who couldn't even get killed properly. It's weird, though, how they just sort of cut out 10 years and had the seige last about..oh 4 days, maybe? 5?  I've added Greek war Helmet to my list of cool hats I want. XD

        Feeling:  anticipation  Listening to:  a very loud cricket outside  Reading:  nothing (!!) -----   We're going to see Troy tomorow. Then I can start complaining about what's wrong with it.   Did you know Achilles was gay? I didn't know that. We just had this conversation: Dad: Of course we have to see this movie. Didn't you know I am a direct descendant of Achilles (my dad's half greek) Mom: Achilles was gay. Me: Really? How so? Mom: because he was. Me: I mean, how do you know. Mom: it says so in the story. In the movie he has a woman lover, but really it was a man.  I must read into this. 'tis my heritage after all. (the fact that I've run out of yaoi-y fanfiction to read has nothing to do with it...XD)

        Feeling:  mweh...pain. and cold -----   Damn, it's cold in the computer room!  Anyway, my knee still hurts.  I have a pass for the elevator, but I don't want to use it too much. I get claustrophobic in elevators. And the school one makes strange noises...I nearly panic every time it stops because there's a bit of a delay untill the doors open. :( Sorta pathetic, I guess, but that's just me. My knee is in leauge with the forces of evil.  The school computers are so slow. It takes them about 10 minutes to open the stupid Login-window. And they're all iMacs of course *grumble*  But, it's friday, finally, and I can sleeeeeeeeep tomorow  ^_^

      I have resolved to better my english conversation. I can write just fine (even better than some people i know, i dare say XD), but whenever I'm explaining something to someone (as, just now, with my knee problem and the GP) it all comes out as a lot of "like" and "ermm...uh". It's really embarassing, actually. So now I am resolving to get my conversation up to my writing standard ^_^

        Feeling:  pain  Listening to:  the radio  Reading:  Webcomics -----   Man, what did I *do*? All I did was kneel down to get my keys off the floor, and my knee did some weird twisty-cracky thing, and now it hurts like  hell  whenever I walk. I must have weak knees or something, it started hurting on the DofE exped. too. Not as bad as this though. Ow.  On the plus side, I found a cool new webcomic:  urlLink applegeeks  Check it out.

        Feeling:  annoyed  Listening to:  the radio. it's playiong stupid music. must change station  Reading:  english VOCABULARY >( ... and fanfiction ^_^ -----   Vocabulary is annoying. Especially when you have to write idio(ma)tic sentences. Particularly when you're trying to read yaoi Zelda fanfiction. XD Hee hee.  Aaaaanyway, excuse me, I must now look up what "plangent" means. *grumble*

Who on Earth shedules meetings from four to five, when school ends at ten past three?  Anyway, yeah....I've had that song stuck in my head all day. *sings* "And I guess that's why they call it the blues. Time on my hands, could be time spent with you...." XD

        Feeling:  mweh-ish  Listening to:  Hand In My Pocket - Alanis Morisette  Reading:  webomics ^_^ -----   Got a bit pissed off at Leah at lunch today. She and Chel and carry where talking about something completely uninteresting, so I get my book out and read. And then when I went to get a donut she  hid  it! You DO NOT hide my books from me!! I WORSHIP my books. I pay money for my books. Someone spent months, if not years writing those words. You dop not simply TAKE them from me just because I am not interested in your conversation. But NOOOOO, according to leah, you either converse or just sit there and be bored.   For a while she pretended she'd thrown it away, because she "doesn't  like  books" WTF??!! doesn't like books? these words are incomprehensible to me. She also once said that she doesn't like reading because books are so inconvenient to hold, that she doesn't mind reading on the internet. we all read  Fahrenheit 451  in 8th grade, we're reading  Brave new World  now..can these people not SEE what they're turning society into??  riight..over-reacting now.....*deep breaths*   ok, I'm a bit calmer now. I'm still pissed at leah, though. *sigh* If only I had more friends.... ................ ANYway, go join  urlLink this  forum. It's run by Nicole, an online friend of mine, and it currently only has two members, her and me. ^_^

        Feeling:  tired  Listening to:  th air conditioning noise (man, that thing is loud in the computer room)  Reading:  Jennifer Government -----   Mweh. Couldn"t sleep last night. Got about 5 hours of sleep in total. probably less.  We're doing a political project in WWW programming now. I couldn't think of a "political organisation" to support/not support offhand, so he's given me the Green party in Germany.  Ooooooh boy. Is thiiiis gonna be  fun . I'm oozing sarcasm here, can you tell?  I mean come on. As far as I'm aware german politics never does anything. It just stagnates. And talks about pensions, I guess.  Ah well, maybe i'll learn something. I should keep up with the politics of my home country mor anyway.

        Reading:  Jennifer Government (by Max Barry) -----    I took this IQ test thingie online, and this is the result I got: "Congratulations, Hellen! Your IQ score is 133   This number is the result of a formula based on how many questions you answered correctly on Tickle's Classic IQ test. Your IQ score is scientifically accurate; to read more about the science behind our IQ test, click here.   During the test, you answered four different types of questions — mathematical, visual-spatial, linguistic and logical. We analyzed how you did on each of those questions which reveals how your brain uniquely works.  We also compared your answers with others who have taken the test. According to the sorts of questions you got correct, we can tell your Intellectual Type is a Visionary Philosopher.  This means you are highly intelligent and have a powerful mix of skills and insight that can be applied in a variety of different ways. Like Plato, your exceptional math and verbal skills make you very adept at explaining things to others — and at anticipating and predicting patterns"  Pretty cool, huh? especially since I wanna be a teacher. ------- Anyway. We went to see Van Helsing yesterday. Pretty good movie, all in all. Except there were these american ladies behind us who were talking through the  entire  thing. I swear. The entire cinema is silent, someone just died, and the woman behind me goes: "oh, did she get killed? Grrrrr...  Today we wnt to the family-fun day thing at school. I got a little teddybear, whom I'm calling Fredrick William II (after F. W. the first, the Sergeant King, the one who had a thing for tall soldiers XD) And I got a little magic doohicky of mass destruction. You know, one of those twirly things...I can't remember what it's called XD  And I got two lollipops ^_^  And I strted doing the drawings for the new layout for this ^_^

      So the "Student Life Comitee" are thinking of introducing school uniforms, and send round a questionaire to the parents for input.  How can the  students  not know of there is a  student  life comittee?!?! And why do we not get input? Our parents get a questionaire, send one to us too! I mean, I know most of the students are imature, but we deserve an input!!! Or, better yet, representation! There's a proper job for the student council, represent the students in front of the Student Life Comittee. They can give questionaires to homeroom representatives, who'll get opinions from their homeroom and then get them back to the comitee. I can't believe that there is a Student Life Comittee. I can't believe they don't tell us that there's a Student Life Comittee. I shall complain to someone as soon as i find out who to complain to. Maybe I'll write an article about it for the school newspaper (*snort* and watch it be discarded in favour of some random piece of news about the golf team)

        Feeling:  content  Listening to:  Somebody To Love - Queen -----   I love it when the room smells this way. You know, when the sun's been shining all day and the air inside is sort of...moist, and warm, and it just  smells  like it's summer outside. I love it. In some weird unfathomable way it reminds me of Yoshi's Story on N64. Don't ask me why, it just does.  I just came back from the physiotherapist, and aparently I've been standing and walking the wrong way for..ever. Sheesh, knees, it's been 16 years, couldn't you have said something?! Oh wait, my knees can't talk... XD Or maybe getting inflamed is just their way of saying something. Anyway, I have to stop locking my knees when I stand. It feels all weird, like I'm going to fall over at any second because my knees are bent. I am now actually using muscles when I stand...'tis a n odd feeling.

I wanna have a best friend....  Damn it, now I'm all sad....
