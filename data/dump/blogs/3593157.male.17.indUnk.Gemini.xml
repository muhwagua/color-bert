And doesn't his daughter go there?   Then again, maybe Mr. Bush was just recruited by the university for his superb cheerleading skills:     But yeah, I agree with him. I hope he pursues that stance and wasn't just saying it to impress the minority reporters that he was addressing.

      The July employment numbers wre released today. Select your poison:   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,128209,00.html   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/business/06CND-ECON.html   urlLink http://www.iht.com/articles/532875.html   Looks like payroll growth was alarmingly weak this month.   Now I'm not saying that this is all Bush's fault but it looks like Bush's plan to create jobs by handing out tax cuts isn't faring so well. He still seems convinced so though:  "Because of my policy of strengthening the economy while enforcing spending discipline in Washington, we remain on pace to reduce the deficit by half in the next five years." ( urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,127678,00.html )  Hmm, I don't see how permanent tax cuts, insanely high spending, and weak job growth is going to reduce the deficit. I mean seriously, reducing your source of income and increasing spending do not go well together.  Seriously, economically-speaking, the Bush administration has been one of the most liberal administrations in recent history. They're almost too liberal for my taste!    Addendum:  By the way, Bush's quote was "We're turning a corner and we're not turning back".   Kind of similar to something another great President said not too long aog: "prosperity is just around the corner". That President was Herbert Hoover and he made that statement during the Great Depression. He was the last President in history to preside over a net job loss.

      Hey officer. Sorry I just fatally hit that old woman while speeding with my SUV. I was on my way to deliver this fresh batch of cookies to the post office. I'm sending them to the troops. I support the troops. What's that? You're arresting me? But officer! You can't arrest me, what about the troops? You INSIST that I step out of the car? That'a outrageous, officer! I'll bet you're French. If you're not French, I'll bet you've been to France. AND YOU LIKED IT THERE! Odds are you like Michael Moore as well (Michael Moore is a socialist pig!). I am reporting you to your supervisor for sympathizing with terrorists, officer. That's basically what you're doing. By not letting me get to the post office, you're depriving the troops of the goods they need to defeat terrorists and A-rabs. How could you?! I know the problem! You're a liberal, aren't you? The downfall of our country. You should be ashamed! Now let me pass, or the terrorists and gays have won! That's right officer. Just go back in your car and pretend this never happened. You  may have let someone that has broken the law go, but you're supporting the troops! God bless you, officer! I'll get these, uhm, cookies to the post office right away!

      That was our Commander in Chief, addressing a number of Pentagon officials earlier today, at a defense appropriations bill signing ceremony. Immature, yes, I know, but hey, maybe Bush is finally confessing to the Valerie Plame scandal!

      What has America come to when perverted religious teachings have infiltrated the state constitutions of the United States?  Recently, Missouri passed an amendment to their constitution banning gay marriage. In November a measure will be on the Oregon ballot attempting to ban gay marriage.  With 60% of Americans favoring a constitutional amendment this will be pass easily.  WHAT THE FUCK!  How could 60% of Americans favor limiting the rights of their fellow citizens.  What is wrong with gay marriage?  I'll tell you what Americans don't like about it: the bible condemns homosexuality.  People feel that they need to subject the rest of our country with their religious views.  The last time I checked the Constitution of the United States of America said that Church and State would not mix.  This has got to be the most blatant violation to our constitution I have ever seen.  We cannot allow a 2000 year old book dictate the way we live.  People have used the bible to protect slavery, and in the 60s some states banned interracial marriage citing the bible as their guiding light.  How foolish Americans will feel in 50 years when we look back at our homophobic actions.  Text books will describe how one president even tried to pass an amendment banning gay marriage.  As an American, I have learned that every person is born with certain inalienable rights, and that everyone should be able to exercise them.  And, today, Americans are trying to stop their fellow citizens from doing so.  "The objection to Puritans is not that they try to make us think as they do, but that they try to  make us do as they think."     -H.L. Mencken

      (click the title)    (as of August 5th)  That's a really interesting site that, instead of viewing polls in terms of the popular vote, breaks them state by state to display them in the way that matters: at the electoral college. According to their projects, Kerry is beating Bush by 70 votes in the electoral college. As you can see though, most of the states Bush has are states that he's holding on to very strongly. He's "strong" in all of them. I think whats going on is that, by adopting such a conservative agenda, Bush is bringing out lots of new voters. Problem is: he's bringing these votes out in the conservative strongholds. He's doing nothing but strengthening and solidifying his base, which can be a good thing for fundraising and campaigning but when it comes to the vote and when it comes to the electoral college, that won't help him. In this country, elections are decided by a select number of swing voters in a select number of states. Those voters don't really care about flip-flopping and all that other mud the Bush campaign is throwing Kerry's way. Unlike conservative voters, who might come out in droves if there are ammendments and initiatives banning same-sex marriage, Bush's increasingly rightist agenda doesn't appeal to them. But that issue still may be a factor since it'll bring out a number of extra conservatives voters who feel really passionately about the issue. Many people seem to neither oppose nor support gay marriage. They just don't care. They'd rather have it but they probably won't come out to the polls to ensure it happens. Many of those who are against it are pretty vehemently against it and WILL come out to vote. That means more votes for Bush.   Or maybe I'm just stereotyping and have no idea what I'm talking about. If that's the case, I'll just shut up and direct everyone at this  urlLink state-by-state breakdown of a much more important issue .

      Look at the sucka Republicans put up to try and bring down Democratic rising-star/juggernaut/heartthrob Barack Obama:    Hmm, I wonder why they picked this man. HMMM.   He ain't winnin' nuthin'. I pity the foo who tries to bring down the Obaminator! The last two suckas who tried got owned.   But seriously, I've heard some pretty impressive stuff about Alan Keyes. Apparantly, he's a master debater (lol) so that ought to be interesting. He's also supposed to be a master election-loser and I hope he decides to utilize that skill in losing his race with Obama. At least this shows that the RNC recognizes the threat Obama will pose to them in the future and has dispatched a somewhat formidable opponent to match him. Now I just hope Obama doesn't dissapoint this early in his career.

      This post will hopefully be a continuation of Sean's post on the other blog.   Sean Major posted this intellectually stimulating and artistically genius comic that he himself drew:   Mr. Major explained his masterpiece by explaining how he had pictured the US as "a slave to foreign oil some say". He understood that the US would always need to import some oil but reasoned that the American "economy doesn't have to be their bitch". He went on to explain how the dependence was not just economic and stipulated that the "dependence has caused just about every brouhaha over there in the Middle East". As a possible alternative, he pointed at oil reserves in "our own backyard" but noted that this sort of an observation wouldn't sit well with "Cheney the Oil Pimp", due to the fact that Mr. Cheney would need "to stack his cheese".   The discussion took off from there. Ryan Moran engaged Mr. Major in tempered political discourse, addressing him as "Sean, you liberal piece of crap" and demanding more clarification about "what kind of fucking alternatives to foreign oil" existed. He then correlated Sean's lack of clarity with the trouble the Democratic party is often cited as having in truly understanding "the issue before making a stand". Mr. Moran continued his scathing indictment with the hope that Mr. Major would be able to wrap "fat head around" the broader complexities of the issue.   At this point, Gus Jewell stepped in noted his agreement with Mr. Major's arguments, not that he had a "good point". He explained that while he agreed the Saudi royal family should not "the American people for profits", he went on to state his dissaproval for Mr. Major and Mr. Moran's suggestion of using "depleting limited oil reserves in Alaska", especially considering the fact that said reserves "only contain enough oil to sustain the United States for 6 months". He then offered other alternative energy proposals, including but not limited to hydrogen power and hybrid cars.   Mr. Jewell also made note of Mr. Major's obvious skill in drawing penises which lead Mr. Major to promptly explain that they are "pretty easy to draw once you get the hang of it". He also doubted Mr. Jewell's "6 months" claim, suggesting that more reserach and investment would yield more positive information.   Mr. Jewell then argued that domestic wildlife reserves should be preserved for as long as is possible, suggesting that we first exhaust Middle Eastern oil sources and than consider alternative fuel sources before choosing to endanger the environment. Domestic oil, he explained, would hardly solve the problem and soon the nation would once again find itself depending on foregin oil if domestic sources were exhausted. H  At this point, Shakeer Rahman joined the discussion and began by pointlessly declaring that he had "missed out on all the action". He then made a candid note of his distress over the fact that the first thing people were considering when brainstorming over "alternative fuel sources" were drilling oil in different places. Instead he suggested that the focus be shifted to true alternative sources such as "wind, solar, biomass, hydrogen cells, whatever". He agreed with Mr. Major and Mr. Jewell's argument that the nation was becoming too dependant on foreign oil and in particular, the Saudi Royal family. He backed up this claim with a few statistics about the extent of the Saudi Royal family's investment in the United States but the validity of these statistics has yet to be confirmed.   Mr. Rahman then shifted the focus of the discussion to oil refineries and explained that refineries were where oil usually got bottlenecked and blamed rising oil prices on refineries, making note of the fact that OPEC oil production was at a 25-year high. He even made note of the fact that "the Saudis have offered to build refineries" in the United States. No one has yet been able to figure out why he felt it neccesary to make note of this fact. He then made the more relevant observation that the royal family "offered to lower the price of oil around election season to help Bush win", promptly adding "I'm not even joking".   Afterwards, Mr. Rahman attempted to discredit all his arguments by noting that he was "more distressed about the power that energy companies have" than he was about "the power that foreign nations have". His arguments, designed to charge up the debate, ending up doing nothing but boring everybody. The post stood still for a few days before Mr. Rahman decided to post one more time. This time, he made note of Mr. Dick Cheney's recent allegations that Democractic Presendential hopefuls John Kerry and John Edwards were to blame for rising oil prices.   He continued with the following quip: "apparantly at a time when the Republican party controls the White House, both Houses of Congress, and have greater ties to oil companies than any other administration in recent history, it's two Democrats that are to blame for hindering their plans". One would imagine that Mr. Rahman took great pleasure in this joke of his. This has yet to be confirmed.     Let's try and continue this debate in the Comments section of this post.

      http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/03/opinion/03krug.html (you need to be registered on nytimes in order ot see that. it's free.)  The following is a very interesting article that, as the titles obviously implies, disseminates the widely-held and long-standing belief that the American media has some kind of huge Leftist slant. It's by Paul Krugman, an economist and writer for the New York Times.   Reading the Script  By PAUL KRUGMAN, August 3, 2004  A message to my fellow journalists: check out media watch sites like campaigndesk.org, mediamatters.org and dailyhowler.com. It's good to see ourselves as others see us. I've been finding The Daily Howler's concept of a media "script," a story line that shapes coverage, often in the teeth of the evidence, particularly helpful in understanding cable news.   For example, last summer, when growth briefly broke into a gallop, cable news decided that the economy was booming. The gallop soon slowed to a trot, and then to a walk. But judging from the mail I recently got after writing about the slowing economy, the script never changed; many readers angrily insisted that my numbers disagreed with everything they had seen on TV.   If you really want to see cable news scripts in action, look at the coverage of the Democratic convention.   Commercial broadcast TV covered only one hour a night. We'll see whether the Republicans get equal treatment. C-Span, on the other hand, provided comprehensive, commentary-free coverage. But many people watched the convention on cable news channels - and what they saw was shaped by a script portraying Democrats as angry Bush-haters who disdain the military.   If that sounds like a script written by the Republicans, it is. As the movie "Outfoxed" makes clear, Fox News is for all practical purposes a G.O.P. propaganda agency. A now-famous poll showed that Fox viewers were more likely than those who get their news elsewhere to believe that evidence of Saddam-Qaeda links has been found, that W.M.D. had been located and that most of the world supported the Iraq war.   CNN used to be different, but Campaign Desk, which is run by The Columbia Journalism Review, concluded after reviewing convention coverage that CNN "has stooped to slavish imitation of Fox's most dubious ploys and policies." Seconds after John Kerry's speech, CNN gave Ed Gillespie, the Republican Party's chairman, the opportunity to bash the candidate. Will Terry McAuliffe be given the same opportunity right after President Bush speaks?   Commentators worked hard to spin scenes that didn't fit the script. Some simply saw what they wanted to see. On Fox, Michael Barone asserted that conventioneers cheered when Mr. Kerry criticized President Bush but were silent when he called for military strength. Check out the video clips at Media Matters; there was tumultuous cheering when Mr. Kerry talked about a strong America.   Another technique, pervasive on both Fox and CNN, was to echo Republican claims of an "extreme makeover" - the assertion that what viewers were seeing wasn't the true face of the party. (Apparently all those admirals, generals and decorated veterans were ringers.)   It will probably be easier to make a comparable case in New York, where the Republicans are expected to feature an array of moderate, pro-choice speakers and keep Rick Santorum and Tom DeLay under wraps. But in Boston, it took creativity to portray the delegates as being out of the mainstream. For example, Bill Schneider at CNN claimed that according to a New York Times/CBS News poll, 75 percent of the delegates favor "abortion on demand" - which exaggerated the poll's real finding, which is that 75 percent opposed stricter limits than we now have.   But the real power of a script is the way it can retroactively change the story about what happened.   On Thursday night, Mr. Kerry's speech was a palpable hit. A focus group organized by Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, found it impressive and persuasive. Even pro-Bush commentators conceded, at first, that it had gone over well.   But a terrorism alert is already blotting out memories of last week. Although there is now a long history of alerts with remarkably convenient political timing, and Tom Ridge politicized the announcement by using the occasion to praise "the president's leadership in the war against terror," this one may be based on real information. Regardless, it gives the usual suspects a breathing space; once calm returns, don't be surprised if some of those same commentators begin describing the ineffective speech they expected (and hoped) to see, not the one they actually saw.   Luckily, in this age of the Internet it's possible to bypass the filter. At c-span.org, you can find transcripts and videos of all the speeches. I'd urge everyone to watch Mr. Kerry and others for yourself, and make your own judgment.    Oh and hello and welcome to the new blog.

      Hi my name is Shakeer. Recognizing the need to shift divisive political content away from my own beloved blog, me, and a few other veterans of my blog, have decided to establish a politics-dedicated blog of our own. I've had this idea for quite a while (in fact, I first made urlLink  misunderestimated.blogspot.com  in November of 2000) but just never felt that anybody really cared or was interested in what people like me had to say about politics and current events (very much unlike how EVERYONE just loves and adores what I have to say on my blog about myself). Recent political posts on the other blog have indicated otherwise. Consequently, I decided to revitalise this old blog. I'm hoping that this blog will ofer not only a channel for us to share information on issues we feel very passionately about but will also become a forum for discussion and sensible debate. In order for the latter to work though, we need your help. We've just begun and in order for this to be succesful, we need people such as yourself to post comments and join in. So please do. Please leave comments and discuss with us. Make sure to tell us who you are when leaving comments though. We wouldn't want to find ourselves debating paper tigers (Gus tends to do that alot). Whatever a paper tiger is.   Also, if you're interested in writing here, please shoot me an email (my address is shakeer(at)gmail.com) or just find and speak to me. Thanks!  And enjoy.

      I am officially resigning from blogging. This has nothing to do with the local politics of this particular blog, I am just sick and tired of the way our country is run, and because of this, I am going to Canada. I am hoping to accomplish several goals: 1. Avoid the draft at all costs (You know its coming) 2. Cheap drugs (probably mostly manufactured in asia) 3. Get the hell out of this country before it gets driven into the ground by our nut-job president. Ok, now for the serious part- I am going to canada for a week for vacation and, as irrelevant as it seems now, I thought it'd be a good idea to record my observations of the observations of the Canadians concerning current American politics. I will watch all sorts of Canadian news, and maybe even talk to some Canadians (I am bringing a video camera, maybe I'll make a  moore wellian documentary or something). So up to now I haven't said much that actually has a place on this blog; but here's the pitch... instead of posting multiple entries concerning whatever I see and hear up there, I will instead continue to post as comments on this entry, thus keeping it all in one place. So if you feel inclined to check up on this over the next week, I hope to have insightful comments about what the Canucks think of us yankees. Stay tuned.

      The following are screenshots I just took of the official websites for the Democractic (dnc.org) and Republican (rnc.org) parties.     urlLink     urlLink     The RNC website has no less than 4 images of Kerry's face plastered across its front page. In fact, those are the only images you see on the top section of the page, aside from all the flags. It seems like the entire focus of that top section of the site is John Kerry, John Kerry's voting record, which bills John Kerry didn't vote for, John Kerry's position on Iraq, and how John Kerry is a "Massachusetts liberal out of touch with America". They even link to FOX news stories, which I guess they just did to add character. Or credibility. I can't figure out which.   The DNC website on the other hand has 1 picture of Kerry on their page. The website has links to ways to contribute to the Kerry campaign, ways to volunteer, and bios of Kerry and Edwards. To the right, it has a link to a thing that "exposes" Bush's record in your state.   Other then that, there a few occurances of the word "Bush" further down the page. I counted four total. This is quite different from the 13 text occurances of the word "Kerry" on the RNC site. That doesn't count mentions in images.  Maybe it's just because my job involves web design and so I have have experienced first-hand how websites are used to achieve marketing goals and how effective a communication tool they can be. That may explain why I'm making such a big deal out of this. But still, I just get sick of always hearing that the Democratic party is the one that's focusing too much on its criticizing its opposition and not enough on defining its own image and platform. Their websites seem to indicate otherwise.

      Ugh.  "Strict regulations published by Athens 2004 last week dictate that spectators may be refused admission to events if they are carrying food or drinks made by companies that did not see fit to sponsor the games. Sweltering sports fans who seek refuge from the soaring temperatures with a soft drink other than one made by Coca-Cola will be told to leave the banned refreshment at the gates or be shut out. High on the list of blacklisted beverages is Pepsi, but even the wrong bottle of water could land spectators in trouble."   "Staff will also be on the lookout for T-shirts, hats and bags displaying the unwelcome logos of non-sponsors. Stewards have been trained to detect people who may be wearing merchandise from the sponsors' rivals in the hope of catching the eyes of television audiences. Those arousing suspicion will be required to wear their T-shirts inside out."

      The article is nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary but I found it to be very well-written and interesting nonetheless. Not to mention somewhat entertaining. Also it sums up the current political and social climate pretty well, albeit from a biased perspective.   Also it's on Esquire.com so if you get bored or disgruntled, there are plenty of photographs of barely clothed women on the site that you can resort to inspecting.

      After the Bush campaign demanded an answer from Kerry about his vote for war in Iraq, he responded that he would, but "would have done this very differently than President Bush has."  He continued by asking a few questions of Bush, according to CNN.com: "My question to President Bush is why did he rush to war without a plan to win the peace?" Kerry asked. "Why did he rush      to war on faulty intelligence and not do the hard work necessary to give America the truth?  Why did he mislead America about how he would go to war? Why has he not brought other countries to the table in order to support American troops in the way that we deserve it and relieve a pressure from the American people?" Well I have a few questions for Kerry as well.  Why did Kerry give Bush war powers without hearing a plan to return sovereignty to Iraq and restore the country?  Why did Kerry (as well as other Senators simply accept the intelegence they were handed, especially in light of the September 11 intelligence failures?  Finally, why did he approve a plan that was bound to cause an uproar in the Middle East and was largely criticized by many countries and US allies?    While I'd like to hear Bush answer the questions directed at him, it would be interesting to hear Kerry respond to a few of mine.

      Today Alan Keyes succesfully seized 13% of total posts on the Misunderestimated blog newswire and effectively established himself as the most posted-about topic. The shift came after Misunderestimed chief editor Shakeer Rahman decided to post a third topic on the twice-unsuccesful candidate for President and Senator of Maryland, his home state. The post came after Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert released his endorsement Mr. Keyes, as  urlLink related by  the  Times :   "I spent five weeks trying to find good people," said Mr. Hastert, who said he approached state legislators and the former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and Gary Fencik, an Ivy Leaguer who was a hard-hitting safety.  "I got down into last week interviewing a 70-year-old guy who was a great farm broadcaster in Illinois," Mr. Hastert said. "He decided because of his health problems he couldn't do it. You know, we were down — we needed to find somebody to run, somebody who wanted to run. And, you know, Alan Keyes wants to run, and I hope he's a good candidate." I'm glad his own party feels so passionately about his candidacy. Of course, I don't blame them, judging by Mr. Keyes' own foolishness and hypocracy, as typified by  urlLink this statement  he made four years ago about Hilary Clinton running for Senatorial office in a state she'd never resided in:  "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness to go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there. So I certainly wouldn't imitate it." Of course, the Illinois Republican party had a statement ready to counterbalance this argument. According to a Republican party official in Illinois (sorry, I don't have a precise quote, I heard it on the radio), the reason that Mr. Keyes had changed his mind was that of all things,  9/11  had changed everything and that considering the current political climate, such a decision was acceptable. 9/11, yeah, that makes sense. Especially considering that one of the deciding factors for Keyes was Obama's stance on  urlLink abortion issues . Yeah, we all know how 9/11 changed the way people view the issue of abortion.   On the other hand, Mr. Keyes did have some other personal convictions in choosing to run against Obama:  "I'll tell you by the time I got through the records, I was convinced that somebody had to run against Barack Obama."  "I must leave the land of my forefathers [i.e., Maryland] in order to defend the land of my spirit, of my conscience and my heart -- and I believe that that land is Illinois."   Uhh yeah, that makes sense. Not really congruent with his earlier statement that he was running despite " urlLink a strong personal resistance ". But yeah Mr. Keyes, whatever you say!

      Fox News is officially my news station of choice. Why? Of course, their obvious conservative filtering and Republican spinning of the propaganda they consider news appeals to my desire to be lied to. Hah! Yeah Right! I actually do enjoy watching the O'Reiley Factor, but comparatively there are few hot women on his show. Yes, I said it. I love watching Fox news because it has the hottest newscasters in the world. Seriously check it out, they're babes.

      I am honored to add my first post to this amzing blog full of insight and talent. I am also pleased to announce the beggining of a new dimension of blogging (if it works). I will bring to the table extensive knowledge of the American political system, my credentials surpassed only by my savvy. I have recently met with some of the key players in our government as well as prominent figures in the American political scene to discuss the status and ramifications of current policy and politics. Names such as Sen. Chuck Hagel, Terry McAuliffe (DNC chairman), Dennis Van Roekel (VP of the NEA), Ron Nessen (Ford's press secretary), Paul V. Kelly (Assistant Sec. of State), Rep. Darlene Hooley (Majority of us are in her district), and Gov. Ted Kulongowski. Yes, some I heard speak, others met personally, one I introduced to a group before a speech. So, while I have stories to tell about them, they aren't even the top sources from who I have gained political knowledge and expertise (though the most famous). Anyway, I am liberal- but I play devil's advocate very well, if only for the sake of argument. So with that, I feel I have much to add in the coming election year and beyond. I am called to report my opinions and ideas to this blog, not for my own ego, (though that laundry list of politicans was kinda egotistical) but rather because it is my duty. My duty to the blogging community, to ignorant Democrats and fire-breathing Republicans, and to America at large. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I announce; this is Jack Arriaga "Reporting... for duty" (I also enjoy puns, sarcasm, and irony in my writing)

      This is an official press release: This actually has never happened before, but we are going to invite Jimmy on to the blogging team after only a couple of comments.  I'm sorry to those of you who have waited your whole lives to write for Misunderestimated, but Jimmy has shown promise and he will bring his sarcastic-conservative-liberal views to the table.  May the blog be with you.
