      Take a look at this article...   urlLink Video Store Seeks OK to Censor   I don't know why all these directors are getting so het up about.  If the video store wants to edit films to cater for those who find sex, violence and strong language offensive, why shouldn't they?  The terrestrial TV companies [e.g.  urlLink  The BBC ]edit films all the time...  [although, not so much as they used to in the old days, but I can never watch a decent version of SPEED on BBC1 LOL]

      MOVIE CATCH UP  Been playing movie catch up since I've been off ill.  I watched  urlLink 15 Minutes  yesterday.  It was really good until towards the end, where it just go plain ridiculous.  It turned into a comedy show...  Fancy dying then pretending to film your dying moments and then actually dying afterwards.  Too ridiculous.  I liked the DVD extras.   They sure packed a lot in.  I especially liked seeing the likes of Jerry Springer, Sally Jesse Raphael and Maury Povitch justifying the antics of 'tabloid news' programmes.  We just don't have that over here.  Maybe we're just not sophisticated enough.  Another film I watched was  urlLink Almost Famous .  Now that was a great movie and I didn't realise it was based on Cameron Crowe's life experiences as a young writer for Rolling Stone.  Boy, he's fitted in a lot in his young life.  Kudos dude...:D  Great performances by all involved.  I especially loved Franc[strike]i[/strike]es McDormand as the overbearing mother.     urlLink Billy Crudup  is a babe.  He looks just like  urlLink Johnny Depp .  They were separated at birth...LOL  Great stuff!

Speaking of cars, I just got mine back today [thank goodness, I missed you!!]. I was having to drive that jankey, broke-down hire care all of last week.  Now, I have to get used to driving it again....it felt weird when I sat in it to reverse it into my drive.

      I had a car accident on Tuesday. The guy in front of me came to a dead stop and I put the brakes on, but then my foot slipped off and I thought 'Oh no, I'm gonna hit him' and I did...  BOGUS!  And, I tried to swerve out of the way, but still got the corner of his car. I went into another lane and caused another car to brake suddenly and the truck behind him went into him, so, 2 accidents for the price of 1....   To add to that, the truck and I were on the side of the road when another car came along, didn't see the truck in time, put his brakes on and had another truck go into the back of him.  So, not a good day for me yesterday. I went home with a headache and took the day off.....  Cause of the accidents. People driving too fast in poor, rainy conditions with slippery feet on crappy peddals.  To think, the car I was driving was a courtesy car because my car was in the shop getting repaired. So, new car, not used to driving it also didn't help my situation....

      We're in the middle of an 8 day firefighters strike.  I just got home to find that the brick shed at the end of my road has been set alight by children.  How can people be so malicious, especially children, I don't know.  The shed is near the row of houses that contains my house.  I've reported it.  The lady said "Don't you know the firemen are striking".  Yeah, I know...  "I'll report it, but I dunno if they'll come..."  Why pick up the phone please...?

       WINTER WONDERLAND   Went to work this morning.  It was a bit nippy to say the least.  When I left at 4pm and I was in the middle of a snow blizzard!  As I walked toward my car it was like I was walking on cotton wool, the ground was so white and soft [I love the feeling fresh snow underfoot].  My car was covered in a thick blanket of snow as was everywhere about ~ it was lovely.  I wanted to caputure the moment on my digital camera, but when I got it out, the battery was dead.  I thought to myself 'Oh well, it'll be the same where I live, so I'll wait til I get home to take the picture, no worries..'.  I got home and there was no snow to be seen, it was just wet everywhere.  The snow hadn't settled.  I was so gutted.    Isn't it wild how the weather can change over such a short distance.  I was only about 10 mins away from home, yet no snow anywhere..:(  Mind you it took me 40 mins to get home as you had to be careful driving about.  I saw a nice Merc left for the dead on the side of the road, having smashed into the back of another car [such a shame...LOL].

       urlLink This-or-That     1. Super Bowl or World Series?  Not fair, I'm from England, dunno the difference.  Ok, I think I know.  Superbowl=football, World Series=baseball.  If I'm right then Superbowl babee.  2. Winter or summer?   Summer coz I hate being cold.  3. Look up numbers in the phone book, or call directory assistance?   Call 192, so much easier.  4. Mashed potatoes or French fries?  French Fries.  I know they're fattening, but they're just yummy  5. Hand-code your website, or use an editor (such as Front Page)?   I'm a lazy cow I need Frontpage...LOL  6. Freeway or winding country road?   Get me on the Freeway/Motorway babee.  I still have to find out about my speeding fine...  7. Star Wars or Star Trek?  The first 3 [Star Wars/Empire Strike Back/Return of the Jedi] are *awesome*.  This new stuff is a load of rubbish.  8. Disney or Warner Brothers cartoons?   Disney I guess.  Can't really beat that old chestnut.  9. When it feels chilly in the house: crank up the heat or put on a sweater?   Crank up the heat.  10. CBS or PBS?   Another 'not fair one' coz I'm in England!!  I'll pass.

      I cannot abide bad customer service....  I ran to Rymans as I needed to get something.  I got to the door at 5.25pm.  It was locked.  The shop is meant to close at 5.30.  I called the manager over and pointed this out to him.  He said he's already cashed his till up so couldn't serve me.  I knew exactly what I wanted.  I wasn't a browser, but he wouldn't let me in.  He just walked away from me.  I called him over again and  asked for his Head Office telephone number in order to make a complaint and he wouldn't come.  Then I shouted through the slit in the door and he eventually came back over and gave me a slip of paper with the number on.  Damn - If I had done that in my job [I work for a bank], I'd have been slaughtered by my HO.  How do people get away with this?  Definately a person who wants slapping.    grrrrrrrr

I did get an apology, but it's just words.  It will take a little while for me to trust them again.  And...  Hubby has just gone and broken 3 of my best cups [one's that I collect and don't use], my glass measuring jug and other glasses.  Why are men so damn clumsy!!

      It's been snowing for the last 2 days now.  I love the snow when it's first laid down as a blanket on the earth.    I hate it when it's all sludgey and dirty.  It's cool to have snow.  We've not been getting a lot of it over here these days.  The  urlLink climate has definately changed  over the years.  Here's a pic of my back yard.

      Hubby says I was giggling in my sleep last nite.  What I was giggling about is beyond me.  I must've been having a good dream.   [It's a shame I don't remember them...]   Then he tells me it's not the first time I've acted strange in my sleep.  Last week I was talking out loud and said his name, but he didn't stay awake long enough to find out what I wanted.   [Thanx goodness I didn't say someone else's name ~ know what I mean...LOL].   I do remember another incident.  We'd only been married 6 months and had moved to a new flat coz the flat we were living in before had mice and I just couldn't wait to get out of the place  [It's was an old victorian house we were living in and the guy downstairs was a bit, ya know...unclean].   The mice thing was still playing on my mind and I distinctly remember talking to my hubby and asking him to make sure the cupboards were clean and that everything was sealed so that the mice didn't get in.  I remember getting really frustrated and yelled at him because he wasn't understanding my instructions.  No wonder he couldn't understand me, I was asleep at the time...

      I just love  urlLink THE TOPICS BLOG     How long do you take in the shower? If you take a long time, is all of that time really necessary?    I take as little time as possible in the shower, even when I'm on holiday.  I don't see the point of taking long showers.  You just come out all wrinkly anyways.  Hubby on the otherhand take long with everything, baths, showers, eating.  Drives me crazy, especially when we're supposed to be going out somewhere.  He always makes us late.  We're complete opposites, but I love him dearly...

       1. Morning or night person?  I'm a night person. Example.  Went to bed at 3am last nite...  2. Heavy or light sleeper?  unfortunately, light.  Made even worse by a hubby who snores....  3. Remember your dreams or not?   Don't remember 'em, even if I do have 'em.  4. Do you need a lot of sleep, or just a little?  I should say I need a lot of sleep, but I frequently get away with a little [4-6 hrs] and am still able to function as a normal member of society.  5. Do you need something like a nightlight or TV to sleep, or do you prefer complete darkness?  It's gotta be dark and it's gotta be SILENT!  Any noise and I can't get to sleep at all.  It takes me ages.  That's prolly why I stay up so much.  6. Flannel sheets or some other kind?  Flannels are nice, but I have normal cotton and posh lace.  7. One pillow, or more?  One pillow, although, I don't always use it.  When I was younger I never used a pillow at all.  8. Bedroom door opened or closed at night?  Has to be shut to keep the noises out [and in too......LOL]  9. Wrap yourself into blankets like a cocoon, or just cover yourself with them?  I hog the covers and wrap myself up like a KFC twister.  10. Alarm clock: wake to music or buzzer?   Gotta have the radio.  Capital FM and the dulcet tones of Mr Chris Tarrant.

I guess I'm a closet Leo fan coz I have a heck of a lot of his movies in my cupboard.  He's an excellent actor and I like the fact that he could pull off playing a 16 year old fresh faced kid and also a very mature 18 year old [after being shut up in prison]. And just capturing the bare face cheekiness of Frank Abagnale.  Brilliant!   This is my favourite bit of the movie...

       MICHAEL JACKSON ~ THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES...              Skin grafts, multiple nose jobs and facial liposuction are some of the surgeries that three respected plastic surgeons speculate   MICHAEL JACKSON   may have undergone over the past 20 years. One issue the doctors are all concerned about is the King of Pop's nose.  DR. THOMAS LOEB  theorizes, &quot;... he lost the skin on top of the nose and he's ulcerated through. They had to do some kind of reconstructive procedure to just cover the cartilage underneath. So this is really a plastic surgery disaster.&quot;  DR. ROBERT KOTLER  points out, &quot;There's a limit to how much surgery you can perform and he may have passed that limit.&quot;            I've just finished watching  urlLink Living With Michael Jackson - A Tonight Special  and now I'm even more scared of this man.  He is a complete    LOON !   Lord ~ somebody take his money away from him, lock him up and throw away the key.

Even though we werent' rich, I pretty much got things I wanted.  I don't remember being denied anything.  I got my first piano at 8 [present for an aunt] so I was kinda set musically I guess.   3. What's the furthest from home you've been? The furthest I've been is Australia.  That holiday rocked!  I was away for 2 months.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet? Still getting to grips with my guitar.  I'd like to become profitient someday.  But I always wanted to learn to tap dance and now I'm too fat...LOL   5. What are your plans for the weekend?  None.

       TRAGEDY WAITING TO HAPPEN    urlLink Answers Sought in Space Shuttle Disaster   I can't understand why anyone would put themselves into such a risky position as to want to attempt space travel.  I think man should just stick to the Earth that the Lord has given them and appreciate the heavens, not try to reach them.   urlLink Bush says NASA's mission won't end: `Our journey into space will go on'     And then he [President Bush] quoted Scripture, his eyes glistening.   "The same Creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today. The crew of the shuttle Columbia did not return safely to Earth but we can pray that all are safely home," Bush said.    Scripture?  That's not scripture.   This  is scripture:  And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?  urlLink Job 38:11   Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?  urlLink Job 38:33   He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.  urlLink Job 41:34

      It was a shame to hear that professional footballer Marc-Vivien Foe  urlLink died on the football pitch during the Cameroon/Columbia world cup final , but I think it was in very poor taste for  urlLink The Sun  to plaster a picture of him lying on the ground nearly dead on their front page.  Poor taste is putting it midly.  Utterly despicable is more of an idea of how I feel about this.  I find it very disturbing.  I wonder whether they would have done that had David Beckham collapsed and died on the field.  Somehow, I think not...  My condolences to the Mrs Foe and the Foe family.

      Feeling real poorly today.  I think I'm coming down with flu.  I tell you, I must've had flu at least 3 times already this year. Why am I so weak [bodily] LOL.  It's not funny.  I don't like letting work down.  The weather is so nice outside and I've been inside all day, sneezing and spluttering.  This sucks!

       Saving My Bacon   I was almost the victim of fraud on eBay.  I had won  urlLink The Matrix Phone  and emailed the seller to confirm that this was a genuine item.  My two emails bounced, plus I noticed that the seller was 'unregistered' and I knew I wasn't going to part with any cash [nearly $600] until I saw photographic proof that this phone was in the owners possession.  Then, I noticed today that the email addy was different for the seller, so I sent one further email only to receive a reply that this seller's account had been hijacked and that in no circumstances was I to send any money.  Well,   PHEW   is all I can say to that!  Someone up there is watching over me...

       Friday Five   [A day late, nothing new there...]    1. If your life were a movie, what would the title be?  Nobody Said It Was Easy...   2. What songs would be on the soundtrack?  Every  urlLink Coldplay  song ever written/performed [including covers], including "The Scientist".   3. Would it be a live-action film or animated? Why?  Live Action - because of the next question...;)   4. Casting: who would play you, members of your family, friends, etc?  Keanu Reeves as himself - because he's a major part of my life.  I would be played by Halle Berry [we can all dream can't we...?].  Hubby would be played by Lenny Henry [coz he looks like him a bit]   5. Describe the movie preview/trailer.  Here's the tragic story of an obsessed fan who will go to any lengths to fulfil her ambition - to marry Keanu Reeves.  Then she wakes up.

       Ah Lazy dayz...   I've done nowt today.  I've had the day off and the weather has been quite miserable [raining constantly], so why bother doing out..?  I was rudely awakend by the postie, bearing gifts from  urlLink eBay , one of which was mangled and torn, all of which were covered by rain water   [grrrrrr]  .  They're so fecking useless these people.  The mangled/torn package was a couple of pictures from the movie Point Break and the seller had written all over the cardboard "Do Not Bend, Handle with care", but I guess there are some bad-minded people in this world...   urlLink

       Why...?   Are guys called Robert always  very  good looking...?  I've had this theory from my school days as there was one boy called Robert Hayes [not the  urlLink actor , but he was great looking in his  urlLink Airplane  days...] and he was drop dead gorgeous [I wonder what happened to him?].  And of course, there is a certain  urlLink drummer  in a certain  urlLink band , who's "nooooooot baaaaaaaad".  Robert is a good name.  It's Old German meaning "bright famous one."

       Just Shoot Me!   Had a gawd awful day today at work.  The cosmic forces were not working in my favour.   We were short of staff today so I had to serve on the counter most of the day  [and I really hate that!]     And there are some really obnoxious people on the earth....  One of my pet hates is someone coming up to me whilst they're chatting away on their mobile phone.  I think it's unbelievably rude.  Two women did this to me today.    Now, I could've said something, but I had to bite my tongue in case I go too far and end up getting reported.  So I just ignore them, carrying on with my work, until they got the message.  Then, gave them a glare to let them know I was not impressed.  Then, the ATM kept playing up, retaining people's cards for no reason.  Then we kept having 0.0000001 second power cuts, which restarted all the computers and messed even more with the ATM.    The security firm was a day late with people's travel money orders.  The guy came in grinning from ear to ear, as if nothing was wrong with the world, while we were getting it in the ear from irate customers.  Then he had the cheek to lie and say they turned up at 5.10 yesterday and we weren't there. EXCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUSE ME!  We were still serving customer's at 5.10 yesterday  and  we didn't leave the office until 5.30.  I could've smacked him one.  Why do people like to lie?  What's up with that??  I couldn't wait to get out of the place, I tell ya!  And, whilst driving like a bat out of hell to get home, some geezer has the cheek to beep  me  for going ahead of him at the roundabout.  The last time I looked,  the Highway Code says you give way to people  urlLink coming from your right  at the roundabout- not the other way round.  I just pulled the car to a halt and just shouted "You cannot be serious, YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!!" and almost got out of the car to bop him one in the head  [but, ya know, I didn't coz ya never know, he might be packin' or something...]   What ever happened to good manners.  Seems to be non-existant in this day and age.   Gee - I sound old...

       I'm So Tired...   I've been really tired lately.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's the weather - who knows...  On Friday I was a bit sleepy about 8pm and I thought, "Lemme just go lie down for a coupla hours".   I woke up the next day.   And it was sooooooo hard to get up this morning, but I did.  I got to work at 8.15am and waited for G.  He didn't get there until 8.30.  That's the last time I leave my house before 8am I'm telling you.   I ain't killing myself for this job. It's not worth it.

       This or that?    1. Surf sites at random, or have a set list of regular reads?  I have a regular list I visit daily, but if I've got time, I'll wander around a bit...   2. Do you visit mostly blogs, or news or other sites?  I visit news sites first then blog, then other sites.   3. Do you go online every day, or just a couple of days a week?  Every day baby.  I get withdrawal symptoms otherwise...LOL   4. Do you allow comments on your blog, or not?  Of course - not that it's always utilitised.   5. Do you shop online at all, or at regular stores?  I like shopping online.  I can't be dealing with all those people.  I get clautrophobic.   6. Have you ever done online bill-paying/banking, or not?  All the time.  [why are you asking this question? LOL]    7. Which news site do you prefer... MSNBC.com or CNN.com? Or do you prefer some other one?  I don't visit newsite per se, but news aggregators like Google or Yahoo!]   8. Live chat rooms, or message boards?  Messageboard baby.  I own one.   9. Instant messaging or e-mail?  Email preferably but I do like to chat sometimes [again, if I have time]   10. Yes or no: have you ever met, or at least talked on the phone with, another blogger? If not, would you want to? Why or why not?  I've met  urlLink krix  and a bunch of gals from the  urlLink becky mailing list .  That was fun  [we must to it again soon...]

       YOUNG, GIFTED AND BLACK   Went and saw my nephew's band "29" perform today.  It was my first time and they just blew me away.  I didn't know his was so talented, up there wowing the crowd with his lyrical rapping style and charismatic persona.  He had them in a frenzy.  I really didn't know he had it in him - he's usually very quiet.  I hope they make it big - they deserve it.  You made me proud Chas.

       WHERE AM I??   Ok, I'm right here!  Um - what have I been up too lately...?  Well...  The job's going good.  The staff are a good bunch and the work isn't too taxing on my brain.  It was hubby's birthday   yesterday   2 days ago [see, I don't even know what day it is LOL].  I didn't get him anything [I can't tell you why, that's private :p].  He understands...  I've now got  urlLink 'the world's most powerful vacuum cleaner' , which is made by  urlLink Dyson .  It's quite cool really - a purple and lime green colour [Mr Dyson sure like dem funky colours LOL] and it sucks up a storm.  So, I guess he ain't lyin'.  The website is running a colouring compo.  I've been spending ages colouring in my Dyson.  It's kinda relaxing.  Why don't you  urlLink have a go .  It seems that  urlLink eBay is going kinda lame .  I'm glad we don't get those ads in the UK.  And  urlLink this  is a bad website, but it's sooooooo funny.

I'm not one for having 'leaving do's' coz it's a foreign thing to me.  I go to other people's 'leaving do's' but don't have any of my own coz I really haven't 'left' [I've been in the company nearly 14 years], I've just moved on.  I did get a coula nice leaving gifts - a gold bracelet and a vase [and I thought they didn't like me...LOL]  Glad to be shot of the place I can tell you.

       A DAY FROM HELL   What a fecking awful day I've had today.  Where do I begin to tell you.  I think it's some cosmic joke and I'm the butt of it...  1)  Stupid fecking bitch parks right in the middle of the road and I can't get past [I've only driven 2 corners away from my house].  She says I can get past, but there's a fecking car parked on the side of the road, which PREVENTS me from getting past and there was a perfectly good gap on her side of the road that she could've gone into in order for me to get past.  Man, I wanted to get out of the car and slap her!  People like that should be getting the bus, not driving on the road.  2) This incident made me irritable for the rest of the day.  Funny how something so small can bug so much.  I must be getting my period soon...  3)  Every other customer at work was an IGNORANT WRETCH.  We have 2 new starters which I have to keep an eye on. They're not the fastest guns in the West so you have to have patience.  This one woman was so horrible to one of them, which just made me even madder.    4) One other guy when I told him he couldn't do what he came in to do asked for the manger. " I AM THE MANAGER!" [feck head].   I managed to swing him round to my point of view and he left a happy chap.   5)  The Iranian Siamese Twins  urlLink have died .  I was so rooting for them.  I'm so bummed out...

       THAT WAS THE DAY THAT WAS   Work is kinda hectic at the moment, but the good news is I'M LEAVING!!  YAY!   I've got another managerial role in another branch.  My present branch is kinda overcrowded anyho [and looking more and more like the core of the Neb as we're being refurbished].  But, the bad news is - we got robbed today.  Not a heist or anything, but some cheeky buggers stole a cheque from us.  I can't believe people's barefacedness.  This makes me  really  angry and I hope they rot in  HELL!

       T4T - OK MAKE THAT 8    1. I'm looking forward to....   Another excellent adventure, hopefully before the year's out.   2. I'm dreading .....   Dread is something I don't actually associate myself with...    Whilst of the subject of questions, I was interviewed by  urlLink skits  recently.  Here's my answers below.     1. When did you start blogging? Who introduced to you to it?    I started blogging on 30th June 2002. I visited krix's  urlLink website   [hadn't been there for ages]  and noticed  urlLink the blog  thing and that it was  urlLink everywhere  and I was missing out LOL.  My life is totally boring so I decided to  urlLink blog  about  urlLink Keanu    [although I do have this personal blog too].     2. Alternate Universe: There is no Keanu. Who else would you do a fansite for?    I wouldn't bother. If it wasn't for  urlLink Keanu , I wouldn't be bothered with the internet. It's the only way to fly though when it comes to up to date  urlLink news  on  The One...     3. Your perfect day, beginning to end.     My perfect LIFE would be being married to Keanu and being the mother of his children LOL    A perfect day would go kinda like this. I'd be in some exotic location on holiday. Get up a little latter than usual. Take in the sights with My Beloved, have dinner at a nice bistro, maybe take in a show or a flick, go home and...well..ya know...;)    4. 3 songs you can't live without.    1)  urlLink  Daylight    [ urlLink Coldplay ]    2)  urlLink  In my Place    [ urlLink Coldplay ]   3)  urlLink  The Scientist    [ urlLink Coldplay - See a pattern emerging here...LOL ]    Damn - I lied - I also need " urlLink Everything's not Lost "  [best song ever written].   urlLink   HECK!  I NEED ALL OF COLDPLAY'S SONGS!!      3 songs that should have never been made.     Hard question because there are some MANY  urlLink crappy songs  out there....    1)  urlLink Agadoo  [why?]  2)  urlLink The Chicken Song  [WTF?]   3)  urlLink The Birdie Song  [The less said about that the better...]    5. Which British stereotype would you most like to dispel?    That we're winging Poms  [well, not all of us are...]    And that it's raining all the time over here. Clearly it  urlLink isn't...

I haven't personalised this phone yet, but I want to get a  urlLink Matrixy  ring-tone or maybe I'll get around to composing a  urlLink becky  bassline...;)   2. Do you pay bills via USPS or via Online?  Online baby, online... [and direct debit of course...]

        urlLink FRIDAY FIVE  ON SUNDAY    1)What's the last place you traveled to, outside your own home state/country?  I last visited LA to see  urlLink becky  perform.  I went to 2 concerts, which was a fantastic birthday present to myself..;)   2. What's the most bizarre/unusual thing that's ever happened to you while traveling?  Getting stared at a lot when I was in Singapore and Australia.  What?  Haven't you seen a black person before??   3. If you could take off to anywhere, money and time being no object, where would you go?  I would go wherever Keanu Reeves is - I'd stick to him like glue.   4. Do you prefer traveling by plane, train or car?  I like cars [terra firma and all that], but planes are ok [although I'm more scarred of them now, than when I was younger...] and trains are ok [overground, not underground coz I hate the tube...]   5. What's the next place on your list to visit?  Canada - I'd love to go there and take a look around - meet up with  urlLink Maeve .  That would be cool...

       AS THE SONG GOES...    urlLink It's too DARN Hot!   But, you won't catch me outside soaking up the rays.  That's for crazy people LOL.    Even though I'm of West Indian origin, I was born here so I'm not used to hot hot weather.  When I was in Greece a few years back, I nearly died of heat stroke, so I stay out of the sun nowadays.  Luckily, my house is small so it stays cool and my work has the bestest air conditioning on the planet!  It even caused one person to comment "You have the coolest branch ever!"  I'll take that compliment on both counts...:D

       ANOTHER EMBARASSING MOMENT   Met this man and a little boy at work today.  I asked the little boy 'Is that your Grandad?' and the man replied 'No, I'm his DAD!'.  The man was 70 years old.  He was a little indignant at me, but how was I supposed to know.     Gee - it's nice to know that the ol' 'equipment' is still working well into old age...LOL

       I know it's Thursday, but you know me, I'm never on time...LOL   Thanks to  urlLink Laura  for these  urlLink Two for Tuesday  questions.  They're good questions...   1. Whose celebrity (famous person or persons) death really affected you?   1) PRINCESS DIANA - that upset me a lot because all I thought about was her boys.  They were so young to be bereft of their mother.  When I found out it was horrible.  I went to the funeral [along with the other 100,000 people].  I was so distressed I got my period straight away.  2) THE QUEEN MOTHER - I had just started my holiday down in Devon when we arrived at the cottage, I found out that she had died and spent the first few days of the holiday glued to the TV watching the coverage.  I guess when Princess Margaret died, she couldn't go on any longer.  That was another sad day [not as sad as Diana dying, but sad all the same].  But, she had a GREAT innings bless her soul.   Reincarnation - to be? or not to be? Your thoughts on the afterworld....   Don't believe in it...you only have one life.

       SUCH A DOZY MARE SOMETIMES...   Lost my purse the other day.  Outside my house if you would believe it...  I had to have all my cards stopped, which is a right pain the arse.  It was a good job I'd ordered a new bank card [which arrived the same day, funnily enough] coz the old one was a little 'used'...  The thing that is gutting me the most is I had my last 'Shane Falco Football Card' in there.  I've   lost   mislaid the remaining few I had in this very room [which is choca block with Ke stuff].  So, bought a new purse today and the only reason why I chose it was it has 3 sections in which to put Keanu photos...LOL    urlLink

      I gave an interview to the  urlLink Sunday Times  and it's been published!!!!!!    urlLink  Focus: Britain goes loan crazy   Money is cheap and the living is easy. As consumers rack up record amounts of debt, our correspondent reports on our increasing willingness to chase dreams with credit - and the risks it poses  When it comes to her obsession with Keanu Reeves, Jennifer John, an assistant bank manager from Walthamstow, will stop at nothing. The trousers and T-shirt that Reeves wore in the film Speed have pride of place in her ?140,000 east London terraced house, which overflows with memorabilia of the Hollywood star.   &#8220;Obviously he&rsquo;s handsome but I find him an intriguing person, too,&#8221; explained John, 32, who claims that her husband, a computer engineer, is happy to tolerate her love of all things Reeves. &#8220;Keanu rarely speaks about himself or his innermost feelings, which adds to the mystery.&#8221;   Flying around the world to see the enigmatic actor &#8212; she gave him a kiss at the Cannes film festival &#8212; is expensive, but affordable thanks to easily available credit.  To finance her passion, John has taken out ?20,000 of loans from her employer, the Halifax, at 6.9% interest. &#8220;The fact that money is cheap to borrow has been a big factor,&#8221; she said, &#8220;It has all been worth it &#8212; Keanu actually recognises me and gave me a wave when I was in Los Angeles.&#8221;   John is part of Britain&rsquo;s boom in borrowing to fund not essentials but lifestyles, hobbies and eccentric fascinations. It is a phenomenon fuelled by the lowest interest rates for 48 years.    To read the rest of the article  urlLink click here  [I'm not the only crazy person in the world....]   If hubby sees this, he'll go mental! LOL   You gotta realise this has been over a 12 year period...

Have you been doing that, Gemini: cultivating the green bough in your heart? Even when the world around you has been a barren wasteland? If so, the singing bird will alight on your inviting perch very soon. If you haven't, get to work immediately and the singing bird may yet arrive by mid-October.

       IT'S ALL IN THE VOICE    urlLink Fran  has a discussion on his blog about our 'work voices' - how we change the way we speak in a different environment.  Hubby goes 'real' Cockney at work.  When I phone him, I hardly recognise him and he keeps saying 'mate' all the time.  Drives me nuts.  He's being 'one of the lads'.  I on the other hand have many different 'work voices', but it depends on who I'm dealing with.  Sometimes, I'm dead posh, if I'm dealing with a hoity toity type and I don't want to come across uneducated...LOL  Sometimes I'm normal and then 'sub-normal' [i.e. I talk real 'street' with colleagues and some customers if I can get away with it].  Sometimes I sound like a 12 year old, if I'm trying to appear humble in order to get someone to do something for me and then, I have my 'don't mess with me I AM THE LAW!' voice, where someone doesn't appear to be understand that no means NO and don't even  bother  to try to take me on coz you won't win.  There - you know all my secrets now...

       T4T THEN OFFLINE I GO...   Coz it's my  Wedding Anniversary  today!    8 years of   hell   bliss!  [kidding...]    [And I guess I have to spend   some   time with the old man today...LOL]   My  urlLink Two for Tuesday  are as follows:   1. Who was your favorite teacher? Why?   Mr Squires!  That man ROCKED!!  He always had time for us kids and he was like a father to me in some respects.   [My dad left home when I was 2 so I didn't have a father figure type to look up to.]   And the man knew his stuff.  He was my Business Studies teacher and made us work...LOL  I got a good 'O Level' result because of him.   2. Do you have a memorable moment from highschool? What was it? Whether it was scoring the winning touchdown or falling down the bleachers...share with us.   I just used to enjoy the music I made whilst at school.  We didn't have a very good music cirriculum  [although, we had a wicked steel band, which I was in, of course...]  so I attended the  urlLink Centre for Young Musicians   [which ran every Saturday]  to study the flute, piano and voice and to do my 'O Level' Music and I attended residential courses during the holidays, which I enjoyed immensely.  I made my way through the ranks from  The London School Concert Band  to  The London School Symphonic Band  to  The London Schools Symphony Orchestra   [the 'LSSO', where I was joint Principal flute and piccolo]  to  The London Youth Symphonic Band ,  [which was a totally rad ensemble and we played fantastic 'pops' music.]    And we used to play all the best venues, like  urlLink The Royal Albert Hall ,  urlLink The Royal Festival Hall ,  urlLink Kenwood Lakeside  and  urlLink The Barbican .  We even toured  urlLink Spain  a couple of times, which was an excellent experience.  Gee, I miss the good 'ol days....

Whaddya think?  Ya like it...??         Just need to curl the ends of a mornin' and I'm sorted!  Normally, I'm really boring with my hair.  Either I just fling it in a ponytail or sometimes I have a giant twist at the side.  Boring, boring boring...  I really need to make more of an effort.  P.S.  Like my Matrix Reloaded top?

       THANKS BILL!   I was over at  urlLink William Gibson's  blog and he's linked to a site which gives all sorts of 'readings'.  Here's  urlLink mine .   Tarot Card  (Equivalent of my DOB)   The Hierophant:  Faith in tradition and the old school. A justified and ancient source of power. Being supportive, sympathetic and loyal. Receiving instructions, learning, guidance or inspiration. The ability to hear a higher or inner voice. May also indicate a religious ritual, such as a marriage or an initiation.    Rune  (Equivalent of my real Name)   Fehu  represents cattle the Norse symbol of wealth. This rune has some interesting implications based on the fact that cattle, unlike land, move about of their own accord. Cattle also reproduce, so this rune often speaks of wealth that renews or perpetuates itself. Wealth takes many forms, but this rune generally represents the value that is purely material or monetary in nature. Alternatively, this rune is deeply associated with Frey, and hence can be the harbinger of fertility and children.   Public Role  (Equivalents of "Keanuette")  Words that embody your presence are "Mercenary  [moi?],  Oyster  [ok...?] ".  Words that embody people or things in your periphery are "Asia, Axe, Baby, Beer, Bread, Chemistry, Computer, Day, Fact, Fascination, Fear, Fortress, Gin, Illuminati, Illusion, Lace, Peace, Perfection, Periphery, Question, Security, Slaughter, Strength, Web".   Private Persona  (Equivalents of "Nettie")  Words that embody your presence are "Circus, Copper, Crown, Hermit, Hunger, Invader, Nation, Number, Obelisk, Pulse, Sacrifice, Sound, Stone".  Words that embody the people or things that you interact with are "Drama, Hell".  [fraid so...]   Words that embody people or things in your periphery are "Anonymity, Exhaustion, Satisfaction  [Hell ya baby!] ,  urlLink Syzygy ".  Syzygy - wasn't there an  urlLink X-Files  episode of that name??  [that was a good episode]   Well -that's me alright!  There's a lot of truth in them there runes.  If you notice, it says that  urlLink WG  and I are "Birth Mates".  What? - I swear,  I've never met him in my life...LOL

       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED   Thanks to hubby for spotting this gem of a movie called  urlLink Nine Queens , which we've just finished viewing.   The film is by Agentinian director Fabian Bielinsky.  Man!  it has so many twists and turns it's not funny, but that's the whole point, it keeps you guessing and was fun to watch.  So stick this in your  urlLink Netflix  queue or just  urlLink buy it .  You can view the trailer  urlLink here .    urlLink

       WORK, WORK, FECKING WORK   I really thought I'd like working where I am now, but I was mistaken.  I love my colleagues - THEY RULE!  But, it doesn't matter where you work, there'll always be something that grates you.  This time, it's snotty wretches who think they know it all and are too demanding of my time, which I don't have  to give.  I just wanna swear at them sometimes, but I can't.  So - to the snotty cow that got on my nerves on Monday and to the other folks that are a daily thorn in my side with their crappy nonsense -   PISS OFF!     Maybe I should invest in a punchbag...

       TWOSDAY TUESDAY   Here's my reply to  urlLink Two for Tuesday .   1. Did you watch the Jerry Lewis Telethon? Do you normally watch it every year?  Nope coz I live in the UK and we don't get it here...   2. Do you give money to charities or organizations and if so, which ones? If not, which would you like to donate to? Why?   I originally had an affinity credit card which donated to the  urlLink British Heart Foundation , but I now support the  urlLink NSPCC   [a very worthy cause]  and  urlLink Breast Cancer Research   [through  urlLink Keanu , thank you]  and my work supports a lot of charities so I can donate when I can.  The last one being  urlLink MacMillan Cancer Research .

       UM.....   Sorry - I've not been bloggin'.  I've been otherwise  urlLink occupied .  Just been to watch  urlLink Once Upon a time in Mexico  - with Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp and Salma Hayek.  It was  very  good, but not as good as  urlLink Desperado  [which is basically, the dog's b*llocks].  Antonio Banderas is a sexy mo'fo I'm telling you!!  Geez - Melanie whatsherface sure is a lucky gal.  He just oozes sex appeal.  And Salma - all I have to say is 'whoa'.  She's hot that's for sure.  Johnny Depp is hillarious in this movie.  He has the right amount of humour and is a trouble-making wretch LOL.  I had some good giggles at his antics.  Go see the movie.

I'm so glad I don't suffer from  urlLink this .  When I see too much text, my eyes just glaze over.  Talking of horoscopes, here's  urlLink mine  for this week   *eek*     As your mating season gets into full swing, I suggest you browse through a book called Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation, by evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson. Your mind may be blown wide open as you learn how experimental some animals are in their approach to sex. You'll read, for example, about dolphins that try to copulate with turtles and seals, orangutans that masturbate with sex toys made of leaves and twigs, female chimpanzees that average ten trysts a day with numerous lovers, homosexual romps among manatees, and female seahorses that impregnate their male partners. I'm hoping that by expanding your definition of what's "natural," you'll lose any shame you might still have about your own harmless though exotic erotic tastes.

Lucy Liu was perfectly evil and it was great to see Daryl Hannah in a movie [been a loooooooong time a comin'].

       UPLIFTED WITH SONG   I went to see Steff the other day [it was her birthday].  I was walking through Oxford Circus tube when I heard a busker singing one of my favourite songs - "Under the Bridge" by the  urlLink Red Hot Chili Peppers .    He sang so well.  He had a really clear, pure voice and did the song justice.  It made me want to stop and listen to the whole song, but I had to be on my way.  I gave him a few bob for his effort.  I wonder if he gave guitar lessons...    UNDER THE BRIDGE - RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS   Sometimes I feel like i dont have a partner Sometimes i feel like my only friend Is the city I live in The City of Angel Lonely as i am Together we cry I drive all the streets Cuz she's my companion I walk through the hills Cuz she knows who I am She sees my good deeds And she kisses the windy I never worry Now that is a lie And i dont ever wanna feel Like I did that day Take me to the place i love Take me all the way I dont ever wanna feel Like i did that day Take me to the place i love Take me all the way It's hard to believe that There's nobody out there It's hard to believe That I'm all alone At least i have heard of the city she loves me Lonely as i am Together we cry And i dont ever wanna feel Like I did that day Take me to the place i love Take me all the way I dont ever wanna feel Like i did that day Take me to the place i love Take me all the way   Don't waste your time It's where i drew some blood Don't waste your time I could not get enough Don't waste your time I forgot about my love Don't waste your time I gave my life away

      Vanessa Lucero, a 14-year-old New Mexico girl, is your role model this week. In October, she was named homecoming princess at her high School.

During the span of a few glorious hours, she wore both a helmet and a tiara. Like Vanessa, you  urlLink Geminis  now have the potential to notch triumphs in two separate spheres using different sets of skills.

      Yep - been real foggy today in good 'ol London Town, which reminds me of this great Gershwin song, sang by the fabulous Ella Fitzgerald.  Now  urlLink this  is definatley worth buying.   urlLink      urlLink  A Foggy Day   [Lyrics by Ira Gershwin]  I was a stranger in the city. Out of town were the people I knew. I had that feeling of self-pity: What to do? What to do? What to do? The outlook was decidedly blue. But as I walked through the foggy streets alone, It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known  [REFRAIN:] A foggy day in London Town Had me low and had me down.  I viewed the morning with alarm. The British Museum had lost its charm.  How long, I wondered, could this thing last? But the age of miracles, hadn't passed,  For, suddenly, I saw you there -- And through foggy London Town The sun was shining ev'rywhere.

      Got out of work at 5.10pm and thought 'Beauty - I'm out early can get home and do my thang'.  I got to the car and looked inside and there was something on the seat.  I thought to myself 'I didn't put that there' and then I realised there was glass all over the place.  Some bugger had broken into my car.  So, I spent the next 2 hours having the passenger window replaced [2 hours I'll  never  get back].  Bloody hell - there wasn't anything inside the car worth knicking.  Becky and Dogstar CDs don't go down so well...LOL]  In the meantime, I made two new friends.  My mobile phone wasn't charged so I walked over to the minicab office and asked to use the phone.  The guy in there was very accomodating and we got chatting about various life issues - you know.  If I could turn back the clock what would I do -  sometimes you just gotta take a chance and change your direction - the loss of parents, things like that.  His name was Benson and he was from Nigeria.  The way he spoke about his home country made me want to visit there.  I know it's a corrupt government, but I've never visited the continent of Africa and would like to someday.  The place that fitted the glass was a stones throw away from work so I drove the car there and caught the guy just as he was coming back from one job and on his way to another one.  He took pity on me and fixed the glass straight away.  Turns out the guy lives about quarter a mile away from me!  It IS a small world after all, innit...?  After the fiasco, I didn't feel like going home so I dropped by my sister.  She has two beautiful daughters [my gorgeous nieces] and I love hanging out with them because they crack me up no end.  Last night was no exception.  My younger niece has been nagging me to get her a mobile phone.  I resisted because I'm against all these youngsters posing with phones, which can get knicked off them at any given time, but I think I'm starting to turn soft and might get her one.  My older niece did my hair for me [the roots was real baaaaaaaaaad].  She's such a gem!  There was a show on at 9pm about the little boy who had his twin brother growing inside of him for 7 years and was operated on earlier this year.  They showed pictures of his distended stomach and his parents were scared to take him to hospital until someone urged them to go.  The mother's pregnancy was what is called a 'fetal in fetal' pregnancy and they proceeded to talk about other cases, one in the US and one here.  The boy was from Kazakstan and his mother was ostracised by the community as being 'abnormal'.  I mean, it's a one in a billion freak accident of nature.  People can be so ignorant and prejudiced.    This Canadian professor of fetal studies visited Kazakstan to examine the 'twin' which obviously did not survive the operation as it wasn't a whole baby [they showed the 'specimen' and it had sort of legs and arms and part of a head with hair on it - pretty bogus, especially if you're eating!].  She reassured the mother that she wasn't abnormal and really put her mind at rest.  Fancy carrying that burden for 7 years.  The little boy is fully recovered from the op and will grow up normal.  I'm just glad that the odds of that happening are very slight and that most humans are born healthy and whole.  It was just an unfortunate occurance.

       urlLink     urlLink Which Historical Lunatic Are  You ?    urlLink From the fecund loins of Rum and Monkey.    You are Joshua Abraham Norton, first and only Emperor of the United States of America!   Born in England sometime in the second decade of the nineteenth century, you carved a notable business career, in South Africa and later San Francisco, until an entry into the rice market wiped out your fortune in 1854. After this, you became quite different. The first sign of this came on September 17, 1859, when you expressed your dissatisfaction with the political situation in America by declaring yourself Norton I, Emperor of the USA. You remained as such, unchallenged, for twenty-one years.   Within a month you had decreed the dissolution of Congress. When this was largely ignored, you summoned all interested parties to discuss the matter in a music hall, and then summoned the army to quell the rebellious leaders in Washington. This did not work. Magnanimously, you decreed (eventually) that Congress could remain for the time being. However, you disbanded both major political parties in 1869, as well as instituting a fine of $25 for using the abominable nickname "Frisco" for your home city.   Your days consisted of parading around your domain - the San Francisco streets - in a uniform of royal blue with gold epaulettes. This was set off by a beaver hat and umbrella. You dispensed philosophy and inspected the state of sidewalks and the police with equal aplomb. You were a great ally of the maligned Chinese of the city, and once dispersed a riot by standing between the Chinese and their would-be assailants and reciting the Lord's Prayer quietly, head bowed.  Once arrested, you were swiftly pardoned by the Police Chief with all apologies, after which all policemen were ordered to salute you on the street. Your renown grew. Proprietors of respectable establishments fixed brass plaques to their walls proclaiming your patronage; musical and theatrical performances invariably reserved seats for you and your two dogs. (As an aside, you were a good friend of Mark Twain, who wrote an epitaph for one of your faithful hounds, Bummer.) The Census of 1870 listed your occupation as "Emperor".   The Board of Supervisors of San Francisco, upon noticing the slightly delapidated state of your attire, replaced it at their own expense. You responded graciously by granting a patent of nobility to each member. Your death, collapsing on the street on January 8, 1880, made front page news under the headline "Le Roi est Mort". Aside from what you had on your person, your possessions amounted to a single sovereign, a collection of walking sticks, an old sabre, your correspondence with Queen Victoria and 1,098,235 shares of stock in a worthless gold mine. Your funeral cortege was of 30,000 people and over two miles long.   The burial was marked by a total eclipse of the sun.

       IT'S A GOOD FEELING   I went to do cover over at another branch today and the staff there all loved me and want me to stay.  The Branch Manager is going to ask if I can transfer over and 'sort 'em out'.  It's good to feel wanted and appreciated.    The area is lovely in terms of amenities.  Nice shops all around and parking ain't so bad.  They have a  urlLink Marks & Spencer  foodhall [that would be my 2nd home, I'm telling you].  Only thing is the travelling.  It would take 45 mins in the morning and an hour plus to get back.  That's the only bumming thing about it coz I  really  hate traffic.  The branch itself is nice and the customers are ok.  There were one or two who were a bit shirty today, but me being me dealt with them the only way I know how - kill 'em with kindness.  They leave singing a different tune after I'm done with them...

       BLOG BLOG SPLOG   I've been so  tired lately, what with going back to work a tad too early, not having fully recovered from the flu [they needed me] and working on my  urlLink site  'n stuff.  Wipes a girl out, I tell ya!  Not much has been happening other than me trying to get through the day without smacking someone in the mouth.  Some customers at work are just so flipping RUDE!  One guy, who couldn't get what he wanted at closing time barged past the girl on the door and nearly knocked her flying.  We got a warning from another branch earlier in the day that someone was on their way down to us in a rage because they asked for their jeans to be delivered to US from the catalogue people and if they're not there, she's going to go ballistic.  We're a freaking BANK for crying out loud, not your personal delivery depot.  How facety  is  that?  She didn't show up.  If she did, I would have been first in line to deal with her.  Another woman went mental because she couldn't take money from her hubby's account.   HELLO!!    These are trying times for the weary soul, I'm telling you.  It's a wonder I haven't cracked up yet.

       CONTRADICTIONS CONTRADICTIONS   My survey of New Year's resolutions by  urlLink Geminis  reveals some surprising trends. Twenty-one percent of you have vowed to lose weight in 2004, but 26 percent of you hope to gain weight. Thirty-six percent of you plan to launch a new hobby, whereas 58 percent want to get rid of one of your hobbies so as to have more time for the others. While 31 percent of you are plotting to supercharge your ambitions or career, 42 percent of you are quite sure you want to work less and cultivate more leisure and luxury. Finally, 16 percent of you want more "espresso sex" -- quickies with casual acquaintances -- while 69 percent have your hearts set on deep, slow, cozy love-making with emotionally intelligent partners who crave cuddling.   I'm more for the latter halves myself...that's the kind of Gemini I am.

      Went to work yesterday and hurt my back whilst opening the ATM!    I worked a few hours more until I couldn't take the pain any longer and left to go to the doc.  She said I'd pulled a muscle and that I need to do stretching execerises.  How can I do stretching excercises if I'm in PAIN!  She gave me these 'drugs' which I'm telling you, messed with me big time.  I started to feel very sottish and out of it I'd called the director of the WSO to tell him I wasn't coming, but his phone was on ansaphone.  So, towards about 5pm, I was feeling the drugs kick in [as in the pain subsided], so I went down to the rehersal, because I had felt bad.   There would have been no chance of him finding a replacement 'replacement' at such short notice.  All in all, the session was great!   I was on 2nd flute, which suited me fine.  It was a little hard getting back into the habit but the girl next to me [who was playing the piccolo] was very helpful [and very sweet].  Her name's Jen too, so that can't be bad...;)  We mainly played Leonard Bernstein's 'On the Waterfront', which I tell you, is not an easy piece to sight read for the first time....ever!  It's basically in 7/4 time [4/4 then 3/4] and changes between lento and vivace [slow and fast to lay people], so I was all over the place until I got used to keeping time.  And, it's always difficult to count endless bars at a time, waiting to come in again...  I must say, there's a flute solo in it that's completely exquisite.  Pity it wasn't played as well as it could have been.  The girl who played 1st flute completely mangled it, much to my dismay.  Oh well, it was only for one night....  I'm on the list if they ever need cover again.  I really did enjoy it.

        Gemini 	 You are having problems dealing with your split personality. My advice to you is take the praise for all the good you do and blame all your f*ck ups on your evil twin sister that you just discovered on the new friends-reunited site. With your golden tongue and smart charm you will have everyone convinced. Just watch out she does not stab you in the back. That's exactly what I've been doing this week. I don't know what's wrong with my brain, but it hasn't been working properly the past few days.  I've become very forgetful and a bit 'air-headed'.  Things told to me have not sunk in.  And I left a customer waiting nearly 20 mins today, because I forgot to buzz someone upstairs to let them know they were here.  Obviously, I easily got out of the situation because I had commented on how cool his trainers were after within the first 5 mins of meeting him, so I was in his good books already...;)  As I've just been saying to my mate Stef - I'm black on the outside, blonde on the inside....  On the praise front, I can't stand it when people take credit [and  bribes  financial reward] for work they didn't instigate, which I had to point out to my boss yesterday when she handed a fiver to one of the sales reps for work *I* had done...  And I could have really done with that fiver [I don't get paid until Monday].

      I've just received an email from the Director of the  urlLink Wandsworth Symphony Orchestra .  He's asked me to fill in for one of their flautists [who has had to go away on business] on Wednesday, which is in  2 DAYS TIME!!   Gosh!   I haven't really played in ages and I emailed around some ensembles to see if they had any vacancies months and months ago.  I didn't think I'd get a response, so this is cool.  I'm a little nervous though, but I guess it's just like riding a bycicle and all that...  Wish me luck!

       Happy Valentine Daze, Gemini! After careful meditation about what advice would be most likely to energize your love life, I've decided to suggest that you say your prayers while having sex with a saint in a sacred place. If you can't manage all that at once, at least try praying while doing the wild thing, or fooling around with a saint, or making out in a church or temple, or talking dirty to God. One way or another, Gemini, you should blend earthly pleasures and spiritual aspirations. Here's a quote to write on your mirror or your forearm: "I never knew how to worship until I knew how to love." - Henry Ward Beecher.   From  urlLink FreewillAstrology.com

      Had the most horrendous day again at work today.  I don't know what's happening, but Mondays and Saturdays are getting busier and busier.  It's driving me crazy.  I had to cover Reception - my favourite job in the world,  not!   I really don't have patience enough for such an arduous task and it began to show towards the latter part of the day.  This man just irritated me so much, when he kept asking the same thing over and over.   I just glared at him.  He got the message and left the branch soon afterwards...;)  Why are people so thick? And why do they have to be told more than once?  What?  Did you not understand the word NO the first time I told you?  Don't  make  me repeat myself...  It's like, I tell them we can't do this or that for them and they're like 'But...but'...I'm like 'No buts, we can't do it, end of story'.    COMPRENDE?

      From  urlLink Sunday Brunch   Here's last Sunday's questions as this Sunday's aren't my cup of Tetley...   1. What type(s) of camera do you have?  Fuji Finepix 400 - a really good camera [at the time].  It records up to 80 secs of video and can store MP3s too!   2. Do you store your pictures in a box, photo album or on your computer?  Digital pix are on the 'puter and on CD.  Normal pix are in albums and some in the original wallets as I haven't gotten around to putting them in albums yet.   3. What is your favorite thing to take pictures of?   Family.  I love taking pictures of get togethers.  I have lots of nephews and nieces [all a bit mad like me] and just seeing them growing up over the years through the camera lense is a real joy.   4. What is the biggest size photo you have hanging in your home?   A portrait of hubby and I in the living room.  It's done on canvas paper, so it looks like a proper painting.   5. Do you like having your picture taken?    I liked having my picture taken more when I was slimmer.  I always look fat in the pix these days [that's coz you  are  fat Jen].    And...     urlLink Unconscious Mutterings     Dogma:: Kevin Smith  Spirit:: Holy  Voodoo:: Queens  Demon:: Constantine  Digital:: Camera  Ceremony:: Wedding  Research:: Cancer  Career:: Non-existent  Penis:: Bigger  Film:: Noir Thanks  urlLink R-J.

        Gemini  If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun is rising about a minute earlier each morning and setting a minute later every evening. As a result, you're drinking in about 15 minutes more sunlight every week. The psychological effect of this steady influx has been slowly growing, and, in concert with certain astrological influences, will soon reach critical mass. As a result, you will become sun-like: a luminous beacon of warmth. Everything you shine upon will look brighter, and your own beauty will be highly visible, too. It will be a perfect time, therefore, to make a dramatic move that helps you pursue your dreams harder and smarter.    Thanks  urlLink  Rob

      From  urlLink The Smoking Gun   APRIL 29--Meet Harriette "Dolly" Kelton. The 97-year-old Texas woman--yes, 97--was arrested last week for driving her 1991 Honda Accord with an expired registration. After cops pulled Dolly over, they discovered that she had not paid a ticket previously issued for the same expired registration (and for which a warrant was lodged). Kelton, who was headed to a beauty salon appointment, was cuffed and instead taken to the Highland Park Police Department, where she posed for the below mug shot. After about two hours in custody, Dolly was released on her own recognizance and returned to her Dallas home. The nonagenarian's arrest, of course, has generated significant media interest, and even got Dolly a free trip to New York to schmooze today with Matt and Katie on the Today Show.

      I do want to blog about my LA adventures.  There is so much that I've seen and experienced in the 2 weeks that I was there.  I need to gather my thoughts.  However, I will say this.  I saw ' urlLink Monster ' on the plane home today and boy did Charlize Theron deserve her Oscar.  That film was amazing and I was very moved by the whole situation [Aileen Wuornos' abuse as a child that need to be loved by whoever, it doesn't matter if it's male or female her sense of power as she killed those men and the needful betrayal at the end]. Charlize's performance was excellent - I wept buckets.  I'm weeping just typing this post, the film had such an effect on me.  Well done there girl...

       urlLink  Gemini     Seeing as how you're at the peak of your popularity and in the harvest phase of your yearly cycle, why not suggest to your friends that they organize a celebration in your honor? A parade could launch the festivities, with you riding in a red Cadillac convertible followed by floats depicting the turning points in your life. When you arrive at the banquet hall, you'll be carried on a litter to a throne. You'll eat a gourmet dinner featuring your favorite food while a series of allies comes to the microphone to describe what they like most about you. To conclude the party, a band will play a set of songs written especially for you. These are merely suggestions, Gemini. You may have different ideas about how you'd like to be glorified. Just make sure you communicate them clearly to the proper people.   Ok, who wants to go first...?  I'm available between the 13th-20th of April...

      ...and get away with it.  I've used about 10 of these just this week...:)   1. When ridiculed for making comments that are deemed senseless, claim you are being criticized for merely voicing your beliefs. Use emotional wording and voice tone to gain sympathy from those who don't see through your bullshit.  2. If attacked by someone who claims you have not seen or read about something you claim to know about, deny. Address their requests for proof with a change of subject or anger for daring to question your honesty.  3. If repeatedly corrected after saying numerous incorrect things pertaining to a certain subject, claim the person notifying you of your errors is an "asshole" or a "loser with no life who can't get laid." Claim you "have a life" and thus didn't have the time to learn things this other person does know. Ignore the fact that your claiming to "having a life" contradicts the fact you took the time to point that out.  4. Engage in debates of creationism and evolution with the belief you are undoubtedly right, meanwhile being sure you'll eventually succeed in projecting your beliefs onto others but failing to realize the pointlessness of the argument. Be sure to either note the person(s) is without faith or without common sense.  5. Believe you are well-informed about world events because you watch the news on TV and/or read the newspaper. Use this to teach those who don't bother attempting to keep track of news events your version of world events to be perceived as a well-informed citizen, possibly even an intellect by their standards.  6. Observe a social situation in which various people offer differing viewpoints on a subject and comment on the fact that "there are many opinionated people here," inferring your surprise over the fact; say it in a nice tone to give them the feeling that you're offering a compliment when in fact you are only envious of their ability to think.  7. Believe things can be "in" or "out" in terms of social popularity, hence helping to make it truth.  8. Base what you perceive to be fact on opinion, not the other way around. If called out on this, say that your perceived fact is actually opinion and deny you ever stated or implied otherwise.  9. If ridiculed for a seemingly annoying action, claim you have a right ("Constitutional" right is even better) to do what you please. Ignore the possibility you are infringing on others rights in the process.  10. If unable to explain a belief you hold or an action you once took, twist the persons words to shift the subject elsewhere. If called out on this, become angered and question the motives of whomever you are speaking to. Say that "everyone is entitled to an opinion" and the person shouldn't try to impose their beliefs on you. Ignore the possibility the refutation of facts may come into play. Claiming this person is an asshole is, as always, a good way out as well.  11. When feeling inclined to comment on a subject others seem to know plenty about but you have little knowledge on, use some popular catchphrase, quote, or clich&eacute; to enter the discussion in pseudo-intellectual fashion.  12. If your errors in grammar, spelling, or any misusage of language are pointed out, ridicule the person as being obnoxious and arrogant for insinuating s/he is smarter than you. Conversely, accuse someone who uses "big" words and proper language usage of "being a smartass" or "trying to act clever."  13. Question where someone got their beliefs or how they formulated them. If they offer a source you don't approve of, tell them not to rely on people who "aren't credible." Never consider someone's opinion they claim is self-formulated.  14. If not knowledgeable or skillful in some area, claim it is "pointless" to be. This effectively offers an escape of criticism while at the same time ridiculing others who have a knowledge or interest in some area.  15. Remember that proving yourself right to the majority is more important than doing so to the person questioning your words or actions. Thus, using meaningless catchphrases can make it look like you came off as the "winner" because simplistic comments will be more appealing to the masses than your counterparts potentially intelligent and thoughtful remarks, which may be too complex for most to process in a short period of time. Perception is more powerful than truth.  16. If all else fails, cry. Sympathy supercedes all else.  17. When being evasive during a conversation or confrontation, attribute your evasiveness to not wanting to waste your time speaking to this person. Remove all doubt about this being a lie by continuing the conversation and continually saying "I don't have time for this."  18. Act like you understood this advice by sending this link to your friends while commenting on how "right" I am.   Thanks  urlLink  Iggy...

      WAY TO GO JOZZY  My mate  urlLink Joz  was  urlLink mentioned  in the New York Times yesterday!   Jocelyn Wang, a 27-year-old marketing manager in Los Angeles, started her blog, a chronicle of whatever happens to pop into her head (www.jozjozjoz.com), 18 months ago as an outlet for boredom.  Now she spends at least four hours a day posting to her blog and reading other blogs. Ms. Wang's online journal is now her life. And the people she has met through the blog are a large part of her core of friends.   "There is no real separation in my life," she said. Like Mr. Wiggins, Ms. Wang blogs while on vacation. She stays on floors at the Hotel Nikko in San Francisco with access to a free Internet connection. ("So I can blog," she explains.) First me in  urlLink The Times , now Joz in The New York Times.  I wonder who's next...?  Way to go girlie!  And yes, they  always  twist your words...

Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements.

And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners.

      From  urlLink BridgettWalther.com    For May 18:  Today&rsquo;s New Moon whips your imagination and high hopes into a frothy lather. Your mind multi-tasks (as usual) pursuing each possible thought to its logical conclusion. Because the real world is rarely able to keep up with your whirligig mental acrobatics, you may feel edgy and impatient with today&rsquo;s pace. You see what is possible, but others seem content with the status quo. You&rsquo;re advised to not come unglued, no matter how sluggish or confused others appear. Today challenges you to carefully control your emotions and impatience in order to effectively nurture nascent ideas and relationships.    Love Meter    Meter Reading : 8  Venus moves retro in your sign on Monday, creating an extra long transit through Gemini. Retrograde periods offer a chance to review, change your mind, or even look up an old paramour that you haven&rsquo;t quite forgotten. Neptune also heads down retro road on Monday, giving you permission to take a trip down memory lane &#8211; not just mentally, either. Consider taking an actual trip to see someone you miss. Nothing is impossible during this extended retro phase. You may find out that a so-called "ex" wants to be back in your life. This may or may not be what you want &#8211; but at least you have the option to explore the possibilities.   Career Meter    Meter Reading : 8  Monday starts a trend that strongly suggests you engage in careful research, instead of jumping to conclusions or accepting another&rsquo;s opinion as gospel. You are the perfect candidate to lead a project to resounding success. You already know this. After Thursday, others will also have to admit that you&rsquo;re the best one for the job.    I always am...;)

      A little girl decided to barf right at the front entrance of my workplace today.  And guess who had to clean it up? Yes, muggings/your's truly.  And thing that got me was this man in the queue kept shouting 'Oh it's smells so bad' and other stuff that I didn't really want to hear, so I told him to shut up [very politely I might add].  It turns out it was his kid that had puked.  If I'd have known that, I'd have made him clean it up.  Flipping typical....

AIR ELEMENT Aquarius,  Gemini,  Libra  *****************************************************************  You're likely to spend much of your day communicating with others - long telephone calls, people you haven't heard from in a while coming out of the woodwork.   I find this very VERY freaky!  I was on a course today and there were  5 people on it that I used to work with at various branches.  I haven't seen or spoken to any of them for about 1-2 years!!  We had ourselves a ball catching up on all the goss.  Must've been very disruptive, but who cares eh..?  We had fun!

        Monthly Horoscope:  From  urlLink Elle.com   For May 2004: You&rsquo;re the expeditor this month, especially during the first week. So much happens between the 1st and the 5th &#8211; enough to rock your world and reinstate your power and authority. If you&rsquo;ve felt a bit like a stranger in a strange land, Jupiter&rsquo;s change of phase will either lead you to the right location or stabilize your circumstances. The 4th offers a dazzling Full Moon/Lunar Eclipse combo that challenges you to take a long, hard look at your career and living arrangements. Are you happy? Are you healthy? This eclipse challenges you to be honest with yourself and have the courage to initiate important changes that may be overdue. Venus and Neptune both go retro, giving you a reprieve from one pressing issue. (A little more time to think and mull over pros and cons is just what you&rsquo;ve needed.) Still, don&rsquo;t procrastinate. Let go of expensive habits or maintenance, gas guzzling vehicles, and other nonessentials that keep you shackled to long hours and money woes. This month reminds you how precious and rare personal freedom is. No  urlLink tchotchke  can compare to freedom and peace of mind. Allow yourself to at least consider a simpler way of living. Mid month brings a cuspal New Moon, hugging Taurus and Gemini. You may recognize that things could be better, but may not yet feel ready to making a change. On the 20th, the transiting Sun moves into your sign, giving you more strength &#8211; and restlessness.   All of this has been going through my mind.  I need out! I WANT OUT! I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done I'm thru.   [recognise the movie quote...?]

        NOT!!    Man, I so wanted to kill everyone today.  Not only did the machines not work [I felt like I was in the Matrix, the machines were turning against me].  So many customers came through the door and everyone as helpless and hopeless as the last.  Boy, why can't people be more autonomous?  Next, they'll be asking me to wipe their arses.  And to top it off, we had a man pushing in the queue, yelling and swearing at me because I said he was not to be served.  When the police eventually came, I never seen anyone more so fast in my life. One minute he was there, next minute he was gone.  Not that the police would have done anything to apprehend him, they're so blase these days...  Maybe I should hire this guy.

       urlLink       urlLink Ronald Reagan has died .  He was 93 - what a great innings!  It's interesting how people are remembering him.  I'm not one for politics, especially American policitics, because I don't live there, but some people  urlLink can't let things lie  can't they?  I just thought it was incredible that an actor got into the White House.  I guess in America, anything is possible.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink My horoscope  for yesterday...    Weekend Update: Friday is overloaded with opportunities and great vibes. Friends, loved ones, creative and social pleasures – and even a touch of rebellious adventure get this weekend off to a good start. Hopefully, you’re not committed to a weekend of work. You’re not in the mood to cope with repetition, annoying people or anything remotely boring. You’re ready for a road trip – something fun and light hearted – perhaps with friends. You’re gabbier than usual and delight in talking up a storm with long lost pals. Most of Friday is superb until late night when a Moon/Saturn square create a temporary wave of worry or sadness. Luckily, it won’t last. Saturday afternoon is so much fun – and packed with variety. It’s your kind of day: an array of disparate things hooked together with fun and a little magic. Later Saturday, you once again experience a moment of fear or worry about the health or happiness of someone you care about. Sunday is physical and fast-paced. If you’re competitive and athletic, you may beat your own previous record. No matter how easy-going you appear to be, a deep vein of do-or-die desire to prevail courses through your veins. Later Sunday evening, your thoughts revolve around love. Some of you may miss your latest crush. Earth to Gem: if you have a cell phone (and I know you do) that’s what it’s for!  We had a good sales day at work and yes, I was chatting away to everyone and anyone, which I always like to do.   And I was worried. Hubby is going away for 2 weeks and I thought he wasn't going until today, but he left yesterday. I didn't see the note he left for me and I was up til 2am, worried sick about where he was.&nbsp; I'm also worried about a relative who is very poorly at the moment. He had an operation on Thursday and has pulled through ok.   And....of course, I'm missing Keanu like crazy.&nbsp; I don't have his number, so can't call him LOL.&nbsp; I so wanna be in America right now :(

        You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Aladdin!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Thanks  urlLink B...
