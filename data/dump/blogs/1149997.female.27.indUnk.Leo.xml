      Whew. Okay, where to begin! First off, I suppose, if anyone knows who the original artist of the image above is or if you are that artist, please, please  please , email me. I found it years ago floating around the web, and can no longer remember where or if there was any contact info. I loved the picture, and it matched a place in my head almost exactly, a spot not far from Kaz's clan that I've written about (though not yet posted, really), called Voice Hill, where one can sit and hear the Arluun sing. I basically only kept it for personal viewing and enjoyment - the colors and artistry are simply gorgeous. I've done something I really don't do here, and that's mess about with manipulating an image. This is the first time I've done it, and likely the last. I would much rather have the artist's permission to display it, and if they would rather I not, all it takes is a letter, and I'll take it down and delete it. I have asked around, but not in the right places it seems, because no one seems to know.       I'll talk a little more later, especially about Further Confusion. For now, I have to head out.

      *sits back down.* Okay. It's always a good thing to go away from a frustrating problem for a while, cool off, and come back with a clear head. So. I've tried that here.        That said, this 'blogger' thing is a suggestion by a friend to help maybe keep those folks who care about this little hidden corner of cyberspace - or even those who happen across it with time to kill and no real interest - up to date on what exactly is going on with the site, myself, and sundry other events which migh be useful to post here. So the sorts of things one might expect to see here can range from explaining what's been added, to why it's still under construction, to what happened to me today, to rants.        Well, it's late right now, and I'm beat from attending Further Confusion 2003. So I'm going to bed. More soon.  Kaz

       Trying this Cafe Press shtuff, mostly for my own use and that of my friends.  urlLink http://www.cafeshops.com/minotaur  seems like a nice little addy to me. *g* Eh. I'll put a link up on the main page when it's all set up. Not gotten everything together yet, as I'm still learning, and much of my already completed artwork which I'd like to do all this stuff with is too small. The lack of scanner means I can't redo the image at a decent size either. The last batch of pics are the only ones saved at a large one, and that through sheer luck because I hadn't deleted them yet. So while I'll be using a couple of the black and whites, I'm also having to recolor the ones I wanted to work with. *rubs eyes* Which at this bigger size is going to take even longer. Oy.   Still trying like hell to get a job. Any job. Even flipping burgers again is palatable at this point. Need -money-. Bills to pay. Bah. The economy really bites right now. On the up side, it's given me the chance to look at going back to school, and get back into writing The Hart, which has languished too long, as well as the short story And I was Cast Towards Home. Maybe more progress will be made on them. Imagine that.  Kaz

       Rarest of the Wild was recommended reading in Elfwood's Woodworks for February 2003 -  urlLink http://www.woodworksezine.com/2003/issue05_feb/columns/reading.html   This is the second work I've had as recomended reading - Minotaur Lullaby made it back in August of 2002, and I must say, I'm rather bemused by it all. Rarest of the Wild is one of my oldest works, and has gone through so many revisions - the latest version of which is now updated in the Wyvern's Library gallery, since I'm looking to perhaps publish it - and yet, whenever I actually get that random email from someone commenting on my writing, it's invariably about Rarest of the Wild. Maybe because out of my longer works, it's actually finished. It has an ending, though the editing never seems to stop. Who knows. It's just another thing that makes me chuckle and scratch my head, though I'm honored that someone recommended me at all. Thanks. :)

       Writing letters is a funny thing. In today's custom of cursory notes and the dreaded shorthand I call hackerspeak - which is the practice of substituting one letter for words, having more than one acronym for several common words in the same sentence, forgetting all capitals and correct punctuation, numbers scattered among letters for no reason whatsoever - as well as brief email messages, what's a letter? An honest to God letter, with a salutation, indentation, formal language... that thing our teachers had to drill into our heads in school, and were so picky about complete sentences and all that other shite... when's the last time you saw one in the electronic medium?       Ah. I'm rambling. Something I tend to do a lot of, unfortunately, but I suppose it's... sort of a way to organize my thoughts. And they need organizing. Heh. Incomplete sentence. Starting with 'and' or 'but' is a no-no. Good thing this is a journal of sorts, because all those rules don't apply. Creative writing has one rule only, but a lot of good suggestions. Someone I admire a great deal taught me that. It was even in school. How about that.       Unfortunately, rambling can also just be my way of stalling. Back to the subject at hand. Letters. I know I write them - oh, initially at least. They often tend to devolve into the barest acknowledgement, a quick few phrases, and a signing off that may or may not include any form of farewell. The only exceptions to this, I've found are friends. The close kind, the deep sort. I may not write often, but when I do, it's a letter. This is, of course, excluding the kind where I'm sending a picture or a file and I'm also talking with them directly in a real time chat. Letters don't come when you're handing them something to take a look at and comment on right then and there.         Letters are funny things. Sometimes they flow like snowmelt down a mountain stream, and sometimes they're as hard to compose as fishing that needle from the haystack. I've been trying to write a letter for over a month now. Every time I get about halfway through, something happens. I had started working on it at work. On lunches. Breaks. Then the shit came down there, and it was a struggle to keep my head on straight and calm, and I had no time or freedom to finish it. Things coalesced there, and when I quit, I thought I had printed out everything of mine to take away, so I deleted it all. I evidently hadn't printed that. Gone. I wrote one by hand, to be included in a package I was mailing. That one's been lost, whether among the paper chaos on my desk or on the journey, either way it doesn't matter. When I found this out, I started to write it again. Halfway through the latest version, my computer seized. You guessed it. Gone. Some letters don't want to be written, and some don't want to be read. I'm beginning to think this one is both. Either way though, someone deserves that letter. So I will keep trying despite minotaur's luck.        You'd think after all this I'd have the thing memorized, wouldn't you? Nope. It's different every time. It just seems like it should be that way, you know? A unique effort every time. It may not make sense, but it feels right. Maybe that's why things keep going wrong with the letter. Maybe the letter is wrong, and it won't make it until it's correctly written. *laughs ruefully* No, I don't believe that. Right or wrong, it will be what it will be, and different or not, it always says the same thing.        Well. You'll have to excuse me now. I've a letter to write.  Kaz

      Did a little visible work today:  Added a poem to the regular poetry section. Did away with all the flashing balls I used to use to show sections which had been updated and when, barring the one next to the Voice Hill link on the main page. All updates will be recorded here from now on. If it's been a while (i.e. four months or more) since you were here, look around, and be sure to scroll to the bottom. Some of my updates which aren't recorded here, this being new, are more than just organizational. Added color version of pic already present in Minotaur Pics section. Did a little rearranging of links and polishing of presentation on various existing pages.

      Things going on site-wise: It's mostly behind the scenes right now, with erratic updates and seemingly unconnected changes. I really must finish the Not So Frequently Asked Questions page. Someone kick me to get that done. I hate leaving 'Under Construction' notes on things, which is why I generally don't do it, working on it until it's   done   and then letting it out on the public. But that's going to take a while. Bleh. Trying to get the hang of this thumbnails thing in the Pics section. What doesn't help is my scanner crapped out, and my ancient, P.O.S. computer won't accept any other scanner I've bought/borrowed/begged for. I have to get all my stuff scanned at a print shop. Which costs money. Which I   used    to have.  Things going on moneywise: I'm now unemployed. For a couple weeks. The 14th of January saw me snap and quit my job of two years at the Humane Society of Santa Clara, a job I loved, but with people I grew to... extremely dislike. More on  that  in another rant. I'm still too angry. Those of you waiting on pictures... I'm sorry. You will get them. I just need to pay my bills first.  Things that are good: I attended my first convention of any sort - Further Confusion 2003. I enjoyed myself immensely after I tossed in the towel, and decided to draw a bit in the Creator's lounge. Thanks to  Furlow  and  Kitler  for making me feel welcome, making me laugh, and putting up with a rather lost minotaur. Thanks to  BushyCat  for just including me in the conversation, and thanks to those who asked me to draw in their sketchbooks. I was honored. For all those whom I just snagged a sketchbook and drew in... uh... surprise? Thanks especially go to  Kishma ,  Tanamin  (I love the picture!!), and  Ed Kline , who got me there, put me at ease, and let me mooch off their company. (Waves to Ben) I'd probably have done more mooching, but I figured you already had a much cuter puppy following you around all over. Nevertheless, all of you made my first Con experience a great one. Thank you. It's a much better thing feeling you've got friends there. Aquaintences count!

      Great god-damn. Finally. Whatever bug was there, isn't anymore. I hope. After deleting most of the initial post that wouldn't show up, this thing decided to work. If it was because whoever Blogger employs to fix things like this actually got it to work, then thanks. If it was just the planets finally getting aligned... well... thanks to them too.

       Snarl.    Because of the revamping of whatever code they're using, I can't post a goddamn thing, and it's not like I haven't tried. Supposedly in my last post somewhere there's a symbol or something that is unusual, but hell if I can find it. Been trying to publish the same post for two days now.     Ithne  thing. Yes, for those of you who are scratching your heads, that's a minotaur cussword. No, it isn't the 'f' one.  Kaz

       Employment status: Still 'Un'. Finances: Broker than a busted board. Frustration level: High. No real progress on the site at present, still working on those larger pics so I can use them on the cafe press store, which still isn't open.    Rant deleted. It was about the war and the president and my opinions anyway, so nothing of real great interest or import. Now I'm just trying to get this damn thing to work.  Okay, rant over, because if I go on anymore I'm going to piss  myself  off. Here. Go read this.  urlLink The original pervy hobbit fancier's livejournal.  Laugh yourself silly. Ancestors know I did, and I needed it. The Very Secret Diaries of everyone in The Lord of the Rings movies. There's a link to the 'official' site where all the entries from the Fellowship of the Ring are, and those are what made me chortle. I'd provide a direct link there, but this blogger POS won't let me because there's one little symbol in the url that's outside the norm. *rolls eyes and mutters*    Of course, it's not letting me publish this entry because of something that's supposed to be unusual. "Error 203: Character not allowed. What it means: The blog could not be parsed due to some invalid XML. If you have a blog with posts or a template that has high-ASCII characters, your publishing will stop and produce this error."     That's what it says the really unhelpful help page. I've tried sucking anything remotely 'unusual' out the posts and still can't publish a damn thing.    Kaz

        Cafe Press store update - I only have a few pics large enough to really use - the Sabertoothed dancer is one of them, and I'm working on coloring it for a T-shirt. I wish they had black shirts though. Then it would kick ass, yea verily. And stuff. But man, it's taking forever to color in the large size. Meh. Still working on it. Maybe I should put up some small stuff first. Mugs or mousepads or something.   I am soooo out of shape. This job is a lot more physical than my last one. Lifting dogs, wrangling with them to get their nails, getting chewed on by a cranky old fart of a black lab, cleaning ears, messing with muzzles, big dogs, little dogs, brushing out hair and sharing a tub with the groomer - it's one thing when you're testing for suitability for adoption, and another when it doesn't -matter- if you wouldn't put this dog up or not, whether it's safe to handle or not, because it's already someone's pet, and you have no damn choice. It may be a part time gig, but I'm telling you, I get home and I collapse into bed for a while, dead beat. This is not to say that I hate it, I don't. I do like animals. But I like animals that are nice to me. Don't we all? *chuckles* And I am getting in shape. My upper body and arms don't bother me anymore. It's my legs and my hips that do. Ah well. I imagine that too will go away in time. Meanwhile though, it makes me abso-frickin'-lutely useless for anything else. I'm too tired to go anywhere or do much of anything. Hope I adjust soon. It's a job, and I need it, but I gots no life. And I didn't have much of one -before-.  Kaz

       My cat, Rill, (short for Mithril) is talking to me. This is a nice thing, because - for those of you who've never met her or heard her when talking with me on the phone... which is just about everybody - she trills. Oh, she can and does meow, but for the most part, when greeting or asking for attention or even just feeling social, she does this very pretty little rolling sound. I almost named her Piccolo when I first got her because of it. I have been assured by my best friend that it's "So   cute  !" and that I must record her someday so a tape can be sent. *chuckles* I myself, working in the animal shelter, have only met two or three other trilling cats, and none before then, so they're out there, but it seems as though it's a rare thing.  Why am I rambling on about my cat? You gush when you're relieved and/or happy, and you've been worried/depressed/anxious etc. for too long. Which is how I have been for a while. In a way, it's just as well this blog thing hasn't been working - no news can be good news, and I wouldn't have had anything good to say.  But! I do now. *grins* I have a job, thanks to a very good friend of mine, Troy. I'm now a bather of animals at a veterinary hospital. The pay is lousy, and it's 7 days a week, part time, but it's a -job-. Money. Gainful employment. I'll take it and like it. *laughs* My first day is tomorrow.  So! While I might not have the oodles of free time I used to, I now... actually feel like writing/drawing/working on the pics for the cafe press store again. Progress will be made!   That's all for now.   Kaz

       Been a while, but then, blogger's been having difficulties, the same as me. I've tried posting to this thing on and off in the past few months, either it or my POS computer has a fit. Oy. Not sure I'll keep this thing going... *wrinkles nose* The changes being made don't all suit me. But, in the meantime, let's see if I can't finally get some news up here.  The Cafe Press store has some small items up on it - not sure if I'm going to keep -that- going either, due to some of their policy changes. Still mulling on that matter, but for now, the stuff is there.   Still no effing working scanner. Still bathing dogs... and searching for a full time job in the off time, though that's becoming less and less as the numbers pick up. They assure me summer is hell.   Interesting notes:  Someone has asked my permission to write a sequel of sorts to Rarest of the Wild. After conferring and seeing a sample of their writing, and assured I'll have a large hand in getting the characters and world right, I have agreed, since there's no way I could ever write the sort-of sequel I had had floating around in my head, as I'm a bit burned out on the story, having worked on it too much. The tentative title is Rarest's Child. More on that when there's something to say.  I got a picture of Kaz from Galen Slater, all gussied up and looking sharp. In more ways than one. Armor and pointy things and all around minotaur goodness. The scan's a tad dark and a little blurred, but eh, machines. Go have a look in the art section, under the Pictures by Other Artists heading. Thanks Galen!

       Hey all. Sick right now, got the developments of a summer cold, seems like. A few new tidbits for this neglected website - I have a new poem up in the non-fantasy poetry section,  urlLink Dragonfly.  Watch it - if you're not in the mood to read something depression-inspired, save it for another time, and go look at  urlLink this;  A commission of Kaz by comic-strip artist Joe England of Zebra Girl (appropriate linkage on the page) shows my character in all her one-eyed, furry, minotaurishness.  And looking at that sentence, I'd say it was time for a nap.   Kaz

       Buh. Will the person who requested the picture of the anthro rat character based on their pet, April, please email me? I've tried contacting you, but the SouIlessHeart@aol.com address doesn't seem to work anymore. I have the pencil sketch of your pic done and inked, and now all's left is the scan and color. Which could take a bit, I know, but I still need a place to send it to when it's finished! :) Drop me a line if you can.   Miguel, the person who is writing the sequel to Rarest of the Wild, has both a Wyvern's Library  urlLink gallery , and a contribution to my minotaur poetry section that I forgot to mention here, but has been available on the site for a while now. Go read!

        Mornin'. I just finished watching a friend's presentation on the Posterior Pituitary - done for one of his veterinary classes. I haven't laughed so hard in weeks. *starts snickering just thinking about it* So far, good day. I'm off to work now, but by the by, I've two new fantasy poems up on my Elfwood site that I've not yet posted to my personal one.  urlLink No Tears  and  urlLink New Eyes  Still fiddling with them, so comments are, as always, welcome.

        Bloody hell. If I get one more ninety pound dog that doesn't want to even stand to be lifted into the tub, much less use the stairs, I think I'm going to break my back. Even dogs that should be easy lately have been a bitch to do. And I mean that universally, not just against the actual bitches. *rubs eyes* Add to the fact that work has been pretty busy lately, along with trouble sleeping, and you have one really tired minotaur slogging along.   In depressing news, I finally got a call from the place I interviewed. Took 'em four days longer than they said it would be to call, but I'll give them this, they -did- call. One of the only places I've applied that ever did what they said they would. They called to let me know I didn't get the position. Told you I blew the interview. *snorts* So. Stuck where I am. Coming up on six months I've been working there, and I'm still flat broke, and the place I've been holding my breath for opening has been delayed in construction even longer. How long? Not announced yet. Guess I can exhale, now.   *sighs* I'm so tired. Going to try and sleep some.

       I’ve been thinking today, off and on while washing dogs, and driving, and other moments. And though I didn’t get to post on the day of, due to another very loooong day at work, and a yet-again fritzing computer, well… no one will hold it against me, I trust.  September 11, 2001. Second year since that day, and while I did not watch any of the memorials, did not listen to any of the radio shows, and did not read any of the articles, it was in my thoughts all day. I found myself looking out for cops and firefighters and passing idle ambulances – not to avoid them or a ticket, but so I could smile, wave. I thought about buying donuts and bagels and taking them to the nearest police station. If I’d had the money, I probably would have, but the fact remains that I’m broker than most vinyl records. I settled for having lunch with a friend, and tying new red, white, and blue ribbons on my car antenna, with a black bow at the top. It saddened me to see how quickly they frayed, even in the drive home, and I’m not entirely sure why.   For me, it started as another morning getting ready for work. Mr. B was gone, so I had the place to myself. They were on a trip to China, a vacation. My mother was on the selfsame tour, being an employee of the travel agency who organized it, and working during it. Mr. B has an alarm clock, but it’s set to talk radio, and it goes off early in the morning. It also shuts off automatically though, so when it came on, I felt no need to shut it off, despite the fact that I hate talk radio. I wasn’t awake enough to really care. Just to sort-of listen, sort-of brush my teeth and squint into the mirror.    Now, my mother had made this same trip several times before. All I knew was when they were supposed to get back, having not been particularly interested in what airline, what schedule. From those previous trips, I had a vague idea of the way it was usually scheduled. When the first plane hit, I stopped. It was announced, of course, on the radio, whose voice had been droning in the background and that I’d been ignoring. Maybe it was the tone that caught my attention. Maybe I had just finally started to wake up. I remember sitting there, and listening, even until the second plane struck.   That’s when I became afraid. In all the other trips my mother had worked on, as far as I knew, they had had a layover in New York. That early, of course, the flight number wasn’t released. Did they have a layover this time? What airline were they on? When were they due back exactly? I called my stepfather, Brad. Of course, he didn’t know much more than I did. He was now attached to the phone, though. He told me to go to work. So to work I went. It was not a good day. I remember snapping at someone who wouldn’t leave me alone and only wanted to talk about it, as everyone was talking. At the end of my shift, I went home. My stepfather was strained, my brother was panicked. All we knew by that time was that the country was scrambling, and that it wasn’t my mom’s flight. And yet, they didn’t know about others, either. My mother hadn’t called, and they had no word on her flight. I turned on the television.  It may seem strange, but I hadn’t looked at TV all day. My instinct wasn’t to flick on the set when I heard the news. If it had been, no doubt I would have reacted almost as badly as my brother did. Seeing it for the first time almost hurt. My chest ached so hard I couldn’t believe it. Oddly enough to me now, I didn’t cry until several days later, when on the phone with a friend. Too numb, maybe? I don't know. Maybe it was just finally talking about it. All my words until then had had to do with finding out about my mom and Mr. B, and if they were all right, when they would be home. Seeing the impact... I can't describe what it made me feel. So many things at once. And yet I stayed there, watching, like some deer caught in the gleam of headlights.  My mother and Mr. B had their own adventure, of sorts. They were in the air, and fighter pilots came up to escort them. Their plane's radio wasn't working or something, because they couldn't reply to the jets. Not a good thing at the time. They were escorted, like many many others, to an airport in Canada. They couldn't come home until the borders opened again. But they came home.  The first anniversary of that day, I thought about everyone else. All the people who lost lives, all the ones left behind, and those around me. I sorrowed.  This time, my thoughts were different. I thought about the people who helped, and about the ones who would still help, and about my family. I took joy in still having it whole.  I don’t know if that’s a good thing, or a bad thing.

      *sighs*   Been a hell of a week. On the up side, I did get over being sick a while back. On the down side... had my second interview for the job I was hoping to get. I'm pretty sure I blew it at the end. I kept cool until then and all my nerves showed at once. I'll know for sure next week, sometime. Or if they don't call me at all.   Didn't have much time at all over the long weekend. Not that I ever do, since I work seven days a week, but still. Hell, I didn't even really have the holiday. Though the hospital was closed, I came in to do half the load they'd given me for Tuesday. Eight. That's a full day, all right? I mean, it depends on a lot of things - size and hair of the dog, whether they have a lot of undercoat or not, ease of handling, if the bath is medicated or not... but it comes down on average to an hour per dog. I'm not a professional dog-bather, so I'm sure that there are people out there who are lightning fast and can turn out sixteen dogs in a day, but I'm not one of them. Especially when I have to share the only tub with the groomer, who has her own animals to bathe and prepare. I've cranked out ten dogs in seven hours, and had days where eleven dogs took me ten and a half hours. It all depends. In a normal day I'll have five or so, on a good solid day eight or nine. Ten really pushes it. You know how many I would have had if I hadn't come in on Monday, and done half?  Nineteen .  Nine -fucking- teen . I've told them I just can't do even twelve in one day, and they scheduled nineteen goddamn animals. No, I take it back. They scheduled sixteen. There were three walk-ins that they said 'Sure, we can take them, no problem' to. Obviously, they don't ask me if I can, they just keep saying yes. And then, when I'm almost done... 'Can you do one more?' Twenty. Would have been twenty. And then what happens? They bitch at me for washing animals a day early. I need a new job.   Got a new drawing in the works. A dancing minotaur. I -meant- to begin drawing a minotaur weaving a basket, but I guess my pencil decided to go with an action pose instead. Now, I just need to draw that basket-weaver, and I can go scan a few new pics. If the person who wanted a rat anthro based on their pet April is out there, email me! I need your working email address, because she's inked and done. If you have tried to email me, try again. The rash of virus-laden emails seems to have ebbed in the yahoo address. Hotmail's still swamped.    Other stuff. Been working a bit on my writing, though mostly on editing and such. I realized most of the minotaurs in my stories are mahogany-pelted, which makes sense if you know me, but across the board in stories? ...doesn't work so good. People are getting the characters mixed up despite small differences. So, in   This Stranger, My Friend  , Mikaela's gotten a change of hue. When I'm a bit further along in the rewrites, I'll put them in place of the current ones. Dabbled a bit more on   And I Was Cast Towards Home  . Progress there! Not much... but progress! Am poking at   The Hart   and trying to figure out some revision that's needed there.   That's all for today. I'm done.  Kaz

       I am so tired.   This past week -  and the week before, really - have just been hell. The only good thing is the check should be decent. But I'm going to be too tired to care. I've been too tired to get online and roleplay, all right? That's tired. That's beat-the-crap-out-of weary. It hasn't helped I've still had trouble sleeping, but it all landed on me yesterday after I got home from driving over the hill (an hour both ways) to see my grandmother for her 75th birthday. I enjoyed that, just a couple hours of her and me. Unfortunately, didn't get out of there fast enough, but that's another story. The one where I tell all about how an eleventh hour celebration was thrown together and I'm expected to show up despite the fact that I have unpredictable hours, and am usually very tired, and need to get up again the next morning, because I work seven a week. The one where I go into how I hate being guilt tripped by arguements and expectations when the ones doing it are being pretty damned hypocritical. I hate that more. Also the one where I talk about how one person who was going to attend and I do not speak, and where she goes, I will not, if I know she's going to be there. And the one where I could remark on my extreme dislike for being both humored and lectured like a ten year old. I'm twenty-seven. I have my reasons. Leave it at that, and don't use me to save your muddy face.    But I'm not going to talk about that now. Be thankful. I could go into detail.   So very damned tired. If I get bitched at too much more at work I swear, I think I'm going to finally lose it. Snipe snipe behind the back biting words and false faces. Never good enough, looks like shit, doing it wrong, fuck it all.  Fuck it all.    Named a black kitten Pangur, for the poem Pangur Ban. Nice little kitten, so are the two siblings. Brought in because the shelter was full, supposedly. Can't blame them. About the only thing keeping me calm right now. I'm a sucker for kittens. I go in and hold one, listen to the little buzzpurr, wish I was back doing something that mattered.   Tired.

       Am I real?   I know that seems a silly question. Perhaps I should add to it. Clarify a little. I suppose a more precise question would be: Am I just a reflection of the people and circumstances around me at any one time?   When I was in college, taking a creative writing course, surrounded by writers, I wrote so prolifically. When I went to the Creator's Lounge at Further Confusion and others were there, drawing, talking about drawing, passing reference books, I felt such a charge. It was like we were all feeding off each others' creative energy, and increasing it. I drew some really good pictures, and turned them out, one after the other, inside others' sketchbooks. When I'm with my family at gatherings, and those members that I have a problem with are in absence, I start joking like all my family jokes, puns, zingers, telling stories about this or that... When I roleplay, I often find the quality of my roleplay echoing that of those whom I'm roleplaying with, post length and quality rising or falling. And when I'm at my current job, surrounded by bitches, I get bitchy.    Am I just a reflection? Is there any way to be other than a reflection? I suppose everyone does that, to an extent, altering according to those you're surrounded by, and what circumstances you're in. Can it really be avoided? Everyone has to get along somehow. And short of being utterly alone, you can't avoid being affected by people. It's not always a bad thing either, such as with the drawing, or when I was in band and we put in a soul-lifting performance. And I mean that in terms of music and how it makes me feel to play well, and play well in a group of others also talented. I'm a capable enough tenor sax player, nothing special despite my musical family and background, but I never minded that. I enjoy myself, and every once in a while, I slip free of mediocrity, and shine. Isn't that all any musician could want?  This all makes me wonder though, if I was alone, really alone, no computer, no other people, no phone... would there be anything to me? I can't answer that.   It might not be so bad to be a reflection. I've been happy being so. I think the online contacts I have are all that's saved me, really, prodding my creativity into fits and starts, but at least ensuring it continues. For that I'm grateful. I don't really like the person I seem to be becoming, when I look back on all the things I've spewed in past entries on this weblog. I never intended it to be anything like a journal, you know. I set this up so that I could post what changes I made to the site when I worked on it. Funny, I suppose. Cathartic? Again, I'm not sure.   I need to get back into a group of artists. Of writers, of musicians. Then at least I'd be a happy unreality.  Kaz

      Spin me a new day. Make it shine like gold in the morning. Make it brightly blue in the noon. Stitch it round with white clouds streaming. Wrap it up with red at sunset. Make it cool with blue twilight's coming. Tie a ribbon all spattered with stars. Weave me a new blanket of night.

      Written Monday, delayed from posting until today.    The sunset yesterday... clouds are always interesting after a storm. Sunsets after one can be particularly beautiful. The problem comes when you can't see more than a glimpse.  I had such a glimpse. Driving to a friends house on Sunday evening, as I topped a small rise just before I would have taken the exit ramp, I looked straight ahead. The irregular line of the mountains was black, but a black tinted brown, tinted a rosy darkness with the light that was remaining. The sky was pale blue, and heavy along one side of it were fat and dark grey clouds, already shed of rain and now waiting to be blown elsewhere. But it was not an abrupt demarkation - when the clouds began, they stuttered along the edge of the mountains, dark against the brightness of the sky. And at one point along the meandering line of nearly equal peaks, they formed a cup. A cradle. A hand. Any and all of these, and the sun was nestled down within it, spilling its last light in radiant gold up the sides of the clouds that cradled it, already past the line of the mountains, lost from direct sight. It was one of those moments you wish you had a camera, and lacking a camera, you stop, and watch it, until every last moment of inspiring beauty is wrung from what you see.   But you can't stop when you're driving on city streets. And you can't pull over when you're on the freeway. And it wouldn't matter if you did, because what you can see from one perfect vantage point is blocked by buildings, by overpasses, by power lines and soundwalls from any other angle, from even a few damn feet away. And the roar of cars is constant, the whine of planes, the distant sounds of construction turning a fallow, green-coated hill into flat brown dirt for another apartment complex.   So I have the memory of that incredible sight for a breath, for a heartbeat... and the next thirty minutes trying fruitlessly to see it again.    That was my day. At least there was the moment of beauty. My month. Well. The good news is, my mother's knee surgery went well. She seems to be recovering just fine. She can walk now, albeit she's having to ease back into it and take pain medication. I'm going to visit her tomorrow. She was working off the clock at her job, and tossing some things into the dumpster out back. Well, in trying to make them fit, she slipped and hurt herself quite badly. She was in a wheelchair half the time, on crutches the other, and in quite a bit of pain. She finally had the surgery though, and it wasn't as serious as they'd feared. So that's a good thing. She'll be fine.  My brother. I haven't talked much about him, but then, lately, I hadn't had anything to bitch about other than work. Sorry about all the bitching, by the way. I know it gets tiresome. Still, I think this is the first job I've had that I truly hate, rather than dislike. Anyway.   My brother is a topic far more convoluted and plain messed up than anyone would enjoy reading about. I love him dearly, and he has his shining virtues, and then he has his utterly fucked up priorities. I have at times in my life stood up in his defense, and had to move out before I killed him myself. Maybe I'll talk more about -that- issue later, because I'm going to see my mom tomorrow. As always, it will likely prove... interesting.  Kaz

       All right, some actual site updating-type stuff. I've put up some pics I'd forgotten about that I did in the other pictures sections, and one recent work - about four assorted anthros: .  urlLink A rat,   urlLink a mouse,  a  urlLink winged tiger,  and a  urlLink jackal.   Two new minotaur pics as well. One for   urlLink Galen,  and a  urlLink dancer.  I've put these as well as sketches I've not posted to my site on Elfwood, but currently there's about a two week waiting period for updates to go through, so... eh. I'll let y'all know when it actually happens.  Finally corrected my age on the profile page. Haven't been 25 for a couple years now. -_- Mreh.

      I rise on the highest of concrete skyways,  steel horse ascending into the pale blue. Other racers fall away, and leave me running alone. It quiets, and there is only the silence,  the champing of my metal steed, and me. I can see to the horizon,  I cannot see the stretch of buildings, or the cluster of cars. All I see is sky, and a tide of clouds breaking on mountaintops, brown and gold and dark dark green. I feel the speed at which I climb, and think, in a moment, I almost could fly.

       On Monday morning at work, I slipped on a wet floor. Mondays are always heavy load days. Mondays after a holiday... ew. Twelve dogs to do. And they wouldn't let me wash some of them a day early to try and make it reasonable. We had - yet another - meeting about it. During this meeting, it was established that one, since we had so many boarders getting baths, we wouldn't take any incoming. Since the groomer had, as yet, no grooms, I wouldn't have to share the tub, so I said that with those two conditions in effect, yes, I could probably do twelve. The lead receptionist said she'd call about this Old English Sheepdog, and see if it couldn't be made a groom, since the thing is constantly matted and I said it would take me the longest to do. One dog for the groomer, the rest of the day with the tub to myself, yeah that was still quite workable. Well, they made it a groom, and to my surprise, I was told that three dogs which had been for Monday got transferred officially to Sunday. So that left nine dogs. Still a damn busy day, but not nearly so overwhelming. I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, thanked the receptionists and my supervisor, who'd called the meeting to begin with, when I said I would be doing some dogs early due to sheer numbers.   So, I get the dogs supposed to be done on Sunday done. Come in Monday to get started. It's crazy in the kennels and the animal care people are swamped. They haven't had a chance to get all the dogs into the bathing room. No problem. I start on a couple that were already there, and easy. When they start bringing more in, I help, since a bit of reorganizing was necessary to fit everyone possible in the room. A couple cocker spaniels in one large cage I moved to two individual small ones, so we could fit some of the large dogs in. Well, these two cockers, like most, are insane. They like to dance in their offal. So naturally, the cage needed to be cleaned. Normally, I don't do this, but animal care was so busy, and it hardly kills me to wipe out a cage, (plus I used to do it all the time) I just took out the mat and grabbed the parvosol, spraying down the insides. Noticing there was some crap pawed onto the door, I sprayed that too, then went to snag some paper towels. I didn't notice, however, that a fine mist had fallen when I sprayed the door, making the floor right in front of the kennel barely damp. Still, the bathing room floor can get very slippery when wet, and parvosol seems to be a marvelous lubricant. I walk over, already starting to bend to reach inside, and yup. My legs skidded in opposite directions. The only thing that kept me from falling completely was that one foot hit the nearby corner of the room and twisted, and I yelped as I toppled forward onto the towel nook. Wrenched my hip but good, and my leg wasn't feeling too great either. I managed to get myself straightened out, but remained curled in the nook, riding out the pain, which brought tears to my eyes. First time that's ever happened. I was found there by one of the techs, but by then I could stand, though I wasn't putting any weight on the leg and just wanted to sit for a bit. Which I did, and filled out all the paperwork that goes with an accident. I was limping pretty badly for the rest of the day.   Which was shaping up to be a lot longer. The groomer actually now had four grooms to do - not just one like had been said. Sitting down earlier and filling out the paperwork had put me behind, and I only had three animals done when she came in. And they started taking incoming. In no time at all, it was back up to eleven dogs. Eight and a half hours later, I still have three to do, when I come back from resting my leg in a short break. One of the doctors was bleach mopping the hall, and had just told one of the animal care guys to grab a dry mop, which they'd use to hasten the drying process. "Be careful," she said. "Don't slip, it's wet." So I nod, and turn to step into the kitchen, which is just off the hallway, and has a nonslip mat down on the floor. I was going to wait until the dry mop had been done. I was going to play it safe. There's about two feet of floor between the door I was standing in and the inside of the kitchen. Three of my limping steps. On the second, I slipped again. Banged my already aching hip and leg into the kitchen counter, on which I barely managed to catch myself. Hurt like hell. Again. This time, they brought the chair to me, rather than try and get me to go to it. I sat down for a bit until the worst of the pain faded, but naturally enough, my leg and hip now -really- hurt. I opted to go to the doctor then and there.   Now, it may just be me. But tell me, am I little off here when I think about the situation, and start to get... irked? I was hurt in the morning. I stayed anyhow, knowing it was going to be a crazy day, and that half the people present were sick, or had been sick, and with the workload everyone had that day, going to the doctor immediately meant someone else was going to have to do my job. I could -feel- that this was something I was going to have to stay off of for a couple days. I knew that if I went right away, the doctor would tell me not to go back that day. And if I went against the doctor's recommendation, once given, I wouldn't be eligible for workman's comp. So I tried to put it off, so I could get my job done, as much as I was already hurting. After the second instance, when I went to tell my manager that I was indeed going to the doctor now, she said fine, but gave me this whole spiel about how I should finish the three dogs I had, and when I said no, my leg is really hurting now, she said okay, but that I needed to come in tomorrow, she didn't have the staff to cover me if I was out, etc. I just kind of blinked, sitting in the chair, and said that we'll just have to see what the doctor says. At which point I left for the hospital. Two hours and a few x-rays later, I was told I had pulled muscles and bruised them when I hit the counter, and sure enough, I wasn't to work for two days following, and then, I was to be on light duty through Dec. 8. Meaning small dogs, ones that couldn't yank me around.   Of course, they've given me medium and at least one large dog when I went back. I only did the large one though, because it was an old, thin setter, who is very gentle and obedient, and is too slow to haul on the leash. When the groomer tried to get me to do a husky that I saw yanking one of the techs around, I flat out refused, finished up, and went home.  Oh yeah. Did I mention, the second day I was staying home, I came down with a cold? Throat became so sore, I couldn't sleep. I have slept about two hours per night. That's six hours of sleep in 72 hours. I am dosed on about everything I can get my hands on, and I'm still effing miserable. Can't really think, either. Hell, it took me three days to finish writing this. (Or is it four? Should I count Saturday, even though it's only been Saturday for a few hours?) Hopefully I'll get better soon. I have stuff to write. Stuff to read. Sorry Miguel.   As an addendum, I sounded like my brother yesterday, and got mistaken for a man on the phone today, (or Thursday and Friday, respectively. Bah. It isn't tomorrow for me until I sleep. Mentally I'm still stuck on Wednesday, despite what the date/time clock in the corner is telling me) even though I know I'm better, at least vocally, though obviously, still a couple octaves lower than normal. That's all right. For once, I could hit the low notes on a lot of songs.   Ribbit.   Kaz

       Further Confusion 2004. I managed to go, and I had a great time there. I'm telling you, there is absolutely nothing like being around other artists and writers and such to get the creative juices flowing. My drawing arm is sore, but I don't mind. The only part that makes me go 'awr' is that some of the things I drew in other people's sketchbooks I wanted to keep! But I figure that's the case with everyone. *grins* There were some fantastic costumes there, and I'm all set to try and make one of my own. I wore my minotaur mask a few days, and it was a hit with some people. Even got my picture taken a couple times. How 'bout that? *laughs* I saw another minotaur walking around there - impressive costume, if not exactly how I intend to do mine. Drooled over some cloven hooves on various costumes, stayed up far too late, spent too much money - really, and I only bought three things. A dragonfly (small dragon with butterfly wings you can hang, and that's for my grandmother), a cd of Heather Alexander, whom I listened to in concert, and a couple prints, one of a unicorn anthro by Cara Mitten, and one of a coyote dancer done by Kyoht. Gorgeous, both of them, and I saw so much more artwork I'd kill to even be close to in skill. *sighs wistfully*Not to mention buy.  Even so, I did get a few tips here and there, so hopefully I'll improve a bit. We'll see. I found myself drawing mostly equines, oddly enough. Though since there was a distinct lack of reference materials in the Creator's Lounge this year, I guess that figures. Minotaurs - what I drew second most often, surprise, surprise - are something I am focused on now, but I used to do horses a great deal. They're easy for me to whip out in a decent amount of detail. Well. Easier. I still erase a lot when I'm drawing. I got a couple of sketches from others - and I have a bunch of my own new stuff all done and inked even. It's time for a trip to get them scanned... and I'm out of money to do so. Mreh. It'll be at least 2 weeks before I get paid again, and with the days off I took to go to the con, it'll be an iiiiitty bitty paycheck. I likely won't be able to afford to do so for a while. Which is really frustrating now, since I want to show everyone, and get a few of those finished pics out to whom they belong to. Zarx just needs scanning, Colin! I think you'll be pleased with how he came out. *grins*   I saw Kishma and Tanamin again this year, and their puppy, Buffy, is grown up now, still as cute as ever. Once again, I mooched off their company, got another minotaur pic from Tanamin (Yay!) and generally had a good time listening to stories about other cons, other folks, and even meeting a few that came by to talk to those two. *waves to Ben* Ben showed me some of his awesome costumes, and answered a few of my questions on jaws and how to make them move. Ed Kline was ill, so didn't get to attend. (Hope you're feeling better, Ed.) But that just saved him from having me chatter at him about how I used to watch the old Dungeons and Dragons cartoon, and the little unicorn he came up with was my favorite character. I saw Furlow in the Creator's Lounge, and he's still nuts. Gotta love it.    Other good news. I had an interview for a job at the city shelter which should be opening in a few months, and I feel it went well. They won't be doing callbacks for second interviews for a couple weeks though, so I'm just crossing my fingers. Full time job good. Money, better.   The morning of the interview was also the first day of the con, though there was nothing much going on, really, just opening ceremonies and a social of sorts, and that not until the evening. Even so, the possibility of a new job and knowing that I'd be going to the con made me feel good. I mean, it's kind of hard to tell just how much everyday events and situations weigh you down until for a moment, you've got hope of escaping them. I sang on the way to work. Sang. A snippet of song that I'd heard when I was in college, and along with other such snippets, have stayed with me.   And it's a new day, here comes the morning. It's a fresh start, there's so much to be done. It's a new time,  I feel like singin'. It's a new day, gonna rise like the sun. Gonna rise like the sun...   It may not last long, but by god, I thought my soul had forgotten how to dance. It feels wonderful, like warm sun on your face after a cold wind.    Kaz

       Well. What to do with all this sudden free time. While it away in roleplay online? Tempting. But the forum rp I've tentatively joined doesn't move that fast - and this is a real-time rpers definition of fast, so that means the forum actually moves along at a damn good clip - and I really don't feel like talking that much on irc. Depression does that to you. Hey, I knew there had to be a low coming to correspond with the high I felt at Further Confusion. I just didn't realize it would be  this  low.   But self-pity aside, there's one thing depression and free time is good for. Yes, artistic sort that I strive at being, my creativity ought to spawn forth and bloom on the diet of angst, no? Well, we're going to find out. I've set a goal for myself, at least. Finish all the short stories I've got dangling and have had unfinished forever, rewrite Kaz's bio (because, let's face it, it was written in '97 and was more than a little cheesy), get the pics I've got scanned and out to their owners - old and new alike.  I even did my very first fanart pic a little while ago, of the two minotaurs in the online comic  urlLink Gaming Guardians , Brahma and Angus. It was so nice to stumble on that, and see minotaurs portrayed as something other than evil, other than the lovable brute, and other than stupid... or all three at once. Angus doesn't count, because he's not truly stupid. And I'll bite anyone who calls him that. Himself included. They're characters with more than a little depth to them, thank goodness. A refreshing change of pace.  Personally, I think it's utterly hilarious how similar Kaz is to them. In the big, brown, and longhorned department, anyhow. They're not portrayed in a style I usually like - more humanoid than I make most of my minotaurs, and with those damn rings - but they're handled so well, I hardly notice. It's the characterization that makes them shine.  But! Pain medication's finally kicking in, so perhaps now I'll be able to sleep.    Ja-ola cheslo, claehj nir nahaf.  Sleep well, dream of glory.

       Where to begin. I suppose with the fact that it got waaaay slow at work last month. My check was $120 bucks. No paying bills on that. I hesitate to say anything about it - or did, since I'm finally writing about it now - because so often I've bitched about having too many to do in a day. While I pretty much stand by those comments, I honestly don't mind working steadily on a more reasonable number per day. I had hoped it would pick up and I'd be able to bring home a more decent check the next time. And really, it did. I was looking at a full week, and a busy beginning of the next. At least until Thursday.  What happened then you ask? Well. On Thursday, it was psycho dog day. I started with three dogs. Two Dachshunds and a Bernese Mountain Dog. The Bernese wouldn't quit barking, and the hotdogs were nutty, having to be muzzled for everything from cleaning their ears to actually scrubbing them with the sponge. When I was on my second dachsie, a Jack Russel came in. Mean little bastard. Had to use the muzzle on him to even pick him up and get him in the tub. In any event. All but two of the seven dogs I wound up having had to be muzzled, and none of them would tolerate the drier. Most of them wouldn't even stay still for the washing, climbing the walls. Clipping their nails was even more fun. But they kept coming in, staggered, and then late. I was on my second-to-last dog all day. It was a tad frustrating. Well, honestly, about the fourth dog in, my back started to hurt. It just got worse as the day went on, and when I finished, and went home, it was aching something fierce.  I've been home since then, back killing me too much to do more than sit, try and sleep in a chair, and take loads of aspirin. I finally went to the doctor yesterday. I've pulled some muscles in my back. Got a note to be off work until Thursday, the 26th. Called that information in to work.   Got a call today from the manager, who asked what was going on, I told her, told her about the note. She said all right, but as a matter of fact, I should stay out. Seems they're having to cut hours, for kennel staff and so on, and right now, they don't really have the load to justify a bather, so she'll call me when they need me again.  No, I wasn't fired. Just put on hold. Might as well have been, though, because I'm not getting any money for sitting here waiting for them to call me. Not that I am anyway right now, with my back and all, but still...   *sighs* Minotaur's luck is a hard thing, at times.   Oh, on my breast in days hereafter  Light the earth should lie,   Such weight to bear is now the air,  So heavy hangs the sky.    -- A.E. Houseman.

       Did a few updates in the Pictures section. Mostly stuff I'd forgotten, like the color version of  urlLink Yarra  that's been done forever, just not posted. Also put up a "lost" picture of  urlLink Travesty  done for me by Terri waaay back, and a couple new pictures of Sehran by  urlLink  Johan-mun  and  urlLink Schatten.  Thanks to you both.   I slapped up a few little idle amusements of  urlLink Minotaur Haiku  in the poetry section, and put up the two battle-bred poems,  urlLink No Tears  and what I hope is the final version of  urlLink New Eyes . Tweaked that second line, and have to remember to change it in my Elfwood gallery. Updated the links to Elfwood within my site to reflect the reorganizing that's been done over there.   Nope, still haven't heard from the other job possibilities.

       Finished up a pic that's been needing coloring for a while. Png keeps the quality so much better than jpg. Pity it eats up so much space. I'm not going to be able to display too many. Either that or it's just time to clean all the crap out of my website. Old stuff and unused stuff. Overhaul stuff. I just might, too, if I keep up this pattern of not sleeping. Least it's something to do. Anyhow. For your pleasure,  urlLink a rat anthro in color,  as well as the now  urlLink colored winged anthro tiger.   Also posted,  urlLink minotaur poetry  by Miguel Ettema. Good stuff.

       Right. Well, that went quicker than I thought. New and finished stuff up on elfwood. Forgot to add the updated version of New Eyes, so that's next. Not much else to say right now.

      I am weary of this song. It will not go away. It simply changes, in the details. In the beat of day to day. I am tired of this ache, This persistent haunting tune. Days that pass too slowly, And days that end too soon.  And sleep runs on before me, And I have left the sun behind. All I have is breaking. And all I get is time. Something in me just stopped working. Something in me just won’t care. I’m so tired of being lonely,  But not brave enough to share.  How do I tell them, really? That this is nothing you want to know. That I would rather go on hurting, Than wound another soul. How to tell them all I’m tired, How to refuse the heart in hand. My song of solitude is rising, A solo without the band.  I can feel the warmth it offers, You think it doesn’t tempt? I want to feel it wrap around me. Leave the rain and wet. It’s been a long hard battle. You think I do not fight? I’ve warred every daylight’s dawning. Every descending night.  Inner battles are always the hardest. Inner turmoil always the worst. Some hearts have cores of darkness, And some are just plain cursed.  Fate is nothing more than defeat, I’ll take destiny any day. At least then I have a choice. And it matters what I say.  Another long night waning. Another dawn ahead. Another hour wasted. Another daybreak fled. Sun and moon begin your dance, And I will begin mine. It’s a long long way to fall, And even longer way to climb.

       Didn't sleep again last night, crashed at last around 5 a.m. Who's surprised? Not I. What  is  annoying is that over the past two days I've had three effing nosebleeds. It's either the heat - starting to get warmer here, good old California after all - or the stress. Probably a combination of both. Anyway. I finally finished a short story I've had dangling for  years , and sent it as well as Wake to Dreams and a short story/prologue thing I've got to elfwood. Now it's just a matter of waiting for it to update.   For lack of anything else to do, I've also put them on my site here, though I tend to want to wait until they're a bit more polished before doing so. Eh. I can make changes when I want. Not like I lack the time, anymore. So. On the site, here is  urlLink Wake to Dreams  (which is a first draft, so will be changing in the future), and  urlLink Partnership , and  urlLink A Meeting of Minotaur and Dragon . Yeah, I know, not the most imaginitive title, but the thing is old. Well. Except for the end and some editing throughout. I sent it off to the person who requested it, and hopefully, they'll at least be pleased with it.   Kaz

       It's been a damn long time since I stayed up all night writing. And it's been a damn long time even since then that I've written a short story, much less, all at once. Nevertheless, this is what I have done, and on an all new tale, no less. It's a first draft, and I'm sleep deprived, so I've only stuck it on my seldom used  urlLink livejournal.   Yeah, yeah, I know it's redundant to have this and that - that's why only rough stuff if anything at all goes there, or stuff related to this one LJ community I'm a part of. So why stick the story there? Easy. It's got a place for comments. Go tell me what's wrong with it that I can't see because I've not slept yet. So I can fix it.  Mrrrm. Today. (Well, technically  yesterday ... but I've said before that today doesn't end for me until I've slept.) Today I got some rather nifty minotaur poetry in an email from a friend. If I get permission, I'll stick it up here or on the site in the relevant place. It brightened my day.   For about five minutes.  No fault of the writer or the poetry, mind. It's just I finally got a letter from the city shelter. The official kiss-off form type, not the second interview looking good type.  Which spawned the orgy of writing I have posted. An idea presented by another friend in passing, and a halfway agreement to try and write a short story around a concept by the weekend - likely never to have been finished past a paragraph, honestly, especially with my track record - got the benefit of my sudden depression.  I take it back. Guess angst is great creative fuel. Just add insomnia and viola. My jaw hurts from clenching it all night. I did some drawing too. I'd show you, but still no scanner.  But at least, sore muscles aside, I feel empty now. So. I'm going to bed. To sleep, perchance to dream.     This is for all ill-fated fellows, Unborn and unbegot. For them to read when they're in trouble, and I am not.   -- A.E. Houseman.     Yeah. A.E. Houseman is one of my favorite poets when I'm depressed. How'd ya guess?   Kaz

       Well. Crawling progress made on one short story. Depression just isn't the fuel it used to be, I suppose. But, even at a snail's pace, there is some. With any luck, I'll finish one of the oldest story fragments about the time I get a new job, which will then eat up my time to write.   *snorts* Sorry. Just getting a little snarly. I finally filed for unemployment, something I really rather dislike. I have a job, I should be able to -work-. Well. Not quite, even then. I've been doing better, and today, I went to the bank to depost my last check from the vet hospital, which finally arrived. A whopping $181 bucks with some odd change. It'll pay a couple of the bills, though, so I'm thankful there's any at all. Still, I have more that are due, and not enough money. Then, I started doing a few minor things around the house that I haven't been up to lately because of my back. Laundry, a little cleaning. That was a mistake. *sighs* Though I felt better, evidently I shouldn't have done it, because after doing a couple things, my back started hurting again. I took some more of the prescription pain pills and sat down in the chair a while. It got better when the medication kicked in, but it's still disheartening. I suppose I shouldn't be impatient and let everything heal, but I've been taking it easy, and I've never had a pulled muscle last this long. *grumbles* Pain in the tail.  I suppose it was a pride issue with the unemployment. It feels to me like a failure though, being unable to support myself without help. *taps a claw meditatively on the desk* Well. For a protracted period. Short term help I've not liked, but appreciated in the past, and I pay back my debts first thing when I recover. I  have  tried to get other jobs. The city shelter still hasn't called back, and when I made inquiries, I found out the opening has been pushed back. Again. So they're extending the round of initial interviews. And the other possibility has also not gotten back to me, though I've tried to call. No news after an interview is  not  good news. Mreh. *lashes tail irritably and snatches a book* Maybe some reading will help.   I to my perils  Of cheat and charmer  Came clad in armor  By stars benign.  Hope lies to mortals  And most believe her  But man's deciever  Was never mine.    -- A.E. Houseman.

       The Rundown:     My computer blew up a while ago, rendering me offline without warning. I had no money to get it fixed or pay my bills, and have been anxiously waiting to get my tax refund, as well as trying to get a job and jumping through hoops trying to get unemployment.   The Good News:    I got my tax refund in the mail, and got my computer to a repairshop. It took a bit longer than expected to fix, but I actually ended up getting a pretty good deal out of it, having my windows upgraded from 95 to 98, getting the drive devirused, (without loss of data, yaaaay!) since apparently the stuff I had wasn't doing jack, getting Norton installed, and my cd drive replaced. The repairman also said that my scanner should work now, long as I have the drivers for Windows '98. Which, when I checked the company's site, evidently I have to buy. *growls and mutters* So it's set up, and I'm waiting on the drivers from the company to get here, so I can use my scanner. I hope. I hope I hope I hope.   The Bad News:    ... eh, I'll write it later. Still a bit pissy about it all, truth be told. *heads off to finish housework.*

       Site Update:    Well, it appears blogger has some new options and such. I've spent probably about seven hours tinkering with the code and such to get it to approximately what I want it to look like, the result of which you should be viewing now. Yes, it took me that long to figure out all the little changes from the given template. I only know very basic html, gimme a break. I had to do a lot of trial and error just to see what line of code affected what, and how. Just like when anything changes, some things I like, some things I don't, but I'd say overall, it was a good thing. We'll see.  Evidently you can comment on this thing now - sort of like livejournal. I'm not sure I'll leave that enabled, honestly. Not like I'll have a lot of dialogue, and really, that might be a good thing, preserving the illusion that only a few people actually look at what I spew onto this screen. People talking back? Scary. Also, I have no idea why the tables are wonky when you go to view the archives. And I don't know how to fix it. Mreh.   Personal Update:    US soldiers abusing prisoners. Islamic fanatics torturously beheading an innocent man. Shock jocks broadcasting the audio to that torment with a laugh track. A President spouting more religious rhetoric and starting to sound dangerously like the people he condemns. The myriad rapes and murders and beatings and abuses commited every day in every country.     WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH PEOPLE?!     ...One state finally taking a decisive step and letting gay couples marry, rather than just toeing the line and saying for these few days, we'll issue licenses. One tiny spark of advancement in the conflagration of the human condition. I'm not gay, can't say I know many people personally who are. But about damn time. If they can be happy together, be so. God knows there certainly isn't much else in the world right now to make one smile.

       Site Update:  Not much done site-wise. Still editing the rough draft of  urlLink Wake to Dreams  and the most recent version is on the site, rather than in the livejournal. Not that there are huge changes, it's small stuff at the moment like reworking sentence structure or smoothing out awkward phrasing. Trying to, anyhow. I've gotten little feedback on it. But it progresses. I think.   Personal Update:   I wouldn't say the computer is fixed, entirely. The fans - which I said needed to be replaced, but wasn't believed about - are making godawful noises and threatening to stop. The scanner still doesn't work. Dammit. But the computer is functional, and really, before I got my hopes up, that's all I wanted to begin with.   Broke again. Can't seem to get through to the damn EDD about my unemployment. Going to cash in what's left of my bonds - which had been intended for my college education, once upon a time - to try and pay some of my bills. No calls from any of the places I've applied.   New email. Hotmail's been getting on my last nerve lately, and I've had to go gradually from one email to up to three. Kind of grates. So I'm trying this new service that has a gigabyte of storage space, and you need to sign in once every nine months rather than ninety days. Update your lists, if you read this and email me at all. It's now   Minotaur@gmail.com   and I'll be trying to get out email notifications soon as well.   I don't know whether I'm numb or if it's gotten so bad that I don't feel anymore. Shutting down wasn't something I wanted to do. I've either been expecting it or... I don't know. I have to move. I can't stay here any longer, and it's no fault of Mr.B, I know he hated telling me. What I hate... and what actually made me cry a bit - in private - was the fact that I've disappointed yet another member of my family. And Mr. B is family, no matter the lack of blood relation. I hate crying. I've been unable to pay the rent for a while now - not that he's been bothering me about it at all. It's just a fact. I have until August to leave - not like I'll be on the street tomorrow. Not entirely sure of where I'll go, but I'm going to have to go. Call my aunt, maybe, get her to help me with the stuff I have in storage. I'll sell most of it, likely. Not like I needed it to live before this point. Need to figure something out, though. I can't leave my cat here, nor my dog with my folks. I need to make some money fast, get enough to rent a truck or something, though what I'll do with my car if I'm driving a moving truck... car. Sell the car, maybe. One way ticket, after all. Get a job in the new location, take the bus like I had to before getting the car. It can be done. I've done it before. Anyway. I'm heading off. Take care, all. Might not be hearing from me for a while.   Kaz

       I hate being right all the time about some things. More, I hate it when I know I'm right, and I think "Maybe this time, I'm wrong. Maybe this time, I should give things a chance to prove me so."    I know better. I ought to know better. I should take my own advice, really.    *sigh* I'll rewrite that update later, folks. For now, I'm going to do some drawing.

      Right. Had a great big update, about six -large-, and long paragraphs, at least. Tried to publish. Blogger said my session timed out. I couldn't get my browser to go back so I could save it, blogger just kept giving me the sign-in screen.   I am really, -really-, REALLY pissed off now.   I dunno if I'll rewrite the goddamned thing. Maybe later.

      Site Update: Elfwood has published my new work, and though I know anyone who's here has seen it before, there is one sketch, the asiatic buffalo I've been sloooowly working on for my Minotaurs of the World series, that isn't on my site or linked to here. So take a look if you like. Comment if you want. Also, I now have a  urlLink Deviant Art  site. Pretty redundant, I know, but I figured if I had to become a member to comment on a few -other- artists, I might as well use the space they're throwing at me. What the hell, y'know? I suppose I'll add links in the appropriate places on my homepage and here when I get the time again. Actually getting forty hours this week starting tomorrow. Woohoo! Oh wait, that means no free time and staying over at my parents' house again. In proximity to my brother. ...damn.

       White Deer Way  The road to Mount Madonna is long and winding.  A two lane highway that wends past field and fence.  Once I break free from 101’s four wide rivers,  and the rustling eucalyptus wraps me in its scent,  then the open hills of horse farms close around me.  And the rows of vineyards ramble side to side.  I can dream again as life seems to find some ease,  and I'm on the way to where the white deer hide.   I drive on Mount Madonna mornings in the springtime.  When the sun plays catch as can past branch and leaves.  Where white stags joust and call their names in misty tones,  and wildflowers can be tasted on the cool, early breeze.  The peak of Mount Madonna in the hazy morning sun,  is wrapped alone in clouds seen as downy white.  A light rain falls only there, even as the fog is on the run,  the sloping flanks already warm with a clear sky's light.   I watch the variety of Mount Madonna mornings in the summer,  from behind the wheel of my car as I drive on by.  From when fog holds you close in blinding, soft, grey arms,  to when gold dapples earth and emerald gleams against azure sky.  Redwood and oak are the forest's crowning glory,  revealed in stages as mist takes turns hovering high and low.  And I remember why it is I love my homeland once again,  as just a little of the California beauty moves me so.   I look forward to Mount Madonna autumn,  when the leaves and acorns will fall in browning spray.  The park is the mountain’s heart, the white deer its spirit.  Cloud-pale stags and hinds dance the ancient, fallow way.  I will bring them wild acorns and the grass that they can’t reach.  I will admire the stags for power and fawns for youth.  I will feel the noses of the hinds soft as silk against my palm,  And in their boundless eyes try to read my truth.   I know that Mount Madonna can be dangerous in the winter,  when the wind and storm and rain all come to play.  The twisting road remembers a time before its paving,  and the mountain recalls its wilder bygone days.  The white deer can be as fractious as the season.  As dangerous with hoof and antler as a gale.  Remember that their taming is as passing as the moon,  which ambles freely among the stars, to sing the tale.

       Brief update here. Mr. B got a new computer, and after much sweating and swearing and rearranging, I have it hooked up and such. I had taken the precaution of putting the necessities on a few floppies, so that I could transfer much of the stuff I needed or might want within the next month, and still keep it off the new comp. But... the new comp doesn't have an A: drive. -_- So I'm installing some of my stuff along with the stuff Mr. B wants, and I'll be functioning again. Sort of... it just means now I have to get used to this too, now, using unfamiliar programs as I am to try and do what I need. I suppose it's good practice, for when I'll finally get my own new computer... about ten years from now. Mrrf.   Site Update:  New pic of  urlLink Kaz  by someone better than me at drawing! Much better. *beams* Thanks Sage!

       Lots to talk about this time. Mr.B has gotten a new computer, so I had to hurry up and get my pics scanned and cleaned and colored, because mine will be moving out, and his will be getting hooked up. So of course, access to all my stuff will be inaccessable to me, though I'll still be able to put the basic necessecities on his machine until I move out. Besides, it was past time to get the pics out to their owners. Even so, if anyone wonders why I don't scan in my stuff&nbsp;more&nbsp;often? Let me give you&nbsp;the total of what it cost me this time. I'm not kidding when I say it&nbsp;costs me money to scan pics. Kinko's charges 40 cents per minute to use the computer with the scanner. I had roughly 30 pics to scan, some twice, because I was going to color a few or try to, and I had to scan the unshaded versions first, shade it, then rescan. Add to&nbsp;that, I had to resize all the pics to fit on a few disks, and flip them because the way the scanner was positioned meant I had to scan them all in upside down - sketchbook, y'know&nbsp;- &nbsp;it wound up taking a bit over two&nbsp;hours. That time cost me $10 to leave my car in the parking garage, because there was absolutely no parking in the street. Total cost of scanning pics? $64.40. Ouch. I hadn't meant to stay that long. It was partly my own fault for losing track of time and just working on through. But there it is.  Move-out date: Has changed. Evidently I was mistaken, and in restrospect I'm not surprised. When I thought he said I had to be out by August 1st, he'd actually said the 31st. So I've got another month to go, and a good thing, considering the EDD is dragging their feet, my former employer VCA is trying to claim I voluntarily quit, and I've only managed to save about $500 total for the move as of yet, though now I'm at least debt-free.&nbsp; Still don't know where I'll be moving to, Watsonville, CA or Oklahoma.  &nbsp;    Site Update:  Changed the page for pictures done of Kaz and some of my other characters by other artists to have thumbnails, and added two pictures by Tanamin and AceXCat, as well as a lost little pic of Kaz as a plushy. Go  urlLink here &nbsp;to see.   Added new pictures to the  urlLink Other Pics  page, including fanart for Unicornography, a giraffe anthro, a fox anthro, and a picture of Travesty, my homicidal battle-bred character.   Added a whopping 15 pictures to the  urlLink Minotaur Pics  section, including  urlLink fanart  for Gaming Guardians, a gift for  urlLink Brahma , a gift for  urlLink Fluri-Mouse , requests for characters from the players of  urlLink Zarx  and&nbsp; urlLink Sasha , as well as&nbsp;pic of  urlLink me  from Further Confusion.&nbsp;   There are frivolous bits of fun like the color version of a young  urlLink Asterion , a sketch requested of an  urlLink impossibility , a  urlLink metal minotaur , and two random  urlLink minotaurs  looking cool.   There are also some more personal pictures, of me. I rarely draw Kaz for the simple reason that I have a hard time drawing the same thing twice. Actually, I can't do it at all, and when striving for character consistency, that really bites. This has been a rough enough time though, that I've actually on occasion over the past months, done what so many do, and vent through the pencil. Therefore, I also present  urlLink Kaz1 ,  urlLink Kaz2 ,  urlLink Kaz3 ,  urlLink Kaz4 , and  urlLink Kaz5 .      No, I've not been a happy minotaur.

       I'm away from home, at the moment. Or, well... I suppose depending on how you'd look at it, perhaps I'd be home. I'm over at my parents' house. They've been gone for the weekend, and got home just to go again in an overnight trip to Fresno, this time taking my brother with them, to do something or other at the college. Ah, yes. My brother, E.J., is heading off to Fresno State soon. I took the opportunity to sleep at the house since it's a half-hour closer to work. It saved me a little gas, at least. I had intended to go home tonight, but they asked me to stay and feed the animals. And bribed me with twenty bucks. So I agreed to stay another night. I would have without the offer of money, but let's face it, I need the twenty bucks, and being able to raid the fridge instead of buying food also has perks.   My brother and I can be like ships passing in the night, almost, barely saying greetings to each other. He gets me minotaur Magic cards, knowing I only want them for the art and will never learn to play, and I... well. I'm not sure what he gets out of associating with me, honestly. It's not like he particularly cares about the drawings that I show him, and we don't speak, really. Which is probably just as well. We're both too much like our father in different ways. No wonder all three of us really get on each others' nerves. I have no doubt that we all love each other, but I don't think we like each other very much.   Funny... in the strange sense, I mean. I found out E.J. has a livejournal, by accident really. Using my stepfather's computer to check my email and such, I ran across it when I meant to go to my own livejournal page to check on that story I have posted. It popped up as his, since he was logged in. No, I'm not going to give a link and subject you to it. He's 18. You just really don't want to go there. It makes me morbidly curious as to whether or not I was that angsty when I was his age. I don't  think  so, but one can never be sure without standing in someone else's place. He's got more to angst over, anyhow, simply because unlike me, he got interested in the opposite sex rather early. Also unlike me, he's a people person. He has many more friends than I ever did, and tends to, if not lead, than at least be right up there in front, involved where I only tended to participate merely because the momentum carried me along. If that. I am of the firm opinion that we were born in the wrong months. He was supposed to be the Leo, and I the Taurus. Not that I seriously believe in astrology, mind you, especially since I'm no leader and I don't  like  the spotlight, which Leos are supposed to crave. And come on, what self-respecting minotaur doesn't want to be a Taurus? ;)  I suppose I'm feeling... regretful. I wanted to be somewhere else, doing something else, by this point in my life. And I don't really have anything to show for it, for doing what I did instead of going to a four year, getting a degree. I wanted to be a veterinarian. Now I wonder if sometime I'll manage to squeeze in the few years needed to become a registered tech, work full time, and still be able to somewhat pursue artistic and literary endeavors. So far, just keeping a job and a place has proven beyond my capabilities. Doubts. I don't know if I'll ever be able to do what I wanted. If I'll ever graduate from college, and be the first woman in my family to do so. I never spoke about it, but that meant a lot to me.   Mreh. I know folks will roll their eyes, and snort, and call me a puppy - which I loathe - but I feel... old. I'll be twenty-eight this year. Two more until 30. Given that anything after 60 - if I make it that far - is probably not going to be all that enjoyable as the old body starts to give out, that's half my life frittered away, and nothing accomplished. There are better artists, there are better writers. Much better.   But I'd better stop, before I  really  get maudlin and melancholy.

       All right, here we go. Let's see if I can actually recall what I wrote before, though it might seem a little incongruent in spots. My mood has plummeted from where it was when I wrote the original version. There's also a bit more new stuff, since the first draft.   It always surprises me to find people that read what I spill out onto these virtual pages. I know perhaps three people that do so, and I'm always astonished to find out that there just might be others out there taking a look. I'm even more surprised when someone I hadn't known read it nudges me for an update when I haven't posted anything for a while. I tend to do things in spurts; writing, drawing, checking webcomics, updating my own site, catching up with the webpages of other people... a bad habit, really. You can bet I'm kicking myself, since after going through the latest round of catch-up, I've found I've missed the posting of some information I was drooling over and waiting for with anticipation, as well as the chance to win a picture drawn by the inestimable  urlLink Kishma  by not checking more regularly. I'm going to have to remedy that.  Yes, I am employed, which is a good thing. No matter what, it feels good to be working, and I've been paying off my debts, which is a great relief. I really hate owing people. My only consolation is that I always pay them back, though it might take a little time. Even so, the fact that I ended up -owing- in the first place... well... *sighs*   Anyhow. I'm working at Kmart. Hey, I said that the fact I was working was a good thing, not necessarily the job I was doing. I'm a door monitor of sorts. If the alarm goes off, it's my job to find out why, what set it off, and deactivate the tag on merchandise if it was somehow forgotten or missed (which most of the time, is exactly the case), or, if someone is trying to rip off something, stop them, of course. I check receipts too, and some people really, really don't like that. I'm always polite, of course, but yeesh, some folks take it personally. It's not even because of the people I ask, either, though that seems the common belief. I'm supposed to ask to see the receipt if they came from an area other than the checkouts, (meaning they usually paid at one of the other ones in the store, like in electronics or the garden shop) or if it's a large item, or something from electronics, or something you can open and put stuff in. So I stand in one place for eight hours, basically hoping the alarm goes off so I have something to do other than think about my aching feet. Is it just me, or do I keep getting jobs that are worse and worse, and pay less and less? Seven and a quarter an hour. That's what I make. With gas as high as it is, as you can imagine, the hour commute each way takes a nice big chunk out of it. Oh, I have actually caught people trying to steal stuff. Busted one woman for trying to get out of the store with over $130 worth of jeans (that's six)hidden in a plastic bin she'd bought. I found three such bins stuffed with clothes, shoes, electronics, and assorted odd stuff - like hair gel - hidden behind the garden shop. Probably a thousand dollars worth of stuff, easily. Inside job, that. But I dunno what came of it. It got handed to the higher ups to investigate. And of course, some I don't catch. I had a runner the other day. Fast sonuva... he got away, I don't know with what, and I never saw his face. S'how it goes, I guess.  Still fighting every step of the way with the EDD for money. Now they're claiming I quit a job I worked with some company called Vicar Operations or some such. The only problem is, I never worked there, and certainly never quit. So while I'm arguing this, of course, my money is held up. Money I -need- so I can get a move on... well, on my moving plans. No pun intended.   I have to get out of here by August 1st. The problem, all the way, has been the pet situation. Nobody effin' lets you have big dogs. I've narrowed it down to two possibilities. I'll either be getting a roomie in Watsonville, where I work, in some low-income housing, (provided they allow a cat and a dog that's over 60 pounds, which is evidently like asking someone for their firstborn) or I'll be moving to Oklahoma. The minimum wage is about the same as I'm making now, and the cost of living is much lower. I could afford to live on a similar salary.   I've begun my packing, at least.
