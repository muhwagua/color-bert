      The wretched squatter is leaving today! Yippee!  I also learned today, from several people, that despite what I would normally think,  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  is a good band and they are very fun to dance to.  I will have to look into this for myself.  I know that they have a video…however, I can’t really say that I have ever watched it.  I get mad when I watch videos…Unless Usher is in them.  He has a strange effect on me.  And I am still worried that Modest Mouse is becoming a household name.  When that happens, the music inevitably changes.  Then what?!

      Today is one of those days when your body gets up and does the normal “morning things” to prepare for another long, monotonous day at the office, but your mind seems to stay somewhere between “sleep” and ”coma”.  I am drinking enough coffee that they might as well hook me up with an IV and just pump it in that way.  Nothing.  I am no more alert than I was at 5:45 this morning when my alarm went off.  You know the feeling.  Your eyes squinting almost painfully as you fumble around trying to find the button that makes the terrible beeping stop.  Your body lifelessly denies the movement that will shortly come, the unsettling idea of pushing itself out of a bed of warm, fluffy cloudlike pillows… My mind hasn’t quite left that part of the day.  The worst part of the day.  Waking up.  Normally, by this time, I am, at the very least, coherent.  I haven’t been able to follow a single conversation today.  People have stopped talking to me.  Don’t get me wrong, this is not a bad thing. I have to wonder though, have they picked up on the fact that I am just going through the motions and doing the classic “smile and nod” routine? Or do I just have an irritated scowl on my face? Either way, silence is golden.    I really am kind of worried though…I don’t remember ever feeling like this unless I had taken something.  Maybe I was drugged.  I don’t know when this would have occurred. Maybe my job is trying to create zombies.  Maybe they are putting sedatives in the coffee.  Ironic.

      Today is stupid.  That is about all I can say.  It is Tuesday.  I was supposed to be at work at 7:30…I slept until 12:30, I was so out of it when I called to tell them that I would be late, that I am not even sure that I said anything along the lines of why.   Why is interesting.  If you ask the people at my job, I had a terrible panic attack and took twice my regular dosage of xanax and was unable to wake up this morning.  In reality, I went to a my favorite bar with this girl that I met a couple of weeks ago, met some guys and hung out until 4am.   Am I insane?  Stupid?  A little slow?  Probably.  I never claim to be very smart.  And really, I could have been having an attack.  Maybe that is what makes me do retarded things like, going to bars on Monday nights.  Maybe that is how I am dealing with my angst. After all, I have been in my house for a total of 2 hours since Friday night.  This week, I would rather be ANYWHERE but at home.  Unless I am sleeping.  My roommate has her boyfriend staying with us.  The horrible part about that is that I can’t freaking stand him.  Not really for any particular reason either. When she met him, he was 26 had no job, no phone, no car, and lived with Mommy.  First of all…why in hell would a gorgeous blonde with a great personality (and a super cool roommate) get involved with a loser like this?!  On top of that, he lived two hours away!  So she drove to see him every weekend!  EVERY weekend!  What kind of self-respecting girl does THAT, I ask you.  The answer, is NONE.  Anyway, I guess I just don’t expect her to be as weak and submissive as she obviously is.  Poor bitch.  Anyway, he has since joined the navy and is now stationed in our town…and squatting in my roommate’s bedroom.  He won’t come out, because he knows I think he is a loser and that I want him out of my house.  He stays in there, pretty much all day, while we are at work, because he has no car, or money, or friends.  Is this pathetic? Or I am just unreasonable and cynical.  Maybe a little bit of both. Anyway, we have a squatter.  It is driving me nuts.  If I wanted to share a one-bathroom apartment with a guy, I would have stayed with my piggish ex and lived a miserable life of putting the toilet seat down and rinsing out the sink after the bastard shaved.  I quit.

      Okay...I started doing this blog thing because my lovely, neurotic, smokin' hot best friend in Kansas City said that I should...and I do everything she says.  Not really.  If I did that, I would have turned out much better.  Point being, this one is for you,  urlLink shuga ... It is raining in Florida, baby, and everything else is the same... I hate rainy days because I feel like I am stuck in my own mind.  The noise is maddening, really...and I hate clouds unless I want them and I really hate the need to carry a huge, awkward umbrella, it makes me wish I was Inspector Gadget...but atleast I had an excuse to go and sit in a coffee shop down the street and look melancholy.

      He stands there punishing me with his  wicked beauty. Heavy stares  shoot arrows my way and I'm sucked in, chained down by thick ropes of  painful anticipation. Narrowed eyes piercing through me, pins against my flesh. I sit wanting him, he can smell it, all the while  toying with me,  teasing me,  I am his prey. I can run,  but I can't hide...

      Well, I successfully pissed my roommate off last night.  As you all know, her boyfriend has all but moved into my apartment and it pisses me the hell off.  But I have been cordial, I have been invisible, I have been all that I can be...(heh heh...) but last night, she caught me off guard and showed up at my favorite bar when I was hanging out with the friends that I enjoy hanging out with BECAUSE they are not stuffed half-way up some one's ass all the time.  I was rude I suppose.  She was there all of 3 seconds and then left. I actually wasn't even rude until AFTER they left...but I guess she read the look on my face when I saw him right on, and just took it upon herself to take the hint.  Probably a good choice.  So anyway, I told her that I leave the apartment to AVOID hanging out with him and then she keeps bringing him to places that I go to escape and that I love her but I don't want to hang out with her boyfriend.  Maybe that is terrible of me...but maybe I am just real...maybe I just don't feel the need to waste all of my energy being nice to him when I have no choice...but I don't want to have to do it when I am away from the situation TO BE away from the situation.  Ohhh...It sucks that I am so blunt...and it sucks more that I am more blunt when I have had a few beers.  I don't hold back...what can I say....

      Lately, I keep thinking about how different everything could have been if I had just listened to my parents and actually attended high school instead of getting high INSTEAD of school.&nbsp; I knew my potential but chose to ignore it to become a substance abusive, black sheep.&nbsp; The one thing that kept me free was my blatant disregard for authority.&nbsp; And now…. I just wish I could go back to ninth grade and not change everything…but change a lot.&nbsp;  I would take back the acid and the speed but not the listening to The Cure in the dark before I went to sleep every night.&nbsp; I would have never started smoking but I would have still sported my JNCO’s and cute little girly tank tops and adidas.&nbsp; I would have paid more attention to what my elders were actually saying and stopped thinking that they were trying to brainwash me into being the conformist assholes that I thought they were.&nbsp;  I look back at all the angst that I had.&nbsp; All the anger that I felt.&nbsp; People didn’t understand our music, our feelings, our style and they judged us solely on all of those things and wondered why we were so angry. Who wouldn’t be angry?&nbsp; I am still angry, just to a lesser degree.&nbsp;  I look around now, and I wonder what these kids are doing?&nbsp; The little girls are prancing around in half-shirts, mini-skirts, and heels at age 9 and somehow, to parents, this is better than her dying her hair purple just to say FUCK YOU to the people who want to judge her.&nbsp; Instead, they would rather her look like Britney and be a wholesome, all-american slut, than an expressive and very real person who has her own style and opinion.&nbsp; This is exactly what fuels my anger now.&nbsp;  I mourn for the days when, through all of our baggy clothes and spiked up, multi-colored hair, we were saying, “HEY! Look at me! I am a fucking person and I will not be ignored!” Instead of, “HEY! Look at me! I am destined to become the worst kind of person! One that bases everything on the approval of the herd!” My message to these kids…STAND FOR SOMETHING.&nbsp; Even if it is just what you like, even if you just want to be noticed, even if you just want to stand for…chocolate ice cream.&nbsp; Fucking do it.

      I decided what the song is that I want to have played at my funeral.&nbsp; This sounds morbid, I know…But the way I look at it is this: I am going to die someday.&nbsp; I want a song played that I feel reflects me.&nbsp; I don’t want my mom to pick it, or my sister, or my friends (no offense guys). I want it to come from me.&nbsp; So, I picked  urlLink one  and it fits perfectly.&nbsp; I want all of you fools to take note, GOT IT?!

      Today I found out that the guy I called the ambulance for last week got arrested the very next day for a DUI.&nbsp; What the hell possesses people to act like morons?!&nbsp; Why would he go and get arrested the DAY after someone had to call an ambulance because he didn’t know his name!?&nbsp; Idiot.&nbsp;   So I am sitting here wondering why there are never any cute boys at the hospital.&nbsp; This is distressing.&nbsp; This is where I spend all of my time.&nbsp; Do me a favor, anyone in my area who reads this blog, if you see a cute boy, hit him with your car.&nbsp; But don’t kill him.&nbsp; Just give him a bruise or something small that will require physical therapy.&nbsp; Thanks.

      Today I accidentally announced to my department that I have accepted a new position.&nbsp; A promotion.&nbsp; Now everyone is making me feel like crap.&nbsp; I found out last week and had kept it quiet because there are a few classes that I will need to take before I am actually going to be doing the job. Today someone that I did tell about it, (I suppose she thought that I had already told everyone) came up to congratulate me.&nbsp; So now, every 5 seconds someone is at my desk telling me how happy they are for me.&nbsp; I am kind of sad actually. I have worked in this department for four years and I have grown really attached to the people here. The doctors that I work for, especially. They really are great. One of them came out of his office, pretended he was sobbing, said, “we try to raise them right, and then they just…grow up and LEAVE US!”, and then called me a bitch in sign language…which is an interesting reaction to say the least.&nbsp; I can’t even imagine what it will be like in two months when I am actually leaving.&nbsp; It makes me sad…but SO happy at the same time.&nbsp; I need out of this job.&nbsp; Bad.&nbsp; But I need a lot of things… &nbsp;I was just sitting next to two old men that volunteer at the hospital I work at.&nbsp; I was eating lunch and eavesdropping on their conversation.&nbsp; One of the men was saying that his grandchildren are coming to visit him and his wife for the first time without their parents.&nbsp; He said he was going to “spoil the hell out of them”.&nbsp; It is so refreshing to hear.&nbsp; Grandparents are so great, I wish I could have mine around all the time.&nbsp; I wish I was still a little kid.&nbsp;

      I had to call 911 twice yesterday.&nbsp; I called once from work.&nbsp; Which happens quite often, because, while I work at a clinic, we don’t have emergency care, so…  Anyway, I went to have dinner with a couple of friends at my favorite beachy outdoor bar/grille…and this weird guy (who was so OBVIOUSLY Navy, you could smell it) comes in alone, pulls out all of the four chairs at the table behind us (as if some people will be joining him), sits down, mutters a few inaudible words, and passes out.&nbsp; Everyone just kind of ignored him until it became obvious that no one was meeting him.&nbsp; He started kind of swaying every once in a while. The kind of swaying that you do when you are sleeping in class and trying to keep your head up and not fall out of your chair.&nbsp; My friends and I were pretty sure that it wouldn’t be long before someone would have to do something.&nbsp; I continued eating dinner…and then there was a thud.&nbsp; When I turned around, he was crawling (I am not even really sure that you could call it crawling, half of his body was crawling, the other half was…being dragged.) to another table where a girl was shooing him away, laughing at him.&nbsp; I started to feel bad.&nbsp; Who was this guy and why had his friends left him in this state to wander around the beach alone?&nbsp; How could they sleep at night? Bastards.&nbsp; Granted, this guy was stupid as hell for getting that lit, but have some fucking compassion!  Anyway, my new friend from my speech class was with me and she ran inside to tell the manager that he MAY want to do something about the drunk guy, as two guys place drunk guy back in the chair he had fallen out of, each take a side, and carry him across the bar, and down three stairs, where they place him on the SIDEWALK.&nbsp; I guess he had started puking at this point. I have no idea.&nbsp; Eventually, they brought him back up onto the deck and set him by the front door where he fell out of his chair, yet again.&nbsp; This time, more people saw it so there was laughing and pointing and just plain ugliness happening.&nbsp; No one helped him get up.&nbsp; No one tried to get help.&nbsp; I got pissed and ran inside to tell the manager that I was calling rescue.&nbsp; At this point, the guy was shaking and sweating and dry heaving and he couldn’t speak.&nbsp; So, we called 911.&nbsp;  They finally came.&nbsp; The guy was in bad shape.&nbsp; Really bad.&nbsp; He didn’t even remember his name.&nbsp; I really hate to see things like that.&nbsp; Especially the assholes who laughed at him.&nbsp; He deserved it to an extent, he did it to himself, but I just…I don’t know…I guess I just care too much about these random people.&nbsp; I guess that is what my job does for me.&nbsp;

      One of my best friends died of a drug overdose almost exactly a year ago today.&nbsp; I woke up thinking about him this morning. I must have dreamed about him. There’s nothing like waking up sad.&nbsp; It is weird how close you can be to someone without even knowing how much they mean to you.&nbsp; Just teaches you that you should never take anyone for granted.&nbsp;  With that said, I guess I should reflect…or not.&nbsp; I don’t really know how to deal with this, even still.&nbsp; It is hard to talk about.&nbsp; Hard to write about.&nbsp; No one can really know what he meant to me and I will never know what I meant to him.&nbsp; It sucks.&nbsp; It sucks that such a brilliant, wonderful person was taken so young.&nbsp;  When I tell people it was an overdose, they automatically assume that he was a long-time user and that he did this sort of thing all the time. People tend not to sympathize because they look down upon the way that he died instead of considering or even caring what kind of person he was.&nbsp; Like his death is somehow cheapened because he wasn’t perfect. But if he were killed by a drunk driver or hit by a bus, saving a child’s life, people would look at it differently. The truth is, he had just moved back from graduating from school and was about to start his career.&nbsp; His life.  He had only been back a few weeks and was hanging out with all of us (the people that he knew best), enjoying being home. And then he was gone.&nbsp; None of his good friends really know what happened.&nbsp; All we know is that he was taking morphine.&nbsp; We know where he got it, and we know where he was, but as far as why, and how much:&nbsp; who knows?&nbsp; He knew about those things. He had taken drugs for many years while he was a teenager, he knew which ones he could handle, which ones he couldn’t.&nbsp; But he rarely touched them anymore.&nbsp; And things were going so well. Until that night.&nbsp; And then it was like “being punched in the chest with a Buick” as Henry Rollins once said.&nbsp;  I grieve every day for Matt.&nbsp; I think about how terrible it must be for his family, having to put their lives back together after he died.&nbsp; I think about how heart wrenching it must have been for Matt’s best friend since he was six to write his obituary. I think about how much he has missed since he has been gone and how much he has been missed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;I guess my point in all of this is that if you are my friend, I love you and want you to know that you are special and appreciated.&nbsp; I don’t know if I say those things enough to the people that I am lucky enough to be surrounded by.&nbsp; I don’t know if you all know how much you mean to me.&nbsp; There you go.&nbsp; Right there, so you can’t say I never told you.

      Is it wrong that I want to hit patients?&nbsp; I realize that these people are sick and everything but I am starving and I have a headache and I am the one who has to deal with THEM when they don’t want to wait for Dr. Slowass who is currently running 5 hours behind schedule.&nbsp; I am the one who has to deal with THEM when some idiot rescheduled their appointment and didn’t tell them.&nbsp; ME.&nbsp; So, I don’t want to hear that they drove 80 miles to get here so that they could have a 30 minute appointment and now it isn’t even scheduled for today.&nbsp; I don’t care if they need to get 75 pages of medical records to Dr. Neurologist. I just want them out of my face!&nbsp; I don’t whine like these people when I go to the doctor! I don’t blame the girl who is covering for the receptionist so that she can eat a damn sandwich!&nbsp; I blame the idiot who screwed me up in the first place, or my dumb memory, or the doctor who doesn’t find my time valuable enough not to waste it!  &nbsp;  That being said, most of the time, I really am very sympathetic to these people.&nbsp; Today is different in several respects.&nbsp; I am bitter because I have no money, I am bitter because it is Friday and I really wish that I could go home and lay in my hammock and sleep in the sun.&nbsp; I am bitter because I haven’t eaten since yesterday and I have a whole hour to wait before I can even think about it.&nbsp; I am bitter because this bitch doctor here just got an attitude with me and she is lucky she wasn’t within my reach…I probably just need to smoke a cigarette and suck it up.&nbsp; But, you know what?&nbsp; No.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was just standing here, trying to work, when this woman comes up and starts playing 20 questions with me.&nbsp; ‘How long is this appointment going to take?’ ‘Will I need to go in with my husband?’ ‘Do you think I could leave and go and run some errands?’ Meanwhile, Dr. Bitch is rolling a patient in a wheelchair up behind me waiting for me to open the door, which I can’t do, because this neurotic patient can’t just wait to SEE how long the appointment will be.&nbsp; So, Dr. Bitch interrupts me, “Can you OPEN the DOOR?” (‘Why, yes I can…and you should probably stay out of the way because it MIGHT hit you in the face.’) and in mid-sentence, I have to walk away from neurotic lady and open the door for Dr. Bitch.&nbsp; Who is looking at me with discontent and rolling her eyes because some of us have manners and we don’t just walk away from someone when they are talking to us.&nbsp; Some of us don’t care that she is a doctor and that she went to school for 75 years to end up to be the most miserable bitch I have ever met.&nbsp; Way to live, I tell you.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I guess I should stop bitching now…I am sure no one cares.&nbsp;

      The beast is back on the road! Poor Fiona had a crack in her radiator. That must have been painful for her. But she is fully recovered and back to being my trusty hunk of metal. Just for those of you who were worried.   I got a call about a new job today. I have been trying to find an acceptable new job for about a year. I have had interview after interview and all I ever come up with is CRAP. I really don’t want to leave the company that I work for because we are world-renowned and all…but I really don’t want to stay at the position that I am in. It is hard work and I have been doing it too long. I just want to get done with school so that I can make REAL money as opposed to this shitty excuse for a paycheck that I am taking home now. Is it so unreasonable to think that I could be hired to do something that might actually pay a decent salary and at the same time, NOT make me hostile and bitter. Nobody wants to be hostile and bitter.   This weekend is the bachelorette party for the wedding that I will be standing in next weekend. I have decided that when I get married, I will pick out the  urlLink ugliest , most expensive freaking dresses that I can find, make these chicks buy them, and hideous shoes to match…ones that will give them all blisters the size of their heads, and then on the day of the wedding, I will announce that THIS wedding was the practice one and those were the practice dresses and then show them the real, even more expensive beautiful gowns that my REAL wedding will require. I think that oughtta teach em.

      There are five pregnant women at work right now. Five. Is this some kind of outbreak?  It scares me.  There is already so much estrogen in my work area, and so much attitude, I can’t even imagine what it will be like with all these new pregnancy hormones floating around.  I already want to beat the hell out of some of the chicks at work and now I really can’t.  Now there will be an explosion of bitchiness.  Fabulous.  I can’t believe it is only Wednesday.  My car broke down yesterday morning, so I am depending on random people to drive me around. Hating itI am such a stubborn bitch and I hate to ask for help from anyone. Apparently, there is a crack in the radiator which, from what I hear, may or may not be under warranty. I wish someone would tell me so that I could stop biting my freaking nails off.  I can’t stop thinking about how I am going to get to work from home and then school from work and then home from school…and then how I will get beer with my whopping $4 balance in the checking account. Because naturally, after thinking about stupid shit like that all day, you need beer.  Lucky for me, I have friends who understand the necessity and don’t hesitate to pick me up and fix my terrible situation, if only temporarily.   In other news, I have just heard the WORST song in the history of bad songs.   urlLink Britney Spears  has truly outdone herself this time.  Let's hope it can't get worse...

      I just need to start by saying. "I do NOT want to fucking go to work tomorrow!" Ahem...  Now that that is said...  Last night, I went to a bar, with a friend of mine, who brought HIS friend...they are both in the Navy and I have met the one guy before, and just remembered him as "the guy with the crazy wife". I won't get into all the things I have seen that gave him and her those names, but just know...she is certifiable.   Anyway, this guy...proceeds to get SHITFACED and we talked about why he won't leave his crazy bitch and all this crap...turns out, he is afraid that he won't find anyone else! He is 24....and that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard...let me just say that I would rather, be single as hell (as I am..) than be miserable and pissed off all the time...am I wrong?  What is wrong with people!?   Later on in the night, (and I am SURE it was the alcohol talking) he told me that I was the girl of his dreams...and a whole bunch of other shit that I won't repeat because it would make him look like a big, sappy jackass...poor guy.  Anyway, things like this make me uncomfortable.  Anyone who knows me knows, that I do NOT show much emotion...and don't get me wrong...there is nothing at all wrong with other people showing it, but guys that get drunk in bars and then ask me why they didn't meet me before they got married, make me want to throw up a little...what can I say?  There is also this girl at this bar, whom I see every time I go there, who calls me "Boo" or "that hot chick"...and it is really strange...I don't know where all of these freaking weirdos are coming from lately...but it scares me...Aliens.

      Well...last night, a friend of mine convinced me to go to a gay bar for her friend's birthday party.  I have been to gay bars before...but I have never been molested sooo many times in my LIFE.  In this situation, you can't really get offended because...you aren't really sure why a guy that looks like he just stepped of the stage at a Village People concert is grabbing your ass.  So, I am thinking, maybe I look like a drag queen?  Maybe they were just confused?  I really hope that is not the case.   Anyway, so I ask my very drunk, very gay friend  urlLink Henry  (who I just happened to run into) just WHY all of this was occurring. "What does this MEAN?" I asked him.  To this, Henry shrugged, and then gave me a look, as if to say, "I am about to fall down" and then started to laugh.  The moral of the story is, drunk people can not supply answers to questions like these. So Brandy calls me today to tell me that she is looking at pictures of me and Henry on the internet.  Interesting.  So, I was intrigued...and I checked it out...and there I am.  Drunk.  And in one of them, Henry actually appears to grabbing my boob! In the words of Brad (another one I met last night)..."We love straight girls!!!"  I also went to a party after the whole gay bar phenomenon.  This party was crawling with people I went to middle school with. Middle school!  People that I did acid with back in the sixties!  I couldn't believe it!  Weirdest night of my life...and it just ended a few hours ago!

      There is a man with no teeth wandering around the halls at my job telling everyone about the time he got shot.  This bothers me.    So…Today I talked with my other half.  Technically, she is someone else’s other half (her husband’s)…but…we are like the same person.  She is pregnant and she lives in Indiana.  (Just for the record, I need to ask, why IS it that all of my best friends except two live in different states?  Are they TRYING to get away?)  Anyway, she is doing really well, it seems.  But I am really kind of upset because I have missed her ENTIRE pregnancy, and that truly sucks!    Tory and I have been friends since we were 15 and she asked me (pointing to my over-sized black tee-shirt with a picture of Jim Morrison on it) if I liked The Doors.  That was it, we were best friends from that moment on.  Somewhere along the line, she got a boyfriend who was the most rotten, hateful, psychotic piece of shit that I had ever met and he hated me even when I was nice and sweet and never said anything mean to him.  So he, along with several other factors, turned us against each other, they broke up, she moved to Indiana, and we lost 3 years of friendship.  We have been friends again for three years…but she lives so far away.  It is really weird to have a friend that is so much a part of you that you feel like you are missing them every minute.  It sounds creepy, I guess, but I remember the three years that we didn’t speak, just being crushed about it.  I couldn’t even talk about her.  And then one day, Brandy and I went to my Mom’s house and there, on the table with my other mail, was an envelope, address in MY handwriting, I thought…return address: Indiana.    Anyway, I have missed the entire thing.  The morning sickness, the weird cravings, the baby shopping and I hate it!  If you asked me a couple of years ago, there is no way that I would have thought I would ever be in her life again anyway, but now…Now I feel like we are wasting time with her living so far away!  I feel like we should constantly be together to make up for all that time we spent bitter and missing each other.  Who knows…  At least we are friends again.  At least I know that she has found someone wonderful and that he loves her ALMOST as much as I do…  AND NO,  urlLink Chris , I am not just saying this because you might read it!

      Today is the first day of class…well, it is actually the second day, I am just a slacker and didn’t go to the first class. I am a career student for this reason and that of procrastination.  I am excellent at both.  I am taking a basic speech class that normal people took when they first entered college. I, on the other hand, waited.  Therefore, making it one of the last classes that I will have to take before getting my lowly Associates Degree.  It is pathetic, I know.  Anyway, I am freaking out…I hate speaking in public.  I don’t even hate it so much as it completely turns me inside out.  I am dreading it.  The laziest woman on the planet happens to work at my job.  Now she is pregnant. I cannot see this as a good thing.  This, to me, seems to be yet another excuse for her to sit, ignoring work, and eating the entire meals that she has stashed in the top drawer of her desk.  Who does that?  Who buys two lunches and puts one in their desk for later?  We are only here for eight hours a day!  Now she will probably have whole Thanksgiving sized meals in there.  I can’t wait.   In other news, best friend and company from Kansas City had a great time from what I can tell, while visiting the Sunshine State.  They got sunburned and turned purple because “sunscreen is for pussies”…however, they were singing a different tune by that evening.  It pays to be responsible and keeps you from looking like Barney too…you can quote me on that.

      Funny how when you don't see someone for a long time and they pop back into your life, it seems like they have never left, but SO much like you have missed something at the same time.   I think that may be the longest sentence ever.

      I am so sick of my life…does anyone ever really get to the point where they are happy where they are?  I can’t see that being an easy task. I remember at one point, wanting to move to Tokyo, learn to speak Japanese and become Buddhist…why didn’t I do that?  Because I am so westernized that I can’t think beyond the material excess that I choose to drown in.  This country, myself included, has no soul.  I need out of the stupid American every day. I need out of the world of Caramel Machiattos and Britney Spears and capitalism…I need to escape from all of it.  I want to bask in the sun.  I want to be free.  I want to stop caring about money. I want to follow my bliss.  Why can’t I do that?  Why don’t I have the balls to take off and fucking GO?  Because I would miss my family?  Yes.  And no.  Because I would miss my job?  No.  Because I have spent so many years of my life trying to become more educated and earn more money and get better things that I have forgotten what it is like to LOVE what you are doing?  Yes.  This is an “A-Ha!” moment.  But will it change my life? Doubtful.   Tomorrow will be like all the rest Smiling when I want to scream Lying to the faces Lying to myself Stuck

      I just got in a rubber band fight, but don’t worry, I am okay, just a little shaken up.  One of the docs just blindsided me and attacked.  He’s the rubber band man, wild as the Taliban.   Tonight will be a night of drinking and singing karaoke with rednecks and trash.  It should be a great time.  A night of unity.  A night where the true meaning of America will prevail.  And I will be there.  Singing “Friends in Low Places” with a bottle of Budweiser in one hand and a cigarette in the other.  Everyone needs to be a redneck every so often.  Tonight is my night to shine.  And I will do it in honor of the late  urlLink Lacy Van Zant.      urlLink Ringo Starr  was in town yesterday, just hanging out! What is up with that?!  No one cares about Ringo, I know…I care, Ringo, I care.   urlLink Brandy  cares too, don't you, Brandy?   This is really unimportant stuff I am talking about here...I should stop...I WILL stop...I will continue to read the newspaper...and I will leave you all alone...

      So…I have been seriously considering moving out of my apartment.  My roommate and I have a difference of opinion in this guy that she is dating being at our apartment all the time.  I just think it is disrespectful of her to have him there constantly.  I have a busy schedule, so I am not there a whole lot, but when I come home from work on the days that I don’t have school, I don’t always want to see him first thing when I walk in the door.  It isn’t that I really don’t like him, I just don’t really care about him one way or the other…but out of courtesy, it would be nice if I had SOME kind of say in how often he is there.  Aside from the fact, that she has admitted that her behavior is selfish.  So, there ya go.  I don’t want to live with him.  And honestly, he is there more than I am…why isn’t HE paying rent?  Why am I not living there for free?  That’s what I want to know.  It may sound harsh…but I have spoken to her and she knows how private a person I am and how important my space is to me, so it should be no shock to her that this is not my ideal situation.  But I don’t fuck around when it comes to my space.  I don’t like it polluted with mooching Navy idiots.  Apparently, that is just me.  I will get the dumbest, most annoying, dirtiest, loudest boyfriend in the world and move him into the apartment…that is what I will do.  I will get started on that right now…  Here I go….

      The phone calls from psycho seem to have completely stopped. I hope that I am not speaking too soon but I didn’t get ANY yesterday! Not even a text message!  It was fantastic.  I did get a drunk phone call from one of my friends from high school who I think, sometimes pretends to be drunker than he is so that he can leave me stupid messages at 4 in the morning and I won’t get mad.  But it does get to be a little odd that he would continue to do it.   I really want to go on strike.  I think that it would really benefit my emotional well-being.  I think that I should just quit everything and live under the pier.  I have been thinking about this a lot over the last few days due to the fact that EVERY single patient that I have had to deal with has been completely brain-dead.  I don’t know how psychos and idiots can seek me out so easily…it is like I am wearing a neon flashing light to attract them.  Seriously.  Yesterday, a simple instruction like “Go to the lab for a blood draw” turned into rocket science.  I swear you would have thought I was trying to explain to this woman how to disassemble a bomb.  And she keeps coming back to torment me.  This morning I told my supervisor that I am buying a tazer. (which, I obviously cannot spell…because this word never looks natural, no matter what letters you use.)  Man…I have 3 months before I start my new job and someone is already trying to get my desk!  Get me OUT of here!

       I take it back...it has been brought to my attention that it is much easier to break someone's arms, than it is to break their legs.  Another good point, breaking their arms impairs their ability to call you on the phone and/or drive over to visit.

       Let me just start by saying that if that fucking crazy married guy calls me one more damn time, I am going to have someone break his legs...and I am SO not kidding.  He keeps calling me and leaving these bizarre whiney messages about how he needs to talk to me.  Why?  What importance do I have in his pathetic little life?  He has called about 75 times this weekend...and not once, out of all of those, have I answered the phone or the 3,000 text messages.  My drunk roommate did answer last night when I left my phone at home when I went to the store.  She apparently told him, "I don't know YOU, she doesn't want to go anywhere with YOU...and she isn't even HERE." and then she hung up...I love her, she is a trip!

       A Short/Infinite Story  There exists a young man named Billy, and he enjoys smoking marijuana.  He is usually not the type to get paranoid, but on this particular evening he is experiencing a very paranoid high.  He is also experiencing the "munchies."  He decides to go to the local Taco Bell, to get a Number Two Combo Meal with a Dr. Pepper.  He pulls up to the drive thru window at approximately 11:23 pm on this crisp October evening.  He wonders what the drive thru worker, being an African American, will think about the fact that he is listening to Tupac on his car stereo.  Will he think he is some white asshole who listens to hip-hop but doesn't really "get" it?  Will he think that he is a cool white guy who is "in the know" when it comes to the hip-hop?  Maybe he is the high brow type black guy, who likes Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker, and then will surely look down upon his Tupac (may he rest in peace).  As he rounds the corner and gently hands over his $5.58, the African American drive thru worker does not appear to notice the music playing from Billy's car stereo.  Instead he is eyeing the champagne-colored Lexus parked in front of the Taco Bell that is his mode of transportation.  He parks the car directly in front of the Taco Bell because the fast food establishment is located in a minority district in which many burglaries and other crimes occur and he is afraid it will get stolen.  This would be a shame indeed, because he has no car insurance and will be paying for this vehicle for at least ten years of his life. He hands Billy his meal and Billy drives around the corner, being careful not to hit the Lexus parked in front.  At this point Billy notices two cop cars pulled over on the side of the road across the street and immediately his thoughts are on the quarter of an ounce of marijuana in his left pants pocket.  He drives by the police cars, paranoid as hell, but the cops do not seem to notice him, and are off duty anyway.  In fact, they are secretly involved in a romantic affair and are taking this opportunity to "be intimate" before they go home to their spouses.  Billy's car hesitates slightly while passing by and the lovers are momentarily alarmed.  However, at this point Billy is well on his way back home, and soon they are relieved. Billy is no longer paranoid about the cops, but rather the fact that it seems as if it is taking him a  really long time to get home .  What if he is stuck in this car on this road forever? What if this road is the only thing that exists in the world and he is held captive by its yellow and white lines forever?  Billy begins to sing a song in his head to take his mind off of this metaphysical mindfuck.  He sings it all the way home, never making a sound.

       Klepto   I like seeing you everyday.  A child's curiousity peering into your adult eyes I steal small things so no one will notice. I know they are watching me anyway.  Do you see?  Do you see my sticky fingers and my deep breaths? My moment glances? In secret places I hide it all away, Later in the dark I take it all out and my face glows.  I wake up and wonder what secrets you know.

       Lonely Smoker   No one understands its an art. She sighs. Pulls the glowing red fireball away from her mouth and exhales a puff of powdery gray air, marking her territory.  No one invades her space. Legs crossed. Face scowling.  Painting her lungs black as night; If only she could see her progress.  "This cancer," she whispers, "Its not contagious. Its mine to keep for myself."  While she's never been diagnosed, She feels this cancer growing inside her, like a fetus, and she feeds it. Wraps her lips around the paper phallus, Shows the world the beauty of self destruction.

      (another of my attempts at sounding like a Beat Poet.)   You can't make it all stop by ignoring your mail letters left unopened messages on the machine blinking dazedly...  dust on the TV smoke in your lungs Just because you stare at the ground, it doesn't mean you're an atheist.  The music doesn't kill the silence. The cancer won't kill your soul.  Open a book- educate yourself, for Christ's sake. for Buddha's sake, for the Krishna's, for your mom.  Go outside and shiver in the cold air Breath in/out. Quick-check your heart- is it  beating? Then get the fuck up and do something!  Fall in love! Yes, fall in love like in the movies that spark of electricity between two lovers lips  go to sleep and wake up dreaming perpetually intoxicated never wanting

      I have returned and decided to pursue this blogging and poetrying as a form of therapy. Not sure who to invite to this experience. I will email you tomorrow and maybe you will find it entertaining and pleasantly creative. Or maybe I wil tell no one.  3 points To mention currently:  1. Jimmy Kimmell is awesome. I never would have know this if he had just stayed on the Man Show forever. Thanks, Jimmy for showing me the way and the truth.  2.My observation regarding Britney Spears' career when I heard the rumor that she is considering posing for Playboy: it has been a five year long game of strip poker that is about to come to an end. Witty.  3. If you store your loaf of bread in the fridge, it will last, like, forever.  So otherwise I have nothing original today, but I have this poem, and if you saw the movie 21 grams you are familiar with it (its by Venezuelan poet Eugenio Montejo). An amazing film and amazing poem. I was just thinking about it and looked it up on the internet. I love the internet. So I am posting it. yes, I am a dork.    The Earth turned to bring us closer, it spun on itself and within us, and finally joined us together in this dream as written in the Symposium. Nights pased by, snowfalls and solstices; time pased in minutes and millennia. An ox cart that was on its way to Nineveh arrived in Nebraska. A rooster was singing some distance from the world, in one of the thousand pre-lives of our fathers. The Earth was spinning with its music carrying us on board; it didn't stop turning a single moment as if so much love, so much that's miraculous was only an adagio written long ago in the Symposium's score.

      OOOOH, Farhenheit 9/11 opens tomorrow. Which is cool. Except they are trying to  urlLink ban it .  But...   urlLink here is an Anti-Michael Moore article  worth reading. Very interesting. Please read and post a comment on it because I don't know what I think about it yet.   Slate is a good online magazine. They also have a  urlLink very condensed version of Clinton's new book , so you can read just the juicy parts and skip all the crap. Pretty cool.

      RAMBLINGS On a lunch break. Eating french fries (unusual for me). I am dead tired and stressed and feeling dirty today. We have this new computer situation at work and everyone is driving me crazy and I know I am being a mean bitch and I only have 1 more day until I am on vacation but that kind of stresses me out too because I have shit to get done and I have been a bum about it. I had to come in early today but I woke up five minutes before I was supposed to be here (at 7) and had no time for showering so I feel gross. I stayed up too late last night because friends came over and we had a lot of fun like we always do but I was the only one that had to get up freaking early for work. One of my friends was asleep on my couch when I left for work this morning. Ha. Sorry this is boring.  So dude, I really love my friend Skarlett. I thought we would be hanging out all the time since she moved into my apartment complex but we haven't really until the last couple of nights. We stay up ridiculously late talking and laughing, and she's just hilarious. We were talking the other night about how for things to get serious and work in a relationship the guy needs to have that soulmate vibey thing going on, and be a good match that is going to be good for you as far as quality is concerned (i.e., not a jerk, considerate, ambitious, stable, etc.). And that seems to never be the case. Except my first love, of course, because when I think about him I realize that we did have both those things going on. We had the soulmate vibey thing and he is one of the best guys I have ever met. But things ended anyway, even though we are still good friends and I still think he's the greatest. And its been...um...5 years or something since we broke up. We were babies. So maybe we were just too young. And then my other major relationship was just ridiculously complicated.  I am left to wonder what is next for me. I don't know what I want anymore. I am not sure if I even know "who I am" and all that gay shit. Dammit, I hate it when people use "gay" in a derogatory manner. Its so offensive.   So Florida happens Saturday. I am excited. 17 hour drive. 2 people. Theres a good chance we might have to score some meth before we leave. That is so just a joke. Ok, this is perhaps my lamest post ever, but what can you expect from someone sitting in a hospital pharmacy? So far the best thing that has happened to me today was a particularly nutty patient who came by, not to get a prescription filled but just to see me and tell me he loves my hair and I am a "hollywood diva" and I look amazing. And then he danced for me in the middle of the waiting room full of patients. Then he left.  Highlight of my day, for real.  Well, this hollywood diva is signing off, and if I don't post for a while its cause I am livin' it up down at beach with my best friends. What color should I paint my toes before I go?

      A boring pointless post....  Coffee and Cigarettes is a fucking amazing movie! I didn't want it to end. Maybe I will go see it again. Perhaps in Florida with Adia, my coffee and cigarettes friend. God, how many hours did we spend at Javahead's talking and smoking and drinking coffee? I miss you, girl!  But anyway, yeah, it is an awesome movie.   Afterwards, I drove around listening to the yeah yeah yeahs and smoking and was behind this badass cadillac with a personalized license plate that read "ECUADOR". how cool is that?  I also got behind an old civic with a license plate that read "DRUM". After that, a yellow cab minivan with a dvd player in it, although I couldn't see what the lucky passengers got to watch.  I am not going to buy groceries until after my trip to florida. In other words, I will be eating rice, sweet potatoes,and frozen Indian dinners for the next two weeks.  Maybe I will publish a book called the "Eat Only What You Have In Your Apartment" Diet. It will sell millions.

      ok creepy. i know this "free" version of blogger is supported by advertising, but how creepy is it for me to see that after that post with a lot of "rock"s in it (see below)there is now an ad for downloading punk rock music, a barnes and noble "indie rock" ad, and an ad for "babes for rock" and sometimes theres an amazon add related to "social personality disorder" *see several posts below). creepy. let me see if i can manipulate it into more interesting ads....ok here it goes:   gay sex teenage sluts breasts   ok maybe it will hook it up with some porno now!  for the kids.  on a totally unrelated note (or perhaps related??) go here  urlLink  www.unbrandamerica.org    and spread the word, yo

      im so angry at the world right now....grrrr....I could start the 90's all over again, I have so much angst.   I must find a truth that is true for me . . . the idea for which I can live or die.  -Kierkegaard

      So why would I not be a happy motherfucker right now? I just got back from a rockin' show in Lawrence, one of my favorite places in the world. So let me break it down: 1 badass rock show 2 "search for change in my car to pay the toll on the Kansas Turnpike" moments 3 Pitchers of Pabst 4 cool motherfuckers rollin' in my Saturn down to Lawrence to see the show 5 dollars was the cover. Rock! 6 cigarettes. Dammit! 7 the number of times I use "rock" or "rockin'" in this post 8 what time I have to get up tomorrow 9 what time I will actually get up 10 minutes to downtown, is 10 minutes too far  The opening band  urlLink Kelpie  was awesome, too. Lawrence natives I believe and I totally dug them. They even covered the Beatles "Your mother should know" and it was so rock and I loved it. Look out for them...you heard it here first. Unless you heard it somewhere else.  I didn't even mind driving 3 sleeping friends back to Kansas City afterward. It was nice, I felt like the dad driving the kids back home after a day at the beach....(the beach...aww, I miss Florida! Will be there soon! So happy!)  So, to sum it up, Portland punk has stolen my heart! The Thermals rock, its official. Word.

      This must be her place. It smells like Nag Champa incense and rock music. Yes rock music, because her computer is playing the Yahoo "indie rock" station. Oh, yeah, and I bet she skips Dashboard Confessional and Saves the Day. And here is her medicine cabinet, where tiny bottles of pale yellow Clinique Moisturizing Lotion line the shelves. Its beautiful.  She fancies bookstores like Prospero's down on 39th, a wealth of used books and home to monthly poetry slams, but more often finds herself at Barnes and Noble at the Plaza, where they have hurriedly barricaded the doors with stacks of books about Ronald Reagan and books by Ronald Reagan. A true measure of a great life lived: how many people buy a book or CD after you die.   Anyway. Royals lost 2 days in a row. Whatever, I've stopped caring. They are like the boy that just ISN'T going to call.

      TODAY, you should learn about  urlLink VORTEXES .   So here's the deal...im going to put a  urlLink link  on here to read my poetry instead of mixing it in with other ideas. Someday I will get around to actually organizing it.  I also have enabled "commenting". so post like a 37 cent stamp!

      time to update.  i guess.  i still have pics i want to put on here but i havent been staying at my apartment and they are on that computer so i will do that when i get a chance. i REALLY was planning on getting a new digital camera but now i just got 2 speeding tickets in the last week so i dont know if i can swing it...fuck it, maybe ill be stupid and buy one anyway and just eat ramen noodles for the next month. or try anorexia. anorexic girls are hot. im totally kidding, thats gross.  so i am going to the braid show tonight. (with the get up kids. 'cept i heard they might cancel cause one of their wives is having a baby or something.) Braid totally still rocks my ass. its cool (and rare) when good bands reunite. (Hey Matt Talbot...!!!)  something i know about: it feels good to be at the top, with the wind in your hair and nothing but air and chance and hope and opportunity before you. but your smile turns to a scream as you plummet to the fucking ground, with the earth rushing to meet your stupid face.  and its too late then.  sorry i am a pessimistic asshole today and yesterday and the day before and tomorrow and the next day. but soon i shall be a hopeful child of God again. um, hopefully.  DO NOT SEE NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. It sucks a big one. Funny for 5 minutes, then I wanted to kill myself and the dude who made the movie. Or at least get my 8 bucks back.  later fuckers and fuckettes.

      "our love is like the border between greece and albania"   a&nbsp;night worth blogging.   actually, nothing special at all. we went to my parents house for a little birthday dinner for my little sister, hung out with my bro and he and aj played xbox and shit. watched the new ali g.  but it was the drive home...   its so fucking beautiful outside. about to rain, lightening in the distance. breezy and mild, a welcome change from the sweltering heat. (midwestern summer&nbsp;days turn a can of coke into nasty hot sugar water if you leave it in your car for 5 minutes). but&nbsp;tonight&nbsp; was perfect.&nbsp; so i am driving home and crossing the bridge back into the city, and the skyline is so lovely. and my window is down and i am smoking a fag and letting my hand hang out the window a little so that the pressure pushes it back against my car. i am listening to the mountain goats, music that i have heard a million times but the lyrics are so beautiful that every note&nbsp;leaves my heart swollen with childlike appreciation.  'twas a moment i wish i could capture and place in a jar like a little lightening bug and show all my friends.   anyway........enough of&nbsp;all that jazz....  i am on the move as far as job hunting goes. i have printed out stuff off of the internet at least. its a start.  goodnight. i am going to bed sober and&nbsp;hopeful.

      I am on my 41st post which means I have almost as many posts as  America has had presidents . I will have to do something special to celebrate number 43. In the meantime,  all I want to to sleep soundly and wake up refreshed . And that hasn't happened in so long. Nevermind that its my own fault. Like its almost 3am and I just got back from Bert and Ernie's (haha). No, I was at my friends house watching them play video games and enjoying it.&nbsp;And before that,&nbsp;an  evening of baseball ... it was so much fun.&nbsp; Its amazing that I have someone that I can literally do  anything in the world with  and have a wonderful time.&nbsp; And never get sick of him. Its so crazy.&nbsp;I know I sound like a moron.  So Sleep. I am coming to you. &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      post. post. post.  &nbsp; i came home today because i had a doctors appointment this morning and they drew blood and i fainted and puked. i was drenched in sweat and shaking after that and i couldn't function. isn't that weird?  i think the nurse thought i had an eating disorder, too, because she commented on the absence of food in my puke, asking "whens the last time you ate, hmmm?" all suspiciously, noting that i have lost 15 pounds in the last month or so. sorry that is all too much information. so anyway, i came back here and hung out at skarlett's and she fixed me lunch and i felt better after eating and chilling out. now i have to get ready to go to a baseball game. i hope its not too hot. i hope the royals dont suck. oh wait, they do. but whatever, we shall have fun drinking beer and partaking in America's favorite pastime. i still kinda feel like shit. watched a pbs special on octopi. very interesting, they are really intelligent. its funny how i am sorta kinda quasi-obsessed with marine life (specifically mermaids, seahorses,&nbsp;starfish&nbsp;and octopi) but the deep dark&nbsp;ocean is the scariest thing i can think of.&nbsp; if i was a mermaid, i wouldnt be scared though. kim cattrall said on the view today (gimme a break, i was at&nbsp;home sick)that women are the only female species that have orgasms.&nbsp; mermaids are almost human...i wonder if mermaids have orgasms?

      i wish i could tell the whole truth on this blog, because sometimes things are exploding within me and i don't know how to suppress them. however, i&nbsp;have recently learned the beauty of not suppressing things.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  these things are godly. these things are fucking pure. these things make my knees so weak i can barely drive home.  &nbsp;  now, i do go to sleep to dream.

      for those keeping score mother nature is a whore  didnt get into law school. shit.   also, my personal life is a dizzy carousel of confusion and wonder.  any day now the sky will open up and swallow us all whole. thats the next logical step. i am blissfully dreaming and hoping and wishing for the best...for fairy tales and rainy summer nights. every once in a while stars shine in my eyes. but then there's the punch in the gut snap-back-to-reality-oops-there-goes-gravity.  who the fuck reads this shit? really, tell me who you are.

      The truth is hard to swallow  I hate the facts&nbsp;  Praying for sleep  When sadness attacks.   Insomnia  Withdrawal  The pain in my brain  Bad guys doing drive-bys  On Penny Lane.   Drowned in delirium  Writing poetry in my head  Waking up sweating  Sunshine finds me in bed.

      AN OVERWHELMING LIST OF THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE ME A BETTER PERSON  1. going to the gym. seriously. 2. quitting smoking anything ever. or at least slowing down the self destruction. 3. therapy? 4. cleaning my apartment. 5. eating healthier. 6. writing, reading, painting, drawing, creating. 7. bettering my financial situation.  8. less worrying and being sad so often. more happy times. even when alone. 9. getting active in local politics. 10.getting back in touch with the whole God/spirituality/soul thing.  The truth is, I feel like I don't do anything to better myself and I am really only happy when with my friends, laughing and goofing off. Which is great, don't get me wrong, but I need something more than that. I feel fat and unhealthy and spiritually dead. I mourn on a daily basis. My lungs and brain hurt. My place is a mess. I am doing nothing about the things I care about the most. I spend too much money, and I have nothing to show for it. I hate my job. I keep thinking about the fact that a couple days ago, this body of mine was floating in the Atlantic Ocean. If I could just capture that moment forever, I wouldn't care about these other things. I am never going to get over it. I wish I was a mermaid.

      Between dairy farms and golf courses She traveled  White girl who never sang the blues Felt the pain of a broken heart, A neglected chakra. Ribs broken for easy access Bloody bones pierce flesh like a Jesus spear. A godless moment A lovers moment The truth, Hidden within sealed envelopes and Afghani burqas, Is that I could do this all day long.

      You are dead and watching another player.   Instant Karma is going to get you. We totally ditched the play last night at intermission because it SUCKED and it was so NOT KAFKA and so I said, hey guys if we can just go over to McCoy's I will buy you all drinks. Loren did not want to go and we bullied her into leaving. She said she felt guilty. I said, well good, feel guilty because THAT is fucking Kafka. So we went and had drinks and then J and L left and AJ and I went to my car to find my damn car battery dead so then we called them to come back to jump us off and and they observed that the people from the play were standing outside while we were dealing with the car situation. The theatre was so small they had to notice that we didnt come back from intermission. I am sure it hurt their British feelings. And then there we were with our dead battery. Jason was right, it was karma i think. But it was so bad. I swear Franz was rolling in his grave. And by rolling, I mean taking ecstasy and listening to rave music. Yeah, Franz Kafka.

      Do the Evolution...  I have been updating a lot lately havent I? Chalk it up to boredom/escapism. Hmm.  1. A lady today said "blah blah blah...he's my favorite author! his chapters are so short!"  She's also the lady that exclaimed, "Well, crap a duck!"  2. I have been thinking of Hare Krishna's. Loren and I were talking about how they aren't at the Plaza anymore. Where did they go? Were they asked to leave? Because I like them. The Christians and the Scientologists at the Plaza are much more annoying.  3. Hare Krishna's are cool, but they don't believe in evolution. Neither do Kansans. I am cool with different belief systems and stuff,  but if you say you don't believe in evolution, I am kinda going to think you are an idiot. Sorry if this offends you.  4. My new cat cried ALL NIGHT. I am so tired. I feel bad because he is used to being free and now I have sentenced him to a life in captivity. But its a life of being taken care of, with food and water and air conditioning and heat in the winter.  So we are just going to have to deal with it, Vinny. Suck it up.  5. Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.  6. Jason, Loren, AJ and I are going to see a theatrical version of Kafka's The Trial at the Westport Coffee House tonight at 8. Should be cool. Some theatre troupe from England.  7. Loren is going to paint my portrait soon. She is an amazing artist. This will be cool.  8. Where is Skarlett?

      tallahassee feeling in the pit of my stomach driving around on this beautiful day i can see with my mind's eye the Florida state capital students walking around campus Tennessee Street Tom Brown Park  I don't know what it is, I think it might be the amazing sunny, mild weather here. It reminds me of October in Tallahassee I think.  Oh, I love it. Maybe its that I am listening to the mountain goats and my fingertips smell like clove cigarettes. Maybe I just miss my old home. My friends. My life.  A southern girl lost in the midwest.

      i forgot to mention that i went to the kerry/edwards rally friday night. i was out with my friends and we drove by union station and there was all kinds of shit going on so we parked (far away) and checked it out and damned if we weren't there for a big kerry/edwards rally, with thousands of people and speeches and Van Halen's "Right Now" blasting over the speakers. saw edwards speak and some of kerry but we left when kerry was speaking though because we knew traffic would be a bitch.  i didnt get that tingly exciting feeling that i usually get at political events. i guess thats because the democrats kinda suck and i am not enthused about all the bullshit that kerry and edwards were hollerin' about("Hope is on the way!!"). but hey, don't worry, i  will  vote for him but not with the passion and hope that my 19 year old self voted for Nader with. the world is so disappointing sometimes.    so yeah, i witnessed first hand the guys we have to put in office in order to get Bush out. and i dont have much to say about it. i showed more enthusiasm at the royals game saturday (who lost 7-5).
