       Pondering the Mountaintop   Hello everybody!  I was talking to my mom one morning, and she was telling me about this cool thing she read in her devo book, and I thought I'd post it.  She was saying how in the Old Testament, when Moses went up to Mount Sinai and was talking to God, he asked God to show him His face.  Then God said He couldn't, cuz His full presence would kill Moses, but He showed Moses part of His presence.  When Moses came down from the mtn., he was covered in the glory of God and just glowing.  All the people in the village thingy, or whatever they lived in, asked if they could get that too, so Moses led a bunch of them to the top of the mtn.  At the top, God was showing Himself in a huge thrundercloud with lightning and thunder and stuff.  Moses told the people to walk inside of the cloud, cuz that's where they would find God, but they were afraid, and wouldn't do it.  So he went inside the cloud and was calling them from inside, telling them that they should just take the step from the edge into the cloud.  But they were too afraid, and therefore, missed out completely from seeing a beautiful experience with God.  A lot of times, we do that in worship, prayer, faith, or whatever God wants us to do, for that matter.  We get the the edge of the cloud and just get too freaked out to just take that one step into His glory.  And we miss out.  So I was thinking about that, and thought about how those people must've felt when the came down from the mountaintop.  Probably the way we do when we come back from Spring Fling, a prayer retreat, etc.  Charged up, but still thinking, in the backs of their minds, 'I didn't do enough.  I should've taken the step into God.'  Of course, most of us never talk about it, and we just brush that feeling away.  But it's true.  I mean, to be honest, there are so many times that I know God's leading me somewhere, but I get too scared to completely let go of it, and just ask if maybe He could hold off for another day.  And I miss my chance.  So I think that this is something everyone can relate to, and can use to really find out what's truly keeping them from God's presence.  Pride, selfishness, fear, inhibitions?  We all have things that keep us from going 100% for God 100% of the time, and I think that if all of us in Fusion, and especially on the worship team, let go to God, maybe we'd be in a different place.  Not that where we are is bad or anything, but I know sometimes it's really hard to get into worship onstage.  I dunno, maybe I'm alone here, but I thought I'd post this, becuz I can't help but wonder what if.    ~Erika <>

       Worship for Nov. 9   I just wanted to say how great I thought last nite at Fusion was!  I mean, it seemed so much like we were a team, and more so than it really ever has been.  I had just been praying that day that God would really show up, and He totally did.  The congregation got into it pretty well, and more than that, the worship team was so in tune!  I mean, it was weird cuz that was exactly what I had been asking God for.  I noticed a couple mistakes here and there, and Jaime and I even forgot our parts for Breathe, but it didn't matter at all.  It flowed so well, and even when something weird happened, we knew it happened, but it didn't matter at all...no one got thrown off or anything?  Isn't that so amazing?  God is so incredible, and I'm so thankful that we're finally starting to really worship as a GROUP, instead of as individuals sharing a stage.  I understand from some perspectives that there was no unity whatsoever in the times before I was there, but even when I got there, it seemed really tense a lot.  People would get frustrated with each other really easily, and overall, we were kinda messed up.  But now, we are such a team, and I think that God is really trying to do something here.  I had been talking to God about this for a while, and I kept feeling as though God has been trying to do something really incredible, but there were things on the team that were totally hindering Him.  And Pastor Joe even talked about that today...how we can completely limit God's blessings.  I think there were some really bad attitudes on some peoples' minds, and I think that although it's not completely gone, it's getting better, and we've relaxed a lot more.  We've really realized (ALL of us) that it's not about us.  I mean, we say that all the time, but I mean, come on...I know a lot of people didn't take it seriously all the time, and I know I was guilty of it!  So I'm glad that now we've just finally gotten to a point where we're really on the road to where God is leading us.  Tension has really dissipated, and patience has begun to take its place.  I'm so in awe of God, you guys!  He is so good!!  This makes me wonder how people can just not get into worship...just things like this that make us really happy we're in His will, ya know?    ~Erika <>

       Worship for Nov. 23 (It Just Gets Better!!)   Wow, worship last Saturday nite was incredible!  Everything flowed so well, especially at the end.  The sermons by Michael and Dono were really good, and I think they woke people up a little.  During the first worship, I noticed a lot of people sitting around and some talking, but later that nite, so many people were getting into God!  I mean, wow!!  And everything flowed so well that I think we're really growing as a team, guys.  The more we become a team, the more God can use us to work through, and we're getting there faster than I thought we were.  And although a lot of people left later towards the end, God hadn't left at all.  Some of us just kept going with it, and it only got better.  We're getting there guys, and it'll only keep getting better.    ~Erika <>

       The Ark on Jan. 12   The trip to the Ark was really good, in my opinion.  It was strange that I was really not nervous at all...I hate being in the spotlight--Jaime is only slightly worse than me.  Jaime, Nat, and Haley went up to the girls' camp to encourage people to go, and Michael and I stayed back to practice worship.  Ok, fine, I will admit that I was pretty nervous before people came in, but that's weird too, that I wasn't nervous when a ton of people were in there.  Anyway...I was kinda thrown off, cuz like an idiot, I procrastinated listening to the cd Michael gave me that had One Thing on it.  I figured, well, I've heard the song before, so I'm sure picking out a harmony'll be a piece of cake.  No.  I sat there on Saturday nite for a half an hour listening to that one song, and I couldn't find a harmony, except for little snatches of it here and there...frustration!!  So in the end I wound up singing melody with him...it's weird to sing melody anymore cuz I'm so used to singing harmony to virtually every song!  It was kinda strange before Nat got there to sing during the actual service, cuz before she got there, I was the only girl singing, and I felt really exposed...I'm so not used to being in the spotlight or really even being heard in worship at all, lol.  But in the end it went really well, and when Nat got there, it added a little more fullness to the songs.  Overall, I think everything sounded really good.  Adam got up and did his sermon thing, and that went really well.  I think he needs to be some kind of professional speaker or something, cuz he's so well-spoken, even when he's just talking in a normal conversation.  He didn't sound nervous at all, which is saying something, cuz I know that when I get up in front of people to talk, my voice gets kinda shaky and stuff...ugh.  Anyway, so yeah, his sermon went really well and then Pastor Rick got up and did a kinda altar-call thingy, only it was more like he was just talking about the benefits of God.  It was really good.  I think I want to go up more on Sundays, cuz it was really fun, even if I didn't really connect with anyone.  I think that if I went up more I would wind up clicking with someone, and that would be fun, cuz most of them are really nice, they're just hard to talk to at first.  So anyway, just wanted to talk about the Ark and everything since my blog is pretty much devoted to ministry.  Oh, and lesson learned--when someone gives you something to listen to, listen to it sooner than 10 hours before you're supposed to sing it!!  ;o)  ~Erika <>

       Worship for January 11   Worship Saturday nite was so awesome!  I mean, lately it's seemed that the congregation has been kinda...blah (this excludes the 28th, cuz I heard that was really good).  I don't know everyone's hearts, so I don't know if they're really getting into it or if they're just bored.  But it's been kinda frustrating.  So it was really nice to be standing on the risers, worshiping, and then open my eyes to see so many people jumping around.  I was so blessed!  I could really feel God there, and it was so incredible to feel freedom in Him, the way we haven't seen at Fusion for a long time.  Although yes, there are always the one-sey, two-sey people jumping (Meg, Bobby, Michael, Zack), we used to have so many more people just dancing.  However, we have been missing Dono, so that explains a lot.  ;o)  This may sound kinda hypocritical, cuz I'm not someone who really is a dancer in worship...I tend to want to be in the back lately so that I feel more free to do whatever without feeling peoples' eyes on me (whether they are or I'm just paranoid I don't know), but typically I don't jump around unless I'm really, really, really into it.  So it probably sounds kinda hypocritical to say it's frustrating to not see other people jumping around.  To quote the girl from YWAM who painted bookmarks: "Worship is a heart posture, not a physical posture...though often the former expresses itself in the latter."  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I haven't really felt God truly move in Fusion for a good month or more, and the people who are usually all over the place, or at least clapping, half-yelling/singing, or even raising their hands were not.  So what I'm really saying is that I really saw and felt God move Saturday night, and I felt blessed to be a part of it.  Our team continues to grow closer together, and it's so awesome to see that happening.  God is going to do something with us, guys, but He can't do it till we're all moved into the right position.  Therefore, it is so crucial that we work together, and so beautiful to see that actually occuring.  What James said before practice has really stuck with me, about how we used to have to pray every time for no stress, attitudes, or tempers, and how we don't even say that anymore.  I don't know how to express how grateful I am to be a part of a team that is becoming so unified so quickly, and under some of the most unlikely circumstances and pressures.    ~Erika <>  PS--I found this really cool quote in my Nichole Nordeman cd...it really doesn't have anything to do with what I just wrote, but I thought I'd put it in cuz I felt like it: "She who reconciles the ill-matched threads of her life, and weaves them gratefully into a single cloth - it's she who drives the loudmouths from the hall and clears it for a different celebration where the one guest is You." --Rainer Maria Rilke.

       125 x 25   Wow, Saturday nite was so amazing!  I mean, aside from the obviously cool fact of having 160 people, worship was so good!!  It was so much fun to see everyone getting into it, and it's just such a blessing to know that God's working thru you to lead people into His presence.  I came in that day after having a really crappy day...my mom and I had been arguing in the car, and then when I was able to actually leave the car, the first thing I encounter was a friend say "You're in big trouble!"  She was only joking, but I was so not in the mood, cuz I knew I was late, so I was thinking maybe I am in trouble?  So I come in and someone runs up and tells me that we're learning a new song...I didn't know it was Dance in the River, which is really easy cuz there're no harmonies yet...but I was thinking, 'Oh crap, I have to figure out a harmony, and Kevin Brewton's not here!'  So the stress was really setting in, on top of the bad mood I was already in.  Then I had about 5 people come up and ask me if I was ok, which is nice to hear that they care, but at the time I just wanted to go into the bathroom or something and just be alone and quiet for about 10 minutes.  I was just getting really emotional about really dumb stuff, and I was so tense over everything, and I kept telling myself, 'Erika, get a hold of yourself!  You're at worship practice now, everything's fine, you're gonna live!'  So I started to calm down and I was just trying to pray in my head and become rational again.  So the stress really only lasted about 10 minutes, but still, I just wanted to hurry up and get started on everything and forget about me.  We're in a circle praying, and someone who shall remain nameless (JAMES!), lol, asked me if I was ok, which was really nice, but then like 5 people swiveled around and looked at me and I was like, 'Ok, I'm officially ready to crawl under a rock!!'  (But thanx James, cuz it was really cool of you, I needed it.)  So yeah, after that, everything really was ok, and the new song was way easy, since the background vocalists do almost nothing.  So my point was, it was way awesome to see all these people getting into worship, and for myself, to just let go of all the crap going on in the real world and focus on God.  It was so what I needed, and to see everyone getting into God and really going for it was such a tremendous blessing.  I feel kinda bad cuz I wasn't able to invite anyone to the service though, cuz I wrote my list before Pastor Rick said we needed to invite these people to 125x25.  One person doesn't even live here, and then 2 people I don't have their numbers, and then the last person had a basketball game.  So I'm really not sure why I just went into this huge thing about my irrational problems, but I think I was just saying that it doesn't matter where you are or how you feel, but if you let go to God, He'll totally take you to a new level with Him, where you can forget about everything, and all's right with the world (wish I could build a summer home there!!).  It was such a blessing to me, personally, to see so many people being ushered into God's presence just like I was...forgetting about everything and just seeking the one answer to every problem.  ~Erika <>

       Saturday Was So Fun!!! (Worship Feb. 8)   Oh yeah!!  I think practice was so much fun on Saturday, and I don't really know why...nothing really exciting.  I just was in a really good mood I guess.  And then I talked to James, who talked to me about having Jaime and me play keys.  I am so looking forward to that cuz I really have felt like God is calling me to start doing that.  I've been practicing keys at home, cuz I play piano anyway, and it's become so dang easy.  I thought, 'Well, if Stacy's not here sometime, I can just play for her,' and then I thought about how it might be a bit weird not being able to ever you know, not hafta be up there playing keys, if we're playing every week now.  But then James told me that Jaime's gonna start playing too, so now we'll be able to alternate, and that's totally awesome!  God is so good, and He just opens all the right doors at all the right times!  So anyway, sorry, back to worship practice.  But yeah, so that went really well, and then when we really got going into the service, wow!  I mean, it was pretty dead the first few songs, and that wasn't fun, but then Pastor Rick got up and talked, and the whole baptism thing happened.  (So awesome!)  Then after that, worship really, really got good.  I think people were really awake by then (about time!!), but everyone was jumping around, and there was just such a spirit of freedom in that whole place!  Dono's song is really good.  Nicole helped us find a harmony to the chorus, and that was really good, cuz it needed some depth.  I really hope we start doing more of our own stuff, you know?  I mean, I love the stuff we do normally, but I think it'd be so fun to be doing stuff that's original.  And then we learned Show Me Your Glory, which was really easy once Kevin Brewton and Nicole helped Jaime and me with the high harmony.  I just had such a good time that nite.  And then at the end, all of us singers, with the exception of Nicole, jumped off the stage and were jumping around, and that was so fun!!  (Although, and I don't understand why, cuz I work out almost every day, my calves are still sore as I write this!)  I think, personally, that Bobby should start leading some songs, cuz I think he has a great voice.  And if he can jump while he's playing guitar, he can sing while he's doing it too, lol!  Anyway, so yeah, it was just really awesome, and it's just been getting better for me personally, cuz I've been getting so much more comfortable being normal (in worship, strictly speaking, lol) onstage.  Speaking of which, I was kinda surprised that I was asked to sing I Could Sing with Jaime, but it was really fun in worship, so I hope we get to do it sometime again.  However, I've been told I need to back off mike cuz I'm overpowering Jaime...oops (sorry Jaime!)  It's really weird singing up front though, cuz I've never done it before with the band playing, and it's so   loud  !  Yeah, and I say that like I'm not used to being loud in my everyday life...but I wasn't nervous at all up there, which was majorly good, since Jaime had enough stagefright to supply everyone on that team.  (jk Jaime!)  So yeah, I don't know if any of this really makes any sense, cuz it's all kinda about different stuff, but I am just so glad that each week results in our team becoming more like a family, and so much more tightly knit.    ~Erika <>

         A Few Firsts (Worship Feb. 22)     Saturday nite was really fun.  For one thing, and probably the most dramatic, was that Jaime played keys with the group for the first time!!  YAY!!  Yeah, all week we were talking about it, and she was kinda nervous, but she did so well.  The only thing to comment negatively on was the fact that the sound guys wouldn't turn her up enough, so we couldn't hear her much in the house.  However, I could hear her onstage pretty well if I listened for her, and what I heard was really, really good. The keyboard is pretty old, and the number 7 sticks, but that's ok.  She did really well playing, and especially in Hungry.  I know she's been practicing that song all week every spare minute she can find!  So yeah, anyway, another really cool thing was that as a band/team, we learned two new songs in one practice session!  Isn't God so cool??  We learned History Maker, which to be honest, I really didn't like before, but now it's actually pretty cool.  And then we learned Hungry (Falling on My Knees), and that was ok.  I mean, musically, it was great, and Scott and Nicole sounded fine.  But it was really my first time singing onstage, up front with the leaders for the service, and I was really disappointed in myself cuz I couldn't find a harmony worth crap!!  Frustration!!  So Nicole and I wound up having me sing an echo in the melody, and that was ok, but it didn't have the same quality vocally that I was looking for.  I dunno...it just didn't have the right ring.  I couldn't sing the high harmony, cuz it's pretty much a soprano range, and the middle harmony echo is too low.  Ergh!!  So yeah, I was really hoping I'd have found a much better thing to sing, cuz it wasn't quite what I was looking for, but overall, I think it sounded good, and as long as it can lead people into worship, that's all that really matters.  History Maker sounded really good, in my opinion.  The guitar in it was really fun, and then in Hungry, the drums and keys were really cool too.  Anyway, so overall, I think practice went so well, and then the service was really awesome.  It was Ignition, and Alpha and Vicky did the sermon.  They did such a great job!  I was especially impressed with Vicky, cuz she's normally so introverted around large groups of people that I was actually shocked when I asked her if she was interested in doing the sermon and she said yes!  She had looked up a lot of the Hebrew/Greek translations, and she found a lot of links of different meanings in the Bible that I have no idea how she could have found, even on PC Study Bible.  Although PCSB can confuse me sometimes.  But yeah, I was really happy about how Saturday sounded and went overall.  However, since Jaime played this past Saturday, that means I'm next for this coming weekend.  And even though it's Sunday, and not even the week yet, I'm totally psyching myself out already!  How lame is that??  But I know I can do this, but I'm just freaked out, partly subconciously, cuz I'm thinking about how maybe they're not gonna want me to play after how well Jaime did.  Maybe that's really dumb, but I tend to be a bit of a pessimist when it comes to me playing piano.  Like I said, I know I can do this, and I know God's called me to do this, so really, I have nothing at all to worry about, cuz as long as God's on my side, He's totally got me.  I'm just paranoid freak sometimes.  But anyway, all that aside, I am so proud of our team.  It's so exciting to watch God really play a part in such a big way.  That said, I'd like to end with a quote from my Nichole Nordeman cd, cuz I think it really describes us:  "We stutter and we stammer till You say us--A symphony of chaos till You play us..."  ~Erika <>

         Worship March 1     Saturday nite was pretty good.  I played for the first time on the worship team, and it was actually a lot better than I thought it would be.  I had these pre-conceived ideas about all these horrible things happening, and none of them did, so I guess that's good!  It was a little embarrassing having to have Michael go over the verse with me in Enough about 20 times, and it didn't help that the main leaders (James and Bobby) kept listening in.  (No offense to them though, cuz I know it wasn't to make me nervous or anything.)  I finally caught on, and it was really good to have Jaime there with me.  I know she was singing and everything, but she could tell me which voices to put on what song, and could tell me if I was playing "too choppy"!  (lol, James!)   Then during the actual service I had a lot of fun.  I mean, it was kinda hard at first cuz the first song was Dance in the River, and all through the first part all I do is hold the D chord down...for the whole first part.  So I was trying to look like I'm giving my all for God, but I don't really think I could...and then it was really funny though cuz when everyone started dancing around, even onstage, everything was shaking...I had no idea that happened when I sang on the side!  I'm just sitting there playing my little D and G chords, and the whole floor starts shaking, and the keyboard starts shaking...I almost laughed cuz it scared me really bad at first cuz I honestly thought the keyboard was gonna fall over or something!  Whatever.  So I made my way throught the rest of the songs, and it was actually a lot more worshipful than I thought it would be.  I mean, at home when I'm playing by myself, I get into worship really well, but then again it doesn't matter if I mess up or not.  So I didn't really count on actually getting into worship this nite, but I did.  Overall, I think the night went really well...I had a really good time playing, and it wasn't as stressful as I thought it'd be.  I definitely thought Bobby was gonna get all frustrated with me or something, but if he did he didn't show it, and for that I am grateful!!  Oh, and he sounded great singing!  Go Bobby!!   Oh, and I'm glad that for that nite James didn't have me playing the verse in Enough, cuz it gave me some time just to sit there and raise my hands...that gesture used to be so casual, but now that I play, I'm grateful for the times when I actually can just raise my hands and start worshiping...weird, huh?   ~Erika <>

         Ark Ministry for March 16     Ok, going to the Ark was so awesome!  I mean, first, worship was really fun.  It's so weird cuz I get all nervous during practice, and then when everyone gets in there, I'm totally fine and nothing about it bothers me at all.  Luckily none of the songs were new to me, so it went better than last time.  I really like singing there, and I don't know why...anyway.  Yeah, so the last time the Ark girls came to Fusion, someone did an altar call for if anyone needed anything, and I went down and started praying with this girl named Carrie Ann.  It was really kinda depressing, cuz she was saying that she had a court thing she was going to the Tuesday after that nite, and she wanted prayer cuz she was kinda scared and she said she really wanted strength for going, becuz with all the charges against her, she said it was pretty likely she was going to go to jail.  Well, so we prayed, and I asked her if she had a Bible, and she said no.  So I went to Pastor Rick's office, and I got a Bible and some other stuff for her, and then I gave it to her, sat down, and never saw her again, assuming she went to jail.  Well today at the Ark, I was sitting next to this girl named Andrea, and I asked if she knew Carrie Ann (I kinda wanted to find out what happened with her).  "Yeah," she said, "she's fine, except she sprained her ankle, and she really wanted to come today, but she wasn't able cuz of her ankle."  I was so surprised that she was still there!  I told Andrea about what Carrie Ann had told me about the whole court/jail thing, and she said, "Well, she did go, but since her attitude was so good, they dropped every single charge."  Isn't that so awesome??!  I was so happy!  So I really wanted to see her, but since she wasn't there, obviously I couldn't.  That's why I'm kinda hoping I get to go to the Ark sometime again kinda soon, cuz I really want to talk to her.  Anyway, so that was pretty much all I wanted to say, cuz I thought that God showed up for her so much that I had to tell about it!    ~Erika <>

         It Never Fails (Worship March 22)     I had such a good time last nite.  I played keys for the second time, and it never fails--I get   so   strung up and stressed before I play.  I mean, during practice, I learned two new songs, and I was about to freak out cuz I Could Sing was really confusing me.  I'm not really sure why, but Bobby really intimidates me (probably cuz he's such a good musician), so I was really glad he wasn't getting all frustrated with me (well, maybe he did, but I couldn't really tell).  That one song was so frustrating to me cuz I had to ask him about five times how the chords went, or when this chorus is played when...poor guy.  But I did  finally  get the hang of it, and all was well.  The thing that I think is so weird is the contrast between being on the musician side verses being on the backup vocalist side.  On the musician side (which I'm still pretty new to, so maybe that's why it's so foreign to me), it's so much more intense...you really have to focus so much more on it.  It's actually nice, cuz if you've had a bad day, you totally forget it, becuz you have no free mind space to concentrate on anything but what you're playing, and if it's good or not (well, that's what happens to me anyway...unlike so many others on that team, it's not exactly effortless yet).  On the other hand, you have the backup vocalist side, and it's so much more laid back.  I mean, you can still pay attention and know what's going on, but singing is so much easier than playing...maybe becuz your throat is so much closer to your brain than your hands...?  I'm not really sure which one I like better...I really like each one a lot, which is why I'm so glad I get to participate in both.  Well, I came to youth in a really good mood, and I pretty much left in one too.  Wow, bonus!  And it never ceases to amaze me that when I really get into worship, everything else just flows.  Like when I'm singing, it doesn't matter if I lose the harmony I was supposed to sing--it flows, and it blends.  And it doesn't matter if I'm playing keys and I totally forget where I'm at and have to skip the whole rest of the line before I can catch back up--it still flows, and it still blends.  I could never be a soloist...working with such great musicians really makes you understand a lot, especially how much you need them when they totally cover you when you screw up!  But anyway, I thought the nite went really well, and I'm getting a lot more comfortable playing with the team.  I guess I always thought I'd be really paranoid, becuz I have such an anxiety when it comes to playing in front of people, but when it's with this band, it doesn't matter at all...weird, huh?  Gotta be God.  Well, I guess that's about it...oh, and once again, I think Bobby did  great  singing.  I think he underestimates himself vocally, which is really too bad, cuz his voice is so good...really strong and smooth.  He just needs to hear it more; he'll get more comfortable with it.  So I guess I said all this stuff, and totally forgot something that is a really big deal:  God is always there--He always shows up, and it doesn't matter if you're singing, or playing, or both.  He's there, and He always will reach you where you're at.  For some reason that has become quite the profound reality to me lately.  He's always by your side--but you set the pace.  Are you gonna play  to  Him or play  for  Him?  ~Erika <>

        Why Worry? (Worship March 29)    Last nite was so interesting.  I have been feeling really weighed down by some insecurities lately, and I had had a talk on Thursday nite with two people who really made me understand how to get over it.  It was really not something I wanted to get into with either of them cuz the reasons behind it are so stupid, but I am so glad I did...God spoke through them and really woke me up.  Well Friday I wound up spending some time just talking to God, and I totally felt it leave.  Any insecurity, doubt, or worry was just gone!  It was so cool.  And so then I came to youth on Saturday, and practice went so well.  I got the hang of the harmonies and stuff really fast on I Could Sing, and things just flowed really well.  And for some reason, I really like being in the front.  Like I don't know if I want to lead really bad or anything, I just like being there.  I can hear myself so much better, and I   loved   standing next to Nicole...her energy in worship is so contagious!  I was really impressed by Michael leading, cuz although he's led before a lot, he's never led an entire worship session (or two, really, if you count the one after).  I think he did so well...it was so awesome.  So anyway, worship for me was so liberating.  I was able to feel lighter almost, becuz all the other stuff I had had previously was just gone.  I could really mean the words I was singing.  I mean, it's not like worship is always some facade or something, but sometimes I just feel like I'm going through the motions, and my heart isn't really feeling what my mouth is singing, or what my hands are playing, ya know?  But tonight I really let go of all the things that were holding me back, and although maybe I didn't start jumping off of chairs or anything, I just felt God so much more...it wasn't just singing, it was expressing gratitude and laying aside my humanity--something I haven't really done in a while.  So anyway, it was just really great to feel so free and so unfettered by everything I'd been subconciously carrying.  I was so glad to finally be able to feel God's presence as strongly as I did last nite, and I fully intend to feel it again.  ~Erika <>

        God is Incredible!    I've been so stressed lately.  I guess it's just been a steady accumulation of things that have amounted to a great deal of stress on me mentally and emotionally.  I've been so worried about money for Costa Rica, and I really have no reason to be.  Last time we went, my parents were planning on going, but when they decided against it, I got all the money they had raised.  Basically, all the money I needed was handed to me on a silver platter.  I know I did a bunch of the fundraisers, but I didn't need to--they only supplied me with about $30.  However, this time I've had to really stand in faith for this.  Even though it sounds really dumb, I'd say this is the hardest faith fight I've ever had the displeasure of partaking in.  I know it was good for me, cuz it really taught me to rely on God more than anything, but it was so exhausting to me.  I asked him that if I wasn't supposed to go to Costa Rica, to not even get me the first $60 deposit.  Well, he did, and he got me everything else.  The thing that always got me was that I would be totally calm, cool, and collected until about a week before the money's due date every time we had one, and the I would stress out so bad!  For the last three deposits or so, I've had to learn patience, patience, and--oh! more patience!  Each of those times, the money would come in mere days before the due date.  However, the fact that God provided for each of them makes it totally illogical that I would stress about the next one, but it never failed--each time I would get so tense.  Anyway, it's pretty much wound up to a fevered pitch this past one, cuz it's the last one.  I got bad grades on a couple of quizzes for school, I've been getting in trouble a little at home for my tone of voice (when I get stressed, I snap at people totally unintentionally...ugh), and I haven't been able to sleep as well.  It's totally been nothing but stress for the past two weeks or so.  However, God came in for me to the max this time (of course--why anyone could ever have any reason to doubt him is beyond me, but it seems that I can always find something that I--unreasonably--subconciously doubt his ability to do).  I sent out a few support letters via email, and I wound up getting a total of $100 from three people.  I thought, 'Oh good--if they can just expidite it or something, I'll have it by Saturday, and hey, no sweat!'  No.  But it's really cool, cuz my mom and I were calculating my totals.  I owed for this weekend $186, but I got extra money from neighbors, fundraisers, doing chores around the house, and people spontaneously blessing me (you're awesome, Michael!).  So, when all was added up, I only owe $8 for this next deposit, and that's without what people emailed me about, and I get allowance, so all is well!  A lady from church is giving me $100, and added to the people who responded to emails, I've got all my money in, plus my SLAB money!  God is so good to me, and I don't know why I have trouble, sometimes, in giving him my full trust...it happens with big stuff like this, and I don't know why I let it get to me, when after all he's done for me, like he can't get me not even $2000 for something that's his will??  I guess I've been learning a lot lately.  So anyway, just thought I'd post and let anyone know who reads this blog how good God is!!    ~Erika <>

       Cancun!!     Ok, so I'm really happy--I get to go to Cancun for a week!!  It should be so much fun, and I'm sure it'll be great, but I'm gonna miss everybody so much!!  I mean, I'm leaving this Sunday, and then I won't see anyone for the whole week after, and not for the weekend either.  How depressing!  I'm not gonna be able to check email and everything, obviously, which I know sounds really dumb, but the Internet is practically my social life lately, aside from Fusion...hm...the downside to being homeschooled, no doubt.  Anyway, oh, another really cool thing though is that I'm out of school!!  YES!!!  And so many people are giving me crap about not being away from Jaime, and yeah, it's annoying, but kinda true--what am I going to do without her?  Oh well, maybe I'll just come back with a cute Cancun guy for her...anyway, I'll miss everyone a lot, and I'll be in prayer for Fusion and the drama on Sunday.  Good luck on the drama, guys!  Nat, make sure you backhand HARD!  ;o)  ~Erika <>

        Back from Cancun    Alright, I just got back from Cancun today.  What a week...it was really nice to just lay out by the pool, put on my Discman, and think about nothing but whether or not this particular part of the day is best suited for tanning.  It was good to just relax, and since I've just recently had to get all my exams for school done and raise all my money for Costa Rica, it was good to be able to get away from everything and do practically nothing for a week.  However, part of me wishes that I would be able to go on vacations like that when I'm really really stressed and having problems with people in youth or something--you know, when you actually would rather be anywhere but here.  But anyway, it was pretty fun--we had an all-inclusive thing, so we got room service whenever we wanted, and I learned how to make strawberry daiquiris (and how to actually spell that word.  And of course I meant how to make them minus alcohol...cough.), and I got a massage for a half hr...yeah, that was one of the biggest highlights, except for the first like, 10 minutes I was really uncomfortable with having someone's hands on my butt--at least it was a woman, though.  And then I got a manicure and pedicure, so yes, all in all, it was a good thing.  I did miss youth and the people in it a lot, though.  There were so many times I would hear or see something that would remind me of someone and it kinda made me sad cuz I realized how much I missed everyone.  I hear the Fusion service went really well, and I'm glad to hear it--for some reason I kinda feel like my weekend has been incomplete if I haven't been to Fusion or church or...you know, something having to do with Impact.  Oh, one of the biggest "duh" moments: realizing, walking down the Cancun terminal on the way to the baggage claim that I forgot to pack shorts.  Oh yes!  So we bought a couple of pairs and it was fine, but Lord...of all times to forget shorts, it's got to be in a place where the heat is so prominent.  I learned how to barter while I was down there, and I also learned that...well, I guess I didn't really learn this part, I guess I just deepened my confusion: why do Mexican guys see a girl and act like they've never seen anything female before in their lives??  And why would they flirt with a white chick when they've got those beautiful, naturally tan women down there??  Yeah, didn't get it before Cancun, and don't get it now.  And the legal drinking age is 18 down there--I also learned how much older than 18 some people think I look...they spiked my drinks even when I asked for no alcohol--"Oh, senorita, it tastes so much better with tequila!" "No thanks, I really want it without alcohol!"  Thus I also learned to automatically pass my drinks to my dad for testing before I drank them.  Wow, and what is it with guys and beer??  My dad takes supplement pills in the morning, and when we didn't have time for room service coffee or juice, what does he take them with??  Dos Equis XX!  Um...ew.  (The roomservice stocked our minifridge with sodas, water, and beer everytime they cleaned.)  And I got my hand kissed for the first time...yeah, I ask for a towel so I can tan, and after I write down my name and room number on the receipt, he takes my hand and kisses it...um, thanks...can I get a towel now?...Miguel?  Yeah.  Caucun was very educational.  Well aside from the rather obscure things I learned down there we went on a couple of tours and got to snorkel a lot and see some Mayan ruins (that was actually pretty cool).  Oh, and on top of everything, thank you very much, you can see that I did not die from Jaime withdrawals!  Yes, I missed her a lot, but she wasn't the only person I missed a lot, so there, hope everyone who reads this blog fully comprehends that!   So anyway, I had a pretty good time, and overall I say it was worth the turbulent and slightly nauseating flights I endured to get down there.  And another thing--good Lord, Spanish 1 doesn't go very far when you're actually in the Spanish element!  Yup, I'm out of school now, but I'm keeping my vocab book for review!  Ok, so pretty much I'm done now, but I just wanted to write about everything and tell everyone hi.  James, thank you for updating the Fusion page!!  Michael, I tried to bring you back a Stacie Ho lookalike, but to no avail.  So I tried to find a postcard with some hot Latina chick on it, but either they were naked (or close enough), or they were some grotesquely fat woman in a string bikini...either way, I didn't think it'd be a good thing.  Well, actually, I'm sure you wouldn't have minded a naked chick, but um...yeah, I'll have nothing to do with obtaining one for you.  And I don't know if Ricky reads this blog, but if you do, I wanted to bring you back some sand like you wanted me to, but I don't think customs would have been pleased by that.  And last but not least, Jaime, I missed you SOOO much, and I'll be calling you tomorrow.  I love you all!  ~Erika <>

       Back from Costa Rica--June 19 - July 28   Wow.  This past trip to Costa Rica was the oddest thing for me.  Things happened between God and me that I didn't expect, as well as between other people and me.  First of all, I was so grateful for the hotel we got to stay at, especially after the week-long village trip.  (Those bugs bite   hard!    I still have marks on my skin where the bites were, and it was like, a month ago!)  Thank God for hot showers!!!  But anyway, between God and me...in my mind, I thought God would have me healing sick people left and right, seeing deliveration, things like that.  No.  To my rememberance, the only sick people I got to pray for one-on-one were in the youth group.  But hey, God healed them on the spot!  Well, so I was getting a little anxious and a bit worried when we were starting our third week there and I had not been the main witness to a huge miracle, such as the deaf lady getting healed at the "Plaza Del Pigeon."  I talked to God about that, and I started feeling convicted because I had not taken the time to look at what had been done through me, regardless of what it was--I had prayed for lots of people for salvation, a couple people for some minor deliverances, and so what if the only sick people I prayed for were in our group?  God did it through me anyway, and I felt bad because I had not been able to feel the honor that you should feel that God chose   you   to be His chosen vessel, no matter how "big," or how "small" our minds may think the miracle is.  I started to realize how honored I felt when I brought in the net at the big Catholic church...I felt so nervous going up there, and then when I started talking, I said stuff that I hadn't even planned on saying...I could just feel God flowing through me.  And then I'm guessing about 30 people came up to get saved, and I got to lead them all in the Sinner's Prayer...not everyone gets to help God save that many people at once.  I was amazed, and when it was all over, I was on this huge adrenaline rush because of it--this joy that didn't really make any sense if I thought about how I used to think that just getting people saved was such a small task.  I helped many more people get saved after that day, and I appreciated it every time.  My level of boldness increased so much too--during the first part of the trip, I no more wanted to talk to one of those people than I wanted to jump off a cliff.  By the time we did our last dramas at Cartago (the place with the ruins, drunks, and mating dogs aplenty), I was so ready to do it--I had no reserves or hesitations talking to anyone.  It was such an incredible time of ministry for me.  I plan on keeping that boldness here.    Also, I found my calling in piano.  I've had a sneaking suspicion about that for a while now, but when we got to CR, it was confirmed.  I know that Michael, James, and Bobby have wanted me to step out and learn to improvise more on keys during worship.  Well, that takes some skill--it's a little bit confusing to know how to play out of nowhere just...you know...out of nowhere.  You have to know what notes blend with what chords, what combinations of chords you can put with base notes or chords...it's not just closing your eyes and playing whatever note your finger lands on.  Or so I thought.  My first experience with this was the worship service at Oasis.  Jaime and I both agreed on her playing the bigger keyboard as a filler, mainly--to have a synth or strings sound the entire time to provide the background filller, pretty much.  We also agreed that I should play the smaller one, which, we decided, would stay on a regular piano setting the entire time.  We both knew that the smaller keyboard was the one to provide, if any, all of the improv.  For some reason that didn't really occur to me until we were actually up there, and we were starting the actual service.  You see, during much of the practice we had, I didn't personally have any problems with anything technical, because my keys and mic were some of the first things they set up for me.  The main thing on my mind was that I had a black dirt smudge on my white shirt, and although a lot of people told me they could barely see it, I was convinced that the people in the back row would be able to see it quite clearly.  You might say I was a bit distracted.  Well, we got back from dinner, started service, and got into worship with the other worship team--they were really good.  In fact, Jaime and I agreed that the guys playing keys made us feel like total losers.  The times that the songs were just the kind you could jump around to, I admit that I was glaring with an unspoken envy at the guy on my keyboard.  'It's just not fair,' I thought.  Then we got up there onstage.  Everything was played pretty much as usual, on my end, until we got to Let it Rain.  (And I'm sorry, but it totally sounds better in Spanish--it just kinda rolls off your tongue in that language.)  I guess I had never thought of this before, but God put it into my head that of course, the notes you play in the chords are notes you can improvise with...that gives you up to four notes to mess with, and as far as keys are concerned, that's a nice selection.  So I started to play around with it, and for some reason, it was really easy, and it totally clicked.  By the time we were done in worship, I was very much enjoying this.  I'm still not sure why I never thought of that before--it's kind of one of those "duh" moments.  Well, I'm starting to do that more on the worship team here now, and it's so much fun!  My piano teacher's still going to give me a book on chord improvisations, but anyway, I just thought I'd write about all that calling stuff.    As for people, there was one person that I was completely changed by on this trip.  Scott and I got a lot of things worked out on this trip, and I'd say as far as people in the group are concerned, my friendship with him is the most dynamic, and the most unexpected.    Anyway, overall, Costa Rica was such a life-changing thing to me...God worked through me and taught me so many things that I'll never forget.  I am so grateful for the opportunity I had to go, and if there's anyone who supported me who reads this blog, thank you so much--you'll never know how much it meant to me and to the people of Costa Rica.    ~Erika <>

       Letting Go--Sept. 21, 2003   Ok, I'm completely wowed by how long it's been since I've written!  Sorry about that!  Lately I've been feeling that God is really wanting me to improvise on keys more.  To people who have been more or less "pushing" me to do that for the past several months (i.e., Michael, Bobby, James...cough), I really am grateful to you guys for that...I know you wouldn't have been asking me to do it if you didn't think I could.  Anyway, aside from mainly Michael seriously wanting me to do this, I really have felt like although he has been adding (positive) pressure from the outside, God has been adding pressure from the inside out.  It's been one of those things where I feel God wanting me to do it, but it's like standing on the edge of a cliff or something; it hasn't been time to jump; it hasn't been time for it to really happen yet.  The kind of ironic thing is, improvisation on piano is something that seems so abundantly difficult to me, yet something that no one can teach, really.  There are some things that you should know, like certain chords, inversions, and scales, and things like that.  I'll be focusing on learning those things, and really just to sum it up, learning to let go to God.  In some certain situations, taking risks is no big deal, but in other situations, I am so afraid to actually do it that I can never do it.  It makes no sense at all, because whereas I am totally wanting to parasail, but playing a few notes that were not planned in front of people at youth who know me and have seen me screw up...I so did not want to do that.  But now I'm willing to give it to God...it's the right time to start now.  It's not like I expect to be doing solos at the next service we play at, but God will be stirring that up in me now, and it's really exciting to me because although I'm kinda nervous about it, I know God's going to meet me.  He's not going to just let me do it on my own.  So anyway, that's about it, but I thought I'd post that for anyone who's interested.    ~Erika <>

       Growing and Changing--Oct. 4, 2003   Saturday night had a mixture of feelings involved.  First it was a little frustrating because I was trying to figure out what to do for certain songs on keys.  The style of my playing has to change with every song, pretty much, or it all sounds bland, and the styles don't mix right.  Then James came to talk to us about him stepping down.  I was totally shocked because Jaime hadn't mentioned it to me, and I hadn't heard anything about it before.  So at first I was kinda sad because he's always been here for us.  Then I started thinking that it's a good thing he's stepping down, because really, it's probably the only place where he can afford to do so.  He seems very dedicated in everything he puts his heart and mind into, and so I know it was really hard for him to step down.  However, he really deserves it...he has been with us a long time, and he has been such a motivator, encourager, and director for our team.  The only way we've gone from beginning to now is by God working through us...and James' words to us.  To James, thank you so much for everything you've done here...you will be greatly missed, but you deserve this break so much--enjoy it!!  So then we started working on stuff a little more, and I got a little more comfortable with what I was doing on keys.  I really need a pedal so that things don't sound so choppy on the slow, pretty songs.  Michael tried to show me some stuff that he wanted on the song Rescue, and I was kind of confused at first, but after a few minutes I started to understand it.  However, when we actually did Rescue that night, I totally forgot what he showed me, so I just played what I thought was right according to the Desperation CD.  In worship that night, I couldn't really tell if the congregation was really getting into it, because sometimes it's hard for me to see from the back of the stage, but I hear it was a little dead.  Oh well.  I think my favorite part was when Meg, Jaime, and I were playing during Breathe...I think it sounded pretty good with all three of us playing, and it was funny cuz it's the first time we've all done that and been able to do it well.  Girl power!  ;o)  Although I'm glad Dono's playing drums for us, it's kinda sad to me because I loved how he played sax.  It's beautiful when he plays.  But, he is a good drummer, and we need one, so it's cool.  Anyway, overall, our team has changed so much and grown so much since the beginning, when we had to press the point of, "Guys, we really need to focus on actually getting into worship when we're playing!"  God has really cultivated a lot of stuff in all of us--I think just about all of us have gotten better at what we were doing since we frist started, and it just stands as a monument to God's hand...and how He can do anything through someone who's willing to let Him.  ~Erika <>

       Back to Normal--Nov. 8, 2003   As usual, it's been a long time since I've written, but I guess lately that's how it's been.  When I first started writing, I wrote about every weekend, and now I only write about the ones that impact me or others I'm close to.  Oh well.    Saturday was pretty good, considering we didn't have our usual worship leader.  It's nice having Michael there because things seem to run smoother; people seem to pay more attention.  Not that nobody respected Bobby and Scott, but I don't know...Michael's the worship leader, and I guess that's just what we've all adapted to.  That's not a complaint at all, just a thought.  I think it's interesting how things seem a little lacking when we realize how much Michael really does lead  us , not just the congregation.  When he leads, he ministers to  us , not just sings to the congregation.  Anyway, so yes, worship practice was good, because, after all, Scott does know how to lead.    The more I play, the more understanding I gain from it.  Michael and I often have this little disagreement about playing with knowledge vs. playing without it.  But the thing is, I seem to have some sort of faith complex when it comes to just getting up there and playing whatever I hear.  Michael is constantly encouraging me to just step out and play it.  I say, "Sure, I'll play it...when I know what those notes are."  I'm afraid it's one of those circular arguments, but everytime we talk about that, I'm more encouraged to do it.  Just step out and do it.  So I pray about it and know that God is building it up in me, and every practice, I seem to be playing with a new piece of musical know-how in my head that I wasn't aware had been there before.  Perhaps it's always been there, perhaps it hasn't.  For instance, during worship, the actual worship with the congregation, I couldn't really concentrate on what I was playing as much because Bobby wanted me to sing.  So one song, a slow one, it was just music, no vocals, and I listened to the guitars.  I could somehow hear them more.  I don't know if it makes sense as anyone reads this, but I could hear the individual notes more clearly.  I couldn't quite place which notes they would be on my keyboard, but I knew the general vicinity, and if it was a black or white note.  That's never happened before...the best you could've gotten out of me was which octave it was in, and on my keyboard, there aren't even three.  So to all who belong to the "Erika needs to improvise" club, it really is happening.  I think God made me not to be an impulsive person, but one who does things only when she's sure it's right.  Either that or I'm just a total wimp.  Whichever.    The worship time as a whole was good.  It was missing Michael's playing and singing, but Bobby, Nicole and Scott did a good job working together to make sure there was never anything truly missing.  I was really surprised later, because I was praying with someone, and Bobby stepped up and sang for a while after the message.  As usual, he did very well, even though he thinks he always sounds like crap.    So anyway, I think that the night was really good for everybody...we flowed well and learned new stuff.  I recall something someone said to me when I think about our team: God tells us to renew our minds, but He never tells us to stop.  Maybe we're never supposed to stop growing, and although James isn't with us all the time, and Michael wasn't there that night, things are feeling back to normal.  ~Erika <>

       The War on Terrorism and Food for Thought   With all this talk of the Iraqi war stuff and the capture of Saddam Hussein really makes me think.  I just got done watching the first half of the presidential address on Fox.  I asked my mom, "Now that we have Saddam, what are we going to do with him--can we kill him here, or what?"  And she said, "Well, I think they're planning on sending him back to his country for his trial."  However, we both agreed that we really hope they don't do that, even though they might not have a choice, because Saddam has so much power over there--so many people hate him, but his dedicated followers are still many and still violent.  Iraq has a president, though--that's good news, although because of Saddam's previously mentioned followers, who's to say that president will last more than like, three days?  I wish him luck.  I also hope he has many bodyguards.  I also think about what'll happen to Saddam Hussein.  I'm kind of torn between what I think he deserves.  Have you ever seen Law & Order or something and they let a guy off because he was mentally unstable when he committed the crime?  That's kind of what I think about when I think about that evil man.  Part of me wants to hate him because he's done so many horrible things to so many innocent people, and yet part of me wants to feel bad for him because of two reasons:  One, have you ever seen a documentary of Saddam's life?  The man had a horrible childhood and was raised in a Communist country in a Communist family.  Being raised in a bad environment as a child definitely renders what a person will be like as an adult.  I mean, if I were raised in Saddam's place, I could have his exact thought processes.  A baby isn't born with vindictive, wicked thoughts engrossing it's brain.  And culture counts for a lot too--for example, some girls and I were talking about how we have to shave and stuff, and I said, "Well, if you lived in France or some country where girls don't shave, you would never think about shaving--it would never occur to you to grab your husband's razor one day and shave off all your leg hair."  In the same way, if you're raised in a Communist country, it can become part of your natural thought process to live with it without hesitation to its rules--unless you encounter someone who thinks differently.  Like if you never, ever heard the word of God, the name Jesus would never have any validity to you, because although God's work is reflected in His nature, Jesus doing miracles and dying on the cross isn't--does this make any sense?  So Saddam grew up in a culture that he thought natural, and obviously something happened to him to encourage him to do the things he does/did.    Two, to God, me gossiping or slipping a cuss word sometimes isn't any worse than what Saddam's done to all those people combined.  God loves him so much, and He died for Saddam's sins too.  So if Saddam repented and accepted Christ, we'd totally see him in heaven when we die.  God has just as much compassion for that man as he does for a tiny baby suffering (like Mike and Lynn's baby).    And on a third hand (because I can't really say on the other hand, as most people only have two), he deserves to die some horrible, painful death, like what happened to some people who were martyred and stuff.  It would only be justice embodied for him to give his life, or rather, have his life taken from him, in a terrifyingly violent and painful way.  It would also be justice for every man or woman who helped him to die as well, as they have contributed to the suffering and depravity that is Iraq.    Which is the right way?  Regardless of mercy, I think the SOB should have to undergo some torturous form of "justice," like being eaten alive by those scarob-things from that movie, The Mummy; or have his skin ripped off of him, stop when he passes out, and resume when he regains consciousness (by the way, that wasn't something I just thought up, I read it in  Jesusfreaks  by dcTalk).  And that's only pleasant compared to what he deserves.    However, I am a Christian, and mercy is something I do consider quite frequently--which is the Biblically-correct, God-loving thought process for us Christians?  Life or death, hatred or compassion?  ~Erika <>

         Youth on Jan. 17 and My Comfort Zone Theories     Youth was really good for me this weekend.  It was kinda weird because Pastor Rick's older d-group was gone, minus Nathan and Michael, so we had the regular backup singers, then Tom, Aaron, Weston, and Madison playing for the guys who were gone.  Practice went pretty well, although we had to go over some stuff that the jv-band guys didn't know, or stuff like Obsession, which the varsity people didn't know.  I was actually kind of surprised, because although I know that these guys are really good musicians, but they caught on really well.  Of course things were different because Bobby and Scott weren't there and all that, but everything flowed actually better than I thought, though I'm a little sad to say I may have underestimated the younger guys.  They really did well.    As I get better at keys, I find myself wishing I had a really good keyboard.  I mean, the one I play is fine, but the keys aren't weighted, and I don't care what people say-- the pedal does nothing !!  It's really nice to feel more confident in my playing, though.  It probably doesn't show that I feel better when I play, but I notice it.  Every weekend I'm less afraid to try something I don't always do.  Every weekend I'm less concerned when I make a mistake.  This weekend, Michael asked me to keep playing some piano stuff during Obsession, which was unusually fine....typically I'm like, sitting there, trying not to panic, but it was fine, once I knew what he was talking about.  The more I play, the more I really enjoy doing it.  It makes me "step out of my comfort zone," as so many people are prone to saying.    However, I think that that phrase is rather erroneously stated.  You see, I've been playing keys for a couple of years now, and most of that time has been spent being encouraged by others to let God cultivate some kind of gifting, which I have done.  Each weekend, God gives me a little bit of something that I never had before, and I can't really explain what that's like, but it's as though he's giving me the pieces of a puzzle, which, once I accumulate the right pieces, I can put together quite easily.  So each weekend, if he gives me something, I don't just sit there and brood about it--I try to use it.  That is supposed to be "stepping out of my comfort zone."    But I'm not so sure about that.  I mean, if you think about think about it, we never really leave our comfort zones.  For a Christian, when we are saved, our best and most reliable comfort zone is automatically God, because of the new life and outlook on that life that he gives us.  So we're saved, and after we've gained a bit of understanding of what this new life is, we start to share it with others in many ways.  These are ministries.  So if you're in a ministry, such as worship, there will be times when God asks you to do something you're not quite sure you have the resources to do--something you're not quite  comfortable  doing.  When God tells me to do something on keys, sometimes it's easy and almost entirely effortless.  And there are times when what he wants isn't what I would really like to do.  So I might hesitate, but eventually, I will do it--I feel like I'm standing on a diving board and God's asking me to jump in.  Eventually, though it may be rather grudgingly, I will lift one foot off the board, lean forward, close my eyes, and jump--well, ok, maybe just step off.  But the anticipation of the water, the fear of not feeling something solid beneath me only lasts a few seconds, and then, quite a bit more suddenly than I anticipated, I'm in the water, in one piece and thinking I was an idiot for fearing such a small thing.    That's what I sometimes feel like when I do something God wants.  But when I think about it, I never stepped  out  of my comfort zone, I  expanded  it.  I didn't step out of this nice, warm, safe comfort zone into this harsh, cold, unforgiving world of doing God's will.  It's not like that.  I took the step, yes, and it was temporarily scary, but when I hit the water, I realized that I was comfortable there.  In the same way, if we take a step out into God's will, he won't leave us there alone, scared, and unarmed--he is with us every step of the way, and therefore, this new place is actually not so very unlike the one we just left.  The discomfort we felt before was our blindness to the fact that our original comfort zone--God--never leaves us, nor does he shove us into doing these things without his help.  He's with us every step of the way, and our huge, terrifying leap out of our wills is really just a small hop into another realm of God's will and his love for us--that original comfort zone.  ~Erika <>

       Wonders Never Cease...and Neither Will Stupidity   "CHARLESTON, West Virginia (AP) -- An inmate who was stuck for four hours with his head and one shoulder through a cell window has been charged with felony escape.   Robert Anthony Hill, 25, used a metal shelf to smash through the 6-inch-wide, 3-foot-long window at South Central Regional Jail on Monday, authorities said.   Rescuers spent four hours cutting out the window frame and several blocks to free the prisoner. He was not seriously injured.   Hill, who was charged Tuesday, faces five years in prison if convicted. He has been in jail since August on a parole violation after being charged with robbery and testing positive for drug use.   He has previously served time for robbery, carrying a concealed weapon without a permit and joyriding.   Authorities also were investigating whether other inmates tried to help Hill escape by slamming their lunch trays to mask the sound of breaking glass, said Steve Canterbury, executive director of the Regional Jail & Correctional Facility Authority."  Smooth, dude, very smooth.  Ok, this guy is trying to break out of jail and gets stuck in the window.  Ya know, maybe it's just me, but I think if I were going to try to break out by climbing out the window I might--just might--see if  perhaps  said window was large enough to accomodate my HEAD!  Call me crazy, but that just seems like common sense.  After reading this, I wonder two things: One, how ridiculous did this guy feel, realizing he's half in, half out of this window and he can't move?; two, how much did the guards laugh at him as they stood there, watching him perhaps trying to struggle in or out?    A line from The Kid comes to mind: "That makes you a stoooopid man.  A  very  stoooopid man."  ~Erika <>

       Valentine's Day   Alright, personally, I mostly despise Valentine's Day.  The only time I used to like it was when I was little and I would come downstairs and my mom would have a little box of those wicked awesome candy hearts waiting for me.  Yeah, I don't get those anymore--for some reason, those disappeared somewhat simultaneously with my abrupt atheism concerning Santa, the Easter Bunny, and the Toothfairy occurred.  Why the candy hearts, though?  I always knew my mother got them for me--how does that cause some kind of change??  Anyway, we were talking last night and she laughed and said she'd get me some this year--what a twisted world we live in when you have to lecture your own mother about how she's robbed you of childlike joy when she started denying you candy hearts every Valentine's Day.  (I thought I'd interject here that if Freud were still alive and he read this, he'd most likely say that all my future/present emotional/psychological problems are due to my heartbreaking denial of candy hearts...hm.)  Well actually, that's not why I mostly despise Valentine's Day, I just thought I'd throw that in there.  The real reason is because typically I'm fine with the fact that I'm single, have been my entire life (unless you count my "going out" with a guy for six days at the end of sixth grade.  Sheesh.), and the fact that I'm sixteen (almost seventeen) and never been kissed.  Every other day of the year, it's usually ok with me--hey, I'm fine, I enjoy singlehood or whatever it's called.  Until February 14th rolls around.  Stores have the audacity to put out Valentine's crap right after they pack away all the Christmas stuff!  So this is the one time of year where your nose is rubbed in the fact that you're single.  How nice.  And the fact that my mother is in a hideously good mood. Probably because she has a significant other.  Whom she has a date with to her favorite sushi place of all time in Denver.  (And I have no idea if the word "whom" was used in the correct context just now, because although I've sat through endless grammar classes, I've never grasped the concept of "who" and "whom" usage.  If anyone has it figured out, please leave me a message in the comment section.  Thank you.)  And why do some relentlessly cruel people choose Valentine's Day to break up with their significant others?  That is so mean!  I've so many people who have told me someone broke up with them on Valentine's Day--man, can we get a little more sadistic?  At least I can say no one's ever dumped me on Valentine's Day...so I guess I could have it worse.    Oh, and by the way--guys, if you are buying someone something for Valentine's Day, please remember to  take the price tag off!   I have to tell this story because I think of it every Valentine's Day and it makes me laugh: in eighth grade, my friend Denise was going out with this guy named Joey.  Everything was fine, and although I personally thought he was a sociopath, I, as well as the group of people Denise and I hung out with, supported them going out.  Ha.  So on Valentine's Day, Joey came up to her and gave her this gift bag thing, and when he walked away, she opened it.  A chocolate rose and a silver necklace with this little crystal-studded heart-shaped charm on it.  Sweet.  So her first words are, "I wonder if it's real!"  All of us knew it wasn't, but we left Denise to her delusions of grandeur and her eutopic Cloud Nine for the rest of the day until I, the Genius, had to open my mouth and say, "Can I see the boxthe necklace came in?"  I take the box, flip it over, and on the bottom is the unmistakable price tag which said, "$5.00."  I tried to take the tag off before she saw it, but too late.  Oh well, she still thought it was cute regardless (and I mean, hey, it's eighth grade, do you think he was gonna buy her this platinum and diamond-crested article of jewelry??).    So anyway, two days later, she comes to me, sobbing, and chokes out, "Joey...(sniffle)...he...(wracking sob)... dumped me!! "  Of course, we all comforted her, yada yada, and then the next day she transitioned from her brokenhearted stage to her raging, furious, vindictive stage.  (They only went out for like a week and a half, but maybe she thought he was The One...whatever.)  So she took the chocolate rose (which she had simply  refused  to eat, plucked the chocolate part off, and shoved the barren stem into his locker, which he never locked.  (It was Calhan Middle School--stealing??  Who steals in Calhan?)  Along with the stem, she hung his necklace and a note which I never really saw, but knew the words, "five-dollar piece of crap" were vehemently enscribed upon it.  Ah...young love.     Anyway, I just thought I'd put all that out there because I find it highly amusing.  And hey, Jaime and I are getting each other chocolates, and my mom's getting me my long-sought-after candy hearts.  Although I do think it's a little sad when you have your mother and best friend as your only consolation, but whatever, I'll take what I can get--single life is still good.  Happy Valentine's Day!!  ~Erika <>

       Worship Styles--Including Guys Jumping Off Chairs   Worship: to regard with ardent or adoring esteem or devotion.  I guess blogs are useful because it gives you an outlet in which to talk about things you wouldn't just get up and shout from the mountaintops.  I've been thinking a lot about worship, and how different people portray it.  For instance, a certain guy on the worship team is really into getting onstage and telling people that if they're not jumping around, then why are they there?, you need to give God your all, etc.  Pretty much this blog entry is a gripe.  Bear with me--I have a lot of scattered thoughts I'm trying to form into one point here.  Although I wholeheartedly agree that when you're worshiping you should give your all for God, I disagree about the worship statements written above.  When I wasn't on the worship team, I would be in the congregation towards the front.  That's where I always was.  Then I started thinking/praying about it, and I realized that the only reason why I was up front was because I felt like I should be.  It wasn't because I wanted to worship God up front, it was because I thought people would think that maybe I was "ashamed" if I worshiped in the back.  From that point on, I did worship in the back of the sanctuary with no guilt.  In fact, it made my time with God more intimate because there was no one around me, and I could just focus on Him, not what other people were seeing me do.    I think that everyone has their different way of worshiping their creator, and I don't think there is necessarily a right or wrong way, as long as you're doing what you feel God is wanting you to do.  I for one am not big on jumping during worship.  When I do devos at home, I jump sometimes, but for the most part, while I jump and dance or whatever in God's presence occasionally, it's not always my "style."  However, just because I'm not hopping around does not mean that my time with God is not sincere, and does not prove that He's not speaking to me at that time, nor does it mean that I am ashamed of Him.  I get really sick of comments made by people, referring that your physical activity during praise is a monument to how much God is talking to you, moving you.    Does it really matter whether you flail madly during praise or stand still, hands in your pockets, staring straight ahead?  I don't think so.  I don't have anything against people whose styles lean towards jumping around.  However, someone standing still could be having a more intimate experience with God at that time than the person screaming or jumping off chairs.  (And yes, I do remember someone who jumped off of chairs during worship and nearly landed on me.  I'm not writing this out of a personal vendetta though, just in case you were thinking, 'Ah-HA!  Now I see why she feels so strongly about this!'.)  Does it really matter if, during a slow song, you are on your knees, your face, standing, sitting, hands lifted, arms down, eyes open or closed?  I doubt it.  I think the only thing that matters is your focus on the one who calls you His own.    If you have to jump, sit, cry, whatever to achieve that zone of intimacy with God, you go ahead.  But I really can't stand when people tell the entire congregation that you need to jump to show your worship to God.  It's not a matter of what you look like when you're worshiping, because your outward presentation is a performance of emotion entirely.  Think about it: do you ever start praising God and you just can't sit still, so you get up and dance around or something?  It's because you can't contain how God's presence is making you feel.  Sometimes His presence hits you so hard you start crying.  But not everyone reacts the same way to God's power, you see.    Our outward expression is what we do because we love God and it's what we feel like doing for Him.  If you're not raising your hands because it's not what you feel like doing for God, then don't!  We shouldn't have to put on a show to let people know where we are with God, because the truth is, it's none of their business.  This is probably why the Bible talks about praying and stuff behind closed doors with the windows shut--because that way you're praying and worshiping just one-on-one with God, and not with anyone else.  Your time with God is your time with God, whether you do it in your bedroom, the shower, in a sanctuary, in the car, whatever.    My point is, I wish people would stop trying to pressure the congregation into showing the worship leader or whoever what he/she wants to see the congregation doing.  As a worshiper on a worship team, yeah, it's great to look up and see people raising their hands, jumping around, getting excited for God, but that's not what it's about.  It would mean so much more to hear that somebody came up to someone on the team and said, "Hey, thanks for doing worship, I really spent some great time with God tonight."  I feel that way because I'm on the worship team because I love ministering worship to people.  And worship is so much more than just an outward appearance, it's a way to for us to be with God through music.   I guess what I'm really trying to say is, if you want to kneel, kneel to God; if you want to sing, sing to God; and if you want to dance in worship, dance for God, not for who may be watching.  ~Erika <>

       Quandaries   Ok, I was watching my Bible class today (since I'm homeschooled under Abeka, I'm supposed to take a Bible class--the semester, it's "New Testament: Jesus and His Followers"), and the lesson was about the crucifixion of Jesus, and the different events that took place before it.  Typically, when I think of Jesus, I think about him in a more "today" point of perspective, not so much of him during the Bible days.  However, I've been thinking about him as more of the Biblical figure lately, due in majority to the fact that Easter is coming up, and so is The Passion of Christ or whatever it's called.  This time of year always makes me think of what Jesus did for us.    So in thinking of Jesus, and how he was when he walked this earth, I wondered what kind of person I would have been if I had lived where he did miracles and stuff when he did them.  Would I have been one of the women he healed or saved, or one of the Pharisees who hated him?  A Roman soldier who helped whip/beat/crucify him and cast lots for his robe?   If you think about it and are honest with yourself, would you be the kind of person who just worshiped at his feet?  Because really, in those days, he was kind of a freak.  People just didn't go around raising people from the dead and calling the Pharisees "you pit of vipers" on an everyday basis then, you know?  How do you react when you see a radical on the street or some punk with like twenty piercings (and those are only the ones visible to you at the time) and covered in tattoos?  Or some gross, drunk, homeless man on the street who'd just as soon murder you for one good meal as look at you?    If I had lived where Jesus had, and had been living a life full of sin, I don't know that I would have loved him unless he personally changed my life.  I think I would have thought he was a total freak, scoffed at him with my friends as he walked by, and, more to the point, judged him before I really knew him.  Then maybe--just maybe--when I saw him on the cross, I would have been moved.  Maybe not.  Maybe I would have been one of the Roman soldiers who, even though they were so close to his cross, were too busy seeing if they could win his clothing by luck rather than look at the One who the clothes belonged to.  So close, and yet too preoccupied with trivial matters to see what he was doing for them--the anguish he suffered, the loneliness he must've felt, knowing his father had forsaken him, the humiliation of being on that cross, but the joy of knowing what freedom we all would have the opportunity to experience as soon as it was all over with.    Thinking of this reminds me of one of my all-time favorite songwriters and singers, Nichole Nordeman.  There's a song she wrote called "Wide Eyed," and since it's such a long song, I'll just write part of it:  "Not so long ago, a man from Galilee Fed thousands with his bread and his theology And the truth he spoke quickly became the joke  Of educated, self-inflated Pharisees like me  And they were wide-eyed in disbelief and disillusion They were tongue-tied, drawn by their conclusions Would I have turned and walked away And laughed at what he had to say And casually dismissed him as a fraud Unaware that I was staring at the image of my God"  Which part would you play?  ~Erika <>

       More on Worship    To James: I really learned so much from your post on Fusion Worship--thank you for the enlightenment.   To Michael: I had to read your post a few times through to fully grasp what you were saying, but I get it now. Our opinions differ a bit, but probably because I've never led worship, and you're right--I don't know what it's like, nor do I profess to.   I think in my Worship Styles post I got a little off-track. Just to clarify, when I was talking about how it bothers me when worship leaders say, "If you're not jumping, then what are you here for?", I don't think that that's necessarily wrong, depending on the circumstances. Due to both James's and Michael's blogs, I understand better why worship leaders do that. When I wrote that post, I was writing strictly from the point of view of someone who has never led worship and probably never will--to my knowledge, that's not my calling.   As far as worship leaders go, I think what I was trying to say was this: sometimes they come off as a little negative/condemning. Like James said, there's a difference between pressure and encouragement. I suppose to me, when I know I am very much in God's presence, hearing someone say stuff that sounds a bit harsh seems well--a bit harsh, because I  was  participating. I do see more how it must be really frustrating when the congregation is not "getting into it," and that yes, sometimes some less than gentle words should be spoken. When I wrote that post, I wasn't writing to say, "If you say that stuff right now, you're wrong," or "If you said that stuff three months ago, you're wrong." My post was not focused on one time period. Just period.   In my opinion, as well as others' I've spoken to, it seems that when worship leaders lead, they lead us all into the very throne room of God by way of music. (That is, of course, if we're all willing to follow him/her there.) However (and correct me if I'm wrong), shouldn't it be up to God, who knows all hearts, what we do once we arrive there? If a worship leader says, "Ok, everyone, start jumping now!" how could they be sure that jumping is everyone's sacrifice to God? For me, sometimes it definitely is, but sometimes, it's equally as sacrificial for me to stand still and listen, even though everyone around me is jumping and stuff. Please don't think I'm saying that worship leaders should never encourage their congregants to do whatever God's will is--hey, it's not like I always know what that is, so you know...--I was just saying that sometimes leaders can come off as a little edgier than maybe they might mean to. A few weeks ago, Pastor Rick talked about how sometimes people get offended when he starts talking about something that means a lot to him. The reason why is because he gets carried away by his passion for that subject. That's exactly what I'm talking about. As a congregant and someone who doesn't lead worship, my point is, to all worship leaders who read this, by all means, encourage, but just be careful that your passion and your heart for worship doesn't come out as more forceful than is necessary. (Wow, did I use enough commas in that sentence??)   I hope I didn't offend anyone (by my passion for this subject, hahaha!), and as I have soaked up what I've read from others, I hope other worship leaders understand this more. Because all the other musicians/singers and I are not worship leaders, we try to do our best to follow you. You are our leader, and we will go anywhere you lead us. Thankfully, no matter what anyone says in the microphone or whether we jump or be still, by your willingness to let God flow through you, in our following you, we will never fail to end up directly before the feet of our Savior. To the worship leaders--thank you for your obedience to God, for without it, our journey from our flustered mental states into the very essence of God would be so very blind.   ~Erika <>

       Immaturity    I strongly disagree with people who think that maturity should come with age.  Personally, there have been times where circumstances in life have forced me to grow up rather more quickly than the natural progression of time would have.  Other times, or in other situations I might say, I am such a little kid still.  Allow me to deconstruct:  1.  While working in the Buckle, we have to offer registration, primo cards, and the Buckle charge card.  This very middle-aged man was buying some shoes for his wife, and when he snapped at me, declining each offer I told him about, I smiled at him, politely said, "Ok, that's fine," and read him his total.  In my mind, though, I had a sudden urge to stomp off and sulk.    2.  When Jaime and I came home (well, my full-time home, Jaime's part-time home) on Saturday night, I got out of the car to open the garage door and found that our psychopathic barn cat, Romo, had left the bottom half of a mouse to greet me.  Um, ew.  (I swear, that cat is the reincarnation of Jeffrey Dahmer.  When he hunts [i.e. brutally murders] his prey [i.e. victims], he leaves them for us, but in such a calculating way that it scares me.  Sometimes he'll kill a mouse and leave it face-down, and when you flip it over out of morbid curiosity, you'll see that all the insides are gone and the mouse is competely deflated.  Feline freak.)  Anyway, so I see this mouse, and I notice Romo haunting nearby, as if he's waiting to see my reaction.  My mouth drops open and I look at Jaime in the car, then to Romo (I'm telling you, he was psychotically smiling), then back at the mouse.  My first instinct was to kick the cat, then to bury the mouse.  Yes, I did say 'bury the mouse.'    3.  My dad was on TDY for work this week, and my mom and I watched Cold Creek Manor together, in which a guy is stalking this couple with a mallet used for when his dad used to kill sheep with it.  Or something like that.  So I'm a total wimp anyway, and even though the movie really wasn't that scary, just kind of creepy, I was really not wanting to go outside to bring the dogs in.  I mean, really  really  not wanting to go.  Like as if some mad murderer was lurking right outside the front door, waiting to bash my brains in with a mallet-sheep-killing-thing.  Last I checked, the only mad murderer outside my front door is my Jeffery-Dahmer-so-called-cat.  Go figure.  Not only do I have to steel my nerves before opening the door, I actually run--not walk--back inside and slam/lock the door.    4.  I often have the habit of laughing at inappropriate times.  When I was little, my mom would get mad at me and threaten me--you know, getting spanked, beheaded, disemboweled--the usual.  So when she would start on that, there was just something in me (probably Satan) that made me start cracking up.  It didn't matter what she said, I could not stop laughing.  Even now, when she gets mad at me, I have to fight the urge to burst out laughing.  Or sometimes in a movie when someone dies some horrible, awful death by flailing down a flight of stairs or something I can't help laughing.  Or when Jaime spends the night or something and we're like, "Ok, we're going to sleep now," and say goodnight, the lights are out and it's totally silent--and I start cracking up.    5.  I hate spiders.  I don't know why.  The word 'phobia' is described as something like 'an irrational fear of something that compels one to avoid it, even with the knowledge that the thing is not dangerous.'  I suppose you could say I am mildly phobic of spiders if you must use that word.  I have never been traumatized by a spider, and if it's a tiny one, I can usually kill it myself.  But there's just something about the way they move that totally freaks me out--therefore, if I see a big one in my room, my immediate response is to jump, shriek, and start dancing uncertainly on the spot where I stand.  Then I start screeching, "DAAAAD!!!  EWW, A SPIDER!!!  DAAAAAD, KILL IT!!"  It doesn't matter how much older I get, I will always be scared/grossed out by spiders.  This is how I've been ever since I was little, although now I don't actually start screaming and crying.    6.  Christmas Eve is still the most exciting thing for me, ever.  I don't care what happens, Christmas Eve is always exciting.  Ever since I can remember, I've spent every Christmas Eve tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep because the curiosity of what could be under the tree is just constantly jabbing at the edge of my mind.  I tell no lie--even now, almost seventeen years old, completely in disbelief of Santa, and knowing fully well that we have no chimney for him to squeeze down even if I did believe in him, I still hallucinate reindeer hooves on our roof.  I still also have to push back the instinct to ask if we could make cookies to leave for him.  Not that it would matter, since if we did, the selfish teenager in me would eat all the dough before it even hit the cookie sheet.  7.  Ever since I had teeth, I put off flossing until like the day before I went to the dentist (as if the dentist could never in a million years tell that my teeth had just been flossed the night before).  Now, since I'm older and ever so much smarter and more intelligent, I have upped my time before the dentist to a whole--count them, now-- seven  days before the dentist.  I have a week before my next appointment, and guess who's flossing tonight before going to bed?  Guess who hasn't flossed consecutively for the last four months?  So yeah, that's me, the girl a lot of people think is really smart.  Ha.  If you are one of these people, please re-read the section on my fear of mad murderers outside my front door.  Man or cat.  Doesn't matter.  Yes, so anyway, I had fun writing this anyway, so I don't care if it makes me sound really stupid.  I'm remembering happy childhood memories as I type and really trying to remember this book I read once as a little kid--something about a Mrs. Swamp or something.  When I remember the name, I'm going to find it and read it again.  I suggest everyone find a childhood book and re-read it, even if the sentences only consist of three words.  I think the only way someone truly gets old is if they lose the "immaturity" that sometimes makes life worth living.  ~Erika <>  PS- Michael, I just thought I'd tell you that the words "childish and immature" were laughingly floating through my head during the entire process of writing this blog entry.  To all of you who know me pretty well (that's you, Jaime, Michael, and Vicky), I ask you to please refrain from filling my comment block with certain conversations or actions I have engaged in that bear resemblance of something a little different from childhood innocence.  I believe it would severely diminish the sentimental revelry I am currently floating around in at this point in time.  ;o)  PPS- Does anyone besides me remember when if you disagreed with someone, you said, "Nuh-uh!", and they'd reply with, "Yah-huh!"  Or "I know you are, but what am I?"  Or "I am rubber, you are glue...etc."  Please tell me all of us 1987-ers remember that!

      Ok, I don't know if anyone else will find this funny, but I read this guy's blog, and this particular post totally cracked me up:   Got Advertising Rants?   by Kaya   I think we can all agree that it is no longer an effective marketing strategy to mimic the successful Got Milk? ads. Please -- can we agree to stop copying this tagline? The once proud and mighty Got Milk? slogan has lost its steam. It served its purpose, now its time to let it take its natural course. Much like the wave at sporting events or Dan Aykroyd, its time to put it to sleep and out of misery.   Aside from the grammatical error in the Got Milk? slogan, it is a brilliant ad campaign (and, lets face it, Do You Have Milk? sounds stupid and doesnt fit easily on a black t-shirt). Each advertisement was expertly executed and I imagine its one of the most recognized marketing runs of all time. But I have a questiondid anyone really buy more milk due to this multi-million dollar ad buy? Isnt milk one of those things you either use or dont use?   If they advertised heavily for the use of salt or butter (not a particular brand, but the substance unto itself) would you use more of it? Maybe its because I drink soy milk (and feel that Got Phlegm? is a more appropriate tagline despite what the focus group say) that this drink milkany milk at all strategy doesnt make sense to me. Everyone knows milk is supposed to be good for you (notwithstanding several studies raising points to the contrary), so how does this ad make you desire more milk in your diet? Does anyone say, This ad really spoke to me. I think Ill start pouring milk on my cereal in the mornings instead of beer or grenadine. Or Dunking these freshly baked chocolate chip cookies into mugs filled with sand isnt hitting the spothey, do we got milk?  Perhaps the worst result from these successful dairy spots was the copycat ads. Usually in the form of a local business or small company, the Got _____? text appeared to be everywhere. Got Life Insurance?, Got Bagels?, Got Estate Planning? I even saw printed on the window of a car Got Good Grades? as a promotion for a tutoring service. No, I dont got good grades -- my tutor cant write a sentence correctly.   I cant count how many times I saw this clever copywriting piggyback being done, however, I knew it was truly over when I saw a sign that read Got Smoked Fish?  Yep. The official end. Like when Bob Saget began to wear a goatee, thus signaling it was no longer cool (and perhaps one of the signs of the apocalypse), the Got Smoked Fish? slogan is the checkered flag, the rolling credits and the final bow to this once successful tagline.   Rest in peace little fella. May your message of strong bones and sturdy teeth help you where you go next. Say hello to the surly Wheres the Beef? lady and the poor Ive Fallen and I Cant Get Up. woman. I hope you got life insurance before it was too late. Godspeed.

       Update   I just thought I'd write a blog entry about last week, which Jaime was here for.  People keep asking how it was, did we have fun, etc., so I thought I'd just let you know how it was.    Two times we went out between 9:30 and 10 p.m. to rent movies from Blockbuster.  The second rental we got for free because the cashier was a flirtatious dork...oh well, hey, saved us some money.    We never got into a fight, but we always tend to be kind of rude to each other...go figure.  We watched the O.C. together.  If you don't watch it, there's one guy who's like in high school who's sleeping with his ex-girlfriend's mother.  Ugh.  We were both really grossed out, but Jaime had a spaz attack over it.   J: What? What??  What???   What??  WHAT??    WHAT????  M: (slow, annoyed glare) Shut up! J: (blinks) What?  We also tended to vow to go to bed early(ish) and actually go to sleep when we got into bed.   M: Goodnight. J: Goodnight. M: (stifling laughter) J: (stifling laughter) M: (cracking up) J: (cracking up) Typically that's when we started quoting movies and wound up staying awake for a couple more hours.    We also, much to certain peoples' disbelief, worked out every day (with the exception of the day that I was working, during which Jaime worked out without me).  Then we typically did Pilates dvd's and then watched Y&R (The Young and the Restless, our soap).  We ran a half a mile the first day, increasing distance over the span of days to eventually wind up running a full mile the last day.   First Day after 1/4 of a mile: M: (panting and wheezing) Ok, I'm really out of shape. (pant) I'm gonna die. J: (gasping desperately for breath) You know, it really wasn't that bad (wheeze). M: (heaving for air) Yeah, I think we did pretty good! J: (breathing slowly returning to normal) Yeah, I'm proud of us! M: I agree.  Ok, let's go watch Y&R.   On the last day, we did a train on the last lap.  A train is where everyone runs in a single file line, and the last person sprints to the front of the line and is then the leader.  The person who is now on the end sprints forward and is then the leader, etc.  This continues for however long you want.  In our case, we decided to do a train the last 1/4 mile.  Apparently we're a little more competitive with each other than we thought.   Last Day--I start, Jaime right behind me: M: (lightly jogging) J: (runs in front of me and smiles as she passes me) This continues for some time, and then towards the end: M: (bolting to get ahead of her) J: (sprinting furiously to get ahead of me) M: (trying to run faster than her and quickly...ish...dismissing thoughts of giving her a playful, sportsmanlike push off the road) J: (refusing to let me get ahead of her) We wound up sprinting side by side for the last part because neither was willing to get behind the other without a fight.  When we were done and starting the cool down: M: Well that wasn't so bad. J: Nah. M: You were totally trying to beat me. J: Yeah, I was like, 'There's NO WAY she's getting ahead of me this time!' M: Haha, me too. J: Yeah, haha. (silence) M: So...I think we should watch Y&R before we do Pilates, what do you think? J: Definitely.  Anyway, so there's our time together, minus all the late-night laughing and movie-quoting, gripes about Pilates-induced agony and pedicures at night in silence (so what if we screamed because some random object behind us fell on the floor and we might as well have been convinced that it was the ghost of Madison Elizabeth Frank from What Lies Beneath?).  Yeah, we're pretty dumb, but hey, we still had fun.  ~Erika <>

       Small Towns   Alright, you know, I live kind of between Calhan and Falcon, but not exactly  in  either town.  I've noticed that in spite of the fact that subdivisions are piling up out here and they're building more stores, shopping centers, etc., the small town mentality is still running strong for some of these people.  Examples:  (A) I walk into Safeway after work one day to get a Starbucks, wearing a skirt.  It's not like it was dressy or anything, just a black skirt and a t-shirt with flip-flops.  I walk in and people actually  stopped  what they were doing to gape at me.  Good Lord, are these people so used to cowboy boots and flannel plaid button-down shirts that I nearly cause a pall in business simply for walking into the freakin' Safeway for an iced mocha while wearing a skirt??  (B)  So I'm driving home, and on Judge Orr Rd., there are a ton of barbed-wire fences, as nearly everyone out here owns at least 20 acres of land.  Apparently the native Calhan/Falcon residents find it quite the festive tradition to string what looks like rolls of pink, yellow, and white paper through barbed-wire fences.  What??  Next thing I know they'll be conducting Easter egg hunts for their children by hiding plastic eggs in roadkill carcasses!  Well anyway, enough of that...have a happy Easter, everybody, and please only ever look for Easter eggs hidden in trees and hedges.  ~Erika <>

       Celebrities and Christianity   I've been thinking about something that I heard on some show on E!, and the commentator of the show said something like, "People don't really care about a celebrity's career, what they all really want to know about is the star's personal life."  For some reason, that popped into my head a couple of days ago, and I think that that statement radiates a lot where our roles as Christians in this world are concerned.    Has anyone noticed that no one really cares about Michael Jackson's career anymore?  All the newspapers talk about is his involvement with children, trials, and scandals--not his latest cd or newest dance moves.  Paris Hilton is mostly famous not because she's a beautiful heiress, but because of her appearances at wild parties and in porn videos.  When Janet Jackson caused such a scandal at the Superbowl, it was not because what happened involved  her , but because of what her motives might have been.  Bill Clinton--quick, think!--when you read his name, did you just think of his stigmatic involvement with Monica Lewinsky?  That particular event had nothing to do with his ability to lead our country, but what kind of a person he was.  People thought, "What kind of a president do we have?  How can a man that immoral really be in any kind of shape to direct this nation??", when in reality, how many people have been involved in acts of adultery?  The statistic would be innumerable.    The media focuses on a celebrity's personal life, emotions, and activities because in such an Americanized and godless culture, the public still yearns for an ability to relate to that celebrity.  If you hear a great song on the radio, you listen for the artist's name, look for the cd, buy it, love the music, and then what?  You listen to his music with great interest, look at the face of the artist on the cd's sleeve, look for his name, read the lyrics he wrote.  If you are intrigued by what you hear, see, and read, you might just go online and look him up.  Why?  Because you want to know more about him  as a person.    America is filled with people searching for truth or reality (or something like it) by following the lives of those who are famous.  They  want   to reach out and be reached out to.  They search for beautiful, talented people who are in some ways like themselves so they feel a degree of closeness to an "idol," a "deity."    As much as the common man denies the existence of something higher than himself, he sure does treat other common men as such.  Oh, wait, I'm sorry, those other common men are "famous," they're "celebrities,"...my mistake, I apologize.   Other common men --perhaps the thought of loving a God, an entity high in the sky, is too much to handle and quite unreal or irrational, but the thought of loving and obsessing over another of the same species is much easier to swallow.  As humans, we crave company.  We are social creatures, of course with the exception of hermits and such.  Most people, even if they don't love being in a huge crowd, enjoy the company of a few close friends.  We all like to have friends, people we can relate to.  My point in processing this is that as Christians, what more do we need to show people how much God loves them?  Humans are reaching out to other humans to find a source of identity because they feel that they can't reach out to God, or that God doesn't want to or won't reach out to them.    Even if you don't speak to someone directly about God every day, there are always ways to show his love to them.  I'm not writing this to tell you all to get up and go scream to people on the sidewalk that "Jesus loves you!!", but to enlighten you to the fact that we all need to look at the normal, everyday people around us and see how much those who don't have God need him, and need to understand how all God wants is to have a loving, intimate, yet casual relationship with each and every one of us.  So many people, including many Christians, are ignorant to the fact that God took away that veil of separation and irreconciliation when he sent his son to die for us all.  Because of that, there's no reason to think that he's far from us--and that is exactly what this culture needs to know: God doesn't even want his people to treat him as so "untouchable" as a celebrity is, but only wants them to love him and crave knowledge of and friendship with him.  ~Erika <>

       Cancun   Ok, so Jaime beat me to it, but I'm writing a goodbye blog.  Each rainy/snowy day followed by a 70 degree day in the past two weeks has gotten to me so bad that I'm totally ready to get out of here and into some  real  spring weather.  Alright, so it'll be more like summer weather, but that's beside the point.  Anyway, I'm really excited cuz it's like the first time I've gotten to go anywhere besides a missions trip with my best friend--well we did go to Vail, but that was still rather domestic.    It's 8:59 this Friday morning, and I'm already packed.  This last day will be rather hectic for me because as soon as I'm done with this, I have to go feed our horses, get as much school done as I can before Necole Austin comes over to drop off my Mary Kay stuff, then do the rest of my school, and get ready for work.  I have to leave at noon, so I'm sure this morning will be hard-pressed for time but exhilarating all at once.  After work I go pick up Jaime, and then at 6:45 a.m. tomorrow, we will be Cancun-bound!    In any case, I'll leave all four or whatever it is of you guys to enjoy this rather irritatingly erratic Colorado weather.  If I can somehow work you guys into my mental processing between pedicures, tanning, daiquiri-drinking, and parasailing, I will surely miss you and think of you mournfully.  Oh, and then there's resting on hammocks, reading, listening to music, snorkeling, and massages.  Wait, yeah, I was saying...think of you mournfully.    Actually we will be missing two youth services and a church service, so that's kind of sad...sort of....--Wait, then there's the fact that we have no school, can get up at noon if we want--right, I will miss you all and while I am basking in the sun's heat on white, powder-fine sand, I will wish you were all there.    I love you guys!!  ~Erika <>  PS- By the way,  urlLink this  is where we'll be staying.

       Back from Cancun   Alright everybody, we're back from Cancun, and A) no, we didn't wind up on any Girls Gone Wild Videos, B) no, we did NOT tan topless, and C) yes, we did see VERY hairy men by the pool.  Ugh.    For those of you wondering, our trip was very good and very relaxing.  For the most part, our agenda went as follows:  My mom woke us up at about 10 a.m. We got up, threw on some clothes and makeup, and went to breakfast. We went back up the the room, changed into bathing suits, and went to the pool. I would tan and Jaime would lie in the shade, applying sunscreen every twenty minutes. We would get hot and get in the pool. Work Pilates into our schedule. Some days we had spa appointments, like massages, facials, and pedicures. Go up to the room and take a nap.   Get up and shower. Go down to dinner and get a drink from Manuel, the coolest bartender ever.  (He speaks Mexican AND Mayan--how awesome is that??) Go to bed.  James thinks I'm a loser for not blogging while I was down there, but honestly, looking at that action-packed schedule, how on earth could I possibly fit in the time??  Plus, I'm not really sure they had internet access.  Like I think the website said they did, but it was never mentioned to us, and I never saw any place to access.  Oh, and we went parasailing!  How cool is that?  We went up tandem, which means we went up together, which is good, because I'm not sure I could've done it by myself.  I didn't really let myself think about it because I knew I'd get all scared if I did, so I kind of blocked it out until we got on the Waverunner, it took us out to the boat, and we got harnessed onto the parachute.  Then I got scared.  They put me in front and Jaime behind me, so when we got up there, the ocean was   right there  .  It was so much fun though, because it was so quiet and serene--it seemed really surreal to me while I was up there because the ocean was so beautiful it almost looked fake.  I had my eyes closed for like the first five seconds, and Jaime was all psyched and saying, "Open your eyes, open your eyes!!" so I did and was amazed.  I guess I thought maybe the air/wind would make it really rough up there, but it was like floating.  I also thought we'd have to scream at each other to be heard, but there was total silence.  As soon as I relaxed, it was just unbelievable, and I'm so glad we did that.  I think we were probably about as high up as you are when you get to the top of the Mind Eraser at Elitches before the drop, and we were up there for about nine minutes (too short if you ask me).  I would do it again in half a heartbeat if I could.  The food there was really good, though I think we all thought the buffets at dinner were the best.  The first night we got there, we had a buffet, and they had these  awesome  desserts.  The rest of the dinners were from a menu, and the last night we had a Mayan/Mexican buffet, which was pretty interesting and really good.  They had all these food displays every night, and I think the coolest one was an alligator made of bread, which sounds dumb but actually was really cool (and James, I took a picture of it so you can see it).  The Mayan buffet had this donkey's head made out of various melon, and it looked really interesting to me, but Jaime didn't have her camera, so I didn't get a picture of it.  (Though she didn't really mind because it kind of scared her.)  The last day, we went snorkeling in Cozumel, which was definitely fun, although we did have to take a ferry across the way, and that was bad cuz the currents were really strong and I felt like I was gonna hurl.  When we got to the Cozumel pier, we walked to a glass-bottomed boat tour and got to go to three different snorkeling sites.  The first was really good with a lot of fish, but the second was even better because we got to see/hold sand dollars and this enormous starfish.  The guide would dive down and bring them up to us.  The third site Jaime will have to write about because by that point, since I don't think I had fully recovered from the ferry ride, I was feeling sick again and stayed in the boat.  Apparently there were some HUGE fish, like four-feet-long fish...the guide chased one under the boat so I could see it, which was cool.    We went shopping after snorkeling and Jaime and I got these really pretty silver rings and henna tattoos, which I think are really fun.  (Although since my tattoo is like this sun thing, and I haven't totally gotten used to it, I got in the bathtub today and for a fraction of a second had this panic cuz I forgot it was there and thought it was a spider or something.)    I'm seriously hating Colorado's weather, because it's really inhumane to have to come home from 80-degree-plus weather and then the next day be in nasty rainy/snowy crap like today had.  And now it's all sunny.  What is with this stupid weather??  Anyway, just thought I'd let you all know how Cancun was--we had a great time, and as sarcastic as my last blog sounded, you guys were actually missed.  Occasionally.  Between drinks and naps.  ~Erika <>

       Blogger: Fun to Play with, Not to Eat   Oooh, the new Blog system is fun to play with!  Alright, I know this is dumb, but when I wrote that, I automatically thought of the warning tagline for kids' stuff like Play-Dough, which is, "Fun to play with, not to eat."  So then I started thinking of stuff I played with when I was little.    The Best Stuff Ever 1)  Legos 2)  Those HUGE coloring books that were like half the size of my body when I was six 3)  The show "Under the Umbrella Tree" 4)  Silly Putty 5)  The pink Barbie Corvette 6)  Plastic picnic food...and yes, I did try to eat it 7)  Using blankets to make tents with various tall objects around the house 8)  Looney Tunes--the real ones, not the stupid ones they have now like the one of Tom and Jerry    when they were kids... what is that??  8)  Pounding random piano keys at my grandma's house and feeling quite certain I was a female Mozart 9)  Weebles!  Remember: Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down! 10) Those toy car things that were battery-powered--I never got one, and therefore felt rather deprived until I got a real car...I still think the toy ones are better though  Ok, so that was really fun cuz now I feel all nostalgic and stuff!  Anyway, don't know why I posted that, but it was fun, so I hope everyone who reads this takes a couple of minutes to relive childhood!  ~Erika <>

       Update   Please forgive the silence.  I don't have an imaginatively creative and clever excuse. My only lame excuse is, I've just had a total writer's block.  I've had nothing much of note to blog about, but since a few people have told me I need to blog, I suppose I should at least just put something out here.  Life has been relatively busy, which is how I like it.  It's easier for me to get some kind of routine going in my lifestyle when I have a lot to do, and I like routines in my life.    One of the biggest things I've seen people blog about and heard people talk about is the big stuff going on with the church division and concerning the youth ministry.  Really, everyone who's blogged about it has covered most of the high points that have been running through my mind.  To be honest, I am grateful for this change of pace.  I love the idea of change, but sometimes it's not in "my timing," therefore making it hard to adapt to.  However, this was not the case.  The only thing I was really upset about was the fact that a lot of people were hurt, and the youth ministry was noticeably diminished, especially considering how many people have graduated as well.  I am the kind of person who very quickly adapts to changes though, and I was thrilled when I heard that Roger and Rachel are the new youth pastors.  I know they'll do an amazing job, and if I'm telling the truth, I think Pastor Rick had taken us as a ministry as far as he could.  It was time for fresh wood to be thrown on the fire, and Roger and Rachel have it in mass.    I am really grateful for what Rick did in this ministry, after all, God used him to basically build it.  But that season is over, and I anticipate the future with excitement.  I was thinking to myself today that yeah, things are bound to be a little strained for a little while, but God didn't leave with Rick.  We're gonna be fine, and in moving on, people will heal as well as the ministry.  I say, let's put the past behind us and renew ourselves spiritually for what great things God has for us  now.   Ok, so for all these other people "covering all the high points," I guess I had some things to say anyway.  Well, all that aside, personally speaking, life is pretty good.  I've gotten to better know some people who I've been acquainted with for years, and I always think that's interesting.  Making new friends is always cool to me.  I've also, as Jaime wrote, been hanging out with her and Michael more, which is fun since we haven't really been able to do that for quite a while.  I've noticed a lot of things happening in various relationships, with many different people, that I find interesting because you can kind of see friendships and things forming that are more long-term, now that so many of us only have a year of high school left.  I can see in myself that my friends have become extremely important to me in the past half a year or so, and it's strange now to realize that this coming year is the last year I'll have in high school and as a legal minor.  In about 15 months, I'll be a freshmen in high school.  Even though I know it's not totally true, I can't help but feel that this last year is going to form who I'll be as an adult.  This last year means a lot to me, maybe because I know a lot of people will probably wind up leaving for college and things, and this last year might be the last year I have with them.    Yeah, all that sounds kind of sad, but that really just motivates me.  I mean, this last year counts for a lot for some reason, and I can tell that I'm really going to want to  make  it count, if that makes any sense.  Really I guess what I'm trying to say in this blog right now is that I'm really excited for the future, and what change has brought into it.  Even though change is somewhat unnerving at times, I feel that if we let that go to God and relax, he'll really take things to the next level, and we should be ready for what he's going to do in our ministry.  ~Erika <>

       Light at the End of the Tunnel    &nbsp; Hey guys, I guess I'm posting an update again, since it seems inevitable lately to post as often as I would like.&nbsp; A lot has happened recently, so here I go to write and&nbsp;most some&nbsp;of you of what you already know and inform some of you of things you didn't.  First of all, the most exciting thing has been the job I just got.&nbsp; I've been working at the Buckle for like the past four months or so, and whereas it was great in the beginning, lately my heart just hasn't been in it, and the paychecks have been inadequate.&nbsp; I've been hard-pressed in the past month to find anything good to say about my workplace, and that, to me, seems to indicate that burnout is swiftly approaching and a new job is imminent.&nbsp;   I started the job hunt about three weeks ago, and Sunday, Beauty Brands (a&nbsp;hair salon/spa/beauty supply store)&nbsp;called and requested an interview.&nbsp; I set it up for Monday, and got the job right away, which was a little surprising in the respect that the manager seemed to already have me in mind when I walked in the door.&nbsp; I have been praying for a job in retail because I like to work in social environments, that would pay a lot,&nbsp;that would give me many yet flexible hours, and would be for a company that cares for and takes care of its employees.&nbsp; This job gives me all of the above.&nbsp; It's not based on commission, so there's not the suffocating pressure to sell,  sell,  SELL  .&nbsp; It pays seven dollars an hour, and that's just the starting rate.&nbsp; She says she wants to give me as many hours as I want, and this coming Monday I start my first week that provides 22 hours, which is awesome.&nbsp; I don't have to work during youth or on Sundays at all except for maybe once every five or six weeks.&nbsp; They have really good benefits for full-timers, and as I'm part-time, I don't apply, but I do get a 35% discount on all products for me and my immediate family (yes Jaime, I am practically your sister, but I'm also&nbsp;a really bad liar) and 50% off all salon and spa services.&nbsp; So yeah, this place is gonna be great, and I'm really looking forward to it.  Aside from that, I got my piano tuned, finally, which is good because I haven't been able to touch it within the past few weeks considering how out of tune it's been.&nbsp; The first week of September, I'm going to be starting piano lessons again, because I really just can't self-teach the way some people can.&nbsp; I can get to a certain point, but I require some guidance because I have next to no knowledge of theory and I have a hard time pushing myself to play something I hate.&nbsp; With lessons I'll also have to play in recitals and things like that, which I'm not really looking forward to, but I know it'll be really beneficial.&nbsp;   Anyway, so that's the extent of what's been going on lately.&nbsp; My last day at the Buckle is tomorrow, 9-5, ugh, but it's the last time!&nbsp; Then Friday I'll probably be going to see The Manchurian Candidate, which I've been like dying to see since the first time I watched the trailer, and then next Friday I might be going to Elitches with a bunch of people, so that should be really fun!&nbsp; Pretty much, this summer is ending really well.  ~Erika <>
