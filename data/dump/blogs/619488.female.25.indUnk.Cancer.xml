      Wee!  My first post...  this has been such an ordeal...  i need to learn perl etc, cause i was SO CLOSE to running greymatter or movable type or one of those programs off of my site, but NO!!   (dammit)    I just couldn't get perl to work right...  well, neither could my incredibly smart hacker brother either...  so i'll just go with this web based prog for now...  Now i just need to figure out how to ftp to my own computer...   this shouldn't actually be too hard (oh God...  i just cursed myself)...  So, for now I will host it at blogspot...    Ugh...  late at night..  must work in AM...  must sleep...   Ali

      Just got back from seeing Spider-Man..  Loved it! :)  It was just a great movie...  action-packed and full of humor...  Tobey Maguire was excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-Man - he did a great job showing the outsider/geek side of Parker, which made the transformation into Spider-Man very satisfying...  The only thing that really stuck out in my mind as amiss about the movie was Kirsten Dunst.  I've seen her in other movies and she looks cute, but in this one, she just looked awful compared to her other appearences.  I don't know what it was... probably the red hair.  She doesn't have the coloring for it, but it was necessary for the role...  also, it looked like they rushed through makeup...  in a couple of shots her lipstick looked like it wasn't even covering all of her lips which made her lips look really small.  I felt bad for her, she's a cute girl and she looked sick in this movie.  I'd be pissed if I was her...   Maguire on the other hand...  He looked awesome :)  I heard he did a lot of preparation for the movie, and it shows ;)  Very cute...    So, it's been a spider day unfortunately...  in the car on the way to the movie, a spider freaking crawled on me!  I was so grossed out...  first, it was on my jeans and I freaked out and brushed it off...  and then I didn't see where it went, and then it was on my arm...  I freaked out and brushed it off again (then my brother killed it...  or he said he did)...  Then, after the movie on the way home there was one crawling on the outside of my window (eww)...  and then when we got home there was one dangling in the hallway outside of my room (eww)...  David killed those last two also... but, eww.  I hate spider days...  weird that there were so many on the day that we saw Spider-Man though...  and eww eww eww, i still can't believe there was one crawling all over me...  eww..  now every time I feel a little itch or anything I'm sure that there's a spider on me...  eww.

      I had to make a big decision last night:  Should I go see Spider-Man opening night at the local theater or wait for the next day to see it at Crossgates?  If I went last night I'd get the thrill of seeing it  opening night , but I'd have to go to the theater at Clifton Park Center, which sux.  If I waited until the next day, I could go to the big theater at Crossgates and see it on a better screen in stadium seats with digital sound.  So, it came to this: did I want to waste my first Spider-Man viewing at a sub-par theater?  The answer was no.  I'm going to go see it today at Crossgates.  I am dissappointed that I missed opening night (I love seeing a movie opening night, it's just so exciting), but I'll get to see it opening weekend at a great theater.  I think I made the right decision :)  (This post was a total parody of an 8th grade essay on a big decision...  although sadly the content was all true)

      I suck.  I went to work today and we started a new scoring project where you have to use the computers to score.  They gave us the usual examples of how we're supposed to score based on what the state that we're scoring for says and then sat us in front of the computers to take a test.  The test gave us responses to the questions that had already been scored, and we had to score them.  Our scores were supposed to match exactly with the state's scores at least 70% of the time.  Well, I failed the first one, but that wasn't too bad 'cause most of my group failed that one too.  But then I failed the second one, which pissed me off royally.  I mean, I really thought I was scoring right...  so they gave those of us that failed again one more chance...  and I failed  again .  I really really suck.  It was most embarrassing.  I had to leave work 2 hours early 'cause they didn't have any work for me, and now I don't know if they want me to come back Monday or not...  I have to call...  ugh.  With my luck today, I'm going to call and they're going to tell me not to bother.  :(  I suck.

      Blah...  I get a random day off, and it's raining...  SUX...  So, I work at this place through a temp company where we grade tests from all across the US, wherever they have a contract with at the moment.  The stuff we grade are essay questions from standardized tests that the kids really don't want to take...  well, we just finished up grading writing tests from a Western state yesterday and we are going to begin grading tests from a Southern state next...  They began grading Science today, but I'm not grading those, so I got the day off (which kinda sux)...  I go back tomorrow to start grading Social Studies...  kids write the funniest things, cause they're all in a hurry to get stuff down (they only have 45 minutes per essay) and so they never go back and read what they've written...  or sometimes, they're just so self-centered that they don't realize what they've written sounds weird or wrong....  here are a few examples:   "I don't give a flying Swahili Showgirl what they think"  "I am one of those people who would mentally die if..."  "... friends seem to be changed as often as your underwear..."  (an 8th grade girl on puberty)"...girls are mocked as their chest grows larger and their monthly cycle arrives.  Boys can be chastised for their voices getting deeper and other unmentionable things."  "If you are popular like me, it's a little easier to grow up"  "I decided that I would ask my parents that night after sucking up"  "It hurt, but it was so cute"  (an 8th grader)"I was a real idiot, back in 7th grade"  "My whole life has gone to poop"  "In short, I think this whole censorship thing is gay"  "Curfew: a nice way of saying I don't respect or trust your decisions."  These Western kids do some weird things too...  there was one kid who wrote that his favorite toy from when he was a kid was a steel rod that was expandable, and that he used to like to sleep with it but it had to be under the covers so that it didn't fall out of bed and he liked the way the cold steel felt against his naked thigh and he would wake up wanting ice cream...  then he went on to say that one time he went out to the barn and shoved it down a sheep's throat but then the sheep swallowed it and he was sad...  but a few days later his dad came in with the steel rod covered in poop saying that the sheep had passed it and the kid was so excited that he took the steel rod into the bathtub with him to clean it off and he scrubbed his rod real hard to get all of the poop off of it... and then he brought his rod to school with him but a bully took it from him and started probing sheep with it...  that was the most disturbing essay I read, it was by an 8th grader...  eww...  i've heard that like 10% of kids that grow up on a farm engage in some form of beastiality, and that's so gross...

      I'm a very passionate person...  unfortunately, my passion for any one thing only lasts as long as my attention span will allow...  and that's not long...  So far, I've been able to keep interested in my little site here for a week, and that's amazing.  Hopefully I'll be able to keep this up...  But normally, I don't last that long...  in fact, I didn't even last long enough to finish that post, because I flipped the channel and  urlLink Felicity  was on.  I haven't seen that show since the first or second season.  I loved the first season when Felicity was with Noel, but then she ended up with Ben, and I HATED it.  But this episode ended up with Felicity  traveling back in time  to be with Noel.  That rules.  I hope they don't screw it up now...

So, Michelle, Dave and I went to Crossgates and ate at  urlLink Houlihan's .  A few other people from our table were supposed to come also, but they never showed up :(  Anyway, had a good lunch, but then after I really wanted to play  urlLink DDR , and they have 5th mix in front of the theater there...  but i still can't play :(  I just want this ankle to feel better already!!  So we walked around the mall and didn't get anything...  I guess Dave was really bored... typical male :)   When I got home today my little brother, Greg, was down in the basement playing  urlLink DDR ...  and all I want to do is play!!  Ah well...

      Today sucked...  well, actually it wasn't that bad... I just wanted to go back to bed this morning, but I had to go to work...  then i left the house late and i got to work right at 8:00 when our manager-guy was giving a lecture on being prompt and working hard...  work went fast, which is a plus, but all day i was in a badish mood cause i had to go to the dentist right after work.  My appointment was for 4:30, and work only lets out at 4:00, so i had to speed all the way home and i made it to the dentist's office right before 4:30...  and then i had to wait for a half an hour.  That just sux.  And then, to top it all off, after i get in there he's trying to get a crown on, and it turns out that since he didn't put a temp crown on at my last appointment (when he kept grinding my GUM!) my teeth have moved and this crown was now useless.  So now i have to go back again for him to grind my teeth (GUM!) again and measure for another crown etc etc...  SUX!  But, after i got home i had chinese food (fortune: "your love of music will be an important part of your life") and Tim called and i felt all better...

      well, the boyfriend broke up with me (that's what the earlier post was all about).  I'm so sad...  i'm broken :(  we were going on 5 years together.   5 years   and i still love him so much.  this hurts.  a lot.  i don't really get what happened either...  we were good, i thought...  he broke up with me once before and we got back together.  last year right around this time (actually  right  about this time).  LIke, this could be like the 1 year anniversary of it.  Last year he said that he thought we weren't in love anymore and that we were growing apart and that we should take a brake...  he ended up calling me a week later and apologizing.  but this year...   it all started last night after the wedding (not ours.. our friends')...  everything went well at the wedding.  he looked sexy in his tuxedo and i looked pretty hot myself in a new dress and spiffy hair.  we had a good night...  we danced to the slow songs looking in eachother's eyes...  we were planning on doing something today...  but then when it was time to leave i asked him if he was coming over to my house, cause we hadn't been able to see eachother all week.  he said no 'cause he was just too hot and tired... and then i got depressed and made him feel bad about it.  i do - did - that too much.  when he couldn't come over, i'd make him feel bad, and that's really not nice.  of course, people tell me that he should want to come over more... but i think he does, he's just so busy.  ...anyway...  so after i got upset that he wasn't coming over, tim said that he'd been thinking about it for awhile, and he thought that we needed to take a brake from eachother...  this was at like 1230am in a mighty chilly, dark parking lot after we'd both been drinking at the reception.  i freaked out (a valid response) because i completely hadn't seen this coming...  he didn't want to talk about it so i asked him if i could meet him today in a neutral place to discuss.  he agreed...  i went home and cried myself to sleep  so today he called me around noon and we agreed to meet at 3pm at the Vischer Ferry Nature Preserve.  so we met there and Tim tried very sweetly to explain that he needed time for himself to figure himself out.  he said that he still loved me but that he thought that we could both benefit from some time apart.  I can't remember exactly everything that was said...  we haven't been able to see eachother very much lately (which was actually a major problem that led up to last year)...  Tim had a very hectic schedule with school and work and my work schedule is less than ideal in that i don't have any set pattern, i work when i get hours.  now tim is graduating and starting his new job working full-time nights and he doesn't think that we'll be able to see eachother at all...  i see his new schedule as an opportunity to see eachother more.... now he'll just be working instead of working  and  going to school...  i'll have to be doing both in the fall, but we will have time together... we'll have days off and weekends...  or we would.  and we were planning on moving in together, so we'd be seeing eachother more.  i just don't understand...  we'd been talking about it forever... he asked me to move in with him...  he told me on new year's that he was going to propose to me this year, and now he acts like he doesn't love me anymore...  he says he does, but he needs space.  he thinks the romance has gone from our relationship...  i don't think so.  i mean, we're not all over eachother all the time, but we have been together for over 4 years...  he wanted to hold my hand when we were walking, and at one point i referred to him not being my boyfriend anymore and he said he still was and when he left he hugged me and kissed my forehead....  so i'm confused.  i mean, if he's breaking up with me then he's not my boyfriend...  i still love him and still want him and still want him to be my boyfriend, but if he really doesn't feel the same way then there's nothing that i can do about it. Tim isn't happy with himself right now and he's nervous about starting a new job.  I asked him if I made him unhappy and he said no, so i don't understand how dumping me will make him happier with himself.  i guess i see his point about us not seeing eachother much, but i've always just known that it would get better someday, and i thought that with his new job it would get better soon...    also, we'd been doing so much planning about getting an apartment together... we'd been going out and shopping for our "10 dollar appliance of the week" and getting other assorted items for the apartment...  he hasn't said a thing about being unhappy.  this just all came so out of the blue, it's such a shock...  i feel like everything is falling apart...  i miss him already and i'm just  so  sad.  i thought that we shared the same vision of the future and now it's falling apart, and that's so scary...   all i want is to be with him.  he makes me happy, and i'm so sad so my first thought is to go to him, but he doesn't want me.  this hurts so much.  everything reminds me of him.  i look around my room and see the collage he made me of pictures of the two of us and our family and friends hanging above my bed, pictures of him on my wall, on my dresser, on my desk, all the pooh bears above my desk that we collected together, the stereo he gave me, my dresser that he stripped the white paint off and stained for me, my bed that he helped me put together (and, of course, there are other memories associated with that bed), even the shirt that i always wear to bed was Tim's...   everything  reminds me of him...  as if i need reminding... i'm always thinking of him.  i just don't know what i'm going to do...  i love him, and i don't want to lose him, but i guess i have.  i just saw a commercial on tv for the three diamond anniversary ring ("for the past, the present and the future") and i just started bawling all over again.  this hurts so  so  bad.

      my schedule for the fall looks pretty good...  I've signed up for 12 credits, and my classes are on Mon, Tues, and Wed evenings...  I can't wait to go back to school, all this free time is killing me...   I applied for the departmental secretary job at the hospital.  Hopefully, i'll get it...  they must not have had anybody apply for the job when they posted it in house a month ago cause it found its way into the paper, so i'll have an edge over outside applicants because I already work at the hospital...  it's full time first shift no weekends or holidays, and that would work out GREAT for my going to school...  when i student teach... well, that's a different story... but i won't mention the grad school thing in the interview...  i'll just screw 'em later....   *yawn* I'm "not needed" again tomorrow at the other job.  I wish they'd just tell me if they don't want me back ever, cause that's ok with me.  Why waste my time? unfortunately, i can't pick up any time at the hospital tomorrow, so it's just a lost day.  dammit.  the thing that sux the most about not working at the scoring place is missing the people who i worked with :(  we had fun...   i suck. maybe i sucked for a reason though, and i'll find a better job.  hopefully...  ah well...  enough worrying for tonight...

I'm thinking it's better for me not to waste my time going anymore and causing me all that stress and embarrassment (cause, i can't help it, i stress over it and get really embarrassed when i don't pass, and it only gets worse each time...  )...  so, perhaps I'll apply for the departmental secretary job at the hospital or go for the teaching ms office (I could do that, and it'd probably be fun for me)...  i dunno...  i guess it kinda depends on how my school schedule is gonna be, so i should stop worrying about it till after my meeting...  ugh...  i'm still so tired....      Tim takes his final today, and then he's done with nursing school :) He graduates May 19th.  I'm so happy for him...  He starts his new job at his hospital on June 10th.  We haven't been able to see much of eachother lately, but after he starts his new job maybe that will change.  It will be nice for him not to have to do both work and school for a while.  He's been so stressed out lately, I can't wait for him to be able to relax (and I'm sure he can't either)..  I'm so proud of him :)    I hope this meeting doesn't take too long...  i'm still hella tired, and i'm really not in the mood for this....  at least it's tuesday night and i get to see "That 70's Show" and "Smallville" when I get home...  :)    ...morelater...  ali

      so...  isn't it weird that the next generation of Star Wars fans will call the original Star Wars movie "A New Hope"...  I mean, I'm aware that it always was named "A New Hope", but no one ever actually  called  it that...  see what brought this on is my dad and I are watching Star Wars (special edition) and my 9-year-old brother came up and was like, "Cool, this is on?" and dad and I were like, "Yeah" and Greg was like, "Which one is it?" and we said, "Star Wars" and Greg said, "I know, but which one?" and we said, "Star Wars... the original" and Greg said... "Oh, 'A New Hope'" and ran downstairs to put it on..  How weird...    The best thing about R2D2 is he's like insert your lines here.. So while he's whistling and beeping you can't help but think in your head what he's saying...  I, for one, like to think that he's a little smartass and that he says rude things all the time :)  that's why he's my favorite :)

      I went for a 2 hour walk today in the  urlLink Vischer Ferry preserve .  It was really nice.  the sky was actually blue while i was out, the temperature was warm, and the smells and sounds of spring were in abundance....  i've never seen so many birds, they were all over the place.  i saw one pair of birds with bright orange-yellow chests chasing eachother, they looked like something right out of a disney movie.  I also saw this other HUGE bird, that i think was a crane.  At first when i saw it, i thought it was a swan because it looked very white when it flew across the canal, but when i got closer, i saw that it was gray.  it had a long neck, and when it flew, it drew its head close to its body.  it was really a big bird, the biggest i've ever seen close up in the wild.  i think its wingspan must have been like 3 or 4 feet.  it was really impressive and beautiful...  i was in a great mood while i was walking... i was thinking that no matter what the outcome of this break with tim, i'll be fine...  but when i got home, my mood came crashing down.  i may be fine eventually, but right now i miss him a lot.  and i still love him, and i wish he'd call.  he said he would, but what's he waiting for?  i mean even if we're just friends permanently, friends call eachother...  maybe he's waiting so that i have a chance to soak it in or whatever...  i don't know.  all i know is that this hurts, and i feel like i don't matter that much to him, or that this isn't hard for him, cause he doesn't call. :(

      i dreamed about tim again last night...  the first one was this long wierd dream where he was still living at home, but his room was huge, kinda like an apartment, and there were all of these annoying girls redecorating it.  they weren't professionals or anything, they were just people that he or his friends knew.  and all of his friends that were at the wedding were there, but i couldn't find tim all of the time.  i'd see him and then he'd be gone...  it was like i wasn't really supposed to be there either for some reason.. like we had fought or like we were supposed to be broken up (like we are now) but i was there.  i think i had dropped something off and then i stayed or something like that.  anyway, these girls were destroying his room.  a couple of them were sawing the legs off of this table that looked like the kitchen table that tim and i bought together.  and when i found him and told him about it, he was really upset...   so this dream was really weird...  i'm trying to figure out what it means...  i guess it probably means something like i'm afraid that by shutting me out tim will let people in who aren't so good for him.  these girls were destroying his room, and his friends were all just sitting around watching, letting it happen.  i guess the table that looked like the one that we bought together was probably pretty symbolic.  maybe it was supposed to be our relationship or our potential future together...  i dunno...  maybe that's reading too far into just a weird dream....  whatever it meant, it was depressing.  i had another dream about tim last night, but i won't post a description of that because that one was a little...  um... personal...  i miss him :(

I was really tired cause i'd been up all night at work the night before, and so i kept yawning...  then the dr kept drilling my gums  ouch  i was like, "see that pink part?  yeah, that's my gum, don't drill it"...  the appointment took forever, and then, to top it all off, they had B95.5 on the radio which plays soft rock (which irritates me to begin with) and there was some stupid radio show, 'Delilah', on and they played all sorts of love or post-love songs that really depressed the hell out of me.  They played that song from Pearl Harbor and if you don't think that it's about someone who's died, you can apply it to a dead relationship, and it's hella depressing...  and it made me think of the movie which made me think of going to see it with tim...  ugh, very depressing...  so i'm sitting there with my mouth crammed full of tubes and sucky-things and drills and fingers etc and i started tearing up.  sucked.  i miss tim.

      so i'm doing a little better on the crying thing, but i think it's because i haven't really accepted it.  it is just too sudden and it just seems to irrational and weird.  and i still love him...  i just don't think that it  can  be real.  but it is very possible that it is and that Tim and I will never be together again.  i don't know how to make myself accept that possibility.  i don't  want  to accept it, but i know that I have to.  I'm deluding myself into thinking that everything is ok by involuntarily imagining it, by just thinking that i haven't seen or spoken to tim because he's been busy.  i guess it will really be real for me as time passes.  i don't want it to happen, but i have no control over the situation...  this sux (understatement).  Now i'm off to work the overnight shift at the hospital...  hopefully i'll be busy so that i won't be sitting there thinking about how i miss tim and how he'll be awake and at his hospital...  i love him so much, and i'm so proud of him...  i can't believe that i won't be there when he graduates.  he's going to be such a great nurse, and he's worked so hard for it.  i hope he knows it.

      this sux.  after 5 years, tim just up and dumps me with no warning.  we'd been making all these plans (which, by the way, he always brought up) and then all of a sudden he needs time apart, and then he makes no effort to talk to me again.  what the hell.  i guess i can understand if he's freaking out, but why wouldn't he want to talk to  me then?  is he too afraid?  is he afraid that if we talked, he would go back on his decision?  or is he afraid that if we talked he'd only hurt me more?  this would hurt less if he had just come out and said, I'm sorry, I'm not in love with you anymore, we have to break up.  but instead he says, i have a problem with me, i need to work it out, i need some space.  so, what did he mean?  this sux.    my dad suggested that perhaps tim was trying to tell me something when he told me the story about giving his friend money at the wedding just cause he asked.  maybe tim feels like when he's put in a box, he just does what's expected of him.  so, maybe with graduating tim is wondering if he really wants to be a nurse or if he's doing it cause that's what was expected of him.  and, by the same token, maybe tim brought up moving in together and marriage because he thought that's what was expected of him at that point.  and so now he's trying to step back and see if he's been doing what he's been doing because he wanted to do it, or if he was doing it cause that's what was expected of him.  i'd really hate to think that tim was with me and talking about a future together just because that's what he thought was expected of him.  i certainly didn't put that expectation on him, or at least i didn't conciously.  i've actually always tried to not bring it up, because i didn't want to pressure him.  he's always been the one to bring it up.    so becky's response to that was that she didn't think that if he really did it only because that's what he thought was expected of him, that wouldn't make sense. because he wouldn't be the one to bring it up all the time if he only did it cause he thought it was expected of him.  if he thought that way, he'd probably avoid bringing it up at all..  i dunno.  i dunno if the preceding sentences made sense at all because i'm writing this when i'm really tired.    i dunno.  i don't know what to think.  i'm hurt that tim would treat me this way after five years.  but at the same time i'm not mad (not really, not yet anyway) because i'm pretty sure that he didn't set out to hurt me on purpose.  also, i don't think he really knows what he wants (and that sux.  makes me feel bad.  how can he not be sure after all this time?) and he seems very confused and scared.  i know that this isn't about me, it's about him.  ugh.  i'm not making any sense.  i'm just trying to write out what i'm feeling cause i can't stand thinking about it anymore.  he's acting like such a child right now.  he completely blew off his brother and wife (michael and amy, i  love  them, they're great) at his graduation cause he knew that they'd side with me and tell him he's being an asshole.  he probably felt guilty and so he avoided them.  he sux right now.  he should act like an adult.  i mean, why would you act like that?  it's like he's reverting back to his childhood and he's pushing away everyone who would encourage him to become an adult.  he's really got a lot of growing up to do, and i guess i've felt that before, but now i know it.  it will be interesting to see how he handles starting his new job.  i can't see him moving out on his own either.  not unless his mother went and picked out an apartment and moved him in.    i, on the other hand, have started looking around, and i plan on moving out asap.  i can't wait around for him to grow up, cause i guess i don't know if that will ever happen.  this situation just sux.  why would he make all these plans with me just to suddenly dump me and not talk to me again?  what's going on?  i have no closure.  there was no problem, no big blow up...  he decides to end it by saying that he still wants to be my friend as he walks around with me holding my hand.  and then he never makes an effort to contact me.  what the hell.  i mean, if he just wanted to break up with me he should have had the balls to do it.  and if he wanted to be my friend, he should have had the balls to call me.  what the hell.  now i'm just left in this awful limbo.  i guess i just have to assume it's permanent.  i hoped that it would have ended better if it had to end at all.  i just want to talk to him and see what he's thinking.  is he relieved?  or does he think this sux also?  i have no idea.  i think he owes it to me to talk to me and give me some closure.  and through all this, i can't help but miss him so much.  i was happy.  i thought he was happy (although i was obviously wrong).  we had so much fun together.  i thought we were in love.  he led me to believe that we had a future together.  and then he suddenly took it all back.  this sux, i miss him, and i'm increadibly hurt.

      my interview went well today.  the job sounds like it'd be pretty ideal, so i hope i get it.  Tim couldn't go to lunch today.  Here's pretty much how our im conversation went:  Ali: Tim?  you there?  Ali (a few minutes later): guess not..  :(  call me when you get the chance...  i miss you :(  Tim: i'm here, i just woke up  Ali: oh, did you work last night?  Tim: yeah  Ali: oh, sorry  Tim: for what?  Ali: for bothering you  Tim: you're not bothering me  Ali: sure?  Tim: yeah  Ali: so, do you want to get something to eat later?  Tim: not today. i have some stuff i have to do.  Ali: oh, ok.  Tim: i have to go, i need to take a shit. talk to you later.  Ali: k  Tim: seeya  Ali: bye  and then, after a few minutes i left him this message:  Ali: Tim, please call me, i won't take up too much of your time, i just want to arrange a time to meet if that's ok with you.  i need to talk to you.  and then after a few minutes he just got offline.  i tried to call his house but his dad said that tim wasn't there, which had to be a lie because tim had  just  gotten offline.  so i left a message on his cellphone saying that i thought it was mean of him to have his dad lie to me, and i just needed to talk to him (that i wasn't going to try and get him back or anything, cause i know that's not what he wants) and that he should call me cause i'm not going to call him anymore cause it's embarrassing.   I am just so upset.  i don't deserve to be treated llike that.  and he shouldn't be acting like that, i mean, he's 23 going on 24 years old.  you shouldn't have your parents lie for you.  freakin be a man and answer the fucking phone.  i mean, if he changed his mind about meeting me cause he thinks it's too soon, fine.  whatever.  but we have some unfinished business about this breakup.  don't tell me you need a break and time apart if you really want to break up with me.  don't tell me that you want to still be my friend if that's too much for you.  don't tell me you still love me if you don't.  the saddest thing ever to me is when someone is too much of a wimp to own up to their feelings...  there's this barenaked ladies song that always makes me sad where two people stay together even though one's not in love with the other anymore, i think it's called break your heart or something like that.  anyway, in the song the one that's not in love says that he didn't want to break her heart, which is why he never broke up with her.  then she says "you arrogant man/ what do you think think that i am/ my heart will be fine/ just i'm wasting my time" and i hope so much that that song doesn't apply to me.  i just don't understand what happened.  he was the one that suggested we meet, and i thought he still cared about me, at least it sounded that way on sunday.  what happened?  i just need to talk to him.  i need to see it in his face that he doesn't want this anymore, and then i'll be able to move on.  but right now, i'm just stuck in limbo.  and i hate this.  this whole thing makes no sense to me.  i've thought about it over and over and it just doesn't make sense.  nothing was wrong, and then this, which makes me believe that it's not about me, it's about him.  he's freaking out.  but why have your dad lie to me?  why deliberately avoid talking to me?  that really hurts.  i mean, it's not like i was harrassing him or anything.  whatever.  this just hurts, and i don't know what to do about it.  and all i want to do is talk to him.  i need to know what he's thinking, what's going on.  this sux

      so...  what else happened today...  oh, i got new underwear!  that was exciting :) i got a free pair of nude colored underwear from Victoria's Secret (coupon) and $5 off my purchase, so i got another cute pair of underwear - multicolored thin stripes - and a cute yellow bra.  they made me happy  :)  i played ddr (5th mix) at the mall, that was fun...  i put together cover letters and resumes for a bunch of different jobs.  i've decided that i'm going to apply for a part time job that has set hours (and preferably pays well also) that will work when i go back to school.  and so i'll work that job and the hospital job over the summer and when i go back to school in the fall i'll cut back to just the part time job.  so i'm excited :) i've put together two of my professional little cover letter/resume packets to go out in the mail tomorrow, and two more packets to be faxed tomorrow, and then i have a bunch of other ads marked in the paper for places that i'm going to call.  this should be exciting.  i hate interviewing, but i need a new job.  it's time to stop bitching about the crappy job that i have now and start looking for a new one.  also, getting a job that will work while i go back to school will help me with my anxiety about the fall.   so... what else...  i've started reading a new book,  The Nanny Diaries  which is pretty good so far...  and... ugh... i still haven't touched my laundry or started cleaning my room...  it's late now, so i promise myself (and you're witnessing) that i'll start all that cleaning crap tomorrow...  i give anyone who reads this permission to email/im me to bug me if they see on the webcam that i haven't started yet...

      so yesterday i decided that i would call tim and wish him congratulations and good luck on his graduation.  i couldn't stand not hearing from him, and i figured that communication works both ways and it kinda felt like some sort of head game waiting for him to call me.  so i called him (i was hella nervous making that call) and i got his voicemail and left him a message.   he called me today (YAY!)  here's the play by play:  i was in friendly's with my family after church and i was finished eating (i ordered breakfast foods so mine came out first) and my phone rang (well, buzzed in my pocket actually) i saw it was him so i went outside to answer it.  the phone call was kinda awkward, but i don't see how it couldn't have been.  neither one of us knows what's going on in the other one's head, so we don't really know what to say to eachother right now.  he asked me how i was hanging in there, and i said ok (i wanted to say, 'well, i've been in agony, how have you been' but i thought i should keep things light and upbeat).  i asked him if he had to work last night cause he sounded tired, and he said that he did (which explains why he waited until today to return my call).  i congratulated him on graduation and he said thanks, and that he missed rehearsal, but i assured him that he'd do fine.  he thanked me for the graduation card that i said him, and said that the message was beautiful, and i told him that i meant it.  he suggested that we meet sometime this week for lunch or something, and i said that would be good, and he told me that he'd call me sometime this week.  and he kept asking me if i needed anything, and he asked me to promise that i'd call him if i did.  at the end of the conversation, we really didn't know how to end it.  we used to always end our conversations with I love you, but...  he said that he had to go cause he needed to get ready to go to graduation, and i said ok.  then he said that he'd talk to me later and i said ok..  then there was an awkward pause... then he was like, ok, i'll talk to you later, bye, and i said bye... and then there was another pause...  and then he said, um, alright i'll talk to you later and hung up.   so, i'm not sure what to make of the conversation.  he sounded genuinely happy to talk to me, and he sounded caring and concerned about me... there was a gentleness to his voice.  so that's good.  it was an awkward conversation, but like i said before, neither of us really knows what the other one's thinking, so...  i'm glad he suggested that we see eachother sometime this week...  i'm unsure about the lunch thing.  i mean, is this definate friend zone?  or is lunch an easy way to get together and talk?  i don't know...  i definately feel much better about everything right now.  i've talked to him (he's still alive)... he didn't sound cold or uncaring on the phone...  i will see him this week.  i hope that after we see eachother, we'll both have a better idea of what's going on...  i mean, i've just been in such limbo over the past week, i'd just like a firmer understaning of what he's thinking and feeling.  does he just want a break or a break up?  knowing one way or the other (even if it's the way that i don't want it to be) will be so much better than this not knowing crap.  i'm nervous and i can't wait to see him..  he probably won't call tomorrow...  i hope he calls by wednesday, if he doesn't call by then i'll start to convince myself that he really didn't want to meet me, but that he just said that..  although i'm sure that he does want to meet me...  i'm just not sure about where he wants to go with our relationship from here...   ah well, enough analyzing this for the night...

      I'm having a depressed day.  I just can't help thinking about all of the fun that Tim and I had together and I miss him so bad, and I'm so hurt that he doesn't want that anymore.  I know I just have to move on and it will all get better eventually, but I really don't  want  to move on in my life without him.  I know I can do it, and I know I have to do it, but it doesn't change the fact that I don't  want  to do it.  I know that it would be better for me if I could just cut him out of my life all together.  I've been thinking about him and caring about him, but I don't know that he's been doing the same for me.  He probably hasn't.  I'm not being fair to myself by continuing to give to a relationship that's not there anymore.  But it was just taken away so quickly that I don't know how to react.  I'm not mad at him.  He wasn't a jerk.  He can't help the way he feels.  But I can't help the way that I feel either.  I hurt and I can't help but still want him and still think about him.  I've been doing everything that I can to distract myself, but I can't stop thinking of him all the time.  He was just such a huge part of my life for so long.  People notice all the time that I'm not my usual chipper self, and I hate that.  He says this is 'for the best' and that he hopes that someday I'll see that.  Well, I don't.  I think he's made a huge mistake, and I hope someday he'll see that.  Well, that was a depressing post, but it's the only thing on my mind right now.  ali

      had to work the overnight shift last night.  it was so long and boring, i wanted to be dead.  i couldn't sleep at all yesterday before i went to work, and so by the time i left i'd been up for 24 hours.  and i was so tired that i felt extremely ill.  and then some woman rearended me.  i was sitting at a stop light crying because i'm depressed and i was too tired to deal with anything and she was behind me and she just hit me.  and when i looked in my rearview mirror she was waving like, "it's ok", and i was like, "no, it's not 'ok' you're an idiot and you just hit me with your car."  anyway, i didn't pull over or anything because she really only tapped me (but it was enough to rock my car and confuse me) so i knew there wouldn't be a mark or anything.  but i was still pissed.  stupid woman.   so i just finished a book by candace bushnell the woman who wrote sex and the city called 4 blondes.  it was a good book...  4 short stories about powerful blonde women in nyc, but most of them dealt with failed long term relationships and they depressed the hell out of me.  anyway, i'm going out for shopping therapy now.  ali

      so, here's my horoscope for today:   Your Daily Horoscope: Cancer    You should be feeling pretty excited when it comes to your most important relationships today, and you ought to be pretty hard to resist right now. Dont be afraid to make your feelings known and ask for whatever you want from that special person in your life. You should be primed for romantic success right now.   I hope it's right...   i didn't hear from tim yesterday, but he said in his voicemail on monday that yesterday would probably not be a good day...  so i hope i hear from him today...  i'm getting ready to go to my second interview with that drs' office in albany...  i can't help but still be a little nervous.  i don't like the outfit that i have to wear, but i only had one interview outfit (poor planning), so now i won't look  as  sharp as before, but it's still appropriate...  i hope this goes well...  more later... ali

      YAY!!  The job that I interviewed for last Thursday called me back today :)  One of the Dr's in the practice wasn't there for the interview because he was out of town, and he called me back today.  He said that Bill (the other Dr) was very impressed with the way I presented my background during the interview and that he was too after reviewing my stuff.  He said that they didn't want to hire anyone without both Drs meeting with them, so he asked if I could come back for a second interview tomorrow morning at 9:15...  I'm so happy!  I think I'm getting this job :)  YAY!!  This is the one that would work perfectly: Mon-Fri 9-1 $10/hr :)

      i believe i have the upper hand...  after thursday tim didn't call.  i started to think that maybe this was his way of saying that he just really did want to break up and had no intentions of getting back together.  so i started to think about this whole thing in permanent terms, and i felt bad that maybe the last thing i ever would say to tim was that upset and accusing voicemail i left him on thursday.  so saturday while i drove down the northway on my way to pennsylvania, i left him one last voicemail.  i said that i didn't know what to make of thursday and that i couldn't understand why he didn't want to talk to me.  i said that the way he's handled everything left me in a state of confusion, and i needed to talk to him to get things cleared up, and that i deserved that from him.  i also said that i didn't want "us" to end badly, i thought that after five years we deserved more than that.  i told him that i was on my way to pennsylvania, and that i had some interviews this week and that i'd been thinking about apartments in albany and that there was one on madison ave that i think i'm going to look at.  and then i realized that i'd been blabbing so i just said that i hoped he was doing ok, and i hoped that i'd hear from him.  after i hung up, i was satisfied thinking that if that was the last thing i ever said to tim, it correctly showed how i was feeling and what i was thinking, and it wasn't weak or bitchy.   so i drove to PA...  the trip was uneventful.  i listened to my new minidisc player, it worked great :)  I love new electronics...  I had a good trip.  it was nice to see my mom and RJ again...  Saturday night we just hung around my Aunt Karen and Uncle Bobby's house driking tequilla :)  then Sunday we all pitched in to help Karen get ready for Nana and PopPop's party (it was at Karen and Bobby's house, but it was catered).  Everyone showed up early for the party, but it was a success.  The appetizers that mom and RJ made were great and the catered food was very good.  the weather cooperated the whole time, it was warm out (not too hot, not too cold) and it didn't rain.  Karen got a cake to look just like their wedding cake (it was beautiful) and a cake for my great uncle vince who's birthday happened to be that day (she got both cakes made by a local woman for $30, can you believe that?!).  My Aunt Denise made the cutest favors using a candle that looked like a little potted tulip and hershey kisses all wrapped in tulle and tied with a gold ribbon.  attached to the ribbon was a paper heart with "ned and jean 1952 - 2002" written on it and a tiny copy of their wedding photo.  That morning i checked my voicemail and tim had left me a message...  he sounded pretty nervous.  he said that he didn't know what to tell me about Thursday, he didn't mean to blow me off, and he does want to talk to me.  he said he was "shocked" about me looking for an aparment and said that he'd help me look for one...  he kept saying that he wanted to talk to me and he kept calling me hon...  then he said that he had to work sunday and monday night but that he'd call me monday...   then yesterday i got a message from him around 5pm...  he again sounded nervous, he tried to crack a couple jokes and sound normal, but he didn't really succeed at that...  he said that he had to work that night but that he wanted to get together with me some time later this week to talk and that he'd call me...  i bet he expected to hear from me by this morning when he left work, but i'm not calling him back.  i want him to call me...  and i'm sure he will...

      ok. so...  i was reading the comments posted on my page a little earlier, and i really appreciate the supportive things said :)  i visited  urlLink the one guy's page , and he posted a little comment on it along with a link to my blog...  he said:  "This is my last post until Monday. I was cruising around other people's blogs and ran into this story about a girl who's boyfriend dumps her and then asks her to fix his computer. Imagine the audacity! and she goes over and fixes the computer! Holy crap?!?! "  and damn, when you put it like that, what  was  i thinking?  nothing like listening to a total stranger's point of view to really give you a kick in the pants...  (for the record...  i didn't know that he was a lying, cheating asshole at the time and i thought i could be his friend.  but then i realized that by trying to be his friend it kept me hanging on.  so i went over there thinking that i'll do him this favor [but  why  really?] and tell him that i couldn't deal with being his friend anymore... and if i hadn't gone and found that card that 'the other woman' gave him, i probably would have never found out that he's a lying, cheating asshole) and now that i think of it, how could i ever have really lasted with a guy who's so technologically clueless?

He's lied to me, he's lied to his friends, and he's lied (probably still is) to his new girlfriend.  *he fucking cheated on me.  and then when 'the other woman' insisted that he break it off with me, he did... calling it a break.  and he had no intention of ever telling me what was really going on.  and he lied to her telling her that he told me about her.  but he didn't.  he kept me hanging on.  kept calling me honey...  kept saying that he loved me while he was telling her he loved her too.  and even when i confronted him about it with evidence he lied to me.  and he did it again and agian.  asshole.   *he's apparently been telling people that i'm making things up.  sorry, but this is all stranger than fiction to me.  i couldn't just make this shit up.  He was my first love and he fucked me over.   *he's a cheating, lying asshole, and i am  so  done with him.  I'm so glad that i got to be the one to tell him that i never wanted to see him again and hang up on him  twice  (yeah, he came back for more)   so that's it.  if I write more about it please feel free to yell at me.

      so today went well at my first day at my new job.  the job seems pretty easy, and i'm pretty sure that i'm going to love it...  i'm still nervous though, i want to do a good job...    so i'm doing much better today than i was last night...  last night i think i was in psychogenic shock (becky's term, i didn't come up with that on my own)...  i could barely stand or walk, i felt like i was in a daze and about to faint...  i couldn't eat (although i did force myself because i thought that would help - it didn't) and i felt like i was going to throw up everytime i thought of what happened....  i still kinda feel that way today...  eating holds no interest for me, and i still feel sick to my stomach anytime i think of it...   and there were a couple of times at work today when the room started spinning...  but it's much better than last night...    i can't wait to feel better, i've been so depressed over the last few weeks...  i've seriously lost 10 pounds, and i haven't been trying to lose weight at all...  in fact, i've been thinking that i've been eating way too much and way too many bad things...   i just still can't believe that tim is such an ass.  what the hell...  i mean, for almost five years he wasn't an ass.  and then he dumps me and starts up with this woman (yeah, so not a girl)..  makes me feel like complete shit, like he didn't care for me at all if he can just do that right away.  and then to lie to me?  why would he do that?  we're broken up, he might as well tell me the truth...  or did he still want to keep me hanging on in case he changed his mind...  and if i hadn't found the card, he never would have told me about it.  and i even kinda asked about it thursday at lunch when he said that he and anna went canoeing and he said "come on ali" like that was ludicrous...  and it's gross that he would still call me honey etc when he's been "seeing" someone else.  he obviously knows it's not something he should be doing and he's obviously embarrassed and ashamed to tell me the truth.  what a complete jerk.  he's hurt me so much.  i wish i could just stop loving him, i mean just stop now.  but i can't stop, and i can't stop hurting.  it'll be good when anger takes over, but for now all i can do is be shocked and hurt.  i'm so fucking naive...  i didn't think he would lie to me.  i trusted him.  i believed him when he told me that he still loved me too.

      so, tim's an asshole.  I feel so sick thinking of how he's treated me.  I deserve  so  much more respect...  I went to his house yesterday to help him out with his palm and when I got there he was just hanging up the phone with someone, saying he'd see them later or something...  and it didn't sound like he was talking to a guy...  so we went into his room and I started to try and figure out what was wrong with his computer.  being in his room was weird.  he still had the photos of us around, and on his bookshelf underneath his desk he had a book on buying engagement rings...  at one point tim was staring at something and when i asked him what he was thinking about he said he was thinking of the two of us in one of the pictures there...  i couldn't help but get depressed trying to figure out what went wrong.  His phone rang like three times while I was there and at one point he was gone for like 10 minutes on the phone.  and he kept going outside to smoke.  so one of those times when he was out of his room and i was waiting for his computer to reboot, i noticed a pile of cards on his dresser, and on the top was a card that looked like one i'd given him.  it was a small card with a picture on the front of two people kissing in front of the eiffel tower.  i picked it up to see what i'd written inside and it fucking wasn't from me.  it was from anna, one of his 'friends' from the hospital who just divorced her husband.  inside it started out saying "i'm falling more in love with you every day...  you came into my life as a friend and i know you'll stay that way" or something like that...  i was so hurt and shocked that i put it back and started shaking...  i took off his sweater and socks that he had given me to wear (it was cold in his room) and packed up my things.  when tim came back in the room he sat down on the bed and i confronted him.   i told him that i needed him to be very honest with me...  and i asked him if there was somebody else...  and he said yes.  i wanted to die.  then i asked him how long and he said a couple of weeks...  i pointed out that our relationship had only been over for a couple of weeks...  i was crying...  then he said that he wasn't fucking her or anything, but that she wanted to be more than friends and he didn't...  that she was looking for a rebound relationship and that he wasn't looking for a relationship at all...  he said that in five years there had never been anyone else and that he wouldn't ever cheat on me...  and i believed him...  he apologized to me...  i still felt horribly crushed.  i told him that i felt i was conspired against because i think that anna and jen hate me (although, i really don't know why.  i've never done anything to them, and i actually liked them before).  he said that no one helped him make his decision, he made it on his own, and that they didn't hate me, just that they thought that we weren't right for eachother (what gave them the right to tell him that, they didn't even know us together).  so then he said somthing about us being friends and being there for eachother and i told him that i can't.  i can't be his friend when i still love him so much.  he said ok and apologized for asking me to go to lunch with him and fix his computer..  i told him not to apologize because i accepted, i had thought that i could be his friend, but everytime i saw him or heard from him it got my hopes up...  he said that he wouldn't call me anymore, and that i should call him when i feel that i can...  i gave him a letter to read that explained everything i felt (it said that i couldn't do this anymore because he still talked to me like i was his girlfriend and it was his decision to end it and he was leading me on and keeping me hanging on and i was not going to be a back up girlfriend)  he walked me out to my car and in the garage i asked him for a hug, and he gave me a big hug, and then held onto me while we talked a little more...  then i kissed him, and he definatley kissed back but we stopped and talked more...  i told him that this hurt a lot and he said that it hurt him too....  he said to leave him my new number when i moved...  when i left he looked on the verge of tears.  when i got home, i saw that jen had posted a response to my last post, saying that anna was seeing tim.  i don't know what she thinks gives her the right to tell me that.  if tim hadn't already told me i would have really been upset.  that was horrible of her.  but she said seeing.  as in a relationship.  and tim said that there wasn't one.  i'm so sickened that he would lie to me like that.  how can he be in a relationship with anna when our almost five year relationship just ended, and he still tells me that he loves me but he doesn't want a relationship right now.  eww.  everytime i think of it i want to throw up.  i can't believe he's acting like such an asshole, he never was an asshole before.  how can he think of being in a relationship so fast?  where's the mourning period?  it's just a rebound thing that won't work and will hurt them both...   I'm just so sick to my stomach thinking of it.  I can't believe he lied to me like that.  why would he do that?  to keep me hanging on still?  i just can't believe he's such an ass.  i was being so honest with him and he lied to me...   well, now i have to stop thinking of this and get ready for my first day at my new job...  more later...  ali

      Sunday was a pretty good day actually...   i went to church in the morning and the priest was the long-winded one but he told a humorous story about being preached to by a 10-year-old Jehovah's witness on his front stoop....  then i went shopping at wal-mart with my dad...  i love my daddy :)   then i talked to tim, who wanted me to come over and fix his palm (it won't sync right with his computer) but he decided that he was too tired today, so i'm going over tomorrow.  I know, i shouldn't...  but i figure i'm going to do this favor for him, and then tell him that i don't think i can be his friend right now while my feelings for him are still wanting to be a girlfriend and so i'm not going to be able to see him for a while.  not till i can get over these feelings that i have for him.  I hope I'll be able to be his friend someday, but right now it can't happen because everytime i see him or hear from him i get my hopes up, so in order for me to heal not seeing him is probably best. :(   then becky came over and we went out for cofee and then came back here to watch the 3rd season of Sex and the City on DVD.  We watched it for 6 hours :) I love that show...  i figure that if i identify with anyone on that show, it's probably a mix between Carrie and Charlotte...  I tend to be sometimes innocent like Charlotte, but I also tend to obsess over relationships like Carrie (that should be obvious from the content of this website)...  watching that show makes me feel more confident, sexy and powerful...  like somehow the attitudes of the characters rub off on me or something...  anyway, so we watched Sex and the City and then went to Denny's for like the third night in a row and got late night food...  so that explains why it's 3am and I'm up posting to my blog...

      okso tonight becky and i went out to friday's because it was local and becky didn't have any cash so she could charge her drinks there.  we both had two "ultimate" size drinks (i had the hawian volcano - my favorite) and we were pretty drunk by the time we left there (this is actually the drunkest i've been in a while) because we're apparently old ladies and it only takes two drinks to get us drunk.  anyway.  so when we were leaving fridays we had to walk through the bar part and i was following becky and when i passed this one guy he said "hey, ladies..." and yeah he totally wasn't looking at my  face .  you know, i just can't tell you how impressed i am when a guy talks directly to my chest.  i mean, i know it's impressive and all but, dude.  don't be that obvious :)  anyway, i felt like i had something more witty to say but i'm still drunk and i should just put mysefl to bed and it's kinda pretty lame that i'm sitting here drunka t my computer posting to my blog at 2am.  later. ali

      so today Becky and I went to Target (pronounced Tar-jay) to look at cheap-ass but stylish furniture with which we could furnish our cheap-ass but stylish first apartments.  (well, mine will be cheap-ass, i'm not an engineer like Becky).  Anyway, so Becky decided to purchase a cheap-ass but stylish 3 shelf bookcase.  It was small but it was labeled "team lift" so we both lugged it up to the register (the box was deceiving... it was really kinda heavy).  We heaved the box up on the conveyor belt and the cashier scanned it but left it there because it was heavy.  Becky proceeded to pay for her purchases while I waited by the box so I could help her lift it when she was set to go.  In the meantime, a big jabba-the-hut looking slob came up behind us with a few items in his hands.  This guy was gross looking...  he was very tall (I'm 5' 9.5" and he towered over me) and he was very round (I wondered how his bones and joints supported him).  He was sweaty, with stains on the front of his shirt and he had stringy, curly, long blond hair.  He saw me standing next to the shelf box while Becky was signing her credit card slip and said to me, "Do you think you can move that?"  I was annoyed that he asked me because the box was heavy and I couldn't moved it by myself, and there was a lot of room left on the conveyor belt (see diagram below) because the box was standing on it's side.  He could have put his few items on the belt beside the box, or hey, he could have waited a minute for us to move it because it's not like he was holding anything heavy.  He had like three things in his hands, and one was a loaf of bread.  So I said to him (and this came out  much  snottier than I meant it, I'm usually a very sweet person and I hate it when people are snotty), "Do you think you can wait a minute?"  Then he yelled at me, "Hey don't get snotty with me" which kinda scared me, cause he was  much  bigger than me and he looked like he could have been crazy.  I turned around to look at Becky for help and she hurried over to grab the shelf.  She said as we were walking away, "Sorry sir, but, it's not like we were going to leave it there forever."  As we were walking away he kept going on...  "you don't know me...  i've got back problems" and after he heard what Becky said he said, "you shut your mouth!"  Anyway, it scares me that there are wierd, inconsiderate people out there that will pick on young girls...

      screw it.  i'm not going to worry about that one any more.  I'll look at it again later when i'm not so frustrated...   here's the description that was supposed to go in the overlib for walking on sunshine: Your upbeat approach to life makes "Walking on Sunshine" the perfect anthem for you. We can see you dancing down the vegetable isle with your grocery cart, smiling at all the checkout clerks. We sure hope you've had your Wheaties to keep up with your perky pace all day long. This happy, horn-driven tune carries you to work every day. And even in those brief lapses when you're not fully on your game, "Walking On Sunshine" seems to put things in perspective and get you back to your super groove. "And don't it feel good?" Who cares that this tune was a one-hit wonder for Katrina and the Waves? Even that quality matches your one-of-a-kindness. You're walkin' on sunshine and spreading it wherever you go. while i'm on the subject of overlibs, i really enjoy this javascript and i think it's extremely useful, so you should  urlLink go here  to learn more about it.

      i got my car fixed today.  It needed a new motor mount, which is apparently some part that keeps your motor from shaking the whole car while it's running.  it only took about an hour, but it didn't seem that long because i had brought a book along to read...  i sat outside the dealership on a bench while i read and regretted being a woman.  well, not really.  i regretted the fact that i could not sit in the most comfortable position to read because it wouldn't look "ladylike"...  it was most comfortable for me to put one leg on either side of the bench, then place the book in front of me on the bench and lean forward to read it.  very comfortable: it allowed me to lean on my elbows to read the book while at the same time stretch out my hips.  But after some old guy looked at me funny i realized that it also probably looked pretty slutty.  so yet again i'm forced to give up comfort because i'm a woman.  but really, in all other respects, i'm so glad i'm a girl...  you can always get people (guys) to lift/move/open things for you and i've never once gotten a speeding ticket although i've been pulled over many times for flagrently disobeying the speed limit.

      so Friday at work i had to use the shredder (paper shredder, not teenage mutant ninja turtles villian) for the first time...  the shredder in my little office is an old industrial cross shredder that makes tiny 1/4 inch square confetti pieces and drops them into a bin located in the stand beneath it.  I fed about three documents into the shredder before i heard a giant grymph sound...  it, of course had jammed...  it then began beeping loudly and incessantly...  i'm thinking, "please don't let anyone hear, it's only my second day alone here, and i don't want them to think i'm an idiot"...  i figured out that the only way to stop the thing from beeping was to take the bin that the confetti falls into out of the machine...  so i took it out, made sure that it was set on manual mode and in the stop position and proceeded to try and clear out the jam...  i stuck my hand up in the scanner...  and out fell a pile of confetti about three feet in diameter and two feet high (ok...  so maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration...  but it was a huge pile of tiny paper pieces)...  so now i'm sitting there staring at a huge pile of confetti sitting on the floor of my office thinking, "great, what am i going to do with that?"...  so...  then i think, "maybe i can just push the cart on which the shredder sits on top of the pile and then no one will see it...  or i can be responsible and try and find the vaccum cleaner"...  so i figure that for now i should try and pick up the stray pieces around the pile, because the drs are at lunch and i don't know where the vaccum is...  so i kick of my shoes and kneel down on the floor in my skirt and begin picking up individual pieces of confetti and depositing them into the bin... and then Dr.W walks in and says, "anything exciting happen while i was gone?"  "the scanner blew up" was my reply...  he eyed me picking up individual pieces of confetti and said, "the vaccum's in the hall closet" before i had a chance to ask him about it.   I went to the closet which was about 14 inches wide and struggled to pull out the vaccum which was about 13.5 inches wide...  i lugged it into the office and proceeded to turn around in circles looking for an empty plug...  Dr.W came back in after i'd made my fifth sircle and pointed out the empty plug (right under my nose)...  after he left i tried to figure out the vaccum cleaner.  My vaccum at home is the canister type...  when you detach the hose from the power head thingy it automatically sucks through the hose...  well, apparently the standup type doesn't work that way...  i kept trying different things to make it work, but nothing would make the hose work...  and down the hall, i'm sure the drs heard the vaccum turning on and off... on and off..  i must have sounded like a complete idiot.  i couldn't ever figure out how to get the hose to work, so instead i kept reaching down and spreading out the confetti pile and then running the vaccum over it...   believe me, that story is  much  funnier when you hear it in person...  actually, you have to see me tell it, because there are all sorts of facial expressions and arm motions that go along with it...  so maybe you should read it again and imagine that i'm jumping around making erratic arm movements and exaggerated faces...

      so this weekend i'm stuck at home all weekend because my parents are both out of town.  my dad just left for saudi arabia today and my mom went to hilton head, sc, to pick up her grandson and bring him up here for a visit.  so what sucks is i'm expected to be here all weekend to look after my brothers.  so this is why it bothers me that they make me pay rent.  they make me pay rent, and at the same time they treat me like i was still a kid living off them.  they just expect me to always be here to watch kids/do favors whatever for them.  but if i was just a tenant paying rent they wouldn't expect me to watch kids.  the deal was i had to pay them 200/month to live here, not i had to pay them 200/month and perform any babysitting or assorted chores to live here.  not that i really mind, but i was planning on picking up two shifts at the hospital this weekend so that i'd have rent money for next month.  so i think that they should pay me the 160 that i'm missing out on by having to stick around the house all weekend.  i mean, really, where else are you going to get a babysitter that'd watch your kids for four days (fri, sat, sun, mon) for 160?  i just hope they see it my way when i hand them 40 for rent next month...  morelater

      just got back from a basketball/picnic thing with some people that i used to work with when i was at the testing job.  I suck majorly at basketball, but i attempted to play one game.  the other players on my team were pretty good, but we ended up losing (but only by 2).  i had a good time and met some nice people (i'm glad that no one was taking the game too seriously, cause i probably would have pissed them off with my suckiness).  I hate that I suck at sports.  Since I'm a tall girl people always have assumed that I'd be good at sports (particularly basketball and volley ball.)  but I'm not...  ah well...

      so i figured out why they hired me at my new job...  besides the fact that i'm just an excellent person all around, i also have knowledge of computers/networking/the internet/web page building etc that the doctors do not have and that apparently the average person doesn't have.  So they just got road runner in the office (thank God) and now they're looking to me to set up the network in the office and they've begun asking me all sorts of questions regarding setting up a web page.  I kind of get the feeling that they're going to ask me to do it.  I don't mind.  I mean, it's fun work for me, it's my hobby.  but most people who do that sort of work get paid more than what i'm getting paid.  and those duties really do go above and beyond typical administrative assistant duties.  so now i wonder if i should try to work out something where i can bill them for time speant working on the page or not...  i dunno...

      blah...  i remember why i don't like working at the hospital anymore...  tonight was the first night that i'd worked there in, like, forever...  the actual job isn't that bad...  the work can be varied and i was pretty busy tonight...  but the people that work there are  such  complainers...  there was so much bickering and bitching, it was almost unbearable... and everything there reminded me of when i used to be with tim.  i used to call him all the time from there and he'd show up every once in a while and surprise me with chinese food for lunch...  but he's an asshole now.  he's gone to the dark side.  darth tim.  anyway...  i was able to have some fun tonight though...  when people there aren't bitching about something (and unfortunately this is very rare) they can be great and we can have some fun conversations...  ugh...  anyway...  not much else to write about tonight..  "not much to say about spoons...  they're either in your hands on in your mouth"  "Much like genitals."  (- just on SNL)

      so i ended up writing tim back.  i didn't want to not write him back and then have him feeling that i hate him but at least he apologized so his concience could be clear.  i wrote him and told him that i thought that cheating is the worst thing that one person can do to another in a relationship and that he left me feeling gullible and stupid.  i said that he'd destroyed any trust that i had in him and that after finding out how much he lied to me i didn't know if i could believe him when he says that he's sorry.  i said that i didn't want to dwell on it anymore and that i'm starting to enjoy being single again and i told him that i'm a forgiving person by nature who doesn't hold grudges and i hope that someday we can be friendly to each other but that now is too soon for me.  i needed to write the part about cheating because i wasn't sure if he knew that i knew he cheated or not.  well...  he wrote me back.  he didn't know that i knew, because in his reply he maintains his innocence.  he says that he broke up with me because he hadn't been happy for a while and didn't tell me cause he didn't want to hurt me and that anything else came after the fact.  he says that he didn't lie to me at all.  but that's a lie.  even if he didn't get together with anna until after we broke up (which i was told he was with her before he broke up with me) he still told me that there was nothing going on between them after we broke up.  he said that he wasn't involved with her, when he was.  he was telling her that he loved her, and you don't just tell that to someone you're just fucking or whatever.  i mean, regardless of whether or not he actully cheated on me, he still lied to me about being in a relationship with her after we broke up.  so now he's emailing me saying, i never lied to you, believe what you want...  whatever.  he did lie to me.  and if he'd just freaking admit him maybe i'd be able to have the littlest amount of respect for him.  but he's  still  lying to me.  argh.  i'm going to write him back one more time and then that's it.  everything else gets deleted.  i'm not sure what i'm going to say yet...  morelater

      so tim emailed me today.  he wrote me to say that he was truly sorry and that he wanted to tell me that because he couldn't live with his conscience any more.  he said that he understood my reasons for not wanting to talk to him and that he wouldn't write or call me, but that he hoped everything is well with me.  i don't know what i even think about that.  i mean, he lied to me so much and completely treated me without any respect.  how do i know now that he's truly sorry or that he even understands how much he hurt me?  it's too soon.  i was just beginning to be able to get through the day without thinking of him and now he has to go and bring it all up again.  if he's really sorry, then good, he should be.  but i just don't trust him anymore and i don't know what to believe.

      so i just left for linens and things when some guys came with a big truckload of mulch saying that we ordered it.  but our dad had just gotten mulch last month and had just finished removing the pile from the driveway.  anyway, the one guy told my sister that the order he had said our address on it and so they dumped it.  then they asked my brother for a check for $107.  at this point i had to come back to the house and get things straightened out.  i pulled up to the side of the road and got out and started walking towards the two guys who were leaning up against their truck in my driveway.  i said, "do you have a work order?" and i guess i must have looked pissed cause the one guy said, "smile".  so i smiled and said, "do you have a work order?" and the guy was like, duh...  then he looked in his truck and found a slip of paper that had our address on it, but the last name and phone number was wrong.  when i told him this he realized that they'd made a mistake and started to get annoyed saying, well, i'm not shoveling that mulch back into the truck...  he tried to call the number that was on the paper but it was disconnected.  then he tried to call his boss, but he was out of the office for a minute.  so they had to wait around in our driveway calling their office intermittently trying to figure out what they should do.  we all kicked a soccer ball around the front yard while the one guy was asking me all sorts of questions.  "did you go to shen?" "when did you graduate" "did you know chris nichols?" "do you go to college?" "what did you study?" these two guys were weird looking.  the one that was asking me all those questions was younger, probably a few years older than me and he was a big guy - he said he played lacrosse and football when he was in school, but he wasn't very cute...  the other guy looked like he was straight off the farm or something..  he was small, with a weak chin and bad teeth...  finally they got through to their boss who told them to leave us the mulch for free and go back to the office.  it was entirely random.  so we ended up with 6 yards (a hell of a lot) of mulch for free. but it sucks cause now our driveway is half blocked again...

      so last night was fun..  beck and i went up to lake george and met her brother and a few other firemen from becky's fire company.  there was a firefighter convention up in lake george this weekend so the whole town was full of firefighters...  we stopped first at a tent where one company's party had been going on, but by the time we got there it was pretty much over.  we downed a couple of free drinks (who am i kidding...  i didn't pay for my drinks later either - i love being a girl)  before heading into town to go to one of the local bars.  the bar we ended up in was packed, but most of the people there seemed pretty old to beck and i (probably late 20s to mid 30s), but we had a good time.  we got miller light pins from some girl that looked like bottle caps that had flashing leds on it which we pinned to our shirts (which led to some guy later telling me that i had a nice flasher - eww)...  we didn't end up staying there too long which was fine with me 'cause it was really crowded and really smoky and i'd drunk my captain and cokes way too fast...  on the way out some 82 year old (ok, i'm exageratting but he looked old) guy that looked like pop-eye hit on me, which pretty much grossed me out..  we ended up walking around the village with beck's brother and the firemen until beck was sober enough to drive and then we headed home...  i had a good time...  i love lake george.  you can get drunk and wander around town from bar to bar and feel safe the whole time 'cause it's a little resort town.  and it's so nice by the lake.  i really enjoyed camping up there last year...  i hope i'll get to do it again...

      so i hope everyone who reads my page had a happy 4th of July :)  I went to the commons to see the fireworks.  it was hella crowded, but i saw a lot of the girls i used to teach in guard.  they're so cute :)  the fireworks display was nice...  we were really close and they were like, right above us, so when you layed on the ground and looked up it looked like they were coming right at you.  i love fireworks, this is always my favorite holiday.  my favorites are the ones that sound like rice crispies and the ones that spiral and scream, oh, and also the ones that stay glittery for a while :)  i used to be terrified of fireworks when i was little.  i remember going to see them in pottsville and having cotten balls stuck in my ears because the big booms scared me so much.  my 7 year old brother, Alex, was afraid of the fireworks, and when they first started he jumped and sprayed powdered sugar from his fried dough all over me :)  there was a little girl right next to us who kept screaming also, the poor thing was terrified...  then one of the huge fireworks that's supposed to explode in the sky went off on the ground, it was hella scary.  it looked pretty cool, but it definately wasn't supposed to happen (i hope no one got hurt).  after that i spent the rest of the time afraid that something worse would happen (although i tried not to look scared for the sake of my little brother).  and then a piece of cardboard or something fell right next to that little girl who was screaming (which, evil me thought was really kinda funny...)  anyway...  spending the 4th with my family was a first for me in a long time.  when i was growing up i'd always gone to my mom's ouse for the summer, and then after high school i was with tim and we would always be together for the 4th - either camping or at a picnic or something like that.  i was kind of having a hard day yesterday.  i guess all holidays are hard after a break up, but i didn't think that the 4th of july would effect me really...  ah well.  i miss the old tim.  :(   i have to go to arizona this weekend.  my step-aunt victoria, who i haven't seen since i was 12 or so, is getting married.  i guess she also might have cancer, which is why the wedding is so sudden.  my step-grandmother is dying also, so it'll be good for me to go.  i haven't seen my step-grandmother since i was 6 or 7 when my mom and my step-dad (RJ) lived out there also.  I'm not looking forward to this trip.  With everyone dying, it doesn't seem like it's going to be too much fun.  and i don't really know these people.  i will get to see my mom, but she annoys the hell out of me.  she never wanted kids, and she's a horrible mother (i know, that seems rough, but it's really the truth).  she always seems so uncomfortable when she talks to me, it annoys me.  and we were going to take the same flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix, but she switched to another one because it was a "better deal".  that's always the story with my mom... looking for a good deal.  so she saves like $50 or so but misses out on 4 hours that she could have spent with me.  she should want to spend that time with me, that should be worth more to her than money (and money is definately not a problem for her).  whatever.  she sucks.  i hope i don't end up like her some day.  i'll write more about her most likely when i return from my trip...  i'm leaving right after work today and i get back sunday night...  well, here's hoping none of my flights crash.  morelater...  ali

      Why am I such a wimp?  I have  such  a hard time making phone calls.  I've been calling around to see about apartments (unfortunately the apartment building that's right next to where I work doesn't have anything available) and I have such anxiety about it everytime I pick up the phone.  And then when I have to leave a message I sound like an idiot.  Blah.  It'll be amazing if I actually get an apartment considering how wimpy I am.  I'm so afraid to go see them, I don't want to go alone...  I'm going to bring my digicam and take loads of pics so that I'll be able to get advice on which one I choose...  Eric or Becky was saying something this weekend about how people have such anxiety about making phone calls that they'd rather give a presentation.  I don't know about that...  I keep telling myself that I'll get better at it the more I do it, and I'm getting better at work about making phone calls (today, I actually had to be like a collections agent and call people asking them where their payment was), but I'm still hella wimpy about making phone calls on my own behalf...  blah...  morelater

      so i have my pictures from this weekend up at ofoto, you can visit them by clicking  urlLink here .  I had a great trip this weekend...    Friday: I drove out to Poughkeepsie to spend the night at Becky's new apartment.  Unfortunately the trip took twice as long as it should have because of horrid weather and a dumbass who caused an accident.  when i left friday it was pouring buckets outside.  i opened the door to my house and had to edge my way along the garages to avoid getting water dumped on me by our failing drainage off of the roof.  The water doesn't drain to the side of the house anymore, instead it just dumps down off the roof. it looked like the part of the river rapids ride in hershey park where you think you're done and that you might have survived the ride without getting soaked and then you round the corner and there's the sheet of water pouring from a waterfall that runs across the whole 'river'.  so i just decided to run for the car...  i had to run on the grass because the driveway had a couple of inches of water on it (the water just couldn't drain fast enough) and i ended up almost slipping in the mud.  when i got into my car (which of course i'd locked earlier so i had to fumble around with my keys trying to unlock the door) i was  soaked .  it looked like i'd just been in the shower with my clothes on.  i started up the car and flipped on the a/c (and froze cause i was so wet, so i had to turn it off right away) and started off towards the northway.  the rain continued to pour down and driving was tough, and when i got to the main intersection in town the power was out and the streetlights weren't working.  it was sketchy navigating around that intersection.  i trust my driving, it's everyone else i don't trust...  anyway, so i got on the northway and it took me about 15 minutes just to get to the twin bridges (normally less than a five minute trip) and once i passed them the rain completely stopped.  it was real weird...  anyway, so i got to the end of the northway and got on the thruway.  since i was heading south towards the city on a friday, i figured that my trip would be quick and i could laugh at all of the city-dwellers heading up north for the weekend that would be stuck in traffic in the northbound lane.  i was wrong.  i hadn't driven ten miles before i passed a truck with a sign on it that said "be prepared to stop" and when i rounded a bend traffic was completely stopped in front of me.  i sat in traffic for two hours.  apparently a few miles ahead some dumbass woman plowed into the back of a truck and it was blocking traffic going both directions.  it was awful.  and to make it worse, my exhaust needs to be fixed on my car so everytime we stopped (which was like every other minute) smoke emitted from my car and floated past me.  it was hella embarrassing...  by the second hour i was getting a little crazy..  i can't stand to wait, especially when i have no idea how long i have to wait.  i felt completely out of control (something which drives me crazy) and trapped (something which panics me).  luckily i was able to talk to beck on my cell phone, otherwise, i think i would have just abandoned my car and run for it.  by the time i got to poughkeepsie i was starving and after becky gave me the tour of her apartment (which is hella cute, and HUGE) she took me out to dinner at outback.  we ate a lot (and i drank enough to get me a little drunk) and so when we got back to her place we pretty much crashed immediately.     Saturday: Beck and I planned on making the 10:30 train into Grand Central which would put us in the city at 12:19, but we were too lazy to get up in the morning...  her bed (which is a beautiful sleigh bed) was just too hella comfy and neither of us wanted to get up...  so we decided to take the 11:30 train instead... and we almost missed that one.  we haven't once made the train out of poughkeepsie without  just  making it, and it gets closer every time...  this time no sooner had we got on the trian than it started to pull away.  the train ride in was uneventful.  beck and i quoted Ghostbusters to eachother (as usual...  for some reason, every time we get on any form of public transportation, we begin quoting ghostbusters to eachother) and made fun of this annoying woman who wouldn't stop talking to the couple behind her.  by the time we got off of the train we knew that she was a teacher, got thirty minutes of planning time at work per day, and really liked to eat carbohydrates...  when we got to grand central we found eric and sarah right away and then headed into the city..  we walked down madison ave so sarah could show us where her new job is (she started today) and then we ate at a little deli.  beck and i got these great sandwhiches that had turkey, honey mustard dressing and brie cheese on it (yum).  then we headed to brooklyn where eric and sarah live.  their apartment is also adorable.  their dining room is just too cute: they have an old diner table and chairs and then against the wall behind it they have a japanese-looking door panel from a sushi restaraunt that threw it out behind which they have christmas lights.  it's a really cool effect.  then they have chinese screens on the wall and a hanging that they covered the overhead lamp with.  all of the doors in their apartment have crystal-looking knobs, and they have moulding on the walls and around the windows.  in their living room they have a potted ivy that they've draped over a trellis in the corner - it's very pretty...  we watched a great quality downloaded copy of lilo and stitch (i  love  that movie) and then had dinner (eric cooked us pasta and garlic bread).  then we hung out, drinking screwdrivers and playing video games all night.  it was much fun :)       Sunday: We decided on Saturday that we were going to go to the Bronx Zoo on Sunday because there were ads all over the subway for the baby animals at the zoo.  Beck and I had never been there before, and baby animals are cute, so we were excited to go.  We left the apartment around 10am and got bagels from a deli about a block away on the way to the subway.  the bagels were delicious (hot with just the right amount of cream cheese).  The commute out to the Bronx from Brooklyn took a while, but it wasn't too bad.  The zoo was great fun.  I took a lot of pictures of animals ( urlLink see them here ).  The baby animals were adorable...  one of the first animals we saw was a red monkey who was holding her little baby monkey.  he was so cute, picking leaves off of the branch that his mother was holding and eating them.  we also saw some non-cute animals.  there were a lot of spiders there...  and ohmygod they were gross.  there was this huge tarantula that was actually on the front glass part of his cage.  he was disgusting.  there were some other ones that looked like overgrown ones that live in my house and they scared the crap out of me.  i had to leave that exhibit cause i started to freak out a little (in fact, just remembering it now is making me freak out... my neck is so tight, i can't really swallow or move my head...  have to stop thinking of them..)...  the only drawback to the whole day (besides the horrible, horrible spiders) was that it was pretty stinky in some of the houses cause it was so hot out...  the night world exhibit was the worst in that respect...  they had signs warning you about how dark it was going to be, but i feel that they also should warn you about how badly it's going to smell...  it really, really reeked in there...  it smelled like animals (or people for that matter, it was really dark in there) had defecated all over the floors...  We had a nice time walking around the zoo, and we lucked out cause it wasn't too hot outside, and although it looked like it was going to rain we didn't get rained on while we were there...  we didn't leave the zoo till around 5, and we went directly to grand central from there.  beck and i caught the 6:04 train to poughkeepsie which didn't get us back there until 7:45.  i headed home almost right away...  on the way home i stopped at a gas station and bought some oil cause my oil indicator light was on (i drove my car too hard on the way there...  but really, i had to make up all the time lost sitting in traffic, so going 90mph was reasonable).  I popped my hood and tried to unscrew the oil cap, but i couldn't get it off.  i burned my thumb and pointer finger in the process (without realizing it).  i couldn't get the freaking cap off...  when i was about to give up and ask some guy for help i realized that the cap was unscrewed all the way, all i had to do was pull up to get it off.  i felt like a dumbass...  i'm just glad that i didn't ask someone to help me before i realized it, i would have really felt dumb then...  anyway, so now i have a huge blister on my thumb because i'm a dumbass.   so it was a good trip, can't wait to do it again :)   morelater...

      so my bad luck with apartments continues :(    yesterday i called Park Row apartments, which are right down the street from where i work.  the complex is small, about a dozen brick buildings, and the buildings don't look all that great from the outside, but the location is  perfect  and the price is nice ($520 including ht/hw for a one bedroom).  So they said that they'd have a one bedroom available about mid-August, and I said that would be perfect and asked if I could make an appointment to come see it.  She told me to come the next day (today) at 1:15.  so then a few hours later they called me back and said that they rented that apartment, and it didn't look like they were going to have anything until September (and that would be a two bedroom).  but, they said that i could still come today to see an apartment just on the off-chance that something comes open.  So i went today, and it would have been perfect.  it's just the size that i was looking for (not too big, not too small... just right) and it was cute and clean.  so dammit.  so they took my name down and gave me an application and told me to go ahead and fill it out and send it in, and to call back every few weeks to see if something opens up.  i hope something does, cause that would be just  perfect .    sothen when i got home i figured that i should continue to call around (i don't want to put "all my eggs in one basket"  too  small bathroom, a very large living room and a large bedroom.  it was a pretty nice apartment, but it was too expensive: $650 including ht/hw...  then she showed me the studio, which was about the size of the one bedroom minus the living room.  so i'd be able to fit my bed, my desk, my dresser, possibly a table and maybe a love seat, but most likely just a chair in the living/bedroom.  but the price was pretty good: $545 including  all  utilities...  but i just don't think i'd be happy in a studio.  i mean, where would i go with company?  not that i think i'd be entertaining all the time, but still..  and really, it'd feel like a dorm room or my bedroom hear or somthing like that...  so blah...    so now i just hope that a one bedroom comes open at Park Row...  wish me luck... :)  morelater...

      so i went apartment hunting today.   urlLink Click here to see the pictures I took...   i met with eugene, who showed me three of his apartments.  yeah.  they were all holes.  i mean, they weren't as bad as they could have been, but they were all  tiny .  I met him at the building on South Lake street first.  I was excited to see what the apartment looked like, because the outside of the building was cute and it was right across the street from the park.  he had 2 apartments on the 3rd floor.  the first one he was trying to rent for $485.  it was a studio apartment that was just about the size of my bedroom here at home.  the bathroom was a closet originally i think, and the kitchen area was pretty scummy looking.  the room that was the apartment probably could have just fit my bed and pretty much nothing else.   the second apartment was right across the hall.  this one was a one bedroom he was trying to rent for $500.  the bedroom was very very tiny.  i don't think my bed would have fit in there.  the main room was nice, kinda big.  i guess if i rented that apartment i'd end up putting my bed in that room and using the bedroom for my computer/tv area.  the kitchen had a new fridge, but wasn't impressive beyond that and the bathroom was very small.  and to top it off, the hallway up to the apartment was very poorly lit and smelled pretty funky we then headed over to his other apartment which was on madison, about a block from St. Rose.  The location was great, and there was off-street parking, and the house that the apartment in was huge and beautiful... from the outside...  inside it was dark and the ceiling was leaking into a garbage can on the way up the stairs.  the apartment was a one-bedroom, but it was  extremely  tiny. The bedroom was about the size of my queen sized bed.  he kept insisting that it was measured and that any size bed could fit in there, but i think that if i put my bed in taht room it would have completely filled it.  the other room had a nice bay window on one side and the kitchen lined up on the other.  it was extremely small.  i don't think my bed could have fit in that room either, and i think that if i'd put a loveseat in there i wouldn't have room for a table.  so i don't know where i'd go with my computer or tv.  the bathroom had a tub in it, which could have been a bonus if the ceiling above it wasn't rotting into it.  and he wanted $500 a month for that place.  I thanked him for showing me the apartments, but i think he knew that i wasn't interested.  he can rent those to some kids that come up here from long island and who's mommy and daddy are going to pay the rent for them.   I never realized how spoiled i am until i saw those apartments.  i used to think tim was being kinda snobby for only wanting to look at apartments in complexes, but now i see his point.  my dad even admitted that this was one thing that tim was right about.  i should look for an apartment in a complex.  i've found a few that are reletively inexpensive, and compared to what i'd be paying for a shitty student apartment in albany it's really a much better deal.  i'll be able to find a much bigger, cleaner, and safer apartment looking in a complex.  so tomorrow i start calling complexes...  wish me luck :)  morelater

      so i got home about an hour ago, and i'm really not tired, but i better put myself to bed so that i'll be able to get up for work in the morning...  i kept a journal on my palm while i was on my trip, so following are the entries that i wrote...  morelater...   Friday 7/5: 930pm EST  106 degrees.  106 degrees.  that's damn hot.  that's the current temp in Phoenix.  we're about 20 minutes from landing (and it's hella bumpy).  I'm so disoriented because it's 9:25 my time but it's ass-bright outside the window because it's only 6:25 out here.  i tried to prepare for this by napping but it didn't work.  i only succeeded in sleeping for maybe a total of 20 minutes.  it must be ten times worse for my dad when he goes to Saudi, so i should stop bitching...     Saturday, 7/6: 245am EST landing in AZ was weird.  first all you could see was desert.  just sand and small-but-steep rocky, brown mountains as far as you could see.  in the desert you could see roads cutting thru the sand and the occasional trailer.  then suddenly there was the city.  the city of phoenix is all spread out and for the most part just looks hot.  there's no grass (except for sports fields).  as i was noticing all of the sand i couldn't help thinking of the part in episode 2 where Anakin is talking about how he hates sand b/c it 'gets everywhere' and i thought, 'Arizona looks like Tatooine' and then i thought that i was just a big dork. when we got out of the airport & walked into the parking garage it was like walking into the depths of hell.  the parking garage felt like a nyc subway station (except it didn't reek).  mom & rj had to make room in their trunk already b/c they'd been shopping in the few hours they'd been in Phoenix before me.  they shop more than anyone i know.  and they buy things not b/c they need them but b/c they're good deals.  blah we had dinner at rj's parent's house (where the wedding is & where we're staying).  we had Thai food that was pretty good from a restaurant called thaiphoon.  it was nice seeing my aunt victoria again, and the guy she's marrying, willy, seems pretty nice.  he's from Croatia & he's a pianist. tomorrow should be a nice day...  i must sleep now b/c i'm very tired...   Saturday, 7/6: 1110am EST  so it's 11am est which makes it about 8am here.  it doesn't sound like anyone else is awake.  i'm not too anxious to leave this room & have to make small-talk w/my step-grandfather either.  he seems nice enough, but i don't really know what to say to him.  he's spent the last few years watching his wife slowly die before him, and from what i've heard he hasn't really accepted the reality of her situation.  they say it's as if he expects her to magically just get up out of bed and be herself again.  in reality, that will never happen.  he doesn't seem too strong anymore either, and i wouldn't be surprised if after she dies he follows soon after.  it's very sad.  my mom & rj have been coming out here many times in the past few years to try & help out.  well, rj helps out anyways...  my mom sits around waiting to go out & shop, and complains afterwards that it was a very boring trip.  what an insensitive, self-centered bitch.  here her husband is trying to help out his ageing father & dying mother + my mom is worried about how bored she is and that she missed out on shopping. ugh...  anyway...  i guess i'll sit here and read or exercise until i hear someone else up.  morelater.   Sunday 7/7: 345am EST  saturday went well.  i exercised for a little when i woke up (and i'm still sore) and by the time i was done my mom & rj were up.  after breakfast we went for a swim.  my mom took forever trying to decide which bathing suit to wear.  like it mattered.  she ended up wearing a black strapless one that she complained about the entire time we were in the pool.  the pool is pretty cool.  it's an in-ground pool with the deepest part in the center.  i could stand at the deepest part & the water would come right to my chin.  the pool is bordered w/cobalt blue tiles, and there's a hot tub a level up from the pool that spills water like a waterfall into the pool.  the water was warm, but not unpleasant.  i got sun burnt (the 1st time in years) which pissed me off b/c i wore sun block.  we swam until about noon, when we had to hurry & get ready for the wedding ceremony. the ceremony was short, simple, and sweet.  there were a ton of old people guests (including some german doctor who was apparently smitten w/me) and they wheeled rj's mother out for the ceremony.  she didn't seem to be aware of what was going on b/c she just stared at the wall the whole time.  her face seemed to be frozen in a slightly scared expression & a blanket was wrapped around her (but you could still tell that she was nothing but skin & bones beneath there). one of her friends remarked at how vicki (rj's mom) would have loved to be in on all of the action.   it was kinda sad...  at the end of the ceremony rj's dad announced that 'vicki is doing well and is aware of everything that's going on, and her heart is overflowing with joy on this happy day' then she was wheeled back into her room.   after everyone left we (the family) went into the bedroom to see her.  with the blanket off of her you could see that her muscles were very rigid & that her arms were permanently crossed over her chest with her fists clenched.  she really didn't look alive anymore.  rj & his dad talked to her like she could hear & understand them, while she just stared around the room and periodically moaned.  at one point rj's dad said 'ok?' to her + it seemed like when she moaned she was trying to say 'ok' back.  he took that as proof that his vicki was still there.  i guess i'd like to think so too, but that seemed like a more automated response than anything considering her apparent level of awareness.  it just made me very sad, because he's going to such great extents to keep her alive when the vicki that he knew has been dead for a while.  and, what if her mind is still aware in there & she's trapped in her failing body?  that must be the worst kind of torture, especially considering the type of woman that she was.  she was a strong, beautiful, independent & outspoken woman.  i just don't think that she would want to live this way.  it's so sad... later on i went w/my mom & rj to see a movie.  we saw mr. deeds.  it was an ok movie.  maybe it was because i was over-tired, or maybe it was the caffiene high i was on, but at one point i was laughing so hard at deeds throwing cats out of a burning building that i was in tears...  that sounds pretty sick...  well it's late now & i have to get up early to go to brunch...  morelater   Sunday, 7/7: 515pm EST  i'm so annoyed w/my mom & rj...  they have no consideration for others whatsoever...  they had to stop at last chance, this bargain clothing store before they took me to the airport & they made me late (almost) for my flight.  they always get to the airport just in time to board the plane, but i can't stand that.  i get nervous that i'll miss my flight or something.  but no matter how many times i tell them that i need to be there an hour early they always make me late.  the flight's packed, and all that was left was a center seat - i hate center seats.  shouldn't be too bad though, both my seat sharers look like nice, normal people. we went to brunch this morning at the Arizona Biltmore hotel.  the building was very unique - it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  there was a beautiful art glass piece just inside the lobby in his famous circles & lines design that we took pictures in front of. the table we sat at in the restaurant had these beautiful high-backed FLW chairs.  the food was excellent.  they had sushi, shrimp, crab, smoked herring and salmon at one table.  the next table had a (very cute) chef making omelets, and next to him there were waffles, french toast, bacon, sausage, and crepes filled with strawberries, peaches & blueberries.  across the way there was a chef waiting to carve slices of veal or venison, and next to that there was a table filled with fresh fruit (strawberries, blueberries, peaches, pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe, mango, papaya, kiwi) & veggies (marinated portabella & shitake mushrooms, asparagus, artichoke hearts) & assorted breads & bagels.  and finally, there was the desert table...  key lime pie, banana cream pie, chocolate decadence, creme caramel, puffed pastries, cheesecakes, tarts, eclairs, white chocolate covered strawberries, little pots of creme brulee (my favorite), tiny parfaits...  i had such a hard time choosing...  i ate so much, and i had a lot of champagne, so i hope i don't get sick on this flight... the pilot is a freakin' comedian...  he made a joke that i feel was in poor taste about making an unscheduled turn towards dc.  how awful, no one thought he was funny...   Sunday 7/7: 735pm EST  those videos that they show on some flights instead of having the flight attendants give their spiel really crack me up.  the part where the o2 masks come down & the mother calmly + leisurely puts hers on while her daughter patiently waits is just so unreal, it's ridiculous.  i mean, we all know that if those masks come down there's not a person on the plane that's going to be that calm, so don't insult our intelligence.  the other part on that video that cracks me up is when the male flight attendant is modeling the yellow life vest 'that can be found under your seat'.  there's something so vaguely homosexual about him blowing into the red manual inflation tube.   my mom & rj gave me a $20 before i left so on this flight i paid the $5 to rent the headphones so i could watch the movie.  it was 'ice age' on this flight, which was cool cause i kinda wanted to see it, but i don't think i ever would have rented it.  it was a cute movie, there were some funny parts & there was one part that made me tear up (which made me feel stupid, here i am, sitting on a plane w/a bunch of strangers, getting all choked up over a cartoon). i'm bored.  the movie was too short (80 minutes) and there's still about an hour and a half left in this flight...

      so i found a webpage that tells you all sorts of stuff about your birthday...  did you know that today is   Seventeenth of July Revolution Day (Iraq)     Muoz Rivera Day (Puerto Rico)     Constitution Day (South Korea)     National Tennis Month (U.S.) ? also, on this day in 1955 Disneyland, the first theme park ever, opened in Anaheim, CA...    but that's like the only happy thing ever that happened on my birthday..  never fly on my birthday, cause it's always unlucky...  JFK Jr. disappeared in his plane on my birthday, there was a huge horrible commercial plane crash one year that killed lots of people (i think that was the one leaving JFK or Laguardia  anyway, the site also had a little blurb about my astrological sign, Cancer, which said:  Cancerians are nurturing, emotional, sensitive, conservative, and home-loving, much more aware of how they feel than what they think. They are artistic, have vivid imaginations, and have highly developed memories.    that's pretty much true, i guess.  but with my memory, the highly developed part is that it stores everything good, and weeds out and deletes (or represses - whatever) most bad memories.  which is why i don't stay mad at people for long, i can't really remember why i was mad in the first place...   anyway...  i share my birthday with John Jacob Astor and Phyllis Diller (that weird, old comedienne).  so rich people and funny people are born on my birthday.  that's cool, cause i'd like to be both...

      so yesterday i went to lunch with some friends at Fresno's and they embarrassed me by having the waitstaff sing happy birthday to me (thanks carrie).  by embarrass of course i mean delighted, because really everybody complains when people sing to you but secretly enjoys it.  i even got a gift!  :)  they gave me cobalt blue dinnerware that will perfectly match the canisters that i have already :)  i'm very excited to have my own kitchen and be able to use it...  speaking of kitchens, i've decided to paint the table that i bought red.  "cranberry zing" to be exact.  i may decoupage the top of the table, but i haven't really decided on that yet.  but the table will definately be red.  i think a red table will look cool with cobalt blue dinnerware on top.  if i did decoupage the table, i'd use vintage advertisements...  well, copies of vintage ads...  especially liquor ads, because they're hella cool.  i bought a print of one that will go in my kitchen:     I've found a bunch of ads like that online, so i may print them out and use them for my table...  or, i could make placemats out of them, that way i could have them on the table when i wanted them, and if i got sick of them i could remove them...   that's  probably a good idea....    my mom sent me shoes in the mail today.  when we were in AZ i saw a pair of steve madden shoes that i'd been lusting after for a while at that last chance store, but they weren't in my size, but i guess my mom found them in my size on a later trip :)  they kinda look like a cross between running and bowling shoes but they're red and they're clogs.  they're lovely.    I looked at another apartment today.  in the paper it was advertised as $545 but after i saw it and decided it was perfect they informed me that it was $580, which was hella annoying.  and it didn't include any utilities, and it was electric heat, so that would be too much.  ah well.  the search continues....     well...  i'm bored.  but it's too late to go out and start cleaning the table and getting it ready to be painted....  ah well...  my birthday is the day after tomorrow.  YAY!  but...  i'll probably be depressed (and not cause i'm getting older)...  i was watching the history channel earlier and it just made me miss tim...  i used to love to be lazy with him and do nothing but lay in bed and watch tv (especially the history channel or TLC or the discovery channel...)  but i guess that was old tim and evil/darth tim has killed him.  damn darth tim.

      Camping...  continued...  Saturday: so beck and i woke up early saturday because the ground was hard...  we went to the pancake house for breakfast and paid exorbitant prices for decent food.  I had a hot chocolate that came in a large, brightly colored mug with whipped cream, sprinkles, and a cookie...  it looked like a kid's drink (which was kinda embarrasing) but it was really good (it should be, for $2.50)...  then we went shopping at the outlets (yeah, we were roughing it camping...) where becky got two pairs of really cute red shoes.  I've decided that red shoes are lucky for me, so i hope they're lucky for Beck as well...  the one pair was from the nine west outlet and they were hella cute and hella cheap: they're red patent leather high heels and they were only $20...  i should have got a pair as well...  anyway...  Eric and Sarah were at camp by the time we got back from shopping so we all went to price chopper and the liquor store and got "essentials"...  we went to the beach later on where eric and sarah made a turtle in the sand and we all went in the lake...  you couldn't really swim in the swimming areas because even the "deep" part only went up to your knees, and the lifeguards were hella paranoid.  they were blowing their whistles every two minutes telling kids to get away from the ropes etc...  we had a good time though...  later on we went back to camp and made hot dogs (and eric tried to make chicken kabobs that he got at Price Chopper but the chicken chunks were too big and it took forever to cook)...  becky introduced me to Gin and Tonics which are hella yummy and perhaps my new favorite drink (and they're hella easy to make, too).  later on, beck and i walked into the village and got tarot readings done (yeah, they were bad wrong... mine said that i was supposed to get back together with tim <- whatever) and then had an old-time photo taken (we dressed as whores)...  when we got in front of the camera they asked us if we wanted to hold guns, bottles, or cards and i said "bottles" right away (and then we laughed cause it was a little obvious that we'd been drinking)...  we were pretty much on the verge of hysterics when they were taking the pictures...  at one point he asked us to be serious and i was like, "i don't think we can!"  anyway...  the picture came out pretty good (i'll scan a copy and post it with the rest of the camping pics)...  The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful...  we had a great time though :)  maybe we'll go again, but like camp outside of hershey park next time or something...  morelater...

      so camping was great....  i'm going to post the (few) pics i took soon.    Friday:  There was no way that Beck was going to make it on time from Poughkeepsie in the upstate bound traffic to meet me in CP and leave in time to make it to the campsite before 9 (we had to get there by then or we'd lose the reservations).  so we decided that i should go up ahead and set up camp and then Beck would meet me up there.  So I rushed around my house, throwing crap in my car and then ran to wal-mart and bought a lantern and a tent (yeah, i didn't have one until about a half hour before i left to go camping) and then raced up to Lake George.  I got to the campsite at about 20 after 8 and immediately began to set up the tent.  It was hella easy to set up, and it was much cuter than i thought it was going to be.  It has mesh on two sides and the rain fly is clear plastic at the top so you can still see the sky with the rain fly on, and it came with a "gear loft" which could hold a flashlight so you could light the interior of the tent.  I was happy with it, and it only cost me $40 :)  anyway...  so by the time i finished setting up my tent and my cute amazing camping love seat (which i got back from tim...  yeah, there's kinda a story there...  maybe i'll post about that later...) it was pretty dark out.  so i got my new lantern from the car and turned it upside down to put the batteries in - and the two flourescent tubes fell out.  i picked them up and put them back in thinking that it was poorly made, and then i realized that there was a piece missing.  it didn't have a top part which conneceted to the tubes so it wouldn't work.  i was hella annoyed.  so then i had to sit there in the dark alone until beck got there (luckily she brought a lantern) ...  we hung out at the site for a little bit and then walked into the village.  it wasn't far at all, but it was kinda raining and there didn't seem to be that many people out (and the bars were all playing lame-ass slow music) so we went back to camp and sat in the tent drinking and talking until we were so tired that all we were saying was nonsense (i started to tell becky about a hyper hi-liter and then i realized that i was pretty much asleep).   I just got hella lazy and i don't want to post anymore.  blah.  i'll write morelater...

      so i get this daily email with the weather, my horoscope, some news/entertainment headlines and jokes etc, and there's this one feature called news of the wierd and this was in it today:  A paper by psychologist Michel Lariviere for Correctional Services of Canada concluded that most guards don't respect inmates (which inhibits rehabilitation efforts) (May). A $4 million study by University of Buffalo Research Institute on Addictions revealed that employees are much more likely to call in sick if they have drunk alcohol the night before (May). A Harvard School of Public Health survey found that people report more noise and other disruptions in binge-drinking college neighborhoods than in other neighborhoods (July). An Iowa State University study found that TV viewers had a harder time noticing the commercials on shows containing explicit sex than on other types of shows (June).   People get paid to do these studies?  i want that job...  i'll study the effect of winning the lotto on a person's debt...  i volunteer to be the subject...  anyway...  the move begins in earnest today...  did i spell that right?  whatever...  morelater...  :)

      so i'm sitting here bored at work and i did another free tarot reading...  for my past card i got 'the high priestess' which apparently means that actions and conditioning from the past may be affecting the present situation and now may be the time to bring hidden knowledge to the surface.  whatever that means...  my present card was 'death'.  that doesn't seem like such a good thing...  but it symbolizes 'necessary, profound and wonderful change' that 'should not be resisted.'  'the death card instructs us to rid ourselves of old and useless attitudes, ideas, and situations.'  i'm supposed to 'look towards the future with faith not fear', and it says that in the midst of major changes, I feel stuck between the old and the new.  that's actually pretty right on for an internet tarot card reading :)  my future card was 'the lovers' which 'represents all that one would expect--love, friendship, marriage, sexuality, and the tree of life. The Lovers may also turn up at moral and ethical crossroads, representing major decisions, ordeals, duality, short trips and the road less taken. Their nakedness shows their freedom from ego and facade. Often times this card acts as a reminder to be true to oneself. New opportunities and relationships are steps away. Be true to your self throughout and all will work out fine.'  i dunno... that first part sounds promising :)

      so the dave matthews band concert was great :)  becky and i got up to SPAC around 430 or 5 with our last minute tailgate dinner: gin and tonics and sushi...  we got good and drunk before we went into the concert (our drinks got stronger as we got drunker...  all of a sudden a gin and tonic consists of 3/4 gin and 1/4 tonic...).  we didn't listen to the opening band really - they sounded pretty bland from what i heard...  dave was great...  the minute the music started the air got cloudy and the music seemed better :)  when it started to get dark it rained off an on which was a godsend cause it was so freaking hot and humid!  there were some cool lightening flashes too...   The concert seemed short...  dave started around 830 or so, and we were leaving at 1030 (actually, i guess about 2 hours is a good amount of time to be performing...)...  it took  forever  to get out of the parking lot!  It was about 1/2 hour before we were even able to move the car, and then about another hour before we were out of SPAC and on our way home...  it sucked.  the freaks were out in full force...  on the way into spac there was this really annoying girl in a purple hippy dress who was hanging out her car window shouting to people....  then she saw a cop on a horse and got out, ran over to the horse and started petting it shouting, "oh my gawd!  isn't it a gawgeous horse!"  i was like, honey, if you're high already, you should get back in your car and not run up to cops...  anyway...  good times...  morelater...

      so the move went well...  it was hot, which was annoying, but we got the job done quickly...  i was so dirty, sticky and hot by the end of the night...  my first night in my place was ok...  becky stayed for a while and helped me arrange my living room and then we watched saturday night live.  i thought i was going to be scared alone in my place cause it's an old building and i have an overactive imagination (yeah, i was afraid i'd see/hear/imagine ghosts...) but i was ok.  one weird thing: it looks like someone scratched "hi" into the upper part of the bathroom wall a few times, which would be wierd.  becky said that i was just looking at the wall too closely.  i just hope that it wasn't some ghost trying to be friendly and now i ignored him and he'll be mean.  ok, i'm being rediculous, i realize that.  there are no ghosts in my apartment.  (hopefully).   i still have a ton of boxes to unpack.  my kitchen is pretty much unpacked and my clothes are all unpacked, but now i have to unpack and assemble my computer and put away all my books and other assorted nicknacks...  i also have to hang pictures and get a few throw rugs and plants so that it seems more like a home...  my apartment is hella cute to begin with , and it's just going to be so damn cute when i'm all unpacked :) so i don't have cable yet, which means that i'll be going home everyday to watch trading spaces until i get cable (just kidding...  hopefully...)  my antenna picks up pretty decently on my tv, and i probably would be able to live without cable, except for then i couldn't have road runner and there are no dsl services available to me, so i think i'm going to have to bite the bullet and get it.  that means that i'll have to pick up at least one extra shift a month at the hospital to pay for it, which sucks, cause i really hate working there.  but i guess it's worth it to be able to watch trading spaces and surf the internet at high speeds from my own place...  but for now i'll have to get my fill of internet at the office (isn't hard...  i'm always hella bored here...).  i was hosting my page off of my computer, but as you can see i've moved it temporarily...  i'm hosting the page that directs you to this new location from my old url on my machine at work cause the server i use (tiny.exe) is, well, tiny and easily hidden here...  i hope to find a new location for my page - possibly on my brother's server - soon...   the nimo guy comes today to switch over the electricity to my name and turn on the cooking gas.  i have to rush home cause he's supposed to be coming between 1 and 3 and i get out of work at 1.  both of my bosses are out of the office today, so no one would notice if i left 5 minutes early (hopefully).  with my luck if i don't rush home i'll miss him and if i do rush home he won't get there until 3...  whatever.  i have to make some lemonade so i have something to offer him...  :)  i'm nervous about cooking on a gas stove because i've never used one before...  well, here's hoping i don't blow myself up...  i don't have a microwave, so i'm going to have to learn quick...  it's funny, i felt it was more important to buy myself a dvd player for my living room (i have a dvd drive on my computer, but my computer's not in my living room so i was either not going to be able to watch dvds from my sofa or i was going to have to snake a cable down the hall) than to buy a microwave, and the dvd player was $90 while a microwave is like $30 or $40...  ah well...   this was a long post...  i suppose i should at least pretend to do some work for a while... bleh...  morelater...

      so here's what the e3 awards had to say about the sims online:  Is Will Wright a genius? Or is he just the one-man advance team for an alien race, sapping our energies with games that gleefully absorb more and more of our time, until we're helpless to resist their ruthless march toward galactic rule? There's evidence for both in The Sims Online, which takes the sitcom ingenuity of The Sims and turns it into a reality TV soap opera. The fact that it deviates from the sword-and-sorcery games that currently dominate the MMORPG space - not to mention the plethora of sci-fi-inspired persistent state world games coming down the pipe-makes it remarkable. But the fact that it gives you multiple ways to play the game, and cleverly encourages you to play well with others, and explicitly rewards you for it -well, that makes it unprecedented. When The Sims Online launches this fall, it won't be competing with Everquest or Asheron's Call; its competition will be Friends and Everybody Loves Raymond - that's how effectively and uniquely it demands your time and attention. And there are so many brilliant concepts wrapped up in this game that the industry will be studying it - and copying it - for years to come. Resistance is futile.  I've gotta say, i'm a little afraid of this next sims incarnation.  i mean, i can't wait to try it, but i'm afraid i'll be trapped, stuck in simworld forever...  this is not good.

       Sacrifice the chocolate rabbit!   A group of Christian protestors disrupted a pagans' spring equinox ceremony in Lancaster, Calif., in March by blasting their car stereos to drown out the songs and chants of 300 witches and warlocks. What apparently really set off the Christians was the pagans' merry attempt at "animal sacrifice,"which they accomplish by fonduing a candy bunny. When a pagan leader yelled "Sacrifice the chocolate rabbit," the Christians leaped from their cars and advanced on them, but violence was averted. [CNN-Reuters, 5-2-02]

Eww.  that's just gross.  i guess they get up to  4 inches long .  eww.  but now officials in that country want to ban them 'cause if they got out they could spread disease.  ok, eww.  could you imagine, sitting down to dinner somewhere and a 4 inch cockroach crawls past your table?  they said in the article that if pet-owners would like to get rid of their roach they should call the department of livestock.  eww, a bug that's so big, the livestock department has to handle it.  and what do they do?  come to people's houses and stomp on them for them?

      so becky and i went to crossgates last night and saw signs.  i enjoyed it.  we were freaking out the whole time because we heard that it was a real scary movie, but it turns out that we didn't have to freak out that much.  we kept wispering "i'm gonna scream" to eachother and putting down the popcorn lest we throw it...  soyeah the movie is pretty good, it's not what you expected if you went to see a scary movie, but it's better than expected.  it's more about the people in the movie when it's all said and done...  i liked it.  i will most likely purchase it on dvd when it's available previously viewed at hollywood video.    soyeah, when we got back to my apartment we just bummed around and talked for a bit.  the conversation turned towards ex-boyfriends and i expressed dissappointment in the fact that i'd wasted a lot of time on tim.  if i'd have known that he was a cheater ahead of time, i wouldn't have gone out with him.  once they cheat, they'll do it again (sounds like we're talking about dogs or cattle).  becky said that cheaters should have to register, like sex-offenders have to.  then i said, yeah, we should make a website where women can go to it and search through a database to find out if the guy she's considering dating is a cheater or some sort of other huge asshole.  we laughed about it and realized that even though a site like that would be useful and probably sucessful, it would also probably open us up to lawsuits...  i threw together  urlLink this mock site  cause i thought it was funny :)

      YAY!  I have road runner :)  but i'm still not hosting my page from my apartment, cause i don't want to leave my computer on all the time and suck my electricity....   so where it will end up remains to be seen.  butyeah, i'm hella excited that i have internet access from my place :)   school starts next week, and i can't wait.  I feel like such a freak, but i'm so bored not going to school.  i have an orientation night this wednesday.  i'm not sure exactly what they'll be doing.  'hi, welcome to gradschool.  buy your books and get your parking permits' but i don't plan on buying my books there, and i've been informed that you don't really need to get a parking permit at st rose so...  ah well..   i should have gotten cable at the same time.  if i had, i would have been able to watch trading spaces today.  but i thought that i'd go without cause i don't  need  cable.  i have a feeling that i'll be calling timewarner back by the end of the week and that same cable guy will be here next monday to install cable for me and i'll feel like a freak.  ah well.  i wish i could just subscribe to one channel, for like $5 a month or something.  all i really want is tlc.  then i'd have trading spaces and all their other nifty daytime shows (a makeover story, a wedding story, a baby story etc) and then all of their medical detectives-type shows at night...

      so i watched a really good football game today between the university of michigan and the university of washington.  i rooted (is that how you spell that?) for michigan because my mom lives in michigan and i've been to ann arbor...  and the "wolverines" sound much cooler than the "huskies"...  i mean, wolverine is an x-man...  that's pretty much my whole theory of picking a team to cheer for when i don't know either team playing in a game, i pick the one from the state/city that i've visited or the one with the cooler mascot/colors...  that's pretty much a decidedly girl way to pick, but hey, i enjoy football, but when i don't know either team i've got to pick a team somehow because it's no fun to watch a game where you don't care who wins...  soyeah...  it was a great game, really close at the end (29-28 Washington) but Michigan won in the last 6 seconds with a 44 yard field goal (which was amazing 'cause their kickers had sucked it up the whole game)...   I forgot how much i enjoy football, and now i'm  so  looking forward to fall...  i think i want to go to penn state to see a game this fall cause it's something i've  always  wanted to do...  my mom and dad both went to penn state and i always thought when i was growing up that that's where i would go too, but then when it came time i didn't end up applying there...  soyeah, when i was little my mom lived in Furnace, PA which is just outside of State College, PA where the main campus of psu is located (she was attending classes there at the time), and i completely enjoyed being there when i was little...  we went to the creamery and ate peanut butter ice cream (hella good)...  yeahso...  rambling...  morelater...

      so 'cause i had still-frozen chicken in my fridge, i had to make the rest of my zatarain's red beans and rice for dinner.  i'd made the other half of the box last week, and aparently i'd made all of the rice in that batch.  so tonight i had extra-spicey/salty bean soup with some rice.  annoyingly enough, the most of the little bit of rice that was left in the box stuck to the bottom of the pan.  soyeah, that was my exciting supper story...

       urlLink     EWWWW!!!  That ugly, ugly thing was on the canopy of my bed last night.  ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew!!!!!!   ON THE CANOPY OF MY BED!!!!!!   i just can't express how freaked out grossed out panic stricken i was when i saw it.   i have seen this evil bug before.  one time when i came home from an extra shift at the hospital it was on my kitchen door  on the inside  and it crawled - no streaked - by me and i had to flick it out into the porch with a sponge.  another time i saw it on the porch when becky was here, and she went up to it and freaked out when she got a better look at it and it ran.  eww, it runs really fast...  ugh.. bleh...  ew...  yeahso, last night i was laying in bed reading when i noticed it was sitting there on one of my side panels of my canopy looking at me.  it was so hella gross...  after much freaking out and a panic-y phone call to becky i finally mustered up enough nerve to flick it off my canopy using an old shoe.  it flew across the room and into the windowsill.   becky instructed me to spray some sort of poison at it, so i got out the formula 409 and sprayed away...  and the evil thing lived!   and it  ran at me!!   then i absolutely freaked out and sprayed it a bunch more then finally when it looked like it was heading for under (and then up?) my bed i smashed it to a pulp with a shoe.  i thought i was going to die.  i thought i was going to pass out and then it would crawl on me.  ew ew ew ew ew...  ew.  so i looked up centipedes while i was at work today and i found out that 1) they're carnivores (ew) who kill their pray with poison and shove them into their mouth with horrible mandibles. 2) they move extremely fast (yeah, witnessed that) 3) they're common in older houses (great) 4) they're ugly (well, i devised that on my own...) 5) they normally don't harm humans, but if they do, their bite will sting and swell up (oh. my. god.  if i ever saw one of those things on me....) and 6) they eat spiders.  this is a bug so horrible that it eats those horrible horrible ugly disgusting scary evil things.  but now i wish that it had just hung out on my porch so i didn't have to kill it so it could continue to eat any spiders that would try and eat me.  but it was on my bed.  it had to die.  ugh.  ew.  i had the worst time getting to sleep after that episode, i felt a creepy-crawly and i thought it's family was going to come and kill me.  or just crawl on me.  ew.  ew. ew. ew. ew.ew....  and the whole room was filled with formula 409 fumes, so i think i got brain damage...

      so i was supposed to go out last night w/becky but on her way here she got a call (she's a volunteer fireman...  or i guess it would be fireperson or firewoman, but becky's not that picky and we kinda think it's gay when someone gets all particular aout crap like that).  anyway, so she was stuck helping the rest of her fire company try and move a 500 lb man (how do you get to that point?  really.  i mean, really.  eww.) until late and we didn't end up going out, but that's ok because i entertained myself with crap tv and saved a couple bucks by not going out...  i watched the NFL kickoff concert on CBS.  i can't believe they actually had football players walking a catwalk in a sort of fashion show.  it was so entirely gay.  i mean, really.  i don't want to watch football players strutting down a catwalk, i want to see them slamming into eachother on a field...  i think the only way they got everyone to agree was to have the football players escorted down the catwalk by models wearing only football jerseys.  bon jovi was great.  he's still hot.  and they sound great live, unlike some other bands that sound like crap and it's hella dissapointing.  they did some queer thing where they tried to make a connection between 9/11 and the NFL, which i felt was stretched, and it seemed like they were trying to rationalize their being in NYC having a party.  after that was over i watched "married, with children" which i haven't seen in forever because i generally hate that show.  after watching an entire episode last night i realized that my thoughts on that show were completely right and i hope to never watch it again.  then i watched "king of the hill" which was great.  the beavis-like character who's always smoking and talking in monotone cracks me up.  anyway...  adventures in bad television...

       11:55am  work today has been ok, with the added bonus of both doctors going to lunch for the last hour that i'm to be here.  so now i can just relax without having to worry about looking busy.    was just informed by dave, guy who does the billing, that i get free "accidental death and dismemberment" insurance coverage of $3500.00.  so great.  if i get dismembered my dad gets $3500, which sadly is not nearly enough to begin covering my assorted debts.  he should throw a cheap funeral, so he gets to keep most of it.  perhaps he can have me turned into a diamond as in article i found last week...  cannot think of who i'd want to keep me though.  not my mom.  not my sister.  damn.  cannot wait for the day to come when i can put down a significant other instead of my father as a beneficiary.  tim had named me as a beneficiary on his life insurance policy through work.  said i was his fiancee.  he certainly used to like to throw that word around.  ass.  i guess i could have him killed and get bonus money out of the deal because he probably never changed the policy...    have found the best radio station to listen to at work.  i have it streaming over the internet.  it's 99.9 the hawk out of easton, pa.  "classic hits without the hard rock."  i like "the hard rock" a lot but it's probably not appropriate for at work, so this is perfect.  only problem is, i keep getting excited about sales/contests/promotions that i hear on the station and then i realize that these are all occuring somewhere in pennsylvania...   now that song that i can't understand the words is playing...  what are they saying?  i swear its, "wrapped up like a douche" but that's pretty gross, and i'm sure that's not really it.  becky says that it's "wrapped up like a deuce" but i don't understand what that would mean either.  although, she's probably right.  i'll just go on singing douche though...    guy just came to window of my office to check in.  when he left it smelled like really strong gum and faintly of cigarettes and cologne.  just like tim...  i hated that he smoked, but that's just exactly the same way that he'd smell when i'd hug him.  miss old tim.  hate evil, darth tim.  should freakin' let it go.  will stop thinking of it.  now.

      class tonight was ok.  i don't think my teacher likes me.  she may have heard a comment that i made to another student during the break about having an incredibly funny line from a book pop into my head while the prof was lecturing and having to fight from laughing out loud randomly in the middle of class.  that could piss her off, knowing that i apparently think she's so uninteresting that i'm thinking about lines from books i've read.  then when i was talking with some people about trading spaces i noticed her looking at me with what i thought to be a very patronizing expression on her face.  and then during the last part of her lecture i started yawning (through no fault of hers, she was interesting, i just needed more oxygen) and she stopped class early because "people were yawning."  she hates me.  that sucks.  i'm going to have to participate more next time so that she'll like me (that will probably backfire as i'll most likely say something she thinks is stupid or doesn't agree with...)  i've decided tonight to never name anyone susan as they will turn out to be either a) a bitch or b) dumber than bricks.  there's a dumber-than-bricks-susan in my class who kept making all sorts of vaguely off-topic comments about her personal life/experiences.  people like that are so annoying.    there is this guy in this class who i think is pretty good looking, and i noticed him last time also...  he's tall and it's obvious he exercises a lot or plays sports, and he's apparently taught some high school regents course so that makes him probably a little older than me.  we've made eye contact a few times, and if i wasn't so shy (or if i was a little drunk) i'd start a conversation with him...  but i completely didn't tonight when i totally have the chance...  when we were walking out of the building we were practically walking right next to each other, but i didn't say anything...  i'm so disappointed in myself...  driving home, i passed him walking in the same direction as my neighborhood.  becky says that next week i should offer him a ride.  i don't know about that yet.  i mean, he seems nice in class, but he could be a murderer or something.  next class i resolve to sit next to him, or at least say hi during the break.  i must get over this annoying shyness.

      From Tuesday 9/3/02:   4:30pm  am sitting in my car in the middle of the parking lot with my left blinker on waiting for the woman who got into her shitty blue car on the left to back out.  hate following people in parking lots to find parking spaces, but if i didn't do it tonight i'd never get a spot.  she got into her car and turned it on right away, but now she's just sitting there.  class is starting now.  she saw all of the cars combing the lot for spots and stalking people as they strolled to their cars.   it's been 10 minutes now.  cars are going around me.  stop doing that!  she'll never pull out now! finally!!  she's pulling out!  i mean, what  was  she doing?  writing her thesis?  come on lady, let's go.  you've inhabited that spot long enough...  now to class...     4:45pm  had to walk into class (philisophical foundations of education) late.  very embarrassing.  (so is my spelling).  at least my name is at the end of the alphabet, so i didn't miss saying 'here' for attendence.  the prof just asked if i came in late (yes) had to go to front of the room to get paperwork that was already handed out. how am i the only one who couldn't find a spot?  when did these people get here?   5:15  this class definately has the potential to be boring...  i think my prof is a priest.  i can't tell.  he doesn't dress like one.     5:45  ok.  definately a priest.  either that or people just like to call him father gulley.     6:05  bugbites.  lots of bugbites.  all over my ankles.  pants keep brushing them and making them itch.  going to die.  or scratch right through my skin.  don't think about it.  how did i get so many?!  i did go to the country drive in last night for ice cream, but i was wearing long jeans and long sleeves.  it was my damn shoes!  i have billions of big, honkin', but oddly enough perfectly circular bugbites all over my ankles.  viscious, blood-sucking bugs.  what purpose do they serve, really?  spreading disease?  i just remembered an article i read earlier today at work that said 10 - 15 people a year die of the plague in the US.  spread by bugs.  i am suddenly certain that perfectly circular welts indicates presence of the plague.  i am going to die.  at least there's a priest here.      6:10  now we're watching a video, "see dick and jane lie cheat, and steal."  Tom Selleck is the host.  definately of the "three men and a baby" or perhaps "three men and a little lady" era.  his hair looks plastic.  they keep showing him standing next to a crib.  what was the baby's name in that movie?  something british sounding i think...   gotta love all of these late 80s/early 90s styles.  mullets abound!   they just described the area around ithaca, ny as "the rustic tranquility of rural new york state."  ok. i don't know much about ithaca, but i know it's a college town, and i'm thinking it's not really all that rustic.   ok, they just showed a clip from "he-man."  that rocks!  what a stupid looking hero he was.  he had girl hair.  i loved that show.  i liked she-ra more though.  but you couldn't beat that scene in every he-man episode where he was in front of the castle thing with his sword raised above his head...  i think i'm the only one in this class that appreciated the he-man clip.  everyone's so lame.   some girl wearing a tiny jean mini-skirt, a tube top, a ton of makeup and huge hoop earrings just tried to sound smart by saying "how can they morally and ethically conduct an experiment where they deprive the control group of these great programs!  do they get them later on?"  she seemed really insensed (spelling?) that the kids in the control group might be missing out on something.  i just wanted to shout DUMBASS in a big/loud voice.  you couldn't conduct an experiment like they did without having a control group, i don't think she understood what a control group was. the teacher just kind of looked at her and said, "right" and asked if there were any other comments.  people are so dumb.     9:42  i am incredibly pissed.  in my second class we met in the library and had a short lecture, then we were "set free" until a certain time when we were to come back and discuss our topics for our research proposal with our teacher.  we had to draw the times out of a shoebox.  i, unfortunately, drew 9:25.  i waited around till then and then found out that he was running over 20 minutes late, so i had to stay till 9:45 (when class would normally be over) to find out that i'd wasted my time and i'd have to meet with him next week.  i could have been home, watching american idol (you've got to have your trash tv...)

      was reading my posts lately and decided that i need a new format.  posting everything that was going on worked out well for me in the past (would never have found out what a bastard ex-boyfriend really was if hadn't posted everything that i knew to be going on and having those in the know inform me of actual events).  but having started new life as singleton (yes, i just finished reading  bridget jones' diary ) i realized that posting everything may not be so adventageous in the future.  in fact, have recently edited/not posted some of the things was going to post because they don't exactly need to be put up for the whole world to (potentially) see.  so i've decided to keep a journal and post the highlights and interesting/relevent/sharable/humorous things here.  also apparently have decided to omit the pronoun i for some reason from most of these sentences...  this new format will probably seem exactly the same, except for most of the things i post will have been written beforehand and thus timed and dated differently from when they were posted, but who cares.  it'll be different to me. perhaps will follow with revamped look, as am tired of current state of site.

      so.  haven't posted in a while.  i'm lazy.  worked the overnight shift saturday night at the hospital.  i so love working overnight.  i can just sit there alone at the desk and do my work or read or desperately try to stay awake...  that's what it was like at 6am sunday morning.  i wanted to die.  i finally flagged someone down to sit for me while i "went to walk around a bit".  yeah.  i snuck down to the lounge at the end of the hall and slept for 15 minutes.  and when i woke up i was all scared and disoriented.  but i was much better getting back to work.    something weird always happens when i work overnight.  this time there was some woman from room 228 who couldn't sleep apparently because she was up and walking around all night.  she was tall and was wearing a red flowered housecoat and walked with a walker.  the first time she came up to me she wanted me to call her church, our lady of fatima - but not the one in schenectady, the other one - and let them know that she was in the hospital, cause sometimes they forget to tell the parish.  and last time they told the wrong one, and she got visited by the wrong priest.  oh my god.  so i explained to her that since it was 3am i didn't think i should be calling her church and how about she go to bed?  but she stood there and talked and talked and talked until i wanted to die or kill her and then thank god the phone rang and i had to answer it and she left.  then she came back later with a braid of hair.  apparently she had cut her hair and kept it in a braid and she was going to give it to the little girl next door so that she could wear it on her head like a crown.  frankly, i was horrified at the thought of some little girl wearing old lady hair on her head like a crown but all i said was, "that's nice."  she talked some more while i smiled and nodded and wished i could be rude until finally she left again.  i saw her a few minutes later cornering a respiratory therapist down the hall showing her the braid...  later on she was back again with butterfly clips in her hair.  they were glittery and on springs so they looked like odd alien antenna on either side of her head.  at that moment i decided that i will never become old.  i never want to be a lonely, crazy old lady wondering around the hospital talking to people and making them feel uncomfortable or bad for me.    also all night the lady in 212, which is the room directly across from where i have to sit all night, moaned all night long.  and her name was elly, so when people were complaining about her i thought they were talking about me all night and i was very paranoid and thought they were being very rude talking about me right in front of me like i couldn't hear them until i realized that they were saying elly and not ali.    also the guy in 209's heart rate kept dipping down to like 38 which scares the shit out of me especially when they're not a dnr, so i had to keep calling down the hall so that the nurse could go in and check on him at which point he would wake up and his heart rate would climb back up to 60 until he fell asleep and it would slowly slide back down to 38 and we'd start the process all over again.  i wanted to just shout "dude, wake up!" into the intercom into his room every time that happened, but i didn't think that would be very professional.  one of the amazing residents asked, "who's that?" while he was watching the monitors over my shoulders (always makes me uncomfortable, especially when i obviously haven't been paying attention, or i've been reading/doing homework) and when i told him who it was he said, "oh.  he was in the unit.  he's dying." and then left.  i was disturbed by that.

      I decided to walk down to school today to pick up my loan refund check.  The walk was very nice, except for the one part where I have to walk past this huge, creepy, old apartment building.  When I got back, this long-haired cat with a fucked up ear was sitting outside of my building.  I saw him on the way out and gave him some love, so when I saw him in front of my building upon my return I gave him more love.  But then when I went to open the door he made it clear that he was coming inside.  I didn't know what to do, so I figured that I'd go in the vestibule, and if he followed me I'd try and make him go back out.  Well, that was impossible, he walked right up to the second door and started pawing at it like, "let me in."  So now i'm like, great, what do I do?  I mean, he most likely belongs to someone in the building because what cat would just walk in like that if he didn't live there.  And he looks like he has an owner because his fur is all nice and he has stiches in the one ear.  So I just pretended not to see him walk in.  Then he kinda started walking down the hall so I quick got into my apartment before he could follow.  I think (hope) he went to find his owner's apartment.  I hope he actually lives in here, I don't want to be "that girl that lets strange animals in the building."

      talked to the good looking guy in class last night (as i resolved to do last week).  found out that he teaches history at a local catholic military school that he also attended for high school and played football for.  (i love football - i think i've discussed that before...)  i mentioned that i went to shen for hs and he said we beat them his senior year when our qb was fitzgibbons (i think that was my junior year).  would love to play tackle football with him ;)  also found out that he does live right in my neighborhood.  i'm just impressed with myself for starting a conversation...  shyness can be overcome.

      went to the grocery store for the first time in a month yesterday.  they say to never go to the grocery store while you're hungry because you'll end up spending more than you planned.  couldn't help but go hungry as i had absolutely no food in my house.  spent $86.81 on just food for just little old me.  that's insane.  i did buy a few things that i won't have to buy again or for a while: a garlic press, hand soap for the bathroom, mayonaise, ketchup, balsamic vinegar...  but the bulk of the money was spent on food.  better make it last.  when i got home, i gorged myself into a happy full feeling.  it is so good to have food again.

      went to the bookstore at school yesterday right after work to buy the book for last night's class so i could get my reading done.  i wasn't really paying attention while i was driving and after i got to the 2nd light i started to turn left.  immediately realized my mistake: generally i go to school from my house, so turning left at the 2nd light is correct.  unfortunately, turning left at the 2nd light from work is not correct.  in fact, it's very wrong, i was now headed the wrong way down a one way street.  i fortunately had realized my mistake quick enough and there were no cars parked on the right side of the street so i pulled over and, oddly enough, tried to hide.  after i calmed myself down a little bit i tried to figure out how i was going to get out of this situation.  there were, of course, cars streaming down the street at me providing no break in which i could quickly turn around and get back onto madison ave.  so i did what i generally always do lately in a time of crisis (see bug attack post of a few weeks ago), i called becky.  after she laughed at me (hell, i would of done the same) she pointed out that anybody around me didn't know me, so what did it matter?  this is true, except that i wish it had been a lot of people that knew me around.  then i could laugh with them at my stupidity.  but these people would be just laughing at me.  not so good.  after freaking out on the phone for a few minutes i finally saw a break in the traffic and pulled out and turned around.  tres embarrasing.  then i hung up the phone because i didn't want to be that girl that not only obviously can't drive as evidenced by her trip the wrong way down a one way road but who also talks on her cell phone while driving (which is, of course, illegal in the state of NY)

      when the power went out in my class, i couldn't help but immediately think of what time of year it was and wonder if there was something going on.  seemed as though i was the only one in my class that felt that way because everyone just sat there like it was no big deal, the power goes out in public buildings all the time.  couldn't help but sit there and think the worst and hope that someone would call me if something horrible was happening.  it was unnerving to walk into the dark hall and have the security guards rushing us out of the building.  then seeing the firemen walking by...  rationally i'm aware that nothing will likely happen tomorrow...  i was just unnerved by the changing alert status etc watched the dateline special while was on the phone with becky.  i feel so bad for everyone who lost someone last year.  tomorrow is going to be hard for them.

      had a not so great start to my school night today.  got to class a few (3) minutes early to find everyone else already sitting there filling out a survey.  when do these people leave there houses?  why am i  always  the last one there, even when i'm early?  class started and i quickly discovered that i had neglected to do the homework.  was supposed to bring in pictures from magazines illustrating different types of philosophies.  had to hide against the back wall pretending to be completely interested in everyone elses work.  felt like a complete idiot.  obviously father gulley noticed i didn't contribute at all.    second part of class was a video lecture by howard gardener on multiple intelligences.  was actually interested in watching lecture, so of course the power randomly went out.  sat in semi-darkness waiting for power to return for 10 minutes before father gulley decided that it was a sign to leave.  got into dark hall lit only by security lights to have security guard walk up behind me and yell "building's closed" and make me jump out of my skin.  followed the stream of students outside the building to wait around trying to decide if later classes were to be held.  was informed by passing fireman that classes were cancelled, but didn't believe him.  i don't know why, really, i mean, there was a  fireman  in gear on campus.  generally that means something's gone awry.  followed a group of students who were in my second class also to library to seek out professor to see if we were having class but he was out to dinner.  we decided to wait around for a while.  there were tons of kids milling about campus.  by the gym there was a group of unusually tall young men who i thought were probably basketball players or something like that who were hanging out trying to act all cool while the young undergrad girls in tank tops walked by.  but they were disrupted by the appearence of a bee which made them scatter and yell like little girls.  it was really a funny site, especially because the bee was a giant carpenter bumble bee that doesn't sting.  some smaller guy walked by and informed them as such, and they shrugged off their fear and slowly returned to their bench.  wish i had a video camera...    my teacher for tomorrow night came walking by and informed us that there was a transformer fire somewhere on western avenue, and that all of the buildings were losing power one by one and that classes were cancelled for the evening.  after that some frazzled-looking administrative type person came walking by with official notices and tape sticking out of her mouth (odd that she carried these things in her mouth, really, because she did have a free hand) and informed us 'officially' of the cancelling of classes.  was happy to not have to go to second class, but annoyed that i spent all afternoon worrying and working on crap for it only to have it cancelled.  also am now annoyed that i'm randomly home on a tuesday night and  that 70s show  isn't on b/c of baseball.

      so in class tonight we were talking about prenatal development and the prof said that the higher the age of a woman, the greater chance there exists of birth defects. he said that this was because the woman's eggs begin to deteriorate (can't spell) after a certain age.  so, i'm thinking, ok your eggs begin to rott.  eww.  then he says that the peak time for a woman's eggs is between the ages of 15-25 (i forget what the bottom number was, but the top number that he said was 25) and then i'm like, great.  i have 2 years before my eggs begin to rott.  more pressure.    then, at the end of class the prof says "we've been having some security issues in the parking lot, so i'd strongly suggest you find someone to walk with or call security for an escort." now i'm freaking out.  great.  in 2 year's i'll have rotting eggs and right now i'm going to get raped.  what a stressful class...

      i was just reading what i wrote in my journal 2am sunday (after getting back from going out) and i can't figure out why i felt the need to write anything in my drunken state.  it's very hard to read...  we (becky, her brother alex, and i) went to see a double feature of spiderman and men in black 2 saturday evening, and afterwards we went to the hill street cafe which is really a bar but it's called a cafe.  the music was decent (there was one of those touch screen juke box thingys there and most people didn't play suckage although there was an awful lot of grateful dead) and the fries with gravy were excellent as far as i could tell (but i was drunk by the time they got to us).  i think i was the only one of the three of us that got drunk 'cause i was drinking gin and tonics and they were drinking beers...  anyway, so when i got home i guess i felt the need to recap the evening in my journal, and the writing is just too funny.  i rant for like a page and a half over how awful kirstun dunst looked in spiderman and how if i were her i'd kill the hair/makeup person.  i mean, really, she had no upper lip in most of the scenes.  and the shade of red was all wrong for her skintone, she just looked sick.  when i brought this up to beck and her brother alex said that she was supposed to look girl-next-door and not over the top hot.  yeah.  well.  girl-next-door shouldn't mean sick looking with no upper lip and constantly squinting.  my other writings from that night are about this couple who was sitting across from us at the bar.  they were kind of dressed the same: jeans and white shirts, and the girl was all over the guy.  she was on his lap at one point.  then some fat guy came over and started talking to the guy and the girl seemed to lose interest...  we couldn't believe the guy didn't just tell the fat guy to go away.  then later when the girl was back on his lap again the fat guy asked the guy if he could sit on his lap too..  the couple left shortly after that (although we were speculating that the guy waited too long and now the girl was just going to pass out).  i went to sleep then, but everytime i woke up during the night i felt the need to write more...  it's kind of interesting watching my writing get more coherent as i sober up...

      so beck got me thinking about tattoos...  she sounds like she's definately getting one, and she sent me a link to  urlLink tattoodles  where she found some pretty cool looking celtic designs (she liked the ones in celtic p13 and 15).  I looked at the ones she liked (pretty hella cool), and i started looking around trying to pick what i'd get if i was going to get a tattoo..  i always thought that one on the small of my back would be cool...  it's a good spot.  completely nonvisable in a professional setting, but when you want it to be seen, it's not hard to show it off.  and really, the concept of me having a tattoo would probably really shock people, and i love that.  i realize that the impression that i give off when i don't know people very well is that i'm shy and nice.  and that's true, to an extent :)  i am shy.  but lately, i've been getting over that.  and i'm nicer than most people, when i want to be...  coming off as sweet and innocent has always worked for me...  but i love surprising people when i bust out with something that they completely thought i'd never say/do/etc.  i've even been surprising myself lately...  like with actually wanting a tattoo...  i really like the tribal butterfly designs found on  urlLink tattoodles  tribal section pages 6, 21, and 24.  i can't decide which one i like the most though...  check 'em out and leave me feedback...

      beh.  finally finished with the paper.  so glad to be done with that so i can goof off again...  actually, i have something due for tomorrow evening, but hey, I have all day tomorrow to take care of that, don't I?  soyeah...  this weekend was pretty cool.  got to go out friday night (to the parting glass in saratoga) and had a good time...  beck and i went with her brother (alex) and their friends steve (a state trooper) and (matt) neary.  the drinks were good, but i'm not all that into irish music...   alex and i had that white stripes song, hotel yorba (1,2,3,4, take the elevator at the hotel yorba i'll be glad to see you later, all they got inside is vacancy) stuck in our heads all night (it was on in the car on the way to steve's) but we didn't know all the words so we'd just start singing it periodically and bouncing our heads around and beck would get all weirded out cause she didn't know that song...  the next night i played it for her so she could get it stuck in her head too, i'm such a good friend... it's such an insidious song, you can completely forget it and then all of a sudden it pops back in there and doesn't leave... afterwards we stopped by the troop station to take breathalizer tests.  i can't believe cops do shit like that in their off time...  :)  so kinda supertroopers...  soyeah...  breathalizers sound like those wierd whistle toys that you used to get as prizes at fair games...  it's just too funny that they sound that weird, i'd freakin crack up so bad if i was ever really given one (i mean, they know you're drunk when they're giving it too you anyway...) so after we confirmed that we were drunk we went to steve's house...   i didn't get much sleep that night...    i didn't sleep when i got home either so i was really out of it pretty much all day saturday...  beck, alex and i went to the fireworks that evening in halfmoon (it was 'halfmoon day'), which were pretty cool...  the fair part was pretty lame.  they had some weird game where they put a rat on a flat wheel with a bunch of colored holes around the outside of it.  then they spun the wheel while the rat was covered with a basket and let the rat out midspin.  then the rat would wonder around the table until he found a hole he liked and crawled in...  the point of the game was that people bet on the color of the hole that the rat would climb in.  what a weird carnie game.  beck was pretty offended for the rat.  she said she was going to call the aspca on the carnie, but alex pointed out that she probably saved that rat from medical testing and i said that the rat is her entire livlihood, so no action was taken :)  afterwards we went to starbucks for a round of caramel machiattas and then went to my parents' house (where i was spending the night) to watch supertroopers.  that movie is just too freaking funny.  it was the first time beck had seen it, and she loved it also, and now she owns a copy...     soyeah, sunday i went to a pancake breakfast that beck's fire company was having to laugh at her being a waitress but she wasn't waitressing so i couldn't laugh...  her grandmother made applesauce for the breakfast, and it was  hella  good....  then i went up to fresno's to meet the usual sunday group for lunch and afterwards went to crossgates where i almost forgot about bringing my dad to the airport so he could go to saudi arabia...  had to speed home and pick up my dad...  we had to stop at staples on the way to the airport so he could pick up a graphing calculator for his friend in saudi's son (apparently those calculators are much more expensive over there) and when my dad asked the guy at the counter for it he looked at me and said, "For high school?"  how annoying.  that guy not only thought that i was in high school, but that i had to bring my dad along with me to staples to help me buy a calculator.  eww.  i mean, come on.  i know i'm kinda young looking, but i don't think i really look like i'm still in high school.  and eww, if i had to buy a calculator, i wouldn't need my dad to help me >:(   soyeah, after i dropped my dad off i swung back by clifton park and picked becky up and we drove around for a while listening to my just recorded hella good minidisc.  has all great songs on it.  including puddle of mud's "she hates me."  that song just freaking kicks my ass.  i don't know why i love it entirely...  maybe because it's kinda refreshing for some guy in a song to be all distracted by the fact that he got dumped.  or maybe it's because he says 'she fucking hates me' and it sounds cool...  i dunno.  anyway, i love that song...

You are the idealistic social dreamer. Your overriding goal is to solve the people problems of your world. You are a social reformer who wants everyone to be happy in a world that you can visualize. You are exceptionally perceptive about the woes and needs of humankind. You often have the understanding and skill to readily conceive and implement the solutions to your perceptions. On the positive side, you are creatively persuasive, charismatic and ideologically concerned. On the negative side, you may be unrealistically sentimental, scattered and impulsive, as well as deviously manipulative. Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms.  It's kinda sick that I enjoy that it says that I'm deviously manipulative...

      so i had the weirdest dream last night (well, this morning really...):  it started out on a sunday and i was at church.  it didn't look like my church, but it seemed normal to me in the dream.  i was apparently supposed to sing with some group (weird, i haven't been in a chorus since high school) but only this other guy and i showed up to do it.  so we're in front of the church and we're all embarrassed because we don't want to have to sing alone.  and then people start telling us that we'd make a cute couple and that we should date, which really embarrassed us.  i don't think this guy in my dream was anyone i know in real life, but in my dream world he was someone that i'd hung out with before with friends and he was a little younger than me.  he was kinda cute though and we held hands.   then the dream shifted and we were at my parents house in what was my room.  in the dream i knew that i had my own apartment, but apparently i was also keeping half of my stuff at my house in my old room.  anywhere so we were there napping and we realized that my room was on fire.  so we got out of the house but i had to keep going back and screaming at my brothers to get out of the house.  then we were in the backyard and my neighbors were just watching us in the backyard with our house burning and i couldn't believe that no one was doing anything.  at first it was just a little fire in my room, then the windows were like bursting and pretty much the whole house was in flames.  So i kept trying to call for help.  the first time i dialed 911 it didn't work or i couldn't dial it right or something, and then the next time it went through but i got this dispatcher that didn't want to help me.  she was like, "hello?" and then didn't say anything and i'm freaking out into the phone and she's not really saying anything.  so i hung up and called back right away and got a different dispatcher and she was like, "oh she's heartbroken" as if that explained why the other one wouldn't help me.  then i'm yelling at this woman that my house is on fire and she didn't really seem to care and i'm like, "you have to get the fire department!" and i think i actually screamed something about it being a "working structure fire" which is funny 'cause i only know that term from knowing my friend Beck who's a fireman and then she said "they're already there" and i turned around and there was this (hot) fireman walking towards me asking if everyone was ok.  and the fire was put out in my house, it was all charred and wet looking, but only in the upstairs bedroom part.  so then i tried to call Beck but i only got her voicemail (and it was weird because in my dream i kept trying to dial the phone but i'd dial the wrong number).  then my mom got home from the store with a bunch of bags of coke and she was serving the firemen like there was nothing weird about being at the store and coming home to have your house all burnt and serving firemen coke.  and then i went in my house and the whole downstairs was fine, just a little dirty and smelly and everyone was sitting in the living room talking about how it must have started.  it was really just an odd disturbing dream that ended abruptly (thank God) because Beck was calling me this morning.  anyway.  I can't believe how much of it I remember.  i think the uninterested dispatcher part was weird, and it may have something to do with how someone i know knew someone who didn't pass the psych eval to be a 911 dispatcher and i was told that story on saturday i think and we said how i guess you'd have to be stable to be a 911 dispatcher 'cause otherwise you might hang up on people or something...   i dunno.  i'd welcome any dream interpretations :)

      so...  more on the weekend...   Saturday:  I volunteered to help out at work Saturday morning by going to the department of corrections and setting appointments for people who were applying to be correctional officers to have psych evals.  It was pretty boring, but hey, it was an extra $40 and I got to leave early...  The weirdest people apply to be corrections officers.  There were some kids there that looked like they were maybe just out of high school or community college, and then there was this like 50 year old lady who complained about everything...  I was the only young person working there.  I worked with Dave from the office (who's probably around 50), a really nice if somewhat odd guy, and two older ladies that apparently work at the department of corrections full time.  They were so demanding of the applicants: "Come over here first!  There are TWO lines here!  You didn't fill that in.  Go over there and finish it!"  When the applicants came over to the table where I was sitting they came to me if they wanted their appointments to be in Rochester or Harlem, and they went to Dave if they wanted Albany.  It was weird.  People kept apologizing to me that they went to Dave instead of me.  Like I cared.  I just wanted to get out of there so I could go to Irish Fest.  Also, I really wanted to apply bacitracin to my tattoo which apparently was oozing ink onto the back of my shirt (eww): there was an outline of my butterfly on my shirt when I got home (I hope that comes out in the wash...).  I was wearing my awesome red Steve Madden shoes and some big biker looking guy with a cool Celtic cross tattoo on his forearm complimented me on my shoes.  Really, those shoes are magical or something.  I mean, how many times does a guy actually notice your shoes?  And most of my compliments from those shoes have been from guys...  anyway...  so Dave let me go home early, which made me very happy.  I went right home and got ready to go to Irish Fest.    I had to meet Beck, Alex, Steve, Neary and Lee (the group that went out last weekend to the Parting Glass) at the parking lot at Crossgates across from Hooters where we were supposed to get the shuttle to the festival.  But when we got there we weren't sure if that's where it was really picking us up, and then we found out that you could no longer buy the wriststraps there for admission to the shuttle.  So Steve ended up taking us all to the fairgrounds in his truck.  We had a great time...  Alex got a huge order of fries for everyone to share and I picked at them making the only things I ate that day an apple and a few french fries.  So, it didn't take much beer to get me drunk.  I find that this is a good, inexpensive solution for me...  I'll have to remember that for the future.  Anyway...  So unfortunately my ex-boyfriend was there with the woman that he cheated on me with, but it didn't really bother me.  He tried to get me to see him kissing her, but I ended up not seeing (Beck told me) and I think that's funny.  He's so pathetic.  Later he was standing by this one pavillion where I was watching some musical acts (very good) and Beck was talking with a bunch of the guys that we came with and some others.  I was standing with (well, leaning on...  I was already pretty drunk) Alex and I didn't see him, but Beck did and pointed out to the guys that she was standing with that she didn't like that guy and they all stared at him and he ran away.  What a wimp.   So the bands that I saw were all pretty good.  The first one that we actually watched was  urlLink Kilbrannan  which is from Syracuse.  They wore kilts and did a lot of kinda traditional music.  Then they busted out the bagpipes and an electric guitar and did this hella rocking version of "Scotland the Brave" which I can't find a recording of online, but I'd love to get a hold of.  Afterwards there was just one guy with a guitar who was pretty good.  He did a bunch of interactive-drinking songs that were funny (and difficult to perform as they went on).  Then we went to the Grove Stage and saw  urlLink Hair of the Dog .  They were awesome.  They're a local band so we'll get to see them often if we want.  It started pouring during the middle of their second set, but nobody cared.  The music was too good and the listeners were too drunk to do anything but continue to dance.  They did this awesome song called "I Used to Work in Chicago" that's hella funny.  I was trying to provide a link on here from which you could download it, but it just wasn't working for me.  So try searching Kazaa for it and download it, or you could try im-ing me and asking me (nicely) for it, cause it's really worth a listen :)  When Hair of the Dog was done just about the whole population of the festival walked to the parking lot.  It seemed like everyone left then.  We felt bad for Steve 'cause we had to pile into his car all wet.  Beck got clothes tossed to her, but I didn't get any and I froze the whole way home.  When we got to Steve's I was given a shirt from Alex and some shorts from Steve and I felt much better.  The next morning when I got home though, I felt a little wierd...  My sandels got ruined the night before so I ended up walking into my apartment in an obviously borrowed T-shirt, boxer shorts and in bare feet in front of a few of my neighbors.  That was a little embarrassing...  Ah well..  Soyeah, Saturday was a great time :)     Sunday:  Sunday Beck came with me to meet the usual crew for lunch.  We went to the American Cafe in Colonie center where we partook of good food and great bread :)  After walking around the mall for a little while Beck and I came back to my apartment where we fell asleep :)  My couches are too comfy...  Then we watched Sex and the City and ordered Chinese food.  The whole weekend was just such a great time.  It'll be a while before we get to do it again, 'cause I'm going away this weekend and Beck's going away next weekend...  beh.  Ah well.

      what a great weekend :)    Friday: beck and i got tattoos.  beck came directly here from work and we headed right down to lark street to the  urlLink "lark street tattoo company"  to do the deed before either of us chickened out.  it's probably a good thing we went early anyway because otherwise we probably wouldn't have gotten in.  we were  hella  nervous going in the shop and we didn't really know what to do when we first got in there.  so we looked through the books of flash (the stock tattoo images) that they had there and waited around until one of the artists was done.  at first i told beck that she had to go first and she had to do the talking since it was her idea, but when the girl came to the counter i jumped up right away and was like, 'hi, i'd like to get a tattoo' and i took out the pic of the butterfly that i wanted and told her that i wanted it on my lower back.  beck was like, 'dammit, i wanted to go first!'  i explained later that i realized that if i didn't just do it then i would never have done it.   so in order to tattoo you, they take your design and make a carbon copy of it, then transfer it to your back.  from there it's just tracing and filling in.  my design was pretty simple and i got just black so it wasn't a lot of work.  my artist, kara, said she was going to do one line and if it hurt too much or whatever she could stop.  so she did it and it didn't really feel like anything at all so i was like, 'bring it on!'  and then she started...  well...  when she did that test line, she must have picked the part of my back that she knew would hurt the least, 'cause once she got started it hurt.  not so bad most of the time, but whenever she was near my spine it really hurt.  and then there were times when she was filling in and moving the gun back and forth really quick, and that did not feel so good.  so she didn't really talk while she was doing it, and i was busy breathing and imagining that giving birth must be fucking hellish because this was bad but that must be worse.  i had no idea how long it was going to take and she wasn't really giving me any updates so i just sat there imagining the worst.  i swear, i thought she made it HUGE or something.  she was up in my shoulder blades one second, down my butt another...  well, i'm exaggerating.  it turned out to be not too big, but very cute.  beck got hers started right about when kara was finishing mine up.  beck's artist was named 't-bone.'  he was a big guy with dreds...  but beck said he was pretty nice.  here are pics of our tattoos:

      so when i was in starbucks yesterday i noticed that there was this (slightly) weird guy who kept taking pictures of me.  at first i thought that he was playing with his camera, but no, he was taking (or trying to take) pictures of me.  very odd.  i figured that it was for some class and that he was going to make some social commentary out of me, which kind of pissed me off.  but then i started thinking that perhaps he was a spy (a bad one i guess if i noticed him) and someone needed pictures of me because somehow i figure into some international plot.  or maybe when i go to sleep at night i actually get up and go do nefarious deeds or perform spy duties and then i return to bed and wake up in the morning not remember what went on that night (which would explain why i'm always so tired)...  yeah. that's weird, i know.  sadly, it's not the first time i've had odd daydreams like that...  in fact, i do that all the time.  that's the way my mind works...  it was nice to have physical evidence for a change :)

      so last week i had this incredibly detailed dream and one of the major things that happened was there was a fire in my house, especially in my bedroom.  ( urlLink see the post from Thursday, 9/26 ) so i got bored (what else is new, really?) and decided to try and find a place online that would interpret my dream.  i found  urlLink dreammoods.com .  here was their interpretation of fire in a dream: "Depending on the context of your dream, to see fire in your dream can symbolizes destruction, passion, desire, illumination, transformation, enlightenment, or anger. It may suggest that something old is passing and something new is entering your life. Your thoughts and views are changing. In particular, if the fire is under control or contained in one area, it is a metaphor of your own internal fire and inner transformation. It also represents your drive and motivation.  To dream that a house is on fire, signifies passion and loving companions."  so i figure that the fire in the bedroom symbolizes my realization that i'm completely over Tim and my readiness for something new (although not a new relationship...  just something new.  just being single and having fun for a while...).  so what seemed like something really stressfull in the dream was actually a symbol of something great!  So then I saw that (hot) fireman in my dream and at  urlLink dreammoods  they say that "To see a fire fighter in your dream, signifies long lasting friendships" and I saw that fireman in my dream right before I tried to call Becky.  i'm fascinated with how right on that dream interpretation was...  i hope i remember what i dream of tonight so i can interpret it...   this is my new obsession! :)

      So I've been trying to find out what my name means and I'm getting all sorts of different answers.  My mom brought back this bookmark from Hong Kong for me and it says that my name consists of 3 traditional chinese calligraphy characters which mean "someone special, beauty, and trustworthy."  I got three good ones :)  So I wondered what my name means, where it came from etc. and I found a bunch of different answers.  First I went to  urlLink the parenthood.com website  where they have a big database of names and meanings etc and I typed in 'Alison' and it told me that my name is German and it means, "noble and kind."  That's ok, but it didn't satisfy me.  So then I had to try another site.  I went to  urlLink makewayforbaby.com  where they also have a big database, and when I typed in 'Alison' it gave me a bunch of different answers.  First it said it was Scottish, a form of Louise, which means "battle, famous."  Then it said it was German, meaning "sweet."  As an Irish name my name apparently means "honest."  And as an English name it's actually a guy's name that means "son of all."  According to  urlLink babynamenetwork.com  Alison means "the light of the sun" in Old English and it can be a boy or girl's name.  My nickname, Ali, means "exhalted or noble" and could also be for a boy or a girl.  It's really weird how you can get a ton of different meanings for one name...  i remember when i was younger i found my name in a book and i told my dad how it said that my name meant, "little truthful one" and he said that's because i tell little truth.   I also looked up Rebecca to see what Becky's name meant and it said "Captivating, Knotted Cord" which I thought was cool 'cause the tattoo that she got was a Celtic Knot...

      yet again i've spent my whole day wasting time and doing nothing productive.  i have an assignment due tonight, and i half-assedly did it and i suck.  what's really annoying, is i'll get full credit for the crap i'm handing in.  i'm so not motivated to go to school anymore.  i hate school.  school is boring.  what am i going to be when i grow up?  a teacher.  there's something fucked up right there.  it's so bad.  all i want to do is... nothing.  i don't know.  i just want to have fun.  or just do nothing really.  i'm really good at both of those things.  what i need now is to find a job where i could put my unique talents to work.  here's what i'm excellent at:  *wasting time *putzing around on the internet *daydreaming *shopping *finding excuses to waste time/shop/do nothing when i should be doing something *looking innocent *being bored *researching anything that interests me but nothing that's useful...   there's more, but i have to get dressed and go to class.  soyeah, if anyone has any ideas about how i can apply my talents in a field that's lucrative give me some comments down there...  yeah.  if not, i'm just going to have to win the lotto or find myself a sugar daddy because this working crap is just not working out for me...

      so since i've gotten home from school i've done nothing but waste more time taking emode tests...     urlLink my inner rock star is Britney Spears:   "Feel it, sweetheart; the rock star in you is all Britneythe envy of cheerleaders everywhere. One part girl next door, one part naughty sex kitten, you're definitely not as innocent as you look. And that is why nobody can get enough of you. You are the ultimate American girl with some serious staying power. Unlike other success stories, you and Britney are more than just a pretty face: you've got talent, confidence, and the brains to back it up. With a talent list like yours it's no wonder you're at the top of the popularity charts and young men's hearts. We love you. Shout out your inner Britney!"      urlLink My 'monster match' is a ghost:  "You're a fun loving prankster, always with a joke up your sleeve. That's why your monster match is a ghost. Your bag has more tricks than treats, but you can take it as well as you can dish it out. You're a witty spirit who loves a good hoot, and echoing laughter like you'd hear in the halls of a haunted house. Part ghoul, part Beetlejuice, you are the ghost with the most, the phattest phantom, a real graveyard smash. Whether you're going to a costume party or throwing your own BYOB sance (Bring Your own Ouija Board), you mingle with different social groups as if walking through walls. But you ghosts take care. You love getting a good behind-the-door scare almost as much as you love giving them, but those with bad tickers and tempers might not appreciate your spooky sense of humor. Use your inner poltergeist sparingly and you'll never have to worry about getting 'busted.'"    urlLink My inner 'friend' is Monica:  "Mon! You're the normal one, honey, in the best way possible. You're caring, you're responsible, you look to the futurewhat a gem. Wait a second, did you just start editing for grammar mistakes in the middle of reading your own compliments? Ok, so you like things, well, the way you like them. But even when you're smiling through clenched teeth, waiting for everyone else to get with the program, deep down, you're really still smiling. You're just waiting for that impatient moment to pass. When it comes right down to it, you are thoughtful, meticulous, and good at what you do. As for romance, you can be a little picky and want things to be just-so. We wouldn't expect anything less. And like the original Monica, if you can avoid rushing into things, you'll find the right match and all the happiness your sweet, finicky, heart deserves."   urlLink According to 'the coffee test' i'm 'the sweetheart:  "Sweet, smooth, and lighthearted. Is that you or your coffee? To the casual observer, there's really no difference. How you take your coffee provides people with a small window into your personality. Here's what one might see...  Comfort is key. Your coffee says that you don't like anything rough around the edges. If you could coat the world in sugary sweetness, you would. You are kind and have a potentially bubbly personality. Your coffee-style labels you as a fun-loving individual who doesn't get bogged down by overly serious things. You like to make the most of each day, and you take time to enjoy yourself. When it comes to uncomfortable situations, you would rather avoid them than confront them. You most likely surround yourself with friends, and when it comes to life, it's all about having a good time."  I really need to stop taking these tests and start working on shit that  needs  to get done for school...

      beh.  this weekend was ok...     Friday : As you can see from my Friday posts below, I was screwing around here at home forever before I finally got my act together and left for PA.  The drive down took me the full 4 hours because it  poured  (did i spell that right?  rained really hard...) most of the way down, and once i got into mountain country in PA the fog was  awful .  It was really bad on I-81, but once I got off at the Pottsville exit and took route 61 into town it was a billion times worse...  the fog was awful, the rain was awful, and that road normally is no treat because it winds down the mountain...  soyeah, i got to my Aunt Karen's house at about 8:00 and found out that my mom and stepfather hadn't made it there yet.  how freaking annoying is that?  i had told her originally that i was going to be leaving probably around 2 or so which would put me in about 6.  and then she told me to not hurry...  and they showed up at 8:30 because they stopped to go shopping.   shopping .  these people shop more than anyone i know.  i can't believe how much of their lives are devoted to shopping.  soyeah, they shopped and bought two huge mexican type pots and an enormous mirror.  they didn't need these things.  their house is horrendously cluttered already.  but they bought them because they got "good deals" on them.  and the thing is, they were flying home, so i don't know how they figured they were going to get these huge fragile items home.  whatever.  what really annoys me is they could (and do) shop anytime, but I was coming down to visit with them which i never get to do because they live in michigan and they never make the effort to come see me but they felt the need to shop instead of coming right up.  whatever.  anyway.  so we ate dinner and then RJ (my stepfather) left with my Uncle Bobby to go for a beer run (which apparently meant going to a bar and drinking the beer there).  I sat with my mom and Aunt Karen (who is so freaking cool) and talked.  Later RJ and Bobby came home and my cousin Ryan came out of wherever he was hiding (he is the quietest kid ever.  and he just appears and disappears.  he's really cool though and I wish I knew him better...  we used to play all of the time when we were kids and I lived in PA, but when we grew up he no longer spoke...  I think if I lived nearby and saw him more often we'd hang out though.  he's got a job in computers and i think we share a lot of the same interests.  he's got a really cute car too: a black jetta with tan leather seats...  he's had to get a new car twice now 'cause when he lived in Jersey he had two cars stolen.  so he moved to allentown now that he's got this new one, and hopefully it won't get stolen...  Jersey must really suck)...  So RJ pulls out this portable bar with insulated water bottles filled with really good tequilla and triple sec.  and then Bobby starts pouring shots..  so I had 5 shots and then realized that I was drunk, there was no party/music or friends and I wasn't going to get any so I just went to bed.  I kinda think it's a little weird that I was doing shots of tequilla with my mom, RJ and my aunt and uncle...  whatever.     Saturday : we got up early saturday and went to breakfast with my Nana and PopPop.  then mom, RJ, and I went to the mall (surprise).  After we spent a million years there they were finally done shopping (I normally love shopping, but I'm poor and wasn't in the mood to be doing that there.  besides, i can go to a mall anywhere, why should i shop at the little mall there?).  we went to my Nana and PopPop's house and tried to figure out what we were going to do for the rest of the day (always a chore:  I pretty much never care, and my mom always claims she doesn't but she really does and she can never make up her mind so she just whines and then gets upset when we don't do what she wanted to do but wouldn't say and then RJ gets all pissed but basically wants to please her so we end up doing what she wants to do but with a bunch of drama preceding it which could have been avoided).  So we decided that we were going to go see a movie ( My Big Fat Greek Wedding  - it was pretty good, there were some laugh out loud parts and I'll probably end up buying it on DVD).  We were going to try and get my Aunt Karen to come out with us because she was upset because Bobby shot their dog that morning.  Yeah.  Shot their dog.  The dog was his dog, he got it last year, and it was really cute and all.  My Aunt Karen really got attached to Jake, they had this cute little routine where the dog would follow her around and keep her company while she took a bath and eat ice cream with her at night.  but the thing is, Jake would sometimes suddenly turn vicious and bite.  He bit everyone in their family, and he'd snapped at other people.  He snapped at me when I was there in May...  So, the dog probably should have been put down a while ago.  But Saturday morning he bit Bobby on the hand (gave him a puncture wound that spouted blood) and Bobby was hungover and pissed so he took the dog, some garbage bags, and a shot gun out into the woods and shot the dog once in the head.  I really didn't care.  I mean, it was his dog, and the dog needed to be put down.  I probably would've taken it to the vet, but Bobby was pissed and "wanted to get his satisfaction"  I dunno.  i mean, that's what he felt he needed to do, and i'm sure that later on he probably regretted it because he did love that dog.  but the dog's dead and it would've been no matter how they killed it...  anyway...  Karen wouldn't come with us so we went alone and came back to her place later and kept her company.  Bobby was out playing with his band at some club.  I would've liked to go, and had this been a normal day we probably would have, but we had to stay and support Karen.     Sunday  was uneventful.  we got up and had breakfast and my cousin Sherry (who's severely retarded) kept asking where the dog was.  Bobby said that Jake was "away" and that he was sleeping forever.  Karen said "jake's dead.  daddy shot him" as she made a gun to her head.  that was a little uncomfortable...  butyeah, then i had to wait forever to leave because i had to wait for everyone to get their act together and when i announced that i was going to leave (already an hour later than i'd wanted to) all of a sudden we had to take a bunch of pictures.  this really stresses me out.  when i have a plan in my head about how things should go, it really annoys me when they can't go that way.  especially when it has to do with traveling, and my mom and rj cause stress for me in that areana all the time.  UGH!  I'm just glad i wasn't flying, because they always almost make me late (they get me to the airport like 20 minutes before my plane is scheduled to take off) because that's the way they do things and have no respect for others.  yeahso.  then i drove home.  i got starbucks later (i sat alone inside reading for school and you can't believe how starbucks is on a chilly sunday evening...  it's like some sort of singles bar or something...) and then went to my house to hang out with my sister and do laundry.  I'm still the devil at home apparently, whatever.  they'll get over it someday (my parents are pissed that i didn't help them out last weekend.  it's the first time i've ever said 'no' to them i think, and they were highly offended).  soyeah, amy and i hung out and talked...  and went to denny's later 'cause wehad the munchies...

      More butterfly meanings...  BUTTERFLY - Symbol of the cycle of birth, death and eternal life. Its symbolic meaning is taken from the actual life cycle of a butterfly and the freedom of spirit it embodies  Butterfly - symbol of a carefree childhood, as well as the journey of the soul into eternal happiness.   BUTTERFLY:  Reminds Christians of the amazing transformation that takes place through Christ's redemption and regeneration. When "born again," we become "a new creation." (2 Cor. 5:17)  To many pagans, its mythical meaning is linked to the soul (of the deceased) in search of reincarnation. See the new, politically correct meaning at Butterfly 208: "There's a theory that says if a single butterfly flaps its wings in, say, China, the air disturbance may cause a storm in Nunavut, Canada a month later. If that's the case, imagine the power of your own ideas and others to help improve the quality of life in the world's 208 countries! The Butterfly 208 contest is a chance for you to create your own Butterfly effect! 208 = Number of Countries in the World Butterfly + 208 = A totally interconnected world! A world where even small actions can have a big effect."   Butterfly a project or idea will soon come to fruition; the butterfly also symbolizes freedom    urlLink Butterfly etymology : Germans folklore had it that butterflies were really witches in disguise who were out to steal cream...  Butterfly - Social success, romantic success, and/or domestic happiness is forecast by a dream of these gaily colored creatures.    urlLink this page  has a great description of the butterfly as a  urlLink totem/power animal  that i find completely groovy.

      soyeah.  i've decided to try and figure out what butterflies symbolize to people now that i have one tattooed onto my back for the rest of my life.  perhaps i should have done this beforehand.  ah well.  so here's the first thing that i came up with: Symbolic of resurrection and eternal life, the butterfly emerging from its cocoon represents the resurrection of Christ from the tomb. Just as the butterfly comes forth with a new body, those who trust in Christ come forth with new life. The butterfly also represents flight, freedom, and creative thinking. A symbol of spring, the butterfly truly reflects the beauty of nature.  I guess that would be the Christian meaning of the butterfly...

      so the building where i work was robbed last night.  or burglarized.  what's the difference between those two terms?  well, whatever one would encompass breaking and entering and stealing stuff is what happened.  soyeah.  when i pulled into the parking lot i noticed that there was an albany police car sitting there, but i really didn't think anything of it because dr. m. does a lot of things with law enforcement, so i figured there was someone here for files or for an eval or something.  yeah.  so when i went up to the back door (employee's enterance) i noticed that it was open, and so was the back door to the dentist's office that's on the first floor.  i figured that they must be trying to move something, so i just walked in the building, still not suspecting that anything was up.  I noticed that none of the lights were turned on, which mildly annoyed me because I was sure that people were already here, there were cars in the parking lot and doors were open, so it was annoying to me that people were here and nobody bothered to turn on the lights...  yeah.  i only realized something was wrong when i got into the main room and saw that everyone in the building was crowded around the enterance to the dentist's office and the cop was taking some notes and the secretary from the law office in the building was saying, "yeah, they definately knew what they were taking."  So i walked in, walked past everyone, said "hey" to the cop who just said "hey" back and let me walk right through the building.  well, I guess he figured that I must work here...   so when i got upstairs the one psychologist was here already (dr.mcintyre) and he's the one that works with all of the local law enforcement agencies and the state troopers etc, so i think he was kind of excited that we had a burglery.   he followed me into my office telling me what was going on and pointed out that we had no electricity when i tried to turn on the lights in my office.  yeah, he said "we have no phones, no electricity, no heat..."  i thought he was going to tell me that i could just go home, but instead he said "... i hope you brought a book!" and walked downstairs to follow the cop around.  i could hear him downstairs, talking with the cop, theorizing how they got in, what order they did things in...  he came running upstairs to ask me if we had a clock that was plugged in that would have stopped when the power was cut, but i pointed out that that would require an analog clock and we only had digital clocks..   he was all dissappointed.  it was actually kinda cute how excited he was.  he told me that the burglers had gotten into the dentist's office by pushing the air conditioner through the window and then climbing in.  I asked him, "who robs a dentist's office" and he said that they took cash, receipts, and drugs...  so i guess they tried to originally get into the back door by breaking the window and reaching in, but then they realized that it was alarmed (the dentist's office was the only part of the building that wasn't alarmed).  so they cut the power by ripping the electric meter off of the wall (i guess that's how you cut power to a building without electricuting yourself) and they cut all of the phone/cable lines coming into the building.  that was really annoying, because even after we got power yesterday, we had  no roadrunner, so my day was really boring.   after i finished inventory I speant most of the rest of the day pulling files of people who were hired as state troopers.  i had to spend hours up in the attic with no power freezing my ass off pulling files.  i was happy when we got power so i could come back down to my little office and sit in front of my computer, but when i realized there was no roadrunner, i was pissed.  i had to waste the rest of my time (about an hour and a half) just printing envelopes for a mailing.  SUCK.

      so i went to a job fair yesterday.  it was kinda dissappointing.  if i was looking for a highly technical job or a receptionist job or a finaincial job or a job as a nurse i would've been lovin life yesterday.  but since i knew i wasn't looking for one of those jobs but i didn't really know what kinda job i was looking for, there really wasn't that much there for me.  i got a flyer from nemer volkswagon (because the guy wouldn't let me pass him unless i took one...  he did that wave it in front of my face thing.  apparently, it still works.  wave something in front of my face and i'll accept it and say thank you).  i could sell cars for them and get a free jetta to drive around.  the free car would be good, i'm not so sure about the selling cars thing though.  but i do really want a cute navy blue jetta...  :)  Michelle came with me (which was wonderful of her because although she is looking for a job as well, she's looking for a teaching position and there weren't any schools there, but if she hadn't have come with me i wouldn't have gone at all).  we lapped the place a few times before i got the nerve to go up to a booth.  i approached blue shield of northeastern ny first.  they were looking for someone for their communications department.  i spoke with the woman and i think i impressed her with my l33t skillz and i got her name and phone number before i left.  michelle agreed with me that the woman seemed impressed.  the only thing is, the position is posted internally first, and they'll probably fill it with some dumbass that already works there, which would be a shame because i'd rock (the casbah) at that job.  and it would be actual experience for me.  soyeah.  i guess i'll call the woman tomorrow to follow up... anywho.  so then we walked around some more and GHI was looking for a trainer.  even though i had all of the requirements listed for the job, the woman was just not taking me seriously.  she sucked.  i think she looked at me and was like, "too young" and stopped right there.  eww.  that's really annoying.  yeahso...  then i was tired of walking around (yeah, we'd only been ther like a half hour, but it didn't seem worthwhile to stick around any longer) so we left.    we went to the burger king across the street 'cause i hadn't eaten really yet.  there was this new guy working the register, and he was being assisted by the "old guy" (they kept calling eachother new guy and old guy).  the old guy had long braided hair with red beads at the end and gold front teeth.  the young guy had a HUGE diamond (well, i dunno if it was real, but it was real sparkly) earring in his right ear.  so the new guy took my order, and then he looked at me and said "you got pretty eyes."  i was like, 'thanks' and the old guy started saying to the new guy "man, you can't say stuff like that... they got cameras up here" and then the new guy asked me if i minded that he said that and i said no and then they started in with the camera thing again.  soyeah.  and then the old guy said "you do got pretty eyes" to me.  i was flattered, but a bit uncomfortable standing there.  i just wanted unhealthy burger king food...  so michelle and i sat down.  and then the new guy got off work so he started putting his street clothes over his work clothes and new guy and old guy were having a discussion about how unfair it was that they couldn't wear their "bling" at work.  then new guy started applying cologne, and he came over to me and asked if i could do him a favor and smell the bottle.  so i did, and he asked if i liked it and i said yes, and then he said that it was polo sport, and i said "that's nice."  he let Michelle smell it too, and then he went into the bathroom.  later on, he was talking to old guy and old guy was saying that he shouldn't say things to me or something like that because he saw my husband, who plays for the 49ers.  well, he got it right, i do like football players...    so i'm applying to a few other jobs the traditional way (cover letter and resume through the mail) and one of them is for the local NBC affiliate as a broadcast traffic coordinator.   urlLink here  is a link to a job description for the same position at another tv station.  i'm guessing that the job would be pretty similar.  i think that would be hella cool if i got that job.  i could work in tv :)  then later on my dad could help me get a job at the real NBC (it's owned by GE <- dad works there) in NYC and that would be hella cool.  then beck and i could develop our idea for a tv series based on the odd things that happen to us and i'd have an in for pitching it to the execs.  it'll all work out so well...  :)  yeah, i'm dreaming.  i just hope i get that job.  or any job, really.

      So I decided over the weekend that I'm not going to be a teacher anymore.  Well, at least not now.  I don't think that's what I really want to do.  I don't know what I want to do, really.  I guess right now I just want a job that allows me to pay my rent and go out on the weekends.  That's all I really want right now.  Someday I'm sure I'll want more, and that's when I'll think about going back to school or whatever.  But right now, since I'm not sure what I want to do I don't think it's a good idea to continue to go to school (and dig myself further in debt with student loans).  Soyeah.  Gotta finda job.  The tough thing is, I know that career is never really going to be a priority for me.  I just want to work because I need to make money to live on my own and do what I want to do.  So nailing down a specific job to go for is hard because, frankly, I really don't care all that much.  I'm going to a job fair later on today.  Hopefully, I'll get a better idea of what's out there...   I feel bad though.  I'm leaving these doctors that I work for after only a few months.  That's exactly what happened with their last secretary.  She was a civil engineer who was going for her MBA, but decided after a few months that school wasn't for her anymore and she was going to try and find a "real job" using her degree.  And now I'm doing the exact same thing to them.  I suck.

      So Beck sent this to me in a forward and I quite enjoy the sentiment:  Dearest Friend,   When you are sad, I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge against the sorry bitch/bastard who made you sad.   When you are blue, I'll try to dislodge whatever is choking you.   When you smile, I'll know you finally got laid.   When you are scared, I will rag you about it every chance I get.   When you are worried, I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to quit whining.   When you are confused, I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.   When you are sick, stay away from me until you're well again. I don't want whatever you have.   When you fall, I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.   This is my oath, I pledge 'til the end. Why you may ask? Because you're my friend!   Send this poem to ten of your closest friends or else you will have bad luck (and go to hell) and get depressed because you realize you only have 2 friends and one of them is not speaking to you right now  anyway.   P.S. A friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body.

      so beck and i saw the weirdest thing when we were driving on route 9 in clifton park yesterday...  we were stopped at a light and this red convertable went past us in the other lane and in the passenger seat was the scream guy (from the movies) staring at us.  it was very odd.  he was completely turned around in his seat continuing to look at us when they stopped at the light.  The convertable was from Ohio, and the driver was this redheaded guy who kept staring at us as well.  They kept pacing us, and the guy with the scream mask on took his mask off and at the next light that we stopped at they were right next to us, staring in my car.  it was a little uncomfortable...  beck noted that apparently guys in Ohio don't know how to be subtle when trying to get a girl's attention.  it was all very odd...  :)

      so i'm sitting here in my office bored off of my ass and i'm listening to Hair of the Dog.  and of course, my one boss walks in when "I Used to Work in Chicago" was on.  And I didn't want to change it really quick, because that just about screams "i'm listening to slightly inappropriate music!" so I just left it on figuring maybe he wouldn't notice.  but of course he was in here for longer than he usually is, and he heard the last verse "a man and his wife/came in for a WWII german fighting airplane/what kind of plane said I?/Fauhker she said/And Fauhker I did!/And I can never go back anymore..."  I turned bright red, but he wasn't looking at me, so I thought, maybe he didn't notice, or maybe he just won't say anything, but of course luck was not with me.  as he was leaving my office he said, "that's some funky music you've got playing there" and i stammered something like, "yeah, um, it's, ah, Irish drinking music..."  That was just too embarrassing...  how do I always end up in situations like that?  at least i wasn't listening to puddle of mud (she hates me or smack my ass) which are also on this disc...  why couldn't he have walked in when some of Hair of the Dog's more traditional stuff was playing?

She could post her clip of Michael Keaton (yes,  Batman ) on her voicemail at work saying her name...  Who else has that?  I'd link to her.

      so random-guy-hit-on-me week continues...  I met Amy and Carrie for lunch at the Metro 50 diner outside of Crossgates (we'd never been there before, and Carrie wanted to try it out because it's shiny [it's covered in chrome]) and there was a fire truck outside with its ladder extended.  I guess one of the local fire companies was promoting halloween safety or something.  Anyway, so they had some guy walking around in a dalmation suit and he came inside the diner a couple times and was kind of barking which kind of made me want to be hysterical.  So when we left Carrie and Amy's car was right near the truck so we walked in that direction and I was standing there talking to Carrie and looking at the truck.  I got out my cell phone and returned a call to Beck to see what she was up to, and the firemen and the guy in the dog suit were kinda making fun of me because I was on the phone.  The dalmation pulled out a cellphone and pretended to talk on it, and then he came up to me and put his arm around me and continued to pretend to talk on his cellphone...  I wish someone had a camera, it was too funny. So anyways, before I left, I went over to the truck and asked if I could have a hat, and they gave one to me.  So now I'm a "Westmere fire district Junior Cheif" :)  I wanted to climb the ladder, but I didn't ask because I didn't think they'd let me...  That and if I did climb up to the top I'd probably freak out and have to have someone come and help me down...

      so yesterday we (becky, kelly, michelle and I) went to Pizzaria Uno's at Crossgates for lunch.  We ordered 2 pizzas to share: a tomato and cheese and a spinoccoli (spinach and broccoli).  It was too much pizza for us so we had most of the spinoccoli pizza left over.  When the waiter came to drop off the bill and ask us if we wanted to have the pizza boxed, everyone kind of looked at each other to see if some one wanted it...  They all kinda said no, and someone said something about putting it in my car while we shopped and I said, "No thanks, it would smell like ass."  And the waiter kind of got this weird look on his face and took the pizza away.  I said that it would smell like ass because it would.  Anything with broccoli in it, while it may taste good, would smell like ass (and make your car smell like ass) if you left it in your car for hours and I really didn't want to smell it because I was hungover and already not feeling so great.  So we figured out how much we owed, and then suddenly the waiter returned with the manager and she said, "let me see your check" and she took it from beck and said that they were taking the spinoccoli pizza off of the bill because we didn't like it.  We were all shocked, and then we started protesting saying that we did like it, and the waiter looked at me and said, "well, i overheard your comment about how it would smell..." and I almost died.  I said, "anything with broccoli would!" and tried to let them know that we did like the pizza and that it was unnecessary to take it off the bill.  But they weren't hearing it, and the manager said, "yeah, it's always going to smell like that, so just don't order it again" and walked away with the check.  The waiter returned a few minutes later with our new edited bill...  i was so embarrassed, that pizza was like $13 and I never said that I didn't like it, in fact, I didn't even eat any of it!  We left him a big tip...  I can't believe that they insisted on removing it from the bill...   I just can't figure out why he did that...

      So has anyone ever heard the expression, "the whole thing from soup to nuts"?  I was sitting in class Wednesday night, bored out of my mind and staring off into space, when I heard my prof say, "It was the whole thing, from soup to nuts."  I immediately looked up with an odd look on my face.  First of all, I heard "soupy nuts" which is gross, and I almost started laughing right away when I realized that she said "soup to nuts."  Then the girl next to me said, "yeah, I've never heard that expression either, but I think it means when you have dinner you'd start with soup..." and I'm thinking, "and end with nuts?"  The whole thing was just too odd for me, and frankly I guess I'm not that mature, because I couldn't help but want to laugh.  So I had to sit there for ten minutes trying to supress a giggling fit.  I just kept thinking "nuts?"  You end dinner with nuts?  And, you know, in what sense of the word?  God, I'm so immature.  Whatever...  I just couldn't help it.  So later on, during a break, this guy that I'd never talked to before from my class who looks German to me because he looks Aryan (and kind of reminds me of Billy Idol) came up to me and said, "So, what got you laughing so much about 'soup to nuts'?"  I was hella embarrassed...  I'd never talked to this kid before and he comes up to me and asks me about nuts...  I said, "Well, you know...  I'd never heard that expression before, and I was thinking... Uh, you don't want to know what I was thinking..." and he laughed and said that sometimes he starts laughing to himself in class and can't stop either.  I told him that I was so glad that I'm not the only one that it happens to, and that it happens to me all the time and he laughed.  I was just so embarrassed though that someone caught me, and then asked me about it...

      so the people that i interviewed with tuesday called me today while i was at work and asked if i could come in and fill out another form so that they could do a background check on me.  i guess the form that they had me fill out tuesday ended up being the wrong one, so i needed to fill out this one for them.  since they said that they were only going to do a background check on the candidate that they were most interested in, I took this as a good sign.  i must be at least in the running, or else they wouldn't have bothered to have me fill out the correct form.  i told them that i would be able to drop in and fill out the form on my way to st. clare's this afternoon...  so i went home from work today (after stopping at the post office and mailing about 500 letters for work... and the thing is, the window wasn't open, so i had to stuff them in the mail slot about 20 at a time...  i felt like a real tool) and made myself 2 bagel sandwiches with hummas, lettuce, tomato, and alfalfa sprouts...  one to eat then and one to take to work later.  i thouroughly enjoyed my bagel, and then fooled around online until i was running late, at which point i flew out the door, forgetting my lunch.  i only realized that i forgot my lunch when i was almost to the highway, but i still turned around because the sandwhich was just so good and i knew that if i left it out it would be spoiled...  so by the time i really got on my way i was running very late.  i sped over to the insurance company, and met with first just the one lady who interviewed me and then the guy came out "to say hi."  i filled out the form and then after making nice and saying goodbye i was on my way.  a few minutes down the road, i suddenly thought, "i have something in my teeth."  i looked up in the rearview mirror, and sure enough, there was a big 'ol piece of lettuce stuck in my teeth (see diagram below).  one (or both) of them must have given me a weird look when i smiled, because how else would i have suddenly thought a few minutes later to look at my teeth.  how embarassing!  i must have looked like such a freak!  but really, it makes me laugh so hard just thinking about it.  i mean, that was a  big 'ol  piece of lettuce.  how could they not have noticed it?  how could  I  not have noticed it?  they must have been like, "oh, my God, do I say something?  how embarassing!"  it's just too humorous.  i'm standing there all smiley and laughing and i've got a HUGE piece of green lettuce sticking between my two front teeth.  it had such a potential for a snl sketch...  God, that makes me laugh!!  i get slightly hysterical every time i think about it...

      so i just got back from an interview with  urlLink Mercury Insurance .  the interview was for a 'casualty adjuster' position, which i guess is sort of like an investigator...  people would come to me with claims and i'd investigate them and decide how much they'd get from the company.  so basically i'd be a god.  well, not really, but go with me on this, i'm trying to make this job sound really cool in my head...  i'd be a detective-god-like person.  (i didn't mention to the people interviewing me that that's what i thought of the position..  it would probably have sounded crazy).  so it was a great interview.  i was completely relaxed, and even though there were two people there asking me questions i didn't feel overwhelmed.  i don't know if i got the job, but if i did, i'd definately like the people who i'd be working with.  it sounds so weird, but i actually kinda had fun at the interview...   beh.  anyway, if i get the job, rock, if not, oh well.  i just have to find something by january...    so i'm going in to work at the hospital this thursday evening.  yay!  not.  i'm only going into work because then i'd have 'extra' money to go see guns n' roses in november.  that'll completely kick ass.   i hope we go.  becky keeps telling me that we're not partying again till st.patrick's day (she's the unhappy no-party dwarf) but then she mentioned going to see this concert so i'll have to pretend that it won't be partying...   but it totally would be :) shhh...

      so i went to starbucks for some energy and to get away from my computer for a little while so that i could get some actual work done.  since i also had to look for a book for school at barnes and noble i went to the starbucks on wolf road (the one right outside of the barnes and noble as opposed to the one inside there...  weird that there are two so freaking close.  i mean, seriously they're within 100 yards of eachother...)  the barista there freaking kicked ass.  he kicks everyone that works at the clifton park starbuck's asses (except for that one guy with the piercings that usually makes me my caramel macchiato on sunday evenings...  their skillz are about equal).  i can't believe the difference.  i got a subpar caramel macchiato at the clifton park starbucks last night from some random girl.  and the one i got tonight was just about the best ever.  it was thouroughly pleasurable to drink.  anyway.  i just felt like sharing.  apparently who makes your coffee makes a big difference...   still didn't get much done, so i better get back to it...  beh.  i hate school.

Now I'm going to have to call them tomorrow and be like, 'gee, sorry i didn't get that voicemail till 230am sunday morning because my phone SUCKS!  do you still want to interview me?'  suckage.   beh.  must get in the shower now and get ready to go to the state police academy to schedule wannabe state troopers for their psych evals...  i'm running  so  late though...  but that's not really new...

      so yesterday i decided that i was going to bring my cat (Dude) up to the apartment.  (my mom was absolutely thrilled).  so i drug my brother to wal-mart and bought all of the cat necessities (i couldn't take anything from home because my other cat (Tuxedo) is still living there.  i got one of those fancy litter boxes with a hood so i don't have to look at his crap, a cheapass bowl (from the dog section because my cat's such a pig that none of the bowls in the cat section would've been big enough), and of course litter and food.  the thing is, everything i wanted was on the top shelf, pushed towards the back.  so my brother and i had to scale the shelves of wal-mart in order to get the cat crap.  (i told my brother that we were going to wal-mart to buy catshit, and i think he really thought that's what i wanted to buy.  when we got there, i wondered aloud where they kept all of the catshit and some old woman passing by gave me a weird look).   so then last night after we were drinking at fridays (well, i was the DD so i only had one megamargarita while beck had three...) we decided to abduct my cat and bring him to my apartment.  so we snuck into my house at 1am, grabbed Dude and took off.  Beck held Dude in the car for me, and he was shaking pretty much the entire way here.  he seems to like the apartment.  he's already found a couple places to hide where i have no idea where he is.  when we went to bedlast night, he wouldn't get off of me, but now he seems fine.  he's such a lazy, boring cat though.  all he does is sleep on my bed.  it's a comfortable bed though, that's pretty much all i want to do also...

      so today (thur, halloween) i saw an ectomobile.  well, it was like a ghetto ectomobile.  it was this grey-blue colored station wagon with a bluelight on top and the ghostbusters' symbol painted in various places and the lisence plate said "ecto1"  it was pretty random.  it was like someone had a shitty car and an obsession with the movie...   I bought frames and a mirror and they will all eventually be hanging in my living room.  yeah, once i get nails.  how annoying.  i got home, i was all ready to hang my shit up, and i realized that i was out of nails.  i suck.  also, i can't hang things in straight lines.  my picture gallery will be a little fucked up looking.  ah well.    so they called me from mercury insurance, and they want me to come back for a second interview on monday.  i hope i get this job (pretty much because i don't really have the ambition to keep looking).  the job sounds kinda interesting, and it definately sounds like it would be something different every day, and i think i'd really do well in a job like that.  i just get so hyper and bored easily.  whenever i meet the crew for lunch on sundays i always get ancey.  i enjoy the conversation, but i just can't stand sitting for too long.  last sunday somebody suggested that i be checked for ADD.  i dunno.  i  am  pretty hyper lately.  even beck commented on it tonight.  eh.  i've always been kinda hyper.  i don't like to rest or sleep.  i feel like i'm missing out on things or something.  anyway, this job sounds like it would keep me constantly busy with everchanging new problems, and that'll be good for me.  so, yay, got called back, now i hope i get it...    so i went to beck's tonight and on the way home from poughkeepsie i actually saw deer.  i never see them when i'm driving and i kept seeing them all over the place tonight.  i took that as a sign that i was going to hit one and die.  so i tried to slow down, and that worked for a little while... but then...  i just love to drive fast.  there's no way around it.  i'm not happy unless i'm speeding.  it's just so much fun to drive fast.  and i've got this fucked up attitude about getting pulled over.  i see it as a challenge.  i feel like i'll never get a speeding ticket because i haven't gotten one yet.  so i'm really not afraid of getting pulled over, because i'm pretty confident that i'd be able to cry my way out of a ticket.  this is going to be bad someday.  someday i'll actually get pulled over and get a ticket, and boy, will i be pissed.  it'll be some woman cop who gives me one...  please God, don't let me ever get pulled over by a woman-cop.    here's a pic of beck just after she gave candy to trick-or-treaters.  she looks all annoyed because this is not the first picture that i took of her serving candy.  look at what she's giving out.  Almond Joys.  Eww.  Coconut candy!  i would've egged her house...  but I guess she redeems herself with the twizzlers (because they make mouths happy)....

      so i had a pretty decent weekend.  went to the rusty nail (a bar in clifton park which may or may not be named after a pretty nasty sex act) on friday with beck, neary, and steve.  they had  urlLink yuengling  on tap which made me happy.  beck, neary, and steve ate some horrible looking wings which i wouldn't touch because they get your fingers dirty.  well, that's not the only reason.  i just can't ingest something that's brightass orange dripping grease.  eww.  we went back to steve's afterwards where we watched "big rigs" or something like that.  it was this half hour tape on different kinds of trucks that someone had given to steve as a gag gift when he was a trucker, but he apparently really likes it so we had to watch it.  there were many disturbing scenes where a little girl was interviewing lecherous-looking truckers.  fell asleep on the sofa (and kicked steve who had fallen asleep on the other end of the sofa 'in my sleep' until he went upstairs to his own bed.  hey, i figured he had a bed upstairs, he didn't need to be sleeping on the sofa making me uncomfortable).    Saturday was the day of movies with really good looking guys in it.  Beck came over and we ordered Chinese food and ended up watching "The Three Musketeers" on CBS.  Chris O'Donnel is really hot, but he just looks so gay with long hair in that movie...  Then we went to Crossgates (where apparently everyone else in the world went that day) and looked at  urlLink mini cooper  because I've decided that I totally want one in either chili red, indi blue, or british racing green.  it's just such an adorable car, and i've read great reviews on it.  we didn't stay at crossgates long because the crossgates mono kicked in with a vengence.  so we returned to my apartment where we vegged out and watched "Circle of Friends."  Chris O'Donnel is also in that movie, and he is very extremely good looking, something about the eyes, the hair, the rugby shirt (and shorts) and the irish accent really does it for me...  :)  sothen we went to the movies and saw  urlLink the transporter  which i completely enjoyed even though beck and neary pointed out that there wasn't much of a plot.  ok, no, there wasn't, and yeah, the dialog sucked, but the chase scenes and the fighting scenes were just so kickass.  and the main-character-frank-guy was really hot.  and apparently british (he had a great accent).  there was one part that was just vaguely homosexual though, a fight where all the participents were covered in oil and slipping and sliding around, and then frank ends up under water with a dead body of one of the guys he was fighting and he has to suck air out of the guys mouth to survive. butyeah, after the first 10 minutes of the movie (really, the best part) where there's this great chase scene i decided that i'm going to be a transporter.  but first, i'll need a better car...    Sunday i met the gang for lunch at houlihan's (how is it that even with an extra hour of sleep i was still late?  i suck).  then i went to my house where i performed experiments on my little brothers for school (not as weird as it sounds) and actually got some homework done!  it was amazing...  then beck and i went for starbuck's (wouldn't be a sunday without starbuck's) and we drove around.  this time we made our way towards schenectady where we saw a "working structure fire" (<-beck's technical terminology) that was really cool-looking... there were firetrucks all over the place.  we tried to take a picture, but we couldn't get close on the second pass...  we ended up back at my place where we ate ramen, downloaded music and finished watching circle of friends.  we discussed having a "ghetto thanksgiving party" where we'll serve ramen, mac&cheese, popcorn, pretzels, and toast (a la charlie brown) and, of course, canned cranberry sauce still in the shape of a can (actually, that's my favorite, and we have it at my house every thanksgiving)....

I called Mary Ellen at Mercury to give her a start date.  I said Mon, Dec. 9, which is about a week after she was expecting me to start, and she said she'd have to check with Andy (the manager) and get back to me.  i hope that's going to be ok.  now i feel like a tool.  i suck.    so the cable guy still isn't here.  the slot of time is between noon and 4:30, so there's still 2 hours left in the slot, but i didn't get here till 1 because of work, and i'm all paranoid that i missed him.  the woman on the phone yesterday said that if i missed him then to call right away so they could see about getting someone else out here, but how would i know if i missed him?  i mean, since she said that i guess they'd leave something in my mailbox or something like that...  there wasn't anything there when i got home (i don't think...  now i'm going to obsessively check it...  irritating) so i don't think i missed him.  it would suck if i didn't end up getting cable today, 'cause i was all psyched about new south park...  i guess i better finish up my homework for tonight, because after i get cable there will be no homework doing...

      so i actually went to class tonight.  amazing for me.  i took a test (first one done, as always in this class, and it looks like i got the best grade out again.  kinda embarassing).  we (a couple of people from class and i) were going to leave after the test and go to a bar, but one of the girls in the class mentioned that it looked like the prof (who sucks, by the way) had our papers that we handed in last week to give back so we stayed.  it sucked so much.  we watched a stupid video module (all we ever do in that class, that's why i never go) where some kid got all excited over christmas and puked.  it was the most random video.  later on they showed three year old italian kids who kept grabbing at the microphone (microfono!  encore microfono!) and they never made the connection of why they were showing them...  and then the stupid teacher never gave us back our papers, so staying was a big waste of time.  beh.  soyeah then we went to Sadie's (which is just down the block from strose).  i had a couple glasses of guinness (poured expertly by the barkeep with little shamrocks on top) and talked to the guys that came along while the other two girls each had a mixed drink and talked about their boyfriends.  very typical that i ended up talking to the guys more than the girls.  we discussed different shots/drinks that we liked and the weirdest places we'd "done it."  intelligent conversation to say the least.  but a good time was had by all and we made a resolution to do that every monday (which is good, because it'll at least get me to class).    so now i sit here eating leftover mexican food that's been in my car since friday.  that's pretty gross.  but i'm hella hungry.  i didn't have much money with me, so all i could afford was my drinks (but i did steal some broccoli/cheese poppers from the girls that were hella yummy).  soyeah.  the food still tastes ok, and it was so cold this weekend that it was like it was in a fridge anyways...  (i'm going to think this is so gross tomorrow).    the best thing about having a cat around is that he'll eat the shit you drop on the floor, so you don't have to worry about cleaning it up...  so i have to tell my doctors that i'm leaving them.  i feel like such a tool.  i'm not looking forward to this at all.  i have to do it tomorrow.  depending on jeff's schedule, i think i'm going to talk to him just before i leave tomorrow.  that way i won't have to sit there all day feeling like an asshole.  but i'll have four weeks of that to look forward to...  beh.

      okso, the "Work: A" part was true from my weekly horoscope...  i got the job at mercury insurance.  i was a little late to the interview (which annoyed the hell out of me.  but i just couldn't get out of the house) and i met with the regional director (ken?) right away.  he seemed nice..  kept going off on tangents about his kids and the local schools and the weather...  but nice all the same.  he asked me a few questions, but nothing really in depth, and then i asked him some things (what's the most important quality in order to succeed in this position?  how am i evaluated?  what are the opportunities for advancement?) and then he went and got Mary Ellen (who will be my supervisor).  I could tell from the way he was talking to me that I pretty much had the job.  then Andy (the branch manager) came out and we talked for a few minutes (he was on his way out to pick up a police report) and I got the impression that I was going to be working there from the casual manner in which we were talking, and then Mary Ellen came out and offered me the job...  it pays decently (actually, it pays just what i was realisitically looking for) and i get full  urlLink benefits (including discounted car insurance) .  I'm pretty excited.  and to celebrate, i'm calling up timewarner and getting cable (all i have now is roadrunner).  hopefully, they'll be able to get here by wednesday at ten, so i won't miss the new episodes of south park...  :)

      So here's my weekly horoscope:  CANCER Your creativity is heightened at the beginning of the week. In fact, if you are in the arts, Monday and most of Tuesday are as inspirational as they come. Look to get some long-avoided work done the rest of the week.  Your luck this week*  Love: C Money: C Work: A  ok, well, i like that "Work: A," because I'm going in for my second interview today with  urlLink mercury insurance  and it'd be sweet if they offered me the job.  i'd get cable right away then (hopefully by wednesday night because the new South Parks start then...).  My parents seem to think that they're going to offer me the job because they say that they don't bring you in for a second interview unless they intend on giving you the job.  well, that'd be nice, but all of the career-advice-sites that I've gone to don't really say that.  I'm nervous because I'm thinking that they can't decide between me and some other candidate, and I really want to make a good impression today.  But, I feel like we covered pretty much everything in the first interview, so i have no idea what we'll discuss today.  and i asked all of my questions the first time, i really don't know what to ask today, and every career-advice-site that i've gone to says that you should definately make a good impression by having questions prepared.  beh.  well, at least both of my doctors are out of the office today, so i can research some questions to ask, and also what to wear.  i've already worn my interview outfit, now i've got nothing to wear today.  it's a "work casual" environment, but i feel like if i just go in pants and a work-shirt i'll look too casual for an interview (even though it would be totally appropriate to wear to work there).  suck.  i hate this process, they better give me this job, 'cause i'm too lazy to do this again.

       on why i hate the college of saint rose   basically, it's because they steal your money.   they suck so much.  they charge like a billion dollars tuition a semester and they give you a crapass education.  and they're supposedly the best school in the area for teaching.  three out of four of my teachers "teach" straight from the book.   my wednesday night teacher is the worst.  you can bring your book to class and highlight the exact passages from the book that she's speaking.  word for word.  and she had the nerve last week to say that she doesn't subscribe to the theory of direct teaching.  um.  yeah, right.  all she ever does is stand up there and speak her outlines which she takes right from the book.  oh, and sometimes she divulges unnecessary personal information.  like the one time she said that she wasn't feeling too well because she ate some food that didn't agree with her or something like that.  and then suddenly during class she says something like "here comes the food" and ran out of the room.  eww.  like we all needed to know that's why she was leaving.  she could have just said, let's take a 10 minute break or something.  whatever.  my monday night teacher also sucks.  he's a full-time clinical psychologist with a private practice and he's got a bunch of other shit that he does, so i don't know why he teaches also.  probably for the health insurance so that he doesn't have pay for it on his own.  anyway.  he also teaches directly from the book.  he even uses the provided powerpoint slides that are basically the textbook only on a screen.  and his tests are right from the teacher edition of the book, so sometimes they're the exact same questions that are on the practice tests on the website.  every time i take a test in that class i'm finished first and since we have to grade our tests right away and everyone goes outside and compares their scores i know that i generally get the best grade in the class.  and it's not like i study.  in fact, i put the least amount of effort in possible.  we just got papers back in that class last night.  he was saying that you should have at least six sources blah blah blah and that it should be all scholarly blahblah.  and i'm sitting there thinking, "great.  failed this because i had three sources and two were textbooks and i did the whole paper in 3 hours."  we got them back and i had a 91 on it.  a 91.  and other people got grades in like the 80s.  and seriously, i never go to this class and i generally leave early when i do go and when i leave early i just walk right out in front of the teacher.  we'll be on a break and i'll go back into class and collect all of my things and he'll watch me leave.  why do i get these grades?  i certainly don't deserve them.  and that's not the only class it happens in.  actually, it's been happening in all of my classes.  but perhaps the worst example is the paper i got back today in my philosophy class.   all of my papers that i've handed in for my philosophy class have been shitty, half-assed jobs done an hour before class.  but the one i handed in last week was really the shittiest ever.  i didn't even read the book.  i kind of skimmed through the introduction and wrote the paper.  i got it back today and i got an A on it.  rediculous.  i mean, it's my highest grade so far in that class (i'd gotten Bs and B+s before).  and he wrote on the top: "Very good analysis of Newman and good comparisons."  and he wrote comments throughout the paper, so he did read it.  i must have some grade angel that redoes all of my work for me, because there's just no way that the work that i've been doing is deserving of the grades that i've been getting.  no way.   and this is why i hate saint rose.  because they're ripping students off.  they take their money and then let them get away with doing shitty work and rewarding them for it.  i feel all dirty now.

      Sunday Beck and I went for a walk.  It was so warm out, it would have been a crime to not go for a walk.  We walked down Riverview Road for a while when a small beagle crossed the road in front of us.  We half-tried to stop it as it escaped from its yard, but we weren't sure whose dog it was, and we weren't sure that we cared.  Then some girl holding a toddler came from the yard where the dog was fleeing calling after it.  It was clear that the girl was not going to get this dog holding the small child, so I offered to go after Daisy who was at that moment running free through the yard of a house under construction in a gated community across the street.  It was such a nice day, and I was in a good mood, so running across this yard in pursuit of a puppy was fun.  I felt like I was six years old...  carefree, running and laughing...  Then the damn dog went towards a mud patch.  I recognized this too late...  I ran into the mud and when my sneakers (of course i was wearing my "good" sneakers) started to sink i tried to turn around...  and i slipped and flipped down into the mud.  The whole back of my sweatshirt was covered in mud, and so were the bottoms of my jeans.  My hat even got dirty.  I had to laugh though.  I wish somebody had taped me falling, it must've been hilarious.  I got back up and crossed a ditch on a plank of wood left there and went after the dog another way...  eventually, I got bored and ceased to care about whether or not this snotty looking teenager and her little sister got their dog back, so beck and i just left as the girl wondered around the yard trying to get the dog and keep a hold of her sister at the same time.    being covered in mud is very freeing.  i felt like i could do just about anything then, because i was already dirty, so what did it matter?  I guess that's what it's like for a lot of things.  like: i've already spent this much, what does it matter if i spend more?  or: I've already gone this far, I might as well go further.  in fact, that's how i came up with my concept of owning something.  you've already done something that you didn't think you'd do or aren't very proud of, but instead of whining about it, you've got to own it.  and once you own something, it's easier to own other things.  soyeah.  i owned that mud.

      soyeah.  last thursday i baked a cake.  see, one day last week i was trying to look up the nutritional information for  urlLink guinness , because i'd been drinking a bunch lately and i was thinking that it was counterproductive to my efforts to not gain weight and so i thought i'd try and figure out the 'points' value (weight watchers) of a pint o' urlLink guinness .  but when i typed in "guinness nutritional information" in  urlLink google  all i got were a bunch of recipes for things with  urlLink  guinness in them.  and one of them was a recipe for  urlLink guinness chocolate cake  and i figured that since i hadn't baked in a while and since it was cold out i'd try and make it.  soyeah.  thursday i gathered my materials: i had to purchase a hand mixer (got the el cheapo version at  urlLink target ), mixing bowls (got a cute but cheap cobalt blue set at  urlLink target ), cake pans (got the hella-el-cheapo version at  urlLink the christmas tree shop : $1 each), and a cake holder (also cheap at  urlLink the christmas tree shop ...  $2 and it's cute).  I also went to  urlLink the grocery store  and picked up the necessary food supplies for baking (flour, vanilla extract, sugar, etc).  unfortunately, i forgot to get eggs, so i ended up having to walk to the stewart's down the street after dark to get them.  it wasn't late yet, still in the 6 o'clock hour, but i don't think i'll do that again...  it was a little nerve wracking anytime anyone walked by me, and i was the only female out walking alone.  soyeah, after i risked life and limb for eggs i got home and started to bake.  well, first i had to do dishes...  i had a ton of dirty ones in the sink, and i had to clean all of the crap i had just bought.  in the meantime, i put two sticks of butter (one for the cake, one for the icing) on top of my computer to soften (hey, it's warm there...).  i made the cake batter, and it seemed a little thick, but i figured, hey, maybe that's how it's supposed to be, and i stuck the layers in the oven.  then i started on the icing.  i went to grab the stick of butter off of the computer and i realized that there were still two sticks there.  i had freaking made the cake without putting the butter in it.  i was  so  pissed.  i was really curious how this cake was going to taste, and i'd fucked up the recipe.  so i just made another batch of batter.  when the layers were finished in the oven, i popped them out of the pans, cleaned the pans and threw the better batter in and stuck 'em right back in the oven.  the layers that i'd screwed up don't taste bad, they're just darker and denser (i call them my  urlLink guinness  stout cakes).  i didn't have enough icing to cover two cakes, so the stout cakes are sitting on top of my microwave covered in foil.  i don't know why i kept them, i should just pitch them.  yeahso, when the layers were cool (enough) i stacked 'em with icing in between and covered the cake.  i wasn't too careful so there were crumbs all mixed in with the icing.  also, i didn't bother leveling off the layers when i stacked them, so the cake was all lopsided.  whatever.  here's a picture of it:      I didn't sample it until the next day because by the time i was done i was a little drunk (i had to finish off the cans of  urlLink guinness  that i'd opened to make the layers/icing...  and i'd also had some more...) and a lot tired.  it was really rich, and i liked it (except next time i won't dust the pans with cocoa powder like it said to, because the straight cocoa that you taste between the layers is bitter).  I took it to my parents house on friday, but i don't think they liked it very much because it was still there today (but dad said that he just forgot it was there).  i brought a piece for beck to try tonight when we met for coffee, and she said it tasted "yeasty" and "like bread," which i don't think are good reviews.  beh.  ah well, i liked it... and baking is fun :)  speaking of going to get coffee, beck, her brother, and i tried to go to  urlLink Starbucks  urlLink   because that's what we do every Sunday night, but it was closed.  how freaking annoying is that?  it was only 7:30 when we got there...  they had a sign on the door that said that they had some sort of district meeting or something like that, and that every starbucks in the area was closing at 5.  that's so annoying.  i mean, does  everybody  have to go to this meeting?  they need  all  of the peons there?  we had to go to  urlLink dunkin' donuts  instead.  i got what i always get when i go there: a large iced coffee light and sweet, and the woman really went to town.  i mean, there was a good 1/4 inch of sugar at the bottom of the cup.  but hey, i like it when i drink my coffee through a straw and i get to chew on the sugar granuales (sp?  ah well).

      so this guy called here (at work) earlier.  he's a nys trooper candidate and he's having an issue.  (one of my doctors is the one that coordinates all of the psych evals for trooper candidates etc).  this guy could barely spit it out though.  his issue was that the place where he was trying to get records released from lost his release form.  he needed the fax number here.  he also needed another copy of the release form.  unfortunately, what he said (the first time he called) was "beh blah bep biddle boo" or some other nonsense.  he said things out of order and stuttered his way through his problem.  but he didn't tell me the whole thing.  just that the place lost his forms and that he needed our fax number.  not that he needed more forms.  and then when he ended the conversation he couldn't figure out what to say.  finally he just said "thank you."  then an hour later he called back with the same issue.  this time he was trying to say that he needed the forms.  so he's going to show up here in a few minutes.  this'll be interesting.  i'm going to need to have him fill out a few lines on a couple forms, and i'm sure this'll confuse him.  God, what if this guy becomes a trooper?  Could you imagine getting pulled over by an idiot like that?  he'd come up to your window and stumble around trying to ask for your license/registration...  people would just drive away on him.

      I'm so bored.  I want to die.  I got here this morning and I thought maybe it'd be a busy day.  The people who were scheduled for testing were already waiting downstairs, so I knew I'd have to get their test forms setup right away and get them started.  And there seemed to be a ton of stuff in my "to do by the end of the day" box from Jeff.  But after I got the people started on their test and got into my box, I realized that there wasn't much there.  All of the work that was left for me took a grand total of 20 minutes.  Now I'm left to sit here alone for the rest of the day.  Both Jeff and Bill are out of the office.  This is a good thing usually.  I can usually run around and play my music and goof off and dance (I know, I'm weird) but since there are people in the waiting room taking tests all I can do is sit here in my tiny closetoffice and putz around on the computer.  Hopefully they'll leave soon.  soyeah.  bored.  slightly sleepy.  starving.  am going to make great cookies after work today to take along to beck's house.  she's making dinner again: homemade mac & cheese.  mmm...  i wish i had homemade mac&cheese right now.  this room is so cold. there's no heater in here.  suck.  what an awful, boring, rambling post.  better just stop now.

      so after weeks of dragging our feet, we finally have tickets to see guns and roses.  they will be playing at the pepsi arena a week from today.  i'm hella excited.  and it was just so lucky that i looked yesterday to see if there were still tickets available, because i randomly stumbled across a two for one deal.  how awesome is that?  so not only do we get to go, but it will cost half of what we would have paid.  rock.  soyeah.  beck, alex, one of his friends named dave (who beck calls homiedave) and i will be going next week.  yay!  i've bugged beck so much about it that i can't talk about it anymore though.  but i'm really excited.  i even had a dream about it last night.  i'm like at that point where i alternate between, yay! it's only a week away and, ohmygod i can't believe it's a whole week away!  so what rocks is, it's the day before thanksgiving, so no worrying about work the next day.  rock.

      beh.  been a while.  haven't felt like doing much this week though.  haven't done any homework, but seeing how i'm no longer interested in teaching, i've already got a job lined up and i hate my school and don't have to do shit to do well in it anyway (see post below) i don't think that matters too much.  i can't really get myself motivated to do the homework at all, and i really don't want to go anymore.  maybe i won't.  i don't know.  i know that i should go...  finish out the semester...  i've already paid for the credits, i should "earn" them.  butyeah.  complete lack of motivation may prevent that.   so winter weather sucks.  could stop any time now.   saw the new Harry Potter movie yesterday.  it was pretty great except for the 15 minute long lovefest that seemed to drag on forever at the end of the movie.  butyeah other than that, rock.   bed now i guess.  i meant to write a good long post, but can't even get motivated to do that.  suck.

      So GNR was awesome :)    We got to the concert by 8:00, and  urlLink CKY  was just finishing up their set.  I only heard 2 of their songs, and I couldn't tell you which ones, but they were pretty good.  Then the lights came on and they set the stage up for the next warmup act,  urlLink mixmaster mike .  what an odd act to have at a GNR show.  They played this like 5 minute video before he started that was like an infomercial for Mixmaster Mike...  it was like they had to play something to let us know who he was so we could get excited about it...  He was a DJ who was apparently really good at doing his DJ-spinny-scratchy thing.  He played a lot of songs that white people would know (because that was the makeup of the entire crowd) but it kept getting annoying because of course he wouldn't just let a song play the whole way through, and some of the songs were pretty good...  every time he played a song that beck, alex, or i knew, he changed it like right away or right before it got to the really good part.  The guy was pretty good, but it was just the wrong venue.  The arena wasn't crowded enough for everyone to be dancing and partying to his music...  if he were in a club or at a party, he'd rule.  but in an arena, it kinda sucked.    Soyeah.  When Mixmaster Mike was done, the lights came on again (this was about 9:30) while they set up for GNR.  Then they announced, "come on ladies, get them out, you know what we want" and started focusing the camera on some of the girls in the audience.  if a girl flashed the camera, she got cheered.  if not, she got booed.  this was kind of entertaining for about 15 minutes, but then they couldn't get any more new girls to flash the camera, so they kept going back to the same girls over and over. it was odd.  a girl would realize that she was on camera, and then just either (1) wip up her shirt and stand there proudly as she jiggled her boobs around with her tongue out, (2) smile and wave and laugh hysterically with her friends, but not flash the camera, or (3) look really hella pissed off and give the camera the finger (after which she'd get booed).  Beck said that if they put that camera on her, she'd definately give it the finger.  I decided that I wouldn't flash it, but I probably wouldn't give it the finger either.  soyeah.  unfortunately this girl flashes camera thing went on for like 45 minutes and got pretty boring.    around 1030 beck's phone rang and it was some people that she knew from work who were also at the concert and who'd come over to see her earlier.  they said that they heard that GNR wasn't there and so they were leaving and getting a full refund of their tickets.  So beck told us that and I was like, that sounds like a rumor, and we sat there for another minute and all of a sudden GNR came on.  Alex and I told beck that she had to call her work friends back and tell them, and she did, but they were like, yeah, oh well.  Beck said later that that guy kind of has a defeatest attitude all the time.  i'd be hella pissed if i left and then found out they were there..  ah well.  anyway.   the show was great.  they played like every old song that i wanted to hear, and they only played a few new songs (which were pretty good).  there were some awesome pyrotechnics: flames shooting up from the stage and sparks...  During November Rain, at the end when it starts up again, sparks showered down like a sheet of rain...  it was awesome :)  And during the encore, when they played Paradise City, there were these huge pinwheels of sparks in the background, and they shot tons of confetti into the crowd.  Axl sounded great, and the new band sounded pretty much just like the old band.  The new band was huge: 3 or 4 guitarists (can't remember now), 2 keyboardists, a drummer, and Axl.  We were very happy that this new band didn't try and change any of the old songs, they played them just the way you wanted to hear them without really adding any of their own flavor to it or otherwise making it their own.  Soyeah, it rocked.  Very cool show.  the only really odd thing about the night was some of the people around us.  There were two guys both wearing jeans, fleece sweatshirts, and shaved heads sitting in front of Beck and Alex who sat pretty much perfectly still the entire show and looked straight ahead.  Even during GNR!  I mean, why did they come to the show?  were they enjoying it at all?  freaking weird.  they looked like cult members or something the way they were sitting there, looking alike, and looking like they weren't even hearing the music.  The couple in front of me smoked pot the entire time.  Every time I looked down at them they were either lighting up another joint or making out.  When GNR started they both got up and were dancing around at their seats (i think they were even dancing when there was no music).  The guy kept yelling annoying things like, "Freebird!" or "Skynard!" which made me want to punch him.  His voice was really annoying too, he sounded like a 12-year-old boy.  On my left, at the end of our row sat 2 angry-looking-dyke-women.  they got hella annoyed every time we had to get by them.  i apologized to them every time i went by them, and one of them kept smiling at me, and i think that's because when i went by them i'd face them and i was wearing a very low cut shirt (hey, i figured if i had to keep making them get up, i'd give 'em something to look at).  anyway.  to beck's right sat a couple on the end of the row who kind of looked pissed off the entire time, and two older (30sish) guys who just sat the entire concert not really getting into the music either.  who are these people that go to concerts to just sit still and look like they're not having fun?  anyway.  yeah.  I had a good time :)  So, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!  I'm heading up to my parents house today, and I think I'm going to spend the entire day with the family for a change.  When I was little, I always had to go to my mom's in the afternoon, and when I was older I had to go to Tim's house to eat with his family.  So today's like the first Thanksgiving (other then the time we were in Disney World for Thanksgiving- which rocked) that I'll be able to spend the entire day with my family.  We're going to eat earlyish and then go to see Harry Potter, and then come back and eat some more :)  I'm in charge of making the rolls this year (I'm kind of a guest now, so I figured that I should bring something) because mom always burns them every year.  So here's hoping I don't burn the rolls, 'cause I completely made fun of her every year that she did.  Soyeah, now I've got to go to the store and pick up roll mix (because I'm a dumbass and didn't do it before) and the store's going to be hella hella crowded, so this should be fun...  then it's home to watch the parade, make rolls and head down to the fam.  Soyeah, I hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving!

      Yay!  Today is  urlLink guns 'n roses  day!  I've been so excited about going to this concert for months!  Yay!  i've been checking out the setlists at some  urlLink unofficial site  and it looks like they'll start with Welcome to the Jungle and that they'll most likely play pretty much all of my favorites.  yes! yes! excellent! (said with clenched teeth while pumping arm).  butyeah.  cool.  :)  soyeah.  plan for the day: sit here at work, bored off my ass until around noon, when i'll go run some errands for jeff.  i have to drop a letter and some books off at a judge's chamber at albany family court.  i know i'll probably only see a secretary, but how do you address a judge?  i mean, what if he's just there and i have to hand it over to him.  do i call him Your Honor?  i guess so...  couldn't hurt.  yeah.  so i figure that since i'll be downtown anyway i'll swing by the  urlLink pepsi arena  and see if i can pick up the tickets at the will call window then.  i don't know how early you can pick them up, but it'd be nice if i could get them early instead of having to go later and wait in line for them.  yeah.  then hopefully my sister will be able to meet me and go to the mall with me to exchange my blue bra for a black one (important mission).  then i'll probably go home and clean up a little (cat litter.  ew.) and forage around for some food (really, I actually don't know if i have anything in my house to eat.) and then call beck incessently asking when we're going.  then concert.  yay!    Oh!  So, I'm trying to work a new word into my vocabulary: grim.  See, I've always been unhappy with the amount of times I say "suck" because it's just so unoriginal.  I'm always like, oh, that sucks.  blah.  so last night Dodi and I were watching that 70s show and on one of the repeat ones Donna uses that word.  It's after her first day of Catholic school and she's sitting there in her uniform talking to her friends in the basement and Eric asks her how her first day of school was and she says: "Grim.  A nun spanked me with a ruler."  I was quite impressed with the usage of the word grim.  So Dodi and I decided that we'd totally have to start using that word.  soyeah.  i'm tired, and that's grim.  (see how easy it is?  you try it)

      today in a nutshell:  230am:  receive call from keith.  who calls at this hour?  don't pick it up because of the ungodly hour.  he must have been drunk.  left a message saying that he "wanted to see how [my] night went" and that he'd call me later in the week.  weird.   9am - 915am:  do some actual work at my job at the doctor's office   915am - 1pm:  sit around bored off my ass at my job at the doctor's office.  listen to the movie  harry potter and the sorcerer's stone  playing on the laptop that some smart parent brought along for their kids to watch in the waiting room.  hum the theme song and wish that i could just join the children in the waiting room because i'm not doing any work anyway.  play on the internet.  make copious copies because the copy machine is in the waiting room and at least then i can slyly watch the movie.  finally go home.   1pm - 130pm:  have lunch (marinated portabella mushroom cap on salad) and make plans to walk with michelle.  decide to take a nap.   130pm - 205pm:  nap.  wonderful.  sleep later than planned though.   205pm - 225pm:  try and get myself out of the house but end up writing an email to  urlLink Dodi  and then putzing around until i realize that I'm to meet michelle in five minutes.  225pm - 240pm:  fly down northway to meet michelle.  am a horrible friend because i'm always late.   240pm - 330pm:  walk with michelle.  we go the less muddy way, but it ends up being shorter than the usual route.  decide to go to starbucks.   330pm - 440 pm:  travel to and arrive at starbucks.  have a tall caramel machiatto.  is not as carmally as expected.  call home to find out what's for dinner and "make reservations"   440pm - 640pm:  have dinner with the fam.  cheesy corn chowder (very good).  listen to little brothers play on the piano, watch them play video games, promise to watch star wars episode II in its entirety with the littlest guy on thanksgiving day.  "help" dad play you don't know jack on the computer.   640pm - 9pm:   go to  urlLink target  with dodi.  return to her place and watch 3 episodes of that 70s show.  love the hyde/jackie storyline because can't help but think hyde's cute.  am annoyed that eric proposed to donna because they're only in high school and will end up divorced.   9pm - 930pm:  travel home.  call my sister a few times to bug her.  decide to exchange blue bra bought the other day for a black one.  listen to guns 'n roses.  get excited that will see them tomorrow, and then sad that there's no one to call and share my excitement with because beck was not at home.   930pm - 10pm:  check email and update blog.  decide to read and go to bed early.  tomorrow will be a long day.  also decide that this is a boring post and that i should apologize to everyone who wasted their time reading it.  sorry.

      so the general consensus seems to have been for me to call him (my mom even emailed me and said that my dad said i should call him...  i guess they do read my page).  soyeah.  i did call him today.  he seemed pretty receptive to talking to me.  I think he wanted to do something tonight, but Dodi's boyfriend broke up with her and I wanted to take her out so that she wouldn't be sitting home and sad.  I said that we might go up to Saratoga and he said that if we went up there I should call him and he'd come meet us out.  Then he asked what I was doing this weekend and I said that I'd probably be going up to the parting glass friday night because hair of the dog is playing.  so he said he'd look for me.  yeah.  we talked for a little while (but it was a little hard to understand him because he'd just woken up from a nap and he was mumbling with the accent and all).  then beck arrived so i said i had to run.  so beck and i took dodi out.  we ended up just pretty much going to friday's.  then we drove around looking for somewhere else to go, but it was monday night and pretty much everything was dead.  soyeah.  this week will be cool.  tomorrow: well, pretty much nothing.  decent tv though (that 70s show).  wednesday: guns 'n roses concert (awesome) thursday: thanksgiving (yumm).  friday: parting glass, hair of the dog (awesome).  saturday: ghettocharliebrownthanksgiving party at my house (menu: toast, popcorn, ramen, other ghettopoorkidfoods).  Soyeah.  cool.

      so i've been sitting here thinking about whether or not i should call keith (see post below) today as he asked me to (he said, "call me on sunday, even if you have to work") and now i have to share my horoscope and i'm going to need some feedback here, so if anyone reads the page today or tomorrow (cause i'm thinking i might wait until tomorrow to call) they have an obligation to leave a comment or else all of those bad things that chain emails say will happen to you if you don't send them on will happen to you.  here's my "extended horoscope" from  urlLink ivillage.com :   Quiet, giving Cancers get another splashy day or in the sun, and you could really use it! Find the time to relax and take care of yourself. Later in the day, love makes you wild and selfish, and everyone stands up and applauds the change. You deserve any good thing that you can create for yourself. Tonight, don't rely on other people to make plans. Take the initiative and revel in the glow of being in command. No one says no to your confident demeanor.  seenow, i'm thinking that the take the initiative part means i should call.  Then i read my "singles love" horoscope (also at  urlLink ivillage ):  You'll get what you want. The stars give you the wink. All the elements for a hot romantic time are firmly in place. You feel strong but tender, alive and immortal in this fleeting moment. Speak now or spend your life wishing you had.  seenow, the "speak now" part seems to be pretty much just putting it out there: i should call him.  i dunno though.  oknow, comment away please.

      so friday night i was supposed to go out with dodi and one of her friends in albany.  now, i live in albany, but i really don't enjoy going out here.  there are a few bars i don't mind, but i'm just not into clubs all that much.  dancing really doesn't thrill me and there are always a bunch of college kids running around...  but i figured that going out is going out and it's better than staying in so i wasn't going to complain.  when dodi got a hold of me later though, she said that since the weather was so bad (it was raining and supposed to turn to snow) she didn't feel like going out and would rather just stay in and watch a movie and get drunk.  I was a little disappointed, but i figured that doing that was better than nothing, so i headed up to clifton park.  i figured that maybe i could convince dodi to go to  urlLink the parting glass  because it's my favorite bar and it's up in Saratoga (i just love it up there) and i'd been in the mood to go up there all week.   so i got to Dodi's house and we sat around for a while and her cousin Chris called and said that he was on his way over and then I proposed going up to the Parting Glass.  Dodi was receptive to the idea (it seems that there was more than just the weather that prevented her from wanting to go to Albany) and when her cousin arrived we headed on up.   when we arrived the front of the pub seemed pretty busy, so we decided to go back to the dart room where there was another bar.  we passed through the performance area where a rather shitty band was playing (the "adirondak rednecks") and went into the dart room...  which was almost completely empty.  There were two younger guys playing darts and one guy sitting at the bar talking to the bartender and a waiter.  the three of us sat down at the bar and decided that it seemed weird to sit in here when it was nearly empty, so we'd order our drinks and then go into the pub part of the bar.  but then Dodi and I got a look at the bartender who was incredibly good looking, spoke with an irish accent, and was spinning bottles in a "Cocktail" way at the other end of the bar and decided that a hot bartender was enough incentive to stay in that room.   we ordered our drinks (a  urlLink guinness  for me, a  urlLink captain and coke  for Dodi and a  urlLink for Chris ) and we started talking and covertly staring at the bartender.  There was a glass full of stirrers in front of me, so I showed Dodi and Chris the trick you do with them that's supposed to tell you if you're going to get laid that night.  You take the stirer in one hand between your thumb and your middle finger and you try and bend it directly in half just using those two fingers.  if you get it directly in half that means your getting laid that night.  well, they were not sucessful at first and so we kept trying it and before long there was a pile of creased red stirrers in front of us.  The bartender (whose name was Keith) came over and asked us what we were doing.  Dodi explained the game and he tried it - and got it right in half the first time.  we said he had to do it again, so he did - and got it right in half again.  he got it like six times in a row.  the waiter that he'd been talking to earlier, Law, came over and asked what we were doing.  then he showed us a trick where you have a glass, a cherry, and an upside down brandy glass and you have to get the cherry inside the glass using the brandy glass but not turning it rightside up at all.  we couldn't figure out how to do it, and when he showed us how, we were all very impressed (i'm not going to tell how to do it, because it's a neat trick and you'd want to be surprised when you're shown how).  we then sat there with Keith and Law and did a bunch of bartricks (can't really remember most of them anymore).   Dodi had her phone out and she was playing with it, then she put in on the bar.  Keith picked it up and started playing with it and Dodi said, you can put your number in if you want to.  he did, then he looked at me and asked me for my phone.  He put his number in mine as well and handed it back to me.  Chris said that it probably wasn't his number, that he probably put different numbers in our phones.  Dodi and I then compared numbers and concluded that it's probably his real number because he put the same number in both.   it was very dead in the bar, and Keith showed us how he could flip "bar mats" (which is what he called coasters) and bottles.  then he said that when he was bored he made up shots.  he started preparing a shot that used a lot of green alcohol, some coconut-tasting alcohol, some milk, and some pineapple juice.  then he put out four glasses and poured us each some of his shot, which he called a "little green monster."  he did the shot with us (which was very good) and let us have it on the house.   then it was last call, and he asked if i wanted another guinness (i'd just finished my third...  or was it fourth?) and i said no, that's ok, but then Chris said, "no, she wants another one" and I said, "I do, I just don't want to pay for it" and Keith said, "I've got it" and poured me another one.  The bar started to clear out, and Keith and Law finished closing up and came to the other side of the bar to sit with us and have a drink and tell jokes (most of which i can't remember.  i was pretty drunk by then.  Keith told one about a "little green man" which involved him saying "little green" in his irish accent about a million times and I can't remember at all what the punchline was, but I really enjoyed listening to him speak).  Keith sat next to me and before I knew it he had his hand on my leg.  i responded in kind, and when Dodi and Chris said that they were hungry and wanted to go to Denny's he came with us.  it's ridiculous how not perceptive i am about this type of thing.  i never know when a guy is interested until it's extremely obvious.  i had no idea most of the night and when i told Dodi this the next day she said that it had been obvious.   anyway.  i won't go into detail because i think my parents look at my page every once in a while but i had a  very  good night with the hot irish bartender.  he told me that he has every sunday and monday off and that i should call him.  he told me a bunch of times that i should call him, but i'm not sure that i will.  i mean, i don't really know if he meant it (but he did ask me to an awful lot, and i do have his number) and, what would i say?  hi keith, it's ali, the girl from friday night...  hmm.  i dunno.  and he's divorced with two boys under the age of five.  but he is really hot.  and the accent just kills me.  and we did have a  really  good time...  we'll see...

I love my little funky ghettocharliebrown christmas tree!

I think I've outgrown my love for  urlLink Saturns  because now they kind of look like toys to me.  But that Tiburon just kicks my ass.  So that's what I want next...  'course, I'll probably have to buy a used one, but that's ok...  yeah.  I wish I didn't like that car so much.  Now when I look at mine I get all irritated...

      so, i can't believe  urlLink this show.   It's called the  urlLink Sunday Night Sex Show .  It's hosted by some Canadian grandma named Sue Johanson who answers questions from callers about anything related to sex.  And it's just so odd to watch.  People call in asking about...  everything, and little grandma there just talks away.  She's got a red and a blue model (like the ones artists use to draw people) behind her that she uses to demonstrate different positions, and she's got a "pleasure chest" that she pulls out and reviews different sex toys.  And when she's explaining things to people, she likes to use a lot of hand motions.  It's just so disturbing.  She often tells people to go down to their local sex shop to purchase different items.  Like for the one caller that Sue told the woman to go down to her local sex shop and buy a small butt plug called the "wild thing."  Disturbing.  She knew a specific name for one.  Canadians are kind of weird.  They talk about sex etc and then end the call with, "Ok, thanks, good enough!" like they were just buying tires or something.  One guy called in, and he was just a complete asshole.  He said that he and his girlfriend had anal sex two days ago and that since then she'd been bleeding.  He didn't seem to be concerened that she'd been bleeding for two days, he just wanted to know when they were going to be able to do it again.  Sue told him that he needed to take his girlfriend to the "emerge" (which is apparently what they call the ER in Canada).  What an ass though.  I think Sue should have told him to put his girlfriend on the phone so that she could tell her to dump his ass and go to the emerge herself.  Anyway.  I just couldn't believe this show existed.  Beck told me about it before, but I wasn't quite prepared to watch this sweet little old lady demonstrate how to use sex toys, etc.  The show is like a car wreck: horrifyingly fascinating.

      so i went to my office's christmas party tonight.  kinda felt weird going having only been working there for four days.  but oh well. dinner wasn't served until after 8, which was a little irritating.  i had the pasta mediteranian, which was pretty good (although it doesn't touch the amaretto penne from carmine's) and i was happy with my choice because the chicken dish looked bland and the prime rib just looked huge and scary.  yeah.  so.  they gave everybody a $15 gift card to best buy, and then at the end of the night they drew names from a hat to give away $10 in movie cash.  I was one of the winners (rock).  so i came out $25 ahead for the night.  i'm glad i went.  even though i was the  only  person who came alone.  but oh well.  i'm single and fabulous and if anyone has an issue they can eat it.    yeah.  so i'm hella tired now.  I'm such an old woman.  I'm gonna go to bed...  tomorrow is casual day because it's friday and we get to wear jeans to work, which really excites me.  wee!  it doesn't take much...

      so the job seems to be going well.  I handled my first claims yesterday.  I'm not sure I knew exactly what I was doing, I had to ask my supervisor for a lot of help (which annoyed me because I hate asking for help...  but oh well).  I hope they don't "set me free" too soon.  Ugh.  I had to call some people...  I've only been doing the first part where you gather the preliminary information and enter it into the system.  I haven't done any sort of investigation at all yet.  I hope that instead of just giving me some more really easy claims (like cracked windshields) again today they'll do some actual training with me.  I guess they said that they ordered training books for me, but they haven't come in yet.  great.  anyway...  I can't believe how tired an 8 hour day makes me...  I was so used to working those nice, short 4 hour shifts at the doctors office...  dammit, the real world sucks.   beh.

      so the first day of work was pretty much how I expected it to be.  The horoscope below rang pretty true it was just a passing moment.  Everything seemed a little overwhelming and confusing, but I didn't let it bother me too much because I figured that it'll just all come in time.  It seems like a job that you really have to just learn by doing.  Soyeah.  Everyone seemed nice... I got there at the same time as the branch manager (Andy) and so he let me in and showed me my cube.  I've got a new computer that's really cute... it's black and silver (only a 17 inch monitor though)...  a compaq with a 1.7 ghz processor (soyeah, it's 3 times faster than my little computer here at home...).  It's the newest computer in the office and the only sleek black and silver one and I'm just so happy to not have a beige box like everyone else.  soyeah. tomorrow promises to be pretty much the same as today, but they mentioned something about me making some phone calls to insured/claiments which i'm not too excited about doing already...  I really don't know the policy any better than they do just yet, so I'm not going to be any good at fielding questions...  yeah...  anyway...  we'll see....  I've been invited to the company christmas party at the century house on thursday night.  i told them i was going, then had to tell them that no, i wouldn't be bringing a date.  single is fabulous, but i'm going to need to line up some guy friend that i can get to go to functions with me in a pinch...  so i can't believe how tired I am...  i did aerobics today after i pigged out and felt hella guilty..  no more pigging out.  more aerobics...    so i found this awesome framed four leaf clover at  urlLink redenvelope.com .   I'm just fascinated with it.  I think I need it.  If I had $28 to spend on myself I'd have it right now (or as soon as it could get shipped...).  But I don't have $28 to spend on myself.  I don't even have $8 to spend on myself.  I'm ass,  ass  poor.  Can't wait till I get paid, but most likely that won't be until the end of this month (30th) because I just don't think payroll will be able to get everything ready in time for me to get paid the 15th...  suckage.  I'm so poor.

      so tomorrow's my first day at  urlLink mercury .  I'm a bit nervous.  Well, I'm not sure how nervous I really am.  I don't feel like I'm going to throw up every time I think about it, and I don't think I'll have much trouble getting to bed.  But I keep saying that I'm nervous.  I think I'll really be nervous the most when I get there tomorrow.  I'm not sure where to go.  It's a very small office (so they tell me anyway, I've never gotten a tour or anything), but I don't know the code to get past the reception area.  I hope my supervisor will be there to meet me.  Or at least I hope the receptionist is there when I get there to tell me where to go.  Ick.  That's the only part that I anticipate sucking.  Yeahso.  I'll most likely just do the first day stuff tomorrow: filling out paperwork, getting the tour, etc.  They know that I have absolutely no experience in the field whatsoever, so I don't think they'll be expecting much.  I'm excited for my own desk :)  Yeah...  I better get to bed.  Frankly, the thing that makes me the most nervous right now is if I'll get up on time tomorrow and if I've got it figured out right timewise (how long it'll take me to get ready, get out the door, and get there).  beh.  so wish me luck!   I just checked out my horoscope for tomorrow at  urlLink ivillage  and this really seems to apply for a first day at a new job...  weird... :   Different ideas may confuse you initially, but once you take the time to hear them out, they may grow on you, Cancer. You don't have to be totally right, just don't be too wrong. This is a place-holding day, a passing moment on your way to greater, more noteworthy things. Go through the motions and blend into the woodwork. You may be able to rely on your friends and coworkers to get you through the rough spots. Know when to ask for help and when to work it out on your own.    I'll take that to mean that it'll be like pretty much every first day at a new job: not too great, but not awful either.  I like the "This is a place-holding day" line...  that seems like it'll ring pretty true...  Yeahso... sleep now for good day tomorrow.

      Friday was my last day of work at  urlLink the doctors office .  I was very sad to leave, because Jeff and Bill were the best bosses ever.  They took me out to  urlLink Carmine's  which was  excellent .  I had the Amaretto Penne, which consisted of grilled chicken, shrimp, and penne in an amaretto cream sauce that was sweet and excellent.  I really enjoyed every bite.  At the end of the meal they presented me with a thank you card (with a humorous note) and a $50 gift certificate to Crossgates with instructions to buy more shoes.  I gladly followed those instructions later in the day when Michelle and I went to the mall.  We hunted all over the mall for a pair of tall brown boots that didn't look cowgirlish and that had a notsohigh heel because I'm tall enough already, thank you.  We were about to leave when I decided to try and look in  urlLink Lord and Taylor  even though I rarely shop in there.  We went in, and I immediately found boots I loved.  They were exactly what I was looking for (well, except that the heel is pretty tall, but dammit, I guess I'll just have to own it that I'm taller than the general population) and they were on sale for $55.  The saleslady was very weird.  She seemed like a character straight out of  urlLink SNL .  She talked very oddly, kind of slow and very dorkish (I think she snorted when she laughed) and she could only handle one thing at a time.  And she kept making mistakes and she was extremely slow.  But, when I went up to pay for the boots and I showed her a tiny scuff near the bottom of the boot (which, honestly, you'll never see, and it's not like I'm not going to scuff them up) she took 10% off of the boots which meant that after I applied my gift certificate from the doctors I only had to pay $1.47.  I was very excited about my $1.47 boots and I got to wear them out Friday night (see post below for details of Friday night activities).  I'm thankful that Michelle came along, because she told me to show the saleslady the scuff and that I'd probably get $ off of the boots.  Yay!  Anyway.  Still excited about the boots.  In fact, as I recall, they were in my dream last night (which was an odd one... something about dimensional traveling using a remote control...  i dunno), I think I was wearing them with a skirt (a plaid wool skirt, now that I think about it.  Dammit.  I wish I really did have that skirt from my dream.  It ruled).

      so Friday night I went to  urlLink McGeary's  with  urlLink Dodi , her friend Dallas, Eric, and Ryan.   urlLink Hair of the Dog  was playing, and I was very excited to go.  I decided to handle my extremely tight financial situation in this manner: I'd pre-party at my place with the alcohol I already have here, pay the $5 cover to get in, and hope that if I needed a drink, someone would buy one for me.  It worked out well: Dodi bought me my first Guinness, Eric bought me another one later, and Dodi and Dallas each contributed some of theirs to fill my glass (plastic cup) again later on.  Actually, I was pretty ok (read: hella drunk) after the first Guinness because the prepartying at my house consisted of two (double) shots of tequilla, but the drinks kept getting handed to me, so what was a girl to do?    Anyway.  The crowd that night wasn't that big and most of them didn't seem to be familiar with HOTD, so that was annoying.  As a result, they played mostly songs that everyone would know (Brown-Eyed Girl, Out My Back Door, Mrs. Robinson, etc) and didn't play a lot of traditional Irish music.  And their songs that you're supposed to interact with (Tim Finnigan's Wake) didn't really go over well because the only people who knew them and knew what to do were like me and I think five other people.  In fact, during Tim Finnigan's Wake, when everyone was supposed to yell "Lunch!" only a few of us yelled and the singer actually said, "That sucked."  At the end of their set, I was a little afraid that everyone wouldn't cheer enough to get them to play their encore.  But they did.  They played the shortest version of I Used to Work in Chicago that I've ever heard, which was a little disappointing because that song's great.  But then they ended with The Parting Glass, which they hadn't been doing at the last few shows I've attended, so I was happy to hear it :)  There was some sort of Christmas party there before HOTD started their set, and the women who were attending were very drunk and dancing during the show.  This provided a sort of horrific entertainment because they were all pretty much not attractive and they were bad dancers.  There was this one woman who wore a white fleece hat, scarf, and gloves the whole time.  It was so freaking hot in there, I just wanted to go over and rip them off of her.  We speculated on them being lesbians because of the glaring lack of males, and Eric said later that he saw really ugly woman kiss hat and gloves on the hand (through the gloves.  odd).  anyway, so it was a good night.  I had fun, enjoyed the band, and spent very little money.

      so i had to make cookies last night to bring into work today.  i made peanut blossoms (those rocking little peanut butter cookies with hershey kisses in the middle) and they turned out awesome!!  They're so good.  I rule.  I used the hershey kisses with the almonds in them.  I hope there are some left at the end of the day so i can take some hom, but i kinda doubt there will be (dammit).  anyway, so yeah, i'm an oustanding baker :)  (and i'm really modest).  soyeah.  then when i got in here our computer system kept going down.  so i got to waste an hour and a half chatting while we waited for it to get fixed.  rock :)  yeah...  and now it's up and i'm still wasting time...  i just have so little actual work that i really have to stretch it out to look busy...  beh.  i hope the day goes quickly...    i'm going to see Lord of the Rings tonight with Beck and Alex.  I told Beck to tell her brother to come early, and I hope he does, because I don't want to wait in line alone.  It's kinda a dorky movie to see, and i don't want to be standing there alone...  also, if i get seats alone, i don't know how i'd be able to save the seats and at the same time somehow get their tickets to them...  so far it doesn't look like the shows are selling out, but i guess it's still too early to tell.  maybe the 630 show that we're going to won't sell out because it's so early...  anyway, i can't wait!  :)

      so yesterday i went Christmas shopping and I've got pretty much everyone done.  I still have to buy something for my dad and my stepfather though.  men are hard to buy for.  I may have a few ideas though...    I used my $15 dollar gift certificate to  urlLink Best Buy  that I got at the office Christmas party to get a little pair of speakers that I can plug into my MiniDisc player (well, I used $11 dollars of it) so I can listen to my music at work.  Rock.  I'm so happy that I can sit here and listen to good music.  I've got  urlLink HOTD  playing now (but that's not a surprise to anyone, is it?).  They rock.    I'm so bored at work today.  Everyone in my department is apparently really swamped, but I've got nothing to do.  This is because I'm the new girl and they're only throwing the simple claims at me right now.  And, since they have no time to teach me what I need to know to start handling the more difficult claims, I'm not sure when this boredom will end...  My supervisor is going to be out next Thurs and Fri, and I'm thinking those are going to be really boring days for me.  I'm probably just going to sit here.  Ugh.  But, I know that this lack of crap to do isn't going to last very long, and I'm going to be overwhelmed soon, so I guess I should just enjoy it while it lasts.    So I don't understand why some of my people aren't returning my calls.  Hey, I'm just trying to pay them some money here so that they can get their cars fixed.  I mean, if someone was calling me leaving messages saying that they're trying to send me a check, I'd call 'em back and at least leave a voicemail...    speaking of, my voicemail is just so gay.  i did it kind of in a hurry one day and i think i just sound so stupid on it.  but i'm too lazy to change it.  i like mess up a few words and just sound generally retarded..  ah well...  so some guy that i was taking a first report of a claim from earlier said, "can i have a hug?" when I asked him if there was anything else I could do for him.  weirdo.  I've talked to a few weirdos already, and I've only been here like 2 weeks.  I talked to one guy last week who kept calling me babe, and then when i asked him to do something, he said "yes dear."  i was all skeeved out.  I mean, ew, I didn't even know this guy.  and then when I told him of a $200 deductable on his policy that he was apparently unaware of he said, "my agent's a tool."  i didn't know how to respond to that.  i was like, "um, yeah...  ok, well is there anything else i can do for you today?" and he said "no thank you dear" (ew) and i told him to have a nice day and hung up.  of course he was from downstate.  from the island.  all the wierdos and rude people are from the island.    beh.  bored.  i took an online typing test at  urlLink typingtest.com  and my best time so far is 68 wpm with 98% accuracy.  rock.  I'm going to try some more and up my score...  wow, i'm hella bored.  but at least all of management just went out to lunch so i can sit here and do nothing and goof off and not feel so bad...

      i got a treat today at work!  a vendor sent insulated lunch bags with a pen (a nice one with a cushy grip) a notepad (sticky notes) and a bag of lindt dark chocolates inside for everyone in the claims department.  yay!  very exciting.  Right around Christmas time is a great time to start a new job!  :)

      so i haven't finished my shopping or sent a single Christmas card and the big day's only a week away.  I suck.  I'm going shopping tonight, and hopefully I'll get a lot done.  Beh.  I wonder if it's just too late to send out cards.  If I get them tonight...  beh.  not worth it.  I'll have no time to write them out...  they won't get written out till like saturday or something and then won't go in the mail till monday...  i dunno.  perhaps i'll still do them..    so i'm at work and my bosses are all in a meeting and i've really got no work to do right now, so i'll just sit here and goof off and post to the blog.  i'm wrestling with a decision: my mom and stepfather are going to be in pottsville with the family from the Christmas eve until that friday (the 28th).  i don't have any time off, 'cause i just started this job (I work a half day Christmas eve, and then have Christmas day off of course, but i have to be back at work that thursday and friday).  anyway.  so i wouldn't be able to travel down to pottsville until that saturday morning, and then i'd have to leave early afternoon sunday to get back here and get rested for work monday.  mom said that she might be able to change her plans and stay that weekend.  but i'm not sure...  it's just a lot of travelling to do in one weekend.  it takes 5.5 hours to get down there.  i'd love to see my family (and especially my mom) for Christmas, but i don't have  any  money this month and all that travelling...  ugh.  but i'll feel like a giant turd if i don't go see my mom around Christmas.  ugh.  holidays suck.

      so i can't believe how tired working makes me.  i suck.  8 hour days completely wipe me out.  as i'm typing this, all i can think is "oh my god it's 1030, i should really go to bed" and i'm actually tired...  wow.  i'm such an old woman.    so i went to the advent penance service today.  my soul is now free and clear of sin.  so if i die now, it'll be in a state of grace.  but really, that's probably not going to last too long.  if i wasn't such a wimp and didn't want to have to sit there and list to the priest my sins in the little confessional room i'd go to confession once a week.  but i mean, come on.  at my church he sits there and sees you before/after you confess but during it he sits behind a screen.  he knows who he's talking to.  i can't imagine sitting there and being like, "bless me father, for i have sinned..." and then telling him everything i've done.  of course, what that really means is that i should abstain from my evil ways, then i wouldn't have to worry about it.  but...  yeah, Father addressed the sin of sloth at the service.  Sloth is when you know that you're doing something bad, but you don't change your ways.  So that's what I am.   A sloth.    beh.  own it.

      oh. my. god.  i'm so bored.  i want to die.  ok, it's not busy at all.  apparently all of our insureds didn't go out at all in the snowstorm and therefore didn't get into accidents and so no one's calling in new claims.  i'm just so bored.  i keep staring at the clock.  i can't believe it's only a little after 11.  5.5 hrs to go.  kill me.    i got my benefit package today.  it was nice of them to finally send it.  now it says that i'm supposed to have turned it in 15 days prior to jan 1st or else i have to wait until november to enroll and won't be covered until next jan.  yeah, that's not happening.  i'm totally going to have to call someone out in CA and see what's up with that.  Also, since this is a CA based company, my health insurance company is Blue Shield of California, and so all of my doctors are counted as out of area providers.  suckage.  i've heard some of my coworkers complaining about getting extra bills that they didn't expect for routine labwork.  suck.  whatever.  i just better not get sick.  (says the girl with the nasty chest cold)  ok, i'd like to point out that i still have 5.5 hours left here.  oh. my. god.    i got to hang out with eric and his girlfriend sarah last night.  that was a nice surprise.  well, actually, he did tell me sunday that he'd be up this week but i completely forgot.  you know, being an airhead sometimes has it's advantages if you like surprises....    so i'm trying to look busy, but there's nothing for me to do.  bleh.    i'm cooking dinner for beck tonight.  she often makes me dinner so i'm returning the favor.  so if you want a good laugh, you can tune into my webcam around 630 tonight and watch me cook.  i may switch to a live stream (ooh, exciting!)  so here's the menu for tonight: chicken continental (chicken, cream of mushroom soup, mushrooms, white rice, and broccoli with parmasean cheese on top), a salad (if i remember to go to the store at some point today), and guinness (choice of draught or extra stout).  oh, and for desert, guinness turds.  yum.

      so i got up at the asscrack of dawn this morning and had to help dig out of the driveway.  the snow was about 2 feet deep on the driveway, and at the end the passing plows had built a wall of snow 5 feet high.  that was a lot of fun to work on clearing at 630 in the morning.  they ended up delaying opening the office until 10am anyway, but i was already up and didn't get anymore sleep.    so work wasn't too bad today.  actually pretty boring.  i got my shit done early and now i've got nothing to do but watch the clock for the next 15 minutes.  i can't decide whether to go back to my apartment tonight or to just head back up to clifton park.  i'm thinking parking in albany might still suckass, so maybe i'll go back home.  i dunno.  i think the real reason i want to go back home is that i want to play more ps2.  that's what i did instead of sleep this morning.  i played ssx.  yeah...  i think i just may go back up to the park and play some ps2.  my apartment just seems so boring in comparison...    so i'm packing my bags for the misty mountains.

      so i was just playing ssx with my brother.  i'm actually decent at that game.  yeah.  but i was playing with Elise, and i was reading her stats and it said she was supposed to be 5'11" at 120 lbs.  okyeah.  whatever.  she could totally not be that weight.  especially not with the lara croft rack they have on her.  whatever.  and if she was that weight, she certainly wouldn't be able to snowboard..  anyway.  i guess i shouldn't think too much about it.  it's just a game...    i hate that i have to work in the morning.  i was at starbucks with beck and alex yesterday, and i said how i hate that i had to work on thursday.  then alex said that he had to work wednesday night.  and i told him that wasn't so bad.  yeah, i guess that's worse.  especially since it's snowing like a bitch here.  it's going to suck getting out of here in the morning.  and i'm stuck here at my parents' again tonight.  which kind of sucks. i like seeing and being with everyone and all, but it's too much.  i have nowhere to go.  no privacy.  and everyone here is sick.  this is kind of stressfull for me.  i enjoy afternoon visits much more.  beh.

      so the feeding frenzy is over (has been for like an hour and a half).  everyone is now happily playing with their new toys :)  I got a new TV.  This one is 20", silver, with speakers on the sides.  It's very cute.  And now I won't have to watch TV on a little, ghetto 13" TV.  And it's hella cute and silver so it'll match my stereo and DVD player.  :)  Also, my parents told me that they'll fix the muffler on my car for me.  Which rocks, because it definately needs to be fixed, but I really didn't want to spend the money to fix it...  My little brother (David) got a new computer, which is very cool for him because he's still been using my first computer (a pentium 133).  so he's pretty happy :)  The boys got a PS2 which of course they're playing now.  They got the new Bond game and they're downstairs blowing each other up.  I would like to play it eventually, but I don't think I'll get the chance today...

      so, what am I, like,five years old or something?  It's freaking 630 on Christmas morning and I'm awake...  I think it's actually because I went to bed around the time that I normally would before going to work and so I just woke up at my usual time.  oh, and also, i'm at my parents house and i'm sleeping in the basement and it's  freezing  down there.  and i'm sleeping on a pullout bed.  so it's really not the most comfortable i've ever been.  butyeah.    so the living room looks all serene right now...  the tree's twinkling and there are gifts of all sizes covering the floor.  It really looks like a pretty christmas picture.  i took a picture of it, because in a few hours it won't look like that anymore... there'll be chunks of wrapping paper spewed all over the room, toys underfoot, and boxes and other assorted packaging materials as far as the eye can see.  that room won't be the same again for months.    so when i got here yesterday half of the household was sick.  my dad was sitting in the big chair in the living room coverd with blankets and he could barely talk (which is so odd.  he's such a big, tough guy that when he's really sick like that it's kind of scary).  my second youngest brother, greg, was disgustingly pale with dark circles under his eyes, half sitting/half sleeping on the sofa in the basement next to a bucket, and my sister was walking around with a hoodie on and the hood up looking like death.  mom informed me that they had a nasty stomach bug.  i was completely grossed out.  i wanted one of those isolation masks that look like duckbills from the hospital.  i haven't been feeling too great (my throat had been hurting so bad i thought i had strep) so i really didn't want anything else.  but i'm not sick this morning, I made it through the night here without contracting their disease.  unfortunately my disease has progressed and now i'm coughing like i have pneumonia again.  that'd suck.    so we exchanged family gifts yesterday.  one of our family traditions has always been to exchange our gifts to eachother on christmas eve and then open the gifts from 'santa' the next day.  my little brothers get the cutest things for people.  alex (the youngest) got amy a set of tiny purses because she could use them "to put all her dimes in."  so adorable.  the little guys gave me jewlery: alex gave me a santa pin and greg gave me a butterfly necklace.  I got goonies and the secret of nimh from david and amy.  we watched the secret of nimh last night.  i love that movie.  the music from it is awesome...  and everytime i get sick, i always want that soup that comes in a packet that you add hot water to because it reminds me of the stuff that Mrs. Brisby got to give to Timmy.    ugh.  i was going to try and go back to sleep but my little alex just wandered downstairs and now i have to keep him entertained until a decent hour when we can wake up the parents and the amy and the david (becuase now they're old farts and don't get up early - not even on christmas morning) and open presents.

      soyeah.  i've been thinking.  i get to look at police reports at my job and they are kinda exciting for me, and that girlcop in saratoga ruled last night, and since i don't know what i want to be (except for whatever it is it should be something abnormal because i'm just not normal) maybe i'll be a cop.  and this "decision" is helped along by the fact that everyone i test it out on laughs at me (yeah, really no better way to get me to do something than by telling me that i can't do it).  also, the whole uniform thing really works well for guys.  while walking around the mall yesterday, i saw many young men in uniform, and i've got to say, even if they're not that great looking to begin with, put a uniform on a guy and girls take notice.  but does it work the same way for women?    the ladycop (i bet female police officers would hate that term) last night was awesome: young and cute and confident/take charge but not in a way that she was all powertrippy.  but she's like the first ladycop ever that i've seen that fits this description (other than Ursula from Supertroopers, but she's not real).  so the question that i pose now to you readers (and which you must answer via the commenting system after this post or else face certain death...  and i can track this, i have your ip's) is: do uniforms work the same for girls as they do for guys?  and are ladycops cool/sexy or intimidating/scary or other?  opinions please...

      so saturday night sucked and here's why:  beck and i didn't get to meet the people we were supposed to and ended up just sitting the two of us at the  urlLink parting glass  where the hot irish bartender (keith) obviously ignored me because either (1) i was supposed to call him that sunday night long ago and he thought that i blew him off and was annoyed that i was at his bar because he thought i was a bitch or (2) he was supposed to call me that sunday night long ago and he blew me off and was annoyed that i was at his bar because he either thought i was there to see him and wanted to make it obvious he didn't want to see me or because he thought i wouldn't go back there anymore.  irritating any way.  i hope that he doesn't think that i blew him off (which i'm thinking might be the case) because i totally thought he was going to call me and when he didn't call i figured he wasn't interested although that really probably doesn't make sense since he was the one that pursued the idea of seeing each other again but really he could have called me since he said "call me sunday, or i'll call you."  whatever.  anyway, i just hate that someone would think that i'm a bitch when i really don't mean to be one.  but as beck pointed out, he's a bartender in saratoga with two kids who works every night, would i really want to pursue a relationship with him?  and i guess the answer is no.  but, he was really hot and the accent killed me, and he did seem nice so i'd hate for him to think that i'm a bitch who blows people off.    anyway.  so after we left the parting glass (and on the way out a waitress was hanging on keith and giving me a dirty look - whatever...  i'm not a bitch!  i'm really a  nice  well-meaning girl!) we left saratoga but on the way out got into an accident.  i was driving down broadway slowing down for a stoplight and some guy in an audi was pulling out of a spot on the side of the road and just pulled out right in front of me and i hit him.  then the jerkoff got out of his car and was like, my bumper's hanging off and i was like, yeah, that's cause you pulled out in front of me.  what a jerk.  so then he wanted to exchange insurance info but didn't want to file a police report which pissed me off because i could tell that he wanted to make it into my fault.  so a cop happened to drive by and she said that if the accident was under $1000 worth of damage you don't have to report it.  which i knew, but i also knew that this guy knew it was his fault but was trying to twist it into it somehow being mine.  he kept saying "new york's a no-fault state" and when i explained to him that that pertains to injuries he didn't believe me (even after i told him that i work for an insurance company as a claims adjuster).  he was such an ass.  so then he said to the cop, "blah blah blah new york's a no-fault state" and she explained to him that in this case it was his fault because he pulled out into traffic and that shut him up.  anyway.  i just can't believe that two weeks into my job as a claims adjuster for an auto insurance company that i got into a car accident.  yeah.  so there was no real damage to my car so i'm not putting in a claim.  just some more scratches (dammit!) and my hub cap is all black from his tires.  what a jerk.  he kept treating me like i couldn't possibly have any idea what i was talking about.  it rocked when that cop totally backed me up.  she ruled.    soyeah.  then to top it all off i got home hella early for a saturday night (midnight) and then saturday night live was a repeat (that i'd actually seen even).  butyeah.  i told beck that since last weekend sucked and this weekend sucked (well, 'cept for seeing LOTR - which  ruled  by the way) if next weekend sucks as well, i'm just giving up.

      so last night on the way home from work i had to stop and get oil for my car.  (this is my car's curse: now that it's old it somehow leaks oil when i drive but not when it's parked...  i dunno).  so i pull into mobil and run in and grab a bottle of 5w-30 (the proper grade for cold weather for my car...  i checked) and a funnell and i go out and pry open the hood of my car (yeah, it was frozen shut, that sucked) and i screw off the oil cap and i try and open the bottle of oil.  but i couldn't do it.  i just didn't have the arm strength or whatever to unscrew the cap of the bottle.  so i look around and i go up to the nearest person pumping gas to ask him if he'll help me out.  So he takes the bottle and says, "whatchya got here, oil?  5w-30...  is that the grade you want?" and i'm like, yeah, then he unscrews it and asks me if i know where it goes, and i'm like yeah, dude, thanks.  (well, actually, i was really super polite to him and gave him my best politelittlegirl "thank you sir" and went back to my car).  Ok, I did have to ask the guy for help, but what about me screams that I'm an idiot?  I mean, the only reason why i needed help was becase i didn't have the physical strength to unscrew the cap.  that doesn't mean that i'm stupid as well.  "oh, gee, sir...  could you please show me where the oil goes?  i was going to put it in the gas tank..."  whatever.

      so i think today's going to be a long day...    i don't have much work to do this morning, so i'll probaby be really bored and feel every minute that passes.  blech.  already i feel like i've been here for hours and it's only been one.  suck.    the weather's going to be really sucky today.  i hate winter.  especially in albany.  you know, you'd think that people who live in the northeast would get a clue and just follow the parking rules for during/after snow storms.  but people are tools and they park wherever they want and it just creates so many problems.  the dumbasses on my street park on both sides, and there are at least 3 cars out there that have broken mirrors.  dumbasses.    anywayso.  i hate snow.  i'm bored at work.  i want to go home and play  urlLink Kingdom Hearts .  awesome game.

      so i forgot to mention the most "exciting" part of new year's...  while we were standing at the bar some annoying kid walks up and gets between us to order a drink.  but first he says something on how he thinks the bartenders are gay or something (i really don't know where he was going with that).  he yells at the grumpy bartender to get his attention and says he wants another coors light (or whatever crappy beer he had in his hand).  the grumpy bartender asked the kid why he was yelling at him, and the kid said that he was just trying to get his attention.  then the kid says that he wants another beer again and the bartender says, "you've got one in your hand, who's this one for?" and the kid looks at becky and leans towards her and says "it's for my lady friend here" and the bartender says "she's got one" and the kid said something else and the bartender suddenly grabs his beer and rips it from him and yells "that's it!  you're done drinking here" and throws him out of the bar and calls the cops.  It was hella, hella scary because the kid was right between beck and me and we thought that the grumpy bartender then thought the kid was with us.  in fact, later on he asked beck if we knew that kid and beck said "no, sir."  (please don't throw us out of the bar!).  yeah, so it was scary.  I've never seen anyone get thrown out of a bar before...

      soyesterday beck bought a new phone.  It's a  urlLink Motorola T720  and it's very cute.  So now we both have small cute color phones...    our next step is matching  urlLink smalldogs .  (chihuahua, small dog)  we both like pugs (Frank from MIB) and dachshounds.  i think i'm going to move when my lease is up because although i love my apartment, i hate being stuck down in albany and it's so inconvenient to get to the highways (i've been spoiled living in clifton park).  anywayso, when i move, i'm going to look for an apartment that allows smalldogs.  and then i'll get a  urlLink pug .

      so i had a decent new year's.  Beck and I went to the Macaroni Grill.  We've decided that it might become our tradition, because we went last year (although last year we had timtheass with us).  So our tradition will be this: go to the Macaroni Grill without calling ahead and take a chance with the pager...  decide that an hour and 45 minutes is too long to wait, and scout out the tables at the bar area.  Grab one of those as soon as they become available and happily eat our food while everyone else still waits for a table "inside."    soyeah.  Beck forgot to bring her ID home with her and so we weren't sure how we were going to get her served.  She called home, but there wasn't even a paper license to be found.  So while she sat in the waiting area, I went up to the bar and ordered us both drinks.  Luckily, they didn't give me issue.  So when we got our bonus table in the bar area later, the waitress just brought beck another one when she was out.  I drank Bellinis, because they're a specialty drink there and they're good (champagne and white wine and peach...) but it's been a while since I drank a mixed drink, and the two of them along with a lot of italian food got me pretty ill feeling by the end of dinner...  I should've just stuck with the guinness...    After dinner we decided to head up to the parting glass.  since beck didn't have her ID, we weren't going to be able to get into any of the clubs in Albany, and we figured that since I knew a bartender at the parting glass we could get served there.  So we got up there and it was packed.  I don't know who was playing, but they were pretty good, they played a bunch of elvis type songs.  we went immediately to the dart room, and luckily the old guy bartender ( who's  whose name is Matt, and he's pretty grumpy all the time) ignored us as usual and so Keith got us our Guinness.  It was really smokey in there, and so Beck and I both started to feel ill.  We stood at the bar and consumed our drinks and watched the fools to our left keep trying to trick everybody into thinking it was new years (they kept shouting a countdown...  they did fool some people on the other side of the room once).  one of the guys in this group had a bottle of champagne that he'd started to uncorck, but didn't finish and he kept shoving it down his pants.  how odd.  beck and i decided that it would be hilarious if it went off in his pants.   it didn't though.  there were these annoying guys who came up to us and told us that most girls don't drink Guinness, they don't have the stomach for it, and it requires special breeding.  Beck said, "yeah, well, we're irish" and then we ignored him.  He and his dork friend stood behind us and talked loudly about everything they knew about Guinness and said that their New York accents didn't work for them here and that they were going to go back to Texas and shoot guns naked or something like that.  We really attract weirdos sometimes...    Anyway, so we hung around till midnight and pretty much left right after that.  There were fireworks outside, and when we walked out of the parting glass we had the perfect vantage point.  The fireworks were pretty (but not as good as the ones that we saw at halfmoon day a few months back), but it was cold outside and i was so happy to be heading back to the car right after they were done.  We just went straight home then.  Not a very exciting or eventful new year's, but not terrible.  Neither of us were really up to partying because of our colds, and there wasn't anyone around to party with anyways...

       after the parting glass   well.  we were very drunk.    i've got all sorts of UDBs (Unidentified Drinking Bruises -  Beck's  Tara Anne Pleat's term): there's a bump on the back of my head, two bruises on my shoulders (one on the top of each shoulder), and one on my right knee.  What really kind of concerns me is my shoulders: what could I have possibly done that gave me a nasty bruise on the top of each shoulder?    but it was a good night altogether.  :)

       saturday at the parting glass   so we were back at the parting glass saturday night.  we arrived early, around 9 and got a dart board in the dartroom that was close to the door to the performance area.  The place was packed...  Neary showed Beck how to play darts, and they played for a while (Beck started off by getting a bullseye, but then it went a little downhill...  most likely due to the alcohol).  Sean Brimhall showed up and then Alex and his friend Dave got there.  The music started and the guinness was flowing, and all was good with the world :)  We could hear the music pretty well, and even though we weren't in the performance room we participated in the audience portions of the music.  During "Black Velvet Band" we'd yell out "Diamonds!" and "And she was!" even if we were in the middle of a conversation.  So, it went something like this: "Yeah, I was going to go down there (AND SHE WAS!) but then I decided not to..."  Very funny.    we were getting pretty hella drunk (well, at least beck and i were) and so we decided that we  needed  french fries and gravy.  you know, when you're drunk, french fries and gravy sound like the best thing in the world, and when you get them, they taste like steak.  soyeah.  we chowed down for a bit, then beck and i took a trip to the bathroom, and when we got back there were two fries left.  beck ate one, and the last one was coated in the gravy.  so brimhall hands me this fork, and i'm about to stick it in the fry when i think, "where did this fork come from?" and so i asked him if it was used and he said no, that it had been sitting there the whole time, and that was a good enough answer for me at the time, so i dug in.  but thinking on it now, where had that fork been sitting?  that's kinda a little gross.  i bet it was on the glass case that we had our beers on, and that's a bit scummy.  ah well, didn't kill me...    so we abandoned our board and congregated by the door to the performance room so that we could see the show.  We participated in the "Barley Mow" (a song in which you have to consume an entire pint of Guinness during it) and Rick, the singer said that he was getting a lot of participation from our side of the room but "dick" from the other side.  We cheered, and thought it was great that we were better participators and we didn't pay cover.  After the Barley Mow, I was pretty much just extremely ass drunk.  They played "Tim Finnigan's Wake", another song that you particpate in, and it was awesome.  The singer for that song, John, sang the first line, and everyone in the room cheered so loud and so long, he sang it again. Rock.  Very awesome show.  They played "All of the Hard Days are Gone" and "I Used to Work in Chicago" because I think there might have been a riot if they didn't, and at the very end the big guy, Mike, who has the most awesome voice, sang "The Parting Glass."  Incredible show :)  The only thing missing was Beck and I didn't hear them play "Me and Julio" (Neary said they played it during the first set, but I don't remember that at all).  Soyeah.  Every time I see them, I can't wait to see them again.  They rock.  They're playing Saturday at McGeary's and I want to go so bad...  I think I've decided that I'm definately going, but I just need to find at least one other person to go with me....  any takers?    soyeah.  we left after the show.  I ran into Keith, who was really busy that night, but i still kind of felt like he was ignoring me again (whatever) and he asked if we were leaving.  I said, yes, and he said he'd try and call me this week if he wasn't to busy (blah blah blah) and i was like, ok, whatever, and then he asked me if i was ok (i guess i must've looked like i was going to fall over or something) and i said, "i'm really really drunk" and i smiled and he laughed and i turned around and left.  I dunno.  I guess he doesn't hate me, and that's all i wanted (cause i'm not going to pursue anything with a guy who's got 2 kids).

       friday on the way home from the parting glass   so we headed home.  I was fine to drive having only had one beer at the bar when we first got there, and we were there for at least 3 hours.  for some reason i decided to take route 50 back to clifton park instead of the northway.  i was cruising down the road when suddenly lights began flashing behind me...  yeah, i got pulled over.  i was like, dammit, i'm getting pulled over.  honestly, i didn't realize i was speeding.  it was late and there wasn't anyone else on the road except for a taxi in front of me, and i must've been going about the same speed as he was because i wasn't catching up or anything.  butyeah, generally i just drive the speed that feels comfortable to me.  i had good music (HOTD) playing so the speed happened to be a bit fast...  soyeah.  i pulled over and beck reminded me to turn down my music and eric and sarah sat there and didn't say a word.  so the cop came up to my car and said, "can i see your license and registration?" and he kinda sounded mean at first.  so i fumbled around and found my license and looked for my registration, acting like this was the first time i'd ever gotten pulled over.  then i realized that i didn't have my registration with me (not unusual...  i never have it when i get pulled over), so i looked up at the cop and said "i think my registration's in my other wallett" and i made sure that it sounded like i was going to cry and i made my eyes all big and i looked at him like, "oh my god, mr. cop, please don't arrest me!"  and so he asked me who my car was registered to and i said, "my father."  He asked me if I knew why he pulled me over, and I tried to look really ashamed (I opened my eyes really wide and kinda bit my lower lip) and shook my head.  and he kinda laughed and said, "you were going a little quick there" then he told me that he "had me up to 75 in a 45."  he asked me if i had any problems with my license or anything and i shook my head and widened my eyes and said "no" like, "gee how could you think that, i'm just an innocent little girl."  see, there are no problems with my license (i think) but i didn't want to give him any cause to go back and run the license cause i was tired and that takes forever and i wanted to go home.  so then he asked me where i was coming from and i told him saratoga, then he asked where in saratoga and i told him the parting glass and he asked if it was busy and i said no.  then he asked if i had anything to drink, and i told him i had one beer at 8 o'clock (weird that i spit that time out.  we didn't get there until 11...  but i did have a beer at 8... with dinner...) so then he asked his partner to "get the box" and told me that any time someone says they've had something to drink they have to blow the breathalyzer.  so i'm glad that among my friends is a trooper who thinks it's funny to go to the barracks after we've been at a bar and see how drunk we are, because if i hadn't known that breathalyzers sound like those little toy whistles when you blow them i would have gotten hysterical.  soyeah.  while the other guy was getting "the box" the cop at the car (who i now noticed was a trooper and not a local cop, which made me relax, cause then i pretty much knew i wasn't getting a ticket - first of all, i never get tickets, but a trooper is easier to get out of a ticket than a local cop) said, you don't look like you've had much to drink, let me see your eyes and he shined his light in my eyes (and while he was doing that I totally was making eye contact and flirting...  i'm so bad...  but actually, he was really cute).  Then the other guy was back with the box and i blew and i was fine.  then the cute cop said, "i'm going to cut you a break tonight... just slow it down for me, ok?"  i think i said thank you (i hope i did) and then they walked back to their car.  i pressed the window up button and told beck to not start laughing until i got the window all the way up...  then we totally cracked up.  i am invincible.  i totally rock at not getting the tickets :)  (i love being a girl)

       friday at the parting glass   so we arrived at the parting glass and got our guinnesses and found a spot in the front room to plant ourselves.  Neary was there with his family, and he came over and joined us for a while.  After a little while, Eric and Sarah decided to go into the dart room and play some darts.  Dodi went back there so she could say hi to Keith and see if he was still going to be annoying.  He told her that he meant to call me but he's been so busy with Christmas and working blah blah blah.  Whatever.  I don't really care.  Also, it doesn't explain why he had to ignore me the other night.  Yeah, whatever.  Anyway.  I ran into him later and he gave me the same story, and I was like, ok, whatever and he told me he'd find me up front later so he could talk for a bit.  He did come up later, and we talked for a couple minutes.  He asked if we were going out afterwards and I told him no, that i was feeling pretty sick with my cold and i was probably going home.  Then he went back to work and later I headed to the dart room because Dodi was leaving and Beck was back there with Neary and Eric and Sarah were still back there playing darts.  I ran into Keith again, and he said that he was just getting off of work and said he'd be over in a few.  I played some shuffleboard type game with Neary (he beat me) then with Beck (I beat her).  Keith came over and talked to us while we were playing and we told him that we'd be there the next night for Hair of the Dog.  Neary discovered that Keith had thrown him out (or, "asked him to leave") a few times before.  It was pretty late by that time (2am) and Eric and Sarah seemed pretty tired, so we headed home...

       friday on the way to the parting glass   so we decided to just take my car even though we'd have to go through Clifton Park and we could've dropped beck's car off because neither of us like driving alone and I had the HOTD in my car.  we drove down new scotland ave i stopped at a red light.  then traffic started moving.  it was stopandgo, and suddenly the woman in front of me stopped.  i braked, but the road was covered in slush and my car slid into hers.  suck.  her license plate fell off, and there was some patches where her paint flaked off, but otherwise there was no damage.  my license plate holder cracked and my plate got bent and there was a small spot where my paint got fucked up, but other than that my car was fine.  and this woman was such a bitch.  we did the insurance thing, but i told her i wasn't going to bother making a claim because the damage was so small.  then she wanted to check my license and my insurance card to see that i'd given her the correct info.  ew.  not to be hella really snotty, but i'm from clifton park.  i'm not some random scumbag from albany.  (ok, that was really snotty.  but i don't care.)  anyway.  it was very irritating and it dampened my mood for a bit, but later i just decided to own it and it didn't bother me anymore.    so then we picked up eric and his girlfriend sarah and went up north...

      so this was a pretty great weekend (finally, after a string of pretty shitty ones).     friday dinner at my place   so i cooked dinner for beck and myself friday night.  i made a version of chicken continental, and it turned out  awesome !  well, i thought so, and beck seemed to think so.  i've got leftovers and as soon as i can afford to buy rice (how sad is that?) i'll be able to eat them.  rock.  yeah.  so we enjoyed the chicken and the salad (mesculin greens with chick peas, tomato, clover sprouts and bacon bits (the soft kind) with raspberry vinagrette dressing) and the guinness (always enjoyable) while we watched sex and the city and then we exchanged christmas gifts.   Beck got me a tin Guinness sign (it's the one with the happy pint trying to get the last drip of guinness from the bottle and it says "there's nothing like a guinness"), two of these weird little figures from hallmark that are just so strange they make us hysterical every time we look at them in the store (she got me the potato farmer - he's really ugly and surly looking and his head comes off - and the cow - who she named stupid cow because it says "moo" on the side of it, like you didn't know that's what cows say), and a little grow your own patch of grass kit (rock!).  I got her a gift certificate to Victoria's Secret (I know, seems like a weird gift to give a friend, but truly, it was perfect, we shop there all the time...  and single and fabulous girls can always use more cute underwear).  Then we danced around like the freaks that we are to "Me and Julio" by HOTD in my living room (gotta do the butt dance to that one).  Then it was time to go to the Parting Glass...

      so today i had to call a guy who was involved in an accident a couple of days ago.  he was the driver of a car that my company insures.  but he's not the owner of the vehicle and he's not on the policy.  but his last name is the same as the policyholder's.  so i figured that they're related in some way.  but since he's not on the policy, i needed to get a statement from the policyholder stating that the guy who drove her car had her permission to do so.  but i've been calling the policyholder's house for the last 2 days and getting this weird fast busy signal.  so i went ahead and called the driver today and i got a hold of him.  soyeah.  so i get the guy on the phone and i told him that i was in receipt of a report of an accident that he was involved in and he says "yeah, that was on tuesday", and i'm like, "right, can you give me a description of the accident".  so he goes through his story and i say, "ok, well you are not the owner of the vehicle.."  and he says, "right, i'm in the process of getting that switched over to my name..." and i say, "ok, well since you were not listed as the owner of the vehicle or the policyholder of the insurance on the car at the time of the accident i'm going to need to get a statement of permission from the policyholder.  i've been trying to call her house but i've been getting this weird fast busy signal..." and he says, "right, she, um, passed away a few days ago."  and now i feel like the biggest tool in the world.  i mean, here this guys..  i don't know, probably mother, just died, he just got into an accident using her old car and now i'm saying that i need permission from his dead mother saying that he could use the car...  so i'm like, "oh, geez, um, i...  i'm sorry..." and then i didn't know what to tell him.  he sounded like he was going to cry any minute.  and he's going on about how he's trying to get everything switched over to his name...  so i told him that i'd need to speak with my supervisor and find out what i had to do in that situation and that he'd be hearing from me and i ended the call.  but then i thought it was funny...  i mean, i almost said that i thought the line was dead when i was trying to call her house.  god, how insensitive would that have been?  and then, my supervisor is all suspiscious of him, saying, "well, i wonder how long she's been dead for...  she may have been dead for years and he's been using her name to get insurance/credit/etc..."  and i'm staring at her and all i could think of was Ferris Bueller's Day Off when Mr. Mooney is saying to who he thinks is Ferris on the phone, "well, roll her old bones down here" and i'm wondering if she's going to make me call this guy back and have him send a copy of the death certificate.  but thankfully she just called the agent and verified that the woman died two weeks ago.  so i'm still wondering what i have to do about this...  i guess i could call a psychic in and have a seance (i know i spelled that wrong) and we could communicate with the dead....  "lady, is it ok that your son drove your car?"  "nooooo"  "ok, thanks... um, do you mind if i turn the recorder on and can you moan that for me again?"

I mean, these people know that what they're about to say is disrespectful or offensive in some way.  They're admitting it.  But, they don't want to take ownership of what they're going to say.  They want to totally insult you and then not have to be accountable for it.  wimps.  i say, own it.  if you think someone's a tool, tell 'em.  don't say: "no offense, but you're acting like a tool."  just say: "dude, you are a tool."

      beck and i have decided that we are definately going to ireland this year.  we were looking at a couple of tour packages, but i think we'll just go on our own.  i never used my free tickets to anywhere in the world that i got for high school graduation.  soyeah.  rock.  this year we'll go to ireland (and probably hop over to england/scotland) and then next year...  i dunno greece?  cool.  :)

      so it just occurred to me how quiet my computer here at work is.  my computer at home is so loud.  i need a new fan or powersource.  probably just the fan.  suckage though.  anyway, my computer at home is so loud, it sounds like a refrigerator or something.  it's just way hella loud.  yeah.  actually, i have it off right now (which is why some of the page parts aren't available) because it was just so loud.  but the weird thing is, it turns itself on.  when i got home last night, it was on.  irritating.

      so i hate snow. i may begin every post like this until the end of winter...    I was completely plowed in saturday morning because of the stupid snow.  and i had to have a neighbor help dig me out twice.  saturday night HOTD was cancelled at McGeary's because of the stupid snow.  we ended up going to the parting glass and having a good night anyway...  (but the snow is still stupid)  when i got home last night i had to climb over a huge snow bank because the plow had already been through and it totally plowed in the little path to get to the back of the apartment building and I fell twice and lost my mood ring (dammit!)    soyeah.  so i hate snow.

Did you ever think you were a little...off?  Well, you are.  You're silly and playful, often to point of wacky outbursts, and nonsensical rambling.  You're the type who'd talk in an English accent just to be different.  You like to be prepared, as well, even if the things you bring with you don't necessarily make sense.  You're good at making stuff up on the spot, and tend to have to use the bathroom at lot.

      so when beck and i trade emails back and forth during the day we always title the subject something different (usually song lines or quotes from movies or something) and this last email beck sent me was "Pinky, are you thinking what i'm thinking?" and i love pinky and the brain from  urlLink animaniacs , but i couldn't remember any of pinky's ponderings so i searched in google and i found  urlLink this .

      so i called my bank today.  this was a very irritating experience.  the only number i could find for my bank was that 800 number.  so i called it.  it goes through its options.  press 1 to check your balance.  press 2 to blah blah blah press 3 to derp dee derp dee der... press 211 to get helpful hints about telephone banking...  and so on.  so i don't hear anything that says press blah to get a real live person so i go into the check your balance part.  and i go through numerous more levels and i still can't find one that lets me talk to a person so i decide to just not press anything and i'll surely get sent to a person, right?  wrong.  it hangs up on me.  so a very irritated ali calls back and waits at the first prompt.  perhaps if you wait at that initial prompt you get a real person.  so i listen to it again...  press 1 to check your balance...  blah blah blah.  and then when it gets to the end of its spiel, it waits a few minutes then says, "press 0 at any time during this call to speak with a customer service rep" so i jab the 0.  it connects me to a person... but she's talking and she's not talking to me.  she's talking to the person next to her: "so i told her that there was nothing i could do...  i know...  i know...  but she was so annoying..." and i'm sitting there saying: "hello?  hello?" and finally i just get so frustrated i slam the phone down and pick it up again and dial the 800 number and press 0...  and finally i get connected to a real live human being.  her name is lyndzie and she was ready to help me.  she told me that the teller i'd spoken with in the past was a moron, and of course you're supposed to cash payroll checks right away without floating them and i ask her if there's anything that can be done because i don't want to wait the five days or however long it'll take before it clears.  and she looks in the computer and says, "it'll come off float tomorrow" and she totally made my day.  so i told her thank you very much you've been a big help and i get off the phone happy because i can go to new york this weekend and i don't have to sit at home bored.

      so i think i've been discovered.  i often email during work because it's generally harmless.  in fact, they said that i could give my mercury email to friends blah blah blah but i use my hotmail account...  but then i need to have it opened in another window...  and i feel weird about it and it's obvious i'm not doing work right at that moment.  and i know my supervisor has looked at my screen when i've been emailing, but it's not like i take a long time doing it, a minute here and there, and if it all ads up to a half hour that should still be ok because i'm entitled to two 15 minute breaks a day beyond my lunch which i never take anyways.  soyeah.  so my supervisor (who's cubicle is directly behind me and can always see what's on my screen) was talking with one of my coworkers (who i know surfs the internet/emails as well at times) and my coworker mentioned her frustration with another insurance company because she'd answered the same question 4 times but apparently nobody updated their file even though every time she's talked to them she's heard them typing away.  so then my supervisor says, "maybe they were emailing their friends" and they said something low to eachother.  ew.  annoying.  you know, it's not like  i'm getting my work done  i'm not getting my work done.  whatever.  and also, my supervisor is currently on the phone with a friend planning a babyshower.  soyeah.  whatever.  (whatever!  whatever!  i do what i want!)

       buy your own god damn fucking bagels.   so i need to pour out some frustration so here goes:  first of all, my company sucks.  i sent them the crap they needed for direct deposit, but they couldn't get off their asses and get it working so i got another check this week.  suck!    secondly, my bank sucks.  a lot.  I do all my banking online and through the atms.  so when i got my check last time i was told by my boss to take it to the teller directly and explain that it was a payroll check so that they'd put it right through and i wouldn't have to wait for my money.  so i took it to the teller and told her that i didn't have my account number because i usually use the atm.  then she snottily said, "and why aren't we using the atm this time?" and i told her in my best polite little girl voice that this was a payroll check and that my boss told me to bring it to the teller and inform her of that and she said that she didn't know why because they don't cash payroll checks any differently than any other types of checks and that in fact i'd be better off just depositing it into the atm because the atm gives you a $100 credit automatically while the teller doesn't do that for you and you just have to wait for the check to go through.  so i could see that she wasn't going to be any help so i deposited it into the atm and had to wait like five days for the check to clear because the bank that it's drawn from is a california bank.  soyeah.  so this time when i got my check i was already irritated that i was getting a check to begin with because didn't i send that direct deposit thing in like 2 weeks ago?  annoying.  soyeah.  so i deposited my check in the atm and got the $100 credit but i have a bill due friday that that's going towards and now all i have is the  $40  $35 in my pocket and that won't get me to NYC this weekend like i was supposed to to visit eric and his girlfriend sarah.  so annoying.  and after the bill goes through friday and another check gets cashed i'll have $5 in there until my stupid payroll check goes through and that took five days last time.  i want to scream.  so beck advises that i call the bank tomorrow and confirm their policy and see if there's anything they could do about getting it to go through faster, i mean, come on now, at least by friday.  but i bet i'll call them and they'll tell me there's nothing they can do for me because i deposited the money through the atm but that's what they told me to do last time.  and besides, i can't get the branch number because for some reason it's impossible to find a specific branch phone number in fact in the phone book it lists all the different branches in the are with the same 800 number next to it and that makes me want to scream!  but i'll call.  and that will probably stress me out again tomorrow.    so then yeah i'm very stressed about the company stupidity and the bank annoyingness and then both of those things cause me to be unable to go to the city this weekend and if i don't go that means i'll sit around and do absolutely nothing at all.  and i really wanted to go.  so now i'll have to call eric tomorrow and tell him that yet again i have to cancel my plans to visit them because i'm poor.  i hate being poor.  please god help me to spend less money and pay off my bills so that the money i make can be mine.  and the depressing part about that is that'll probably never happen.  just shoot me now.    and yeah i'm also stressed out because my dad has to go to saudi tomorrow and why does GE need to send him there and i don't want him to be there and i try to make myself feel better by thinking that they wouldn't send him if it wasn't safe, but you never know and anything could happen to him and i just want my dad to not have to leave the country because if something should happen to him i don't think i could take it.    there were many more things that were irritating me tonight and causing me general frustration and upset but i can't really remember them because i watched south park and it was so freaking funny and i laughed so hard it kind of made me forget.    oh, and also i think i hate my haircut and i hate that it takes this page  forever  to load.

      so i have this one claim where this woman called and said that her windshield was cracked and since she had full glass coverage i had her call our glass administrator people and they were to come out friday between 8 and noon to fix her car.  but they didn't come then.  so she calls her agent today flaming about how she took off time from work and they never showed up to fix her car and how dare they make her sit there and wait and her car still isn't fixed and what are we going to do about it.  so the agent calls me and i call the glass people and they say no we fixed that car we were there between 350 and 420 and we put a new windshield in that jeep and here let's confirm the VIN number and it matched.  so i call the woman back and she insists that it wasn't done and no they didn't leave any paperwork and there is still a big crack in the windshield and i ask her to doublecheck and she'll call when she gets home.  but she hasn't called and i bet she's sitting at home feeling like a dumbass because her jeep is all fixed and no crack and how much of a dumbass can she be because it was fixed the entire weekend and she didn't notice.  i wish i could be there when she sees it.

Here's the description for A:   "-A- You are not particularly romantic, but you are interested in action. You mean business. With you, what you see is what you get. You have no patience for flirting and can't be bothered with someonewho is trying to be coy, cute, demure, and subtly enticing. You are an up front person. When it comes to sex, it's action that counts not obscure hints. Your mate's physical attractiveness is important to you. You find the chase and challenge of the "hunt" invigorating. You are passionate and sexual as well as being much more adventurous than you appear; however, you do not go around advertising these qualities. Your physical needs are your primary concern."  ok...  so that's not exactly right, come on now, i'm not that cold.  i enjoy the flirting as well...    butyeah, wouldn't you like to be a K: "-K- You are totally f**king marvelous!"

      so beck sent me a link to  urlLink this article  which talks about a travel company that has chartered a nude flight from florida to cancun.  "Once the plane reaches its cruising altitude, passengers will be invited to disrobe."  souh...  why do they have to wait until cruising altitude, really?  and does the flightstaff disrobe as well?  and what will the inflight movie be?  there will be no hot drinks served on the flight, and nude passengers will have to keep a towel between them and the seat...  that's icky...  could you imagine how cold the seat belt buckle would feel on your lap?  The article states that they feel that it's a stress relieving environment because when everyone's nude, they're all the same.  i beg to differ.  i think looking around a plane and seeing a whole bunch of ugly naked people (because come on now, nudists are always the ugly ones) would be pretty stressful...  can you imagine if you didn't realize it was a nude flight you were getting on?  when the captain says, "we've now reached our cruising altitude of blahdeeblah thousand feet, i'm going to turn off the seatbelt sign and the flight attendants will be around with the beverage cart.  and uh, it's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes."  and when they're landing, will they say, "we are now beginning our descent.  please make sure your traytables and seats are in an upright and locked position and put your damn clothes on you ugly bunch of freaks!"  if i was a flight attendant, they'd have to pay me like, triple time to work that flight.  ew.

       weekend recap continued    sunday   so sunday i woke up after i'd gotten exactly 8 hours of sleep: at 935am.  this is what my body does.  it says, hey now, you've had 8 hours and that's quite enough, thank you, so get your lazy ass out of bed and don't waste the day!  so i was freezing because eric and sarah's apartment (like mine) is not heated in the morning.  and it was damn cold.  so i got in the shower (which thank the lord was warm) and got ready for the day.  at 10am when i was all ready to do something everyone else was still asleep.  and i was freezing and my hair was wet.  so i sat in the spare bedroom that i slept in and looked around for something to do.  i couldn't find much.  actually, i couldn't find anything to do.  eric's computer is broken, so i couldn't play with it, and the tv was in the living room where ryan and his girlfriend were sleeping on the pullout couch and the only book in the room just didn't look interesting to me.  so i sat in the bed covered up trying not to freeze to death or die of boredom.  at 1030 i remembered that my phone was charging in the kitchen so i grabbed it and downloaded ms. pacman and pong and played those for a while.  then i text messaged beck.  at 11 i couldn't take the cold anymore so i ran out to the kitchen and started boiling water in the teapot and hunted out the tea in the cabinet.   couldn't find it for a while and contemplated just pouring the boiling water over me to combat the cold.  finally found the tea...  drank warm tea for an hour until people finally started to wake up.  (to be fair, when eric woke up and i told him i'd been up since 930 he said that i should've waken him...  but i wouldn't have done that...)  so about 1 when everyone was up and moving we walked to a diner that was nearby.  it was so cold, i thought i'd die.  we passed this one street where there were all these little yellow outlines of people painted on the sidewalk.  i'm not sure what they were for.  perhaps they have something to do with kids or school or something.  but they looked like this:  .  So Ryan says, "this must be where all the midgets died."  so the diner was your typical downstate diner, with people of all ethnic origins waiting tables, bussing tables and seating tables wearing various forms of tuxedo type uniforms.  and of course there was a manager guy pacing around, a youngish guy wearing a dark suit.  we ordered breakfast items even though it was 1pm and sarah ordered a small orange juice.  it was priced at $1.20 in the menu.  and when they brought it out it was the size of a shot glass.  unbelievable.  (but cute, at the same time)  soyeah.  so we had a decent brunch and then headed back for the apartment.  on the way back Jenny stepped in some poop on the sidewalk.  and it was funny because just before she did it eric said "you better watch out for that poop jenny... poop jenny... poop  poop  poop  !" and then when she debated whether she hit it or not he said, "yeah, you grazed it with the left side of your shoe" to which ryan added "it was at a 45 degree angle..." it was just too funny.    i parted from the group at the apartment and headed for the subway.  it was a little after 2, and i wanted to make the 353 train to poughkeepsie out of grand central, so i pretty much had to leave then to be sure that i'd make it.  also, i was planning on taking the local R all the way up to 42nd street and then taking the shuttle over to grand central, and that would've taken forever, but i didn't feel like transferring.  but when i got on the subway there was a delay at one of the stops still in brooklyn where the 4 train also ran so i switched over and caught the 4 express and made it to grand central just after the 253 train left.  so i bummed around the train station for a while.  i was going to walk around outside, but it was just too damn cold.    i bought a cosmo to read on the way home.  so on the train to poughkeepsie i wipped out my cosmo and began reading the slightly racy articles with the even racier pictures.  so of course while i have the magazine open to one of the racier pages a nun sits down next to me.  she was this really cute older woman with an italian accent.  and i said, "good afternoon" which is weird because i never say that.  but apparently when i talk to nuns/priests/bishops i blurt out expressions that i never say in real life (Bishop asks me if i have any irish in me and i say "a wee bit" when I'm being confirmed).  soanyway.  soyeah.  i don't know what to do.  i feel like some awful sinner sitting there with this magazine and she's so sweet and i don't want her to see it so i don't know if it's worse if i just close it fast and put it away or just sit there with it on my lap and try not to draw any attention to it.  so i kinda sat there with the magazine as closed as i could get it to sheild it from her view.  the conductor came around and i handed him my ticket and the nun indicated that she needed to buy a ticket to tarrytown and he told her that she was all set, she didn't need to pay, and she was so cute, she giggled and winked at me.  but i was just sitting there thinking, oh thank god she's getting off at tarrytown, that's really close, i don't have to worry about the magazine too much longer.    so the rest of the day was uneventful.  i was lost for a minute in poughkeepsie trying to get to the bridge before i realized that i was right where i wanted to be...  i didn't speed on the way home.  i had to set my cruise control at 74 so that i wouldn't (ok, i know that 74 is speeding, but it's been my experience - and it was my experience last night - that you can fly by troopers at 74 and they won't pull you over).  when i got home i lost my pictures from my camera in the computer crash (dammit!), and watched tv: i was flipping from there's something about mary on fox, the playoffs on cbs and the golden globes on nbc.  soyeah...  so that was my weekend.  wee!

       weekend recap    Friday   saw  urlLink just married  at crossgates.  the movie was ok...  most of the funny parts were in the previews.  i enjoyed it.  i was also drunk...  i had 2 bermuda triangles beforehand at houlihan's.  a bermuda triangle is a drink with like three or four different kinds of rum in it (including  urlLink bacardi 151 ) and it's very strong and they limit you to 2 per guest.  but it's tasty...  soyeah.  so i enjoyed the movie but i'm not sure if that was a function of the rum consumption (love that rhyme) or not.  yeah.  so there was this awesome dog in the very beginning of the movie.  it was adorable...  a little  urlLink french bull dog .  i need one.  that is my perfect dog.  they're mini and tough looking and they have attitude.  definitely need one.     Saturday   didn't get out of bed till 10...  showered and headed to clifton park to borrow money from my wam so that i could go to the city.  (yeah...  didn't get to post about that, but it turns out that my bank just really sucks altogether and my payroll check isn't coming off float until tuesday at the earliest so i had to borrow money from my parents for this weekend...  annoying)  was on the road to poughkeepsie by noon.  drove extremely fast and got there in about 45 minutes.  very scary.  i halved the time the trip should take.  was early for the train (for a change) and had to wait in the cold for a few minutes.  thus beginning my weekend of extreme coldness.  train ride into the city was uneventful...  cold...    got to grand central and found my friends: eric, sarah, sarah's sister jenny, ryan, and ryan's girlfriend corey.  we did the hello/introduction thing and headed for the subway to go to  urlLink the american museam of natural history .  we accidently got on an express and ended up having to double back, and we only got to the museam at 425 (and it closed at 545).  we paid the "suggested admission price" of $12...  why do they call it that, really?  who's going to pay less than that?  who's going to stand there and say, "i really don't want to pay $12.  here's $11" or "here's $1, that's all this museam is worth to me."  i mean, if they were going to do it that way, they should make you pay at the end.  then you should pay what you feel the museam was worth...  whatever.  anyway...  we came in on the lowest level (LL) and we decided that we were going to take the elevator up to floor 4 to see the dinosaurs.  well, the dinosaur bones.  anyways...  so we waited for the elevator, but every time the door opened, we weren't paying attention or weren't quick enough and tons of people with kids and strollers would pile in and we'd be left standing there.  so finally we made a concerted effort and got aboard.  and the elevator filled to capacity (or, really, what i would consider capacity) right there on the LL.  but we had to go through floors 1, 2, and 3 before we got to our final destination.  and on each floor, people would get on.  now, i'm slightly claustrophobic.  not really so bad, but i tend to get a little...  crazy/panicky...  when i'm in a super crowded space.  and an elevator is the worst, because it could get stuck and you could be stuck in this small supercrowded space for god knows how long running out of air breathing everybody else's exhaust smelling everybody around you stuck there listening to stupid people and who knows the elevator could plummet to the bottom and that could be how you die.  soyeah.  so this elevator was  crowded  and there was some odd woman standing across from me by the buttons staring at me with her wierd bugeyes and there was a baby on her dad's shoulders right at head level with me and her diaper was full.  and so i started to get hysterical.  laughing at first silently to myself but by the time we got off it was kind of a crazy giggle.  it wasn't helped by the fact that jenny mentioned that the capacity for the elevator was 6000lbs and eric replied that that was a lot of people and in my head i thought or just a few really fat people and that got me laughing even more.  i was so happy when we reached floor 4 and i could get out into the hall and breathe air that wasn't directly expelled from someone pressed against me.    so we saw the dino bones.  there would be pictures here but when i transferred and deleted the pics from this weekend off of my camera my computer crashed and i lost all of the pics and that sucks.  there were only 12 pictures, but it's still annoying.  anyway.  so there was this one dino that was called an aliramadon or something like that and i thought that was cool :)  so yeah.  so we wandered around the museam for a while and then it was closing time so we left.    so we went to dinner at  urlLink chevy's  in time square.  they told us that the wait for a table for 6 would be about 20 minutes.  so we waited and waited and waited and waited.  and in the meantime some group of 12 came in with this really annoying girl who we dubbed the captain.  we called her that because she kept calling the group her "party" and she kept speaking with the hostest trying to get them seated quicker.  and she was really ass annoying.  she kept pacing back and forth and calling places looking for other members of her party.  and she had a tail.  well, she had some sort of ribbon sticking out of the back of her sweater and i thought that was odd.  i wanted to pull on it and see what would happen.  anyway.  we were all starving and really thirsty and getting very impatient.  everytime they got on the loudspeaker and said "chevy's would like to welcome..." we'd get all excited but it just wasn't to be.  sothen we were getting all irritated and this captain girl because they got there after us and it looked like her annoyance was going to get them seated before us.  and that's just not right.  so when we saw a big table clear up, eric (our captain) went up and told the hostess that that table was ours and that if they sat the "party" there, there'd be issue.  but they told him that the party would be sat there, and that they were clearing off a booth for us right then.  but the big party got sat before us.  and that captain was very irritating.  she made a big show of standing on one side of us and motioning hugely with her arms and yelling to her party, "come on guys!"  we tried to trip them and we gave them dirty looks as they walked by because dammit we were starving and parched and we were there first and it wasn't fair that captain annoying's party got sat before us.  so shortly afterwards we were seated and when i went to the bathroom the captain was there and i discovered that her tail was part of a horrible sheer shirt that she had on under the sweater and i just wanted to tell captain annoying that she should have left the sweater on.  butyeah.  soanyways.  the food was great.  sothen after dinner we walked over to the big  urlLink toys r us in times square .  it was a fun store... i quite enjoyed the huge animatronic jurassic park t-rex...  i was also a big fan of the cabbage patch kids area and the big pink barbie house (i'm such a girl).  we tried some bertie bott's every flavor beans and i had a booger one and i wanted to die.  it tastes salty and eww...    after the toy store we got on the subway and saw the puppet guy.  eric and sarah were very excited that the puppet guy was there, but unfortunately some other street perfomers had the current slot and he was going to be on next.  i didn't realize that there was some sort of schedule for street/subway perfomers...  i thought it was kind of spontaneous...  soanyways, so eric talked to the puppet guy and he came over and introduced himself to the group and thanked eric and sarah for their complements on his show.  he described his show to us: apparently he has these puppets which he performs from behind a purple cardboard castle...  he does michael jackson and limp bizket and i forget what else.  he said that his show was unique and highly elevated and that he was sorry that we couldn't see him just now but that we should go out and play and "kick this ass' town" and come back in about an hour or so...  so we left and we visted eric's office on the 15th floor of 505 8th ave...  it has a nice view of the empire state building and the office down the hall on the corner looks right out onto madison square garden.  we braved the cold once more (and damn, was it cold) to get on the subway and head out to brooklyn to eric and sarah's apartment.  (we broke our promise to the puppet guy...  ah well).  when we got back to the apt, we watched  urlLink eddie izzard  who is this british (executive/action) transvestite comedian and was hilarious.  then we went to bed.    I'd like to write about sunday but it's suddenly after 11 and i'm an old lady who must go to bed because she has work in the morning and so i'll have to write about that sometime tomorrow.

      So, you're interested in becoming a pagan?  You'll need to visit the  urlLink Pagan Name Generator .  My pagan name is "Ariadne Artemis Luna".  (I actually kinda like that...)  Ariadne is Greek and it means "the holy one."  Artemis is also Greek and it means "perfect."  Luna is Latin for "the moon."  so i guess i'm like, the holy perfect moon or something...  i'm excited that Luna got in there 'cause i'm a cancer and i'm supposedly ruled by the moon...

      so sunday beck invited me to come to the superbowl party that was at her firehouse.  so i went and had a good time (awesome bread dip.  truly awesome) and afterwards beck, alex and i went to dunkin' donuts to get coffee (starbucks was closed).  so we had coffee and were served by this weird annoying girl.  actually, it turned out that the guy that was working there also was weirdish and possibly annoying as well.  i guess they only hire weird/annoying people at dunkin donuts.  they had weird donuts as well that night...  the manager's special was chocolate with mint icing and it looked just so gross...  anyway.  so when we left it was suddenly blizzarding outside.  beck and i both attempted going south on the northway (i know...  shouldn't it be the southway when you're headed in that direction?) but had to abort by exit 8.  suckage.  all you could see was snow coming atchya.  and it was trippy/make you sick(y).      so i went back to my parent's house and since both the wam and the pa weren't home (wam=working, pa=saudi arabia) i slept in their waterbed because i figured it would be more comfy than a sofa or my sister's twin bed.  soyeah.  so i hate waterbeds and i'm never sleeping in that bed again.  ever.  i should've aborted right away when i layed (laid? i should've paid more attention during that grammar lesson...) down and my head was lower than my butt.  this is an oldschool waterbed here: just a sack of water...  not the waveless or more supportive kind.  soyeah.  so i was curved.  like this (turn it 90 degrees clockwise): (  so the bed was all nice and warm because it's heated and that was nice, but the next day my lower back hurt  so bad .  it sucked to sit at work.  and you know, it still hurts today.  i hate.  hate.  hate.  waterbeds.  i'm sure it'll be better by tomorrow, but it's so irritating that i have to walk around like an old woman when i first get out of my chair.    anyway.  had to bitch.

They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out."  apparently my AIM smiley is the surprised one:     I am the  urlLink      Which smiley are you?     i am 75%  urlLink in control of my life : "You have a healthy mix of internal drive and belief in external forces (fate, your friends, coworkers, luck).

You also know when something is beyond your control, and you're usually OK with that."  apparently,  urlLink if i were a drug , i'd be beer: "You're beer, congratulations.

      so the other night i had a dream that i was murdering two people.  that sounds very scary, i know.  but it wasn't anyone i know (that somehow makes it better).  i mean, i guess i knew them in the dream, i think i had a good reason for killing them.  anyway, so i decided that i'd look up "murder" at  urlLink dreammoods.com .  "To dream that you have committed a murder, indicates that you are putting an end to an old habit and your former ways of thinking. This could also mean an end to an addiction. Alternatively,  you may have some repressed aggression or rage at yourself or at others. Note also that dreams of murder occur frequently during periods of depression."  okso, i hope i don't have any repressed aggression or rage.  and i hope i'm not depressed.  and i know i haven't been addicted to anything.  so i guess my dream of murder means that i've put an end to an old habit and former ways of thinking.  huh.  i wonder what that was...  anyway.  so it also said to look up "killing".  "To dream that you killed someone, forewarns that heavy stress may cause you to lose your temper and self-control. Identity the characteristics of the person that you have killed and ask yourself if you feel any rage towards this person in your waking life. You may be expressing some rage or hatred toward this person... This dream may also represent a part of you or your life that you wish would leave you alone and stop creating a nuisance. Killing may represent the killing off of old parts of yourself and old habits."  ok.  well, i'm hoping that i'm not heading for some sort of heavy stress.  and i don't know who these people i've killed were, so the characteristic thing doesn't really apply.  hmm..  then we're back to the habits/old parts/ways thing.  i must've recently changed my ways of thinking about something.  cause i'm not sure what habit i might have broken...  anyway.  disturbing to dream that you're murdering people...

      i was just watching  urlLink true life : i have a phobia on  urlLink mtv .  they were following 4 people who had fears so irrational they avoided common situations that they knew weren't dangerous.  now, i understand what that's like.  i am definately aracnaphobic.  but they had 2 girls on there that i just couldn't help laughing at.  one girl was from brooklyn and she was terrified of cats.  she was describing how a cat would come up and try and sniff you and rub up against your leg and it was just grossing her out.  then her boyfriend meowed at her and she flipped out.  and it was just insane to me.  another girl was afraid of midgets.  afraid of midgets.  she was terrified that they were going to grab her knees or something.  that is just awful.  i kept laughing at these girls.  then i thought, i wonder if people think that my fear of spiders is that insane.  but really, come on now, spiders are just  so gross .  i mean, they're all creepy and nasty with their eight legs and they're evil.  they're just evil.  ick.  oh god, i've probably jinxed myself now.  i'm gonna find one in the bathroom or in my bed (EEEEWWWW!!!!)

      so last night i went shopping after work (and i didn't end up running into anyone from the past that i didn't want to see as my horoscope said i might) and i got a red jacket at macy's for $24.98.  rock.  it's all warm too :)  anyway, that really wasn't what i wanted to post about.    soyeah.  so i drove home and i was really dead tired and i didn't want to park all the way at the end of the row of cars that was there because i would've had to walk far so i kept driving and there was a small spot near the pathway to my apartment building.  so i decided to go for it 'cause i have a small car.  soyeah.  so i started the parallel parking process and i started sucking at it.  really, the spot was big enough for my car but not really big enough to comfortably park in.  so i had to keep turning the wheel and then moving an inch and turning the wheel and moving an inch.  it was beginning to feel like that scene from Austin Powers when he's trying to turn the golf cart around in the hallway and it's just not big enough...  soyeah.  so finally i get the car in the spot and i look to my left and realize that i'm way to close to the snowbank to open my car door.  so i think, you know, perhaps i should abort on this spot but then i realized that i was pretty much stuck in the spot and i'd have to hope that the person in front or the one behind me leaves before me in the morning.  soyeah.  so i realize that i'll have to climb out the passenger door.  not an easy feat in a saturn.  so i lean my seat back and undo the automatic seatbelts and raise the steering wheel and look around to see if anyone's going to see me climb out of my car.  and just when i'm about to climb someone goes running by my car.  scared the crap out of me.  and then i started giggling because i'm just so weird and i can't believe i got myself in that situation.  soyeah.  so i try to climb out and my foot gets stuck at first (damn my long legs!) and i finally tumble out the passenger side of my car, laughing hysterically.    so this morning thankfully the person in front of me was gone and there was no one outside to witness my stupidity as i climbed through the passenger side of my car (yeah, and at first i forgot to grab the door and close it, so i was in my driver's seat and looked over and the door was open on the passenger side so i had to perform the climb all over again.  yeah, i rule.

      so  urlLink this article  states that some people may need more sleep than others.  ok, that's not surprising.  but what is surprising is the fact that having too much sleep can cause health problems just as having too little sleep can.  you know, i slept for 12 hours saturday night, and i felt so shitty sunday morning.  i think it's because i normally only sleep 8 hours and then i'm up...    yeah.  so they did this study in the article where they had people stay awake for 40 hours in a room where there was no indication of time.  wow.  i wonder if they had them in there together, or if they were in individual rooms.  how frightening...  can you imagine?  i think i'd go insane.  and i think i'd rather be alone in a room.  i can't imagine having to deal with other people when i'd been up for 40 hours and had no idea how long i'd been up or how long i'd have to stay up...  i think the other people would be in danger...

      so here's my horoscope for today: "Travelling somewhere with a friend could lead you to encountering a person from the past whom you would have rather avoided. Best to stick close to your buddy's side and get home early."  Ew.  How much does that suck?  I've been having these random dreams lately where I've run into Tim or that he's called me or something.  Right before I checked my horoscope, I agreed to grab dinner somewhere with Dodi.  And then I checked my horoscope and it said that if I go somewhere with a friend I might run into someone I don't want to see.  Great.  Yeah.  Oh well.  If I do run into him it's ok.  I'm fabulous and he's not.  I rock.  :)

      so my roadrunner has been irritating lately.  i think my modem is bad.  it'll connect and then after like five minutes it'll freeze up and i have to unplug the modem and replug it in in order to get it to connect again.  suckage.  so i've only been able to connect for like 5 minutes at a time.  so i called rr techsupport and they're sending someone out friday to look at it.  and wouldn't you freaking know it, after i get an appt to have someone come out and i have to take time off of work the freaking thing seems to be working fine now?  after being fucked up for a week, it suddenly starts working correctly after i get an appt to have it looked at.  dammit.  then they'll come out and be like, "hey there, idiot, your modem's working fine, what's your issue?" and after they leave it'll be fucked up again.  (there must be some sort of law or principle that applies to this.  it'd be the same one that applies to when you finally make an appt to see a dr cause you've been feeling sick for a while you suddenly get better just before you go, or if you make an appt to get your car looked at 'cause it's making a funny noise when you bring it to the garage it won't make that noise anymore.)

      so it was a decent weekend.  didn't really go out, but had a fun weekend.  (beck's gonna get irritated when she reads that...  i always say we never go out and she always points out that we do - pretty much every weekend...)  soyeah.  so friday beck, alex and i went to  urlLink starbucks  and beck tried to get me to focus on planning for our trip to ireland, but i suck at concentrating on anything so she pretty much sketched out a plan and i pretty much sat there being distracted.  afterwards alex and i were in the mood for the  urlLink guinness  so we dragged beck to  urlLink ravenswood  where we had guinness and she had water.  we had some fried mushrooms (which really just looked to perfectly mushroom-y) as well.  yeah...  so saturday i was lazy and slept for a while and when beck called me at noon she actually woke me up.  i'd been up earlier and showered and out to breakfast at  urlLink peaches cafe  but didn't sleep much the night before and really needed to sleep.  so i'm not really a lazy bum.  (i really hate sleeping most of the day away.  it irritates me.)  yeahso i met beck and dodi for lunch at friday's around 3...  then beck and i got coffee with her parents at persnickity's (i had a caramello latte and beck had a fuzzy walnut   then headed over to houlihan's to waste the hour before the movie at the bar.  we did not imbibe too much, i had 2 guinness and beck had a margarita.  i was kinda giggle-y by the time we went to the theater.  when we got there the advertisement slides were still showing (the ones that are on before the previews even begin) and beck and i were talking to each other and laughing and these two older women that were sitting in front of us turned around and shot us dirty looks.  what the hell was their problem?  they sucked.  the  previews  weren't even on yet.  whatever.  so we laughed at them and probably irritated them more.  oh well, they deserved it.  soyeah, so the movie was great!  i loved it!  it rocked!  :)  i love the musical Chicago, and I was worried that the movie would suck it up but it most definately did not.  so so so can't wait for that to come out on DVD.  soyeah.  so afterwards we both just headed home because we were (or at least i was) ass tired.    so sunday i headed  down  up (i always get that wrong) to my parent's house to spend some quality time with my pa.  but he wasn't home.  dammit.  so i spent some qt with my brother: we watched the bourne identity.  that movie was pretty awesome as well.  rock.  i'd love to wake up one day and have all sorts of super spy abilities ('course i'd still like to remember who i was and i wouldn't want to have been shot).  yeah, i thoroughly enjoyed that movie.  so later i met beck to walk around the mall (but we went to Clifton Park Center and that mall is so small and ghetto that it didn't take us very long to walk the entire mall).  we went to pier one and target to walk as well, and then we went to pancho's for dinner.  i love pancho's.  it's this mexican restaraunt at exit 8, and it's small but cute.  the food is great, and it comes out hella quick.  rock.  soyeah.  so then later we got coffee at starbuck's.  we both bought these great stainless steel thermoses.  they are so cool looking.  and i used mine today and it rocks.

      so afraid to answer my phone...  so afraid.    i have a claim where my insured (veh 1) was driving straight down the street and the claiment (veh 2) pulled out from a parking lot to make a left and my insured ran into the side of her.  the claiment claims that my insured ran a red light and she's provided me with a witness saying that he did.  but the problem with that is there's no mention on the police report that he did.  and there's no mention of a witness.    normally in a case like this the police report will say something like, "op veh 1 states he was driving straight down ___ ave when veh 2 pulled out in front of him causing him to hit her.  op veh 2 states that she was pulling out to make a left onto ___ ave when veh 1 ran red light and struck her.  witness 1 states that veh 1 ran red light and struck veh 2."  but the police report didn't say anything like that.  all it said was "veh 1 was westbound on ___ave when it struck veh 2 which was turning left from ____ parking lot to go eastbound on ____ ave."  then police reports always give "apparent contributing factors" to an accident.  on this report it said that veh 1 was going at an unsafe speed and that veh 2 failed to yield the right of way.    see, when you're deciding who's what percentage at fault for an accident you compare the negligence.  so my guy was speeding, which was wrong, and which contributed to him hitting the claiment.  but the claiment pulled out into the street from a parking lot to make a left in front of my insured.  because she's pulling out into a street making a left, she bears the greater responsibility to make sure that it's safe to make her turn.  and according to the police report, the parking lot is 55 feet west of the intersection.  so the traffic light does not control the parking lot.  so it doesn't matter if he ran the light.  i tried to explain that to her, but she wasn't havin it.  i told her we'd accept 40% of the responsibility, which is really a gift because according to the police report she failed to yield that right of way and that's worse than speeding.    ugh.  anyway.  so i left her a message telling her we were standing by our offer and that btw her car was a total loss so we'll pay her 40% of the actual cash value of it and she's so not going to be happy.  ugh.  please phone, don't ring.  better yet, i'm putting it on do not disturb...

      so i'm watching  urlLink american idol  and i can't believe that Simon went the weight route again.  he told this one girl that she needed to lose a few pounds.  oknow, she wasn't the skinniest girl ever, but she was cute.  and i wouldn't have said she was fat.  but he went there.  i think he truly thinks he's doing them a favor or something.  i mean, like the girl doesn't know that she's not skinny.  and simon knows that skinny sells, so he feels like he needs to say on national television to this girl that she needs to lose weight.  whatever.  wait till you sign her and then abuse her.    so there's this one guy called ricky and he sings fabulously, but afterwards he always opens his mouth and just says something so hick/simple you can't believe it.  i mean, with his voice, he could easily win the competition, but he's just such a dumbass when he's not singing, that you can't imagine him as a star.  his publicist would have to be like: look, dumbass, just stick to the singing, other than that, do yourself a favor, don't say a word.    so this girl that was just on was wearing a dress that was just really tight and didn't look so so good, butlike she kept bending her knees and it didn't look so ladylike in a dress...  in fact, it looked like she was taking a dump.  ew.    why does randy call everyone man?  even girls?  is he confused with genders?  i don't think paula looks like a man.    i hate that paula is nice to everybody.  lady, just give your honest opinion.  if someone sucks, let 'em know.  that way what you say means something.    (i love that molson commercial with the guys sitting at the bar and the one guy, ron, with the blond hair says, "the joke's on you, gary."  it's just so slightly odd...  it makes me want to say that all the time.  the joke's on you, gary.)  dammit.  i hate when they do the coke commercials with the american idol kids.  it really really really makes me need a coke.  dammit.  no coke here.   right there in front of your eyes.  fat white guy in disguise.  (you know that ford commercial where they sing "if you haven't looked at a ford lately look again" and it's sung/written by that guy that wrote the songs for toy story and all his songs sound the same?  well, beck informs me that that guy is a fat white guy.  can you believe it?  he's got such a old black man voice.  soanyway, beck made up some alternate words to the song and it cracks me up every time...)  so this last singer is a guy from TN and he keeps bending his legs so they look all bowlegged and it looks like some sort of wierd cowboy walk. odd.  people do really weird things when they're singing.   beh.  why do i watch this show?

      so here's my extended horoscope for today:  Memorize the location of the exits and safety zones. You probably won't need escape and refuge, but that extra level of preparation makes you less worried and more able to concentrate. Things might be getting weird soon, but in a good way. This afternoon should answer some of the questions that began your day. Staying alert and following procedure keeps you functioning at your best. Please others by doing what they expect of you. They're aware of your ambitions, but like so many other things, big plans take time to grow from little seeds. Lay the groundwork.   ok, i'm thinking that a horoscope that tells you to memorize the location of exits and safety zones is not a good horoscope.  scary.  i felt that i needed to post it because if some disaster did befall me i'd need proof later on that my horoscope warned me of it.

      so i have a claim assigned to me where the accident happened in new bedford, ma.  so i need to get the police report for that.  well, i don't have the address for the new bedford pd, so i did a search on  urlLink google .  one of the pages that came up is  urlLink this one .  if you are a big dork or are really ass bored, you can go there and listen to the live new bedford, ma police and fire department scanner.  on the page it says: "To the right is Real Live audio from New Bedford Police, and Fire Dispatch"   real live audio .  ;)  (actually, i'm so bored here at work right now that i wish i had speakers...)

      so the weekend was pretty good.    i did get to see  urlLink hair of the dog  at  urlLink mcgeary's  friday night and participate in the  urlLink guinness toast .  so rock.  they didn't have the one guy there again (john haggerty) who sings tim finnigan's wake etc but the guy that looks like harry potter and who sings me and julio took over for him.  and he did well.  they played pretty much every song i wanted to hear, so rock.  beck and i did the butt dance to me and julio.  :)  it was incredibly crowded there and so so so hot.  there were so many people that at times you were just stuck standing still sandwiched. (which really kinda made me a little panicy at first because of the recent club fire and stampede).  I had a couple of skeeved out moments when weirdos hit on me.  there was this one guy in a sweater who i noticed staring at me a lot that night.  he was behind me at the bar and in line next to me at the bathrooms and then standing beside me while i was watching the band.  and after all night of lurking around and staring at me he decided to throw an arm around me and slur something uncomprehensible at me.  i was like "uh, ok" and moved away.  ew.  then later i was standing next to beck dancing and this weirdo with a sweater vest on comes right up next to my ear and says: "you're driving me crazy when you run your hands through your hair." and i was like "oh god." and moved away.  ew...  that's so skeevy.  i was really hot and i had been holding my hair off of my neck or pushing it out of my face and after that i felt like i couldn't touch my hair at all or else that guy would think i was trying to "drive him crazy" or something.  ew...  it was a night for weirdos i guess.  there was this one guy who was in his forties and he was drunk out of his skull and he was dancing and flailing around and yelling at the crowd: "come on people, are you ready?!"  it was kinda scary.  beck and i wanted to hear me and julio so we got matt to yell it and the guy turned around and said at us "this is an irish band, you're here to hear irish music, don't you people have any pride?"  weird.  soyeah. so saturday i sat around and gave myself a facial and painted my nails and played with my hair and then later i met amy and carrie and their mom and their friend mary grace for lunch at uno's.  had a very nice time :)  then later i met beck for coffee and then beck and alex and i went to see  urlLink old school .  it wasn't too bad.  actually, it was pretty funny...  as beck said, "there are a lot of butts in that movie".  actually, there's one butt in particular that is just too gross...  ick...  yeah.  so anyway, good movie.  go to see it if you want to see a funny movie that you don't have to think about.  don't expect too much though.    yeah.  so weekend.  ok.  so sunday i wanted to buy new sheets for my bed and i found a good deal but there weren't matching shams so i was denied.  suck.  i met beck and her mom for lunch at panera and had a very chocolately cafe mocha and an excellent cheese danish.  then i bummed around my house...  i watched xmen with my dad and my brother (i love watching movies with them.  except for when dad busts out with his engineer "that can't actually happen...").  i went with beck to target later and got pilates equipment (an exercise ball, bands, and a mat) and then we went to pancho's and had great mexican food (rock the chimichangas).  we went with alex to starbuck's later and then headed home.  i felt the need to blow up my exercise ball that night and so then spent a half hour while i was on the phone with beck pumping the stupid little air pump it came with until my arms felt numb.  and i don't think it's blown up enough.  suck.  yeah.    so good weekend: hotd, guinness, spa time, lunch, movie, starbucks, new toys.

      just one hour to go.  that's it.  and then it's the weekend.  but i can't concentrate on work for the life of me.  i'm such a bad employee.  i've been surfing "illeagal" websites.  we have one of those webpage blockers here but i've found that if you click a link like 3 times it lets you get to it.  so i was just at  urlLink hollywood.com .  dissappointing.  nothing good coming out this weekend.  i read the  urlLink review for  bringing down the house   and was surprised that even though they only gave it a star and a half the review was pretty favorable.  still wouldn't pay money to see it.

      so a couple weeks ago i was out and this guy was trying to convince me that i should get a  urlLink new beetle .  he kept saying that they were so cute and that it's the kind of car i should get.  i kept telling him that they looked like toys and that i didn't want a car that looked like a toy and that the convertable ones were the worst because they looked like barbie cars.    but the truth is...  i secretly really want one.  they  are  so cute!  just too freaking adorable.  but not the regular ones, the convertable ones.  i need one.  i would look so cute in one.    so today i spent my afternoon at work obsessing over how they are so cute and how i totally want one.  but in reality i totally cannot afford one even though they're not that expensive ($26k fully loaded - they call it the mack daddy model).  perhaps in a couple of years.  (sigh)  anyway...  here are some pics.  isn't this the cutest car ever?!  i even like it with the top up...  it looks more like the older beetle (totally wanted a convertable beetle  so  bad when i was in high school... i would totally get it in the light blue (see the last pic) which is called aquarius blue or this deep beautiful blue that's called galactic blue.  adorable.

       wearing of apparel... likely to provoke disturbances... is prohibited  okso, i never really watch  urlLink the news  anymore because i enjoy  urlLink repeats of old tv shows  too much.  soyeah.  so i was surprised when i followed  urlLink this link  off of  urlLink msn.com  that read "man arrested over t-shirt" because it happened right in albany.  at crossgates.  weird.  apparently this guy and his son had anti-war t-shirts made and they wore them while they were shopping at the mall.  some store owner or worker or something thought they were creating a disturbance and called security who asked them to leave.  so i guess they refused to leave or whatever (hey, i would too.) and guilderland police were called and they arrested the guy.  they said they arrested him for refusing to leave the mall which is private property so that's trespassing.  ok, i can't believe they were asked to leave to begin with!  they were wearing tshirts that expressed their point of view.  whatever.  so they've posted signs now that say "wearing of apparel... likely to provoke disturbances... is prohibtited".  so what is the determination for disturbance?  because those little chicas who strut around in next to nothing and they're 14 years old are disturbing to me.  as are the older women who wear frumpy dresses, black nylons, and white running shoes.  can i have them kicked out?

      behbeh.  tonight blows.  boring.  i actually got freaked out for a little while.  thought i heard somebody/something at my back door.  freaky.  so i checked the lock to the porch and i'm all secure.  butyeah, freaky...    so beck and i were whining on sunday that the week is going to blow.  but yesterday dodi and i went out and visited beck for dinner.  we ate at the coyote grill, and it was pretty good...  the portions were huge...  i felt like i ate a lot last night and then i still had enough left over to eat it for lunch and dinner today.  beh.    so beck's neighbors suck.  a lot.  we weren't being too noisy last night (well, we were kinda being a little careless on purpose, but we weren't being abnormally loud) and the freaking asshole downstairs rang her bell and yelled at her.  and he was  such  a jerk.  he kept going on and on... totally lecturing her.  and it's like, damn dude, she conceded right away that it was too loud that time and he just kept on lecturing her.  irritating.  there's nothing that irritates me more than when i've conceded in an arguement and the other person keeps "making their point."  dammit.  you've already made your point, i've conceded, now you're just being an asshole.    beh.  i'm in a bad mood tonight.  i think it's cause i'm tired and my throat hurts (WHY DO I KEEP GETTING SICK?!?!?!?!).  beh.  i'm a loser.  i'm going to bed.  and it's only 9.

      so saturday i took a defensive driving course that a woman that i work with was offering.  i figured, hey, i wasn't doing anything else that day and i could use a 10% discount on my insurance so even though it was probably going to be boring i'd do it.  soyeah.    so saturday morning i really wanted a mcdonald's bacon egg and cheese bagel.  like, i felt that i needed one.  but unfortunately i didn't leave the apt early enough so that i could stop before class and get one.  so i just went straight to class (and ended up having to hang out for a bit while they set up) and was baconeggandcheesebageless.  so class started and there were only 5 of us there and the woman teaching it (cindy) was really funny and it was very relaxed and it wasn't too bad.    at 1030 cindy asked us if we wanted a break. so i said, well is mcdonald's still serving breakfast?  and she said, yeah, it's a weekend, they serve until 11.  and i was like, you sure?  and she said, yeah.  so i said i'd be right back and i ran out to my car.  on the way out my coworker meredith who was taking the class with me said, "take your license in case you get pulled over for speeding" and i said, "oh, that's not gonna happen" but i grabbed it anyway.    so i sped out of the parking lot and out of the complex and turned onto albany shaker road to go the less than a mile to the mcdonald's.  and i flew by a sherrif and totally got pulled over.    yeah.  so i sat there trying not to get hysterical with laughter because i thought it was just too funny that i was coming from a defensive driving course and i was getting pulled over.  i dug out my license and then rememebered that i never try and look too prepared ('cause it's easier to look innocent and get out of a ticket if it looks like you don't get pulled over that often) so i put my license away again and tried to work up the tears (which was difficult this time because it was too humorous that i was getting pulled over then).  the sheriff walked up to the car (and  damn  he was cute) and i rolled down the window and gave him the big innocent eyes.  i tried to make myself shake too.  (god, i'm awful).  he asked me for my license, registration and proof of insurance.  i handed him my license and told him that it was the only thing i had with me.  he asked me if i knew what the speed limit on albany shaker road is.  i kinda bit my lip and opened my eyes wider (gee, sir, i have no idea) and he told me to turn around because it was right behind me.  i couldn't see because of his car and i told him that, then he said it's 40 mph.  he asked me if i knew how fast i was going.  i put on the look again.  he told me i was going 60 mph.  (damn).  then he asked me where i was coming from.  i looked down at my steering wheel and said, "you're going to laugh at me" then i looked up and said "i'm coming from a defensive driving class" and i looked down again.  the sheriff looked away for a second and said, "where's that" and i pointed towards the industrial park and said "over in the mercury insurance building" and he said, "where are you going?" and i said "well, i was starving and i really wanted a bacon egg and cheese bagel so i was going to mcdonald's" and he looked away again and then said, "is there more class today?" and i said "yes, it goes until 3" and he handed me back my license and said "here, go learn more" and walked back to his car.    rock!  i rule!  i am the luckiest person ever!  i love being a girl!    i just thought it was too funny that i got pulled over during a defensive driving class.  but my trip was in vain because i got to mcdonald's and they were already serving lunch (damn!).  so when i got back to class and had no mcdonald's they asked me what took so long and i had to explain that i'd gotten pulled over for speeding (but didn't get a ticket).  everybody cracked up at me...  then some of the other women in the class asked me how i managed to do that and i explained my technique.  so if they didn't learn how to be better drivers at least they got some tips on how to avoid tickets...

      so last night i was watching  urlLink cartoon network  really late at night when they have their  urlLink adult swim  on.  there was this weird show on which apparently was called  urlLink lupin the 3rd .  i think lupin is a thief and he's got two friend thieves and there's some inspector guy that's always following them around trying to catch them and there's this chick who lupin wants but she's like a rival thief or something and she keeps betraying him and his friends are like, "tool, that girl sucks, don't trust her" and lupin's like "uh, come on guys, she's hot" and the girl's hair color keeps changing but i guess that doesn't matter because she's got big tatas (that is my least favorite euphamism for breasts.  people just sound like morons when they say it.  they use it down south.  'nuff said.).  anyway, so the show was odd and stupid in that typical  urlLink anime  way, but also completely enjoyable (perhaps it was the late hour that made it so...).  so check out the  urlLink lupin website ...  if you go to the multimedia section you can download sideburns that you can apply to your face (they caution that you should not use superglue) and have that 1337 lupin style.

      so i got a claim yesterday where this guy's car caught fire.  so i had to call him today and get a recorded interview about what happened.  it was a long interview which consisted of around 100 questions, so i wasn't really looking forward to doing it.  so i get on the phone with the guy and he's a talker.  a real talker.  the freaking converstion lasted for 50 minutes (i know because i was watching the minutes tick away on the timer on my phone).  i just cannot wait to transcribe that recorded statement word for word (not).    so the guy's an idiot though.  his freaking car caught fire and he can't tell me which fire deparmtment responded to the call.  dumbass.  of course it didn't happen within the nearby city where the paid department would've answered the call.  it happened outside of the city where one of the local volunteer departments responded.  but he couldn't tell me which one.  dumbass.  i'm like, dude, did you look at the truck?  or the back of their jackets?  dammit.  now i have to do extra work...  what's really irritating is he had all these details about what he did that day ("well we left the house at 11am... or no, i gueess it was earlier than that because it was too early for lunch, so it was probably 1030, no 10am..."), the fire and what happened ("I can tell you for a fact that the fire happened at about 5:46 pm..."), and where they took the car afterwards ("now the road that it's on is either rte 311 or plank road.  i know this because we had a discussion on it.  but i think it was plank road because i have the business card right here and i picked it up on the counter there on the way out...") and everything... but he couldn't tell me who put out the fire for him.  (ingrate)    so he's telling me about the car fire and he's like, "well, i was walking around to the side of the car to open the door for my mom (hey, i'm italian, we're dogs but we're gentleman)..." (and at this point i was laughing at him) "...and i noticed smoke coming from the back tire so i looked down and got my head down there right next to the tire and i saw flames inside of it and they were going back under the car towards the gas tank.  so i walked to my mom's window and knocked on it and told her to get out of the car.  she, being a woman, decided to argue with me.  so i knocked on the window again and told her to get out of the car.  so she got out and i walked her away from the car and then i walked back and unlocked the trunk and got her suitcases out and then i ran inside the diner and asked to use their phone because my car was on fire."  so i'm like, damn dude.  your car's on fire so you just knock on the window and tell your mom to get out of the car and then you take the time to get your bags out of the trunk but you never try and put the fire out?  damn, dude.  when the fire department came they put it out with a fire extinguisher.  (course then they hosed down the car afterwards).  but damn.  i mean, i get the impression from what he said that he coulda put it out with a fire extinguisher which i'm sure they had in the diner.  dumbass.  i mean, he obviously didn't think that he was in too great danger if he freaking took the time to get bags out of the trunk.  dumbass.

(ok, that's not  exactly  what it said, but that's pretty much the gist of it.  so of course i haven't tried to fix it yet because i had to go to work and i won't have time tonight to try and get it up and limping (cause, yeah, that stupid machine doesn't exactly run anymore, it pretty much limps).  so i went ahead and bought a dell.  it's not as rash a decision as it seems.  i've been looking at prices for a while and i figured for a brand new computer it wasn't a bad price.  so rock.  new computer soon.  now i'll be able to sleep at night without having to close my bedroom door because the computer in the next room is too loud.

       on why i hate gloversville   so i think the stupidest people in the world live in Gloversville, New York.  or perhaps it's the whole of  urlLink fulton county  that's moronic.  but seriously, stupid people live there and we insure like the whole town of gloversville apparently.  here are just a few examples of the stupidity of people in that town:   1) People out there do stupid things.  Like slam their hands in car doors.  I've had two claims so far where some dumbass out there has slammed their hand in their car door. 2) People out there apparently just back up without looking.  I've had two claims where people have backed out of their driveways into someone parked across the street.  Duh. 3) People out there name their children really stupid things.  Like Honeybee.  And (ohmygod i almost laugh everytime i have to call this woman) Squeeker.  (who  does  that to their kid?!) 4) I just took a claim this morning where some dumbass from Gloversville backed into a parked police car.  Dumbass.  He was in the parking lot of the Police Department and was leaving and backed into a police car.  It was 1am.  What was he doing there?  What a moron.   5) Girls in Gloversville get married when they are 16 years old.  And they marry guys who are 28 years old.  And that's disgusting.  And I can't even begin to count the number of times I've been talking to a 19 year old girl from Gloversville and I've asked the question: "What do you do for a living?" and they say, "oh, I'm a stay at home mom" and you can hear children screaming in the background.  And these "stay-at-home-moms" almost always live with their grandmothers.   6) Kids in Gloversville mow down little old ladies in Price Chopper parking lots and then never bother to tell their insurance companies.  i could go on...  but i think you get the point.  people from gloversville are stupid.  never go there.

      so...  this weekend was supposed to be quiet...    friday was pretty quiet.  beck came over and we watched  urlLink darby o'gill and the little people .  it's an old disney movie and sean connery is in it and he sings.  it's pretty funny (although i don't think it's supposed to be funny in the way it amused us).  the parts with the leprechauns dancing were freaking hilarious.  i've seen guys dance like that when they're drunk... :)  and there's this one part where the death coach or whatever is coming for darby.  it gets there and the door opens and this big, booming, echoey voice says "darby o'gill..." and it pauses for a second then it says, "get in."  it's just too funny...  :)  soyeah.  that was friday...  saturday i went to my parents house and saw their new dog.  her name is lilly.  she's a tiny little puppy... she's only 10 weeks old.  she's really adorable.  i was so excited all morning to go see the puppy and then i got there and i was like, "aww, she's so cute" and then i didn't know what to do with her.  i mean, she's just a baby. she doesn't really play yet.  so...   later i went with beck to walk.  we were just supposed to walk around the malls.  but then we ended up buying boots (really cheap!  $15!) and  urlLink hella cute t-shirts  at  urlLink american eagle .  so later we went to  urlLink malt river brewing company  to see  urlLink hair of the dog .  so i had a gin and tonic...  then i had another one... then i had another one...  and then i had a shot...  and then i pounded a guinness...  so yeah.  damn.  i was pretty blitzed.  in fact i don't remember part of the night.  i remember everything up to being in the kitchen at steve's house later on.  i did a shot of aftershock with alex and jason.  i remember doing the shot and putting the shotglass down somewhere in the kitchen.  then the memory stops...  i get a few little glimpses of memories...  but yeah.  wow.  sunday was not so good.  i was so so so hungover.  and so sick for most of the day.  i felt like death until around 4 and then i felt like someone had stepped on me...  ugh.    so i had to take my dad to get his eyes laser corrected that night.  it was being done in the parking lot behind a howard johnson's.  sounds sketchy, i know.  but apparently lasik vision has this traveling truck that goes around to different areas. the doctors etc were all from washington dc.  so dad said that the procedure wasn't so bad.  not really painful, but you could smell the flesh burning when the laser fired.  ew...  dad just called me a little while ago.  he can see.  his vision went from 20/400 to 20/30.  that's freaking awesome.  i'm so jealous.  i'm totally saving up and having that done.

       i'm fighting the russian mob   so there's a lot of fraud in insurance.  that's a pretty "duh" statement.  but it's true.  especially in the type of insurance that i handle, which is no-fualt insurance.  soyeah.  so this one claim that i have is hellafulla fraud.  i'm not even positive that the one person exists.  and i'm certain that neither of these women are injured to the extent that their "doctors" are saying.  i'm sure these doctors don't exist either.  they suck.  so i was complaining to my supervisor about it and she said that what i have there is a fraud ring run most likely by the russian mob (because apparently they're big in medical fraud). so now i'm fighting the russian mob.  scary.  it sounds a lot cooler than nofault claims rep though.

      so the us governement has this page set up,  urlLink ready.gov  where they have all these suggestions/instructions on how to deal with a terrorist attack.   urlLink this page  makes fun of the ambiguous symbols the gov't page uses.  and it is hilarious.  :)

      so check out the  urlLink starbuck's oracle .  the little oracle guy is horribly mean looking (and cute!)  it tells you what your personality type is according to what type of drink you order.  i normally order a tall caramel macchiato.

       fireguy, you just blew my mind   so i call the dumbasses that i have claims for at work by nicknames.  like i have bigfatliarlyn and ewhighmaitenancegirl and dumbasswhoshuthishandincar.  and the dumbass whose car was on fire last week is fireguy.    so i got the appraisal back on fireguy's car and it wasn't a total loss (which he was absolutely convinced it was going to be).  in fact, the car looked in great condition!  the only damage was the wheel was off in the back.  fireguy told me that the wheel melted off.  that was an exaggeration considering the wheel was still usable.  soyeah.    so when i saw that fireguy's car wasn't a total loss and that in fact the appraiser hadn't even written for a new wheel i called the appraiser and asked him what was up.  so bob gets on the phone and is like, "what can i do for you dear?" (because bob is a rougharoundtheedges car appraiser i don't care if he calls me dear) and i start asking him if the wheel is still usable and if there was any apparrent water damage to the car.  and bob's like, yes and no.  so i'm like, "yeah, the insured was convinced that it was a total loss and when i got your pictures i was like, 'damn, dude, what are ya talking about?'" and then i couldn't believe that i just said "damn, dude" during a business call.  bob apparently thought it was funny that i said that (thank God) and he was still laughing at me when we hung up the phone.    meanwhile, i get a copy of the title to fireguy's car with a not attached that says, "i sent the signed original to firestone".  firestone is the shop that has his car.  i'm thinking, "moron.  your car is not a total loss.  no one ever told you your car is a total loss.  in fact, it's only gonna take about $650 to fix the damages to your car.  i can't believe you just gave up your car to some random shop."  so i decide to play dumb and i call the guy and leave a message on his machine: "hey mr. ___ it's Ali from Mercury.  i got the appraisal back on your car and it turns out it's not a total loss!  give me a call!"  so like minutes later the guy returns my call.  and i'm all afraid that he's gonna start yelling at me because his car is way fixable and he just gave up the title to it.  so i get on the phone with him all preparing for a horrible conversation and he's like, "gee, you don't think it's totaled?  well, it's totaled in my mind.  i've already turned in the plates to DMV and sent the title to the shop so they can donate it to the fire department and cancelled my policy."  and i explain to him that since it's not a total loss by our standards i can only give him what the cost to fix it would be minus his $200 deductible and he's like, "oh, that's fine.  i'll use that towards a down payment on another car."  so basically, this guy just pretty much sold his car, which was in great condition, for $400 and he's happy about it.  (oh, and he'll get a tax deduction because he donated it).  i couldn't believe it, i totally thought he was trying to get us to total it out so he'd get more money towards it 'cause he was looking to get rid of it.  so i hung up the phone and said, "fireguy, you just blew my mind." and i was so happy that i controlled myself that time and managed to hang up the phone before i blurted it out.

      so i had a pretty excellent weekend.     friday  we went to see  urlLink hotd  at mcgeary's.  always a good time.  it was hella hella crowded in there, and they had the drummer instead of the tall guy.  but big guy did a good job at finnagin's wake.  afterwards we went to a pizza shop down the street and ate yummy pizza (ok, it was yummy at the time.  but i'm sure if we went there in the middle of the day it would not be).  one of the guys, murph, that was out with our friends came wondering in the shop.  he's a  urlLink paid firefighter in albany .  so yeah, they left him at the bar.  and he just happened to wonder into the pizza shop.  so we all sat and talked for a while ( urlLink brazil ) and then we dropped murph off at  urlLink his firehouse .     saturday  morning came bright and early...  beck and i got up early enough so that we could stop at  urlLink mcdonalds  for greasy breakfast before we picked up beck's friend amy at  urlLink the train station .  we got lost on the way to the train station (damn mappoint and their ambiguous directions!) but we got there before her train did.  we went back to my place after a quick stop at  urlLink dunkin donuts  for some rank coffee and watched tv until we decided to head on over to murph's party at the union hall.  we parked (beck drove the wrong way down a one way street.  we told her she was fine at the time, we didn't think it was a one way, but later when i went back with alex to pick up her car i realized that it was a one way) and headed inside.  and started drinking.  it was 11am.  the party was packed and they were playing hotd, so i had fun :)    later we walked down to watch the parade.  alex and i went into  urlLink pauly's hotel  (a bar) and got 4  urlLink guinnesses .  we thought they'd give them to us in plastic cups, but they gave them to us in glasses.  so we just walked out anyway.  i can't believe they let us walk out.  we just walked right past like 3 bouncers at the door.  soyeah.  so i don't remember watching that much of the parade.  then afterwards we went to my apartment so everyone could use the potty.  we walked to the  urlLink AOH  hall but we didn't end up staying long because there were no bands playing and people were getting hungry.    after napping and watching  urlLink super troopers  at my apartment we went to  urlLink Garcia's  for dinner.  alex found a table by the bar that happened to be the "worst table in the place."  we got 1/2 off of our bill for eating there.  rock!  we went to  urlLink the parting glass  to see  urlLink hotd  but we didn't end up staying long.  after a long day of drinking and then mexican food, no one could really drink that much more, and everyone was pretty tired.  so we went back to my place.    i saw  urlLink willard  that night.  very odd.  really kinda creepy.  not scary, but just weird.  and gross.  i had a horrible dream later that i was puking up dead rats.  (oh, that's disgusting)   sunday  morning we picked up eric and sarah to go to brunch.  we went to the halfmoon diner and had lovely greasy breakfast foods.  but for some reason the waitress wouldn't let me order home fries.  i ordered a waffle and a scrambled egg and bacon and i wanted home fries too (I know, piggy, but I was damn hungry and I love breakfast foods).  but she wasn't having it.  it was so very strange.  soyeah.  then later we went to  urlLink compusa  so eric could get some cheap memory for his computer and then we dropped them off at the train station.  beck, amy, and i went to my apartment quick and then were almost late getting amy back to the train station because of those damn ambiguous directions again!  but we got her there...  i went home for a while in the afternoon and hung out at the house for a while.  i tried to take the dog for a walk but she was like the only dog ever who didn't want to walk (she's too little yet).  i met beck later on for leprechaun lattes at  urlLink starbucks  (peppermint and chocolate syrup and green whipped cream...  looked like ectoplasm oozing out of the top of our cups) and we drove around for a while.  then i met carrie at  urlLink price chopper  for grocery shopping.     monday  was such a long day at work.  i couldn't wait to leave.  i was pretty productive though...  it was carrie's first day here, and she came to lunch with meredith and me.  we went to  urlLink bennigan's  for lunch in honor of st. patrick's day.  Meredith and I ordered a pint of guinness each, and got them in el cheapo plastic cups.  irritating.  there was a live band playing, and they were actually pretty good.  they played a whole bunch of oldies and british band songs.  one of the singers sounded like he thought he was jim morrison.  the food was decent.  the potato soup was excellent and the reuban i had was pretty good.  but the fries sucked.  (they were awful, they really sucked ass).  anyway.  so when we got back to work i totally didn't want to stay.  it was  beautiful  out and i was slightly buzzing (i had to end up pounding my beer because it was time to get back).  but the buzz made the phone calls easier to handle so it was all good.    that night i went to  urlLink northern lights  to see  urlLink seven nations .  They were awesome!  They're a mix of two of my favorite genres: traditional/celtic music and rock.  They have bagpipes and a fiddler.  they rule.  it was an awesome show.  before seven nations played there were a bunch of bands, but i only saw  urlLink the jimmy kelly band .  they were also pretty good.  they had an accordian.  (that was a random little fragment.  but they did.  and it was cool.  and who learns the squeezebox anyway?  who teaches it to you?  it's funny when you call it a squeezebox....)  i'd see them again.  anyway.    i had a pretty good st. patrick's day :)  also, my new computer came on that day.  i set it up yesterday and it was so exciting.  i now have a computer that's virtually silent.  rock!  i can sleep with my door open and my computer won't keep me awake!  it's so sweet :)  i made it transfer songs to my minidisc this morning and it was like a billion times (no kidding, really) faster than my old computer.  and it didn't crash!  rock!  yes!  yes!  excellent!

      i had dinner at Garcia's Thursday night. and our waiter at the mexican restaurant was russian.  or something.  his name was serge.  he was very attentive, but also a little wierd.  he referred to me as a senorita, which struck me as funny because we are in america at a mexican restaurant where a russian called me senorita.  when he brought our dinners back to us in "to go boxes" he kept saying "don't forget to take your to go boxes" and when he brought the credit card slips back he said that one was for him and the other was "for your files."  when we left, we forgot the to go boxes, but i remembered before we got outside, and it's a good thing because i think serge would've ran outside after us yelling "hey guys, you forgot your to go boxes!"  last night we went to Delmonica's Italian Steakhouse.  i'd never been there before.  the food was good.  i didn't have a steak because it was a friday during lent but my tortellini was  excellent .  we saw  urlLink HOTD  at Eamonn's afterwards.  i'd never been to Eamonn's before either.  it's kind of a wierd place to see a band because it's so small.  the band was across from the bar and there was a row of rectangular tables between the performance area and the bar and on one end of the room there was a big screen tv that was showing one of the big basketball games (i have no interest in basketball).  it was odd because everyone sitting in front of the band wasn't watching them play, they were watching the game.  in fact, at one point at the end of the game, the band stopped playing and just commented on the game.  and then during a commercial they played "follow me up to carlow" because the song was "only 2 minutes and 50 seconds long."  after the game was over the band picked up again and played a few more songs, but they were done by 12:15.  they played "Me and Julio" (Beck, I totally wanted to do "the butt dance"!) which ruled and during their encore they actually had to ask if anyone wanted to here "i used to work in chicago."  that was the first time i'd ever witnessed them wanting to play that and not being screamed at to play it.  but they played it :)  and i was all excited because i was wearing my shirt that says "bangers" on it and they did the maine verse.  yeah, it doesn't take much to excite me.  they finished up with "love the one you're with."  i quite enjoy listening to them play that song.  the big guy  rules .  looks like the rest of my weekend is going to be pretty quiet.  which is fine with me.  i must do dishes.  i suck.  my entire sink is full of dishes and i completely ran out of glasses and i think the only silverware that's not dirty is one butter knife and one large spoon.  but it's already quarter of six on saturday and i haven't done the dishes.  ugh.  i'm going to my friend justin's birthday party tonight.  it's a board game party, whatever that means.  i guess it means that you sit and play board games.  i hope the game of life is there.  that's my absolute favorite board game.  i love putting the little people in the car...  i heard that there will be jello shots.  so that's cool.    tomorrow i have to help out with state police testing.  i'm excited about that.  i can't wait to see dave and dr. mac again :)  and it's an easy 40 bucks.  sit at a table for 4 hours looking cute while all sorts of young men come out and schedule tests.  :)

      so my russians are at it again.  i received paperwork from a lawyer who has recently been charged with a felony involving insurance fraud.  great.  my supervisor has contacted the Manhattan DA and told them that i'd be happy to testify if necessary.  hmm.  great.  she volunteered me to testify against the russian mob.  she said that she's testified before against them.  you have to testify behind a screen.  hmm.  wonderful.  oh well.  i'd get a free trip to the city out of it.

      so i went for a walk with Carrie after work yesterday, and it was so nice.  i love walking.  i can walk forever.  but i can't run.  i just can't make myself do it.  suck.  ah well.  so after we went to dinner at Uno's and then to Borders.  I found the greatest book at Borders :)  it's called " urlLink are you my boyfriend? " and it's printed on board so it's like one of those baby books.  very funny.    Carrie and I saw this other book there called "Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus".  It's a children's book, and it was completely delightful.  :)  it starts out with this bus driver leaving and he's asks you to watch the bus and don't let the pigeon drive it.  then the pigeon comes on and starts pleading to let him drive the bus.   urlLink here's  an excerpt.  you can just see some librarian reading this book to a bunch of 4 year olds and them yelling "NO!" at the pigeon as he's pleading to drive the bus.  it's great.  at one point the pigeon says "my cousin herb drives buses all the time" and then you turn the page and he says, "true story."  it's great :)  i should've bought it.  :)

      so the country drive in opened today.  rock.  that means summer is coming.  rock!  although this will be the first summer that i'll have to work full time.  every day.  monday through friday.  all day.  SUCK.    i had a pretty shitty day at work today.  i'm getting overwhelmed.  i stayed late; almost an hour.  everytime i feel like i might be making some progress i get more mail.  or my supervisor brings up something in an old claim that i need to take care of.  and it's ass frustrating.  i think i'll keep staying late until i don't have a HUGE pile sitting in my bin anymore.  beh.  it'll get better.  it'll be better tomorrow.    i like my job.  enough.  i like the people i work with.  a lot.  but i don't think i have the right temperment for this job.  i like to get stuff done and squared away.  you have a task, you complete it.  but with these medical claims... they can be neverending.  and there's  so  much paperwork.  applications and verification forms and bills and bills and bills.  and then you have to be suspicious of everyone.  and that's what gets me.  i mean, i like working on the medical portion of the claims so so  so  much better than the car portion.  it's interesting reading the files.  i like reading the er notes and i'm all proud when i can "translate" the medical writing.  but it sucks that people try and lie to you all the time.  and there are these medical fraud rings that suck.  they just suck.    beh.  i'll stay here for a while.  but i'm not doing insurance forever.  i don't know what i want to do though.  i know that i want a job that's not the same thing every day.  it should have flexible hours or i should be able to work from home or something because i just can't be in an office all the time.  (kill me).  also, i should be able to work pretty independently and be free (ok, i know this is impossible) from too much politics.  and it should keep me busy because i like to be kept busy and i like to work at a fast pace and feel like i'm getting things done and helping people.  so... suggestions?

       beware of flying underwear   so i had a nice weekend.  decidedly quieter than the last few and it looks like the next few will follow suit.  but that's ok with me.    but i bet you're wondering about the underwear...  saturday beck and i got lunch at  urlLink panera  and then we went over to  urlLink petsmart  because there was a cat adoption clinic going on.  and i thought i wanted a cat (as a friend for Dude because he just seems so lonely and in need of a friend).  so i spoke with two ladies at the luv a pet booth and was looking at this one little kitty named Cricket.  He was adorable: black and white with green eyes...  he had a lazy eye and his head was tilted.  and that somehow made him more appealing.  so i was saying how i'd like to take him and they made me fill out this three page application.  three pages!  insane!  and i didn't have my landlord's number and they wanted to call him to ensure that it was ok that i had another cat.  so i told them i'd get back to them with his number, but i don't have it (i suck.  i had it at one time.  i'm gonna have to leave a note in his mailbox to get it again).  but i decided that it wasn't worth getting a cat from a place where they made you fill out a hella long application and did like background checks or something.  and also, cricket was already 8 months old and therefore not a very cute little kitten.  the only advantage was that cricket was already "altered".  so if i get a kitten on my own (free from somewhere) i'd have to pay for the "altering".    so then we went to  urlLink Neemer Volkswagen  which is right down the road and lusted after the incredibly cute cars.  they actually had an aquarius blue (baby blue) convertable beetle that was exactly what i want the most in the world but it was sold.  damn!  but hella cute.  i embarrassed a car salesman who told us to go ahead in the building 'cause "we don't bite" and i responded, "you don't?"  so then we drove up route 9 towards Clifton Park and it was a nice day so we had both of our windows open.  suddenly beck says, "i think your underwear flew out the window!" and i was like, "what?!" and i closed the windows...  see, my laundry (clean) was in the back seat of my car and i had a nice pair of  urlLink vicki's  underwear on top and the wind blowing in the windows started stirring things up...  luckily, my underwear stayed in the car but it was just so funny.  i was laughing so hard i was crying (which made it hella difficult to drive).  ahh..  funny stuff... good times...    so yeah.  i got a new jacket saturday.  for about 1/2 of the original price.  at  urlLink american eagle .  it's a light khaki peacoat with brown buttons.  very cute.  i think.  when i first tried it on beck referred to me as inspector gadget but then later said the coat was very cute and that she wanted one for herself.  i think the jacket's cute, and dodi and her friend jessica assured me that it was but i'm just a little paranoid that i look like inspector gadget every time i wear it.    i saw  urlLink dreamcatcher  that night.  the movie was pretty good, but i bet the book was a billion times better.  they did a good job making it still sound like a stephen king story.  the dialog was pretty much right on.  but there were so many things that you could just tell were explained much better in the book.  but hey, what can you do?  stephen king books are so so so long and go into so much detail...  there's no way you could really translate that all into a movie of any normal length.  i kinda want to read the book now...  before the movie they showed  urlLink the animatrix , a short CG movie based on the matrix story.  it was pretty cool.  at the beginning there's this asian chick and this black guy fighting with swords that's pretty cool, but she ends up getting stripped down to her bra and thong (with a lot of butt shots) and that was a little unecessary.    I met the usual crew for lunch sunday and Carrie and Amy made my day with a story about how my ex (tim-the-tool) went into the  urlLink hollywood video  where their brother, Mike, works and asked about me.  Mike told him I was doing great (which I am, rock!) and Tim said that he misses me.  Ha!  I'm so so so the winner.  He sucks.  He doesn't have the right to miss me anyway.  and it's funny that he does, 'cause I don't miss him at all.  I am so much better off without him, and if I ever do run into him again, I'd thank him for doing me the huge favor of getting out of my life because it's a billion times better now.  rock!  i'm the winner!

      so last night i met beck in New Paltz and we went to a benefit concert for Big Brothers/Big Sisters.  Her boss is involved with the organization and gave her two tickets.  Brian Vander Ark of  urlLink The Verve Pipe  and  urlLink Bree Sharp  were the musical acts.  we only saw bree sharp.    we got to New Paltz around 6.  i got there first and was waiting for beck in the parking lot of a plaza very near the thruway.  i had to pee  so bad .  so i started walking around the plaza looking for a place that might have a bathroom.  i was out of luck.  i ended up in a pharmacy at the other end of the plaza where there was a random table set up near the front where people were sitting and playing the quickdraw lotto game.  how weird.  anyway, so they didn't have a bathroom but they  did  have mint chapstick.  i was overjoyed.  i have been in desperate need of mint chapstick since i misplaced mine earlier this week.  and every store i've gone into hasn't had mint chapstick, and that's the only flavor i like.  anyway, so this place had mint chapstick out the butt.  they had bins of it in the aisle where i found it and another bin of it next to the register.  it's like every other place in the world that didn't have mint chapstick must've sent theirs to this pharmacy.  anyway.  so i bought a tube (and i haven't lost it yet!).  then i went back to my car to wait for beck but i still hadn't satisfied nature's call.  so i called beck desperate, and she told me to go to the mcdonald's which was right next door.  i felt like  such  a dumbass.  there was a mcdonald's  right there .    soyeah.  afterwards i met beck in the parking lot of the mcdonalds and we sought out food.  we ended up eating at this irish pub place called mcguillicudly's or something like that.  we totally pigged out, but the food was good.  we had "irish nachos" (waffle french fries with cheese and bacon and sour cream), reubans with french fries (beck) or onion rings (me - they were  hella  good), apple crisp for dessert and guinnesses.  we got hysterical by the end of the meal...  we weren't drunk, but we were very giggley...  we started playing that little hand football game that guys in study hall used to play with paper folded into a triangle...  i went to the bathroom and i was still so giggley that when someone came in and used the stall next to mine, i started to giggle to myself and i had to stay in there until they left because i couldn't stop giggling and i must've seemed crazy, so i didn't want to go out and face whoever was out there...  we decided to find the studley theater (where the concert was being held... doesn't that crack you up?  it sounds like you'd see a chippendales show there or something) around 8.  we got lost (surprised?  you shouldn't be) and ended up driving down the scariest road ever.  it was all dark and suddenly it looked like we were in scary, haunted, kansas or something.  beck was actually freaking out more than me for a change.  we ended up back on the New Paltz campus, but we drove around for a while more before we finally decided to stop and look at a map...  we found the theater and ended up arriving just about when Bree Sharp started playing.  she was very entertaining.  beck and i both decided that her hair rocked...  the only song i knew of hers was "David Duchovny" (it's hella funny) but i enjoyed the rest of her stuff.  the weird thing about the show was that it was in this auditorium that you'd normally see a play in, and it wasn't anywhere near full, so it was almost uncomfortable sitting there.  everyone sat with their hands in their laps and didn't talk between songs...  we didn't stay for the second guy because it was already after 9 and i had to drive home.  i was on the road by quarter of 10 and i was all awake when i left, but by the time i got on the thruway i was almost passing out.  i  hate  driving when i'm sleeping.  it's so hard not to die.  beh.  so anyway, i didn't, i got home alive...

      so my office delayed opening until 930.  rock.  i totally rocked the extra hour and a half of sleep.  now i completely don't want to go in...  beh.  ah well.  i'm so afraid to go outside.  i'm gonna kill myself on the ice thats covering everything.  i almost did last night.  i tried to walk up the steps on the back porch and they were all icy and i fell forward, dropping my new white jacket in the mud and embedding little rocks all in my hands.  suck.

       it's a very billy joel day  it's all rainy and dark outside.  days like this always make me think of guard trips, especially the long ones, like, to Dayton or somewhere.  i used to love napping on the bus on the way to a show.  but only a tour bus (school bus trips were hell and made me want to die).  we'd each get our own row of seats, and i'd shove all my crap on the floor in front of me and stretch out across the two seats.  i'd always have a pillow with me, and i'd use it to lean up against the windows.  i'd throw a blanket over me fold my legs up indian style on the seats (it was the only way i'd fit).  it wasn't all that comfortable, but it wasn't too bad.  i'd rest my cd player in a pocket of one of my bags on the floor and put my headphones on and start up Billy Joel Greatest Hits volume 1.  i'd be awake for The Piano Man, and i'd start to fall asleep during Captain Jack.  my absolute favorite song on that disc is New York State of Mind, and i'd always end up waking up in time to here it.  I'd stare out the window at the passing highway scenes (usually very boring...  some houses, mostly trees...  on the way to Dayton we'd see lots of farms) and it was just so relaxing.  it was a great way to spend a saturday afternoon, and welcome downtime between a stressful morning practice and a stressful/exciting/exhausting competition that evening.  wow.  i miss that.  (great, now i've depressed myself)

      so  urlLink this article  lists 10 foods that you should eat every week.  it says you should eat fish 2 times a week.  ok, i eat fish like never.  then it says beans 3-4 times a week.  i can handle that...  fruits, veggies, whole grains, soy or conola oil (random) and low fat/non fat dairy should be eaten every day...  i can handle that as well (although i suck at the veggies thing).  the article says you should have alcohol every day.  i can  definitely  handle that :)  it doesn't say anything about meat though.  must've been written by a veggienazi.

      i really am not enjoying my job.  it's not just that i'm so overwhelmed it makes me want to die and i feel like i'm drowning or suffocating in my cubicle every day.  it's that i don't like the actual job.  i don't like making decisions about who is at fault for an accident, and i don't like having to be suspicious of people all the time.  every time anyone is injured i have to be suspicious of them.  suck.    today i received a demand from another company to pay them back what they paid to their insured plus their insured's deductible because they believe that our insured was at fault for the accident (this is subrogation).  the police report indicates that my guy pulled out from a T intersection where he had a stop sign onto the main road making a left right in front of their girl.  their girl took evasive action and swerved to avoid hitting my guy.  the roads were slippery and she lost control and hit a snow bank and a chain link fence surrounding a cemetary.  there was no contact between our cars.  the apparent contributing factors to the accident were my guy failed to yield the right of way at the intersection and their girl got "pavement slippery" and "other vehicular".  I'm thinking that we should take a big 'ol chunk of the liabilty for this one.  but my supervisor says that she wants me to offer 50%.  she says that their girl has a responsibility to maintain control of her car.  ok, i can agree with her on that, but i don't think that makes her equally responsible for the accident.  she was driving straight, doing nothing wrong, when my tool pulled out in front of her.  she had a responsibility to take evasive action to avoid an accident, which she did.  i'm thinking that we should take like at least 80%.  i mean, if it were the other way around, i know my supervisor would tell me that we shouldn't be responsible at all.    i just hate to think that i might be screwing people.  i don't like it.  i'm not meant to screw people.

      so why are my days so incredibly boring?  i just took a new claim where this girl's car was stolen and involved in a robbery.  you can read about it  urlLink here .  now why isn't my day exciting like that?  i mean, can i at least have suspects run through my office with police officers chasing after them?  that'd be cool.  not as cool as actually chasing after a suspect though.  i want to chase after people.  my job is hella boring.  dammit!

      so i saw head of state last night.  it was pretty good...  it was weird because it kept cutting the scenes really quick and it ended up being a little random.  there was this running gag where chris rock's character's ex-girlfriend (who dumped him b/c he had "no ambition") kept showing up and talking about how they were going to get married (now that he was running for president) and he'd call for security who'd take her away.  i enjoyed the randomness of it.  and bernie mac was really funny in it.  (this was not a well-thought-out review of this movie.  sorry.  i'm at work and i should be working but i suck and i can't concentrate even though i'm drowning in work here).

      so the party last night was a good time.  it was "bring your own item to consume" so i brought guinness and hershey kisses.  rock.  no one helped me partake in the guinness, which was fine with me, and i ended up drinking my four pack.  i had a good time :)  we played this movie game that shows clips on dvd and cranium.  (so i guess i was off base with that game of life thing.  oh well.  i still like that game).    state trooper psych test scheduling went well.  it was great to see dr. mac and dave again.  and very nice to earn an easy $40. it was a small group, and i was in charge of scheduling the tests in middletown and NYC.  i didn't get that many people, only about 35 or so.  there were tons of people for batavia and oneida.    it's snowing.  and that sucks.  i  hate  snow.  i was going to go to my parents house this afternoon and do some laundry and visit, but now that i'm here i don't feel like leaving my apartment at all.  i need to go to the store though.  ugh.  i just want to crawl in bed and snuggle under my big 'ol down comforter for the rest of the afternoon.  sigh.

      so i went for a walk with my friend michelle today.  we went to the colonie town park bike path and walked for about an hour and a half.  it's  gorgeous  out today!  i'm all tired and sore but i totally need to go back outside because it's just so exiting for me that the weather's actually nice again.  Rock!  so i decided that i'm pretty close to  urlLink thatcher park , and i'd try and find directions online to go up there and walk around for a while.  i found directions.  but then i found this site that reviews parks, and this one woman was saying how it's unfortunate that the only time she gets to go up there is on ambulance calls and then she warns to be careful on the trails and around the falls.  so now i'm like, huh, maybe i should wait until i have someone to go with.  because you know i'll klutz it up and fall.  beh.  i'm going anyway.  i still have an hour until sunset. i'm not sure i can tear myself away from the tv though.  i love the 80s is on again on vh1 and it's totally sucked me in.  i haven't seen this episode yet (1985).  i keep cracking up and laughing like a crazy person.  it's just too funny.  this one guy was talking about hair and he said, "it was a bad time for america.  everyone wanted to look like they were from jersey."  i  love  movies from teh 80s.  breakfast club.  goonies.  and my alltime favorite: back to the future.  rock.  85 rocked for movies.    i still haven't moved.  i suck.  i'm sore.  my back hurts.  that's not from walking though.    i saw anger management last night.  (did i spell that wrong?  i suck.)  it was a pretty good movie.  better than mr. deeds.  and a little random (but not random enough).  adam sandler drove a saturn in the movie.  it was a coupe like mine, but it was teal and it didn't have flippy lights (which i think makes it a 95).  that was pretty impressive to me (i'm a dork).  our seats sucked though.  we were at houlihan's before and we got to the theater late and it was sold out, so we ended up sitting in the second row.  so we had to basically look straight up to see the screen.  i actually had to turn my head to see the side of the screen.  seeing a movie that way is very odd.    huh.  i still haven't left to walk again.  i suck.  this show is just so addictive.  they were just talking about pound puppies.  rock!  damn.  it's on all night.  i should leave while there are commercials on...

      so meredith had this claim where the other person's insurance company called her up and said that one of our guys hit one of their guys and they were going to subrogate to us for damages.  so meredith called our guy up and he was like, "no, i wasn't in any accident" and she was like, "we're going to have to send someone out to look at your car to prove that you weren't" and the guy was like, "well, i sold that car, it's on its way to california".  so she had to deny the subro claim from the other company because there was no proof that we were involved in the accident.  soyeah.  so today some girl from the other guy's insurance company calls meredith back and says that she talked to our guy's pastor and that the pastor told her that our guy felt guilty and confessed to him that he was in the accident.  i don't know how the girl from the other insurance company came about talking to the pastor.  i mean, i don't think pastors are supposed to take information that is confessed to them and go running to insurance companies or other authorities.  did she call him up?  i mean, isn't that some sort of violation of some code?  i mean, isn't there like, some sort of confidentiality thing?  like dr/patient or lawyer/client?  that's just so weird!  then the girl from the other insurance agency told meredith that she told the pastor to tell our guy to do the right thing and own up to the accident.  like she would need to tell a pastor that.  like he wouldn't know to say that on his own.  weird.  of course, he's talking to people about things that have been confessed to him.  i dunno.  maybe it's different for other religions.  but i always thought that when you went to confession and confessed to a priest he couldn't go around telling people about it.  huh.  anyway.  i thought that was weird.

       Syracuse Cops are Stupid  today one of my coworkers received a police report from Syracuse PD detailing an accident that occurred when a Syracuse police officer neglected to put his patrol car in park and it rolled out into traffic.  Apparently, the police officer was parked on a hill heading down the hill and was out of his car investigating an accident.  While he was out of the car, it suddenly rolled out into traffic and caused another accident.  The report included two paragraphs (you  never  get 2 paragraphs on a police report) about why the car rolled out into traffic.  The cop had put the car in reverse and thought it was in park and it sat there for a while without moving, but eventually the viscosity of the transmission fluid was changed (or something like that) blah blah blah and the car rolled out into traffic.  But, the thing about it is, it's still the dumbass cop's fault because he never put the car in park.  Damn, he must've felt like a real idiot.  And the kicker of the whole story is, it's not just that one guy who's a dumbass because the report that we got wasn't even supposed to go to our office, they sent it to us by mistake, it was supposed to go to a Progressive office.

      i am completely not into being awake today.  i totally could not get out of bed this morning.  ugh.  but i actually made it to work on time for once, that rocks!  i hope i can continue to make it on time to work this week.    beh.  i can't wait to go home.  i just want to go home and crawl back into bed.  i should go to my parents' house this evening and do laundry.  i haven't done laundry in like 2 weeks.  but i just don't feel like it.  going up to Clifton Park after work is a pain because i have to sit in traffic.  and it's supposed to snow tonight and i don't think it's going to snow all that much but i don't want to risk getting stuck there overnight and then having nothing to wear to work in the morning and then having to come all the way back up to my apartment before going to work in the morning.  that sucks.  but the couch that i'd sleep on is  hella  comfy...    if i had quarters i'd totally do laundry in the laundry room in the basement of my building.  it's a little scary down there though.  one time (at band camp) my cat got out and ran down into the basement.  i ran after him and Dude ran into the dark part past the laundry room and i stopped because i'd never been back there and then all of a sudden the cat came running back out towards me so i scooped him up and ran upstairs because i figured there had to be something very scary back there if it scared my cat...    anyway.  that's all besides the point.  i'm just lazy.  that's the point of this entire post.  lazy, lazy me.  i should  really  do some work, but i just  really  don't feel like it today...

      friday night i made dinner for beck and me.  i made nachos and guacamole and bean burritos (no meat - friday durning lent) and beck made the margaritas (because i proved last time i suck at making them).  so yeah.  the food came out well.  rock!  :)  we ate the mexican food and listened to the irish music (HOTD) and got drunk and had a good time.  rock. and it was free.  and then we watched CKY2K (beck didn't enjoy it too much... she couldn't get over the fact that she saw that guy poop...) and then I Love the 80s on VH1.  That show is so addicting...  we watched 3 episodes (3 hours) before it got just  too  freaking late and beck went home and i went to bed...  i saw Phone Booth last night.  it was a pretty good movie.  kieffer sutherland's good as the disembodied threatening voice on the phone.  colin farrell was good, but he can't really do an american accent all that well.  you could definitely hear the irish in him, so it was hard to believe that he was some guy from the bronx (i think that's what they said... or maybe it was brooklyn... i dunno).  so yeah, the movie was short too, only 86 minutes, and that worked well for it because really, how long can you watch a guy in a phone booth.  it was also a bonus that it was short because we saw the 1140 showing and so it was asslate by the time we left...    so i've been lazy today.  i didn't get out of bed until 130 but i forgot that we "sprung ahead" last night so it was really 230.  wow.  i never stay in bed that long...  so now it's already 530 and the day is almost over and i have to go to work tomorrow and that sucks.

      ok, so i reread the email that the seller sent me on  urlLink this beetle that i  love   about the moonroof and i realized that i read it wrong.  moonroof and sunroof are interchangeable when referring to the beetle apparently.  the roof can be raised a little or open all the way for this little bug.  which makes it  my perfect beetle .  i must own it.  i can even swing the buy it now price.  rock!  so so so need that car.  so need it.  i'm going to see about getting a loan online with my dad's help tonight and the auction ends saturday.  i'm placing a bid on it, but i'm worried that the reserve might not be met and i won't get it...  or worse, what if someone outbids me?  i keep wanting to just "buy it now" because then i'd know it will be mine (oh yes, it will be mine), but i might be able to get it cheaper by bidding.  i  so  need that car.  i freaking  love  the color.  and it's got everything i want: turbo, sunroof, manual.  rock!!!!!

      so these are the beetles that i'm interested in...  i  love   urlLink this one .  it is just  too cute .  adorable.  and it's turbo :)  but it has a moonroof and not a sunroof.  i want a sunroof :(  but that one is  so  cute.   urlLink this one  says it has a sunroof, but i don't know if it's really a sunroof or if it's also a moonroof (note: sunroof slides open the whole way, moonroof pushes up).  that one is the same color as the one that i test drove yesterday.  i like the deep blue, but i think i like the bright blue of that other car a bit better.  i was looking at  urlLink this one  as well, but i think i've ruled that one out because i'm not sure how much damage the flood actually caused, and the carfax report on it just wasn't too pretty...  said it had four owners already.  i'm thinking that's not such a good  thing.  the thing that i loved about that one was it was silver (cute!!) and it had a sunroof (awesome!!).  but yeah, no.  no thanks on the "reconditioned" beetle.   urlLink this one  is a 2001 and it's dark blue and it lists a sunroof (but again, not sure if it's actually a sunroof or if it's a moonroof), but it has scratches on the pass door.  the listing states that it's an easy repair and that the dealership could do that, so i emailed them to see how much that repair would run.  i don't think i'd be able to get that one though, i think the reserve price would be out of my range...  i am  so  in love with  urlLink this one .  it's so cute.  so freaking adorable.  it's exactly what i'm looking for.  turbo.  sunroof.  manual.  2000.   red .  but it has 67000 miles on it.  and that's  a lot .  so i shouldn't go for it.  dammit!  so cute!    so yeah.  i probably won't end up with any of those.  i'll never actually bid on them because i'll figure that they're out of my range or not a good deal etc.  and there are new listings, like, every day.  that first one is pretty much perfect, right what i'm looking for and within my range (looks like it, anyways) but it doesn't have the sunroof...  and i think i need the full open sunroof.  that was just  too  fun driving the little beetle with the sunroof open the other day...  i'll probably never find the beetle i'm looking for in my price range.  it's got to be at the earliest a 99.  it has to be manual.  i'd like the turbo beetle (because i  like  need to drive fast and because it just sounds cooler: "this is my turbo beetle").  i'd  love  a sunroof (but i guess i'd deal with just a moonroof if it came down to it...  i just  really  want the convertible beetle above all, but i  know  i can't afford it, so i'd love a sunroof because it's the closest i'm gonna get to a convertible).  and the acceptable colors are: silver (prob my first choice, doesn't show dirt/scratches so much), cobalt blue (that's not the official beetle name, but it's the bright blue that the first car was), indigo blue (that dark, almost navy blue - very pretty), or red (come on now, no explanation is necessary for a red car).    yeah.  i might go back to the vw dealership.  the salesguy (dave who is bill) emailed me today: "Please let me know if I can assist you any furthur with your Beetle shopping."  he was a nice guy, and i'd like to give him a commision (apparently it's slow right now) but i don't think he'd be able to make a good enough deal for me to be able to afford it.  it'd be nice to buy a beetle from a dealer though.  especially that one, 'cause it was a certified pre-owned with a warrenty etc.  but...  i don't think that was turbo ;)

      yay!  i went to drive a beetle and it was so fun yay!  i keep talking like the retard from crank yankers yay!    so yeah.  i went down to  urlLink the local volkswagen dealership  on my lunch with meredith today to test drive a beetle.  it was  very  cute.  :)  i test drove a 2000 GLS.  it was  adorable .  it had a sunroof, but that was really the only major option added.  It was "indigo blue" (a very dark navy that almost looks black in the shade but shines a deep purple-y blue).  It was a standard (awesome) and it drove so smoothly.  it was very patient with me (it's been a while since i drove a standard).  my salesguy was named bill, and he was also very patient with me.  i didn't stall the car at all though.  so rock!  :)  but when i went to start driving i forgot all about the emergency break and it made this loud groaning sound.  hella embarrassing.  but i found out that the e-break works :)  Yeah.  so i took it on a short test drive.  very fun.  i  loved  the sunroof.  totally getting one with a sunroof.  :)  rock!  yeah...  i kept busting on bill.  but for some reason i kept calling him dave.  i'm weird.  dave seemed desperate to sell the car.  he's like, yeah.  it's slow around here.  we're asking $15,995 for the car, but that's just the  asking  price.  come back and i'll make you a deal...  but i don't think he'd be able to make me as good a deal as i'd get through ebay.  yeah dude, knock $6k off the price and we'll talk.  i don't think that'll happen.  yeah.    but i had great fun driving the little beetle.  totally need one.  it'll take some getting used to...  i'm so used to my  little  saturn that even a little bug seemed big.  rock!  it's so cute!  i need one!

      so.  gettin' a new car.  rock!!  i am  so  excited.  i've decided that i'm getting a vw bug (but i also really like the golfs for some reason, so if i found a great deal on a cute golf it'll be mine).  i think i'm getting one offa ebay.  and i think i'm getting one very soon.  my dad's going to give me $2000 for my saturn, and i'm looking to spend $10k or less on the "new" car.  Rock!!!  i better get a new car quick, because i  totally  have been unable to pay attention to my job for the past two days.  i'm all surfing ebay for cars and checking insurance quotes etc...  i keep finding good deals on cars in florida, so it looks like i'll have to go down there to pick it up.  but rock!  bonus trip to florida!  (too bad i'll be all strapped for cash and alone so i'll have to just drive directly home).  actually, that's  hella  exciting.  i should drop by my brother's in south carolina on the way back.  Rock!  i am  so  excited!    it's funny.  i used to  hate  the new beetles.  i thought they looked stupid, like little toys or barbie cars or something.  but now i love them.  i want a little barbie car.  i'll be barbie.  :)  i'm insurance adjuster barbie.  or out on her own midge or something like that :)  that's gay.  i'm so gay.  :)  (i'm just all happy and hella excited about a  cute  new car!   :)

      so there's this house for sale in vischer ferry right next to the firehouse and beck keeps telling me to buy it.  like i'm in any position to buy a house.  and i can't figure out why i have to buy that house.  and it's probably haunted.  but according to beck i have to buy it.  i think it's because it's right down the street from her house and even though she's only home on the weekends that's apparently important.  she explained that if she was crashing there (like if we had a big drunken party there which apparently we could only do at that house) and she forgot her toothbrush it wouldn't be a big deal because she could just walk home and get it.  so yeah.  beck: i'm not buying that house.  sorry.

      so yesterday i had to go to a seminar for work.  the seminar was titled: "Medical Terminology: Understanding Their Language".  It was marketed for law professionals and insurance professionals that have to read medical records for claims/court cases.  So you'd think that the seminar would be about medical terminology, right?  ok, no, it wasn't.  i mean, they  touched  on medical terminology at the beginning, but then the whole middle part of the day (less the hour at the beginning and an hour at the end) was pretty much for lawyers who work on medical malpractice cases.  yeah.  it sucked.  it was hella boring.  i was interested in that first and last hour where they were discussing medical terminology and then different tests etc, but the whole middle part was just one huge waste of my day.  beh.  it was nice to be out of the office for a day though.  and meredith and i went to macaroni grill for lunch, so that was cool (but the seminar was at  urlLink the desmond  so i really felt that they should have fed us - whatever).  but yeah.  boring waste of day that kept me from getting some work done here, and i've got  tons  of shit to do here.

      argh.  today is  not  going fast enough.  2.5 hours till i can leave...  ugh.    so in honor of beetle day, i'm listening to the beatles (rock!) and i took a quiz on emode:  urlLink which new beetle are you?   I'm the "Rally":   "Rally  Ladies, start your engines! The supercharged New Beetle Rally is your car. It perfectly matches your revved-up energy level and speed demon tendencies, and its red-hot looks put the rrrrr in racing stripes.   Picture you and your friends burning down some country highway, on a road trip adventure. Who needs flower power when you've got the modern creativity to fuse sleek looks with the sizzle of a Nascar racing mobile?   Think it's too cute to keep up? No way: Like you, the Rally is a performance machine inside a hot little package. And it's not just another muscle car; all those cool features and slick design mean it's as unique as you. What could be sexier than VW cuteness coupled with racing car risk? Absolutely nothing, besides you of course."  yeah...  i'm getting a little turbo beetle... rock!!!!!

      so, i think i'm going this afternoon after work to try and buy a beetle at  urlLink nemer vw  which is right down the street from where i work and is where i went first to test drive a beetle.  i'm going to try and get the one that i test drove.  if you go to the  urlLink nemer webpage  and click on the used car inventory link and look up New Beetle, the one that I want is the 2000 GLS Blue one with 11,000 miles on it that's listed at $15,995 on the webpage (stock number 4695a).  When i went there Friday night to check the sticker to see if it was turbo (it is) and what the miles were etc, the price was down to $15,395, and then I saw in the paper on saturday that it was listed on clearance for $13,999.  I emailed the salesguy (bill who is dave) to see if it's still available last night, so hopefully he'll email me today that it is.  i doubt someone snatched it up because i think it's been on the lot for a while (the picture of it on the webpage has snow in the background).  so i'm going today to see if they can get it down to at least in the $12ks for me.  i don't think that will be an issue.  i'm a little nervous though.  i'm not a big fan of negotiating (which is funny, because that's part of my job).  but it looks like they're looking to get rid of the car (they've already knocked like 10% off for clearance) and bill who is dave seemed pretty almost desperate to sell a car the other day (kept saying how it was slow and he could make me a deal) and it's getting near the end of the month, so i'm sure he'd love to make his quota...  ugh.  wish me luck!  :)

      so yeah.  i got approved for a loan today at  urlLink sunmark  for $12,000 at 4.09%.  how much does  that  rock?  and i've decided to move my accounts over to sunmark because they are a credit union and they don't charge fees up the butt like  urlLink fleet  does.  the reason why i went with fleet originally was because they had online banking and because there were fleet atms all over the place so i wouldn't have a problem finding an atm that i wouldn't pay a fee at.  but sunmark has online banking with (it looks like) all the same functions that fleet has, and they also have a deal so that you can use any SUM atm 6 times a month without incurring a fee, and they have 2 atms in albany so i shouldn't have an issue (hey, as long as i have a check card, i don't need to get cash all the time).  so yeah.  so rock.  got a car loan at a great APR, and if I use the whole amount of the loan my payments are still only $221/month and i can do that.  rock.    so i bid on that perfect happy blue beetle that was in queens.  i made my limit $9000, but the auction ended without it ever reaching the reserve price.  so even though i was the high bidder, i didn't get the car.  suckage.  so yeah.  the seller actually has already  urlLink relisted the car .  i don't think i'll be rebidding.  i think i'm going to go to  urlLink a local dealer  and try and get a good deal on the first bug i test drove.  it's a 2000 with a turbo engine and a sunroof and it's dark blue and it's only got 11k miles on it.  they're asking $15,395, but i'll be going at the end of a slow month to try and buy the beetle with a preapproved loan so i'm thinking i should be able to get a good deal on it. bill (who is dave) should be able to do good for me.  i hope.  i'd like to give that guy a sale.  he was nice.  yeah.  so.  and the car was nice.  and that's hella low miles and i'd be getting a 2 year/24k mile warranty.  and that rules.    so yeah.  beck and i went and test drove another beetle today.  we went to cooley vw which is out by  urlLink hvcc .  they only had one manual new beetle, it was a yellow 1999 with 24k miles on it.  it wasn't turbo and it had no sunroof and it was yellow, so i truly wasn't interested.  but it's fun testdriving cars :)  so yeah.  the guy let beck and i take the car without coming along, so that rocked.  so i drove down to this office park that's nearby that i worked in last year when i worked for measured progress through kelly temp services.  we blared the music and raced through the park and beck drove for a while.  beetles are fun to drive :)  yeah.  so...  that was cool :)  i brought the car back, and john (the salesguy) wanted to make a deal for me: they were asking 14 something and he said he could get it into thte 12s.  but i wouldn't pay that much for that car.  it was a 99, and it was yellow, and he couldn't start it right away... he had to jump it before we could drive it.  in fact, he put the port-a-battery thing in the back seat so that in case we stalled the car we could jump it (which, that wouldn't have really been much help because neither of us would have known what to do with the thing had we stalled it).  yeah.  anyway.    beetles are fun, i'm so excited that i'm getting one.  my mom is also going to help me out with getting a car.  dad has totally been great.  he's giving me $2000 for my current car, which is generous, and he bought my stocks that i got as a graduation gift off of me and he cosigned the loan for me at sunmark.  he  rules .  I love my daddy :)  and he suggested that i ask my mom if she'd help.  i didn't think she would (at all) but i guess i caught her at a good time.  she just got a home equity loan and she and RJ are getting a hot tub and a sauna for their house, so she can't really cry poverty.  so...  i told her that dad was giving me $2000 to help me buy a car and i asked her if she'd like to help.  and she said yes :)  she's sending me my birthday present early.  i'm not sure how much she's sending, she didn't specify ("oh, ho, ho... did not specify!  never kid a kidder...) and i didn't ask.  so hopefully it'll be $2000 as well.  but really, anything will be a help.  so yeah.  so once i know what i'm getting from her i'm going to go try and get a good deal on that first bug.  rock!  i'm a very lucky girl.  my dad definitely rules, and my mom actually came through.  and i'm getting a new car at a time when it's a "buyer's market" and i got a great APR.  rock!  hopefully, i'll have a new car by next week.  yes!  yes!  excellent!

      so it's raining.  actually, it's kinda thunderstorming, but it's not exciting enough (just as i typed that, there was this crack of thunder outside...  kinda freaky...).  i'm sitting here watching the weather channel.  what's that all about?  i mean, it's not a show.  it's a reference.  but it's kinda engrossing...  they're  so  serious about everything.  but they sound so stupid when they're talking about different sizes of hail: "pea, marble, quarter, golf ball, and softball sized hail..."  now they have a severe weather expert talking...  i guess he's like a specialized meteorolgoist.  like the other ones are just like general practicianers ( wow  i can't spell) and he's like an ear nose and throat guy or something like that.  this one meteorologist is like the lead guy, and he just  looks  like such a dork, but he's all commanding and confident like he's this awesome great guy.  i'm so mean.  they keep referring to the severe weather guy.  why don't they just let him run the show?  actually, the severe weather guy looks like the lead guy only like 20 years older...  weird...  god, i'm sleepy and lazy tonight.  i should  really  be doing dishes, but i just can't motivate myself to get off of this chair.  i suck.

      so i really want to write about my car and post pictures, but i just haven't gotten around to doing it yet.  i suck.  i'm working on posting pics of the car.  they'll be there eventually at  urlLink aliwolly.homeip.net/beetle.htm .  if you go there now, all you'll see is a big mess of my work in progress.  i took the page that i made for pics of the bronx zoo and copied/pasted the source in notepad because i was lazy and didn't want to code it all out again.  what i  need  to do is to make myself a picture page template so that when i want to add more picture pages it'll be easy...   yeah.  so...  at work, must do work, am still horribly overwhelmed and am thinking that if i don't get focused i'll never get out from underneath these piles.  ugh.

      yawn.  went to see  confidence  last night.  it was pretty good.  edward burns is in it, and he is  hot  in that movie.  damn.  i've seen pictures of him in other movies and he was not as hot as he was in that movie.  wow.  but anyway, the movie was pretty good.  it was funny at parts, but i wouldn't call it a comedy.  the story was interesting and i didn't predict the ending (until it was obvious way near the end).  so rock.  good movie.   later vh1 had pop up commercials on.  it was mesmerizing.  they showed old commercials with pop up comments.  they showed part of a flowbee infomercial.  very funny.  they kept showing this old woman, edna, whose daughter used the flowbee on her.  hilarious.  edna looked like she was dead sitting there.    anyway... so i didn't get to sleep until 2am.  but i made it to work by the time i usually get here (which, unfortunately, is late).  i was all hyper this morning because i had coffee, but now i ate chinese food and i want to sleep.  i'm drinking a coke and i have tootsie pops with me, so that should be corrected soon.  i hope.  i like being hyper much more than i like being sleepy.    so i'm excited to go out tomorrow night.  beck and i are going shopping tomorrow afternoon to find appropriate going out clothes.  then we'll find sponsers while we're out (guys to buy us drinks all night).  and if i get asked for my phone number, i'm going to give them the ex's cell phone number.  because that is funny to me.  i just think it would be so funny for tim to answer his phone and it be some guy asking for me.  funny.    beh.  i've been writing this post for like 4 hours in between doing work.  i should just do work now...  2 hours left till the weekend!

       everybody's working for the weekend  so hopefully this weekend won't suck or be boring.  beck and i were originally going to go to NYC this weekend, but i'm asspoor right now b/c of paying off one loan this month while at the same time making my first car payment and also paying insurance on my car.  so i vetoed that idea.    instead it looks like beck might come home this weekend and we'll go out saturday night.  saturday it'll be a year since tim dumped me, and we're going to celebrate that i'm not with that loser.  rock!  yay!  so if beck comes home we'll go to Jillian's or The Big House or McGeary's in downtown Albany.  I kinda wanted to go to the Parting Glass just because Hair of the Dog is playing, but unless you make reservations and pay $10 to sit in the performance area you're not guaranteed a good view/spot to listen.  i haven't seen HOTD in  such  a long time.  :(    so yeah.  if beck doesn't come home i'll probably end up going down to poughkeepsie to help her pack up her apartment in preparation for her move to her new apartment.  yay!  she's getting away from her sucky neighbors!  yay!    beh.  i better get back to work.  i hate work.  work sucks.  (i'm whining.  it's a whiny kind of day.)

      dammit. south park is a repeat.  i rushed home and it's a repeat.  but this one's funny.  stick your finger in my thresher.  ew :)  i need to redo the colors for this site.  i don't want to look at the green anymore.  maybe i'll go to white.  easy to read.  i like blue too...  i dunno.  suggestions?  i think i may be ill.  suckage.  i haven't been feeling right, and i felt my neck to see if my glands were swollen and they are.  well, the right one is.  and that feels gross.  like a marble or something.  ew.  i should go to bed.    i went for a walk today while i did my wash at the parents' house.  when i'm "up north" i like to walk in the vischer ferry preserve because i can walk there alone without feeling like i might get jumped and the route i take takes me about 70 minutes to walk when i walk fast, so it's a nice "workout".  today it completey tired me out.  my legs are so tired.  if i was smart and stretched before and after i walked i wouldn't feel this way.  while i was driving home i thought that i'd do pilates or yoga when i got here to stretch my legs out, but now i'm just too lazy.  i'm just going to go to bed.

      so i moved my little tv from one side of the desk to the other. this is so that i can see it from my bed (if i lay the other way in bed - with my feet at the head).  but now it's above my monitor and it's kind of fucking it up.  irritating.  i guess i just won't watch tv and be on the computer at the same time.  now i have to move my bed so the one post isn't in the way...  i'm going to move it so it's diagonal in the room.  that might solve some of the awkwardness in the room as well.  the bedroom's pretty big (it's almost as big as my room at home was) and it looks pretty stupid with just my bed, my nightstand and my dresser in it. (really, i'm just justifying moving my bed because moving the bed just so i can see the tv in the other room while i lay in it sounds gay).  i won't move the bed tonight though.  i vaccumed for almost an hour today and i think my neighbors in the basement might explode if i went ahead and started making more noise.  also, i didn't really vaccum under the bed and if i moved it, it would seem like i didn't do a thing in the bedroom.  am i spelling vaccum wrong? i think so.  vaccum.  vacuum.  vacum.  whatever.

      so my car is so cute, that i feel that it needs a custom plate.  you can check on the  urlLink NYS DMV website  if the plate combo you want is available.  and rock!  a few that i want are!  like "TRBO BTL".  how much would that rock for my little turbo beetle?  i don't think that'd help me if i got pulled over though...  Beatle in 1337 is available as "B3ATL3".  That's cool!  there are a few more...  but i shouldn't do it, 'cause it's 'spensive and i'm poor.

      so my car is a transformer.  if i have the sunroof tilted up when i hit 95 mph it closes itself, and then the little spoiler on the back comes up.  rock!  transformer!  there was an autobot named bumble bee, and he was a yellow beetle when he wasn't a robot.  (here's a picture:)      and apparently there's an expanded set, and there's a blue vw beetle named  urlLink glyph .  i've been trying to figure out a name for my car.  i guess i could call it glyph because it's a blue transforming beetle.  but glyph was a girl.  and i feel that my car is a boy.  beck and alex tell me that if it's a boy, then it's gay.  it is not gay.  most german boy names (and it should be a german name because it's a german car) are pretty gay though...  fritz, friedrich, heinz...  mike at work suggested that i name it gunter.  i kind of like that...  still doesn't seem to fit though.  suggestions?

      so tonight is matrix night and i'm all excited.  we have tickets for the 11pm show at crossgates.  which means that we'll have to be in line by at least 10.  damn.  that's sucky.  the guy that i bought beck's tickets from said that the lines will form an hour  to an hour and a half  ahead of time.  damn.  and that was for the 6pm show tomorrow that she's going to.  11 tonight will probably be worse...  damn.  anyway, so i'm all excited and beck's giving me a hard time because i'm going to see it without her and i broke our "pact" (we're gay...  we were supposed to go see x-men and the matrix together... but i sorta did break it...) but she's got someone to see it with tomorrow so it's all good.  beh.  look at me ramble on about this.  i can't concentrate at work today.  it's warm in here and stuffy and too quiet.  suck.

      so it's all about the bathroom today.  when i was in the bathroom (for like the 5th time already today, i'm a peeing freak) i heard some woman exit the stall, turn on the faucet, run her hands under quickly, turn off the faucet, pull out a paper towel, and leave.  ew.  there was no soap involved in that process and that is gross.  i could tell that there was no soapage because there was no pumping action.  not before the faucet turned on.  and there was no break in the sound of the water to indicate that she would have run her hands under the water, taken them out to soap up her hands, and then returned them to the water for rinse.  ew.  all i'm saying is what's the point of running your hands under the water without the soap?  gross.  this is how diseases are spread: improper handwashing.

       i'm so vain.  i probably think this song is about me.  so when i was at the hair salon saturday waiting while beck got her hair done i realized that i could never work in a hair salon.  or any other place that has a lot of mirrors.  or really reflective windows for that matter.  when there is a reflective surface around, i must be staring at myself in it.  i'm like, fascinated by my reflection.  when i drive and i stop at lights/stop signs/whatever i'm always flipping down my visor and opening up the mirror and checking out my hair etc.  i just got back from the bathroom where i spent an extra 10 minutes in there staring in the mirror.  i am  so  glad i have a hair appointment tonight because my hair is just disgusting right now.  it's all bushy at the ends.  ew.  i have a blue shirt on today and it really brings out my eyes.  i rock.  :)  i will rock much more when my hair is cut and not bushy/shaggy.    i used a new self tanner on friday from bath and body works.  it had a bronzer in it so i could tell where i was putting it.  the result was  much  better than my last attempt with the neutrogena self-tanner that didn't have bronzer in it (i was streaky...  very bad).  but i didn't moisterize before i put the tanner on and i wasn't so good about moisterizing the last few days and now my dry skin on my legs is getting back at me.  if you look closely you can see the cracks in my skin.  i look like a cracked desert.  it's pretty bad.  beh.  i guess the only way to get tan legs that look natural is to let the sun get 'em or to go tanning.  but i'm afraid of the cancer.  i bet the vanity wins out on this one though.  i was at express this weekend and the one salesgirl was wearing a short skirt and her pale, pasty, white legs just looked so gross...  i wanted to vomit.  or hand her pants.  so i'll need to get color on my legs somehow before i start wearing shorts or skirts because i don't want to cause that reaction in other poeple.

      tuesday i met beck in new paltz for dinner at the  urlLink gilded otter .  on tuesdays if you show them your tattoo you get 10% off.  so rock!   it's a brewing company, so we ordered their "beer garden" which was a collection of 9 shot glasses filled with the beers that they were currently brewing.  we sampled, and determined that the really dark ones were really good, the darker ones were ok (i liked them better than beck did) the light ones tasted like perfume or suntan lotion or coors light (gross) and the red one tasted like Killian's Irish Red.  I ordered one of the really dark ones, the Chief Maytaysay (?) Porter.  it was great, strong and then at the end you could taste coffee and chocolate.  i really enjoyed it.  beck ordered their copper ale, the red one, and she enjoyed hers as well.  the food, unfortunately, was not as good as the beer.  our appetizer was pretty good, but the main course was just ok.  i had a portabella and eggplant sandwhich which was pretty bland.  beck's pizza rustica was ok though.  we had creme brulee cheesecake for dessert, which sounded better than it was.  the caramel on top was like a skin, not crunchy like you'd expect.  beck enjoyed hers better than i enjoyed mine.  at the end of the meal we almost didn't show our waitress our tattoos to get 10% off.  i'd told beck that she'd have to handle that, and she did ask the waitress what it was all about.  she said that if you could show her a tattoo before she brought the check she'd take 10% off.  then she almost immediately brought the check.  but before we paid she came back and asked us if we had tattoos or if we were joking before.  because apparently we don't look the type to have tattoos i guess.  so i said, uh, yeah, and showed her mine.  then she looked at beck and asked her if she had the same one.  beck said no and showed her hers.  after the waitress left we discussed how she apparently thought we were gay.  why does everyone assume we're gay?  i don't think we put off the gay vibe or look gay (if there's a gay look).  people apparently think that all the time.  what the hell?  anyway. so then we walked around new paltz because it was a pretty nice night. we laughed at a kid who rode his bike into a pole because we're mean (well, we were laughing before it happened and then it did happen and beck said. "don't laugh, don't laugh" which is really the best way to get me to laugh, so we became hysterical and then felt a little mean afterwards).

      monday was an interesting day.    i woke up at 8:20.  i looked at the clock and thought, "what day is it?  it can't be monday, i'd be at work.  it must be sunday.  but wait, sunday i was in pennsylvania."  so i picked up my cell phone and looked at the time/date display and saw that it was monday.  i freaked out, jumped out of bed and pretty much ran around in a circle before i got my head together and called Mary Ellen to tell her that i just woke up and that i'd be in asap.  i felt like  such  a tool...  work sucked that day.  it always does.  i hate my job.  that evening i decided to go for a walk because it was only supposed to be nice out monday and tuesday and then the rest of the week looked like it was going to suck.  so i packed my laundry in the car before work and headed for my parents' house directly from work.  the gas light came on in my car on the way home, but i forgot to stop, so i figured i'd get gas when i went for my walk.  i started my laundry and then headed out for the preserve in vischer ferry.  i had a nice walk and i finished up around 830.  i got in my car and headed towards the parents' house so that i could collect my laundry and go home.  i proceeded up the hill from the village on vischer ferry road and suddenly my car wouldn't accelerate.  i'm like, "oh my god!  what's happening!  this is a new car!  aaauuuggghh!"  so i rolled over to the side of the road on the way up the hill in a pretty shitty spot to have your car stop working because it was just around a curve and proceeded to freak out.  i called my dad and said that my freaking car stopped working and i was really pissed and i didn't know what was wrong with it, perhaps it was the battery and could he come get me please and hurry because this was embarrassing.  he asked if i had enough gas and i admitted that the gas light had come on but that the little indicator wasn't  all  the way to the empty...  he said he'd be down so i sat there and waited with the four ways on hoping that no one i knew would drive by and that no one would stop to help me because that would just embarrass the shit out of me.  dad showed up with a can of gas and poured some in my tank... and the car started.  again that day i felt like  such  a tool.  who runs out of gas?  apparently this girl does.    so dad and i went up to the stewart's on the corner of vischer ferry and grooms road and we both filled up our tanks and then when we were leaving i noticed that there was a spider on the roof of my car near my sunroof which was popped open to vent.  i freaked out and yelled for my dad to get it off because if it crawled in the sunroof i was going to die.  he brushed the vile little monster off the roof and pointed out that it was the second time tonight he'd saved me then he got in his car and i got in mine and we both headed home.  so i'm driving down (well, i guess up really, i was heading north) vischer ferry road following my dad home and i notice movement on the driver's side of my windshield.  there was a spider crawling there.  i was immediately grossed out and went to close my vented sunroof so that he could not get in at me when i realized that  the spider was inside .  i completely freaked out.  "it's inside, it's inside, it's inside, it's inside" was all i could say over and over again.  i tried to call my dad in front of me so that he could save me for a third time that night but he had the cell phone turned off.  the spider crawled across the windshield to the passenger side, crawled onto the dash and proceeded to crawl at me.  at this point i lost all rational thought and reason.  i slammed on the gas and braked.  i swerved all over the road.  i flashed my high beams at my dad in front of me trying to get his attention.  and all the while i was now  screaming , "  it's inside!  it's inside!  it's inside!  it's inside!  "  i swerved into the ghetto chopper parking lot, took the car out of gear, yanked up the e-brake, unbuckled my seatbelt and pretty much fell out of my car.  i turned around to look inside so that i wouldn't lose track of the spider (really, the worst thing ever is when a spider is attacking you and you lose track of it.  then you don't know where the heinous little fucker is and what it's doing.  it could be crawling on you.  and that would be, well, i think i'd have to die).  it was sitting on my dash above the vent near the steering wheel staring at me.  it had come so close to getting on me.  ew.  ew.  ew.  ew.  ew.  ew.  ew.  ew.  i tried to call my dad again, but the phone was still turned off.  i called beck who advised that i kill it.  well, if it were that easy, i would've just done it while i was driving.  but for some reason i freeze up when i try to kill spiders.  i'm so freaked out by them.  i for some reason think that if i try and kill it that i will miss and that it will then jump on me or run at me.  oh god, ew.  that would be awful.  anyway, so i looked around the parking lot and couldn't see anyone who i thought i could ask for help (it would've come to that had i seen someone who i thought would help me, i don't care that it sounds crazy).  so i figured i  had  to kill it otherwise i'd be stuck there in a face off with the spider.  i had sandels on the passenger seat that i wore to work that day.  i couldn't reach across from the driver's side because then the spider would jump on me, so i ran around to the passenger side, retreived a sandel, determined that i could not try to kill it from that side because i might miss and risk losing it in the car or having it attack me, so i ran back to the driver's side and tried to psych myself up for killing it.  i attempted a couple times and stopped and freaked out.  and then finally i just slammed the sandel down on the spider and imediately withdrew from the car into the parking lot where i jumped around and freaked out because i had been that close to the spider.  i peeked back into the car and saw no body.  ew.  there was juice on the dash, so i was pretty sure that i'd at least hit it, but i had no physical proof that i'd killed it.  i was grossed out by the juice, so i ran into the ghetto chopper and bought some windex wipes which i used to wipe the juice off the dash.  when i was done wiping the dash i took the wipe by a corner and held the spider juice wipe out in front of me while i took it to the garbage can.  on the way back, i noticed that the car that was near mine wasn't empty.  there were four guys sitting in the car watching my freakout.  i felt like a tool for the third time that day.  after i convinced myself that it was dead or at least mortally wounded even if i didn't have the proof right in front of me, i got back in the car and headed home.  i was so grossed out though and tried to touch as little of the car as i could because i didn't want to risk touching either a half dead spider or a spider carcass.     i got home and told the parents what happend and they seemed to think it was no big deal.  whatever.  spiders are scary.

      i'm thinking that, upon approval from beck, i'll be reserving a room at one of the hostels at  urlLink hostelworld.com .  i was originally looking at  urlLink avalon house , but it doesn't appear that we could get a room with an attached bathroom and i'm pretty sure that's a dealbreaker for beck.  and really, it's only $3 more than a private without.  so i'm thinking that we should definitely stay at  urlLink Jacob's Inn .  the prices are the same as avalon house, and they have a prettier website (and really,  that's  the important part, isn't it?).  actually, Jacob's Inn looks like it'll be our best bet.  $40 per person per night for a private room with a bathroom attached.  sounds good to me.

      i've been trying to find hotels in ireland.  i've been looking mostly at hostels b/c they are cheap and private rooms are possible.  i read a review at  urlLink tripadvisor.com  of mount eccles hostel which said, "Went to MEC for St.Patricks 2003. We stayed in a 6bed dorm on the second floor. The place was secure with electronic card entry and storage lockers. It also took mastercard which was a plus. The showers sucked, very cold water dribbled out, but it wasnt that big of a deal. The buses to the airport drop off and pick up only 5 minutes away. Its in a slightly sketch part of town, but all in all I would say its a fine place to stay for the price."  at first i cracked up at the review b/c it said the showers were cold and dribbley but that wasn't a big deal b/c damn, i don't want to take cold showers.  then i realized that the review sounded like something i totally would have written, i mean, the language was very similar to my own (word usage: sucked, slightly sketch).  so i looked up and saw that the review was written by someone from albany.  i was amused.

      so last night was fun.  beck and i met up with her friends from poughkeepsie at the big house in albany.  it seems that people who work in poughkeepsie come from the capital district originally, so that's why they were up here.  beck and i got there at about 1030 and the drinking commenced.  we were told that we had a lot of catching up to do as they'd already had "as many as  four "...  those guys were pretty cool.  somehow i got ass drunk and didn't end up spending any money.  being a girl rules.  i had their "prohibition porter" (big house is a brewing company) and it was pretty good.  there was a girl there on her bachelorette party with her sister and her friend.  she had blow pops tied around her waist sticking out of her pants and a shirt that said "tonight i better get kissess because one day soon i'm gonna be a missus".  the shirt was one of those tiny t's from express, so it had this baby pocket on it in which she had hershey kisses.  her friend was bringing her around telling people that they could take a blow pop out of her pants with their mouth for a dollar.  so we all did that.  when you paid her she'd pull down her shirt so that you could put the dollar in her boobs and she was like, "you can put it in there with your mouth" and i was like, "um, no thanks".  the girl was actually pretty nice and she and her friend hung out with us for a while.  then she went and got her younger sister who she said had bigger boobs than her and she brought her over to the table so that she could hook up with one of the guys.  the guy that she ended up leaving with was the only single guy at the table and apparently it's been a while or something like that.  and, damn.  good for him for leaving with that girl because i was lead to believe it's been a very long time.  but yeah.  beck says that's because he's really picky, so i guess that's his fault.  dumbass.  got ass drunk. we had chocolate cake shots.  i have no idea what was in them, but they smelled just like chocolate cake.  they looked like pee though.  but they tasted alright.  after you did the shot you sucked on a lemon dipped in sugar.  like it was the icing.  pretty good.  anyway.  so yeah.  drunk funness.  i feel that there was more i was going to write about, but i can't remember.

      oh, so i named my car.  i decided that it's definitly a boy and that it should be a german name.  and i was thinking Hansel because Hansel was a fat little kid in Hansel and Gretel.  But he didn't really look like a Hansel or a Hans.  Alex suggested that I name the car after the fat German kid in Willy Wonka.  so i looked up that name, and the kid from Willy Wonka was Augustus.  And i really like that name for my car.  Augustus.  Gus.  I like Gus...  like that little fat mouse in Cinderella that laughed...  Gus Gus.  rock.

      so i got a little turbo thingy for the back of my car.    see, my little beetle is a turbo beetle.  people who know beetles can tell that by the retractable spoiler just above the rear windshield.  but it didn't have any markings on it to denote that it's turbo.  and the other day i was behind someone whose beetle had a little turbo thing on it right below the VW emblem on the back of the car.  i was so jealous.  my little beetle is turbo too and no one could tell.  so i went home that day and ordered one of those little turbo thingys off of ebay for $10.    yesterday i spent an hour and a half vaccuming out the inside, armoraling the interior, washing the outside, waxing the outside, washing all the windows and washing the tires.  my car is so spiffy and beautiful now.  then i stuck the turbo thingy on the back under the VW emblem.  I was so nervous about putting it on, because i didn't want it to be crooked.  it came with a backing over the sticky part and a clear cover over the front to keep it shiny.  i kept the clear part on when i was sticking it to the car because it was something easy to hang on to and it was rectangular so i figured that it would help me get it on straight.  so i held on to the edges of the clear cover and leaned toward the car trying to get it as centered and as straight as possible, and suddenly i realized that i'd leaned too close and it was stuck to the car.  i think it may be tilted just a little bit, but that might be me being hypercritical and i don't think that anyone else looking at the car would think it was.  also, because the car's so round, it looks tilted different ways from every direction.  so it's probably as straight as anyone could have got it.    so rock.  my car is hella cute.  and now everyone knows it's a turbo beetle.

      i like using skins.  you can change the look of your site whenever you want without much work.  and there are hella cute skins at  urlLink blogskins.com .  and i always like those skins  much  better than the ones i come up with...  so i'm using skins from now on.  expect frequent changes in the look of the site.    i really like the current skin.  i think i'm going to modify it a bit and get some pink in there.  i'm really into pink right now for some reason.   urlLink vicki's  is having their semi-annual sale right now (you have no idea how excited i am about that) and i've been twice (since it started monday) and pretty much all of the underwear that i bought so far is pink.  especially hot pink.  love that.  rock!  yeah.  i shouldn't be spending money on underwear because i'm ghetto ass poor right now, but hey, there's always room for underwear.

      went to mcgeary's last night to see the  urlLink glengarry bhoys  with alex, steve, and dodi.  i had a good time, and i looked hot.  (i rock).  i've never seen that band before, but i really enjoyed them.  afterwards alex and i swung by barnes & noble with the intention of buying the next harry potter book for me, but it was  mobbed .  at like, 1am.  there were people lined up oustide the door.  very weird.  this morning i fainted.  3 times.  i think it was because i hadn't eaten since the night before at around 6, and it was only one of those macaroni and cheese in a cup things.  so we went to this diner by albany med to get something to eat, i think it was called quintessence or something like that.  it's in the  ghetto .  it was completely surprising inside.  all art deco and kind of bohemian.  and there was a classical guitarist there playing.  and they had fresh squeezed oj.  and the food was good.  so i think i should be better now.  but, truthfully, i'm not sure that i am.  i'm  freezing  for some reason, my hands feel like ice and i have goosebumps all over.  and my head still feels a little wierd.  i was going to get my shit together and go to my parent's house to do wash and then go pick up a harry potter (if i can find a copy) and go tanning, but i think i'll wait a while before i attempt to drive...

      ended up going to see hotd tonight at mcgeary's.  beck and i met her friends at the hill street cafe before hand.  but they ended up not coming with us to mcgeary's.  we had a good time though.  it was the first time i saw hotd sober, and they still ruled.  the crowd there sucked though.  they didn't know the band or the songs and some of them were actually rude/drunk enough to boo.  i wanted to kick this guy's ass so bad because he kept yelling "you suck".  that kid sucked.  the kids didn't know how to dance to the irish music (apparently if music doesn't have a big thumping bass line they don't know how to dance to it) and some kids were actually grinding, which was kind of disturbing.  but the band was great and they played "johnny jump up" and "me and julio" and "cecilia" and "paddy murphey's wake" and "mary mac" and it was wonderful.  i so love hotd.  we only stayed for a little while because beck had to drive back to poughkeepsie.  i wore my awesome pink underwear under a hot pink baby t-shirt from express and a denim skirt.  apparently pink really works for me.  i got hit on by this guy named "packy".  he came over and introduced himself and i thought he said, "i'm packing" and i was very confused.  but it turns out that his name was packy and that his real name is gaelic and no one could pronounce it so they called him packy instead.  weird.  anyway...  then later this other guy was apparently checking me out (according to beck) but his whole tactic was apparently to stand right near me and bump into me.  anyway.  it was a good night out, and pretty confidence boosting as the last few times i went out i didn't get hit on at all and i was beginning to think that i was the ugly chick.

      so my burn between the girls is very pink.  of course, it could be a reflection of the hot pink bra i'm wearing.  i keep going to touch it because my hands are cold to cool it down, but then i realize that at work that doesn't look so nice...  so i forgot to preorder the new harry potter book and i'm very upset.  i want it.  i can't wait to read it.  all i'm sayin' is, it's only going to take me about a day to read it (yes, i know it's like 900 pages... i'm a fast reader and kind of a dork, i'll devote an entire day to reading) so if anyone gets a copy they should give it to me first because i'll be done with it quickly...  today is exactly four weeks from my birthday (july 17).  so that means it's time to shamelessly promote my  urlLink wishlist ...  love me but don't know what to give me?  find perfect stuff  urlLink here ...

      so i went tanning for the first time ever today and this is what i learned: 1) not all girls that work in health/beauty stores in clifton park are snotty.  the girls at sunsations were actually very nice.  2) tanning is very relaxing.  they have a (car) radio built into the bed so you can either bring a cd along or tune into whatever you want to listen to.  3) i am not as claustrophobic as i thought because i didn't freak out when i lowered the top of the bed (which looks like a funky futuristic coffin on a stand) 4) i burn easiest in a place i never knew: right between my breasts.  annoying.  5) make sure that your undergarments (if you choose to wear them) are not crooked when you lay down to tan...  odd tan lines result... 6) the sun "don't shine" there for a reason...  cause if it gets burnt...  ouch ...  yeah.  so i actually saw a difference after the first time (and i only was in there for 8 minutes) so i think i'm going to go again.  i definitely don't want a dark tan like the girls that worked there had, but i'd like to obtain and maintain some color.  after i saw that girl at express a couple of months ago wearing the miniskirt and scaring people with her pasty white legs i decided that i cannot look like that and since my job prohibits me from being out in the sun (damn the work week...  and damn the constantly rainy weekends!) i'll have to get my color by tanning.  (because, yeah, i tried the self tanner thing, and i kind of suck it up every time and i ony do it on my legs because i shudder to think of how badly i could fuck it up on my arms/chest/face, and besides it doesn't last very long).  so now i guess i'm a high maitenance girl who tans.  ah well.  i'm a pretty, pretty princess.  i own that.

       "what, like the back of a volkswagen?"   so i (finally) went to apply for my passport during my lunch and when i went to get back in my car i looked down and noticed that right next to the door behind the driver's seat was my pack of listerine fresh strips or whatever they're called.  then i looked to my left a little and saw the side of a black box stuck between the driver's seat and the door.  i thought that it looked like a black deck of cards box that my brothers use at home.  i reached down and dug it out and discovered that this was no deck of cards...  it was a 3 pack of durex condoms.  they were "colored and scented" strawberry, orange, and (this kills me) banana.  these were not mine.  i was kind of shocked.  they must have been from the previous owner of the car.  the box was unopened (i think had it been opened it would have been gross).  immediately all i could think of was the line from mallrats, "he likes to have sex in a very uncomfortable place."  "what, like the back of a volkswagen?"  (and really, with the cloth tan seats, you'd have to use 'em or else you could stain...  ew, that was graphic, sorry...)

      to continue on with the events of the weekend...    friday i didn't end up going out.  the plan was to go out, but plans did not happen.  i ended up sitting at home waiting for half the night for said plans to happen before i aborted on that and went and hung out with  urlLink eric  and ryan.  we bummed around for a bit.  eric and ryan were planning on playing gt3 because they had 2 ps2s, 2 tvs, and eric was going to bring up his copy of gt3 and the i-link so that they could play 2 player not split screen (instead using the 2 tvs).  but eric forgot his copy of the game and also the i-link.  getting an additional copy of the game was easily solved with a trip to hollywood video.  but unfortunately another i-link was difficult to come by at 11pm on a friday night.  so eric and ryan played "my street" while i watched (was too tired to play...  had only 4 hours of sleep the night before then went to work etc).  i finally was too tired to be awake anymore so i went home (and drove off the road at one point... hit a pothole, which woke me up and scared the crap out of me but fortunately did no damage to Gus).    Saturday was cool.  went to the mall with beck.  we were going to go test drive jettas (she's eventually going to buy one), but we ran out of time.  beck had to go to a barbeque that night at her friend's house (it was his birthday) and then she convinced Alex and I to join them at a bar in Catskill.  originally they were planning on going out in Albany, but another friend suggested this bar in Catskill so the plan changed.  i was not into going to a bar in catskill when there are good bars in albany and also  urlLink hair of the dog  was playing in Saratoga.  but we went.  the bar was pretty nice.  it was all outdoors by the river and you could watch boats go by and it was a nice night, and if it had been located in saratoga or lake george it would have ruled.  but, unfortunately, it was located in catskill.  and there were like 15 people there when our group got there and then by like 1030 almost everybody left.  i guess it was bed time in booneyville.  god, i'm mean.  anyway...  so we ended up going back up to albany to the big house.  (and i didn't say i told you so.  ok, until just now.)  it ended up being a good night out.  i quite enjoyed the music at the big house and the drinks weren't bad either...  :)

      so...    Thursday was fun.  well, work wasn't.  but after work was.  we went to  urlLink "Alive at Five"  in Albany.  it was the first celtic night, and they had a band from texas,  urlLink the kildares , playing.  the band kind of sucked.  i mean, especially compared to all the awesome new york celtic bands (hello  urlLink hair of the dog ).  there were  tons  of people there.  it was at the rain location which was underneath the I-787 overpass at the Corning Preserve.  no one really knew how to get there, so you just had to follow all the other young people dragging coolers of beer.  we had our beer in a backpack because "you're supposed to drink it so fast that it doesn't get cold."  the beer i bought kind of really sucked.  see, you weren't supposed to bring glass containers, so i went for cans.  and then i thought, "ew, these can beers are ghetto" so i bought the least ghetto beer in a can, amstel light.  well, ew.  amstel light from a can pretty much just tastes like the can.  aluminum beer.  nasty.  anyway.    so we walked around till we bumped into some people that Alex used to work with at Albany Med and we ended up going to dinner with them at the  urlLink bayou cafe .  i'd never been there before.  it was a little crowded and the band they had there that night kind of sucked (i mean, they weren't terrible but...).  the food was good.  i had a veggie burrito.  it was  huge  and very spicey, but my gin and tonic took care of that.  afterwards we headed over to  urlLink mcgeary's  where the  urlLink chad lamarsh  band was playing.  they were decent.  a pretty good cover band.  the lead singer took his guitar and walked from the tent outside into the bar and then back outside again and stopped right in front of where we were standing while he was doing a Rush cover.  it was amusing.  a little uncomfortable, having the performer right there in front of you.  like, there's pressure there, having the performer right in front of you.  you really feel like you have to look like you're paying attention and like you're enjoying what they're doing.  anyway.  we only stayed there for one drink (i couldn't decide what to have so i asked the bartender to surprise me, and i got a stoli orange and tonic with a splash of grenadiene <-spelled that wrong i think.  it was pretty good.  i wonder if it has a name...).  Then we headed home.  good night out though.  :)

      went to see  Charlie's Angels Full Throttle  tonight.  Meredith's friend got free passes to a screening from his job, but he couldn't use them so Meredith invited me and Carrie and her boyfriend.  the movie was a lot of fun.  hell to get in though.  for some reason the studio set up a security check at the door to the theater, so we got there at 7 but they didn't start the movie till 830 because it took forever to get people through the security check and into the theater.  in fact, i guess they turned like 100 people away at 830 because they just wanted to start the movie.  we got in though, so that's all that matters to me.  ;)  anyway, the movie was very unrealistic but extremely entertaining.  totally makes you want to kick butt.  i wanna be an angel when i grow up.    it was so nice to sit in the air conditioned theater for three hours.  the movie was only like an hour and a half long, but i really didn't mind waiting for it to start.  i don't have a/c here at the apartment.  and i think i'm melting now that i'm back here.  i think i'm the only fool who doesn't have an air conditioner.  i really need one.  i just want a small one for my bedroom so that i can sleep at night.  this humidity is unbearable.  i think i'm going to take a cool shower before i try and go to sleep.  ugh.  this sucks.  i just checked the forecast and tomorrow is supposed to be hot and very humid again.  but starting tomorrow night we're supposed to get a break in the humidity and the temperature is supposed to drop a bit...  ugh.  i hope that happens.  it's heinous to be in my apartment in this weather.

      so sleepy...  must resolve to not only get 4 hours of sleep before going into work again...  suck...    went home to wish my little brother a happy birthday on the day of his party.  his birthday was actually on the 17th.  i hung out with my dad for a little bit, watched star trek...   then i went tanning (burnt between the girls again... dammit.  it's all red and itchy...) and then i washed my car.  i used my parents' old vaccum cleaner because it didn't cost me $1 to use it and because it has this tiny power head on it so i could really clean my floor mats.  rock.  then i used these special wipes to get all the bug carcasses off of the hood and mirrors (and later, after i drove the car in the summer night it was coated with bugs again.  yuck.)  i washed the car at the mobil across from salty's.  after i was done washing it i was drying it off when this guy pulled up in front of the bay and shouted, "you're beautiful!  i love you!"  i looked down at myself: sweaty, shorts falling off, tank top stuck to me and riding up...  i felt like i was all hanging out disgusting looking.  he apparently thought different.  i said, "thank you" and went back to drying my car.  odd.  after that i was so hot and i wanted ice cream.  the country drive in was closed (9 is too early to close!) so Alex and I went to Jumpin' Jack's.  and then drove around because the air coming through the windows and sunroof felt so nice.  later on we ended up going to Denny's where we discovered they have tiny hamburgers.  they are adorable.  they're like regular burgers cut into quarters or something.  but they look like they're own little individual tiny burgers.  adorable.  anyway.  i didn't get home until 2 and then i couldn't not at least start Harry Potter, so i didn't get to sleep 'till 3.  but i still got up on time this morning, so rock.

Carrie bought me the new Harry Potter book for my birthday.  and she gave it to me today because she knew that making me wait until my birthday for it would be cruel.  she handed it to me on the way into work this morning.  i should have just stuck it in my car right away, but i carried it inside and now it's sitting next to me on my desk.  and it's calling to me.  it's saying, "ali, read me, do it.  work is boring.  i am not."  damn the Harry Potter book.  it's arguement is just infallible.

      ok, so the plan was to get home and clean.  was gonna clean the bathroom.  was gonna clean the kitchen.  was gonna put away assloads of laundry.  was gonna clean the floors.  but what i did do was get home and throw myself on the love seat in the living room.  this is my favorite spot during the summer because the living room is shaded so it doesn't get  too  hot in there, and there are two huge windows that a very nice breeze comes in.  so the loveseat is the coolest place in the apartment in the summer.  i may end up sleeping there some nights.  perhaps i should rearrange the living room so the sofa is in that spot and i can spread out...  yeah.    so anyway.  i took a nap from about 5:15 to about 6:50.  then i made dinner (couscous) and ate.  then at about 8 i decided to watch  the ring .  i hadn't seen it yet.  everyone said it was so scary.  i didn't really think so.  ok, well, i cheated.  i watched probably about a third of the movie on mute.  yeah.  i've watched south park and the real world since then, so i'm hoping i don't have any lingering images when i go to bed.  i did do dishes.  and i might put away some laundry...    it's hot and i hate being hot.  i need an air conditioner.  i don't really have an exterior window to put one in though...  i wonder if it's ok to put one in my bedroom window if it vents into an enclosed porch...  do air conditioners emit that much exhaust?  maybe i just need to move to a place with central air...  too bad i'm poor and i really can't afford to spend any more a month than i currently am...  suck.  (whining moment:) awww!!!  hot!!!  uncomfortable!!!  dammit!!!    stupid little cat was just on the desk and falling and knocked a huge pile of papers off.  little cat is stupid and annoying.  she keeps me up at night by attacking my feet. and in the morning (and pretty much all the time) she's up in my shit.  i have to constantly watch her.  she's always getting into shit.  constanly in the garbage can.  i lit candles the other day and she kept sticking her nose in the candle.  dumbass.  i used to think i watned kids.  but i can't handle a kitten.  i can't imagine how i'd handle a kid....

      yet again, another beautiful day.  and i'm stuck inside at work.  i can't work these hours.  i need a more flexible job.  or i need to be independently wealthy.  my supervisor always tells me to marry for money.  "you can always learn to love 'em."    i am ass poor.  i hate being ass poor.  i hate working.  beh.  (sorry.  had a whining complaining moment, i'll stop now).    so i cannot wait to go home today and clean!  (not really, but i'm trying to fool myself into being excited about it).  when i came to on the bathroom floor after fainting on saturday (and after i realized where i was) all i could think was, "gross!  i'm on my bathroom floor!  i really need to clean this..."  so that's the task for the afternoon.  clean bathroom.  clean kitchen.  put away assloads of laundry.  wash floors.  of course, it's probably going to be hot and uncomfortable so i'll just end up sitting around.    i went swimming last night at dodi's house.  it was fun, but very  very  cold.  you got used to it once you got the girls in.  i had to borrow a swim suit.  all she had was a tankini.  i was like, um, no.  i don't need to be disgusting people.  and she was like, dude, it's just us.  so i tried it on, and i actually liked it.  i did not look like a huge fat ass like i thought.  and you could see the tattoo.  i think the fact that i'm getting tan is helping the whole me in a swimsuit issue that i have.  rock.  tans rock.    work does not rock.  but i better get back to it.  sigh.

      so i was fine the rest of the weekend.  i mean, healthwise.  no more fainting.  today i feel very odd.  it seems that i need to eat every 2 hours or else i get a headache.  so i ate at 10 (oatmeal) then i ate about 1230 (a lean cuisine) and now i suddenly feel weird.  the headache went away but now i feel like my face is heavy.  and i feel very weak.  i almost feel like if i tried to do anything i might faint again.  hmm.  this better stop soon.  i hate being damaged.  also, i've decided to not write about this anymore because it's boring and no one wants to read you complaining.

      i've been so bad at work today.  i haven't gotten anything done.  i suck.    had a great night last night :)  Alex and I went up to Saratoga for dinner.  we ate at this place called Baily's which was very good.  we had the saratoga salsa for an appetizer.  The salsa was very good, and it seemed homemade.  but the chips were cheapy tortilla chips...  not baked, just from a bag.  i had a grilled portabello mushroom sandwich that had feta cheese and raspberry vinagrette on it.   very  good.  there were good looking things for dessert, including do-it-yourself-at-the-table s'mores (rock!) but we didn't have anything.  i'm going to have to go back there for s'mores...  that's so cool.  afterwards we were contemplating going to see  T3 , but movies are expensive so we ended up watching  Monty Python and the Holy Grail  at my place.  i love that movie.  so yeah, good night :)    work has been so hard to get through today...  ugh.  over an hour left until the three day weekend.  let my people go.

       albany is going to hell...  shooting in my neighborhood, spider in the fruit...  albany is going to hell.  ew.  i don't want to live in albany anymore or eat the fruit.  god, that's so gross.  i can't get over that.  what if she hadn't looked?  she could have been bitten and then fallen over and the spider would have crawled out and found a spider to mate with and produce horrible little mutant killing spiders like in  arachnaphobia .     EW!!!!    meredith just told me that there was an  egg sack  in the grapes as well.  horrible.  just freaking too disgustingly horrible to think about.  what if she'd reached down and grabbed the egg sack instead of a grape and  ate that?!   i'm so skeeved out...  ew....   ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew...

       spider in the fruit...  oh.  my.  god.  i am  never  buying desert fresh grapes.  or really, any grapes.  ew ew ew ew ew.  some woman bought a bunch of grapes at the BJ's wholesale club in albany and she brought them to work for coworkers to eat and when she opened the container she found a  black widow spider  in it.   EW!!   ugh.   urlLink here's an article about it .  ohmygod.  i would  die  if i looked into my container of grapes and saw a black widow in it.  i think i'd fall over.  or throw the container.  which is heinous because the spider would definitely get out.  and then try to eat me.

       shooting in my neigborhood...  so yesterday i went to my parents' house after work.  the six o'clock news came on and their lead story was that of a shooting in an otherwise quiet albany neighborhood.  the shot behind the news correspondent looked familiar and i said, "that better not be my neighborhood" and then the correspondent said that the shooting occurred in the Pine Hills neighborhood of Albany and i said, "that is my neighborhood."  apparently yesterday at 5:30 in the morning this guy was getting home from work and was parked on New Scotland Ave near Norwood Street (the next street over from my street) when two men approached his car and asked for a cigarette.   they may or may not have struggled after that and the man got shot in the chest.  the two attackers took his wallet and his car and left the guy on the street.  the guy crawled out to the street and waved down a passing ambulance (there are many, many ambulances on New Scotland all the time because St Peter's is on one end and Albany Med is on the other) who took the guy to Albany Med.  I guess he survived.  This is very freaky though.  shootings in your neighborhood are not good.  scary.  and my lease is up at the end of this month and i just got the new one to renew it...  i was thinking of moving before the shooting and i started thinking of it again after i heard about that, but i really don't think i'd be able to get my ass in gear and find a new place for about the same amount of money that would allow me to move in at the beginning of August...  so beh.  you can read the  urlLink times union  article about the shooting  urlLink here .

      so again i was working at a good pace getting a lot of stuff done today when suddenly my concentration left me and i couldn't do a thing.  so i decided to see who was playing at  urlLink mcgeary's  this week.  and on the 4th there's this band called  urlLink enter the haggis  playing.  rock that name.  they're a celtic rock band, which really sounds interesting.  they have pipes and everything.  and from the  urlLink pictures  on their site they look like they put on a fun show.  they have sound clips on their site but as i am at work and do not have speakers on my computer i cannot listen to them.  they have a pretty cool site altogether.  i  really  enjoy the format of their  urlLink picture page .  i'd love to do something like that for my photo album...  that's something to think about...  anyway.  so yeah, that band looks great and it looks like it'd be a fun time but i don't think i'll be going because i have no plans for the 4th and i don't think i'll be able to get anyone to come.  >:-(

      went shopping today with michelle.  had a good time, and was hella proud of myself for not buying anything.  after i dropped her off i did purchase one thing: i went to linens and things and got these ice cube tray bottle things.  you don't spill when you take them from the sink to the freezer, and once the things are frozen it doesn't matter what why you stick them in the freezer.  this is a bonus for me as my freezer is always packed and i have no convenient shelf to stick the ice cube trays.  i found blinds on my porch.  since i've moved in here, i haven't been able to look at my porch without being dissatisfied.  there were pull down shades on the windows, but that looked just so hella ghetto to me.  i wanted matchstick blinds for it, because you could leave them pulled down and get privacy but they'd let the breeze through.  matchstick blinds, while relatively cheap are too hella expensive for this ghetto girl.  so i never purchased them.  well, this evening i wanted to sit out on my porch and read (starting the harry potter series all over again) and i was irritated that i wasn't getting a cross breeze from the front of the building.  i used to have a screen in the window that faced the front of the building, but it fell out one day and i stuck it in the storage closet on my porch because the little cat was clawing at it.  i went to retrieve the screen from the closet today and i noticed that something else was in that closet as well: blinds.  i dug out a few sets that were all wrapped up on each other and discovered that they were those cheap paper (felt?) blinds that filter in light.  on each end of the top of the blind was a hole  i looked up at the windows on my porch and there were nails on each side underneath where the pull down shades hung.  so i hung up the blinds.  they're hella dirty, so i'm going to have to figure out how you clean them, but i like them much better than the pull down shades.  now what i need for my porch is some sort of shade for the bulb on the ceiling and i'd love a little bistro set (even if it was one of those plastic ones) because dining on my porch would just be too cool.  i should probably get some plants as well.  i have a big old hook out there for a hanging plant.  i should get one.  but really, there's probably no point to me getting a plant because i'll probably just kill it...    so anyway...  the blinds still look kind of ghetto to me compared to my vision of matchstick blinds, but hey, they're free.  i think i have a porch inferiorty complex because the woman right behind me has such a pretty porch.  she has a topiary on the windowsill (that looks just so... nice.  not frilly/frumpy) and she's got a scarf draped across the top of all of the porch windows.  her porch doesn't look right out onto someone's deck, so she doesn't need the privacy that i do, but i can't help but be all jealous of her nice porch.  i have to keep reminding myself that she's in her thirties and has been living on her own much longer than i have and that's why her apartment is so grown up and pretty looking.  my apartment will someday be grown up and pretty looking as well.... hopefully...

      this morning i saw two out of the ordinary things on the road.  i thought this meant that today was going to be weird for me.  thus far, that has not proved to be true, unless you count the fact that i've been pretty productive today so far as being odd.  i guess it is actually pretty weird that i've been productive.  oh!  and it's really weird that i was the first person here in my department despite having gotten up late and missing my exit on the northway because i was too distracted by the out of the ordinary things i'd witnessed.  anyway.  so weird day.  so the first out of the ordinary thing that i saw today (God, people should just ph34r my 1337 writing ski11z) was an SUV flying through the air flipping over.  it was actually pretty scary.  i was on I-90 West bound in the left lane preparing to shoot over across the middle lane and the right lane to exit onto the Northway when a few carlengths up from me in the left lane of the East bound side a white SUV (I dunno, possibly a Jeep or a Ford) suddenly struck the stone barrier between the two sides with his driver's side front corner.  He was going at such a speed that he launched up the barrier and flew into the air while flipping over and then landed in the left lane causing the cars behind him to smash into him.  it was so freaking scary.  the sound of the metal scraping against the concrete was horrible.  i wanted to cry.  i picked up my cellphone and dialed 911 to report it.  first time i've ever called 911.  then i felt bad because here this person might have died and i saw it and the only thing i could do was report the accident and then go to work.  but seeing that accident occur was pretty surreal.  it looked like a scene from a movie.  specifically, i immediately thought of the previews for  Bad Boys II .  really freaked me out, and i didn't speed (as much) the rest of the way to work.   so then i was on the northway, still on my way to work, when i saw the second out of the ordinary thing today.  i was in the middle lane (for a change), doing about 80 or so, when suddenly there was this loud noise next to me in the left lane.  i looked to my left to see a motorcycle flying by me on one wheel.  who does that?!  i mean, this guy was on the Norway, doing at least 90 mph on  a motorcycle, isn't that dangerous enough for him?  why did he feel the need to do a wheelie as he flew by me? i guess on any other day i wouldn't have been as freaked out about that as i was, but having just witnessed a horrible accident i thought this guy was really taking an unnecessary risk.  i almost rolled down my window to yell at him to be careful.    anyway.  so yeah.  weird day.  i hope no one died in that accident this morning.

      so alex and i tried to go see  pirates of the caribbean  last night.  the listing on  urlLink timesunion.com  said that there was a 10:30 show.  we showed up at 10:30, but there was no show.  annoying.  and i was all excited to see orlando bloom ;)  we ended up going to Denny's where we saw some heinous looking cars in the parking lot.  one was a large metallic kermit the frog green boat of a car from the 70s and parked right next to it was a blue car (a honda, i think) that had a carbon fiber hood put on it and a huge spoiler on the back along with many other aftermarket parts.  i thought it just looked stupid.  we went back to my apartment afterwards and just bummed around and watched TV, which was very cool. :) i'm glad that bumming around and watching TV is enjoyable, because it's just about all i can afford to do nowadays.    but i ask you: why is it that cats never need to use the litter box until there are people sitting in the room where the litter box is located?  my cats were grossing me out so bad last night.  i'm moving their litter boxes out to the porch tonight.  it's been so nice lately that i've been leaving the kitchen door open so that the cats can go out onto the porch during the day anyway, so i might as well put the litter boxes out there for the summer.  if only i could put a cat door on the kitchen door... then i could leave them out there year round.

      ugh.  i fucking got sick again yesterday.  my eyes were  killing  me.  my left eye was worse than my right, but they were both red and really,  really  sensitive to light.  suck.  my sinuses were all stuffed also and i could barely open my left eye.  i drove to work in the morning, but drove off the road at one point because i couldn't see.  my eyes hurt  so bad  and they were watering and out of focus.  suck.  so i got to work and it wasn't  too  bad in the office, except for when light was reflecting off of my computer screen or papers or something.  i made a dr appointment pretty much right away and had to call my mom to come drive me there because i couldn't drive.  my dr (well, the NP, but close enough) rx'd me some antibiotics and told me to lie down with cold compresses on my eyes and to call her tomorrow (today) if the eyes weren't getting any better.  it's not pink eye.  actually, it hurts worse than pink eye.  but it's good that i don't have that nasty infectious disease (again).  i ended up going to my parents' house afterwards to lay down for the afternoon.  i slept for 3 hours that afternoon.  i know that i'm sick when i sleep.  and i slept.  the night before when the eye started hurting i slept for 2 hours after work and then went to bed early.  and then yesterday i slept in the afternoon and went to bed by 10.  ugh.  i normally sleep at the most 8 hours a night and that's it.  anyway.  i'm feeling much better today.  my eyes still aren't all the way back to normal yet but they're much better than they were yesterday.  i hate being sick.  i've been sick so much in the past six months or so.  much more than i usually am.  i hope i'm back to normal by my birthday....

      three day weekends rule.  every weekend should be a three day weekend.  it was so nice to just spend days relaxing and then still have time to do fun things.    friday i started my 4th of july by cleaning.  i cleaned from 9:30am until 1pm.  my apartment is so clean, it rules!  i hope i can keep it that way...  after my cleaning marathon i showered and headed up to my parents' house where i veg-ed out for a bit and then ate steak (rock!).  mom made this brocolli salad that was hella good.  the parents and the boys went to the fireworks in clifton park.  i went with Carrie and John and Amy and Mike and Beth and Matt to the fireworks in Albany.  they  rocked .  the finale was so freaking awesome.  one firework after another after another...  so cool.  the theme of the show sucked though.  i mean, who comes up with this crap?  it was "peace love and something."  i don't remember what the something was.  but yeah.  i mean, it was such a hippy love in show.  they should have just handed out the pot.  but the song selection didn't always fit the hippy theme, one of the songs was "ain't no mountain high enough" which reminded us of  bridget jonse's diary  so afterwards we went back to Carrie's apartment (where there's central air) to watch that movie.    saturday was a quiet day for the most part.  i got up and exercised for about an hour (rock!) then took a long bath and had a "spa day."  Alex called around 7 and I met him and Steve at the marina in clifton park.  they were borrowing shawn brimhall's boat.  we went on a short ride on the mohawk.  it was such a nice, relaxing ride.  the temperature was perfect: warm, but when we were "speeding" along the breeze felt great.  we watched some fireworks that people were setting off along the river, but it was ass buggy so we cut the ride short.    sunday was also a quiet day.  i spent most of the day watching tv and napping.  wow, i lead a hard life.  yeah.  i went up to the parents' house for a while and to the country drive in with my sister and two of my little brothers.  the little guy got ice cream all over him.  we made him fold his hands and not touch anything in my car on the way home...  later on i saw  t3  with alex.  i enjoyed the movie.  it was loud and fun.  and that's all i wanted it to be.  there were some funny scenes... but overall just a lot of explosions and fight scenes.  i was way into it for some reason, i kept getting all nervous for the characters and jumping when there were suspensful parts.    so yeah.  three day weekends rule.  the only suckass thing about them is you get used to being lazy and getting back to work is more difficult than normal on a monday...

      so i went to look for my birthday horoscope online.  i used to always look at the birthday horoscope in the times union.  it felt so special to read it on your birthday because there's only one day a year that you can read the birthday horoscope and have it apply to you.  i don't get the times union now that i don't live at home and they didn't have their horoscopes  urlLink on their site  (or at least they weren't easily found).  so i did a google search for "horoscope birthday" and i found the  urlLink New York Post horoscope  for my birthday.  Here it is:    Your Horoscope for July 17, 2003  IF THURSDAY, JULY 17TH IS YOUR BIRTHDAY   You will be incredibly impulsive this year: You will come and go at the drop of a hat and you will change direction, both in your personal life and in your career, without hesitation. Travel of all kinds is especially well starred, and the further away your adventures take you, the more you will get out of them. You may decide not to come back.  so how exciting is that?  i  have  become incredibly impulsive in the last year, so i can definitely see that first part applying to me.  and i am travelling to Ireland in August, which is the furthest i've ever travelled.  how exciting!  what if i never come back?  that would certainly be a change in my personal life and career...    so now i'm all excited for my 24th year.

       they say it's my birthday   so that's cool :)  i'm 24.  definitely mid-twenties.  that sucks.  i'm not a kid anymore.  that must make my parents feel old.    Dodi came over last night and we made cookies.  I wanted to make myself a birthday cake but apparently that's a pathetic thing to do and Meredith had told me not to do that when I mentioned it at work earlier.  my coworkers decorated my cubicle for me today.  rock.  everyone should know it's my birthday and do nice things for me ;)  i'm very excited to go out tonight and see hair of the dog.  it's hard to concentrate here at work.  people should be excused from working on their birthday.

      sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet emoooooooooooooooooooooooootion.  i'm listening to that song here at work.  rock.  so this weekend was pretty good.  saw  Pirates of the Caribbean  on friday night.  i loved that movie.  first of all, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are extremely hot.  and Johnny Depp was very entertaining as the flamboyant and crazy Captain Jack Sparrow.  and there were these little references in the movie to the ride at Disney World it was based on.  like, there was a scene where prisoners were trying to tempt a dog that was holding the keys to the cell in his mouth with a bone.  so right out of the ride.  very cool.  anyway, i'm going to have to own that movie when it comes out on DVD.  Saturday I went to Sam's Club with my parents.  they bought me shampoo and conditioner and contact solution.  which rocks.  i could have used some food as well, but when they asked me if i needed anything i felt very odd about asking for anything and they really had to keep at me to get me to ask for the shampoo and the contact stuff.  getting those for me really helps though, because they're expensive items to buy.  Later on I went with Beck to see  Chicago  (the movie) at Proctor's Theater.  We were supposed to meet Carrie and John and Jen Peters, but we got there late and the movie had already started so we just found seats.  It was awesome seeing a movie at Proctors.  It felt like you were seeing a real show.  And because it was a musical i wanted to clap after every number.  And to top it all off, it was cheap: $2 to sit orchestra level and $3 for the balcony.  Afterwards we met with Carrie, John, and Jen and went to Uno's for dessert/drinks.  I  needed  the peanut butter cup dessert they have there.  it is so good.    Sunday I went to lunch with the lunch crew at Macaroni Grill.  It was my birthday lunch and they brought me gifts and bought my lunch.  rock!  i made my own pasta dish (an option there) and it was fabulous: penne pasta with asiago cheese sauce and roasted garlic cloves, artichoke hearts and mushrooms topped with grilled shrimp.   so  good.  Carrie and Amy gave me a gift certificate to Victoria's Secret and these awesome martini glasses that they have at Uno's (and that i was just admiring the night before) that have cobalt blue stems that twist.  Joanne and John gave me a $50 gift cerficate to Bath and Body Works which I promptly speant that afternoon.  it was so cool.  Beck and I went to the mall right afterwards and the girls at Bath and Body Works said they had coupons there that they couldn't use: for $50 off of $100.  so i got $100 worth of stuff and all i had to pay was $6 for tax.   so  cool.  i got the complete line of a new "flavor" that smells like gin and tonics (well, it's coconut line verbena).  it's awesome.  and i got a bunch of candles and i got my mom's birthday gift (her birthday is today).  rock.  it was the coolest thing ever.  later on I went with Alex to see  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen .  it was not so good.  very disappointing.  suck.  it was cool to hear Sean Connery say "That was naughty" but you can hear that on the previews so save your money.

      so i've been playing with my new toy tonight (the digital cable) and i started watching the  urlLink discovery health  channel.  this channel is always on in the waiting room of my doctor's office.  i thought it would be incredibly dull, but the program that i'm watching is very interesting.  it's called  urlLink berman & berman  and it's a talk show about women's (sexual) health issues run by two sisters (one is a sex therapist and the other is a urologist).  i really like the way that the sisters run their show.  it's not very smooth or whatever, but they're very frank.  when they talk about specific topics it does seem like they're doing more of a presentation than a talk show, but then they start discussing the facts they just presented and it's back to the talk show format again.    their topic tonight is virginity.  they had a "secondary virgin" on who talked about how she was into "drugs and rock and roll" when she was in her teens and twenties and that she dressed "like a hoochie-mama" (I can't believe she actually used that term, i was embarrassed for her) but that one day she felt an emptiness inside her so she went to church and decided to be celibate.  ok.  good for her.  whatever.  but then she started talking about how sex is dirty and that she wants to save herself for her wedding day and wear the white dress because she wants her husband to know that she waited her whole life for him blah blah blah and i'm thinking, well honey, you already blew that.  i'm sorry, but deciding to not have sex until you're married after you've already had sex (and lots of it from what she was saying) does not make you a virgin.  it makes you a wannabe.  and it certainly does not mean that you can tell your husband you've waited your whole life for him.    then they had this other woman on who was a 35 year old "true" virgin.  she's in a relationship right now where they don't even kiss.  she thinks they're heading towards marriage and expects to be married by the end of the year.  she seemed pretty relaxed about the whole thing.  she wasn't saying that sex was dirty or whatever.  and she said that she's accepting and warm towards people who don't share her beliefs, that it's a personal choice.  but when one of the sisters asked her what if her husband sucks she pretty much responded that she wouldn't know the difference and that he'd be able to teach her about sex (he's a "secondary" virgin) and they'd have the rest of their lives to get it right.  uh huh.  i feel bad for her.  she's waited for 35 years.  can you imagine that pressure on her wedding night?  and she won't even masterbate because she feels that it's witholding something from her husband.  wow.    one of the audience members spoke up and said that she was 35 years old and a virgin on her wedding night and she claims that she is blessed and has a wonderful sex life.  i don't really believe her.  i mean, how would she really know?  she said that one of the best things for her about waiting is that her husband feels very special because "he's the only one for [her]."  right.    the thing that's really disturbing to me about these women is that one of the major reasons they are virgins is to make their husbands feel special.  whatever.  that's really heinous to me.  i mean, these women don't require that their husbands be virgins when they marry them.  both 35 year olds were partnered with men who had already had sex (and the secondary virgin wasn't dating so i don't know whether she expected her husband to be and also she's desperate and hasn't dated since she's turned celibate and also she's a faker so i don't count her). what a freaking double standard that is!  i mean, they want their men to feel special because they're the only guys they've been with, but they don't expect the same from their men?  it seems to me that waiting until your wedding night is supporting a view of women that places them in a servientile role to their husbands.  and that's incredibly offensive to me.    i agree that most kids (let's not limit it to girls) have sex way before they are emotionally ready to handle it, but i don't think that means they should wait until they're married.  i think they should wait until they're ready.  of course, that leads to the question, "how do you know when you're ready?"  and i don't really have an answer for that.  i guess it's different for everyone.  i was 18 when i first had sex and thinking back on it i was really such a stupid young kid.  but i don't think it was too soon.  i think i was ready.  i was in college and with a guy that i was in love with at the time and that i wasn't doing it for him (to keep him with me or something like that), i was doing it for me.  i guess that's how i knew i was ready.  i think that when you have that experience of being that intimate with someone else it can mature you.  so someone who never experiences that is lacking a maturity in that arena and doesn't seem to be fully an adult to me.  how can you make adult decisions about the rest of your life (marriage) when you still have a childlike view on some things?    people need to own their sexuality.  it's not something to be ashamed of or something that should be saved or surrendered to another person.    anyway.  interesting show.  love the digital cable.

      digital cable rules.  Episode II was on one of the many  urlLink HBO  channels and the picture was actually awesome.  i didn't really expect the picture to look much different, but it really looked great.  it looked like i was playing a DVD.  I didn't realize that when you get HBO you get all the HBO channels so I have like 7 channels of HBO.  rock!  I was looking through all of the new channels i get now last night and i discovered  urlLink Boomerang  from  urlLink cartoon network .  they play all the classic/old cartoons on there.  rock.  i am very happy about that.  i love old cartoons.  and the guide function of digital cable is freaking awesome.  it makes it worth the extra money right there.    so alex and i watched Episode II and then The Three Musketeers while we ate the awesome dinner I made.  I made this chicken couscous dish that rocked.  it had garlic and feta cheese and broccoli and tomotoes.  it was so good. alex tried to show me how to work my new cable.  after he left i watched a current episode of sex and the city.  i was so excited to be seeing an episode from this season.  i'm so excited that i can see the final episode when it plays instead of waiting for the dvd.  i'm getting better at the remote, but i wasn't as quick with it as alex was when i first started playing with it.  but yeah, i'm very happy with my new toy :)

      i'm getting digital cable today.  i'm so hella excited.  i was randomly sitting around sunday night and i started checking the prices on digital cable.  it turns out that with their one package (which actually, i guess they're not going to offer anymore because i just got a flyer with new prices the day after i ordered it so i got in just in time) i get digital cable plus one "premier" channel (i picked  urlLink hbo ) and road runner for $98 a month.  after taxes that's only $15 more than i pay now and i get HBO plus all the extra digital cable channels (and i'm kind of excited about BBCAmerica) so i figured i'd go for it.  The cable guy should be coming any minute now.  Alex is going to meet him for me.  my sister was going to do it for me, but she would have had to bring our little brother down with her to wait for the cable guy because she's watching him for mom this afternoon and i didn't want to have the little guy have to hang out in my apartment all afternoon.  that would have sucked for him.  so i asked alex and he's doing it for me.  he fixed my setup with my dvd player/playstation/stereo.  i couldn't get the dvd player to work before but he says it's working now.  so that rules :)  i can't wait to be able to watch HBO tonight :)  i'm going to cook dinner too.  rock. dinner and good tv.

      so the birthday was a good time.    work finally ended.  it wasn't a bad day at work.  i went to lunch with Carrie and Meredith at Bennigan's (had the Turkey O'Toole) and they treated because it was my birthday.  then when we got back to the office Meredith surprised me with a homemade chocolate cake that was very rich and  very  good.  the whole family came to the apartment after work and brought me dinner and cake.  very nice.  mom made chicken continental, which is like my favorite ever, so that ruled.  i ate (too much).  the family didn't stay too long.  i think my apartment's too small to have that many people in it at once...    Meredith came over to pick me up to go to McGeary's and Dodi and Tristan dropped by to give me my birthday gift and then Beck and Kevin and Kevin's roommate, Dave, dropped by on the way there as well.  Dodi gave me the cutest gift ever: the bag was too adorable (pink!) and she stuffed it with a butterfly notepad and matching pen and some glittery lip stuff and a gift certificate to borders.  Beck gave me these two very cute  urlLink dancing hamsters :  urlLink Hamzilla  is dressed like Godzilla and it plays "Godzilla" and its eyes light up and Mona is dressed like a lounge singer and she sings "Respect" (and it's so freaking cute because she like screams at one part).  Beck also gave me this  really  pretty butterfly frame that's beaded and intricate.  i don't have a picture i like enough to put in there yet, but i'm hoping that i'll have one from europe (one month from today we leave!!!!).    McGeary's was  packed .  Hair of the Dog was excellent as usual.  I unfortunately could not seem to get drunk (damn the big meal and the filling guinness!).  but i had a good time nontheless.    I spent Friday morning relaxing and watching morning TV that I never get to watch (Price is Right) and then i hung out with the sistah for a while.  we went to the mall (and i could not seem to spend money, even though i tried) and then watched  fear and loathing in las vegas  which i just remembered i have to return tonight.  i hung out with beck later.  we walked to Dunkin' Donuts and ate breakfast sandwhiches and then walked back to my apartment where we beached ourselves on the sofas and watched TV.    Saturday was quiet for most of the day as well.  I went mini-golfing with Beck and Kevin that night.  we almost didn't leave the house because " urlLink most extreme elimination challange " was on  urlLink spikeTV  and it was just  too  freaking funny.  but we drug ourselves away from the TV to go mini-golfing and it was a good time.  we went to this place by  urlLink Hudson Valley  that was very cool called  urlLink oasis park .  i tied with Kevin (58) to beat Beck (67).  then we went to Andy's down the street from me for a couple of beers.    Sunday I met Amy, Joann, and John for lunch at Friday's (had the vegetable grill - excellent) and afterwards we went to the Saratoga County Fair along with Carrie and John.  I brought my youngest brother, Alex, along and we had a fun time.  I took some pictures which I'll hopefully post soon.  Xander really liked this huge model train.  he kept wanting to go back and look at it.  he's so cute.  i put him on some rides: the wild worm (a small roller coaster type ride), the big swings, and the music express thing.  i went on that last one with him because he's small and i couldn't imagine putting him on that ride alone.  and it was fun.  they were playing crappy new music before i got on, but when i got on they played Aerosmith and that ruled.  i was getting tired and cranky so after we ate some fair junk food we headed home.    so it was a nice birthday weekend.

      less than a month until the trip to ireland.  and today i finally got around to figuring out how beck and i will get to/from the airport.  we'll take the train from poughkeepsie to grand central and then get on a shuttle from grand central to jfk.  the shuttle is run by  urlLink new york airport service  and it costs $22 round trip.  we could actually get a free bus shuttle from the howard beach stop of the A train, but i'm thinking that taking a shuttle right from grand central will be much easier than taking the subway to a bus because we'll have our luggage with us and carting that crap around is going to be annoying.  i'm hoping to pack very light, but knowing me i'll cram my whole wardrobe into one of my huge suitcases and still hate everything i brought with me when i'm over there.  my dad goes to saudi arabia for a month with just one of those carryon size suitcases on wheels.  i should ask him for advice...  anyway.  still much planning to do but i feel like a hero for getting that little bit done so that's all i'm going to worry about right now...  think we're going to saratoga tonight. beck said that alex and steve and foster were going to be up there and we'll probably head up there and meet them.  the only thing about beck having a new car is now both of us want to drive our cars.  i think i'll let her drive tonight.  her car is less than a week old, she should get to show it off as much as possible.  thing is, i just freaking love my little beetle so much, i always want to drive it.  i just saw a commercial for the beetle (for the promotion where you get an ipod free when you buy a new one) and i wanted to go out and hug my car.  i actually clapped at the commercial (lame.  that is so entirely lame.  i can't believe i just admitted that to the world).  and my little car is just too awesome to go up to saratoga in because it's so girly and cute!  sigh.  ah well.  i'll drive some other time...  :(    i just watched  urlLink queer eye for the straight guy  on bravo.  that show is awesome.  the episode i watched showed  urlLink this guy  getting all pretty and then he proposed to his girlfriend at the end.  it was a beautiful proposal.  actually very exciting television.  the gay guys instructed the guy throughout the episode on how to dress, act, decorate, cook etc and then they helped him set up the proposal night.  then they left and watched the video of the night and kind of critiqued him and at the end when he was proposing they were all holding hands and so nervous/excited for him.  it was so cute!  you totally kind of fall in love with the straight guy while you watched the show because it's so freaking sweet that he's doing all this for his girlfriend/wife/whatever.  anyway.  good show.

      so friday night i went out with  urlLink dodi  and jess.  we had a "girls night" in Saratoga.  it was a great night to be up in Saratoga: the night was beautiful and there was some sort of festival thing going on called "hats off to saratoga" and they'd shut down Caroline street and had a band playing in the street.  we started out at  urlLink the parting glass .  they've ruined my favorite saratoga bar.  they put freaking fake tile down in the performance area and the dart room.  it looks so completely lame.  it does not belong in a pub.  it's light gray.  it almost looks like it's trying to be marble.  i hate it.  it looks like a big bathroom now.  and they took out the glass case from the dart room and put a juke box in there.  stupid.  we left after one drink because it was too painful to be in there.  anyway.  it was a good night.  Jess rapped for us on the way back to clifton park, which was hella funny.  she kind of has this monotone voice and she was doing Nelly's part in "Shake Your Tailfeather" and it was hilarious.    so saturday i was surprised by eric.  he randomly came up for the weekend, i guess because Sarah was going to the ballet with his mom.  so he had saturday afternoon free and we hung out just like we used to when we both lived at home.  we went to  urlLink the only guitar shop  where eric bought a used distortion pedal for his electric guitar that he's trying to start playing.  then we hung out at  urlLink compusa  for a little while.  eric bought one of those rubber keyboards so that he wouldn't disturb sarah at night when he was up late on the computer with loud key clacking.  at the register the girl offered him a one year warranty on it.  eric noted that having someone offer you a warranty on something that says indestructible right on the box kind of cheapens the whole experience.  we went to  urlLink clifton park center (the dirt mall)  to go to radio shack and we ended up playing  urlLink ddr  for a little bit.  it was awesome :)  i haven't played in so long and it was great to play with someone who was (almost) as excited as I was about playing it.  we parted ways after the ddr and i came back to my apartment to install a new  urlLink showerhead  all by myself.  it doesn't leak (much).  so then i took a nice long shower and an even longer bath (in which i used this awesome salt scrub from bath and body works that is  amazing ).  i watched  say anything  on  urlLink hbo  and Alex came over just before the end of it.  we bummed around the rest of the night: rented  bad boys  because i'd never seen the original one and we were planning on going the next night to see the sequal and had awesome chinease food from this place on madison ave, china wok, that was actually very clean on the inside.  i have to remember to always order from there because it was freaking the best chinease food ever.  i didn't get to see the end of  bad boys  that night because i passed out on the sofa (damn chinease food).    the next morning i made breakfast because i actually had bacon and eggs and that doesn't happen all the time.  my breakfast ruled.  i was a lazy bum and sat on my ass all sunday watching movies.  i rewatched  bad boys  so that i could see the end of it and then my sister came over and we watched  almost famous  which i rented entirely because i like the song, "tiny dancer".  i ended up loving that movie.  beck and kevin dropped by about a half hour before it was over to pick up  supertroopers .  i guess kevin hadn't ever seen it (!) and beck loaned her copy to her friend, Amy, and she didn't get it back yet so she had to borrow mine.  it's weird how you never want to watch a movie until someone asks you to borrow it.  i handed it over to them and i suddenly felt the need to watch it like you wouldn't believe so beck promised me that i'd have it back by the weekend.  after the movie my sister drove me up to my parents house where we ate pizza and hassled my brother who just got back from a boy scout canoeing trip.  the pizza was Mama's pizza, which i hate, and i tried to make it better by reheating it in the oven instead of the microwave in the hopes that the crispiness would overpower the general suckiness of the pizza but my effort was to no avail.  it still sucked.  alex picked me up and we saw  bad boys II .  it was a pretty decent movie, but a little on the longish side and the end was just completely unbelievable.  there were some really great scenes in it though that were  hilarious  especially the scene where they're in the electronics store.  funny shit.    overall it was a groovy weekend.  (that word needs to be used more.  use it.)    it's too bad i can't really say the same for monday.  monday kind of blew at work.  after work was cool: i got lots of new stuff from  urlLink victoria's secret  for ass cheap because i had a gift certificate and two coupons.  i got a bra and six pairs of panties (i  detest  that word, it makes my skin crawl, but underwear just sounds so clunky) for 98 cents.  i rule.  then beck and kevin dropped by to show me beck's new car.  it's a 2001  urlLink Jetta Wolfsburg  edition.  and it's  very  cute.  she's so excited about it :)  here are some pictures:     urlLink      urlLink     they took me for a spin and beck is funny getting used to the turbo engine: she kept speeding through yellow/red lights.  she's all worried that she's going to get another ticket now :)  now we have matching  urlLink VW  flippy keys.  i told her that our cars were going to have to go on play dates to get washed together and that i was going to teach her how to wash her car correctly.  i think it's very important that people keep their cars clean (at least as long as you're making payments on it) because how can you be excited about a dirty car?  after they left i headed up to clifton park to pick up dodi and go to the country drive-in for dinner.  country drive in onion rings  rule .  beck and kevin met us there for ice cream and we hung out for a bit until the mosquitoes bit too much.  i took dodi home and swung by target where i picked up an extraordinarily cute and cheap pair of "house shoes".  they're flip flops with a white terry cloth top and a "bamboo" bottom.  they were on clearance for $4.  i needed "house shoes" because it's too hot to wear slippers and my floors are never clean enough for me to go barefoot.  also they are very comfortable.  yeah.  so.  time to stop writing.  it's time to make myself go to sleep.  i must get up on time tomorrow.  i must not get up late again...

      so hot...  hate humidity...  must have air conditioner in next apartment.  i  hate  humidity!!  there's a reason why i don't live in florida.  even if i got an air conditioner i'd only put it in my bedroom so it'd be nice to sleep at night and also because i wouldn't want the a/c unit hanging out my living room window because it's in the front of the apartment building and that would look  so  ghetto.  so yeah.  next apartment will have: air conditioning and a dishwasher.  as a bonus it could have a washer/dryer.  sigh.  but i've got at least another year here.    last night was the summer outing for work.  we went on a "sunset cruise" on  urlLink dutch apple cruises .  the food was alright.  i mean, the cubed cheese was good.  and the vegetable platter was pretty good.  the "party subs" were alright.  but the zita and meatballs had a pretty gross generic cafeteria food sauce and the crabcakes tasted like they were made with stovetop stuffing and they were warm to cold and the wings were... well i liked them but they must've been pretty sucky wings if i liked them because i hate what is "good" about wings.  they weren't too greasy and they didn't have much taste other than just chicken.  there were three decks to the boat and the middle deck had the bar and a big fat dj but they kicked all mercury people out of the middle section (they actually made an announcement).  we were banished to the lowest deck (which was pretty much a cafeteria) but everyone kind of migrated to the uppermost deck.  it was mostly open up there with the middle section covered by an awning and even though it was raining the entire time we were on the boat (seriously, it started when we were leaving the dock and ended when we were pulling back in) it was pretty nice up there.  the cruise was 2 hours long, which i thought was going to feel like a lifetime, but it went by pretty quickly.   (hot.  melting.  hate humidity.)    so today i decided that i'd just veg at home after work.  and that ruled.  i got shit done.  rock!  i exercised (so hot...) and then i made a kickass dinner of veggies grilled on my george foreman grill and tossed with balsamic vinegar and thin spaghetti.  it ruled.  and i have leftovers for work tomorrow.  i rule.  i did dishes (damn, i'm productive) and cleaned the cat litter (i hate doing that.  so very much.).  i'm hoping to figure out what i'm wearing to work tomorrow, pay bills, and plan tomorrow night's dinner before i go to bed.  doable.  if i don't lose my motivation.  (hot.  so hot.)    i can't believe tomorrow's only thursday.

      well, there's 18 days left until beck and i leave for europe and i am utterly unprepared and freaking out.  why do i think i can afford to go on this trip when my finances are so shitty?  i have  absolutely  no money for this trip and i had to ask my mom if i could have a loan.  and of course she's not going to hand over any money without a large guilt trip attatched to it.  and that's hella shitty because i really have a hard time asking anyone for help at all for anything.  and i especially have a hard time asking for monetary help.  so i ask her and she's got to make it difficult for me.  she wanted to know what i was paying for: in other words, was i making beck pay any more for the hotels because i got the tickets.  i think that was pretty shitty of her.  i mean, i didn't buy the tickets, they were a gift.  and i asked beck to come on a trip with me.  you don't say, "hey, i got free tickets to anywhere in the world, do you want to come?  but you need to pay for the hotels because the tickets are mine."  that's shitty. then she wanted to know if anyone else was giving me money: in other words is dad giving me money.  well he gave me the tickets.  and also, i'm one of six kids that he provides for.  she only has me.  and she doesn't provide for me.  so i think she can handle it better than he can.  whatever.  she wants me to come up with a number to ask her for.  but then she got all preachy about how i should really go cheap blah blah blah.  no fucking kidding.  i mean, i go cheap every day of my life, why would i think i should/could blow a lot of money on vacation.  at the same time, this could be my only trip to europe.  this woman travels all the time (at the same time that i'll be in ireland she'll be on an alaskan cruise) and they spare no expense.  and never ask me along.  you'd think that she'd want to give me a little extra so that i could have a good time on my first real travel experience.  whatever.  it sounds like she's going to loan me money, but it's going to be pulling teeth getting anything out of her.  i'm so scared for this trip.  i don't want to be over there and be out of money.  i want to at least be able to eat every day.  ugh.  stressing.  i'm so stressed out over this trip, over the money that i'm going to be spending that it almost makes me wish i wasn't going.  i hate being so fucking poor.  seriously, i'm so depressed that everything i had saved up for this trip is basically gone.  i don't know how that happened either.  i've had so many unexpected expenses over the last 3 months or so.  and what's frustrating is i've been living very ghetto so that i could save up for this trip and i've got nothing to show for it.  ugh. stressed/depressed.    i should stop worrying about it.  looks like mom will loan me money.  as long as i have enough for hotels and at least one meal a day and transportation to/from airports i'll be ok.  it'll be a ghetto fabulous trip to europe.  i should just relax and enjoy it.

      i am a  very  lucky girl.  i got home from work and i had power.  awesome.    at about 4:25 or so the power dimmed and then went off at work.  blow.  at first we thought it was a local thing (hell, our freaking network was down all day, we figured sure, the power could be next) but then everyone started calling their families and we realized it was most of the capital district that was down...  i was kind of freaking out: i really wasn't looking forward to driving home with no traffic lights.  just before i left work i called my apartment in albany to see if my answering machine was going to pick up... and it didn't.  the whole way home i listened to talk radio and i totally starting freaking out when i realized how widespread the outage was.  beck called to say that the power was indeed out everywhere.  i'm assuming she's stuck at work now working on getting things going again (she works for a power company "mid state" [between albany and NYC]).  she said she didn't know what was going on yet, but had to hang up quickly because they were being told something.  she did say that her parents' answering machine picked up so she supposed that there was power in clifton park.  i was thinking about going up to my parents' house because even if there was no one there it'd feel less lonely if they had power and i didn't.  but when i got into albany i noticed there were pockets that had power.  some streetlights worked, some didn't  and when i got to my apartment i almost jumped for joy when i approached my building and i heard a fan in an upstairs apartment going.  i guess the power subsequently went off in clifton park, because alex just called and said they now had no power and i called my parents' house again and this time their answering machine didn't pick up.    so yeah.  very lucky girl.  i'm watching MSNBC with a fan blowing right on me.  i'm gonna shut down my computer because i'm thinking there's definite potential for the power to go on and off.  i so hope the power stays on here.  i hope it comes on quickly, especially in new york and other cities where people are stuck in elevators and subways.  that sucks.  i've gathered my candles.  i wish i had a flashlight and some batteries for my little black and white tv/radio.  god, i hope the power doesn't go off.  i don't want to be stuck here alone in the dark (especially since there's this  enormous  spider in the window in the living room and for some reason i feel that if the power would go off it would try and kill me).

      i was  so tired  by the end of the day at work yesterday.  i got home and just passed out on the couch and it was so nice to sleep.  i wish i was sleeping now...  Alex came over and we went to Ruby Tuesday's for dinner.  you've gotta love Tuesdays.  they almost always have 2 for 1 drink specials and they have the best salad bar.  i always get the salad bar and baked potato combo because it's relativley cheap (only a couple dollars more than a fast food meal), good, and you get a lot of food.  we went to see  28 days later  afterwards.  i thought the movie was really good.  it was scary and stressful to watch, but it had a good ending, so that rocks.  they had an alternate ending after the credits which they kind of made a big deal about by putting it on the marquee: "(Alt/End)"  we stayed after the credits to watch the alternate ending.  wasn't worth it.  ah well.  liked the ending that they chose for the movie though.    today at work is annoying.  i've been so productive so far this week.  my productiveness started last friday.  it's stalled today.  and it's not even my fault.  they fucked with the server yesterday for no reason and now nothing works.  so suck.  i need to get tons of shit done before i leave for vacation and i only have 6.5 work days left...    ...ugh.  i guess i could file.  work rots.

      so i just watched  the banger singers  on hbo.  it wasn't as awful as i thought it'd be.  which isn't to say it was great.  it was ok.  there was one part though that got me a little hysterical, and that was when the younger, "art-y" sister failed her driving test.  she runs into the dmv screaming about how they failed her for no reason and just generally throwing a fit.  and i just got hysterical because that's  exactly  how my little sister acted when she failed her driving test.  i was so embarrassed...    after the movie i flipped over to bravo and now i'm watching  queer eye for the straight guy  and they've got this cute teddy bear kind of guy on it and it's hysterical.  the fashion guy was helping him put contacts in and the innuendos were flying and it was just too freaking funny...  he said, "hold your lower lid open, it's going to want to close up automatically like a sphincter."  hysterical.  it's back on...  ...i wish i'd seen this one from the beginning.  it's so freaking funny.  i keep laughing out loud.  they perform a makeover on the guy.  this one included "manscaping": they trimmed his nose hair, shaved his back and trimmed his chest hair.  their theory on manscaping: "it makes a midsection look smaller and just about everything else look bigger."  (i was hysterical when they said that). they send him out on a date with his girlfriend and then they watch the video of it and comment.  and it's  so  funny.  they comment on how cute the girlfriend is and they critique the guy as he does or doesn't follow their directions.  ohmygod, it's so funny.  love this show.  the best part is watching the guy who's been madeover be so proud of himself.  it's  so  cute.  at the end they discuss over cosmos.  too funny.  too adictive.  i must find out when the next one's on...

      so there's this new girl at work who drives the most annoying car in the world.  it's a black honda, and i'm not sure if it's an accord or a civic.  civics are cheaper, that's probably what it is.  anyway.  it's so irritating.  it's lowered (stupid) with custom rims and an added on spoiler that looks like a handle.  the tail lights are clear, of course, and she's got a huge exhaust on it.  her license plate frame is chrome and she's got a custom plate: "GRLSPLA2".  i hate that car, so very much.  the girl seriously just got out of college, so you know mommy and daddy bought her that car.  and it just looks so stupid.  she doesn't even drive it fast either (or, at least, not as fast as me).  and she smokes in it, which just grosses me out.  when people smoke in their cars it just totally ruins the interior: makes it reek and stains the roof ( ew ).  how can you do so much work to your car and then ruin it by smoking in it?  damn, just wait until you stop and then light up.  i don't know why i hate that car as much as i do, but the sight of it just irritates the crap out of me.  every time i'm behind it i get this evil delight out of seeing that the brake light bar on her custom spoiler doesn't light up the whole way which just makes it look cheap and shitty.  i'm so evil.  i shouldn't randomly hate things.  whatever.  i still hate that stupid car.

      saturday i went to the track with beck and her man and some of his friends.  we had a great time even though it was opressivly hot out.  beck hadn't ever been to the track before and i taught her how to place bets.  i can't say that i told her how to bet, because i really have no idea how to pick a horse, but i know how to place a bet (having learned from working as a mutual clerk at the track a couple of years ago).  she did well her first race (we got there at about the 5th race, but didn't place any bets until the 6th): she won $5.10 on a $2 bet (i think on a show, can't remember).  the rest of the day wasn't so good until the 9th race when she went back to that first window she bet at and won $16.90 on a $2 to show on one of the longshots.  the odds on that horse were 55:1, so it was awesome that it came in.    afterwards we went with the group to the ripe tomato for dinner.  it was pretty good, but more expensive than i thought it'd be.  i (thankfully) had enough money on me (because how embarrassing would  that  have been?).  i had this pasta dish that was spaghetti tossed in olive oil and brocolli, mushrooms and whole roasted garlic ( yum ) which was  hella  good.  it was served with this rosemary olive bread that was divine.  the place was packed and the dessert bus (really couldn't be called a tray because it was huge) kept rolling by and the stuff on it looked amazing but we did not partake.    we went to the parting glass afterwards to play darts.  the parting glass was also packed and that was not fun.  a throng of dumbass downstaters was there and apparently none of them had ever been in a bart with a dartroom before because they kept strolling in front of the dart boards.  it was really frustrating.  this one really drunk guy was standing right by our board and he kept putting his arm on the shelf below it and beck hit him with a dart (well, it rebounded off the board) and he still didn't move.  he just stood there and wined about how it hurt.  boo hoo.  had to have been a downstate boy.  suck it up, man.  we played two games, but it was just heinously crowded with a ton of stupid people, so we left right after the second game.  i dislike saratoga during the track season.  or i guess i dislike the parting glass then.  i like the parting glass in the fall/winter/spring.  not crowded.  good irish music playing.  room to breathe/talk/play darts.  i don't think i'm going back there until after track season.    saturday was a surprisingly good day.  i didn't anticipate going to the track/saratoga and i ended up going and had a great time.  so rock :)  i love it when days are surprisingly good.    today was surprisingly good at the end: i found out that my mom is willing to loan me money so i can go on my trip.  rock.  that's a huge weight off my shoulders.  so now i have to really start getting my shit together for this trip: decide if i'm taking traveler's checks, figure out what to pack and what i'm packing it in, get more of a schedule set of how we want to spend our time in dublin (beck has a scotland schedule put together)...  and we leave in 12 days from today.  rock!  very exciting...  but very stressfull...

      So I thought  yesterday  was hard to concentrate on work...  I should have just taken today off because this blows, sitting here listening to everyone be productive around me and being unable to think about anything other than what I need to do to get myself on my way this afternoon.    Last night I met Dodi at Crossgates.  Our mission was to find me some sort of comfy travel outfit.  I was looking at yoga pants at Lerner, but they were too short (why,  why  can't they make "longs" if they can make "shorts" and "regulars"?).  Dodi suggested that we hit H&M because there were some sweatpants there that she bought the other day that were almost too long on her so she thought they might be long enough for me.  First we stopped at Ruby Tuesday's for dinner and Dodi bought because she rules.  I totally love Tuesday's: they have a large, wonderful salad bar (I always get the baked potato/salad bar combo which rocks) and they almost always have 2 for 1 drinks.  Awesome.  So yeah, had a very good, very filling dinner and then Dodi and I went to H&M where we spent like an hour and lots of money.  I got this cute sweatsuit that I'm going to wear to travel in today.  Very cute: it's olive green with bright orange laces to hold up the pants and at the hood.  The bright orange kind of threw me, but I decided that the pants were long enough like Dodi said they'd be and they fit awesomely and the hoodie fit great as well, so I had to get it.  I also got these hella freaking awesome flare cargo type pants that rule.  I'm so excited about those pants...    Later Alex came over and I dragged him to Target where I bought containers to put my shampoo and conditioner in and wrapping paper for a wedding shower gift (the shower's this weekend and I'm missing it, but I work with the sister of the bride so I can give the gift to her today).  We went to see a movie afterwards.  We saw  Grind  in the upstairs theater at Crossgates.  The theater was ghetto compared to the big ones downstairs and the air conditioning wasn't really working right (it was humid and smelled weird in there).  The movie started out slow but got good by the end of it.  One of the stoner's from  Supertroopers  was in this movie (the blonde one) and his character was "Sweet Lou".  Sweet Lou was awesome...  he was this kind of lounge lizard type guy who hit on all the women and made out with most of them.  At one point they were asked to clean up port-a-potties that they'd knocked over and he said, "Sweet Lou cleans no man's poo".  Very funny...  anyway, so the movie was better than I expected.  We hung out for a while at my apartment and I didn't end up going to bed until 3am.  And so now I'm tired.     Yeah.  Tired and not productive and peeing my pants about leaving for Europe tonight.

      so never watch sex and the city if you've just been packing and you've already decided that you hate all your clothes and/or that you're fat.  because it'll just make you feel bad about it all over again.    i want new clothes.  and new shoes.    damn, i hate being poor.  i really have to follow mary ellen's advice and marry for money.  she says you can always learn to love them.

      so i can't pack.  i don't know how.  i'm hella proud of myself for attempting to start tonight because i only have two more nights left before i go.  but i did a crappy job of packing.  i hate all my clothes and i guess that means that i feel like i have to bring all of my clothes with me because if i decide that something is just too heinous to wear i have a back up.  i cannot for some reason get my head around the thought of bringing less shirts than days that i'm away.  i just can't for some reason think about rewearing a shirt on a single trip.  i think i need to get over that because i'm gone for 10 days and i have a small bag...  packing blows.  i hate my clothes.  (that was kind of poetic.  i meant it that way.  yeah. just needs a final line. whatever.)  just watched queer eye for the straight guy.  that guy was all a man's man around the gay guys and all homophobic.  but then he got with his girlfriend and started talking all almost baby talk. you know, really exaggerated happy and calling each other by pet names.  it made me ill.  nothing is more unattractive than a guy talking that way.  ew.  yeah.  sex and the city is on.  then nip/tuck.  i should really go to bed though...

      3 days.  that's rediculous.  i'm so excited!  :)  in 4 days I'll be in London.  In 5 days I'll be in Dublin.  and in 10 days I'll be in Scotland.  rock!!!!    i've got no packing done.  yeah, i rule.  i don't even know for sure what i'm bringing.  i need to remember to pack towels and a pillow case and i have to figure out what i'm going to bring to sleep in.  i wanted to find one of those really lightweight sleeping bags that folds up to like nothing.  i think they're called silk bags or something.  i figured i could just bring one of my queen sized sheets and wrap myself up in it.  or i could get a really cheap twin sized duvet that would be like a sheet sleeping bag.  Alex offered me his sleeping bag.  he says that it folds up very small.  my suitcase is so small, but i don't want to bring anything bigger than that because it'd be a hassle on public transportation.    so exciting.  since we're travelling business class we get all sorts of perks.  like we get free drinks and we get to use the lounges at the airports, including the spa at heathrow.   urlLink ba business class  rules!  i'm so excited.  this is such a real grown up vacation :)  i need to get a travel power converter so that i'll be able to charge my camera (because a dead camera is useless) and my palm (because i have  everything  in there.  exciting.  god.  i can't concentrate on work.  and i can't believe it's only 10:15...  ugh...

      So this happened about an hour ago (13:40 or so)    I witnessed the most extreme road rage ever (ok, well not ever.  in case you haven't notice i'm kind of prone to exageration...).  I was in a left turn lane turning from wolf road onto rte 155 or whatever the road that goes by Albany airport is.  At that intersection there are 2 left turn lanes.  In front of me in the outer right turn lane was a small white car.  In the inner left turn lane coming up next to the white car was a hunter green Mitsubishi Montero sport (NYS license plate BXL 1125).    The white car in front of me sort of started drifting to the left  it looked like it was going to go into the Monteros lane.  The Montero swerved to the left while at the same time the white car realized it was going to hit the Montero and corrected itself back into the outer left turn lane in front of me.  After the Montero had regained control and was proceeding normally back in her lane to go through the turn (we had left turn green arrows) she beeped her horn and then continued on her way.  In the meantime the white car had waited for the Montero to go past and she merged into that lane behind the Montero.    Then the Montero turned psycho.  She suddenly slammed on her brakes twice: once before beginning her turn and a second time in the middle of the turn.  She completed the turn and came to a halt behind traffic stopped at the red in front of us.  I ended up stopping to the right and slightly back from the Montero.  The white car pulled up to the left of the Montero so that they could get on the on ramp to the Northway when the light changed.  She ended up stopping right next to the Montero.  We were all under an overpass of the Northway and waiting for the light to turn green.    The Montero lady started to blare her horn.  Shed lean on it for about 15 seconds and then repeatedly beep it for another 15 seconds before shed lean on it again.  And the whole time she was screaming out her window at the woman in the white car (You fucking bitch!  Get off your cell phone!  Its illegal in New York you bitch! etc).  She was psychotic.  It was one of the craziest things Ive ever witnessed.  I mean, wow lady, let it go.  Take a breath.  Ease up.  I mean, talking on your cell while driving will get you a ticket, but so will road rage.  And I think the road rage is more dangerous than cell phone usage.    What is wrong with people?  Everyone is so mean to everyone else!  Why do we have to be that way?  It was so scary watching this woman go off on the other woman when really, there was no harm done.  An accident almost happened, but it didnt.  Cant the Montero lady be happy about that?  And seriously, if they had collided, there were no other cars around and theyd been going at such a slow speed that most likely no one would have been hurt and cars are easily repaired.  I mean, I understand being upset that you almost were in an accident, but its psychotic to take it to that extent.    People, in general, just need to calm down.

      So I was right yesterday...  I still ended up being late to work.  I bet Im late again today, even though I totally woke up "on time" again...  I think this means I still haven't fully adjusted.  Well, tomorrow's Saturday so I can catch up on some sleep then...    I hope Im in a better mood today.  I mean, I wasn't in a completely bad mood yesterday, but I wasn't my normal chipper self either.  I am for some reason having a very tough time adjusting back to my normal life.  Im suddenly not happy with it.  Im just... dissatisfied.    Im disappointed in myself that Ive accumulated so much debt that I feel trapped in the life that Im in right now.  Id like to do something different.  Im not happy in my job, I just dont like it.  Its not like I dont like it enough to just up and quit, but Im already ready for a change.  I hate the routine that is my job, but most jobs that appeal to me for their lack of routine wont start me at enough money for me to live on (and we arrive back at the debt problem again).  Ive got no one to blame but myself and my shopoholic ways.    Im working on a plan to do something about it though.  Im hoping to acquire a loan that would help me to pay off all the credit card debt within five years.  It would be a major, hefty loan (yes, larger than you think) and so Im not sure that a bank would give it to me, especially since Ive got nothing for collateral (the car already has a lien on it of course).  But if I got it, Id have the credit card debt and the car paid off in five years.  And then Id be free.  And still young not thirty yet   So I guess Ill stop being unhappy and start doing something about it.  Ill go for the loan and then work on my budget and see what I need to live on and hopefully Ill be able to make a job change.  Its kind of weird that suddenly I need to change, but thats the person that Ive become in the last year or so I seem to fear becoming stale.   I read my horoscope from my birthday again the other day: You will be incredibly impulsive this year: You will come and go at the drop of a hat and you will change direction, both in your personal life and in your career, without hesitation. Travel of all kinds is especially well starred, and the further away your adventures take you, the more you will get out of them. You may decide not to come back.  Its actually incredible how much that seems to apply to me.  I dont know what it was about the trip, but now that Im back I feel the need again for change.  And it was right, I didnt want to come back.  Strange.  Well, here Ive wasted enough time again after getting up early that Ill most likely be late again to work today  sigh.

      so i think i'm finally catching up with my sleep.  i am up earlier today than i'd normally be, but i did go to sleep much earlier than i normally would...  i stayed late at work yesterday - until about 6 - because they were actually offering overtime, so i figured, what the heck, i've got crap to do, so i'll stay and work on it.  Carrie was looking depressed (her scottish man left for scotland on monday) and i had nothing in my house to make for dinner so i invited carrie out for dinner at uno's.  we had a great dinner... we sat there and talked for almost 2 hours.  i'm going to miss carrie when she moves to the uk, but i've got her for another year, so it's nothing to worry about now :)    so i didn't get home until a little after 8 and i was way too lazy to go to the grocery store...  i gathered a bunch of the stuff together that i'd saved from my trip and put it with the scrapbook i bought and brought all of it into the living room so i could work on it in front of the tv.  yeah, that didn't happen.  i started to watch "the look for less" on style network and i was all depressed that i'm so poor and i can't go shopping and then i fell asleep...  i hate when i fall asleep on my loveseat in the living room, i always wake up all achey...  i put myself to bed at 10:30 and i woke up at 5...  i made myself sleep more and finally couldn't stand staying in bed any longer about twenty minutes ago.    but just because i got up "on time" doesn't mean i won't be late to work...  i, of course, have done nothing yet to get ready and it's already after 7.  besides, i think it'd shock everyone there too much if i got there on time :)  i need a new job.  something i  want  to go to...  beh.  better get my ready on.

      ah, what the hell.  i'm not able to concentrate at work so i decided to surf the  urlLink irishfest  page because i wanted to have something to be excited about again (not having europe to be excited about anymore sucks).  anyway, so i'm excited for the fest this year because i'll get to see  urlLink hair of the dog  and  urlLink seven nations  and they both  rule .  hotd was  amazing  last year...  a massive crowd of people dancing drunk in the rain...  and i've really come to absolutely  love  seven nations after i saw them on st patrick's day this year, their music is awesome.  so yeah.  excited for both performances...  so i click on the  urlLink performance schedule  and find that HOTD is playing at one stage from 6:30-8:30 and 7N is playing from 7:00 - 8:00 on another.  suckage.  decisions, decisions...  do i go to see HOTD in the hopes that it's as awesome as last year or do i go to see 7N because i haven't seen them since march and they're not local...  i guess i could go see 7N and hit HOTD in time for the end of the set when everyone will be drunk and dancing to "I Used to Work in Chicago"...    beh.  what i really should be doing right now is work and not thinking about what bands i'll see 3 weeks from now...

      cannot concentrate at work today.  i suck.    i'll be good for about ten minutes, typing away, getting stuff done, and then all of a sudden i'll stop and stare at the screen.  i'm still so tired...    but i've got to stop whining.  (it's cold in here.  when will i be warm again?  i've been freezing since the last day in dublin!  sorry... had to whine one more time...)  i miss vacation.  i still haven't gotten to go to my parent's house since i returned.  i went straight home on monday and last night i was too tired...  and tonight i'm tired again.  i think i just want to go home and spend a quiet night in front of the tv working on a scrapbook on my trip...

      so exceedingly tired.  must not go to bed now even though it feels like 1:30 in the morning...  must stay awake so i can adjust back to EST.   ugh.  i really wanted to update the blogs but i think i'm just not up for it yet.   i never appreciated my bed so much as i did last night.  the featherbed was perfectly fluffed and my down comforter felt like a cloud perched on top of me.  i just melted into bed last night, it was so wonderful.    oh.  i need to go to bed...

      so since i had to retire the old brown boots (i'm steppin out this old brown shoe) i allowed myself to buy new brown boots today.  they are awesome!!!  You can view them on  urlLink macys.com here .  they're a dark reddish brown and they are just so cool.  the heel is kind of curvy and girly and i just love these boots so very much, even though they do make me almost 6'1" (oh well, i'm tall, i own it)...  :)  i'm totally going to wear them out tomorrow night on our girls' night out.  beck and dodi and i are planning on going out... probably to jillian's or the big house in albany.  i might have to go get a cute new shirt to wear with one of my denim skirts and my fabulous new boots.

      i woke up late-ish.  i mean, technically it was on time because i woke up at the same time that i wake up every day lately.  but really, it's late, but well, whatever.  anyway, that wasn't the point.  the point was i got up.  yeah, so i got up and everything seemed normal and i took a shower and was rushing around because i was running late and i was in the kitchen trying to get stuff together to bring to work for lunch and i realized i felt weird.  kind of sick.  i walked into the bathroom and i suddenly felt very hot.  really hot and kind of prickly all over.  i looked in the mirror and saw that i had no color in my face and i was glistening with sweat and i understood that i was going to faint.  and since i was alone i really didn't feel like fainting in my bathroom and cracking my head on my toilet and dying there and being found days later with my face half eaten by my cats on the floor of my bathroom so i stumbled out of the bathroom into the living room and layed down on the sofa.  i layed there until i felt a little better and then attempted to get to the kitchen but had to retreat back to the sofa a couple of times before that worked.  i got into the kitchen and looked around for something to eat.  but really, i didn't feel like eating and was pretty irrational and so this took a few minutes before i randomly decided on a can of garbanzo beans.  i opened the can with great difficulty because i was feeling so weak and the damn can opener wouldn't pierce the lid of the can and poured most of the beans into a little rubbermaid container and ate the rest of the beans that wouldn't fit into the container straight out of the can with a fork.  i felt a little better, i mean, i still felt a little weird and out of it but i knew that i was ok enough to drive so i called my supervisor and let her know i was going to be a little late and drove to work.

      just a couple of random things i'd like to mention:  here is a phone conversation i had at work today: "Good morning, Mercury Insurance, this is Alison speaking, how may I help you?" "Ok, I'm not saying it's ok for anyone to spit in a parking lot but..." "I'm sorry, who am I speaking with?!" "...this is Michael - but I just walked out on my way to the diner and I saw a  woman  spit in the parking lot!  Right on the ground!" (Michael is one of the supervisors here at work).  I love the people I work with.  They really make the job bearable...   i need to retire my tall brown leather boots.  and i am  so  upset.  i love those boots.  sure, they make me about 6'2" or so when i wear them, but i've decided to just own that i'm so tall.  i mean, people seem to be really jealous of the height so it must be a good thing... although kissing guys that are shorter than me is slightly uncomfortable, i feel like a giant or something, but i guess i just won't do that standing anymore ;)  anyway... tangent.  so yeah, um... right, the boots.  they are awesome.  they come up to about three inches below my knee and they fit very well.  the leather is a medium dark brown (not mahogany, but not camel... so medium brown i guess...) and it's nice and soft.  there are some skuff marks, but they could clean up well... but it's no use, because i'm apparently allergic to my boots.  there's a band around the top of the inside of the boot that's leather like the outside (and the rest is cloth).  and where the band around the top is against my skin i break out in some sort of rash.  it's so itchy and horrible.  and really unattractive.  i looked it up online and self diagnosed myself to have some sort of allergy to leather or a chemical in the leather that seeps out when my legs sweat.  ew.  so yeah, i only wore the boots for a few hours last night but now i have two bands of, well, almost like tiny hives around my upper calves.  and they itch.  and i read that it'll get worse for like 72 hours before it gets better.  so suck.  and i'm so sad to have to retire those boots!!  i need to get new brown boots though in some sort of manmade material.  god, how ghetto am i?  my body rejects leather!  ;)    i cut myself with a butter knife today.  i think i'm the only person in the world who could manage that.  i'm amazing.  i actually impaled my left index finger.  and it bled and everything.  ew.  but yeah.  cut myself with a butter knife.  i rule :)    cannot wait for the weekend.  sigh.

      so, why would you fake an accent?  one of my insured people is faking a british accent, i think.  he was irritated when he called and i felt like he was faking the accent from the start.  it just sounded too...  i dunno.  perfect.  or something.  it sounded like an accent you'd see in an old movie and the people in the movie are royalty or really rich or something.  and he was bitching at me because he was impatient and his call made no difference because i couldn't move any faster on it than i was and then at the end of the "conversation" (in quotes because it's not really a conversation when it's just one person being very rude to another person and not letting them speak) he actually said, "cheerio!"  i mean, really.  who says that?  i've never heard anyone say that in real life.  and i asked carrie and neither had she and i asked dad and in all his travels neither had he.  so whatever, mr faker!  i've got your number!  there's no need to put on accents!    turns out he's a wedding photographer, and in his voicemail (which we played aloud in the office today and laughed at... we're so mean) he's incredibly over-enthusiastic and he's promoting himself and he says to visit his "absolutely smashing" website and at the end he pretty much yells "cheerio!"  i guess maybe it's his gimmick to get more business as a photographer.  perhaps he thinks that by putting on a british accent people will take him more seriously.  maybe he gets more jobs with a british accent...  it's funny, the first thing he says on his website is that he's "originally from england"...  i mean, i certainly didn't think his photos were anything special.  but i guess he's doing well for himself, because we're going out to look at his  urlLink 2003 porsche boxster  tomorrow.

      had a pretty excellent weekend.  went to a party in saratoga friday night...  the girlfriend of a friend of alex's is vacating her apartment because they're buying a house.  apartment was  beautiful : a two level starting on the second floor of a large victorian.  kitchen was huge with a cute breakfast area, living room was larger than mine...  half bath on that floor and upstairs where the two bedrooms were was a large full bath.  gorgeous apt with lots of cute old house details...  and they only pay $1000/month for it (so, irritatingly, because it's split in 2 they each pay less than i do a month).  feel now that i live in a hovel.  ah well.  party was fun with lots of free booze.  went out with beck and her friends saturday in albany at jillian's.  band was sucky but beer was good.  and pizza later was phenomenal.  quiet day today: was lazy for most of the day then went to meredith's for a  urlLink pampered chef  party.  had a wonderful chocolate mocha trifle and an excellent tomato/dill dip.  stopped at  urlLink price chopper  on the way home and spent almost $100 on food.  but had no food in the house before...  came home and was lazy again... watched monty python on hbo ( and now for something completely different ) which delayed my walking until it was too dark to venture out.  was irritated with self for being so lazy/sedentary but then just made a bagel for dinner and watched faking it on  urlLink bbc america  ( love  that show) and then sex and the city (rooted for carrie and big even though i know i shouldn't) before working on the photo albums...  completed  urlLink london photo album  and made much progress on  urlLink dublin album .  planned on going to bed early but as it is already 11:30 did not necessarily suceed.  (will go to bed now which is technically earlier than i normally do, but not really what one would consider early).

      I'm so excited it's finally Friday!!!   urlLink Irish Fest  is tomorrow, and I've been excited about it for about a year now!!  There's a pre-party tonight at  urlLink McGeary's  which I, of course, am planning on attending.  I woke up in the  best  mood today and got in an even better mood when I got in the car and played a disc full of awesome music: it started with "Mama Told Me Not to Come" and went onto "Me and Julio" and then into a whole bunch of disco.  Awesomely fun music.  I was totally dancing while I was driving into work.  And while I'm really bored here at work and am getting pretty much  nothing  done I'm still in an awesome mood :)  I can't wait to go out tonight and tomorrow!!!    Sigh.  Only a couple more hours of work and then I'm free!!

      so we were  having a discussion at work: Carrie has a claim where our insured rearended a claimant who slammed on her brakes in front of her.  The claimant is telling Carrie that she slammed on her brakes because there was a flock of ducks and a goose in the road in front of her.  (Could you just see someone driving their car into that pack?  It'd be "Oh God!  Duck!  Duck!  Duck!  Duck!  Goose!!" with a thud after each exclamation...)  The claimant said, "I saw the ducks by the side of the road, and I kept thinking, 'stay there, stay there...' but they started to waddle out into the road in front of me and all I could think was, 'big, bloody mess!  feathers!' and I slammed on my brakes."    Carrie thinks this is reasonable and agrees with the claimant that whoever owns the ducks (the claimant states that the ducks appeared to be domesticated) should ultimately be held responsible because he was negligent in leaving his ducks to wonder around.  I think they're insane.  Mary Ellen is all for sueing some farmer as well.  I think they're crazy.    First of all, how can you tell that ducks are domesticated?  And then, ducks are so free spirited, how can you control a duck?  I mean, they can fly, they're not like chickens that you can just keep in a pen.  If some farmer was seriously raising ducks he'd keep them in an enclosed pen which they could not fly out of.  I think this claimant lady is crazy.  This is how you deal with a flock of ducks in the road: you lean on your horn, slow down ( not  slam on your brakes) and if possible pass the ducks.  The ducks will scatter when they hear the horn (and if they don't they deserve to be hit).  And if you (God forbid) hit a duck: oh well.  A duck isn't going to do that much damage.  I believe ducks will, in fact, duck if a vehicle is coming at them (I know, that was bad).    Anyway, I just really think it's crazy to blame a car accident on ducks in the road.  Hit the ducks.  So what if she had to kill a few ducks?  It's better than totalling her car and causing $6000 worth of damage to the car that hit her along with the injuries that she may have caused to herself or the pregnant woman that hit her.

      i had a weird, long dream last night.    i don't remember all of it, but i can remember parts.  i wasn't even thinking about the dream at all after i got up until i got to work and opened up explorer and it got to my home page,  urlLink msn.com  and i saw there was a  urlLink link to a story about giant squid .  and i thought that this was a very odd coincidence because part of my dream last night had a large squid in it.  a squid is a very odd thing to dream about.  i went to  urlLink dreammoods.com  to see if i could gain some insight on what dreaming about a squid might mean...  here's what it said, "To see a squid in your dream, suggests that unconsciously you are feeling threatened.  Your judgment may also be clouded. Perhaps you are not seeing things too clearly at the moment. Alternatively, it symbolizes greed. It is always about what you want."  so hmm...  in my dream the squid helped me across some water by letting me sit on it while it floated across.  and then it became very attached to me and wanted to follow me around after i got out of the water...  it would bounce after me and every time it bounced it made a squeak noise like a dog toy.  and i really didn't want this little squid to be all in love with me and following me around.  so i dunno what that means.  am i greedy and i want a squid to be following me around and in love with me? or am i threatened by the squid?  :)  Also in my dream my parents were having a party.  ("To dream that you are at a party, suggests that you need to get out more and enjoy yourself. ")  I thought there weren't going to be that many people there, but it was mobbed.  and, randomly,  urlLink HOTD  was playing.  i think this part of my dream just means that i'm very, hella excited about  urlLink irish fest .  and maybe it means that i'm conflicted about it though, because it's my dad's birthday and the family is going down to my sister's school that day to all go out to dinner to celebrate and i won't be going and i feel bad about it :(    anyway, strange, long dream...

      Friday night I was supposed to hang out with Alex.  Dodi called me right after work and asked if I'd like to go "grab some chow" with her and I agreed to meet her at Crossgates.  I was excited to wear my new boots out and I was late meeting Dodi because I was having a clothing crisis (couldnt decide what to wear with the boots).  I met Dodi at the mall and we had dinner at Ruby Tuesdays (French Onion soup and salad bar yum!!).      While I was out with Dodi Alex called.  I told him where I was and said I'd call him later.  He mentioned that he had to help a friend move the next morning so he couldn't really stay out too late.  I told him I didn't think I'd be much longer.  Dodi and I scoured the mall for a denim skirt for me (I already have five but none of them fit the exact specifications of the skirt that I need to wear with my new boots).  We looked everywhere and while there were a few promising skirts, there were no winners.  So it was about 9 by the time we left the mall, and we were having fun and so when we got to my car I said, "how's this: I was supposed to hang out with Alex tonight but he's got to get up early etc so how about I call him and if he doesn't seem to disappointed I'll hang out with you instead."  And I started to dial Alex's number and I continued: "I mean, it's not like you're my backup or second choice or anything because I was technically supposed to do something with Alex tonight first, so I'd really be blowing him off" and in the meantime the phone had stopped ringing and suddenly I heard, "who's blowing who off?" from the other end.  I was like "um! No! No one's blowing anyone off!!" and Dodi started laughing at me and we both got hysterical and I told Alex that in the future he should say "hello" when he answered the phone.  He thought it was funny and told me to hang out with Dodi ("go out and get drunk" is what he told us to do) and he'd catch up with me after the moving on Saturday.    So Dodi and I went back to my apartment (because I couldnt convince her to go out, she thought her hair looked terrible) and made frozen margaritas and watched Super Troopers which is one of my favorite movies and, I think, one of the funniest movies ever.  I got a good buzz on because I'd been a little liberal with the tequila and when my phone rang with Beck's ring it took me a while to catch on that it wasn't actually her calling.  It was some random guy, which I thought was one of her friends playing a joke.  But it turns out it wasnt, it was some guy that worked in a restaurant that she'd been to earlier and he had her phone because she dropped it.  I let him know that he should call whatever number was in the phone book for "Kevin" and hung up before I got his name or where he was from.  And then I felt all bad.  But he did end up calling her and he's supposedly sending the phone to her overnight mail, which is exceedingly nice of him, I think.  Dodi left soon after that, she looked like she wasn't feeling too great, and I finished off my margarita and went to bed with a nice buzz which is always kind of a cool feeling: laying in bed slightly confused and very comfortable.    Saturday I cleaned.  All day.  I got up at 1015 and cleaned until 5 when Beck called to invite me to dinner with her and Alex.  My apartment looks much better now than it did before, but I still haven't begun to tackle the bedroom (ugh).  I showered and picked them up at their house and headed out to Friday's.  There was a bit of a wait so we started out at the bar with beer and potato skins and finished up at a table, each of us with an enormous salad.  My salad was very disappointing: it was supposed to have dried cranberries and mandarin orange slices in it, and while it did have some fruit in it, it was mostly full of shredded lettuce and celery.  After dinner we were all supposed to go to the Parting Glass to see HOTD, but Beck didnt want to come because she said she was really tired.  So we tried to convince her to come up with us but she refused and we ended up dropping her off and heading up to 'Toga, just me and Alex.    The show was sold out (it always is) so we couldn't sit in the performance area, but the bar is set up this way:  when you walk in the front door it looks like a normal pub: bar all along one wall with tables and chairs in the center and booths along the other wall.  Then you walk down a hall where the bathrooms are and you come into the performance area: a stage on one end of the hall and rows of tables perpendicular to the stage with small tables all around the periphery of the room.  On the right side of the room there's a double doorway that leads into a longish room with another bar along one wall and dart boards along the wall across from the bar.  Then there are some tables set up at the far end of the room and one of those games against that wall that are in bars that I don't know what it's called...  it's a long table that's all waxed up and you slide discs down towards the end of it and try and get close to the end without falling off.  The whole bar is in dark wood, and they used to have a beautiful old wood floor which for some reason they felt the need to put grey tile look linoleum flooring all over.  Oh, and they stuck a juke box in the dart room.  But other than those two things the bar is awesome, and it's my favorite bar in the area.  ANYWAY... so when we go to see HOTD there we can never get into the performance area, but we can stand in the doorway of those double doors between the performance area and the dart room and as long as we aren't blocking traffic that's ok.  So we got there, got a couple of pints, and staked out our spots by the door.    The show was awesome :)  You could tell that they were getting warmed up for Irish Fest this weekend.  I got very drunk... I had about 7 pints...  but I didn't have a full one for the Barley Mow and I was very upset about that.  They played all my favorite songs and they even ended with "The Parting Glass" which they don't really do all that often, it's just the big guy singing it by himself and it's amazing.  We stayed till the end of the show and then headed home where I promptly passed out.    Sunday was a lazy day.  I was going to finish cleaning, but I didn't feel like it.  I went to my parents' house for a while and hung out with my dad (I'm SUCH a daddy's girl) and then went home and watched Sex and the City and Carnivale on HBO while talking to Dodi on the phone and went to bed before midnight.      Anyway... so that was the weekend.  I SO enjoyed HOTD and was so excited to see them :)  I'm dying this week... it's going so slow.  I'm so excited for Irish Fest this weekend.  And now I'm all afraid that hurricane Isabelle is going to cause it to be cancelled and that would just crush me.  Beck keeps telling me not to build myself up so much for things like that (I used to build myself up for every weekend and then be let down if it wasnt all I wanted it to be) but its hard not to for this.  I so, so, so hope it doesnt get rained out!!  Only 4 more days!!

      So I had a  fabulous  weekend!  :)   Friday   So I left work a little early and picked up the game that I wanted to get my Dad for his birthday at CompUSA.  I scooted down to the parent's house in the hopes that I'd catch the whole family there (my sister was home for a doctor's appointment and was leaving right away) but it didn't work out that way because dad went to donate blood in the meantime and Amy was all antsy in her pantsy to leave after her appointment.  So we did cake and presents just Mom, Dad, the two little guys and me.  It was a birthday celebrated in two shifts because the next day on Dad's actual birthday Mom, Dad, and the two little guys drove down to Amy's school to pick her and David up (who'd gone down with Amy the night before to visit) and go out to dinner at a Japanese restaurant.    Anyway, so I left the 'rent's house a little before 7 because they were all going to a Cub Scout pack meeting and I needed to go home and get ready to go out.  I got to my apartment and looked around and thought, "I better pick this place up a little bit before tomorrow because I bet there will be people here at some point" but then concentrated on trying to figure out what I was going to wear out that night because that was more pressing than guests that may or may not be there the next day.    Then Alex called.  He said he was on his way to the apartment and that the plan was for Foster and his girlfriend (Amy) to meet us at my apartment and then we'd all go to McGeary's and they were going to be on their way in about 10 minutes.  So I said, "ok, well I'll be running around cleaning like a madwoman so you better use the key I gave you to feed the cats with to let yourself in because hopefully I'll be done cleaning and in the shower by the time you get here."  Alex responded: "There's no need to clean."  I thought, "oh, you're such a boy" and I said, "oh, yes, there is a need..." and I hung up and proceeded to dash around my apartment picking shit up.  I cleaned the cat litter and emptied the trash and picked up dishes... the apartment wasn't really all  that  bad, but all I could think of was a couple of weeks ago when we went to Amy's old apartment for her moving out party and she gave us a tour and the place was just so beautiful.  And now they were going to come to my hovel and it was in no state for a tour.  I ran into the bedroom and was about to start trying to move the masses of clothing on the floor but decided that if there was a tour it would not include the bedroom and shut the door.  So I moved on and was hurriedly trying to do the dishes when Alex walked in.  He took a look at my face and said, "What can I do?" and I asked him to please take the garbage out to the dumpster and I proceeded to tidy up the kitchen and then just gave up and jumped in the shower.    I hurriedly got ready and had finally finished rushing around when Alex checked his voicemail and found out that Foster and Amy had gone straight to McGeary's and we had to meet them there.  So the cleaning like a madwoman was all in vain!  Ah well.    We met Foster and Amy at McGeary's and were surprised at how few people there were in the bar when you walked in.  We reasoned that it was because it was so early (8:30).  We got a round (I decided to start with Bailey's on the rocks) and imbibed for a bit in the front bar room.  At one point we decided to go into the performance area...  and there we found all the people.  The performance area was  packed .   urlLink Seamus Kennedy  was playing.  I saw him last year at Irish Fest just as I was becoming drunk and I remembered that he was very funny.  For some reason Friday night he was performing the Barley Mow, like, every other song.  Perhaps he felt that he needed to get the crowd drunk.  I believe he was doing a good job.  We didn't stay in that area for too long because it was very crowded and we were mostly interested in seeing the last band of the night, the  urlLink Glengarry Bhoys , so we went back into the less crowded front bar area.  Joe, Alex's friend, showed up before too long to join us in our pre-irish fest partying.  The drinks kept coming, but I was unfortunately unable to get drunk off the Bailey's.  I did switch to Guinness for a round, which happily gave me a buzz, but when the next round was bought I was given another Bailey's and the buzz soon left me.  I informed Alex that as I was unable to get drunk that night I would be driving home.  He happily consumed.    We stayed in the bar area until the band that was playing in between Seamus Kennedy and the Glengarry Bhoys ended and then we went into the performance area to stake out a good spot.  The Glengarry Bhoys were  awesome .  I'd only ever seen them once before and it was under the tent outside McGeary's in the summer and I don't really enjoy shows under the tent because they're not as "intimate" or something.  This show ruled with tons of people packed in front of the stage dancing and jumping around.  When the show was over everyone spilled out the door to the sidewalk in front of the bar and stood in clumps deciding where to go next.  Foster and Amy went home and Joe and Alex decided to not go to another bar so we all went home as well.     Saturday   Alex and I went to breakfast at Quintessence and I had the best bacon and eggs I'd ever had in my life.  Alex had the New Yorker breakfast which had corned beef hash under the eggs.  He let me try some of the hash and it was awesome.  Totally not from a can... The corn beef was so freaking tasty.  Anyway...  Breakfast was a little late (ok, technically it wasn't even brunch... it was definitely lunch) and we had to rush a bit to get ready to go to Irish Fest.  Foster met us at my apartment at around 2:30 and we watched TV for a bit to waste some time.  We were going to get the 3:15 shuttle from the  urlLink Albany Hibernian Hall  which is like a block from my place.  We walked over there and were there by about 3:00.  And we waited.  And waited.  We'd rushed over there without hitting an ATM because we were afraid of missing the bus.  But it never showed up.  There was a small crowd there waiting, so we knew we were in the right place.  Around quarter of 4 Foster called over to the Mohawk Ambulance Station where he works to ask if there were any spare cars... and he got a lift from the ambulance to the ATM about 3 blocks up.  When he arrived back he went inside the AOH hall to see if there was any news on the bus.  They said it was stuck in traffic almost in the fairgrounds and that it'd be about an hour before it even got back here.  We decided to abort on the bus and we were leaving the parking lot when one of the women who was waiting there also came running around the building yelling, "the bus is here!"  We ran around the corner and boarded the bus...   The bus was already pretty full.  We made our way towards the back of the bus (flashes of Forrest Gump: "taken... this seat's taken...") and Alex and I found an empty seat while Foster sat with the woman who let us know the bus had arrived.  The ride took a little over an hour because of the traffic caused by construction right outside of the fairgrounds.  On the last leg there while the bus was in stop and go traffic a few of our fellow passengers who had apparently been drinking at the AOH hall convinced the bus driver to open the door and they poured out into a field to the right of the bus.  We all watched as about four guys and one girl ran towards a small group of trees and brush.  They'd reached the trees and had hidden themselves to go about their business when the bus started moving forward.  The whole bus looked out the windows on the right side as we moved forward and our fellow passengers answering nature's call came into view, including the one female who could clearly be seen squatting with her shorts around her ankles.  The bus erupted in laughter and the show continued as they began running to catch up with the bus.  Traffic had actually started moving and they would have been left behind had it not been for their friends still on the bus who convinced the busdriver to pull to the side and let them catch up.    The bus pulled up to the gate by the grove stage at the Altamont fairgrounds shortly thereafter.  We filed out of the bus and got in the "express" line to get into the fest as we'd already bought our tickets.  Joe (who Alex had convinced to come along with us the night before) showed up at the same time we did and caught up with us inside the gates.  We immediately headed to the nearest beer tent where we got 2 pints of Guinness (Alex and me) and two black and tans (Foster and Joe).  We took our beers for a walk up to the main part of the festival where the  urlLink Young Dubliners  were playing.  They're sponsored by  urlLink Killian's  and if you've ever seen that Killian's commercial with a Celtic rock song playing in the background, that's them.  They were pretty decent (think I might need to listen to them now).  We needed a refill on our beers pretty quickly so we walked back down to the beer tent by the grove stage because it wasn't crowded (yet) and then walked back up and listened to some pipers before it was time to go see  urlLink HOTD .    The  urlLink HOTD  show was  awesome .  It was a beautiful day and the concert was early enough that a lot of people stayed and it seemed like the entire festival was at the grove stage for the concert.  The whole area was packed with people - all the seats were full and people were standing the whole way up the hill.  And down in front of the stage was a giant mass of revilers dancing.  We met up with Una and her boyfriend and his sister with her boyfriend and stood with them for a while.  The boys left me to get beer a couple of times, but I had a good time with Una and that crew.  Murph showed up with his wife and a girl named Sarah who also knew all the HOTD songs so I was glad to have people to sing/drink with.  During the break Una and Molly (boyfriend's sister) went to the bathroom and invited me along.  I figured I should go while I had company even though I'd be "breaking the seal".  We walked up to the bathroom which of course had a line for the women's room that was 4 times as long as the line for the men's room.  We got in the women's line and the girl in front of Una joked about just going to the men's room and Una immediately spun around and headed for the men's room with Molly in tow.  I followed behind them and when we were just about to enter I kind of whimpered, "Una, I don't think I can do this" and they told me to just come along.  The attendant in the men's room ushered us to the first two stalls and even offered to clean the seats off for us.  He handed us a fresh roll of paper towels and we were generally accepted without any complaint.  Alex called while we were in there and I drunkenly yelled into the phone, "I'm in the men's room, I'll be right out!"    We made it back to the group before the second set started and Alex came down to tell me that Foster had bought us a sausage and peppers sandwich and some french fries.  I wasn't hungry but I figured that I'd go up and eat because I hadn't eaten anything since my fabulous breakfast at Quintessence.  I'd never had a sausage and pepper sandwich that was so good...  I finished the quarter of it that Alex hadn't eaten...  and the fries weren't bad either.  Actually, I bet the food was horrible but I was  drunk  at that point so I didn't know any better.  Somehow I kept getting Guinness handed to me and I believe by that time I'd had 5 pints and we'd been there for 2 hours.  And the Guinness certainly does make me drunk.  We debated momentarily about whether to stay and watch the rest of HOTD or to go see  urlLink 7N , but HOTD was so good and the vibe of the crowd was so contagious that we decided to stay for the second set.  So after we ate I practically skipped down the hill with the boys in tow to rejoin the group.  But I really wanted to be up front with everybody dancing.  And I was about to just go up on my own when Foster said, "Let's go" and Alex, Foster and I went down to the pit of dancers.  I can't tell you all the songs they played.  But I can tell you that I had an amazing time.  Alex and Foster left to get more beers and HOTD suddenly started up with "I Used to Work in Chicago" without any real prompting from the audience (usually the audience really almost has to beg to hear that song) and the beer mission was quickly aborted to rejoin me in the throng of celebrating drunks.  After the song they left me to go get the beers and I danced with the random people around me.  I believe the big guy sang "Love the One You're With" at one point and I think they might have sang "Me and Julio".  The second set was less trad music and more just awesome party music (but I mean, there was plenty of trad thrown in there).  It was the best HOTD concert since last irish fest.    After the show we stumbled up the hill to the main festival grounds to watch a couple of other bands but didn't really get into anything and decided to head home early.  We had to go back to the grove stage area to catch the bus and a couple of the HOTD band members, Eric and Rick, were still there cleaning up.  Foster, who knows everyone and can get along with any one, struck up a conversation with Eric (who gave him a sip of something out of his hip flask) and was soon dancing on the stage.  We shook hands with Eric and yelled "good show" to Rick as we hurried towards the bus which happened to be waiting there. The bus wasn't full and we each took our own seat and didn't have long to wait before the bus started rolling home.  Only it rolled over every bump.  And this girl was not happy with that.  And this girl will end the posting now about the bus because the rest is an embarrassing blur.  I only have this to say: I would have been fine if the bus ride wasn't so bumpy.    Anyway...  It was a  fantastic  night.  I was slightly worried coming up to Irish Fest that I was building it up too much and it wouldn't be as awesome as last year, but it definitely was :)  And now I'm all kind of sad because I don't have it to look forward to...  but what a night!  :)

      it's been so long since i've posted...  i suck.    i guess i haven't posted because there's been nothing overly interesting to write about.  well, i guess that's not necessarily true, but i haven't been in the mood to formulate a good post.  so here's a summary of the last week or so and hopefully i'll be able to start posting again this week...    last thursday was alex's birthday and i baked him a carrot cake because he had mentioned that he liked carrot cake...  i sucked it up...  i forgot to add cinnamon and nutmeg and it was awful.  but the frosting was good...  he was sweet though, he said that it was good and almost ate a whole piece.  i'm normally pretty good at baking so i'm irritated that it came out crappy...  ah well.  i'll have to bake a pie or something to prove to myself that i'm not a horrible baker.  i took alex out to dinner for his birthday...  we went to the macaroni grill because that's where he chose to go and we had a pretty excellent meal.  we went to the big house afterwards and then wondered around the downtown bar area but it was pretty quiet so we ended up going back to my place early.  it was a nice night and alex appeared to have had a good time :)  so...  what else...  i got a haircut, i look fabulous...  got new sneakers last week - a phenomenal deal (paid $35 for $85 shoes)...  the weekend was quiet and that suited me fine...  um...  we had two new people start at work yesterday and i've been trying to appear like a good little worker so really i've got to stop posting soon and get back to work...  carrie won a free lunch at uno's and we're all going in about an hour so that's excellent.  we have to listen to some 10 minute thing about retirement planning from an American Express rep, but hopefully that won't be too painful...    anyway.  so i'm excited that it's cooler out and i'm waiting for the leaves to change.  i'm pretty shocked that it's the end of september and it really doesn't look like fall right now...  i can't wait to do fall things like pick apples and go look at leaves and bake pies etc...    beh.  back to work...

      (so the first trip to the gym was a success and i plan on returning tonight to try out a class)  today is my friend meredith from work's birthday.  last night i went grocery shopping.  on my birthday in july meredith baked me a very delicious, moist, excellent chocolate cake.  i wished to return the favor.  last night i was tired.  alex and i didn't get to the grocery store until about 9:30/9:45.  we walked into the produce section and then towards the back right corner of the store where the bakery was located.  i wanted to buy a cake.  i did not want to make a cake.  alex told me i was a bad friend because meredith made me a cake and i wanted to buy her one from price chopper.  he said he was ashamed that i would not make a cake for her.  "but i'm tired!" i whined.  alex laughed at me and told me he was just kidding.  he helped me pick out a particularly yummy looking snickers cake.    i knew that meredith would be in late today because she had to pick up a rental car before work.  i made an effort to get here early (or at least on time) anyways, but still did not get here until about 5 after.  damn my late disorder!  meredith was not here yet.  i snuck the cake into the back of the refridgerator and stuck her birthday card on her desk.  i emailed everyone in our department but meredith that i brought in a snickers cake to surprise meredith in honor of her birthday and we would have it at about 2:15.    about 1:15 meredith, carrie and i went to the american cafe at colonie center mall for lunch.  our waitress was horrible and shared too much information.  we came back late.  very late.  while we were walking in michael yelled out to me, "well ali, we found the snickers cake on our own and just went ahead and ate it" to which i responded, "well, thanks michael it  was  a surprise until now".  we all laughed over it.  michael puts his foot in his mouth all the time.  he accidently told carrie who dies in harry potter 5 a couple of weeks ago.    the cake was very good.  michael believed for a few minutes that i made it.  it's never dull in the office when michael is here.

      my pants were getting tight.  and my cute/tight jeans were not looking so cute anymore.    dammit.    why can't i just eat whatever i want, drink whatever i want and sit around and watch tv and not get fat?  i had a fat issue.  so i had to do something.  i worked hard a couple of years ago to get rid of 60 lbs, i will not let myself climb back up there.  so i began researching fitness centers in the area:    i used to belong to  urlLink YMCA  with my family.  they still go there, but i'm not eligable to be a family member anymore according to their rules (how weird is that?) and it's damn expensive to join there (especially  that  Y) as a single person.    alex goes to  urlLink gold's gym .  but that place is also expensive (and i don't get a handy "life saver" discount like alex does) and i've heard from some girls that it's kind of a body builder place.    carrie and amy go to  urlLink ABC Sports & Fitness .  i went there with carrie yesterday because she was going to let me "sublet" her membership because she wasn't using it enough to make the $45 a month worth it for her.  it was a very nice facility and amy especially raves about the classes there, but i felt weird about subletting a membership and was worried about getting caught.  so i declined her offer.    there's a  urlLink bally's  at the mall, but i'm sure it's expensive and if you work out there anyone walking by in the mall can look in the large windows and see you sweat...  so i ruled that one out as well.    then i found the website for  urlLink the fitness factory .  michael at work goes to that gym and he loves it.  and the website actually had prices on it.  and schedules for the aerobics classes.  and there are locations in albany on the way home from work and one in clifton park.  and the prices are pretty low.  so today during lunch i dragged meredith with me to check it out.  they had a decent number of elliptical machines (my favorite), a large weight room with a seperate women's only weight room, tanning beds (an extra charge), and a nice sized aerobics room.  the locker rooms were decent... not anally clean like the Y in Clifton Park, but not overly scummy either.    so i decided to just go ahead and buy a membership at the fitness factory.  and i was in luck because they were running a special: $100 for 100 days.  so now i have a membership there paid through jan 15.  i am so excited.  i brought workout clothes with me today so i can go after work.  i'm hoping to get there at least three times a week.  and the increased activity combined with my new willingness to go back to "being good" in my eating habits will hopefully pay off.    fat issue be gone!

      i love my living room.  and i'll tell you why.  it's a real room.  it has furniture that matches.  there is accent lighting.  there are curtains.  there is a bookshelf with both books and little nicknacks displayed.  there are framed pictures and art on the walls.  when you walk in the room you can tell that thought went into it and things weren't haphazzardly deposited in the room.    my living room is my favorite room of my apartment.  it represents to me the fact that i am independent.  when i lived at home with my parents i never had a living room of my own.  sure, i have my own bedroom which had many of the things a living room has and i was able to do pretty much anything i wanted with that room but when it came down to it, it was my parents's room and they were just letting me use it.  but now i am living on my own.  i can be my own person.  and while that means that i am responsible for myself in every way, i'm glad to be.  i don't have to worry about stepping on someone's toes when i make decisions about my life.  it's my life, my own, and i can live it the way i want to.    my living room is like the actual physical manifestation of my being on my own, which explains my obsession with it.  the last month saw me restless and seeking change.  i was unfocused in my need for change though, and unsure what i wanted.  i let the clutter build in my apartment and neglected the cleaning.  but somehow i've gotten past that need for change.  i'm not sure what did it, but i've found myself happy again with where i'm at.  i'm content with what i have.  i don't think i'm settling, either.  i think i'm just appreciating what i have.  so now i've broken out the vaccum cleaner and the dust rags.  i've rearranged the living room and added a few new accessories.  and now it looks like a whole new room and i'm excited about it again.  i guess that's what i did for my outlook: dusted it off, rearranged the way i looked at it and now my life doesn't seem so haphazzard.  it's amazing how far i've come in a year and a half.  i'm proud of myself and excited again about being me.

      and yet again it's been (over) a week since i've updated this blog.  what happened?!  and now here i sit at work with  piles  of work to do and i'm going to update the blog...  so i'm so glad i joined  urlLink my gym .  i feel so much better about myself now that i'm not an inactive lump anymore.  i've pretty much sucessfully gotten there every other day.  and this week i started to take a kickboxing class that totally kicks my ass.  it's mon/wed/fri from 545 to 645 which means that i sort of have to waste time after work (or hell, stay late, it's not like i don't have shit to do and i  never  freaking get here on time in the morning) or get to the gym between 5 and 515 and find crap to do there while i wait for the class to start.  thus far i haven't had an issue with the class being full... i hope that doesn't become an issue...  anyway, the class totally kicks my butt and that's awesome.  i'm all sore and energized afterwards.  there's a class immediately after that from 645 to 7 that's an abs only class.  the first time i did these 2 classes it was taught by a tall instructor who was long and lean... you could definately tell that she does pilates  (i totally forgot to finish this or publish it from the other day...  i'll get back to this one at some point...)

      i suck.  i apparently cannot keep this blog updated anymore.    but i'm not giving up yet.  this week seemed to fly by... which rules.  i'm all unhappy at work right now.  i really need a new job.  i mean, i'm not like quitting anytime soon, but i'm sort of looking again.  i don't think i'm meant to work in an office every day of my life.  i need a job that'll give me something different every day... and one that'd give me a random weekday off every once in a while.  and it's not like i'm looking for anything prestigious either... just something to pay the bills.    beck thinks i should write a book.  i'm toying with the idea... i could definitely write a fun little  urlLink chic lit  book...  in fact, i have ideas for 2 books...  i'm thinking i'll give it a shot... i mean, what do i have to lose, right?  although, at the rate i'm going just trying to get myself to write on this blog who knows if i'll ever get a book done...    ...but i'm thinking about it...  it'd be extremely cool to have a book published...  i've recently become obsessed with bejeweld frames.  i've been obsessively going through my pictures trying to pick out which ones would look fabulous in what frames...  i'm even making a beaded frame out of an older frame that i had around the apartment that i didn't like.  i'm so crafty...    this weekend beck and i are going to go through the Europe pictures so beck can finalize her album.  i should get on my album (read: start one) as well...    well, that was a pretty pointless post.  this is why i haven't been posting lately.  i've been too scattered and busy to come up with something coherent...  ah well...  calmer days will be here again someday, right?

      you know, i really try hard to not be in a bad mood.  ok, well normally it's not such a struggle.  i don't like to be in a bad mood because it just perpetuates grumpiness and makes the people around you annoyed and not want to be around you.  i  hate being pissy.    so even though i started the day in a pissy mood i'm not in one anymore...  i decided that bad moods suck and i didn't want to be in one.  so i'm not.  i think i'm remarkable for being able to do that...  and a little obnoxious i guess...  anyway...    i think i had a point when i started this post at about 9 o'clock this morning... but now that it's over 6 hours later i totally forgot what that might have been...    well that was random and pointless...

      apparently i've decided to become fat again.  i got home from work (after convincing myself again to skip the gym) and decided that it was a better idea to read  Confessions of a Shopoholic  than to do the dishes right away.  so i read.  and then i was a little hungry so i ate a leftover eggroll.  and then i read some more.  and then i felt bad about not having done the dishes so i wondered into the kitchen... and decided i was still hungry so i ate the other leftover eggroll.  i haven't been to the gym in over a week now and i've been eating like a complete pig.  in fact, monday night i was uncomfortable because i'd eaten so much and i think i could actually feel my stomach expanding.  i'm ridiculous.  i was going to be better starting today but then i had a package of peanut butter crackers, a bagel with cream cheese, a small mocha mint latte, a Chinese chicken and veggies smart ones and a package of Swedish fish.  i won't be in that bad shape if i don't really eat after the gym tonight.  but knowing how i've been lately i'll probably go home and have about five handfuls of peanut butter m&m's and probably more leftover Chinese food.  i suck.  anyway.  back to last night.  so after i decided to eat the second egg roll i went back to the living room (because doing the dishes seemed too overwhelming) and i played the Sims on PS2 for about an hour and a half before i switched it off and finished my book and then watched Queer Eye and passed out on the sofa.  i woke up at about 3:30 and wondered into bed and was irrationally afraid of ghosts for some reason.  being awake and alone at 3:30am is kind of scary.  anyway.  that was awful.  i've been so bad lately.  but i am definitely going to the gym tonight and hopefully it will be the start of my getting back on track...  hopefully.  i really don't want to be fat again...

      so the weekend was good.    Went out with Alex on Friday, hung out with Beck and Dodi on Saturday (took Dodi to lunch for her birthday and went shopping) and later Beck and I went with Carrie to  urlLink sage's  production of  Noises Off , which Meredith's husband was in.  Then Beck and I hung out with Kevin and his friend Aaron at the Hill Street Cafe.    Sunday I had to work the  urlLink NYS Trooper  testing (hey, you can sign up online to take the test in march right now...).  Afterwards Beck and I met Dodi at the Pier One that her sister works at because they were having their friends and family day where you can get the employee discount of your friend/family member that works there.  i got a couple of sconces for my living room wall...  i've been looking for some for a while and these were only $12 each plus 30% off.  so rock.  I also bought a couple of paper lanterns (one to hang in my porch... looks awesome... and one to go above my table in my "dining" room) which were hella cheap.  so rock!  Beck and I swapped Europe photos (well, i acquired some of her doubles and now i've got to get some of my pics printed for her).  Alex came with me to dinner at my parents house later that night.  Mom made "asian pork" which had a spicy sauce but the pork itself was very yummy...  i think alex was nervous about coming to my parents house which was very cute because my parents are so harmless (well, dad is when he wants to be, and he was behaving last night).    Anyway, it was a good weekend.    still planning on writing a book.  rock.  i'm gonna be so cool.  then i'll get a weekly column in a major newspaper and be so Carrie from  Sex And The City .  only i won't spend all my money on shoes.  (i'll spend it all on crap for my house).  so sad to be at work.  it's raining and all i want to do is go home and crawl under my covers.  awesome.  but i can't do that until like 7:30 tonight because i'm going to my kickboxing class after work and i won't get done at the gym until 7.  sigh.  i need to not work here anymore.  i think i write that in every post.  i should probably do something about it one of these days...  but now it's back to work :(

       "Is that your underwear in the kitchen?"  i was sitting at my cubicle and my stomach started growling at me so i decided to feed it.  so i grabbed my potato from my price chopper bag and decided to forgo putting my sneakers back on (who can sit at their desk with shoes on?) and just run into the kitchen and pop the potato in the microwave.  i threw it in the microwave and set it for 8 minutes on high.  i padded out of the kitchen (i know, it's gross to walk around an office without shoes on, but whatever).    Meredith got up from her cube shortly after i sat down to go get her lunch ready.  she came back from the kitchen complaining that i was hogging the microwave because there was still 5 minutes left on the timer.  then she said, "is that your underwear in the kitchen?"  we (Carrie, Danielle, and I... the boys in the claims department were all out to lunch at the time) were all shocked at the question and questioned whether there was really underwear in the kitchen and she said that there was a pair in there sitting in the middle of the floor and she didn't realize what they were at first but when she did she kicked them in a corner.  we all laughed a bit about there being underwear in the corner of the kitchen and i said that maybe they were stuck in someone's pant leg and it's embarrassing when shit like that happens.  i didn't remember seeing underwear there so i asked her what they looked like.  she said they were blue with some sort of pattern on it and they looked like they were string bikinis.       and then i slowly came to the horrific realization that the underwear in the kitchen was mine.  i was wearing the jeans that i wore last night after work today.  and at the end of the night i'd quickly taken everything (jeans, socks,  underwear ) at the same time and threw the jeans on the floor.  this morning when i put the jeans on (always in a hurry) i remember a sock fell out of one pant leg.  i didn't expect anything more to be in the pants because i saw the other sock on the floor...  my face burned red as i realized that my underwear from yesterday had hitched a ride in my jeans and gotten loose in the kitchen at work.  now, a smart person wouldn't have said anything.    "oh my god i think those  are  my underwear!"  i blurted out.  everyone looked a little horrified but collapsed into laughter immediately and i ran down the hall towards the kitchen laughing hysterically to check and see if it was, indeed, my underwear on the kitchen floor.  i just about ran in the kitchen when i realized that two of my male coworkers, keith and john, were in the kitchen eating lunch.  i ran halfway back to our cubes and stage whispered to meredith, carrie, and danielle that keith and john were in there and then i sort of composed myself and walked into the kitchen to pick up my potato from the microwave (and check to see if the underwear in the corner was mine).  i casually walked over to the microwave (shaking with silent laughter) took my potato out and placed it on a plate and turned to leave.  when i turned around i saw my underwear sitting in the corner.  i started to get a little hysterical again and kept gasping for breaths between bouts of hysterical giggles and i guess it sounded like i was crying because john asked me if i was ok.  i managed to tell him that i was just laughing and i scooted out of the kitchen and back into my cube where i continued to laugh so hard until i couldn't breathe and my sides hurt.    the kitchen had filled up with people eating their lunches and so there was no way i was going to go back in there and pick up the underwear.  no one had discovered it yet, so i was planning on waiting it out and sneaking in when everyone left and then i'd grab the renegade underwear.  we all sat in our cubes and tried to get work done or eat our lunches but we kept giggling.  and then suddenly there was a loud sound coming from the kitchen.  they'd discovered my underwear.  apparently peggy, the support services supervisor, had come into the kitchen and was talking with the lunchers and saw the underwear in the corner.  not knowing what it was, she picked it up and when she realized what she had in her hands she threw them out.  at least it was taken care of.  and at least those were clearance underwear to begin with.  (seriously, i'm so glad it wasn't a thong... but i wish they'd been cuter underwear... those were kind of everyday run of the mill underwear...  just cotton...  well, they were leopard print...  but they were blue and not even low cut or anything...)   shit like that seriously only happens to me.  and this is why i need to write a sitcom.  or a book. well, when i fictionalize it, it'll have a better ending anyway.  also, it's kind of ironic that in the post below from this morning i wrote about how i need to be more interesting...  (oh, and as a post script, peggy came over and was talking to michael about the found underwear because he was in there when she found them and they didn't know that it was mine and he described the underwear as very "custom"...  what in the world does that mean?)

      i was just reading my posts from last year at this time and i've come to the conclusion that i was a lot more interesting a year ago.  i need to fix that...  i really love that i've kept this site up for so long and i can go back and read about what i was thinking/feeling/doing since april '02.  awesome.  i left the house in a hurry this morning (when don't i, actually?) and had nothing to bring for breakfast.  most mornings i bring breakfast food and eat it out of habit but am never actually all that hungry for it.  today i am starving.  i found an apple in one of my desk drawers (not as gross as it sounds... i stuck it in there last week i think) and ate that around 9 but was completely unsatiated.  finally, at about 1015 i couldn't stand it anymore and ran out and bought a sesame bagel at  urlLink bruegger's .  it was awesome, but it still didn't fill me up.  i feel like i have a tapeworm or something...  i'm totally going to eat my lunch (a salad and a baked potato) right at noon and i know i'll be starving again by lunch.  i hate days like this.  so i did go to  urlLink the gym  wednesday night.  i whined about it the entire time i was on my way and almost skipped it...  but i went.  and it was awesome.  wednesday night kickboxing class is taught by Tina, and she's pretty tough.  she had a new combination for us, "the killer", and it really lived up to its name.  we had to start in a straightforward lunge and then jump and "explode" into a lunge on the other leg.  it hurt, so very much.  my butt still kills.  i think tonight's class is taught by Linda, and she's even tougher than Tina, so I'm a little afraid and excited for class tonight.  rock.  i'm totally rocking this getting to the gym thing.  now i need to start rocking the eating better thing.    i'm totally cooking dinner tonight.  i'm going to make  urlLink stuffed pork chops and cream cheese mashed potatos and sugar snap peas .  it's a  urlLink rachel ray  recipe.  i need to stop at the store after the gym on the way home and pick up bacon and corn muffins.  i am going to rock tonight.  alex is coming over and i invited beck but it sounds like she might not come.  dammit.  i need everyone to know how much i rock in the kitchen.

       on being lucky...  I am the luckiest freaking girl ever.   Ok, that's an exaggeration.  But I really am lucky...  And I've stopped feeling guilty about the  urlLink BNL  tickets because apparently it was fate or luck or something (call it fate... call it luck... call it karma) that I got the tickets.  I was just informed by Dan-that-works-with-me that his girlfriend just bought four tickets to the show on eBay because she couldn't get 4 together off of ticketmaster for like $300.  And I only paid face value of $33 a piece for my two orchestra seats.  I couldn't believe that I'd got tickets and apparently they were so hard to get.  I just randomly thought to look yesterday... A week or two ago the only tickets left were balcony tickets (which is why I didn't buy them).  Mine must have just gotten released or something, because I just looked today and there were no tickets available.  I am even more excited now.  Rock!!    Ok back (?) to work.  And listening to BNL.  Rock!  I'm so excited!!

       on goals...  My goals for this week:  1) Eat less junk food. 2) Cook dinner every night instead of going out and bring the leftovers for lunch the next day. 3) Go to the gym for every kickboxing class this week. 4) Spend less money. 5) Be productive at work.  How I've done so far: 1) I suck.  Don't ask... 2) I cooked Monday night: Seafood Tomato Alfredo.  I got the recipe from the coupon flyers in the Sunday paper.  Seemed simple enough, but it called for using fish in it and I'm not a huge fish fan.  I decided to throw in some crab meat and tiny shrimp and I debated just leaving out the fish but I went for it.  I should have left out the fish.  It would have been excellent if there wasn't any fish in it...  Alex and I ate around the fish but he advised that perhaps I should stick to recipes from a cookbook rather than the coupon section of the paper.  I hate fish. 3) I did drag myself to kickboxing Monday.  And I was very happy afterwards that I went.  I'm going tonight as well, and I know I'll go Friday.  This goal is not so hard to achieve...  I feel  so  awesome after I go... 4) Very poor...  I just bought  urlLink Barenaked Ladies  tickets yesterday.  The concert's next Tuesday and I  so  cannot wait but I felt all guilty after I bought them and told Beck and she responded, "I thought you were trying to save money."   5) Extremely poor.  I haven't done anything at work all week.  It's because I hate it here.  I'm going to work on my resume tonight and start applying to new jobs.  I will not just sit idlely and complain anymore.  I will do something about it.  And in the meantime I will stop goofing off and start attacking some of these piles and become a model employee before I get the hell out of here (so that means I must stop typing and start working...).

      So I absolutely hate my job.  Other than working with Carrie and Meredith, I can't really think of one redeeming quality about this job.  So I really have to find something else.  But my problem is I'm really picky.  I mean, I guess it wouldn't be too hard to find another job.  The hard part would be to find another job that I like.  I do not want another desk job.    Ugh.  I need to just suck it up and own it and do this job while I'm here.  SUCK.

       "The Albanians are rowdy tonight"  So the  urlLink BNL  concert last night rocked.  Awesome.  I finally got through the day at work and went home and watched TV for a bit until Alex met me there.  We decided to grab some dinner downtown near the theater before the show started.  We drove down and parked near  urlLink McGeary's  and decided to run and pick up the tickets from the box office first and then go back to McGeary's and have some dinner.  The tickets were picked up without problem but when we got into McGeary's the crowd was so thick it was obvious there was no way we could have dinner there.  We retreated and headed to the Big House and had dinner there.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and two burgers (mine with Swiss and mushrooms and alex's pretty much plain).  We waited forever.  After a half hour our burgers sort of came.  A guy (not our waitress) was wondering around from table to table with two baskets and he finally came to our table and said, "I think these are yours... Swiss?" and put the burgers down in front of us.  Mine was a little too rare and Alex's had cheese and mushrooms on it but we decided that since it took forever to get the burgers to us and we needed to get to the concert.  About two minutes later the guy came back with a plate of bacon and gave it to Alex saying, "here, I forgot your bacon."  We both kind of looked at the bacon and Alex plopped it on his burger.  A few minutes later the waitress came to get us another round and we asked about our spinach dip and she brought that out with the next round.  I'm so glad we bothered to ask for that because it was  excellent .  At the end of the meal the waitress brought the check and she deducted one round of drinks and the spinach dip because the service was so poor which was really smart of her because then we ended up leaving her a pretty big tip.    We walked over to the  urlLink palace  and found our seats just before the concert started.  The seats were pretty excellent...  The theater isn't all that big and we were on the orchestra level just underneath where the balcony started.  So we were close enough that they looked like real people up on stage.  They started energetic as always bursting into one of the songs off their new album (which I, for some reason, can't remember right now which it was).  Ed played the first song shirtless and the combination of the random mohawk style of his hair and his tattooed (and pretty buff looking) upper body made him look like a Red Hot Chili Pepper.  The lights went black after they finished the first song and they immediately went into "Maybe Katie", also off the new album (with Ed newly shirted).  After the second song they chatted for a bit (and they explained that Tyler had told Ed he'd give him $100 if he played the first song shirtless) and then it was back to the music.  As ever they did a couple of spontaneous rap-like numbers where they made it up as they went along, this time Ed saying he'd "take that hundred dollars and turn it around" if one of the other guys in the band went pantless on stage.  During the question and answer section (which was really short) a fan asked if they had ever had a limbo contest in the band which they answered that they hadn't because they always assumed Jim would win and they spontaneously had a little limbo contest on stage between the band members.  Steve took over for Tyler on the drums and Tyler ran off stage for a second and came back in his boxer shorts to do the limbo, evening the score between him and Ed.  Providing percussion back up on stage and working the wireless mic in the orchestra section was "The Lord, God" (a guy dressed all in white with a white wig/beard) which was just entirely random.  They played everything off their new album (the one kind of low light of the night was when Steve was prefacing the rather serious song, "War On Drugs", which is about suicide with a short story about it and some idiots from the back started yelling for the song, "Alcohol") and a few of their very popular old songs (including "Old Apartment", "One Week", and "Brian Wilson").  The concert was about 2 and a half hours long and high energy the whole way.  Everyone stood for most of the show, sitting down only for the very slow songs (such as "War On Drugs").  There was a girl sitting in front of us who wouldn't sit all the way down in her seat and was blocking Alex's view half the time we were sitting which was kind of annoying.  She was a largeish girl and the back of her shirt said "Bid Night" which was unfortunate because we started to refer to her as "Big Night".  Large people should not wear words on the back of their shirts that can easily be turned into "big".    Anyway, so the concert was awesome!  :)      One odd thing: we met Alex's friend Joe and his fiancee, Kathy, during the intermission before.  Kathy and I had never met so when we were introduced she reached out and shook my hand.  Then she said that she was really sick and still contagious and shouldn't even be at the concert.  In fact, she had pink eye.  And she shook my hand.  All I could do was stare at my hand after I found that out.  The concert was about to start up again so there was no time to go wash my hands so I kept thinking, "don't touch your eye...  don't touch your eye..." as I sat back down.  People: when you have pink eye, don't shake people's hands.  I was doing no reaching... she reached out to shake my hand.  I'm not a hand shaker and only shook because she offered.  And she's an EMT!  She knows you should be limiting your contact with other people when you have such a communicable sickness!  I know I touched my eye that night before I got to wash my hands...  But I haven't developed pink eye yet so I guess I'm fine...  Still, it really skeeved me out...

       a little update...  So the weekend was good.  I had a little impromptu dinner party Friday night for myself, Alex, and Beck.  I made the  urlLink stuffed pork chop meal  I wrote about on Friday and it turned out pretty good.  Beck said she would be up around 8:30 and I said that I wouldn't need that much time, but I'm so glad she came then (well, even a little late).  Cooking takes a lot longer than the recipe indicates when you're new at it...  Also, I've got a bad habit of getting distracted with other things (dirty apartment) when I should be on task (cooking... started late).  When Alex showed up I think I only had the potatoes boiling...  I asked Alex to chop the onions for me and I got the pan started for the stuffing...  Started the stuffing and had Alex handle mashing the potatoes...  By the time Beck got there we'd burned the stuffing and started a new batch and were just waiting for the pork chops and sugar snap peas to finish cooking.  I pulled out my awesome red table and we broke it in that night (first time it was more than just me eating at the table...).  I set the table with my "good" placemats and lit candles and had two types of wine on hand.  The dinner was pretty good (potatoes were cold by the time we ate... damn...) and I was so impressed with the little dinner party :)  I did the test scheduling thing for NYS Department of Corrections Saturday morning and then went to a candle party at Carrie's place that evening.  I did the dishes from the night before in between while talking to my mom in Michigan (she always sounds so shocked when I call her).  The candle party was a good time and I actually got some Christmas shopping done so rock.  I can knock two people off my list, I am hella excited.  I went to my parents' house afterwards and hung out with my dad and my brother for a bit (we watched   urlLink Reno 911   on  urlLink Comedy Central ).  I went back to my apartment and then Alex came down and we went to see   urlLink Love Actually  .  I really enjoyed that movie...  It's not really a complete story but rather a bunch of vignettes...  I guess they could have come together a little better and it was a little long, but I enjoyed watching it.  There was this kid in it that was like the cutest thing ever.  He looked like he was about 8 but then he opened his mouth and started talking and he was so verbose... It was almost shocking...  He was just freaking adorable though.    I met Beck at the mall Sunday and we had lunch at Ruby Tuesdays and then Dodi met us and we walked around the mall for a bit.  I got some new work clothes at Lerner - including the outfit I'm wearing today: cream flare pants and a black v-neck sweater with an "A" on it.  It's really cute and I love the outfit but it's raining out and you know I'll probably get these pants all dirty right away...  And also Marc asked me if the "A" was for "adulteress" as in  The Scarlet Letter .  Someone told him that I couldn't be an adulteress because I wasn't married and I told him he was mean :)  Tonight I'm going to the  urlLink Barenaked Ladies  concert at the  urlLink Palace Theater .  I so cannot wait!  This day is taking forever (of course)...  I guess it would seem to go quicker if I actually did some work...

      so it's been two weeks since i've posted and that's just too long.  first off, i went to the doctor today and i had the nurse measure my height and it turns out that sans shoes i'm 5'8" and not 5'9" or close to 5'10" as i'd believed.  i'm shocked.  my world is shaken.  i guess i'm more overweight than i thought...  suck.  well, i vow that i will lose 20 lbs by march.  wish me luck.  (you know, i'm always complaining about being tall and now that i found out that i'm not as tall as i though, i'm kind of dissappointed....)  my apartment is a pigsty.  it's gross.  i'm disgusting.  i think i remember needing to clean last thanksgiving as well. must be something about this time of year that makes me lazy about keeping up with keeping clean.  so i did dishes last night and i'm doing wash now and i'm borrowing my parents'  urlLink Hoover Floormate  so that i can clean my filthass floors.  they said it works pretty good... i hope so.  as i said before, my place is such a pigsty right now.  ugh...    so speaking of the 'rents... the family left for texas on sunday.  i drove them to the airport and we were hanging out at the hosue beforehand when dad, who was in a pretty good mood and playing with the dog, jumped to kick greg's backpack and fell and hurt his ankle.  he was in major pain and amy and i helped him to the sofa and got ice packs and tea towels to keep the ice packs on and he said that it felt like he broke his leg or something but insisted that he didn't need anything else and that he'd think of something else and the pain would go away.  a couple of hours later he was helping to take the dog to the vet to be boarded while they were away and he seemed to be hobbling fine into the airport when i dropped them off.  i called amy the next day to see how the trip was and to discuss some christmas gifting plans and she told me that they'd been to the ER out in texas that morning and that dad had actually broken his ankle.  so my poor daddy is hobbling around texas on their thanksgiving vacation using crutches and with a splint on his foot.  he'll need to get a cast put on when he returns to new york and i guess he's got about 6 weeks of healing to look forward to.  i feel so bad for my dad!!!     sunday after i dropped my family off i headed back to my apartment and made plans to meet alex and steve at  urlLink revolution hall  to see the  urlLink glengarry bhoys .  alex and i had been there friday night to see  urlLink hair of the dog , which was the first time that either of us had been to that venue and we were pretty impressed.  there's a large stage and a bar along one wall with tables in the middle and benches around the edges and a second level with an open middle to view the stage.  it was glengarry's last show of the year sunday night and they did a great job, even without their fiddler, shelly, who apparently had a broken finger.   i'm going to  urlLink Malt River  in Latham tonight to see HOTD with Alex and Steve and possibly others.  i'm hoping it'll be a nice crowd, i love going out around Thanksgiving because pretty much everyone has time off and there are people home who aren't always home and it's a good time.  I'm hoping to not repeat the last time i was at malt river to see HOTD...  that was the infamous 'buka and aftershock night that still makes me want to puke thinking about it.    speaking of wanting to puke...  there's a scrape on my car that makes me want to puke every time i look at it.  it happened friday night when alex was driving us home from Friday's (where we went for dinner after HOTD).  we'd both worked that day and were exhausted by the time we were at Friday's (literally falling asleep in our food) and so we packed up our dinners and headed back to my apartment.  when he was turning from madison onto south main he went up over the curb a little and when he came back down i heard a scraping on my side of the car that i remember thinking, "oh i hope that's my mudflap!" (i have plastic mudflaps behind my rear wheels on my car).  i discovered later in the weekend it wasn't.  i didn't see the scrape right away because it's kind of underneath the car and when you get in and out of the passenger side you're looking down from above and it's not obvious.  but when you look at the car from the side you can see it.  and it's horrible and ugly.  i had marc at work take a look at it and he said that for a shop to repair it it'll probably be about $200-250.  suck.  i'm taking it to dodi's dad's shop on tuesday for him to give me an estimate.  i hope it's not too much.  at least i'm getting a christmas bonus next week...    hmm...  what else...  oh, so i'm doing thanksgiving dinner at beck and alex's for any observant readers who noticed that my family went to texas without me and wondered what i was doing for thanksgiving.  it should be a good time.  i went out with meredith last week on a lunch break and picked out a bottle of pinot noir and i got a cute little wine cozy to gift it with so i can be a polite and proper guest... :)  well, the wash is finally done so it's time to head home and make plans for the evening...     Happy Thanksgiving!

       Oh all the money e'er I had, I spent it in good company...   good times.  so i was trying to think of a title for this post, and that opening line from "The Parting Glass" came to mind... it was between that and "Give Troy a Chance," Carrie's line of the day which could be Troy's new PR slogan (but she said don't go below third...  so I guess it's actually, "Give Troy a Chance but avoid going below third...").  SO the line from "The Parting Glass" won out because the last week was filled with good times with good friends and plenty of money spending.    Wednesday night found me and Alex and Steve at Malt River Brewing Company in the Latham Circle Mall watching  urlLink hair of the dog .  The show started a little later than normal (I guess they had to wait for the mall to close) and they did three sets, so by the end of the night there were few of us left.  But it was a good time (HOTD always is a good time...).  Thanksgiving dinner was really great.  :)  I was a little nervous about going to Beck and Alex's house for dinner because I felt like an orphan.  I dunno, holidays are so... family and tradition... I didn't want to "mess" things up.  But they made me completely comfortable and the dinner was excellent and I ended up having an excellent time.  So rock.  :)  Beck, Kevin (who came for dessert), Alex and I went to the bowling alley 'cause Dodi invited us to meet her and her family there (they go every year after Thanksgiving dinner).  We ended up getting a lane next to Dodi's and bowled two games.  And it was so surprisingly cheap!  It was only $20 for the four of us for shoe rentals and 2 games of bowling.  Rock!  Afterwards we played in the arcade for a while... Beck and I played  urlLink ddr  and Alex and Kevin played some racing game where your seat moves and rumbles along with the game.  It was awesome to move around so much after having eaten so much Thanksgiving dinner earlier.    Friday I went shopping with Beck and Dodi at Crossgates.  Being out in the Black Friday throngs was awesome.  I didn't get any shopping done, but it was fun...  I picked up the family at the airport and then continued the shopping.  The only thing I bought was a new Christmas tree at Wal-Mart (had to get a new one because one of the cats [most likely Molly] peed on the tree from last year).  It was still a cheap one (only $24.95) but it looks pretty full and cute.  I went to hang out with the parents for a little bit after shopping but left after about an hour to go hang out with Eric who was home for the holiday.  Ryan soon joined us and we hung out watching TV and playing PS2.  I left much later than I expected and wasn't to bed 'till about 2:30am...    Saturday morning I got up and had a quick bowl of cereal and began cleaning.  I cleaned my apartment from about 10am till about 3:30pm.  It was a dirty, filthy mess.  But by the end it was sparkling and lovely.  I met Dodi at the mall for a bit and came home wiht some new bubble lights for my tree and a retro glass tree topper (and some assorted other items).  I started to take my new tree out of its box but before long it was time to go with Alex to  urlLink McGeary's  to see HOTD.  It was an awesome show.  (ok, i'm biased, i always think it's an awesome show).  I was drinking flavored vodkas and tonic (started with raspberry vodka at home while I was unpacking the tree and moved to orange at the pub...  orange is better...) and I got drunk pretty quick.  There was much bathroom eventage that night.  The first time I stumbled to the line for the girls room the chick behind me was like, we should go in the men's room and when a guy came out she asked if there was anyone else in there.  He looked in and confirmed it was all clear and the chick and I went in.  She said I could go ahead and use the stall first, so I did, and when I came out she'd abandoned me.  Annoying.  So I had to leave the men's room alone, which was a little odd, but I owned it (I did get weird looks though).  After watching the band more and having a few more lovely little drinks I needed to vist the bathroom again...  I went to the bathroom on the way to get some more beverages and dropped my phone while I was in there and didn't realize it until some other girl gave me half my phone.  After I retrieved the battery I found my way back to Alex and told him that we needed to leave because I was way too drunk and didn't want to drink anymore (it was at least halfway through the last set anyways...).  We left and went to the 76 Diner (established in 74, actually... odd...) for dinner/breakfast/snack/middle-of-the-night-food whatever you want to call it.  Yes, it was a good night. :)  Sunday morning Alex and I cooked a big brunch of French toast and potatoes and sausage.  Alex was in charge of the potatoes and they rocked.  He added some pinot grigio I had left from the other night and they were divine.  We put up the tree all afternoon (damn, that took forever) while watching a marathon of the fairly odd parents on Nickelodean.  Alex put the tree together a little differently than the directions said, which made me a little nervous, but it turned out great.  The tree looks awesome.  I posted some pics  urlLink here .  It's so cute!!!  Afterwards I headed up to Clifton Park for my family's Thanksgiving Observed Dinner, which was great and yielded leftovers that to feed me for three days.  Rock.  On the way home I met Dodi and we searched the stores for the perfect Christmas tree scented candles.  And we found them at Kohl's.  And they were cheap!  Awesome!  Soyeah, I got a cute Christmas tree scented jar candle for under $5 and another jar candle that smells  exactly  like a candy cane and a Christmas gift for someone and a little wooden santa head door hanging that says "welcome" for the front door to my apartment.  And now I'm so done decorating.  And I really have to get on the whole Christmas gift shopping thing because i've only got three people done and that's no good....  so... in other news, i'm back to work after my nice little holiday and that sucks.  but there's a new guy that started this week and he's got a lot of experience and my supervisor is making me give him some of my files and today i got rid of this one dog of a file that was such a mess and i couldn't even deal with it anymore and so i'm thinking that getting rid of that alone will make my whole attitude about the job improve.  i felt really bad about giving it to the new guy, but he's got so much experience with this stuff that i know he'll be able to do a much,  much  better job on it than i was...  also i got to move to a bigger cube (meredith's old cube... she switched departments) and i'm facing the wall instead of the "action" so hopefully i'll be able to be more focused at work.  the new guy seems pretty cool, too.  he said that HOTD is one of his favorite books, so that's awsome!  :)    Ugh.  Speaking of work...  i better go to bed...  i'm totally going to be late tomorrow...  suck.  it's so cold...

      so i totally suck at updating lately.  i guess updates will be weekly now...  or something.  so i hate snow.  i was at my parents house on Saturday morning when it was blizzarding because i was babysitting for them the night before.  i tried to do a good deed and take my brother to work a little before 1 and i couldn't get the bug up the street.  the plow hadn't come through yet, and the street was a mess with about 8 inches of snow on it.  i could back out of the driveway but got stuck when i tried to go forward, so the brother had to get out and push us back in the driveway.  finally, he just decided to screw the whole being driven thing and walk.  i can't believe he walked about a mile to work in the blizzarding snow.  i mean, it's only price chopper.  i know i would have called in.  i guess i'm impressed by his work ethic...  so at first i was all panicky that i was stuck at the parents house.  but then i took a nap and was happy to just sit around in the warm house and watch movies.  beck couldn't be at home anymore and was desperate for coffee so she dug her car out of her driveway and came and picked me up and we went to persnickety's for coffee.  i found a christmas gift for my mom there, and so some christmas shopping got done.  we decided to go to the dirt mall (clifton park center) and walk around when alex called and said that he was on his way up to my house to pick me up.  he's an excellent boyfriend... he knew that i was all sketchy about driving my car in the snow and that i didn't want to be stuck in the house all day so he offered to pick me up and we'd go Christmas shopping.  he rules.  we told him to meet us at the dirt mall and so the three of us walked around there for a bit and then Alex and i headed towards Albany.  First we stopped at my apartment to make sure the cats were ok.  the streets of albany were horrible and the snow drifts we had to climb over to get to the building were at above-the-knees level.  the cats were fine and we freshened their food and water and then headed to Crossgates to have dinner.  we did want to do some shopping as well, but all the stores were closing early because of the snow.  so we had dinner at Ruby Tuesday's and then saw  the last samurai  which from the previews i thought was going to blow, but was actually very good.  we headed up towards Clifton Park after the movie because there was no way we were going to brave the narrow, treacherous, streets of Albany again.  We went to TGIFridays in CP because no where else was open and had a few drinks.  And a fabulous time.  I really had a great day on Saturday...  Sunday the streets were pretty much all plowed in Clifton Park.  I met Beck at Target after dropping my little brother off at a birthday party and we hit a few stores in Clifton Park before we drove down to Circuit City in Albany.  We had lunch at Panera (right next door to Circuit City) and then we did some Christmas shopping next door.  We saw a few things we liked there, but ended up going to Sam's Club (around the corner) and buying them cheaper there.  Sam's Rules.  I was shopped out (shocking, i know!) and we headed back to CP.  I met Alex for coffee at Starbuck's and then we went to Chili's for dinner.  I stopped back home for a bit and then met Beck for coffee at Starbuck's (I had tea this time) and then went to K-Mart and got some snow boots (for climbing over the big snowpiles outside my apartment building) and a new tree skirt (because Molly, the little lovely kitty that she is, pooped on my other one).  I headed home and was pleasently surprised to find a spot pretty quickly.    work so far this week has been boring as usual.  this week is kind of busy for me.  i went to the gym monday after work and then went home to wallow in my filth.  i didn't feel like taking a shower or cooking so i brought boston market dinner home and sat around in my sweaty clothes and put myself to bed kind of early, at ten.  at eleven my phone was ringing and it was alex calling.  he worked late and was just leaving and wanted to come over.  he felt bad for having woke me up but i convinced him to come over anyway.  i felt like such a scummer having just sat around in my filth all night, but alex said that i was still cute, even if i was a mess.  we watched tv for a bit but i just pretty much was sleeping so i went to bed.  it was so cold in my aparmtment!    tuesday morning i went to work and was so jealous of alex who was still sleeping.  it was just too cold to be out of bed.  i had concentration issues yesterday at work (and apparently so far today as well, as i've pretty much just been working on this post and nothing else so far) and so the day seemed to drag.  I submitted my paperwork online to take the test in march to apply to become a  urlLink new york state trooper .  i take the test on march 27th...  wish me luck!  :)  Alex is going to be so proud of me for submitting those papers... he's been hounding me to do that ever since i expressed an interest in it.  i'm so glad he's been so supportive, i probably never would have got the nerve to do it without him.  i got home a little late last night after work because i stopped at the mall to do a little christmas shopping and was very pleasently surprised to find that Alex did my dishes for me.  seriously, he rules.  Meredith met me at the apartment and we went together to our first meeting of the  urlLink Ladies Order of the Ancient order of the Hibernians .  I was definitely the baby at the meeting, but we had a pretty good time.  it'll be nice to belong to something and have a chance to help other people out.    so that brings me to today.  i'm determined to get a lot of work done when i finally finsh this post.  i've gotten pretty much all my Christmas shopping done and so there's not that temptation to internet shop to distract me from work.  I'm going to the gym after work tonight.  i've decided that there can be no slacking there anymore now that i definitly am going to pursue the trooper thing and now that i'm in Carrie's wedding in July and want to look fabulous in my bridesmaid dress.  tomorrow night is my office's christmas party at the  urlLink barnsider , which is apparently a pretty decent restaraunt.  we get to bring guests for free so that rules.  it should be a good time.  Friday night is gym and then  urlLink HOTD  at  urlLink McGeary's  (awesome).  and then i'm hoping that this weekend Beck, Dodi, and I can go to see  urlLink  The Full Monty   the musical at  urlLink Proctors ... that'd rule.  :)    so enough posting and now it's time to work.

      I felt that today's horoscope was a bit harsh, but I guess the truth hurts:  Cancer It feels early for the bills to be coming in, but they're piling up anyway. Self-worth gets expensive when you have to go out and buy it. Consider an early New Year's resolution about reining in certain impulses.   Crap.

      So, so long since I've posted.  So I hope everyone had a merry Christmas or happy whatever holiday applies to you.    I finally finished all my shopping on Tuesday.  I rock.  I could have been done much earlier, but I really love shopping and I have no money to shop for myself so I prolonged the whole shopping for everyone else thing because it enabled me to still shop.  Yeah.    So I think all the gifts (so far) went over well.  I got my sister a sweater from Express that was very cute and she seemed to like it a lot and a copy of The Bad Girl's Guide to Getting What You Want because that book is just so hella cool.  I got my older-little-brother a compact DVD player for his room that I got a great deal on at Sam's Club.  I got the 10 year old brother a network adaptor for the PS2 so that he can play online and beat people around the world and I got the 8 year old brother SSX Tricky because he's so much better than me on SSX and I think that's hella cool.  I went in on gifts for the Wham and my dad with my brother and sister.  We got Dad a DVD-RW drive so that he can put his home movies on DVDs, and we got the Wham a new digital camera because the other one that she had sucked.  They were both really happy with their gifts, so that rocked.    Beck, Dodi, and I exchanged gifts last Friday night.  I cooked us dinner: Penne alla Vodka with chicken, crusty Italian bread, a salad (with croutons for Dodi), and cosmopolitan (which, at first I made too strong, because I have this issue with making drinks to strong, but then I added more cranberry juice and they were excellent).  Dinner was pretty good, if I do say so myself, and we had a great time sitting around, sipping on our cosmos and watching Sex and the City.  Beck and I gave Dodi a pair of sun and moon wall sciences and a new duvet cover for her recently acquired down comforter.  I gave Beck the 5th season of Sex and the City (well, I preordered it for her, so I gave her a DVD case with a cover that I made that said that it was coming to her soon) and a set from Bath and Body works that had salt "flavored" lotions in it.  I got a very cool wall calendar from Dodi that has vintage advertising posters in it (matches perfectly in my kitchen/dining area) and a set of coasters from the Pottery Barn that are glass with vintage liquor advertising art on them.  Very cool.  I got a pair of Chinese silk slippers from Beck, along with a "Dancing Diva" for my car, some maple syrup and maple sugar candies (seriously, my favorite thing in the world), a pooping reindeer that "poops" brown jelly beans, and this awesome book called  The S Factor  that has workouts in it based on stripper moves.  I'd totally like to take a class, but I don't think there are any around here, so the book is awesome.    I haven't yet exchanged gifts with Alex.  We were going to on Christmas Eve, but we didn't have time.  He had to come over to the apartment after he got out of work at 6 to pick up the TV that he and Beck bought for their parents.  He wanted to exchange gifts then, but my family always exchanges our gifts to each other on Christmas Eve (and then we open our gifts from "Santa" the next day) and so I had to get home by like 7:30 or so or else my little brothers would go crazy.  So we wouldn't have time to do a Christmas thing for the two of us then.  As it was, Alex got out of work late and didn't get to my apartment until almost 7, so I didn't get to my house until 8 and my brothers pretty much attacked when I got in the door and started asking to open gifts.  And then Alex and I couldn't get together on Christmas.  He and I both did the family thing with our respective families during the day, and he wasn't able to drive down to the apartment that night because his taillights aren't working on his car so it's not safe for him to drive at night.  We both had to work the next morning, and so my going to pick him up wouldn't have made sense either, so we're going to do Christmas tonight.    I had a very nice Christmas with my family.  My sibling bought me some nice gifts: my sister bought me a fleece sweater, which at first I wasn't sure that I liked, but I tried it on and it looks very nice and it's the perfect in between jacket and I didn't have anything besides hoodies that fit that bill, so it's really an excellent gift.  My brother bought me a new controller for my PS2, which is awesome because I only had one controller before and now I'll be able to play with other people, so it's not just "playsterbation" as Eric referred to it.  My 10 year old brother got me the Sims Vacation expansion pack, which I didn't' have.  He's so observant... I didn't even mention that I wanted that, but he knows from watching commercials with me that I like the Sims and he wanted to get Bustin' Out for me but they couldn't find it, so he got me that expansion pack instead.  He's a sweetie.  My youngest brother gave me a shiny red compact mirror with an "A" in rhinestones on the front which is exactly my taste and very sweet.    I got some nice things from Santa as well.  Santa gave me a new set of knifes, which I really needed because the knifes I bought myself when I first moved out suck immensely.  My new knifes are very sharp and I know that because I've already cut myself.  I also got a large wood cutting board from Santa, which I didn't even think of asking for, but my other cutting board was very small, and this is excellent.  It has a gripper thing that pokes into the back of what your cutting and holds it still, which is awesome because I'm retarded at cutting and can use all the help I can get.  Santa also brought me the  Pirates of the Caribbean  DVD, which is excellent because I  love  that movie and really wanted that DVD.  I got a couple of very cute jeweled frames and some Bath and Body Works lotion/shower gel in Mango Mandarin "flavor" which is  excellent  from Santa.   Santa really equipped me for entertaining: he gave me a bar set, a wine set (corkscrew, collar, pourer, and bottle stopper), and a chip and dip set.  I guess I'll have to have a party now...  :)  Santa also gave me a $75 gift certificate to Best Buy... and I'm not sure what I'm going to buy with it yet, but I'm very excited...  I'm thinking I might get a new entertainment center or perhaps a whole fleet of new DVDs...    So yes.  It was a very nice Christmas.  We did the gift thing from Santa in the morning and then we went to Church.  We had Father Lanice, which was sucky because he's kind of long-winded.  But his homily was broken up by the fire alarm going off in the middle of his homily.  It was so loud and annoying and it took five minutes to get it turned off, but the congregation waited patiently and applauded when it stopped and luckily it was only a local alarm so we didn't have the fire department showing up.  Father Lanice said that he'd lost his train of thought and the congregation spontaneously broke out in applause again...  Father took the hint and cut the rest of his homily short.  After church we hung out around the house.  My brother got  urlLink Ghettopoly  for Christmas and he and my sister and I played it for a few hours.  I got beat hardcore.  And it was going so well for so long.  Ah well.  We had dinner around 5 (ham, garlic mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, corn, and non-burnt-for-a-change rolls) and I headed back to the apartment around 6:30.  I realized when I got back to my place that I left way too early because I had nothing to do for the rest of the night and my plans for baking were foiled because I had no butter.  I got depressed and was saved by Eric calling.  He's home for a bit and he came up to hang out with me.  We both realized on his way up that I have two cats and he has severe allergies, so after he came in and viewed the tree, we went to a bar that's pretty much down the street and hung out and had a drink.  Eric bought me a Christmas pint, and it's been so long since I had a Guinness and it was so, so good.    I'm at work now.  The day after Christmas, a Friday, and they didn't close our office.  And I couldn't get the day off because other people had already requested the day.  So that sucks.  A lot.  It's almost noon and I've been here since 8 (ok, well, 8:15) and I haven't had any phone calls today.  This is pointless.  I'm so irritated that we're open.  I was so angry when I first got here that I really couldn't talk to anyone.  But I've calmed down.  Carrie's here this morning and she's leaving at noon to drive to Newark and catch a plane to Scotland.  I'm so happy for her that today is finally here and she gets to go to Scotland and be with John.  And she'll come back officially engaged.  :)  She's been rushing around and being a model employee getting stuff done (while I've been sitting here pretty much not getting much done at all and typing this post) and she stapled her finger.  She's so funny, because she only really got a small little puncture wound, but she stuck her finger right up above her head, like she was going to bleed out if she didn't keep her finger above her heart.  I went into the kitchen to find a band-aide, but we apparently ran out of them.  I brought back some disinfectant wipes and triple antibiotic ointment and opened them up for her to apply and then went to Mary Ellen's desk and found her small first aide kit and grabbed a band-aide out of it.  I opened it up and stuck it on her finger for her.  Andy made fun of me... he was like, "woah, way to take charge, I didn't know you had paramedic training."  And I was thinking, I don't know about paramedic training, but I think I've had "mom training" from watching the Wham all these years.  So that was my excitement for the morning.  Now I've got 5 hours left today and no motivation to do anything.  I guess I should try and keep busy so the day seems to go quicker.  So yeah.  I'll get to work.    Probably won't update again until next week...  I'm going to PA this weekend to see my Mom and her family as she's down there from MI for Christmas.  Alex is able to go with me, so that should make the trip more bearable.  The road-trip part of it should be fun, at least.  :) We come back up Sunday then it's back to work for Mon/Tue/Wed.  I'm not sure what I'm doing New Year's Eve.  Alex has to work a 24 that day, so that blows.  Beck said she might be going with Kevin to Boston, and Dodi may or may not end up staying in with Tristan.  I'd love if we could all go out to like the Big House or something dancing.  That'd rock.  I hope I just don't end up sitting alone in my apartment...  or at home with my parents...  I guess if nothing ends up happening for New Year's, maybe I'll try and have a little get together at my apartment the following Friday and I can use my new entertaining stuff...  :)  Anywho.  Yeah.  So.  Happy Holidays.  I gotta get back to work...

      So I was talking to my sister because I was bored and my Aunt Cathy was up visiting and she suggested that I cure my boredom with Blogging and I think I will...  The weekend was good.  I made it through the day at work on Friday.  The day lasted five years until I got out of work, and then the evening flew by.  I got home from work and was going around lighting candles because Molly had obviously just made a deposit in the litter box when my buzzer rang.  I wasn't expecting anyone right away, so instead of just buzzing whoever was at the door in, I took a peek outside and found Beck and Dodi standing in the front hall waiting to be let in.  I let them in and we hung out for a bit in the living room telling each other about our Christmases.  Beck informed me that Alex was offered an extra four hours at work, so he'd be working until at least six and then would have to go home and try and fix the taillight on his car before he'd be able to come up so they invited me to dinner at Friday's.    We had bad luck at Friday's...  We were buzzed in to get seated only to find that they weren't ready for us yet and so we had to stand in everyone's way while they searched out a table for us.  Then our waitress apparently forgot to put our food order in because it took  forever  to get our dinners, which was very strange because we all got simple items: I got a baked potato and soup, Beck got a salad, and Dodi got chicken strips.  There were two girls at the table next to us who were celebrating a birthday but were strange because they kept giving us evil looks.  When the restaurant crew sang happy birthday it was extremely difficult to not laugh.  They sang the traditional birthday song, but at the end of each verse they'd yell out the birthday girl's name.  But none of them seemed into singing, so it sounded like a bunch of extremely unenthusiastic people singing, "Happy Birthday to you...   Julie !  Happy Birthday to you...  Julie !"  It was too funny.  So yeah.  So we had a good time at dinner and afterwards Dodi drove Beck home and I headed back to the apartment.    So I got to the apartment and immediately started to bake.  I'd planned on making the last of the cookies I needed to fill in my little gift boxes to bring to my family in PA as soon as I got home from work so that I wouldn't have to be doing it when Alex came over.  But I happily had other distractions, so the baking needed to be done immediately upon my arrival back to the apartment because it was already after 8 and I didn't want to be baking all night.  I made integrated chocolate chip cookies, because I had all the ingredients to make Toll House Cookies (the only kind I can't screw up) but I only had a half bag each of white and dark chocolate chips.  So I decided to just go with it and have politically correct cookies.  The cookie making commenced and aside from a few frustrating moments with my hand mixer went smoothly.  The cookies came out pretty darn good, if I do say so myself.    Alex called as I was finishing up with the cookies, around 10.  I was pissed.  I mean, no one should be kept waiting until 10 when the plan was to meet up after work.  He'd worked late and then went home to work on his car only to find that he wasn't able to fix the taillights so he wouldn't be able to drive down after all.  I got upset and let him know that he should have called me earlier.  He pointed out that I hadn't called either.  Ok, I admit, I could have called.  But I was being a girl and playing that game where you don't call because you want them to call because you want to know that they would call you if you didn't call them.  But that wasn't the point.  He apologized for not calling earlier and I said that I'd come down and pick him up even though it was late because I didn't want to have to do it in the morning before we left for PA (and also I really wanted to do Christmas with him).    So we did Christmas when we got back to the apartment.  Alex really seemed excited about the Game Cube.  So that rocks.  I love when a gift goes over well!  :)  Alex gave me this very cool Guinness mirror (just like in pubs!) that I plan on hanging above my liquor cabinet (as soon as I get one... I have the spot in my apartment all picked out) and a Guinness pint glass with candle poured in to look like a Guinness.  I stuck it on my one side table in the living room next to a picture of Beck and me at the Guinness Storehouse Gravity Bar holding our pints of Guinness.  It's perfect!  I totally needed a candle to go on that table, and that one is just too cool and fits right in there.  Alex wanted me to light it right away, but I like it too much!  I don't want the candle to go away!  He also got me the  Indiana Jones  boxed set, which is extremely cool.  All three movies plus a bonus disk of extra material.  We put  Raiders of the Lost Arc  in right away (but fell asleep while it was on and woke up at 2am to hear the theme music blasting because it had played through the movie and returned to the main screen...  I felt bad because I bet my neighbors could totally hear that playing for like an hour at least...).  He did excellently with gifts for me!  :)  He rocks.    So the next morning we got a late start and then decided to go to Quintessense for breakfast so we didn't get on the road until about 11.  But the ride was a lot of fun and the weather was perfect so the 4 hour ride was over before we knew it.  We arrived at my Aunt Karen's house in Pottsville around 3.  We hung out for a bit with my Mom and RJ.  We took a ride with them in my Mom's new Chrysler Pacifica up to the mall and then to Wal-Mart to pick up salad greens before we headed back to Karen's for dinner.  Everyone was there: Karen and Bobby and Sherry (of course... Ryan wasn't there though, he was out...), Nana and PopPop, Aunt Denise and her husband Bob and their sons Ian and Evan, Aunt Diane and her husband Joe and their kids: Zach, Jacob, Rachel, and Sarah, Mom and RJ and Alex and me.  It was a full house.  We had dinner and did the gift thing and chatted and I was exhausted by the time everyone left.  Alex was tired too, and we sat on the sofa and watched "Boomtown" and then talked a bit with Mom and RJ and Karen and Bobby before everyone headed off to bed.  Alex and I were just about to turn in when my cousin Ryan came in.  We talked for a bit about his new car, a  urlLink 2003 20th anniversary edition VW GTI .  It's so very cute.  A 180hp six speed with lowered sport suspension and stock 18" alloy wheels.  So very sweet.  They only made 4200 of them, and 200 went to Canada and 4000 came to the US.  His is number 3070.  It's "jazz blue."  So awesome.  So we were talking about the car for a bit then Ryan decided that he was hungry so he said that he was going to "Hit Sheetz."  We thought he meant "go to bed" but apparently Sheetz is a convenience store that's open 24h.  So he left, and when he came back he threw a wrapped sandwich in front of us and said, "here's a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit if you want it.  I just hit a deer."  I was like, "Oh my God!  Are you ok?" and he said, "yeah, but my car's not."  It was so sad.  I saw the car the next day when we were leaving.  If it was my car, I would be in tears.  I mean, he's only had the thing for 3 months, and we were just talking about how awesome it was, and then some buck jumps out onto his hood...  Here's a picture that I took with my phone's camera attachment:        So yeah.  That sucked, but at least he wasn't hurt or anything.  And Marc, our in-house appraiser at work, said that it didn't actually look too bad.  So Alex and I left by 12:30 the next afternoon because Alex had to be back to ride with the Ambulance in Clifton Park that evening.  We had an awesome ride back and stopped at Dobb's Country Kitchen in Great Bend, PA for a late lunch/early dinner.  My family used to stop there all the time on our trips to PA, so it was fun to go back there and have an open-faced hot turkey sandwich with fries and gravy all over it like I used to get.  The road trip was so enjoyable, that I was kind of sad when it was over...  We got to Clifton Park around 6:30 after a quick stop at the apartment so Alex could help me unload my stuff and pick up his Game Cube.  I decided to get my laundry done since I had to drive up to CP anyway, and ended up watching  Final Destination  with my brothers while I was doing the laundry and I wanted to stay until the end because I'd never seen it before and left much later than I wanted to and didn't get to bed until midnight.  I completely overslept this morning and was ass-tired at work.  I was going to go up to CP to hang out with Dodi, but I didn't feel like driving anymore and just came home to the apartment and now I'm sitting here in my pretty flannel jammies from Vicki's.  I would have gone up to CP had I known that my Aunt Cathy was up...  Ah well.  My sister and Eric and Ryan are possibly going to come over and we'll watch  Indiana Jones  or  Donnie Darko  and play The Game of Life.  I'm so excited to just have a quiet night in.  Does that make me old?  The family is coming up tomorrow evening to hang out and view my tree.  Dad said that he wants hors d'oeuvres...  I hope they bring them, 'cause I've got no food and no money to buy any either.  Not until Wednesday when I get paid.  I'm thankful that I'm getting paid Wed, because that means that I can go out to the Macaroni Grill and possibly The Big House or Jillian's with Dodi and Tristan and possibly her cousin and her boyfriend and Beck and Kevin and possibly their friend, Dave.  That seems to be the tentative plan right now.  I hope it works out!  I'm sure Alex'll be very busy at work that night, but maybe I'll be able to bring him some Macaroni Grill takeout or something at least...    So yeah.  Good times.  Gotta clean the apartment a bit for tomorrow's family visit...  morelater... but if not before Wednesday, "Happy New Year!"

      So yeah.  Made the move.  Like I said, I'll be publishing to both for a little bit, but eventually (and soon) I'll only publish to  urlLink aliwolly.homeip.net/blog.html .  Watched the "Wasting Time" videos  urlLink Eric  made way back when.  I always get so nostalgic when I watch them.  I can't believe how grown up we all are.  Wilson is soon finishing college.  Eric's getting married this summer.  And I'm...  (sigh) a young adult.  I just can't bite the bullet and call myself an adult yet.  I wonder when that happens... that you're able to do that.  I'm thinking that you never realize that you're grown up until one day it hits you.  And that's gotta be hella depressing.  Beh.  Quiet weekend.  Yesterday I made dinner for Alex and me (stir-fry chicken and veggies with rice) and then I went with Alex and Dodi and Scott (her friend from Friday's, he lives down the street from my parents' house in his parents' old house and his parents' are friends with mine) to McGeary's to see HOTD.  I had an awesome time.  It was so great seeing HOTD again, I felt like it's been a while.  There was this group of girls there celebrating one of the girl's 22nd birthday, and among the group were two asian girls who looked like twins.  Well, this old (ok, middle-aged, but compared to the girls he was old) guy showed up, and he was all close with the one asian girl.  Like, wispering things to each other and hugging and dancing.  I was pretty grossed out.  I mean they were just so opposite.  He was approaching old, she was just leaving young.  He was big and tall, she was petite and tiny.  I think one of the girls in the group noticed me making a face or something, and she said to Dodi that the guy was the girl's father.  See, I don't think so.  I mean, he could have been, but I sort of got the impression that the two asian girls were twins, or at least sisters.  But the other girl didn't go near the guy at all, or really even talk to him.  So ew.  Also, it'd be kind of really weird to have your dad come to a bar with you and your friends.  I guess if he was divorced or something... I dunno.  Anyway.  It was a good night.  :)  Today we slept in late and then went out for lunch and picked up a new battery for Alex's car.  He was stuck here all day Thursday because when he went to leave the battery was dead.  When I got home from work I found him vacuuming the floors, dishes done, and no food left in the house.  Not that there was much to begin with.  I felt so bad!  All I had here for him to eat was half a bag of "treasure crisps", two non-frosted strawberry poptarts, and some crackers.  I'm glad I didn't go to the gym after work or anything and I came right home!  We'd tried to jump his car that night but it just wasn't happening, so he had to borrow his dad's car Friday to get around in.  But we got a new battery today and he installed it no problem and the car's working fine.  So rock :)  The unfortunate thing about his having to get a new battery is that it took the rest of his $ (after last night) and so he had no $ to go out tonight (we were going to go to either his CPHM Ambulance banquet or up to 'Toga).  I'm tight on the cash as well, and we did go out last night, and he has to work a 24 hour shift anyways tomorrow, so it's no big deal. So Alex is home tonight and I'm here.  I tried to call Dodi, but she's unavailable, so I'm spending the night in updating the site and then playing the sims.  I have about a million chores I could do tonight (last night's dishes... change the sheets... swiffer the floors... clean the bathroom... take down the tree...) but I refuse to do chores on a Saturday night and instead I'm planning on taking the entire day tomorrow to get shit like that done.     So yeah.  Sims are calling...  morelater...

         RASH DESICION::   I've decided to move the blog!  Please update your favorites/bookmarks/links (if you've graced me with a spot there) to:   urlLink http://aliwolly.homeip.net/blog.html  .  I'll be publishing to both spots for a little while, but eventually just posting to  urlLink aliwolly.homeip.net/blog.html .  I used to publish to my own server but my old computer was crapping out so I'd stopped.  But now that I've got the new one (for almost a year now) I'm going to go back to my own server.  I may actually turn my old one into a little dedicated server on its own.  Also, I was feeling bad about violating the TOS with blogspot and covering up the ad... So yeah.   New blog address:  urlLink aliwolly.homeip.net/blog.html .   Thanks for reading!

      I fixed the skin so it looks good on both IE and Mozilla Firebird.  So rock.  My only regret is that I'm not useing the butterfly image at the top as a background image, but instead using it just as an image at the top because I'm hosting this on  urlLink blogspot  and If I use it as a background image the ad at the top covers up part of it and it looks shitty so instead I'm covering the ad with it.  I feel bad that I'm violating the TOS, so be warned that I may host this blog off of my own server in the near future, which would mean a url change to  urlLink http://aliwolly.homeip.net/blog.html  or something like that.    Yeah.  So now I'm working on the photo album.  I think i'm keeping the main page,  urlLink aliwolly.homeip.net  and the photo album index,  urlLink aliwolly.homeip.net/photo.html  hot pink, because I just love how striking that color is.  I think I'm going to add some albums that should have been up long ago and update other albums, so feel free to  urlLink take a look .    Morelater.  Ali.

      So I'm constantly trying to find new cool (free) things to do with my phone so that I don't get bored with it and buy a new one.  I mean, I  desperately  want a new phone.  Mine doesn't even have a camera built in!  ;)    Dodi cured my need recently by giving me the old camera attachement to one of her old phones ( she  has one of those really cool camera-built-in phones...).  So now I can take pictures with the mini-camera and upload them to my phone and have people's pictures displayed when they're calling.  But only on the  inside .  So I have to open up my phone to see the picture, and I have my phone set to answer when flipped open, so the picture's only there for a second.  So then I'm back to lusting after one of those new camera phones because their external LCDs are color and can display people's pictures on the outside.  Sigh...  So I was playing online this weekend looking around for something new to add to my phone or some new way to use my phone so I wouldn't have such lackluster feelings about it for a while when I stumbled across  urlLink pcsphonetones.com .  This site has a lot of potential.  It's a site that offers free ringers and backgrounds for SprintPCS Vision phones.  ROCK!  I downloaded the Indiana Jones theme song and "Everybody Hurts" by REM.  The coolest thing I found on that site was this: Zelda (original Nintendo) backgrounds and ringers.  Awesome!!  So now my phone's background is the start screen to the original Zelda game (one of my all-time favorite games,  ever ) and when I get a voicemail it plays the beginning of the theme song and when I get a text message it plays the tune that played when you got another piece of the triforce.  I know, I'm a dork.  But I think that rules!!!  Anyway, I say the site has potential because there's not much there yet.  But I'm hoping that they'll add a lot of cool stuff, so I plan on checking back often.  In fact, I think it might make it over into my links drop down ->  The other excellent thing that I found online this weekend to keep me from hating my phone is  urlLink xingtones .  This little app lets you convert any wav, midi, or mp3 into a polyphonic phone tone for your Sprint PCS Vision phone.  It was really easy to use, and it's free as long as you give them 3 email referrals.  And this is one program that I wouldn't mind getting a referral for.  It's awesome!  Or, it has the potential to be.  It does exactly what I wanted it to do: converts your music file and then downloads it to your phone.  The song clip can be a maximum of 30 seconds and the program has a very easy way to clip your songs.  You have complete control over the length and position of the clip in the song.  It is annoying that there isn't a running time when you play the song so that you can pinpoint exactly when you're trimming your clip.  But they say they're constantly improving their product on the webpage, so perhaps in the future...  The other dissappointing thing about it is the quality of the ringtones is not that great.  I originally tried it with an mp3 - "Old Black Rum" by HOTD - and the quality was pretty shitty.  But I was at the parents house and had nothing else to use (got that mp3 from the HOTD website) so when I got home I tried using a wav (because I figured that starting with a compressed mp3 and compressing it further was just no good).  I ripped a wav of "All of the Hard Days Are Gone" off of my  Let it Flow  cd because I was intent on having a HOTD ringer.  I had better results using the wav, but the quality was still crappy (see, we moved from shitty to crappy).  So I figured that part of the problem was all the harmony and instruments, so I ripped a wav of "The Parting Glass" off of the  At the Parting Glass  cd and had  much  better results.  Apparently accapella songs work best.  The quality is still not that great, but it'll do.  So then I did the same with "The Barley Mow" and now I have 2 decent HOTD ringers for my phone.  Rock!  I'm very excited about this app, and I hope they do improve the quality, because it'd be almost perfect but for the quality...  :)  So yeah.  Exciting phone weekend.  I got a bunch of new ringers and backgrounds and a cool new app so that I can make as many new free ringers as my little heart desires.  I also got a new, great deal with Sprint.  I wanted to add the nights and weekends starting at 7 option, but I couldn't do it online for some reason, and I wanted to decrease the minutes on my plan to make it cheaper, but my plan had vision services included and I didn't want to lose that and have to pay an extra $10 a month for it or whatever they make you pay now.  So I went to the Sprint store Saturday with Dodi and they couldn't help me there, but they gave me the number to customer service and I called there and spoke with Greg.  Greg was very nice (and maybe he only seemed so because of the southern accent) and very helpful and gave me everything I wanted.  Rock!  So my new plan is $30/month for 300 anytime minutes and an extra $5/month for nights and weekends starting at 7 and my vision is included  and  he didn't extend my agreement with them for another 2 years like they are supposed to make you do if you want the nights and weekends at 7 thing.  Awesome!    So i'm happy with Sprint again (for now) and I'm happy with my phone again (hopefully for a while).

      I am just so sad to be back at work...  I had a four day weekend because of the holiday on New Year's Day and then I took Friday off of work, so it was just so nice to do basically nothing for four days.  Getting up this morning after sleeping in for four days straight was annoying.  But not hell, because I tried this thing that my dad always said worked: when I was going to sleep last night, I kept telling myself that I was going to wake up in seven hours and that I'd be up by 6:35.  And it worked!  I totally never believed him when he said that he didn't need an alarm clock because he just told his body when he wanted to get up.  I'm so psyched that it worked.  I'm going to do that every night, because getting up at 6:35 makes the morning less hellish.  I was totally (pretty much) on time to work today and I even had to start my car ahead of time and de-snow it.  Awesome!    So yeah.  The extended weekend was good.  New Year's Eve was fun.  Beck, Kevin, Dodi, Tristan, Kevin's sister, Bergeron, and I went to the Macaroni Grill for dinner.  Beck met me at my house beforehand and we had a couple of Vodkatini's (which turned out pretty good, considering I made them).  Then Kevin picked us up and we met everyone at the Macaroni Grill where I had two Cosmopolitans.  So I was pretty drunk by the time we were leaving to go to the Big House.  I had another Cosmo at the Big House, but the one there sucked, it had sours mix or something in it.  So the combination of the large amount of dinner and the bad drink that I had made me feel kind of sick.  I hope I didn't bring the group down, but I was pretty "reserved" for the rest of the night.  Kevin and Beck brought me home soon after the ball dropped, and I passed out pretty much immediately.    New Year's Day was quiet.  Alex had worked a very busy 24 hour shift on New Year's Eve, so he wasn't around, and Beck was spending a quiet day at home and Dodi wasn't available for most of the day.  So I hung out at the parents' house for a good part of the day, and then hung out with Dodi that night.  We watched  Cruel Intentions  and ate buttery microwave popcorn and mini hot dogs wrapped in cresent rolls.  It was a fabulous impromptu girl's night.  :)    Friday I got up kind of late and cleaned up my room (which desperatly needed to be done).  Then I went to the gym and brought shower stuff along so I could shower there afterwards and get right to my day.  I've never showered at this gym before, and I found the shower facilities to be... adequate.  They weren't as nice as those at the YMCA in Clifton Park, but they were better than most of the hostel showers in Europe...  After the gym I went to the bank to deposit Christmas checks and then went shopping around for a liquor cabinet or other piece of furniture that I could repurpose as one.  I was not lucky in my search.  Ah well.  Alex came over later that night and we went to dinner at Delmonico's.  He had the Delmonico's Delmonico steak and I got some special that was steak tips in portobella sauce over garlic mashed potatoes.  He let me have a bite of his steak and I instantly regretted not getting the steak.  It was  divine .  My dinner was very good, but compared to the steak...  ah well.  Now I sound like my mom ;)  Anyway, we came back to the apartment afterwards and watched  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom  which is my favorite Indiana Jones movie.  I was so into the movie and excited about watching it... and then I suddenly passed out.  Ah well.  But yeah, it was an excellent night.  :)  Saturday morning I got up and left Alex sleeping while I went to the mall and met Dodi and Beck to see  Mona Lisa Smile .  First we went to Ruby Tuesday's for lunch, where we got awful service (again).  It's like they hire idiots there.  The movie was pretty good.  Actually, it was really good, up until the end when they just decided to wrap the movie up really quick and it was kind of disappointing.  Whatever.  The theater was  packed , in fact, we couldn't get three seats together, so Dodi and I sat in the row above Beck.  That was kind of annoying... Afterwards we walked around the mall for a bit, and Beck met up with Kevin.   Dodi and I went back to her place where we ate Taco Bell (ghetto fabulous) and watched  American Beauty .  I'd never bothered to watch that movie before.  I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was as enormously amazing as everyone would have you believe.  Dodi curled my hair while we watched the last hour of  The Ring  on HBO, and I was terrified... that I'd jump and knock my head into the curling iron and get burnt.  We picked up her cousin, Jill, and then went to the Big House for drinks and dancing.  I almost bailed on them, we didn't get to my apartment so I could change until almost 11 and I was tired, but they convinced me to go out with them and I'm glad I did.  :)  The drinks were strong Saturday night at the Big House... the bartenders were very free with their pouring of the Bombay Sapphire.  But every time I drink Sapphire, my drunkness doesn't hit me right away, so I end up drinking a lot thinking it's not affecting me, and then suddenly I'm drunk.  So thankfully I was pretty buzzed by the time we went to the third floor to go dancing, because usually I get a little self-concious about dancing, but I wasn't bothered by anything and had a great time.  Dodi and Jill dropped me off at home around 2am, and being alone and drunk and a little hungry, I proceeded to pig out on junk food.  I had potato chips, and then since I had something salty, I needed something sweet, so I broke out a bag of almond M&M's that Alex had bought the weekend before for our trip, but we never opened.  I never buy almond M&M's so I wasn't immediately aware that the packaging is very boring and looks sort of like the new black and white packaging they have for the contest where if you find a bag of colored m&m's inside a black and white bag you win a convertible beetle and $20k and a trip.  So yeah.  So I opened the bag of almond M&M's thinking that they were in the new b&w packaging and when I saw colored M&M's on the inside, I was like, "woah...  I WON!!!"  And then I realized that there were all different colored M&M's inside the bag, and the winning bags have all just one color... and then I realized that I wasn't dreaming, and I never win contests, so I closely examined the exterior of the bag and came to the conclusion that I wasn't a winner and that the packaging for almond M&M's is boring.  I mean, who associates the color, taupe, with almonds, anyway?  So yeah.  Sunday was another quiet day.  I went to the parents house for the afternoon and hung out with the family.  I met Beck at Starbuck's that evening before she returned to Poughkeepsie.  I went home and watched the season premiere of  Sex and the City  (I'm so sad there are only 7 episodes left!!) and then I played Sims and went to bed at a reasonable hour (10:30).  And now I'm back at work and that blows.

      so...     Tuesday  evening I went straight to  urlLink WW  from work.  I signed up and got in line for the middle scale.  I don't know why, but I always went to the middle scale when I was weighing in last time I was losing weight.  So yeah.  The scale was less than what my scale at home would have said.  I think I remember from last time that my scale at home was always consistently 3 lbs higher.  So yeah.  I've got about 24 lbs that I want to lose.  I can do it, I'm sure.  I mean, I lost 60 lbs last time.  I'm oddly nervous about it though.  Like, for some reason I'm worried that I'll do everything right and that for some reason it won't work.  I'm crazy.  Anyway, so Carrie's meeting was awesome :)  She's so high energy, and she has good control over the group without it feeling like a lecture.  And her members really seem to love her.  So that rocks.  Next week I start helping out before the 7:00 meeting as a greeter.  I'm excited that Carrie was able to help me out and get me this "job" because otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford to go to the meetings.  :)    After the meeting (I stayed for the "getting started" session because the plan has changed since I did it last...  I love the changes) I ran home and made a very quick PB&J (3 points) and stuffed it in my mouth as I ran out the door to get in Meredith's car to go to the  urlLink LAOH  meeting.  It was a good time, though I'm not allowed to reveal any of the goings on ;)  Afterwards Meredith and I went to The Fountain (a pub right near my house) so that I could get some dinner: Guinness (3) and French Onion Soup (6).  And I even stayed within my points that day!     Wednesday  I went to the gym after work and busted my ass on the treadmill and elliptical machine.  I went home and talked to Dodi on the phone for a bit, and then talked to Alex who was able to get OT at work, but therefore was unable to come over.  :(  Ah well.  I was stinky/sweaty from the gym anyway and not in the mood to take a shower and I also had plenty of chores to do.  So I got to the chores: I un-decorated the tree and then disassembled it.  I had to throw out the tree skirt (2nd one this season!!!) because Molly and Dude had decided that it was an indoor litter box and, well, ew. I mopped the floor underneath and trashed the skirt.  I brought the tub on wheels from the porch that I bought at Wal-Mart and had to clean off that as well, because for some reason Molly peed on it.  EW!!  My cats are disgusting.  So after cleaning off the frozen pee (and wanting to vomit) I filled the tub with my Christmas.  I de-Christmased the entire apartment and was able to fit it all in the tub on wheels.  I even stuck my Christmas wrapping paper stuff in there as well, so all of Christmas is in one place.  Rock!  After de-Christmasing the apartment, I cleaned out the kitty litter box that has a handle on top of it and I placed it right outside of my kitchen door.  I now put it inside th eapartment when I leave, and when I'm home I stick it out on the porch (and I bring it in overnight).  So now I don't have to worry about having a potentially smelly box inside the house or having the cats just go somewhere because they have no access.  After I was done with that, I was exhausted and went to bed...     Thursday  I went directly home after work! Yay!  First time this week!  I did my dishes and devoured a Nutri-Grain bar (3).  I was planning on cooking dinner: WW Chinese Orange Chicken (5), white rice (4), and string beans (0).  I didn't.  Alex came over directly from work and we were going to go see  Big Fish  but we decided not too (too cold outside, too late at night), so we stayed in an ordered Chinese food instead (had a coupon... and it was too late to start cooking).  We ate our Chinese food and drank red wine and both passed out on the sofa before 11.  We're such gomers ;)    So yeah.  The week's been good.  Busy, but good.  I've been able to stay within my points, and I've been making it to the gym.  We'll see how this goes...  I'm so glad it's Friday and I don't have to be at work for 2 days.  That rules.  Work is oddly quiet today.  Not the phones, but the people.  We're all just sitting here, quietly doing our work (or posting to our blogs... damn!).  It sounds like a Saturday.  I hope the afternoon goes quick...  I can't wait to get out of here!

      I don't think I'll ever know how many licks it takes to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop.  I always lose count.  And then just bite the fucker.    So Saturday night I was up until about 4am playing with the site and organizing pictures on my hard drive.  I guess that's what boredom will do to you :)  Sunday was quiet... went home and did laundry... met dodi for dinner & then watched SATC at her apt...  came home and went to bed.  (note: did none of the chores other than the laundry that I'd planned on doing).  Today: went to work.  Uneventful day.  Carrie thinks she'll be able to get me a job as a greeter at her 5:30  urlLink weight watcher  meetings, so that would give me a very nice discount and be absolutely fabulous.  I'd not joined yet, even though I'm dying to lose some weight again and need some help, because I'm so asspoor.  Ugh.  But at least Carrie helped me figure out fitting WW into my "budget."  Now I just have to stress about paying my monthly  urlLink gym  dues of $32.  How ghetto is that, that I'm worried about spending an extra $32/month?  Sigh.    So no huge updates.  I meant to, but then I went to the gym and came home and watched  Teen Witch  on HBO (what a cheesey movie) and now I'm just  done .  I'm totally ready to pass out.  I think I'm going to make myself do the dishes at least.  I'm totally embarrassed that my tree is still up and that the cat litter is still dirty, but I guess I have to own it and just do a little at a time.  I was thinking that I'd get shit done tomorrow night and that I'd be all good and cook dinner, but after the WW meeting I've got the LAOH meeting at 7:30, and I've got no idea when I'll be getting home.  Hopefully not too late!  (Probably not, because the ladies at that meeting are all old...  that was kind of mean, but kind of true.)  So yeah.  Starting WW tomorrow (well, actually started it today, but going to meetings starting tomorrow).  Found a site on women and weight lifting that is very interesting.  The woman who writes it is pretty funny too.  This is what she writes about the dietary supplement, Fat Trapper: "Sure, it traps the fat, and where do you think all that clumped fat goes if you don't digest it? Buy yourself some adult diapers with every bottle of Fat Trapper, and stock up on fat-soluble vitamins to replace what gets leached out of your body. Unless you think anal leakage is sexy, don't bother. Same with Olestra. Remember, we digest our food for a reason! Throw Fat Trapper and Olestra into the toilet (for a realistic effect, shoot it out of a shotgun from across the room to simulate the explosive colonic action you'd experience from eating it), and eliminate the middle man."  I was pretty hysterical after I read that.  A lot of her other articles are just as entertaining, and I think  urlLink her site is definitely worth a look .    Well, now that I feel like I've written a completely unintelligent, wandering post... It's time to do the dishes.  :(

       Orange Chicken With a Side of Burnt Plastic   I got home from the gym and I was exhausted.  It was about 6:45 Wednesday night and I was ready for bed.  But I had to eat something and since I was home alone, I was planning on making a quick burrito: low fat tortilla with fat free refried beans and fat free chedder cheese wrapped inside and microwaved for about a minute.    I'd just plopped my gym bag down in the middle of the floor and threw my coat over a chair and was rummaging through my "junk" drawer (they're  all  junk drawers with my organizational skills...) when I heard keys jingling outside of the front door to my apartment.  I stopped and looked around to see Alex walking in the door.  "Crap," I thought, "I'm all freaking smelly from the gym... and this place is a dump!"  But I said, "Hey!" and walked over to give him a hug.    "I smell," I said.  "I know," he said.  I punched him in the arm and he hugged me again.    "Have you eaten yet?"  "No, I just got home from the gym... Do you want me to make something?"  He looked shocked and horrified at the possibility.  I went on:   "I've got chicken in the fridge that I took out of the freezer last Thursday to make, but I haven't used it yet and I better use it before it goes bad..." and I set about moving things around in the fridge trying to get to the chicken which had settled in the back on the bottom shelf.  I took out the chicken and set it on the counter and looked at it for a minute trying to assess if it was bad.  Alex picked up the package and squinted at the date: "November 20th," he read and looked at me like I was trying to poison him.  "I bought it then and it's been frozen since then... I just took it out of the freezer the other day," I explained.  He didn't look convinced, but he put the package down.    I sliced through the plastic and sniffed at the chicken.  It didn't smell bad, so I figured it must be good.  I put the now opened package back down on the counter and turned to look at the recipe I'd pulled up on my computer screen when Alex rushed by me and snatched the chicken up from the counter and stuck it on the stove.  "salmonella!  You shouldn't put meat on the counter!"  He flew into the bathroom to grab the Clorox Wipes and began wiping down the counter and when he was finished he scrubbed his hands.  Meanwhile I oiled the pan and seasoned the chicken.    I think watching me cook was a stressful event for Alex.  I kept dripping chicken juice and dropping things.  He'd follow behind me and clean the "salmonella" off of whatever I'd dripped on.  I have to admit, that I was very disorganized in my cooking attempt.  I started the rice a little late and then forgot when I'd started it so I had no idea when to take it out (had to wing it... turned out fine).  Then I misread the label on the can of mandarin oranges and accidentally opened two cans to make the orange chicken sauce and had to scoop half of the oranges into a container mid-sauce-making.  I turned the chicken too late and ended up burning parts of it.  And the string beans which I'd planned on making with the chicken had gone bad (though I didn't realize it right away and Alex, horrified, pointed out that there was  mold  on some of the beans).    Dinner was almost done when Alex came over to inspect... and picked up one of my new knives that I got for Christmas that I'd left on the stove apparently too close to one of the burners.  "I knew I smelled something burning other than chicken!" he said as he held up the knife by the blade to show me that the black plastic handle had begun to melt.  "Oh no!! That was one of my new knives!" I screetched.  Alex quickly grabbed another knife and pushed the melting plastic pretty much back into shape: "See, good as new."  He hugged me and told me I was cute when I was upset.  Which made me feel better...    ...until I walked into the living room with our plates of food and saw that there was smoke filling my apartment.  "It's kind of hazy in here," Alex said as he opened one of the windows and stuck the fan in it.  "Yeah..." I said as I sank down onto the sofa.  "Why can't I do this!  Why do I suck at cooking!" I whined.  "Aw, you don't suck!" he said.  And he put on a good show of eating the chicken.  And I guess it wasn't actually too bad...  if you could get past the smell of burnt plastic that lingered in the air.    So it was yet again another adventure in cooking for me.  They say that practice makes perfect, but I'm afraid that one of these times I'm going to burn the place down...

       More fun with my sprint camera...  So I left my Fruit2O in the car last night and it was frozen today and I've been drinking it as it melts and I just noticed that the ice inside the bottle looks very, um... phallic.  I don't know if you can tell, but here's a picture:     I wish it would break... It's kind of embarrassing every time I drink it...  ;)

      oh, and i figured out what the ghetto writing on my car says.  it says "sars 2012".  perhaps it's an evil fortune cookie of death and it's predicting that I will die of sars in the year 2012.  god, i hope not.  i'd only be 33...    yeah.  i totally forgot to wash my car after the gym tonight, so that's still on my car.  damn.  i hope it rains soon.

      so i've been watching oxygen tonight.  i got sucked in by this episode of "the knot: real weddings" (or something like that) with this sort of psycho bride.  she was very cheerleader.  like, i really believe she was a cheerleader in high school/college.  she was very controlling at her rehearsal...  she had this voiceover going where she was saying something like, "i really want to relax and not worry about everything because in a few weeks people won't remember the dinner, all they'll remember is if they had a good time or not."  but while the voiceover was going she was on screen screaming at people to get in line and rolling her eyes at her family members and just being pretty much a psycho.  then on the big day she drove herself to her wedding (which was sort of depressing to me) and she was in the car alone with the camera guy and she was drinking a glass of wine as she was driving.  and they showed her drinking at home before she left.  and it was pretty apparent that she was buzzed trying to drive this car.  i was shocked.  yeah.  but it was a beautiful wedding...  ;)    yeah.  and now i'm watching the ellen degeneres show.  she's freaking hysterical.  :)  I need to go to bed though...  sleepy...

      So it was Dan's birthday yesterday and Meredith and I went out on lunch with $ that we collected from our coworkers to get him a cake.  Then I saw these hot pink cupcakes and decided that we must get them.  So we got some blue ones too (because he's a boy).  But I just had to share my joy that is the hot pink cupcake:      (today is fun with my camera for my phone day, can you tell?)

      I walked out to my car after lunch and was greeted with this:      I had ghetto writing on my car.  It totally must've happened last night while it was parked on the street outside of my apartment... and I live in a nice neighborhood!  GhettoBeetle.  I'm so kind of embarrassed that I drove to work like that!  Like I was advertising whatever the ghetto writing says...  I totally have to wash the car after the gym tonight.  It's a good thing my sister paid me back partially in quarters... now I won't have to get change before I wash the car!  :)   I'm so kind of skeeved that someone touched my car though...

      Friday night I got home from the gym to find Alex waiting for me.  I showered and he made me pick where to go for dinner.  When I couldn't come up with anything, he suggested that we go to El Loco Mexican Cafe on Madison Ave.  I had, like, a billion points left for the day and was totally in the mood for Mexican food so that's where we went.    We got to El Loco Mexican and it was  packed .  The cafe is very small, with four-seater booths along one wall, two seater rectangular tables in the middle that can be pushed together for larger parties, and two seater small circular tables along the other wall.  There's a bar in the back right corner that is just basically an opening in the wall to the kitchen area with no seats in front of it.  The hostess suggested that we stand by the bar and said that it should only be a few minutes. We stood at the bar and ordered our drinks (I had a sangria - which was very good - and Alex had a Corona).  Then two women walked in and also stood by the bar, and we were annoyed to see them seated before us.  The hostess bitchily explained that the two women had another person in their party that was parking the car and they were seated at a table to handle three and we needed to wait for a two seater table.  What was annoying was there were at least two 2 seater tables that were already open but not cleaned and at least 3 other four seaters.  Annoying.  Whatever.  We got seated a few minutes later and ordered chips with two types of salsa for dipping.  The salsa there was  awesome !  We tried to figure out what to order but the menu was so big and there was a couple behind Alex that was very distracting, so it took us a bit...  The couple behind Alex was apparently going through a divorce.  Alex gave me the play-by-play as they fought.  And then he didn't have to because they got  loud .  How embarrassing!  They finally left... they got very quiet before they left and then they hurried out of there.  I wonder who paid for dinner?  Anyway.  By the time they left we'd been served our dinners.  I got a spinach burrito and Alex got the burrito grande.  The food was fabulous!  I'd definitely go back (even though the service was a little sucky).    After dinner we went to Crossgates to see  Big Fish .  The theater was packed and we ended up sitting in the very front section on the floor where the seats tilt back so that you can see the screen.  The leaning of the seats made it easy to lean on Alex at the same time, so I was able to watch the movie pretty comfortably.  The move was great.  I really enjoyed it and so did Alex.  The ending was kind of sad and I totally cried.  But yeah, the movie was very enjoyable and I'm glad we went to see it.    Saturday night I went to HOTD at Revolution Hall with Beck and Dodi.  I'm ass,  ass  poor, so the girls had to convince me to come out with them and that it was ok that they paid for me because that's what friends do.  As of Friday I was down to $100 until I get paid again (2 weeks), because I had to renew my gym membership and I was charged fees that I wasn't expecting.  So blow.  But yeah, the girls wanted me to come out with them and so I went (even though I felt like a ghetto-poor tool).  I remembered that my sister owed me $13, so after I talked to her and she told me she'd give me the $13 on Sunday, I let myself go to the bank and get out $20.  So after Beck paid my way in, I used my $20 to buy us the first round of Guinness.  We got the last table on the lower level which was  right  up front and center.  It so rocked that we got a table, and we could totally pull off sitting right front and center because we're all so familiar with the band.  We had an  awesome  time.  Kevin and his friends showed up after a little bit and they seemed to enjoy the band as well.  Dodi was totally flirting with the big guy in HOTD (he told her she was beautiful at the last show) so I told her to ask him to sing "The Parting Glass" at the end and he totally did (which  rocked  because I  love  that song and I haven't heard him sing it in  forever  because lately he doesn't sing it unless they're at the Parting Glass.  So yeah.  I had an awesome time (but I totally missed Alex because HOTD always reminds me of him and he couldn't come out because he had to be at work at 7 the next morning for a 24 hr shift).  After HOTD I went home and Beck and Dodi headed up to CP.  Beck, unfortunately, got harrassed all night.  The rebound guy from last year kept drunk dialing her.  She didn't want to talk to him, he should have just gotten the picture and stopped calling.  How embarassing for him.    Today was quiet.  I woke up at 8 when Alex came walking into my bedroom and scared the crap out of me :)  He needed to drop by and grab his work shirt, which he left here Thursday night.  He gave me a quick hug and a kiss and went back to work.  I layed there and could only think, "God, how bad must I look?!"  I checked myself out in the mirror in the bathroom and determined that I didn't look  too  bad.  Then I read for about an hour but then decided that sleep ruled and went back to sleep until 11.  I got up and pretty much sat around the house until about 3 when I finally got my act together and went grocery shopping.  So now I have food (hopefully enough for 2 weeks) and about $50 left.  Sigh.  I'm sure I'll survive though ;)  My sister came by for a little bit and dropped of the $13 but she soon left to go hang out with one of her friends.  That was ok, because Beck had called and was about to head back to Poughkeepsie and wanted to meet for coffee.  So we met at the Starbuck's in Stuyvesant Plaza.  I had a tall black coffee, and I think my buzz is just wearing off now...  :)  I came home to watch SATC and I've been watching TV all night.  I rule.  It was a nice, relaxing day.  I'd totally forgotten until a few minutes ago that our new "flex hours" start at work tomorrow, and I don't have to be there until 8:30, so that rocks!!  So it's ok that it's 11 and I'm still up, because I don't have to get up until like 7/715 and I'll totally get 8 hours of sleep if I go to sleep now.  Rock!    So yeah.  Boring post, sorry.  I'll try and come up with some interesting stuff this week instead of just recaps of my days...

      So part of my job is to review medical bills as they come in for a claim with an injury in it to make sure that the treatment the injured person is getting is related to the accident and that it's reasonable.  The medical portion of auto insurance is where the most fraud is, so reviewing the medical claims is a large part of my job and it's the part of my job that I find particularly interesting and enjoyable.  I really enjoy reading the notes for a hospital or doctor visit and decoding the medical jargon.    Last week I came across a term that I'd never heard before.  I was reading notes for a claim in which the injured person was claiming injury to her right wrist.  She's, of course, from Gloversville and the doctor that she was treating with was also from Gloversville.  I get the "best" notes out of Gloversville.  The grammar alone in the notes is enough to make a person want to run away screaming from any doctor or hospital out in that area.  This particular note was detailing the pain the injured person was experiencing in her right arm and it said that she was "complaining of pain and tenderness along the radial styloid and anatomical snuffbox."  This line stopped my in my tracks.  "Anatomical snuffbox?"  I wondered...  "What's that?!"  I mean, that sounds nasty...    So I went over to my supervisor's bookshelf and pulled  The Anatomy Coloring Book  off the shelf to consult.  (I love that book, by the way... I totally want one for myself so I can color the whole thing in!)  I flipped through until I found the page dealing with the wrist/hand area.  I found the radial styloid right away - that's the part at the base of the thumb.  But I didn't see any listing for "anatomical snuffbox".  So I asked Mary Ellen.  She immediately thought the worst and we were both giggling as she dialed up a friend who's a nurse to see if she knew what it was.  She prefaced her question with, "Now, get your mind out of the gutter..." and after she asked the question I could hear giggling on the other end of the line as well.  Mary Ellen's friend asked around in her office and was informed that the anatomical snuffbox is the fleshy part of your hand between your thumb and your forefinger... kind of like the "crotch" of your hand... Ok, that's nasty too ;)  I guess it's called an anatomical snuffbox because back in "the day" people used to put tobacco (or as Mary Ellen explained it, cocaine) there to snuff it through their nose.    So I guess you learn something new every day... :)

      I can remember playing at being a teacher when I was little, and if anyone would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I'd tell them I wanted to be a teacher, but I think that was because I lacked imagination.  Well, no, I was a pretty imaginative kid, so it wasn't a lack of imagination, it was just the easy way out.  I mean, besides my parents, teachers were the only adults I knew, so I picked the teaching profession because I didn't know what all was out there to choose from.    And I guess I still don't really know all that's out there for a person to do in this world.  I just ended up in the job I'm in now... I knew I needed a full time job and I knew I wanted one that required a degree because I'd earned that, and this one fit the bill.  It was the only job I interviewed for when I first started looking, and when they offered me the job, I accepted it because it was the easiest option.  I've been lazy, and it was starting to show.    At work my desk began to pile up with mail, and my diary count of items I needed to address in individual files soared.  I didn't know what to do about it; I was overwhelmed and didn't know how to dig myself out of my mess.  I didn't care, either.  I don't care about automobile insurance and I couldn't figure out how to make myself care about my job.      Outside of work my laziness was showing as well.  I'd gained a few pounds (even went out and bought jeans in the next size up), I'd done nothing to improve my financial situation, and my apartment became a disgusting black hole of filth.    Then, a couple of weeks ago, two things occurred that helped me change my attitude.  First, Carrie offered me the member helper position at her WW meetings, allowing me to be able to afford to attend meetings again.  I've never been successful at losing weight without attending WW meetings, and once I started back at the meetings I instantly switched modes back to being serious about losing weight.  Then, I had a review with my supervisor in which she pretty much told me, in a very nice way, that I've been a slacker and that I needed to start catching up.  She said she'd help me get through it because she understood how I got there, but if I didn't turn my performance around she wouldn't be so understanding in the future.  She gave me a few ideas on how to handle a workload that seemed completely overwhelming and turn it into something manageable.  Her plan made sense, and something finally clicked in my head that allowed me to see past my total lack of interest I have in insurance to what was important about my job: that I put in an effort that I can be proud of.    Since then I've been busting my ass at work trying to do the very best job I can.  It's been hard owning up to my mistakes, but I know I just have to own it so that I can move past it and do a better job in the future.  I definitely don't plan on being at my current job forever, but while I'm here I want to do work that I can be proud of.  That, at least, makes the job bearable.    My new work ethic, combined with my new vigilance towards my weight loss efforts, have inspired me to improve other areas of my life as well.  I finally got around to mopping the floors and cleaning the bathroom, and I'm trying to stay on top of the dishes and the laundry.  I've been getting up on time so that I have time in the mornings to let my car warm up so I don't speed away, driving it cold.  I've been actually taking out my contacts at night and not sleeping with them in.  And I've been more focused on my efforts to get in shape so that I can meet the  urlLink NYSP Candidate qualifications .  That is a job that I could be proud of every day.    It's a bit late for proclamations about the new year, but I say that 2004 is the year of a new and improved Ali.

       Even my hair wanted to shirk its responsibility this morning.    Soft morning light, filtered through the white mesh canopy above my bed, fell on my eyes and I woke up enveloped in a cloud: my feather bed below me, my down comforter above me, and my boyfriend next to me.  It was perfect... And then I realized it was a Wednesday and I had to be at work in - check the clock - oh God: 45 minutes.   I sat up and immediately understood it was a bad idea when my head took a minute to catch up with me.  I sank back down into bed.  Alex rolled over and caught me in a bear hug.  "Call in..." he mumbled.  "I can't," I whined.  I reached over to the nightstand, picked up my cell phone, and dialed my supervisor's number.  "But I can sleep some more..." I said, as the phone rang and Mary Ellen's voicemail picked up.  "Mary Ellen, it's Ali, I'm going to be about an hour late today... I'll just work through my lunch to make it up, if that's ok."  I flipped the phone closed and rolled back under the covers.    I woke up an hour later and realized that I was still going to be late to work.  I fell out of bed and stood, disoriented, in the middle of my room.  "Ugh... Head..." Alex moaned.  I shuffled out to the kitchen and brought him water and Advil.  "Thanks..." he grunted as he downed the pills and then immediately fell back asleep.  I stood looking at him for a moment, snug in my bed, and then pushed away any lingering thoughts of calling into work.  I finished the water as I walked down the hall into the bathroom.    I did not like the reflection in the mirror.  She looked tired.  And hun-gover.  Perhaps I shouldn't have had so much wine last night.  But I was so excited about my success at Weight Watchers earlier that evening (lost another 2.8 pounds for a total of 10.6 in five weeks!) that when Alex suggested we go to Ruby Tuesday's, I couldn't resist... And the drinks there were two for one, so of course I couldn't refuse a free glass of wine... And then when he asked if I'd like to go to the Ginger Man after dinner I was in no condition to resist.  I didn't  have  to get more wine there, but the Ginger Man has these nifty little wine samplers with three, 3 ounce "tastes" of wine and after I was done with my "Sweet Tooth" collection I was pretty drunk.    I didn't know where to begin to fix the girl in the mirror, but I did know that I didn't have enough time to shower.  Luckily, it was my day off for washing my hair, so I figured I'd just pony tail it and go.  The hair did not want to cooperate.  The hair, in fact, wanted to go back to bed.  No matter what I did to it, it would revert back to its sleeping position: sticking out at all angles.  I'd get the bulk of my hair back into a pony tail, and the hair on the sides would stick straight out.  It was actually incredible.  I almost just gave up.  It was like my hair was telling me to give in and go back to bed.    But I fought it.  I tamed the beast that was my hair and I fought the sluggishness leftover from my wine indulgences and I made it to work.  (Eventually.)  And I had a productive day.  (Mostly.)  And I've learned my lesson and won't get drunk again on a work night.  (Probably.)

       Horoscope Round Up - 2/17/04:  "You'd love nothing better than to stay inside all day, but duty calls. You have to go out and do your part in the world, but you don't have to like it. Coming home to a comfortable chair and a good book is your respite."  How true is that?!  I totally did not want to get out of bed today and even though I got  nine  hours of sleep, it was still a fight getting myself out of bed at 7:30!!  But I don't think it'll be a book and a comfy chair tonight... it'll probably be my broken sofa and Sex and the City or the Style Network... ;)  "You've been coasting in neutral for long. Pick up the pace and keep it moving. Live up to your potential. Your boss and coworkers are rooting for you. Welcome back to your career, which is already in progress."  Guess I better stop blogging.  But that's sort of true.  I'm finally pretty much caught up, but the past few days I've been getting minimal done.  So that's kind of a kick in the pants.  I should start being good again and not let myself get lazy again...    "Romantically you're likely to be in a good space right now, dear Cancer. If you're single, you're in no hurry to change that, and if you're involved, you and your partner should be getting along very well. However, you might experience a little doubt when a current or potential partner becomes rather incommunicative. Your friend, however, probably has money worries up to the eyebrows. Let your partner know you're there to listen, then back off. Enjoy your day."  This horoscope also rings pretty true.  I  am  in a pretty good space right now.  :)  Also, this week Alex is working a lot of nights, so I'm thinking that we won't be able to hang out too much, and I'm sure he'll be trying for some OT as well, because we were both complaining on Sunday that we'd both just got paid and were already poor.    Final horoscope for the day, my chinese horoscope for the year of the goat: "You'll feel rather nervous, emotive, anxious. If you don't take necessary precautions, your affective life could very well be perturbed, especially if you live in a couple. You'll imagine that a rival puts you in the shade or that your preferred one turns his/her eyes elsewhere; doubtlessly your fear will only be imaginary. Beware, you'll have a strong tendency to live above your means! Don't think that you can always get away with it; you may very well find yourself this time in a blind alley."  I think they just took a bunch of words and strung them together.  Or maybe they wrote something that would make sense, but then took out a thesauras and started to randomly replace words.  It's like reading a bunch of fortunes from fortune cookies all strung together.  that's funny.

       just had to gush... ;)   last saturday i was upset.  i was being a big, self-pitying baby.  i'd convinced myself that i had no friends and that no one wanted to hang out with me after my saturday night plans with beck and dodi never happened.  the whole week had been building up to it though.  i'd been depressed that week before because other than tuesday and friday nights when alex and i had hung out, i'd spent every night alone in my apartment.  and, i mean, i like my apartment.  and i like having alone time.  but only when i'm choosing alone time.  i wasn't choosing to hang out with myself all those nights, it was my only option.  so then when the saturday plans fell through the lonliness from the week before came back and spiraled into a bad scene.  in fact, i even called alex crying.  and i don't like to be crying girl.  but that night i was.  and he made it better.    and this week he made sure to try and be with me every night this past week.  last sunday night he had to work, but he was partners with Foster, so they came over to my apartment for dinner.  i made them boboli pizzas: one was a "healthy" one with fat free ricotta cheese and roasted veggies, and one was a traditional pizza with sauce, cheese, pepperoni, peppers and onions.  i'd wanted to make my own dough, but there wasn't enough time.  i made enough of a scene even just using pre-formed crusts...  i managed to cut my thumb and my index finger on my left hand while slicing up veggies for the "healthy" pizza and then just before they walked in the door i took a large chunk out of my left thumb and it bled.  a lot.  i'd been slicing zuchini and suddenly i realized that i wasn't cutting veggies anymore, i was cutting my thumb.  i answered the door with a bloody paper towel wrapped around my thumb.  mmm..  appetzing.  anyway, the pizza came out ok (i have to learn how to take a compliment) and it was awesome to have the company :)  then monday i got home from the gym after work to find alex asleep on the sofa waiting for me.  and tuesday he met me after my WW meeting... Wednesday evening found us hanging out again.  Thursday, i thought for sure that he'd had enough of me, and was pleasently surprised to hear from him during the day... he'd called to let me know that he'd taken an extra shift and wouldn't be around that night but would call me the next day so we could hang out.  Friday we went up to Saratoga to hang out with Foster and his girlfriend, Amy.  And then Saturday was Valentine's day.  We had 9 o'clock reservations at Saso's in Albany for sushi.  When we'd decided on Valentine's plans earlier in the week, Alex said that he'd take me out to wherever I wanted to go for dinner.  So I figured that he could buy dinner and I'd get the drinks and dessert afterwards and that would be our gifts to each other.  I didn't think we'd really be exchanging gifts because we didn't even do that for birthdays last year.  So when Alex showed up at the apartment to go to dinner and said that he got me something I was pleasently surprised.  He held out a dark green and navy blue box and i opened it up to reveal a claddagh necklace.  it's absolutely beautiful.  it's yellow and white gold... yellow chain and ring portion with white hands, heart, and crown.  i love it.  as he helped me put it on he explained that he remembered me saying a few weeks back that while beck and i were in ireland i didn't buy myself a claddagh ring, even though they were abundent, because i thought that you should really be given one by someone special.  so he recruited Foster to help him pick out a claddagh for me at Celtic Treasures in Saratoga.  He said that he picked out the necklace because he liked that one much better than the rings they had.  i think it's amazing.  it's so delicate and elegant and just perfect.  he's so sweet.    sigh.  :)  so the evening was amazing.  We had an excellent dinner and went to the Ginger Man for martinis afterwards and we just had a fabulous time.  really, it was my best valentine's day yet.  :)    so yeah... just had to gush...

       Pre-Weekend Update   Yesterday was Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent and the beginning of the holiest season in the Church year.  Meredith and I discovered that there was a chapel about five minutes from work that had masses offering ashes at noon and 1pm, so we decided to go to the 1 o'clock mass during our lunch.  The chapel was located in a strip mall off of Wolf Road and I was disturbed to see that it had a light up sign outside proclaiming "St. Francis Cathedral".  I wasn't sure what we'd find inside... But we got inside and it looked like a normal church.  I was relieved.  The priest was actually pretty good too.  He cracked me up: he kept his notes for his homoly in his hood and whipped 'em out as he walked up to the podium.  The place was packed, but the receiving of ashes and communion went pretty quickly, and Meredith and I weren't  too  late back to work.    So we were back to work with the ashes on our foreheads and I walked into the kitchen and the branch manager was standing in there as I filled my water bottle.  He said to me, "So... Feeling very spiritual today?"  I couldn't believe he said that.  I didn't know how to respond.  I just stammered out, "well...  um...  yeah.  I went to church..." as I pointed at my forehead.  Then he goes on to ask if I was going to see Mel Gibson's  The Passion of Christ  and said that he wasn't going to because "it looked pretty gory."  This guy is such a doofus.  I mean, if you're the branch manager of an office you should know what is and what isn't appropriate to talk about at work.  What a tool.  Ah well.  I just sort of let him talk and changed the subject at my first opportunity.    Last evening Alex and I tried a new restaurant for take out.  We went to  urlLink Sushi House  on New Scotland Ave near Albany Med.  We'd driven by a few times and wanted to get a menu because we knew that they delivered but every time we stopped by they were closed.  So last night after my post-gym shower we drove down and ordered sushi to go.  An obscene amount of food.  We got an appetizer of shrimp gyoza an order of rainbow rolls and two dinner combos that came with miso soup and salad: the maki combo (tuna, salmon & california rolls) and the sashimi imperial combo (21 pieces of raw fish).  I totally gorged myself on sushi etc and still didn't need to dip into my flex points at all.  Rock!  :)  And the food from Sushi house was awesome!!  The shrimp gyoza were excellent and the california rolls were rolled in sesame seeds which added this whole other sweet dimension to them.  I totally can see how this is probably going to become a weekly dinner choice.  That's really one of the most awesome things about living in a city: you can have pretty much anything delivered for dinner.  Rock.  :)    Tonight I went to a tutorial for the NYSP exam right after work at the troop G headquarters.  When I got there there was about 25 other people packed into a small lobby area.  Most were guys.  Actually, there were three other girls, and that's kind of weird because that's exactly how many I predicted would be there.  Well, most of these guys were younger and they smelled.  The little room smelled so bad.  I was so thankful when we were finally let out of that room to the room upstairs where the class was held.  Steve was the presenter of the class and he did a good job.  The material was pretty dry, but whattya gonna do?  He informed us that the test results would be out by the end of May/beginning of June and that the top group would be called back for physical testing starting around the end of the Summer.  He said that for every 2000 down in the ranking you fell you could expect about another 6 month wait.  The test seems incredibly simple.  We took a 35 minute practice test and I was done in about fifteen minutes and didn't miss any questions.  So I'm not worried about the test.  I am still a bit worried about the physical portion.  I mean, there's an off chance that I could be called back as early as the end of the summer.  Which does give me at least 6 months to get going on the arm strength and the endurance, so actually, I'm not too worried.  I can do this.    Now I'm watching  The Look For Less  on the style network.  I love this show.  I totally want to be on it.  They pick out designer outfits, right off of the runway and then duplicate it as closely as possible in a limited budget (most of the time between $100 and $200).  They just recreated a gorgeous Oscar de la Renta outfit in under $100 (including tax).  Awesome.  It's a bit sad how excited I was over that episode.  Well, it's 10 and I guess I should go to bed.  I've seriously been going to bed pathetically early lately.  Alex has been working a lot of nights lately and so instead of sitting around bored at night after I get home from the gym or weight watchers or whatever, I'll have dinner, pack lunch for the next day, pick out my outfit for work and go to bed really early.  So...  it's off to bed...

      I've been having attention issues at work today.  Dodi sent me a link to a comic on  urlLink comics.com  and then I started browsing through my two favorite comics: Get Fuzzy and Pearls Before Swine.  I totally fell in love with a few of the strips and so I've decided to include them here to share the good humor.  :)      I was crying hysterical silent laughter tears in my cube when I saw this one...  I need that one frame on a T-shirt!    The cat is so cute and so evil...  just like Molly...    See, but if it was Molly it would be pooping and behind the TV...    I love his little pink collar with the heart tag!  Bucky rules.  This is why I love cats.    I laughed so hard when I read this...    This is just too silly...      So I better push aside my attention issues and get back to work...  sigh..

      I needed a quick little distraction because my work day was just so freaking boring.   So I cruised on over to  urlLink Eric's website  and was quite amused by his 2/27 post on inventions.  In fact, I had to stifle my laughter and go to the bathroom after reading the line about his father claiming to have coined the term "whiz" when referring to urination.  Too funny.  :)  I was still bored after I'd read nearly all of his recent posts, so I decided to cruise some of his links and I found  urlLink Sara's page .  I really enjoy her writing style and was delightfully distracted by a "Where I've Been in the US" map and I decided to make my own:        urlLink create your own personalized map of the USA   or  urlLink write about it on the open travel guide   There may be other states in there that I went to when I was too young to remember...     well.  back to work.  sigh.

      Expect an added boost to your physical energy today, dear Cancer. It's an excellent day to clean out closets, storage rooms, and the like. Furthermore, some exercise such as biking or walking will be most enjoyable for you. It may also prove to be well worth your while to sit down and take a look at your goals. Are you where you want to be at this stage of your life, or are there changes that need to be made? Exercise both you brain and body.  So that was my horoscope for the day.  And how weird is it that I was planning on cleaning out my closet tonight?  I'm going to the gym after work and then home to clean out the closet.  I'm hoping to find a few items that will be worth trying to sell on ebay.  I've had some sucess in the past selling clothes on ebay.  After I lost weight, I sold a bunch of my "fat" clothes... Jeans from Lane Bryant were quick sellers.  I can think of a few things right now that I know I'll want to sell... hopefully I'll find some "surprises" too.    It's Wednesday and that's hump day and I can't wait for the weekend.  I wish today was Thursday, at least.

       More good news.   So rock.  Today at work they told us that we were getting bonuses.  Rock!  My bonus is enough to pay for new tires for my car (totally went at lunch to Sam's and ordered them) which I  totally  needed.  The one tire in the front got ruined after we hit a pot hole on the way to Sushi House last Wednesday night and the rim bent.  Dodi took the wheel into her shop to see if the guys could bang out the rim for me (she  rules ) and she couldn't believe that I was driving around on that tire.  It was  trash .  It was pretty much bald anyways - as is the other front tire - so I knew that I was going to have to replace them before my inspection by the end of April.  And since I just replaced one of my rear wheels in November or December... can't remember when... I figured I'd replace the other rear wheel so I'd have all new tires on my car.  So rock that the bonus will cover that.  I can't wait to get the tires replaced and my new rims (Alex bought me two rims that we found cheap off of ebay to make up for bending the rim the other night) on the car.  I'll be so glad to not have scraped up rims anymore... and even more glad to not have the full sized spare on... I walked outside yesterday and looked at my car and almost screamed when I saw it because I forgot that I had the spare on:      My slightly ghetto beetle.   So rock.  The bonus will also cover the body work to fix the scrape on the passenger side.  Which rules.  I totally shot an email to Dodi as soon as I knew to see when I might be able to bring the car in.  I'm so glad that the car will be all nice just in time for spring.  I was dreading having to go through the spring/summer with the scraped up pass side and scraped up rims when I really want my car to look nice.  I love it so very,  very  much.  And I'm going to have so much fun detailing it and driving it around all nice and shiny and perfect!  Yay!!

       2004.  Year of New Me.   Here were my New Year's Resolutions: 1. Lose Weight. 2. Get on top of shit at work and stop being lazy. 3. Do something (other than whine) about tremendous debt. 4. Get serious about shaping up for NYSP. 5. Stop being lazy with chores at apartment.   Here's my progress thus far:  1. I've lost 11.8 lbs in 6 weeks.  I'm loving the  urlLink Weight Watchers  program and am still able to go out and enjoy myself on the weekends.  I'm on the verge of needing new jeans because my "skinny jeans" are getting baggy.  I'm five pounds away from the top of my range for the NYSP and 13 pounds away from my personal goal.  I'm thinking that I may actually re-evaluate my personal goal because I think I could be sucessful at losing more weight than that and maintaining that weight loss.  2. My desk is worlds away from what it was two months ago.  I'm still not completely on top of everything, but who is?  I'm able to address pretty much everything on my diary on a daily basis and my mail gets worked within 3-5 days of receipt, if not sooner.  I'm doing  much  better than I was before.  I still have completely unproductive days every once in a while, but for the most part I'm rocking at work compared to how I was before.    3. I finally did something about my debt.  For the last 4 years or more I've been worried about the incredible debt I was accumulating.  But I did nothing about it.  I continued to spend on my credit cards and my debt kept amassing.  It got to a point where I was paying so much in minimum payments on these cards that I was barely making it paycheck to paycheck.  Finally, I decided enough was enough.  I approached my dad to see if he'd be a co-applicant on a personal loan to consolidate my debt.  I used a loan calculator online to figure out how much a monthly payment would be on this very large loan that I would need with a five year term.  It turned out that the monthly payments were about $100 less than what I paid in minimum payments on my credit cards.  It was rediculous for me to not go for the loan.  Making just the minimum payments, I wouldn't have the credit cards paid off for at least 25 years or so.  But making the slightly smaller monthly payments on a loan would mean that it would all be paid off in five years.  So this past weekend, my dad and I went to our credit union to see about getting a loan.  Unfortunately, I was denied.  For a personal loan, the applicant has to qualify on their own, even if there is a cosigner.  And because of my massive debt, there was no way I could qualify.  The loan officer suggested that I borrow the money from an individual and my dad immediately said that he could loan me the money.  I had no idea that he was in a position to loan me that kind of money, but he apparently was.  And he was willing.  So Sunday I discussed with both parents what the payment plan was and they gave me a check.  So now I have to deposit it and pay off all my credit cards and cancel them.  I can't wait!  I'm going to the bank tomorrow during my lunch and then making the payments as soon as the check clears.  And as I pay each card off, I'm cancelling it.  It's gonna feel so great!  And it's going to be an instant boost to my credit rating.  I obtained a copy of my credit report and it revealed that the only negative thing on there was that I had such an extreme amount of debt.  I had no dings for late payments or anything like that.  So rock!  I'm so excited that I'm going to have my debt paid off in five years!  By then my car will be paid off too!  Yay!!  Thanks Pa and Wham!!    4. I've maintained my goal of getting to the gym at least every Monday and Wednesday for cardio and weight training and I've also been getting to the gym on Thursdays and Saturdays (and Fridays when Alex is working).  So I'm doing very well with my training for the NYSP.  I can consistently do an 11 minute mile, and I need to work my way down to just under a ten minute mile to qualify.  My arm strength is coming along, though I could be working harder at that.  But overall I'm doing very well with this goal.  Also, I'm really enjoying my time at the gym.  :)  5. While my bedroom is still a train wreck of a mess, the rest of the apartment is relatively clean.  I need to get on a regular schedule with the cleaning of the floors, and the litter box totally needs to be cleaned tonight (suck), but the past couple of weeks there hasn't been a huge pile of dishes in the sink and it's not 'cause I'm not cooking.  So I'm getting much better at keeping up with the dishes.  Now I need to get back to weekly cleanings of the floor and the bathroom and I totally need to get off my ass and clean my room.    So, altogether, I'm doing great!  I get inspired by my sucesses and they push me to achieve more.  I'm hoping to be my most perfect self by my birthday this year (25!  Oh God, I'm getting old!) and it looks like I'm on a good track.  :)

       craziness   I left for the gym at 6:30am and it was potentially gorgeous out.  It was cold, but it hadn't preciptated overnight like the forecast said and so as I walked to the car I was happily thinking of how glad I was that it didn't snow as predicted.  As I was in the gym on an elliptical machine next to the windows, I noticed that it had started to flurry.  I thought, "There's the dusting they were predicting."  I finished my workout and took a shower.    When I left the building after my shower I was confronted by a veritable blizzard outside.  Snow was blowing at a 45 degree angle and there was already about an inch of heavy, wet snow accumulated on my car.    By the time I got to work (a 10 minute drive) the snow had stopped.    It's now the end of the day.  The snow from this morning is almost all melted on the lawn outside of my office.    March is freaking crazy.

      Wow.  It's been over a week since I've posted.  I'm such a slacker...  So my rims that we bought offa ebay came in the other day and they're pretty much perfect, which rules because they were really cheap.  Rock!  I brought them to Sam's Club yesterday because my new tires were in and they put them on for me.  My little car is so nearly perfect now!  :)  The new tires are great... I can actually stop now.  ;)  Seriously, my tires were like bald before so there's really a difference.  And my rims all look nice and shiny and mostly not scratched, which is  so  much better than before because the back two rims were just scraped to shit.  So awesome!  I'm bringing Gus in to Dodi's shop next week (I think) to get the scrape on the passenger side fixed.  I'm  so  excited for that to be gone.  Now that the weather's getting warmer and less wet I totally want my car to be washed and shiny all the time, and that scrape really hurts to look at when the rest of the car is all shiny.  Yay!  My car is going to be so cute again!  I love my car, so very much, and that's awesome because I still have 4 years of payments before it's paid off.  But it's so worth it!  :)  I love bringing my car to get the oil changed or something like that because these big manly-men in the shops always are impressed by it.  They're like, "oh, that's a turbo beetle...  Those things move, don't they?" and I'm always like, "yep!"  I'm so proud of Gus!  :)  So...  In other, non-car-related news...    My bridesmaid dress from Carrie's wedding came in.  I went to Jocelyn's in CP Tuesday to try it on.  I brought my shoes that I bought, like, months ago so I could see if I was going to need the skirt hemmed or something like that.  I looked awesome in the dress.  The dress rocks.  The top is ultra flattering and the skirt is wonderfully full and so cute with a little sweep train.  Dodi came along with me and took some pics of me with her camera phone.  The pics are a little small and the dress looks  much  better in person, but you get the idea:               That last pic is of me in the dressing room reluctantly taking off my shoes (yes, I'm wearing a shirt).  My shoes are incredibly cute and go  so  well with the dress.  The whole ensemble is just so classy.  Carrie did a great job!    Oh!  Friday night Alex and I went up to Foster and Amy's new house in Greenwich.  It's  way  out there... Past Saratoga...  It took a while to get out there, but they're house is worth the drive.  It's  gorgeous .  It's 150 years old and the rooms are so cute and there are so many old fashioned details that make the house so charming.  But then the kitchen is beautiful with what look like brand new high gloss granite counters.  Absolutely gorgeous.  They've been doing a lot of work on the house (the last owners were apparently fans of ducks as there's wallpaper all over the place with ducks on it in the rooms they haven't gotten to yet) and the place just looks amazing.  We had a very nice night up there.  Amy gave us the grand tour and then we had pizza and beer and played Monopoly (I totally was kicking ass... But we had to leave before the game was over).  Anyway, it was a great time and their house is amazing - exactly what I would want my house to be like.  I'm really happy for them.  :)  Saturday night I went out with the girls to see  urlLink HOTD  at the  urlLink Parting Glass .  We had a great time!  We got reservations and sat right up front.  I'd never actually gotten reservations there before, so it was a new experience for me.  There were three older women sitting right in front of us... It was kind of strange, like, looking into our futures or something.  Except hopefully we won't weigh that much or dress like old women when we're that old.  ;)  But yeah, it was a great time, and a great warm up for this weekend's festivities!    Speaking of... This weekend looks to be fabulous. Saturday there's the St Paddy's day parade in Albany.  We'll most likely be viewing the parade from the corner in front of Pauly's where we'll be drinking our Guinness.  We'll be heading to WT's most likely after the parade and then... Who knows?  That night we're going to see  urlLink Seven Nations  at  urlLink Revolution Hall .  That's really a great venue and it looks like it'll be a great show.  Seven Nations is awesome and  urlLink The Jimmy Kelly Band  is opening for them and they're pretty good too.  I can't wait!  Sunday we'll be going to Northern Lights for their "Pre-St. Pat's Blow Out Bash" to see the  urlLink The McKrells  and  urlLink The Glengarry Bhoys .   That  show should be excellent as well.  I  love  The Glengarry Bhoys.  Right now I'm listening to their  Juice  album.  They rock.    I think before the show on Sunday I'll be getting take out from my church's corned beef and cabbage dinner.  I  love  corned beef and cabbage.  It's like, seriously, my favorite meal.  I expect to be eating it a lot this week.  I also expect that I will not lose weight this week, but I guess I can just own it and get back to losing weight next week.  ;)  It'll actually be a little disappointing not to lose this week because I've got this weird pattern going where one week I'll lose 1.something and the next I'll lose 2.something and so this week I "should" lose 2.something according to my pattern and that would put me to my 10% goal at  urlLink WW  and that's a sort of big deal.  Also that means I'm like 5 lbs away from my initial goal, but I think I want to lose more weight than that anyway.  Ah well.  I'll get there.  If not sooner, then later.    Well.  After not posting for a week, this was a hella long post.  I feel like I could have written so much more...  And I feel like I could have written it all so much more interestingly.  Ah well.  morelater.

      I came into work this morning and the first email that I read was from Beck.  She asked if I remembered what the difference was between a reel and a jig.  When we were in Dublin in August we'd gone on a musical pub crawl and we were instructed that you could tell between a reel and a jig because one had a rhythm of "rashers and sausages" and the other was "black and decker".  I couldn't remember which one was which either (we'd both imbibed on quite a few pints during that pub crawl...), but I was determined to find the answer to her question.    First, I  urlLink Googled  for the answer, but didn't come up with anything.  So then I turned around and asked the guy in the cube across the way, Matt, if he had any trad CDs with him (he's also a fan of Celtic music).  I was in luck, because he did have a trad CD at his desk that had both a jig and a reel on it.  I popped it in and quickly got my answer.  I'm recording it here, so that next time I "need" to know (because you know I'll forget again) I can just look up in my blog archives around St Patrick's Day '04 and see that:    Jigs are Rashers and Sausages.  Reels are Black and Decker.   It was a low key St Patrick's Day, which was fine, because I did plenty of partying this past weekend.  ;) My Green Potato Soup was a hit here at work.  After work I went up to the parents' house and had corned beef and cabbage and then Dodi and I went to Friday's, where Scott met up with us, for a couple of pints of Guinness.  We were joined by Scott's friend, Frank, and Dodi's cousin, Chris, and we had a good time chatting and imbibing.  We didn't see HOTD because we thought that since we wouldn't get there until after 7 we'd miss most of the show and it wouldn't be worth the $10 cover.  Meredith and her husband went, and it turns out that they played until, like, 10, but it doesn't matter, I think I'm going to see them Friday anyways.  Ugh.  Back to work.

        Happy St. Patrick's Day!!           A few little dancing Irish guys in honor of St. Patrick's Day... So we're having a little "party" in the office today because it's St Patrick's Day and because it's Michael's last day.  I brought in "Irish" Green Potato Soup.  I put Irish in quotes because I'm not exactly sure it's really an Irish recipe, but that's the name of it.  It's potato and leek soup with broccoli and then pureed.  I don't think next time I make it I'll totally puree it.  I think I'll just smooth it out a bit or whatever and leave some chunks because it looks kind of watery to me and I like thicker soup.  Or maybe put in less water or something.  Anyway, I hope it's good! I'm heading up to my parents' house after work today to have corned beef and cabbage with the family.  I  love  corned beef and cabbage.  It's my favorite meal, like, ever.  After that I was planning on going to see  urlLink HOTD  at  urlLink Revolution Hall , but I think that since I'd be kind of late (show starts at 6 and I probably won't get to my parents' house until like 5:45) I think I'll skip it.  I want to go see  urlLink HOTD  at  urlLink McGeary's  this Friday, anyways... and it's cheaper there...  So there ya go.  Dodi and I might go out for a pint tonight either at Friday's or  urlLink The Old Dublin Inn  and that'll be the extent of my St Patrick's Day celebrations (I did enough "real" celebrating this past weekend, I think).   So anyways, Happy St Patrick's Day!

      So the weekend was absolutely fabulous.     Saturday  I got up early and went to the gym.  Alex and Beck met me at my place around noon and we had some Guinness and Jameson before we hit the road to watch the parade.  The walk to the parade route wasn't long at all, but it was  damn  cold.  We stopped off at WT's on the way for a pint to warm up.  The parade was boring as ever, but that's really not why people go out on that Saturday.  We met up with some people at the parade and we all piled into Jesse's car and went to  urlLink McGeary's  afterwards.  McGeary's was packed, so we went to the Big House for dinner and then everyone pretty much went home and crashed for a bit.  Alex and I met up with Steve and Foster and Amy at  urlLink Revolution Hall  in troy for the  urlLink 7N  show.  The show was  awesome !  I really had a great time.  I'd seen 7N once before and I didn't remember how awesome they were live.  The guys in the band were all pretty hot, so it was a visual treat as well ;)     Sunday  Alex and I got breakfast (well, brunch, really) at Quintessence and then we hung out for a bit before heading up to Clifton Park to see  urlLink The McKrells  and  urlLink The Glengarry Bhoys  at  urlLink Northern Lights .  That show was  awesome  as well.  The Mckrells went on before Glengarry, and they were pretty good, but they're not really my thing.  I mean, I like them enough, but they're kind of like good background music for me.  Then Glengarry went on and they put on a great show as always.  I had a blast!  For the encore Glengarry came out with the McKrells and they did a couple of songs together and it totally rocked.  I totally didn't want the night to end.  But it did.  Sigh.    And now I'm still exhausted from the weekend.  But what an awesome time!  We took a lot of pictures (Alex is too funny when he's got his drunk on and he's got the camera...  there are a lot of really random pictures...).   urlLink You can view the pics from this weekend here .    So I was about to go to bed just now, and the Howard Stern TV show came on E (I'd been watching some E True Hollywood Story or something like that) and Jimmy Fallon is the guest and like the first thing Howard asks him is what his background was and Jimmy said that he's 27 and that he'd actually gone to college after high school and that he'd gone to  urlLink the college of st rose  here in albany.  And then they said it was an idiot school.  I'd have to agree.  (I did attend for a semester for graduate school and it wasn't exactly challanging.   at all .)  He'd been going for CompSci and he said that there was a "real school" right across the street and he was referring to  urlLink sunya  and i think it's weird that he'd go to St Rose and pay all that extra money to attend, essentially, an idiot school for compsci when he admitted that suny is a "real school" and it's a state school and it's pretty much right across the street from state rose.  ah well.  i guess that doesn't matter, especially since he's famous and it's got nothing to do with what he went to school for.    anyway.  goodnight.

      I thought that I had nothing to do this past weekend and that I was going to be bored.  Fortunately, that turned out not to be the case.    Saturday night was Foster and Amy's housewarming party.  We trecked up to their place - really, a long drive, but always worth it :).  The party was a lot of fun.  Alex played bartender for a bit and I got drunk.  We ended up staying the night in their spare room, which was very cozy.  Foster made breakfast the next morning: apple cinnamon pancakes and scrambled eggs with cheese.  It was delicious.    On the way home Alex spotted a plume of smoke rising somewhere out of the Troy area so he decided that he needed to go find the fire.  We drove around for a bit and found it in Watervliet.  Apparently some sort of old factory was burning.  The fire must've been huge and smoke was just filling the streets (at one point it was kind of hard to see to drive).  We found a good vantage point where other people were also pulled over to watch the fire.  What's up with that, really?  People were getting out of their cars, walking over to eachother and pointing and I'm sure they were saying things like, "well, that's a big one," and, "that building is a hazzard," and "those firemen are doing it all wrong, they should be spraying over  there ."  I took a few pictures with my phone's camera:            After we'd watched the fire for a few minutes we drove back to my apartment where we got busy cleaning.  I did the huge, disgusting pile of dishes and went through the mounds of mail covering my desk and table while Alex cleaned out the cubby in the porch that the cats had apparently been using as a spare litter box.  Ew.  It was really nasty, but Alex did a great job cleaning it out and now I can use it to store my huge rubbermaid tote filled with all my Christmas decorations.  Yay!  We got a lot of cleaning done and I feel  much  better about my apartment now.  All I had left to do was the laundry and the floors.  I got the laundry done last night (was at my parents' house from six until midnight!) and I'm planning on doing the floors tonight after my Weight Watchers meeting.  And then my little place will be perfect and I can relax.  Rock!    Good times.

       I'm Old.   My eyes kept wanting to close as I drove to work.  I'd passed out early on the couch last night, so it must have been my persistent cold that kept me tired.  As I stopped at a red light, all I could think was how I must have had huge bags under my eyes, so I flipped down the visor and slid open the mirror.    My eyes actually didn't look so tired, but my hair looked crappy.  It was raining out, so of course my hair was becoming frizzy as it dried.  I was about to slide the mirror closed when I caught a glimpse of something sort of shiny in my hair.  I looked closer and realized that it wasn't shiny, but white.  I reached up to get out what must have been a rogue feather from my feather bed but when I grasped hold of the white thing I realized that it was something much worse.  It. Was. A. Grey. Hair.    I panicked and ripped it out of my head and brought it close to my face to confirm the horrible truth.  When I finally grasped the fact that it was, indeed, a grey hair I panicked again.  I ripped it out!  Isn't that bad?!  Isn't there some old saying or rule or something that says that you shouldn't pull out a grey hair because you get, like, a million back in it's place?!?!  Shit.    Then someone beeped behind me, obviously irritated that the traffic light had turned green more than 5 seconds ago and I hadn't moved yet, shaking me from my silent terror and causing me to focus some of my attention on the road.  The offensive hair remained in my hand the rest of the way to work.  I didn't know what to do with it.  I felt like if I dropped it in my car I'd lose track of it and it could attack me again at any time.  My mind was racing.  How do I prevent more from coming back?  Maybe I should try and stick this one back in and it could act like a frightening effigy to scare off others from coming: see what you'll get if you come here?  You'll be ripped out and die!!    I figured that plan probably wouldn't work though and that I'd just have to resign myself to the fact that I'm old.  It's all downhill from here.  Who knew that your life ended at 25?  Now I'm on that slippery slope, speeding towards my worst nightmare:  I'm going to wake up one day and I'll be my mother.       The offensive hair.

       never a dull moment...   so i thought this would be a quiet weekend...  (this is a crazy long post)  my plan for friday night was to keep it quiet and go to bed early because i had to take the NYSP test the next morning.  the night did pretty much go as planned.  alex and i went to delmonico's for dinner and then caught a movie at crossgates:  eternal sunshine of the spotless mind .  i loved that movie.  it was just so, so good.  jim carrey was awesomely likeable (lately, i much prefer him in serious roles because that whole wacky-off-the-wall-crazy stuff gets annoying), and kate winslet's character didn't get annoying as i feared she would.  sitting there in the theater, the movie gushed from the screen and flowed over me, totally enveloping me.  i realized at one point that i was sitting there watching the movie with my mouth just hanging open.  it was one of the most interesting and enjoyable movies i've seen in a while.  when alex and i left the theater, all we could say to each other was how great the movie was.    saturday morning i got up bright and early and showered while alex made me a power breakfast (egg beaters on 1/2 a low carb bagel with some catsup - 2 points and it keeps you full for  hours ) and then rushed over to the NYSP Academy to take the test.  i arrived exactly at 8:30 (when the admission notice said to get there) and after i checked in, i was given a survey to fill out while i waited for the test to begin and was directed to the cafeteria.  i'm very glad that i finally updated my driver's license with my new address (notified the DMV and wrote the new address in the space provided in the back) because the trooper that checked me in definitely saw that the address on my license didn't match the address on my admission notice and flipped over my license right away to see if it was updated.  you're supposed to do that within ten days (oops, was a year and a half...) and it's definitely something you can get ticketed for, so i would've felt like  such  a tool if it wasn't updated and he'd said something to me.  i waited for about an hour before the test started.  the test was very easy (i don't think i missed any questions) and it took me about 45 minutes to complete it.  i was one of the first people to leave the cafeteria.  that didn't surprise me, though.  i'm an annoyingly fast test taker.    i went back to the apartment where i found alex at work cleaning the dishes, which motivated me to do some chores: changed the sheets/made the bed, picked up clothes off the floor and cleaned the bathroom.  when we were sick of cleaning, we decided to go to lunch.  i convinced alex that since it was  such  a beautiful day (about 60 degrees and sunny) we should walk to a local restaraunt.  we ended up walking by washington park on state street (which is the really nice side of the park).  there were a couple of "for rent" signs and we recorded the phone numbers...  hey, you never know.  i want to call some of them and see how much the rent is and take a look at them.  my lease is up at the end of july and i'm looking around to see what's out there.  i love my apartment and might just end up staying here, but it never hurts to look.  "i'll look to like, if looking likeing move."  the buildings around the park (on that side of the street) are  so  freaking cute.  i'd love to live in one of them.  the only prices we saw were for studios (around $525 - $545) and there was one, one bedroom apartment that had a price on it - $800.  of course, that was in a building that had a penthouse at the top that went for $2500...  here's the notice that was in a window of that building:       we saw another notice in a building on state street that looked promising: a one bedroom with a view of the park that had a marble fireplace and a claw foot tub for $590/month including heat and hot water and DSL... but it wasn't on state street, it was in #5 Henry Johnson Blvd.  that road connects the loveliness of state street and the park to the ghettoness of central ave.  we went and looked at the building and it's just the very first building on Henry Johnson Blvd, right next to a large, beautiful building on state street, but it looked a little shabby in comparison.  alex walked up and opened the front door (a little disturbing... i thought it was a secured building) and the foyer was dark and dirty looking.  i was immediately turned off but alex thinks i should call the number and have a look at it.  and i think i might still.  it never hurts to look, right?  and if it's heinous, it'll just make me appreciate my apartment that much more.    but, oh, the buildings in that area are just so lovely.  they're all mostly from the late 1800's/early 1900's and they're just awesome.  a few of them had interesting gateways to parking and other buildings in the rear...  here are a couple of pics:            so yeah.  we ate lunch at the Bleeker Cafe which is on Dove Street and then came back to the apartment, where one of us took a nap:       ;)    i got a disturbing call around that time from the wham.  she said that david had been in a car accident.  she assured me right away that he was ok, but she wanted to know the name and location of  urlLink dod's  dad's shop so that the could have the van towed there.  a few phone calls later she said that the van looks like it was totalled anyway, so they just had it towed to the tow yard. she said that the whole front end was wrecked and the airbags came out.  i was afraid that it was going to be david's fault - he is a 17 year old boy - but thankfully it turns out that it was the other person's fault.  I guess she made a left turn in front of him.  from the points of impact, it looks like she just pulled right in front of him.  how do you not see a large green minivan?  and it happened at like 4 or 4:30 so it was still really bright outside.  whatever.  i guess there's really no point in getting mad at the woman.  i mean, accidents happen.  of course, if my shitty (my nickname for david) was hurt at all i think my opinion would be different...  so yeah.  it looks like she pulled out to make a left in front of him and when they hit she spun around and hit the back of the van too.  here are some pics of the cars after they were towed:        The van...     Front of the van again...   Driver's side rear tire where the other car spun around and hit...   The other car....   ...other car...   ...other car again...   Yeah.  So the trooper at the scene gave my dad a copy of the accident exchange form with both drivers' info on it (name, address, insurance company code) and a brief little description of the accident at the top (not normally on one of those forms): V1 (other lady) failed to yield the right of way to V2 (david).  So it looks like the police report will reflect that.  i'm not sure if the lady got ticketed...  she should have, but she did ask for an ambulance and the trooper might have felt bad for her and not ticketed her.  it doesn't matter though.  she's still clearly at fault.  i looked up the insurance company by the code for my dad and he reported the claim to her insurance company.  they better treat him right.    Also, i don't know how people ever have kids and then let them do anything.  after i got off the phone with the wham and she'd told me what happened and that david was ok and everything, i still cried.  it was just so upsetting to think that something really horrible could have happened.  ugh.  i'm  so  glad he's ok!!!  saturday night alex and i went to the  urlLink Albany Pump Station  for dinner, and then met with Steve and Debbie and went to see  urlLink the burners  at northern lights.  it was  ass  crowded in there.  it was so crowded and hot that right in front of the stage where the largest concentration of people was, it was raining sweat.   how disgusting is that?!   so yeah.  it was a good time, though.  Dodi was there with some friends and i hung out with her for a bit.  i couldn't get drunk for some reason (I think it's because of my cold), so I was the DD that night for me and alex.    today, i met beck and dodi at ruby tuesday's in crossgates for lunch, and then we went to see a sneak preview of   urlLink the prince and me  .  it was a very sweet movie.  i don't think it ended the way it was originally supposed to end (it felt like the ending was sort of slapped on after where the movie felt like it concluded) but it was still good.    and now i feel like this post lasted forever.  but there's more...  i was browsing around the  urlLink times union site  to research cars for my dad to get to replace the van and i popped over to the "homesTU" part and started browsing through the houses for sale in the area.  I stumbled across a listing for this condo on the south east side of Albany...  here was the description:  "ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE,UNIQUE CONDO,2 BR/STONE QUARRY JACUZZI TUB,STONE WALL IN MASTER BEDROOM.TOTALLY ROMANTI 1 CAR GAR.COURTYARD,GATED ENTRY.SECURITY SYSTEM.GOURMET KITCHEN WHITE."  The numerous typos and random grammar are annoying, but the place sounded awesome.  and the building is just so unique...  here's the pic from the listing:       Yeah.  I fell in love with the building.  but the price was $87,500, and that seemed very inexpensive for the type of place that they were describing. so i decided to go play "in search of..." and i drove down towards the south east side of albany, going down Madison Ave, peering down every side street, trying to spot that really cool circular part on the top of the building.  and i actually found it right away!  It's on the corner of Trinity and Westerlo (sp?), in the "mansion" neighborhood of albany (named so because the governer's mansion is in that neighborhood)...  the circular part on top looks even cooler in person... like a crown on top of the building or soemthing.  but the neighborhood isn't really all that great....  it's right across the street from the schuyler apartments, and they seem very nice...  valet parking and doorman, so maybe it's not all that bad.  but as i drove up the street there were some youths on the street who felt the need to holler at me...  not very comforting.  I still want to go look at it.  Not like anyone would actually give me a mortgage, but it  would  rule, because i looked at current rates and if i got a 20 year mortgage the montly payment would be about what I pay now in rent...  but yeah.  it's really not like i could buy a place right now.  and considering my tendancy to get itchy when i stay in one place for very long it's probably not a great idea.  also, if, by some miracle, i make it into the NYSP, I could be sent anywhere in the state, so having a place that i owned probably doesn't make sense.  but it's a nice fantasy!  so that's it!!  no more typing for this post!  thanks for hanging in there and reading it!  :)

      felt like i needed a change and i figured the easiest way was to switch out the skin on my blog...  back to a maystar design...  i like the simplicity and the cuteness of this...  i'm thinking about doing a skin based on my beetle, but that'll take a little work and probably won't happen for a while (if ever)...

       Movin' On My Mind... Maybe...   I haven't posted in a while and it's because I've been obsessed.  I've been completely consumed with thoughts of moving.  My lease is up at the end of July and I'm exploring my options.  My goal is to decrease my monthly housing costs.  I really love my little apartment, but with rent, utilities, cable/roadrunner, and phone bills I pay about $750 a month just to live there.  And, that's really just about right on track with what they recommend you spend on living expenses compared to your income (it's about one week's pay before taxes), but with my other extreme debt, I think I should be spending less.   So I came up with a couple of options:  1. I could move home.  I mean, I could save $750 a month!  I could have my loan from the Pa and the Wham to pay off the credit cards paid off in just under 2 years!  Pa was all for this idea.  I think Wham was going to fall over when he suggested it though.  It was a very nice offer, but I can't move home.  Wham and I did not get along very well when I lived at home, and we get along awesomely now, so I'm thinking that moving home is not the best solution.  Also, there's no room at the inn anyways.   2. I could find a roommate and a 2 bedroom apartment.  I'm not a huge fan of living with strangers, but if it reduces the bills then it could be worth it.  And I could end up meeting someone awesome and gaining a new friend.  BUT...  I could end up with a complete freak...  And I'm really particular about my furniture and its placement and I'm sort of a control freak about that kind of stuff...  Also we'd have to have a 2 bedroom apartment that's acceptable to both of us and it could be a lot more expensive so when you split the costs it doesn't actually save all that much... 3. I could try and find a smaller/less expensive place.  A viable option.  But when I was looking for this apartment, I ended up choosing it because it was the least expensive not ghetto place I found.  I did just find a listing for a one bedroom apartment right on the park (on the non-ghetto-actually-very-pretty side of the park) for $425 which is $145 cheaper than what I currently pay in rent... But it's a 3rd floor walk-up.  And the parking situation by the park is heinous... And there's either something really wrong with it or it's tiny for it to be at that location for that price.  But I  would  absolutely love to live right on the park like that.  It's  so  beautiful there with all the historic buildings...   4. Alex could move in with me.  He works right in Albany and already ends up spending the night before he's got to be into work early in the mornings.  And if he moved in with me, we wouldn't necessarily have to get a 2 bedroom apartment, so I may be able to save more money.  We could, in fact, stay at my little apartment now, but he'd be bringing his large TV and stereo/gaming equipment and possibly a dresser or something like that and it could be a tight squeeze.  But still doable.  And I wouldn't have to leave my pretty near perfect little place.    I'm thinking that option 4 is the one that's most likely going to happen.  Alex and I talked about it and he's into moving in with me and that rocks.  So we can stay where I'm at, or we can try and find a little bit bigger apartment.  I don't want to spend too much more a month on an apartment because even though two of us could afford more the whole point was to save money...  Both of us would like to live by Washington Park in Albany because the buildings (on the good side) of the park are so pretty and the neighborhood is really nice.  But the apartments there are expensive...  We were walking by the park the other day and we saw a two bedroom apartment advertised that sounded promising.  It's a basement apartment and I think it said that heat and hot water were included but it didn't give the rent price...  I'm hoping that it'd be cheaper than most two bedroom apartments on the park because it is a basement apartment and those are usually cheaper.  I'm going to call and check that place out...  There are also these townhouses near where I live now that are 2 bedroom/2 floor townhouses with basements and washer/dryer hookups that are probably more practical.  They're about a hundred dollars more a month than what I pay now, which isn't too bad, but no utilities are included so those'd be more a month than what I currently pay because my heat and hot water is included with my rent.  It would be nice to have a place that felt more like a house... And it'd be awesome to have a washer/dryer in my place (after I save up for them...).  But we'll see.  I do really like my place now... Wherever I end up will have to be as cute and have as much character (or be a much better deal).    For a week I was obsessed with the thought of buying a place.  There's a girl in my department at work who's getting married in October and she and her fiance have been looking for a house and I started browsing through the listings and I found this little blue house in Albany and I fell in love with it:      It's way downtown towards the river in the "Historic Pastures" neighborhood of Albany.  It's a three bedroom 1.5 bath and it's adorable...  The listing price was $74740 which technically could be within my range...  I was completely obsessed with buying that little house and even figured out that, worst case scenario, my monthly cost of living in that house with rent, insurance, taxes, utilities, homeowners association fees... Etc...  Would be around $900.  That's really not bad... And only $150 more than I'm paying now in living expenses...  And really, I could technically swing that on my own (that's my rule...  I don't want to live in a place that I can't afford entirely on my own because I like to know that I can take care of myself)... But I'm trying to  save  money...  And I even though I was completely enamored by that house I made myself stop thinking about it.  I don't know yet what might happen with the NYSP...  So I should keep my options open and not commit myself to a house because really, unless you're in the house for at least 3 to 5 years you're not benefiting from owning compared to renting.  So, sigh...  No cute little blue house to match my cute little blue car...  Not yet...  ;)  So now I'm back to obsessing about if I should move and, if so, where...  Yesterday, this was my horoscope: "The possibility of moving out of your current neighborhood may have vaguely occurred to you in the past, dear Cancer, but events occurring today might have you finally making up your mind to do so. Perhaps too many good neighbors have moved away, or perhaps a rush of good fortune has made it possible for you to 'move on up.' Much has to be considered and decided before it happens, but if this is what you really want, go for it."  I was freaked out by how applicable that horoscope actually was to me...  But then nothing really happened yesterday that made me resolve to move out...  In fact, I got home after having worked overtime at work and I was really hyper.  My supervisor had bought us dinner and I got a Mountain Dew Code Red to drink and it made me completely off the wall crazy hyper (I guess that's not uncommon...  I was telling my fellow late-stayers that my stomach was feeling "flippy" which was how it used to feel in the early morning hours when I worked overnight shifts at the hospital and I'd always assumed that it was because I was up so late and now I guessed that it had to do with the Mountain Dew because I'd consumed that during the night shifts too and my one coworker, Matt, said that he can't drink Mountain Dew anymore because it causes anxiety and he once had a panic attack after drinking a bunch of Mountain Dew... But I'm like, way off track here...).  So I got home and I was still hyper and I put on  urlLink HGTV  and I couldn't just sit there and watch and I got inspired and I rearranged my bedroom:    Before   After  And now I really enjoy my bedroom.  And I can totally see how I could fit another dresser in there...  And where my TV would go....  Sigh.  I might as well just stay where I'm at...  It's less work, anyways...  And I  do  love the little apartment...  But then, I do love change and it's just so much fun to look (and to obsess)...    It's a conundrum.

      Just laughed at myself in front of the mirror.  Immediately stopped laughing.  My mouth looked enormous and I think my nose grew to about at least 8 times its size.  Also had about a billion wrinkles.  Thought occurred to me: when other people are laughing with me, they may actually be laughing at me.  Dismissed that thought.  If they looked at me while I was laughing, they'd scream in terror and run away.  Hmm...  ... Was practicing laughing and trying not to look like a fool.  Impossible.  Tried not opening my mouth, but that produced a severely goofy smile that was almost as scary as the open mouthed laugh...  ... If I put my head down when I laugh instead of throwing it back as usual it seems to diminish the size of my mouth and decrease the amount of teeth exposed...  ... Best solution: cover my mouth when I laugh.  If I forget to do that or my hands are unavailable, I'll demurely lower my head in Princess Di fashion.    Problem: solved.

      So  urlLink Dodi  just put a new skin on her blog and it's so freaking adorable!  I'm so jealous!  This should really push me to go ahead and make the skin that's been in my head for a while for this blog...  something very cute and slightly glamorous.  Like me.  ;)  Well...  I think I have the cute part down... I need to work on the glam...  and the modesty...  ;)  Oh!  So this is just going to be a quick little update/note because I'm drowning in work and I should be doing that and not this...  But what was I saying?  Oh, yeah.  I got a new haircut.  It's fab.  View it by clicking  urlLink here .  I'm very pink in that photo but I've been telling myself that it's because I was wearing a pink sweater and it's nothing more than a reflection of the sweater and not that I have annoying skin.    And I just need to post that I have an awesome boyfriend!  He cleaned my apartment for me yesterday and I so totally can't even say how much I appreciate that!  I was just getting so depressed with the hell-holeness of my place and I hadn't been able to start cleaning yet and yesterday was an awful day at work and I didn't even want to go home because it was such a hole and there was no way I could relax there but when I got home I found that he'd cleaned the cat boxes, done all the dishes, and taken out all the trash.  HE RULES.  Actually, he and Lee rule.  Alex was working yesterday and Lee was his partner and they wanted to hang out at the apartment and watch movies while they weren't busy and Alex knew that I'd be pissed that he brought someone else over to my apartment in the state that it was in so they cleaned my apartment.  I just can't even express how awesome I think that is.    But now I must get back to work.  And I promise to post something new and interesting soon...  :)

      so it was a journey getting to the airport yesterday.  i was hot and uncomfortable most of the way but once we got to JFK all the stress left and i've been having a great time ever since.    the drive down to poughkeepsie was long and hot.  huge trucks kept getting in the left lane and slamming on their brakes for some reason (I'm not kidding, this happened more than once).  there was construction on the thruway and construction on the bridge into poughkeepsie and that did not improve my stress level.  by the time we got on the train i was already hot and stressed.  the trainride was uneventful.  there was a group of drunk people who were especially annoying, but other than that it was a good ride.  we got off in grand central and headed across the street and ended up catching an earlier shuttle to JFK earlier than we expected.  the shuttle was full and i ended up sitting next to this guy who was fighting sleep the whole time.  his head kept bobbing up and down and i kepth thinking he was going to smack his head on the window and i really would have laughed at him.  we got to JFK around 7:30 or so and got through check in pretty quickly.  once we got up front we were told that we could have gone to the business class check in and didn't have to wait in line (oops, oh well...  my dad did tell me that but i didn't see it when we first got there so...) and then we were directed to the business class lounge.  flying business class is totally worth it.  well, actually, i have no idea how much it costs, but getting upgraded by dad to go was definitly worth it...  the lounge in JFK was very nice.  we walked in and there was a self serve bar with assorted beers, wines, and liquors and some snacks there and plenty of couches.  we were told there was food out and we hunted around until we saw a door that said club world (business class) dining area.  we felt so freaking elite walking in there...  there was a buffet with three types of salad, three hot dishes, soup, rolls, and dessert.  I had the mixed baby greens salad with grilled eggplant, asparagus, and red peppers.  awesome.  the soup was an onion/three ale soup which was  awesome .  for dinner i sampled each of the three entrees: chicken with shitake mushrooms (freaking amazing), seafood stew (not as great as the chicken, but still very good), and a roasted veggie torte (very good).  the dessert was a dark chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce.  very, very good.  we had guinness with dinner in honor of our trip.    they'd been anouncing in the lounge when to board the plane and when it got to be 9:45 and we hadn't heard anything yet for our 10:00 flight we checked the screen to see if there'd been a delay.  yeah, there was no delay and they were on the final boarding call.  we hurried to the gate and made it aboard with plenty of time.  the seating on the plane was  awesome .  we sat on the upper level and felt like superstars.  the seats were grouped in twos and they faced each other, almost like those old fashioned courting seats.  there was a fan-like partition that you could pull across for privacy and little LED screens that flipped out so that you could watch tv or movies or play games (nintendo-like).   there was this channel that showed you exactly where the plane was at all times (like an Indiana Jones map) and it gave you information about the flight time, the temperature, estimated time to land and what the local time was.  it was so freaking cool.  we were fed again on the plane.  i've never eaten so much.  and they kept offering you more food.  so freaking awesome.  there was a little drink tray that flipped down from near where the tv flipped out and your tray flipped out of your armrest.  you could lay the seats all the way down into a bed position and i've never slept better on a plane.  so freaking awesome.    when we got to London we had to get on a bus to get to the terminal and then wait in a  longass  line to go through passport control.  there was this announcement that seemed to be on a 2 second loop that kept saying if you were a european passport holder you were to stay to the left and follow the signs.  it took us nearly an hour to get through the line.  and everyone (including us) smelled.  it was most unpleasent.  after we picked up our bags we made our way to the arrivals business class lounge.  when we got here we took nice long showers and it feels so good to be clean.  we got some lunch (an english breakfast of eggs, super salty bacon, beans, and awesome hashbrown things) and now we're relaxing.  we still can't check into our hostel for about an hour, so i think we're going to make our way to the tubes soon and head that way.  it'll probably take us about an hour to get there anyway.    so the trip so far has ruled.  this was the "fabulous" portion.  now we're heading into the "ghetto" portion: public transportation and hostels...

      so i am totally peeing my pants about leaving today.    work blows and i wish that i just took this whole day off instead of a half day.  ah well.  i have crap to do when i get home before i can leave for poughkeepsie, but i've got about 2 hours between when i get home from work and when i have to leave and i should be able to get it all done.  i totally have my typical nervous stomach feeling that i have before i travel.    ugh.  it doesn't really feel like i'll be on my way to europe tonight because i'm sitting here at work like it's a normal day...  weird.  well, 2 hours until i get to leave work... then it's home to take care of the cats, finish packing and get organized and then off to poughkeepsie.  i guess i'm meeting beck at her work (she says it's ok to leave the car there for the week...  i hope so, it'd suck major ass to get back and find it towed or vandalized or something) and then we're heading over to the train station to catch the 4:30 train into Grand Central.    it's going to be a voyage just getting to JFK: a car drive of a little over an hour, a train ride of a little over an hour, a shuttle ride to JFK of around an hour...  and then sitting in the terminal waiting to go.  God, by the time we depart JFK tonight (supposedly at 10) I'm going to be a wreck...  and i'm already exhausted, i can't wait to get on the plane and sleep...

      oh where to begin...  it's been days since i've been able to post and i have so much to write about...   Tuesday in Dublin   so tuesday morning we got up kind of late and so that meant that the germans next door (there were at least 4 of them sharing the room next to ours that shared our toilet and shower) had all gotten into the shower before us and used up all the hot water again so we had cold showers.  i can't wait to get back to america and have a warm shower every day.  anyway...    so we walked to O'Connell street to catch the bus for the tour of the city.  it was a double decker hop on/off tour that stopped at about 20 stops all around the city.  we decided that this would be the best way to see most of the sites and we had read an article on the aer lingus flight on the way to dublin that mentioned that these tours were actually pretty good.  The tour headed off towards the wax museam at first where out front there's this huge celtic warrior breaking into the place.  it looped back around down O'Connell street again and passed the huge spire in the middle of the street that was erected for the millenium celebrations in the city and was, i believe, called the millenium tower.  we drove by the general post office (GPO), which was important in the easter uprising.    the first stop that we got off at was the trinity college stop.  we took a walking tour of the college which cost 9 euros.  our guide was Owen, a philosophy student at Trinity.  i think he was in his 3rd year, i can't remember.  owen did a very good job with the tour and handled questions from some other americans, who were very annoying and asking him all sorts of pointless questions, very well.  the tour ended at the old library where you could go in and view the book of kells.  the book was very impressive: beautiful with intricate celtic designs.  the colors were produced by hard to come by and natural things (blue was made with lapis and red was made by crushing up beetle shells) and the paper was made by stretching the skins of baby calfs.  the book is essentially a picture book of the new testament of the bible.  we didn't spend too much time viewing it as there were tons of rude people crowded around it and wouldn't really let you in at all.  and they were coughing, which was so gross...  we walked upstairs to the long room of the library which may or may not be the longest long room of a library (they said it's bigger than the one at oxford but maybe not cambridge).  it was filled with very old books and other improtant document and was generally interesting but very stuffy and smelled of old books (and smelly other people).  the next stop that we got off at was the temple bar stop.  we thought we'd find lunch at one of the pubs in temple bar.  we didn't have luck.  we wondered around the area looking at the menus displayed in the windows and nixing each pub in turn as they were all very expensive in that area.  we finally decided that we'd try the Auld Dubliner, but found the service in there to be less than satisfactory.  we walked in the pub and beck asked if we could just sit anywhere and one of the girls behind the bar said yeah, so we walked behind the bar area and up a level to where there was a group of british kids having lunch.  and we sat. and sat.  no one came by to offer us a menu or see if we needed anything.  so after we sat there for at least ten minutes without being served we decided to abort.    we walked around again for another ten or fifteen minutes before we found the Stag's Head on Dame Court (i think...).  this bar was recommended to us by Glen at the Hairy Lemon - he said that it was one of the oldest pubs in dublin and definitely worth checking out...  (will finish later... my 20 minutes at this computer are about up).

      just have a few minutes (less than 8 actually) to post left on this timed internet in the hostel lobby...  so instead of trying to go through everything we did tuesday and wednesday i'll just write for a bit about today and then get back to the tues/wed goings on when i have a little bit more time because that'll be a long post...  so today on our last day in dublin beck and i decided to just bum around a bit.  we walked back to the shopping district in grafton street and i was on a quest to find a sweater.  the weather has been cold here and i didn't really bring any long sleeved shirts, all i have with me is a light hoodie, just cotton like a t-shirt.  we walked in a million shops but most of the sweaters i either didn't like or they were too expensive.  i did buy a small change purse in a shop called oasis: it looks like an old fashioned/old lady change purse but it's bright hot pink satin.  we walked through this victorian shopping district which was pretty cool.  there were a lot of little stands selling random things.  lots of hippy type things.    then it started to rain.  we've been lucky because the past few days we've been here we've had no rain.  but today it started and it's icky.  and neither of us have an umbrella.  it rains kind of weird here.  it doesn't really rain in drops...  the whole air just gets wet all around you.  so you feel damp.  ick.  we were going to buy an umbrella but by the time we got around to it we were already pretty wet so we didn't figure there was a point.    we stopped in a chocolate cafe for hot chocolate which was excellent: very rich and creamy.  i guess it should've been for three euros..  at least you got a free truffle with it :)  after that we looked in a bookstore for a while and decided to head back to the internet place we like to post/check email.  on the way back we stopped in one of those tourist/gift shop places and i bought a Guinness hoodie because i was freezing.    the internet place was full so we ended up in the lobby at the crappy pay internet terminals.  and now i have less than a minute so i should wrap up...  heading to the airport shortly...

      just a quick post for now.  it's our last day in dublin and we've checked out of the hostel and stored our bags for the bulk of the day in the basement lockers at the hostel.  just popped into the internet cafe to check on information that my dad left us regarding a different place to stay in london.  we decided to take him up on his offer of booking us into a proper hotel for our night in london tonight rather than going back to the hole that is the Atlantic Paddington...  he's booked us into the ramada at heathrow and i can't wait to have a shower again that's not freezing (yeah, i forgot to mention that, but the showers in dublin have all been freezing).    THANKS DAD!!!!!!!  I LOVE YOU!  anyway, it's off to enjoy our last day in dublin and get some lunch (pub f00d ru1z).  i'll post more the next chance i get!  -ali

       Dublin: Sunday evening   so we travelled to Dublin from London Sunday afternoon.  We found Heathrow to be kind of confusing when we went to check in in the departures area in terminal 1.  There were desks for airlines all over the place, but no signs pointing in which direction which airlines were located, so you kind of had to just wonder around until you found your airline.  We had our passports ready when we got up to the counter and handed them to the agent at  urlLink Aer Lingus  along with our tickets.  She didn't seem interested at all in our passports, in fact, I don't think she even looked at them.  This was kind of shocking to us, especially at a huge airport like LHR, because you can't get anywhere at Albany airport without a photo ID.  We weren't sure when we were checking in if we had business class seats again, so we were pleasently surprised when the ticket agent handed us our boarding passes and said, "you may use the lounge."  #  We practically skipped to the gate, giggling, and saying to each other, "you may use the lounge!"  When we got to the entrance to the gate area they asked to see our photo ID, but they didn't check it against the tickets.  We had to go through the security screening: the typical xray machine and metal detector and a female guard patted me down.  No one patted Beck down.  I guess I either look more sinester than Beck, or they figured that I had cargo pants on and therefore more places to hide things or that guard thought I was cute and wanted to pat me down....  (shudder).    The lounge at LHR for Aer Lingus wasn't half as impressive as the BA lounges that we visited.  It was a big room with lots of comfier chairs than were out in the regular waiting area at the gates and you had to show your boarding pass to get in.  There was a TV in the corner but some business man already had a hold of it and was watching track and field events (that's really a kind of boring thing to watch on tv...).  On the other side of the room there was a bar area with free alcohol and that was cool.  I poured myself a nice glass of Bailey's with ice and beck had some wine.  We sat around for about 45 minutes and then it was time to board the plane.    Aer Lingus's plane was not so impressive either.  Again, we've really been spoiled by BA international business class flights.  Business/First class consisted of the first three rows of the plane.  We were seated in seats 3a and 3c.  We were kind of confused as to why they wouldn't seat us right next to each other, but that was explained right away when we saw row 3...  3c (Beck's seat) was next to the window.  3a (my seat) was next to the aisle.  In between 3a and 3c was (of course) 3b.  3b was tiny.  I think it was less than half a seat wide.  there was a matching tiny pull down tray on the seat in front of it.  It was really the strangest seat I ever saw on a plane.  I don't really know what it was for...  I guess it's a child seat, but how many times do you see little kids travelling in 1st/business class?  strange...    anyway, the flight was nice.  we had to wait forever to take off, and there was a delay when we got on the ground as well, but as we had nowhere important to be that didn't bother us.  we were fed deli sandwhiches on the flight out of a little bag that said "premier" on the front of it.  Also in the bag were creamer and sugar for the coffee they offerred, a small bottle of water, a plastick knife and spoon, a fruit cup and a chocolate bar with honeycomb pieces in it.    Dublin airport was the least impressive so far.  when we got off the plane it wasn't clearly marked who should go where.  there was a passport control area, but they didn't seem concerned that we actually went there, and when Beck and I found our way into it the agent pretty much yawned, didn't really look at my passport when I handed it to her, and kind of mumbled something about how long we were going to be staying in the country.  Then we went down a hall to the baggage area and after we got our baggage off the belt (and this part of the airport was the least impressive...  it looked like Albany Airport during their remodel) we walked to the beginning of a hall where you had to pass through 1 of 3 channels.  the 1st one was the blue channel, and that was pretty much for citizens of ireland and anyone with a EU passport.  the second was the green channel, which was pretty much for everyone else.  the third was the red channel, and i think if you classified yourself as red they jumped you when you walked down the hall and that's how they caught any terrorists or whatever trying to enter the country.  after we figured out which channel we should go down we walked down the short hall and were dumped out into the arrivals area along with everyone else.  we couldn't believe how lax they were with security in general...  no one really looked at our passports or made sure that they matched our tickets, and they didn't even ask the baggage questions when we checked our bags, they just had a sign up that said that if we answered yes to any of the questions (had we left our bags unattended at all or had someone else packed our bags) it was our responsibility to tell the agent.    anyway.  so we found our way onto an airlink bus that took us to city centre.  we were dropped off near the bus station.  it wasn't obvious though which building was the bus station.  beck and i and a couple that also got off the bus were kind of left there wondering around trying to figure out (1) where we were and (2) how to get to our hostel.  i flagged down a couple who was passing and had a map and we found our way to the issacc's hostel.  this hostel is  much  better than the hole we stayed at in London.  it was down a cute alleyway and in an old wine storehouse.  the lobby area inside was full of international travellors eating and talking and playing cards and there was a courtyard to the left with the same occupancy. the guy at the desk was nice enough and he bothered to explain where breakfast was and other important things (unlike that annoying French Tool in London).  Our room had two single beds in it and a closet.  In the same vestibule area that our room was off of was a toilet/sink room and a shower stall room.  everything looked clean and appeared to be in working order.  we were so thankful to be in a place that wasn't a hole, especially because we were going to be there for 4 nights.    since it was after dark and we had no bearings of the city yet beck and i decided to spend our first evening in dublin just hanging out at the hostel and planning the rest of our stay here.  we went down to the lobby where there were these little pay internet terminals (1 euro for 15 minutes) and we tried to check email and I was going to post, but they didn't work very well.  we took a walk down the street later that evening and foudn this place that i'm posting from now (2.50 euro per hour plus software that works with hotmail and blogger).  we grabbed some chips from the vending machine and went back to the room to plan.  the chips we got were called "Taytos" and we got 2 flavors: onion and cheese and vinegar.  the onion and cheese chips somehow tasted just like Chicken Ramen.  I loved them.  after we pigged out on our chips and devised a skeleton plan for the next day we went to bed...     Dublin Monday   Monday we decided that we'd just wonder around the city and do some shopping.  First we had to buy beck a towel, which we did at a shop right around the corner from our hostel on Talbot street.  we think they ripped her off, because they charged her 8.99 euro for a plain white towel, and that didn't seem to be any of the prices that they had listed near the towels.  whatever, she needed a towel and she got one.  After we brought the towel back to the hostel we walked the same way up Talbot street towards O'Connell street.  We looked in the shops, including Clery's which is apparently Ireland's oldest department store.  We made our way up O'Connell street towards the Grafton shopping district.    We wondered around the Grafton Street Shopping District for a while before we got very hungry and focused our attention on finding something to eat.  We wondered around forever looking at the menus in all the windows of the various restaurant and pubs looking for somewhere that'd be suitable to have our first pint of Guinness in Ireland at.  We settled on the  urlLink Hairy Lemon .  The inside of this pub was dark and the furniture was mismatched.  Beck and I decided on a table behind the bar area almost underneath a flight of stairs and next to an almost hidden fireplace.  Our waiter was a friendly guy named Glen and he got us started with our pints while we figured out what we wanted to order.  I ordered a cheeseburger and beck got a chicken burger.  The food was ok (i didn't really enjoy the meat of the burger, it was very dry) and the beer was excellent.    what they say is true: the guinness here is better than the guinness in america.  it's smoother, less bitter.  it's  awesome .    turns out Glen knew where Albany was because he'd worked in Long Island for a summer or two and he wanted to get back to America so he could be an actor.  Glen said that he missed peanut butter m&m's the most from America, which I thought was kind of random.  At the end of our meal Glen produced a little handwritten list of things that we should see while we're in town.  Glen ruled.  Beck and I were thinking that we might send Glen a bag of peanut butter M&M's: "To Glen, c/o the Hairy Lemon, Dublin."  We headed up towards the Jameson Distillery after lunch, which was on the North West part of town and kind of a hike from where we were.  The distillery tour was interesting, guided by a nice young man named John.  There was this woman on the tour though that kept coughing, which really was grossing us out, especially at one point when she kept turning around and coughing on Beck and then looking at Beck like she was the one being rude (I was almost hysterical laughing...  really hard to keep that in sometimes).    At the end of the tour we were given a free glass of Jameson Whiskey.  I'm not sure how people (Alex) can drink this stuff.  I mean, it was ok after the ice we put in it melted a bit, but it's really something that I think has to be mixed, like, in a coke with lemon or something.  we visited the gift shop briefly after the tour before making our way back to the hostel to drop off our purchases before going to eat.    Before we ate we stopped here to post for a bit, and we were delayed from eating for over an hour while I typed the previous posts and by the time we got to the pub where we were planning on getting dinner, the Knightsbridge at the Arlington Hotel, the kitchen was closed (at 21:20!).  We walked across O'Connell bridge to a local fast food place, Beshom's, which served a fast food version of fish and chips.  the meal was actually pretty good: served on real plates with real silverware a nice big piece of fried fish and a generous helping of fries (which we promptly sogged up with malt vinegar) and a big pile of peas (that tasted wonderful here, much better than any peas i've ever had before) along with two slices of bread and butter.    after dinner we went back to the Knightsbridge where we had a couple of pints while enjoying some irish dancing and afterwards a short trad session.  people are so stupid, and most of them left after the dancing.  beck and i enjoyed the music though.  the band was small, consisting of a guitar player a fiddler (i think) and a keyboardist.  they played a few songs that we knew, but they did more talking than singing.  the bar closed early...  the music was over by a little after 11 and by 11:30 they were putting the chairs on the tables.    all the pubs close early here.  by 12:30.  it's very strange. people are starting their night out already at 8:00, whereas at home on a friday night i wouldn't even know if i had plans yet for the night by 8...  strange.  kind of hard to get used to, because i feel like a loser getting back to the hostel around midnight, but there's really no where to go (well, i guess the dance clubs might be open later, but those are gay, i prefer pubs and live music).    so yet again i've spent over an hour posting and my hands are getting tired.  i'd like to post about yesterday, but i'm just not up to it...  i'll write more when i get a chance i guess :)

      beck just informed me in the prior post that i got the address for the hostel wrong again.  it wasn't queensway, or queens gate.  it was queens gardens.  i blow.     london sunday morning   so we woke up at about 9 or so sunday morning because breakfast was until 10.  we used the toilet (ew, that thing wouldn't freaking flush the whole time we were there) and the shower which was a room that was just a stall behind the door to the hall.  no division or anything.  there was a scummy curtain, but it was all mostly unhooked.  there was no place to put your clothes or hang your towel.  and the drain was mostly clogged...  2 little holes were unclogged and while you showered it would randomly make this ominous gurgling sound.  anyway, so after that we headed down for breakfast.  breakfast was a scene.  all the freaks that were staying there were in line or in the dining area and it was hot and smelly.  people smell in europe.  and that's gross.  next time i come here i'm going to bring small samples of deoderant to hand out to people.  anyway, it was nearly 10 by the time we got to the front of the line.  we each grabbed a hard roll and some butter or marmalade and we rounded the corner to find that there were cornflakes in a big bowl but no bowls to put it into and no milk.  there were also no cups for juice/coffee.  when someone asked a staff member passing by about it he said he wasn't allowed to put anymore out because it was ten.  we put our plates down and snuck a knife out along with our rolls and went up to our room to eat.  this was not a satisfying breakfast.  we threw the knife behind one of the beds and packed our shit to leave.   we lugged our shit down all those flights of stairs and went to check out.  beck turned in our key along with the cards they'd given us the first day and asked if there was anything else she had to do and the dumbass girl behind the counter said yes, and then looked at beck like a freak when she remained standing there and told her she was all set.  so we left.    we went to paddington station and left our bags at the excess baggage stand there.  we dropped 5 each bag, but it was worth it not to carry our shit around or have to go back to that shithole before we had to again (yeah, we're staying there again thursday...).    we decided that we'd go shopping and that we wanted to go to Harrod's so we took the tubes to knightsbridge and got off to find that harrod's is closed on sundays.  ah well.  so we looked in the windows and then took a walk in that neighborhood and looked in some of the shops.  we passed a sign that had "chard" written on it which cracked us up so we took a picture.  we also took a picture of one of those tiny mini european cars that crack us up.  i totally want one.  some of them are convertable: you can roll the cloth top back...  we don't know what they're called, so beck came up with a "pug".  i need to import one.  then i can have a pug and a bug.  :)  we ended up eating at a restaraunt on that street, the Shanghai Knightsbridge.  the food was  excellent .  beck had the kung po chicken and i had the chicken with cashew nut.  it was the best ever.  seriously, i loved it.    we headed back to paddington station after that.  our train got stuck a couple of times on the underground which was hella annoying because there were these obnoxious girls on it (probably between 12 and 14 y/o) who kept singing "i love my auntie, my auntie lola!" and laughing and just generally being obnoxios.  i wanted to smack them.  they got off at Notting Hill Gate and we were so thankful.    so London was ok.  the buildings were beautiful and the transportation system was easy to use.  things were generally expensive, but you expect that in a big city.  what we didn't expect was that there was, like, no one out on the streets saturday night.  i guess we were probably just in the wrong area for it, but it was so weird.  the streets were almost deserted.  very odd.  anyway, it was a good time even though people stank and our hostel was kind of a hole...

      so i finally found another place to post from...   london saturday afternoon   so beck and i travelled into london saturday afternoon from heathrow airport via the heathrow express.  we'd come into terminal 4 and were going to have to leave from terminal 1 the next day so rather than leave our baggage at heathrow at the excess baggage counter in terminal 4 for 5 each and then pay the 4 each to ride the tubes we thought we'd just take the comfy express train and pay a little more.  i don't think we'll be doing that next time we're in london because lugging our bags from paddington station to the hostel wasn't so awesome.  live and learn.  but the heathrow express was pretty cool: clean with little tvs that showed snippets of BBC news and odd british commercials and little clips on where to go while in london.    when we got to paddington we realized that we really had no idea how to get to the hostel.  we asked some dude at an information desk who had to consult a map and seemed really unsure but he pointed us in the right direction for the address that i gave him.  too bad i gave him the wrong address.  i told him we needed to get to 1 Queensway, when it was 1 Queens Gate that we needed to get to.  oops.  we walked all the way to Queensway and when we got to #1 and it wasn't the hostel (it was like some random commercial building) i almost paniced.  i checked the address in my palm and realized that i gave the guy the wrong address and that i'd led beck all over london (it seemed like we walked forever).  so i looked up and beck and said, "ok, please don't kill me but...  i gave him the wrong address..."  neither of us had a map, so we looked at the one in the underground station that was right next to #1 and realized that we weren't too far off, but that the hostel was much closer to paddington station and we'd pretty much passed right by it.    so we walked back to the hostel and when we got in there beck went to the counter to check in.  the guy behind the desk was french and he kind of seemed very... snotty/trendy.  she told him that she had a reservation and gave him her name: "it's knowlton with a 'k'".  so he looked through his paper and said, "i don't have a reservation for you" so she said again, "it's knowlton with a 'k'", and this time he said, "oh, with a 'k'" and started looking through his sheets again.  beck and i exchanged glances: "what a tool" and then he inormed her that he still didn't have a reservation for her.  beck turned on the bitch immediately and was like, well i made the reservations over the internet and put down a deposit and started to go through her stuff to get the reservation number that she'd printed out.  what was most annoying about this fucking french tool was that he just really didn't seem to care that she'd made a reservation and put a deposit on the room and they'd fucked up.  we were so irritated.  beck was like, find me a room!  she'd booked a private two bed room.  they finally came up with a room for us: a four bed room that'd be a private, number 325.  he made us fill out sheets with our information on it and gave us these little cards that said that we were guests at the hostel with our room number on it.  he then gave us the key to the room and informed us that everytime we left the place we'd have to turn in our key and we'd be able to get it back by showing that card to the person at the desk.  we were not happy with this situation.  i mean, if someone got a hold of your card they could just go in and request your key.  whatever.  we were annoyed at the shitty people at the desk but at least we had a room.    we made our way back to the sleeping area and began climbing the narrow stairs.  the higher we got up, the shittier everything looked.  and that wasn't great, because the lobby was kind of shabby.  we kept climbing, i think we were on the 3rd floor or something...  we definitely climbed many stairs.  and there were two sets of stairs per flight and it was so narrow that if someone was climbing up with baggage someone couldn't be going down at the same time.  fortunately beck and i have great senses of humor...  we were hysterical with laughter as we were climbing the stairs, laughing so hard that it was difficult to climb the stairs at the same time.  some woman asked beck if she was ok and she was laughing too hard to answer which kind of annoyed the girl, i think.  when we finally got to the floor where our room was (amazing that we found it, there were no signs pointing out which rooms were where) we spilled out into the gross hallway still laughing.  we walked down the hall past a bathroom which was out of order and rounded a corner to find our room, which was right next to the shower stall and bathroom.    we opened the door and found our room not to be as filthy as we expected, but not a great place either.  there were two bunk beds on either side of a large window that had a dirty, holey sheer and two old drapes on either side of it.  there was a sink in the room with a mirror that randomly had the bottom part blacked out and another full length mirror mostly covered by one of the bunkbeds.  beside the other bunkbed sat a crude wooden shelf unit.  in front of the window was an old, dirty chair.  we sat our stuff down and laughed for about five minutes while we marvelled at the foulness of the room.  we set to work putting our sheets on our beds so that we wouldn't have to sit on the filthy sheets that were on the bed (actually, they didn't  look  filthy but from the state of the place you couldn't help imagining what you couldn't see on the sheets).  we chose to sleep on the top bunks because we reasoned that the bottom bunks would catch any filth falling off the top bunks.    we hung out in the room for a bit before we decided to venture out.  we took the underground to the tower stop so we could see the tower of london.  we got there pretty close to 17:00 so we decided not to try and go inside but just to take pictures from the outside.  then we wondered over to the tower of london monument where we took some pictures of the top of a private building across the street from it, 10 Trinity Square, because it looked hella cool.  we wondered around for a while and stumbled across St Magnus the Martyr Church where i took a picture of a tiny door that looked like you'd stuff torture victims into and a 2000 piece of wood next to it (leftover from the romans).    we followed the signs for london bridge expecting to be able to take pictures of some awesome looking bridge.  we were dissappointed when we found it...  it was just a bridge...  we looked to our left and discovered that that awesome looking bridge in all the pictures of london was the tower bridge so we walked back towards that to take some pictures.  then we wondered around some more and ended up going to Shakespeare's Globe theater where we rested on a low wall for a bit and took some pictures.  we decided that we were starving/thirsty so we walked down the path a little ways to the Tate Modern Museam.  outside there were these huge inflated figures: one was a blockhead and the other had a conical pointy nose.  we took pictures and decided to check out the collection inside (called "cruel and tender") because it was free.  we didn't get far because we saw the tate cafe and decided to stop there and eat.    our first experience eating in another country was kind of confusing.  we weren't sure of what the choices on the menu were and were self-concious about ordering and using pounds.  beck got a meatball dish and i ordered a potato omelet.  we both got cokes.  they are damn proud of their cokes over here because they charged us 2.10 each for them and they came out with just a small glass bottle and a glass with lemon and there were, of course, no free refills. they brought out our small dinners along with bread and mayonaise (what's with that?).  beck's meatballs were good until she realized that they seemed raw in the middle. we weren't sure if they were or not and we weren't sure if maybe they were just always cooked like that in London, so she didn't say anything.  my potato omelet ruled.  it was potatoes and eggs and veggies all cooked up into a solid-like dish.  very good.    after dinner we planned on heading straight back to the hostel.  but then i mentioned that we should go to buckingham palace and see it lit up at night.  so we went that way and discovered that they don't really light it up at night, but the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of it was lit up so we took pictures of that.  then we were going to go back to the hostel but we caught a glimpse of big ben in the distance so we walked that way instead and took pictures of big ben, a church at westminster abbey (can't remember right now what the name of it was) and the house of parliament.   then  we decided to head back towards the hostel.  and i got us lost again.  we walked forever.  the signs in london point to nowhere.  seriously, there was a sign for victoria station, where we were headed, and it pointed diaganolly, when there was no diaganal street.  rock.  not.  we walked forever.  we passed a bar called the Barley Mow which we were all excited about, but we didn't stop because we were  too  thirsty (needed water) and tired.  we talked about finding it again when we're back in london, but i can't really remember where it was.  i think it was horse ferry road or something weird like that.  we finally found victoria station and bought 2 cokes and 2 waters and went back to the hostel where we slept soon after.

      so i finally feel like working on this page again, and it looks like i need to pick up at...   Tuesday in Dublin...  Afternoon on...   right.  so it looks like i left off at the  urlLink stag's head .  so yeah.  Glen at the Hairy Lemon suggested that we visit the Stag's Head because it's one of the oldest pubs in Dublin.  it was also listed in a guidebook that i'd read and an article that my mom sent me.  so we figured it was worth seeking out.  it took us a while to find it, mostly due to my lack of navigation, but it was worth it.  we'd kind of given up the hunt when we walked randomly down a street and beck pointed at the building next to us and suggested that we just eat there.  we looked at the sign over the door and realized that it was, in fact, the stag's head.  it didn't look open...  the door was closed and there didn't appear to be much light issuing from inside the building.  we were about to just continue on when we saw someone push the door open and walk on inside.  so we did the same.  inside the pub we found the atmosphere to be exactly what you'd expect from the outside: preserved.  the bar looked like it's remained the same from the first day it opened its doors.    (oh, i would so desperately like to finish but i'm tired again.  hopefully i'll get to this tomorrow before friday night goings on start up...  i'd like to get everything down before i begin forgetting stuff!!)

      ok, so back to the Stag's Head...  SO...  we sat down next to a couple who were obviously tourists.  there was a day pack sitting on the bench next to the wife and a camera on the table.  turns out they were americans also...  i think they were from an "m" state for some reason, but i can't remember where... beck ordered lunch for us at the bar: she had the meatloaf and i had the fish and chips.  it. was. awesome.  that was the best fish i ever had.   awesome .  beck's meatloaf was apparently very good as well.  the staff there was helpful and very nice...  we practically inhaled the food because it was so good and we were so hungry...    and then we wondered down the road to Christ Church Cathedral.  which was beautiful.  we probably wouldn't have gone but it was one of the places that glen suggested we visit.  the day had turned gorgeous by the time we got there.  we took some pictures of the outside and were debating if we should go in... we wondered in to see how much they charged for a visit and the two little old ladies behind the counter kind of roped us into staying...  well, all they did was offer us pamphlets and we felt like after we took the pamphlets we were committed to paying and going inside...  they asked if either one of us were students and beck said, "she is" and i was like, um, yeah, i am and showed them my old student ID from SUNY Albany (for some reason they didn't put an expiration date on it...).  i paid a reduced rate and then felt a little guilty for lying in a church...  damn.  ah well.  anyway, it was beautiful on the inside, and i'm glad we went in.  ( urlLink see the pictures )  we went into the crypt and saw the treasures.  there were signs all around that said no pictures (with words and pictures) and still some dumbasses were snapping flash photos.  nothing irritates me more than rude, inconsiderate people.    after Christ Church we walked down the street to see St Patrick's Cathedral.  We didn't go in this one, but we snapped some pictures of the outside.  we hopped on the city tour bus and rode over to the  urlLink Guinness  storehouse.  we were informed that the storehouse was open until 10pm during the summer and that guinness provides a shuttle to the middle of town after the city tour busses stop running.  we arrived at guinness at about 4:15.  the last city tour bus left at 7:15...  we missed that bus and took the shuttle at around 9:30.  but hey, this was the inspiration for the trip so... yeah.    and i'm tired so it looks like guinness will be a post on its own.  i cannot believe that it's taking me this long to finish this blog.  suck...

      I've decided to change the thrust of this blog... Originally it was going to be just for my trip to Europe last summer, but since I wasn't all that successful in making that complete and I wanted to keep the blog, I decided to make this a blog that I can post to during any of my travels.  Since I'm still having this hosted on blogspot and not on my own server (where blogger has to FTP in and won't automatically publish when I email in posts), I should be able to update this blog using my cellphone - which is hella conducive to traveling.      Anyway.  So this blog won't really be updated all that often... just while I'm on trips.     My next mini-break will be next weekend, actually.  A quick trip to Pottsville, Pennsylvania for a family reunion.  Should be a good time :)  After that, there'll be another mini-break, this time to Fairfield, Connecticut for a friend's wedding.  And then... drumroll... Disney in September for a whole week!!!   I can't wait!!      Anyway, so yeah.  Mission Statement: just a blog to post from when I'm travelling.  Enjoy!  :)

        New haircut. Asked for mid neck length with side swept bangs. Got all shoulder length without bangs. Annoying. But I guess it still looks OK.

        The funny thing about this sign is the braile on it... Like some blind person is going to be walking near this wall and feel out this sign before they fall off.

      Do you think when they market a piece of furniture and they say that it holds 176 DVDs or whatever, that someone sits there & counts?

      Just sort of testing this theory... I'd like to use this page as a wireless blog for text messages and photos taken with my SprintPCS camera phone - a Samsung VM-A680... it's hella cool... can take 15 second video clips too, but I haven't figured out a good way to get them to post on here directly from the phone yet.    There's a great little site -  urlLink www.buzznet.com  - that I'd been starting to use as a photo blog, but it looks like they'll become a pay site soon(ish) and I'm not willing to pay for the photo blog. So, while buzznet has an advantage in providing a little thumbnail gallery on the side of all the images that I upload, I think that blogspot might work better... I mean, the photos that I take from my phone are all "throwaways"... little bits of instant gratification. So I don't think it'll matter that much to me if the ones from, say, a month ago aren't that easy to find.  And also, I can use this blog to post little wireless posts too, and not just pictures.      So we'll give it a go here.  Enjoy my "little bits of instant gratification"!
