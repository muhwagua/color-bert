      I am currently experiencing a lost of identity. I forget, more like I dont know who I am. I dont know why this has suddenly hit me but I was just thinking about this as I was painting my room. I think that your room should show who you are inside...unless you really dont want people to know that. So I was trying to ifgure out what to paint and I couldnt think. I was going to do a huge colage of just pictures of whatever but I have decide thats not who I am. I want to have a dream theme to my room. To show that I am a dreamer. but what of my dreams. I have no clue what to do, not to mention the time talent or money! especially the talent. If I could draw what was in my mind It would be beautiful.. I think. but othere then a dreamer who am I? Do I fit into a catagory? I have no style! nothing that makes people think ME!!! im no one. I am a lost teenager, serching for her soul...searching for who I am. but as of now I am traped, to much so to find out what makes me me! and I dont mean traped as in not allowed out of the house, but traped as in my mind is closed and I cant think. I know things that I am, like a dreamer, but who am I really? this is a very angging question. one day Ill find out. Until then I am simple experiencing a lack of Identity!

I decided that she was mean and that when she was old and craggedy that I was going to get her back for it. yes i will.....  well then i was wonderfully greated at the door by my beautiful wifey. and then..we went upstairs and there was paige. that was a super surprise. and then....i have alot of and thens. doesnt that get annoying? if so just let me know! (Erins eating tissue...btu we wont get into that.) so we went off to the beach when Azzy came to pic us up. wow its great to have so many great new friends. we went downtown and walked along the board walk all the way to city park and well, didnt really have anywhere to go from there. so there was a lot of sitting. we got bored of that and so we went back to erins. well just me and erin  but soon after e got bored and went back to Azzys. she has a fucking HUGE house!!! I was jealouse. very very jealouse. shes even got the huge pool in the back yard. grr. i want. then steve and tyson came over. ayh niki i was hanging with tyson. haha, hes fun to look at. kinda cute in a odd sorta way. hes a fun guy...surprisingly lazy! I say that we kiked the guys ass at pool. I was acctually the good player. i was so proud..and then when i made what would have been the winning shot, what did they do, say no it doesnt count cause i didnt call it.

      well today really was just another day. I hung out with justin up at his house most of the day. pretty normal. then went down to see Rusty and sheri and others. of course justin never really hangs around there long, he just kinda drops me there and then is always asked to take some one some where. so yah me and Rusty just hung out talking about different things. some where in there we started talking about me in a black leather out fit and that he like to see it, yah that sorta scared me a little. whatever. well then we headed over to celias so that justin could help Jordan with his car stereo. after taking it over to rusty's they found out that it was fried. my only real problem today was that i think that i was being lied to but there is no real way for me to prove it with out upsetting others. even though i have witnesses to the lie. i guess once again im just going to have to drop it. i hate doing that but well i really have no other choice. well anyways im gonna go cause im pretty tired. oh yah turns out that writting my secret in here was a great idea. geez im smrt. haha  byes

      Ok hmm I don't know why I have chosen to do this but I really think that I should. I have a secret, some people already know but I know a lot of people don't, some of the more important ones. I guess I haven't told those ones because I'm afraid of how they will react. *sigh* ok so yah here it goes. I know none of you will judge me. I am Bisexual.....  Yah I know surprising hey! The ones I've told seemed to see it coming, I guess they just pay a lot more attention to the things I say and do then others. Anyways yah that's all I really wanna say. So I guess ill leave it at that.

      i dont know why, but this week has nothing but depressing. lately it's been harder keeping the friends i already have, rather than trying to make new ones. i don't think they consider me as a friend anymore. in times like this, i just want to move away, and start all over.  i think i want to ask will out, despite the fact i think he's gay... but i'll feel like such an asshole in doing so, i hardly talk to him to begin with. why am i so lame?

(etc etc, i couldn't understand what they were exactly saying) me: um, our electricity is fine, thank you. telemarketer: oh, that is good. may i speak to the person who is responsible for the electricity bills in your home? me: sorry, no you can't. telemarketer: oh, well fuck you then. (then hangs up)  honestly, they must love their job. really.

      to end a crappy week; i have my english final exam, and my german.  they're both pretty easy, and even if i take a zero on the finals, i'll still pass with a B. friday's good though, i don't have any exams, so i'm going downtown with jaclyn. we're going window-shopping.  still on shitty terms with my parents, although they seem to be happy-cheery. i hate them so much. my dad doesn't want me going to calgary this summer, because he doesn't know tedi and her mom. which, he's wrong because he met her at the comp in kamloops. i don't know what i did to lose my parents trust so much, but they treat me like i'm fucking ten years old. i'm such a fuck up, my dad tells me to do something, and then three minutes later, he comes in and takes over. "you wouldn't have done it the way i wanted anyhow." fuck you. why would you ask me to do something, if you knew i was going to screw up?? like, i'm (almost) sixteen, and i doubt they're going to let me drive. heaven forbid they're going to have to  trust  me! they just don't understand that i can make my own descisions.  oh yeah, don't forget, no climbing until school's over! fucking parents. they think i spend too much climbing, and not enough time doing schoolwork. either that, or they tell me i have a problem.

      i cant stand this anymore. i hate my parents, and i cant wait till the day i can fucking slam the door in their face. they think im such a fuck-up, i cant do things properly, i'm not responsible because my room's never clean, they think i dont do my homework, and they think i'm ALWAYS on the fucking computer. the only time i'm on the computer, is when they're home. i can't stand being around them. i'm so glad they're not here right now. fuck, my dad didn't even give me money for the bus today, because i "didnt clean the house the way HE wanted it". i got the biggest lecture today about skipping class to belay groups at crux. they don't understand that it's not skipping out when i dont have a class. and basically, i have to ask them if i can work. honestly it's pathetic. they don't fucking trust me. i walked into crux crying, and that was rather embarrassing. I just wish my parents would back off, and leave me alone. so on sunday when i was supposed to clean the entire house spotless, and the patio, i didnt have time. i cleaned most of the house, and left a note promising to finish the next day. I got home yesterday and the patio was done. My dad said "you wouldnt have cleaned it the way i wanted it done anyhow." like fuck! why would you ask me to do it in the first place if you knew i would screw up like usual? he called me a snotty little bitch again today. that's not suprising.

      You speak with liquid fire Through lips of gold I've died enough for this already The angel of death will breathe you his life I loved you when you lived Blood in your mouth and in your eyes Tarnishing those golden lips Do you make your walls of your dead To protect your secrets? Or simply select a few to make others fear Do I really need this burning sword? Or is this the true battle  Held on ethereal plains of faith where I waited for so long for you I love you for what you are A distant star blinded by the unseen And I will always remember how you were Before this contention of disposition Know that I've always loved you For what you are and for who you've become Something I've always wanted to be Something unique.

"medio-core" by nofx, "psycho" by lower class brats, "caution" by operation ivy, and "salvation" by rancid.   3. Do you believe in Heaven or Hell?  I don't know, let me find out for you.   4. Do you believe in love at first sight?  I suppose it can happen, but I honestly don't think someone would fall in love with me just by looking at me. but then again, same goes with even getting to know me, i wouldn't think it'd be possible to fall in love with me.    5.

      I'm so flushed with all these emotions and I don't feel like they're going to stop circulating any time soon either. The excited/nervousy feeling when I talked with Fraser to the completely shafted feeling of be excluded (or maybe just forgotten about) of everyone's plans for Canada Day. I guess everything's all good now though. I think this entry would be a lot easier to write if I weren't so stoned (more or less at the burning out stage).   Anyways, the other day I hung out with John and we went up to this elementary school to meet with his friends Trevor and Andrew. We all shared a joint and talked about Andrew giving up his position at the Cherry plant for another job. I told him if John doesn't take the job then I will, so I really do hope that works out. I'm getting desperate for money. Later we came back to my house and my mom let John take her car to 7 11 for slurpees. Then we watched Final Destination 2. And I felt sick.  Ah, yesterday. Canada day. I went over to John's to watch Kill Bill for a bit and then into town to meet up with Meenoo, Mike and Dylan for some schnazzy hanging-out-age. It was a lot of fun, although we didn't break out the alcohol in time. Dillan and I shared some really nice pot though, and I saved some of my booze for next time. I spent the night at Meenoo's, which also reason why my night was cut a little short, and munched out while watching Conan. I love that man, he's the funniest shit ever.  I spent most of today doing errands and taking the transit back into Winfield and not even being home 20 minutes, John and Jake show up and are all, "hey wanna go smoke some pot?" Heh. We drove out to this foresty type place and to these mining caves to get our fix and then went down to the beach. Again, throwing rocks at eachother; but less violent this time. Finally, we went into Glenmore for Tim Horton's and munched out. It's so much fun hanging out with them. I love it.   I really gotta remember to bring my camera out to play more often. I've had so many "i'm a jackass" moments that could have been captured. Ah well. It'll be trés bitchin' next time, guys.

      Dear Internet,  My friends are in  love  and I'm jealous. Not jealous that they're in  love , but jealous that they're capable of having that feeling. That they can be flushed with such an emotion, and that it rarely retreats. It's too bad that I'm unable to possess that feeling. All I am left with is feelings of infatuation.  So what do you do if you feel like you'll never experience  love ? What if everyday you wonder what  love  even is for the rest of your life? I don't want to go out looking for  love . Because I know that if I do, I'll start making standards, and that's not what  love  is. Or... is it?  No, because as soon as you define what somebody has to have for you to fall in  love  with them in a completely commercialized, idealized, romanticised sense, you could miss the opportunity to be with somebody who could make you truly happy. Because you're not letting  love  find itself, but rather forcing it into the mold of what you think it should be.  ...Am I right?   Love , Kath

      Confusion in her eyes that says it all - She's lost control. And she's clinging to the nearest passerby, she's lost control. And she gave away the secrets of her past and said, "I've lost control again", and heard the voice that told her when and where to act. She said, "I've lost control again".  And she turned to me and took me by the hand and said, "I've lost control again". And how I'll never just why or understand. She said, "I've lost control again". And she screamed out, kicking on her side and said, "I've lost control again", and seized up on the floor -- I thought she'd died. She said, "I've lost control again". She's lost control again, she's lost control.  Well I had to phone her friend to state her case and say she's lost control again. And she showed up all the errors and mistakes and said, "I've lost control again". But she expressed herself in many different ways until she'd lost control again, and walked upon the edge of no escape and laughed, "I've lost control again". She's lost control again. She's lost control.  I could live a little there in the midst of the light. When darkness closed in I could have broke down and cried. I could live a little in the white of light. When the change is gone, when the caring's gone. To lose control when the caring's gone. Joy Division.

      Do I really have two sides to myself? Maybe it's not the typical two-faced kind of way, but there's a social side, and an intimate side. But the way some people make me feel, they make me think it's a bad thing. There's probably not much I can do about it anyways; why dwell on it? Because that's what Kath does.  Anyway, I talked to Fraser the other day, I think we're going to do something this week but I'm not too sure what. Maybe we'll have a picnic, and I can tell him my... "news" then. I really can't wait to see him though, he makes my day. He makes me laugh until my cheeks hurt and I'm crying. Maybe I'll talk to him tomorrow when we go back to get our report cards.  Sara came over last night, we just hung out listening to music but it was a lot of fun. I love having her over. I felt like I was kicking her out today when I made plans to go out with Jake and John. That's another thing that makes me feel like shit. I always feel like I'm making the wrong decisions, and when I do make them, I know I'm wrong, but I still do it anyways. Fuck this. Anyways after Sara caught her bus the three of us walked down along the railway and then got stoned. We sat around for awhile and threw rocks at eachother (well, mostly at Jake..). We made our way back to my house to eat and my dad was home. There's absolutely no way he can not know. There's been times where he's been suspicious of me, but I've never been caught. I think he chooses to not know.  After we ate, we went out again and bought fudgicles. Then Jake left and we got a ride back up to John's house to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It's a messed movie, but funny as hell. After I came home, I talked with my mom for a bit before going to bed. I love having conversations with her, it doesn't seem like we talk enough. And then it's weird when we do.

      It took me awhile to consider this, but I've decided to let this become public again. I'll try to keep this in an enlightened point of view, but somehow I doubt I'll be able to keep it up.  Summer's made it's entrance and I'm left with the empty feelings like I could have done better in school, and in life this year. I remember making goals last summer, and I don't feel like I've accomplished any of them. As hard as it is to explain, but I made a goal to find myself this year. And throughout the year I've felt like I had, but then something would happen and I'd be left right where I started. Searching. And the problems I've had with myself I've aimed to overcome, and in the process of doing so, I failed and lost something that could have been beautiful.  This is going to sound cliché and corny, but I don't know who I am. If someone were to describe to you, they'd be able to go as far as, "She's blonde, listens to Modest Mouse religiously and makes corny Jewish jokes." Shouldn't there be more? There probably is, but I can't seem to let it out for everyone but a select few to see. "She laughs at herself a lot as well." I feel like everything about me is insignificant and not even worth mentioning. I miss being younger, back when things were so much simpler; I was content just riding my bicycle and playing on the monkey bars. Fuck this cliché shit.  I feel like starting something new. Maybe an art project or something. I'll dedicate it to this year. All the memories from 2003/2004. I'm going to miss all you graduates. Another thing I'm going to miss is math every day with Fraser. Fuck those were good times. We used to goof off and tease eachother so much in that class, but eventually the teasing wore off and we became closer friends. I hope I never lose that. Ever.

      Yesterday I went out with my dad to test drive a new car. He's been thinking about buying this 2000 Mustang. Sure, it's a loveleh car and all, but I don't think we have that kind of extra money. But if he does buy it, he promised that he'd teach me to drive standard. Ha. Well, while we were out driving it, I saw a guy dressed in a semi-tight pink t-shirt walking down the street, and I laughed at him. Only until later did I realize I laughed at the drummer for The Trews.   9.  Go to a big concert   Anyways, we picked Lisa up and my dad dropped us off at the mall to catch a shuttle bus to the Bluffs for the Evanescence concert. We cruised through the mall a little and took more of those photobooth pictures (but we're going to go back and take better ones). We almost missed the shuttle to the concert, but then we didnt. Also, because the driver didn't know what was really going on; we didn't have to pay for our ride.  When we got to the concert, there were quite a few opening bands; I think some of them were locals too. One band, there were only three of them; they were called The Hecks. The guitarist played really well, and had the Mick Jagger lips. Lisa and I stood in second row and while Seether played, these two big guys (who must have been like seven feet tall) pushed us out of the way and stood in front of us. This girl next to us got really mad and flipped out at them and pushed them back out of the way. It was so funny. Almost as funny as the girl behind Lisa who kept bending over to re-arrange her folded blanket.  Finally when Evanescence played, the crowd got rowdy and that's when some 300 pound black guy socked me in the face. I also learned that you can't fight the fact that you're going to be touching a whole lot of people; and if you try to, you're just going to get hurt. Evanescence put on a really good concert, which kind of took me by surprise, but it turned out to be an incredible concert.

      The best part about surprising Lisa is, knowing her she doesn't even know that today is Friday. And something big is happening tonight. She's gonna love me forever. I can't wait.

      I want it to rain so bad right now. Nothing besides sitting around in my underwear drinking cola while watching a french artsy film would make me happier. If it would rain, I would go out dancing. I would grab the nearest boy and dance all night long in the rain.  Or we could drink expresso and take a walk along the boardwalk. I could tell you all my secrets, if you'd tell me all of yours. We could hold hands and sit on the edge and pretend that everything's all right. It would be alright if I were with you.

      Oh Internet, why have I been so girly lately? Why does he do this to me? Everytime I hear his name, or something that reminds me of him, I get the excited/anxious feeling in my stomache like I want to jump him, or something. I haven't seen him in so long; I'm almost forgetting what it's like to look at him. I wonder what's going to happen.  I went to Randi's yesterday, and we went to the mall. I bought a pair of aviator sunglasses (which surprisingly look alright), and we took a bunch of random photobooth pictures. I love those, so I've made a goal to do that with all of my closest friends.           16. Take goofy photobooth pictures with a friend   We eventually made our way back to Randi's where we made art projects and giggled about things, and played videogames well into the night. It was while we were gaming that I realized I need to play more, I'm losing my gamer's hands. Randi, I love you so much; don't you ever forget that. And make sure I never forget it either.

      Ever feel like you're stuck in a loop, and if you don't do something drastic you'll never get out? Or having such a selfish father that doing that something drastic seems pretty logical at this point? Maybe it's just me, but after having my Learner's license for a year and still not being able to confidently drive on my own, I feel like screaming. I can't stand feeling like I'm always second to what my father wants. A prime example would be today: yesterday I was promised a driving lesson, but tonight when my dad came home, he talked about him golfing after work. When I asked him if we could go driving, he mentioned having a migraine all day and now that he's home, he just wants to relax. I'd undestand him wanting to relax if he hadn't gone golfing; but it's just rediculous at this point. Not only do I feel like he's got no trust in me, but it's like he doesn't care at all about me.   It'd be so much easier if I could just confront him about it, but everytime I've tried to do so, it just ends up with him yelling at me, and me bawling. As calm and collected as I try to be, he just seems to blow it out of porportion. I wish I could make him see how he treats me sometimes. I don't even think my mom understands it fully, otherwise she would have had a hand in ages ago. Wouldn't it have been easier to get it over with last year? Wouldn't it be easier to just let me go out and be able to do my own thing? I hate being chauffered around all the time. I hate it so much. And asking for rides places all the time, it must get annoying.  This entry wasn't worth the time it took typing it out. I could have said, "My father's a fucking selfish asshole." It means the same thing anyhow. Somehow I think Fraser will be driving before I will. And he only got his learner's a couple months ago. We both agreed he won't be liable to get his Class 5 until he's like, forty. Fraser, where are you? Spending time with you is what usually gets me through the day; I need your company right now. You make me smile.
