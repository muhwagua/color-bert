       So I stayed up a little late last night, nothing to bad but the fact that I watched Elimidate for an hour disturbs me to no end.  I have to say that I know the show sucks and it uses the most superficial and mentally challenged  people but why is it so interesting?  In the episode that I saw you had this bartender girl talking about how she wants to find a  "mature and fun guy" .  What does she do, dresses like a skank and really has nothing smart to say to the guys she was out on the date with, example "If you were an animal, what animal would you be and why?"  PURE FUCKING GENIUS!!!!!!!    The next show is the same show but with 4 girls and 1 guy.  This was even worse then the men, the girls were openly fighting about him.  The one girl who was actually very smart was the second to get  "elimidated" , because she wouldn't let the guy kiss her belly button, wow first date, hello?.  The guy in this show was  a guy that owned his own dot com company and was so proud he was Greek. In the end the skankiest of skank bartenderettes won. So ends another mind blowing philosophical episode of elimidate.   I am mad at who ever came up with the concept of the show, either he/she is a smart person using this as a study in the declination of the human race or some schlocky producer who is just as trashy as the people on the show.  Dating, hmmmmmmm, trying to find that special someone to spend the rest of you life and possibly have kids but instead this program showcases the people who shouldn't be reproducing and peeing in the gene pool.        wow, enough of that for a good laugh check out  urlLink Something Awful  Photoshop Phriday, this weeks theme is WWII propoganda posters.  It also has come to my attention that people read this site, please  urlLink email  me and let me know what you think.

      Things I can't wait for:    Summer  The neew  urlLink Verbena  Album  Road trip(s) that are being planned for this summer  Swimming   Actually, I am just really pissed that the weather has been so shitty lately. I am getting mad at myself because I am thinking of all the fun summer stuff to do and I am getting so anxiuos for summer now that when I look outside it bums me out.   The  urlLink Rock N' Roll High School's  Message board is back up to normal and I've been having fun reading the  urlLink Disinformation Machine's  message board, quite a group they have attracted.  Give the RNRHS message board a weekend and it will be back to it's old self, a collection of scenesters battling for points and making outlandish comments/rants about their band compared to some other band.  You could use it as a study of the microcosom of the Green Bay scenester scene. Sadly though my person on the inside is telling me that everyone plans to move to Milwaukee eventually leaving Green Bay.

       My dad called me today to tell me someone I went to high school with died.  I remember the guy because we were on the same baseball team together and his dad was our coach for at least 2 summers straight.  I think it is because I am getting older; but lately at least once a month I hear of a person that I either met or was a friend of a friend that has passed away.  Is it because I am older? I realize that my life in the past year is just getting into full swing, I am getting set to spend the rest of my life with the one person that I care for and that cares for me and I don't want anything to happen to either of us.  I think right now death and money (taxes)  are my only obstacles in life that I have to look out for because for the past year everything has been perfect and I honestly can say things are only going to get better - Yes, I truly do believe in true happiness and the ultimate fullfilment of life.

      Ever since the house fire I haven't watched much TV, save for the week of  Direct  TV at my dad's house, but since then I have watched maybe 4 movies. That was over a month ago, what do I do with my time, I haven't read a book in that span and yet I don't remember what I have been doing. I started to paint again and take pictures, oh wait I remember, I have been going out to the bars lately, mostly to the  urlLink 29 Steps .  I need to not go out so much.

      The jesus man wasn't standing outside on the street corner wasn't there today, maybe he got a job.  I was kinda shocked but not really  too  shocked because it is Green Bay.  We don't have the quality of weirdos that larger cities do have. (see Chicago, New York, ect.)  This guy wasn't even weird looking, you could argue the use of the term weirdo, he wasn't physically messed up, maybe mentally but I never had a conversation with him.  He just gets the name weirdo because not many people stand around Green Bay street corners touting the saving powers of jesus.  I am not condeming(sp?) him but for this town what he was doing is just weird, in Chicago or New York, no problem, he would be crowded off the street by the other jesus barkers and touters.

      Yay!, our phone and DSL now work .  Jenny was telling me how odd it was to hear the phone ring and that she didn't know what to say when she picked up the phone to answer it.  I am going through the same but with microwave useage.  I couldn't figure out how to use the microwave at work, being the first time I used it, and I couldn't figure out why.   Joe and I decided that Blake Smith writes the catchiest, poppiest songs that have the some of the best hooks in the world, cheers to Fig Dish and  urlLink Caviar .  urlLink Poster Children  this weekend in Manitowoc, get pumped fuckers.  Maybe Illinois is good for something after all.....

      Hmmmm...mid week blues. Kinda bummed out for no apparent reason, wait I know why, for the first time it is above 50 degrees and sunny outside and I am in this windowless box for another 2.5 hours.   I hope it stays nice out tonight because I'd like to take some pictures outside tonight, maybe take some black and white tonight but I am worried about the they will develop at a 1 hour place, I was told they don't turn out as well maybe I'll just send the film in.  Maybe I'll do nothing and play Diablo II, maybe.....

      So.... Jenny said that I can take some of my tax return and use it to buy some clothes since I have four to five favorite shirts that I wear all the time.  I don't know where to look for new clothes if it took me three plus years to find five comfortable shirts.  This is why I don't like clothes shopping, I can never find anything I like, and when I do it is insanely expensive and then I just refuse to pay money for it.  I hope that this time shopping will be different because everytime Jenny has taken me shopping I did score at least one good article of clothing.

      Not having our DSL line, and our phone for that matter, hooked up really sucks, I have to wait for work to update this.  So its Monday, not really anything going on yet, started to do the taxes this weekend and realized that I need different forms so I have to finish them tonight. I am pretty boring today.

      The weather has been great but I haven't. Being sick on Friday didn't really help and lately I have been pretty bummed but I don't know why.  I have just re-discovered  urlLink YesterdayLand  and have been thinking alot about my youth and what growing up was like for me.  Jenny and I need to go on a good road trip soon, I need to prepare a good soundtrack for a road trip.

      Things You'd Love to Say at Work, but Can't:  1. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of crap.  2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.  3. How about never? Is never good for you?  4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.  5. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to see it my way.  6. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.  7. I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message.  8. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.  9. It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying.  10. Ahhhh ... I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again.  11. I like you. You remind me of myself when I was young and stupid.  12. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.  13. I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn.  14. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.  15. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.  16. Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view.  17. The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.  18. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?  19. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.  20. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.  21. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.  22. And your crybaby whiny-a$$ opinion would be ... ?  23. Do I look like a people person?  24. This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.  25. I started out with nothing and still have most of it left.  26. Sarcasm is just one more service we offer.  27. If I throw a stick, will you leave?  28. Errors have been made. Others will be blamed.  29. Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed.  30. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.  31. A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door.  32. Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1?  33. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.  34. Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it?  35. Chaos, panic & disorder, my work here is done.  36. How do I set a laser printer to stun?  37. I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted paychecks

      Do you know when you thought you were right but maybe thought that you might not be but then found out that you were really right and now things are so much bettter? yeah, well that times 1000000 is what I feel. People can be so petty and have many misconcieved notions, I think that  thinking  , I mean really thinking is something that people need to learn.

      So I found this website,  urlLink Roadside America  and I really getting into the stories and places they list on the site.  It kind of reminds me of the settings for Pee Wee and Hey Vern Movies, all bright colors with Rube Goldbergish inventions, and just plain weird people and places. I think this might be the ultimate roadtrip planner.

       Not since childhood....    ....did I feel the sense of pure little kid fun and happiness.  Last night I saw Spiderman, and ever since then I have been thinking of my childhood and were it has gone.  I remember all the TV shows I used to watch, mostly cartoons, and all the toys and all the time I used to spend playing with them, oblivious to time and what was going on around me.  Now if I want to do anything outside of everyday stuff that needs to be done, the first question I ask myself is, Do I have time to do this?  Now that I think about it that is kinda fucked up, seriously.  I like being an adult, Jenny really likes it when I show something I like to call "Resposibility Initiative". Let me give you an example - last week I folded and put away the clothes in the dryer.  No, I feel fine, thaks for asking.  There are two things that bother me about this,  I realize that I have to get my shit together in order to operate in the adult world and the other is that I don't see were you get to figure in fun into the equation.       The more I think about it, what I thought was fun when I was little kinda sucks now in comparison to what I find enjoyable and fun now, why?      Do you remember these shows????????     Galaxy Rangers  Bionic Six  Silver Hawks  Centurions

       So much to do, so little time   My sister is going to start school at UWGB next fall and she is going to study to be a cancer researcher. I think thats a pretty noble thing to do with your life.  Then Jenny made the comment that I am such a smart person but I lack the ambition to actually go to school and do something.  I don't have a problem with that statement but she is also right.  It isn't that I don't want to go to school, I just don't know what I would like to study.  I would love to study any number of the sciences, but that involves math and I really hate math.  I need to figure out what I need/want to do with my intelectual life right now.

       The story so far:         My hand still tingles from the morning wakeup and work is going really slow.  An upside to work has occured, I received three  pre-pasted  toothbrushes, made in china, kinda makes me afraid of them.        Yeah, so today, for some reason I have this impending urge to start a band again - for fun or for real, I really don't know. I do know that I have songs ready for this endevour I jus need to find people that are into the Rolling Stones, Nirvana, and Fig Dish - hah - good luck. The Clean Jerks need to make an appearance soon, maybe that is all I need. No,  I need to get in touch with Eric to get this sitiuated, maybe a couple night shows at IQ's or maybe I can milk a milwaukee show out of him, there has to be a place for the jerks to play in millwaukee.    urlLink The Clean Jerks  - There are a few other sites, like Iuma that have more songs so check those out too.

I have been reading the message board at the book's website which is at  urlLink Houseofleaves.com   I also found an online type of story/mystrery/horror archive/story/database and I haven't been able to really get into it but I think it might be worth a look anyway.

       Problem Kids   Seriously, was I so bad when I was a child, was anyone as maladjusted as kids are now? Shit, I'm taliking like my dad. I can't comprehend being twelve years old and being a chronic runnaway.    I've been camping, sun-burning, and being very busy for some reason.  I left  urlLink echo7  so I could have more time for myself and Jenny and it seems that I have more places to be and things to do than I ever did before.  I just wanted to relax and here I am spending all this time not at home and not playing my Xbox.   Jenny and I had our "marriage encounter weekend" which should be retitled "do you talk to your partner at all, because if you don't why do you want to get married in the fist place?" Jenny and I did not have a good time and were very turned off by what they had to say, if you don't understand your partner, why are you getting married in the first place? Jenny and I have discussed the matters they brought to us way more in depth than they had us discuss them in a one on one setting.  I really believe that because Jenny is the Most Wonderful Woman in the Universe, or M.W.W.U., is how we came to understand the human relation dynamic all on our own.

       Too late...    So I'm thinking, hey I should start a band, and it should have keyboards and stuff.  Then I start cheking out a few online zines and start reading interviews with bands and I soon find out they all include keyboards.  Idea shot down.   I do want to start a band, because just like all of my previous relationships, I couldn't be myself in echo7.  I  was  very  uncomfortable being myself in a band setting interacting with other bands, the only remedy to this was alcohol.   I need to be comfortable, maybe a band that includes just me is what I need.   p.s. Enon is playing Ryans Ballroom on August 21st be there.

Onliners    I was trying to see if people on BBS's tend to be hateful and clique-ish to "outsiders" that invade their space on the internet,  I guess I was right. I guess humans tend to be as territorial as animals and attack, obviously not physically, but witht the wonderful minds that were given to us.  I won't say by whom because that would be a whole other short essay.    Group Dynamic    It didn't take long to piss people off, make an off comment about someone's sexual orientation(i.e. call them a fag) and people get pretty pissed.  Usually people who tend to populate BBS's tend to be more of the cereberal type in that they like to share ideas, talk about the news, or talk about the common bond that they all share, beit a  hobby, music, or a profession.   What I also found to be interesting in my most recent experience is that the people are more animalistic because the work in groups(being a pair or more) just like hunting, they wait for someone to expose that jugualr and then strike.    Skewed Data  Maybe the three choices of message boards that I used were not as good of a sampling that I could have chosen. My apologies to people I've pissed off, If I told you what I was doing, you wouldn't have given me the natural reaction that I needed.    My Conclusion  People hunt and roam their online communities in packs, forming alliances, backstabbing, ect. every day.  Some people even exist in a truer sense of themselves oline, not holding back and the limited anonymity that the internet provides these people, they open up repressed feeling/thoughts and project it onto their internet persona.  I believe that it is usually with very introverted people as they tend to not have the communication skills, written and verbal, they need to get their point across.  This then shows true to the reversion to the animal instinct.    I'm not a scientist but I play one on the TV in my mind

       The weight of a thousand pounds has been lifted    I hope that you all can understand when I say that.   I did something I needed to do last night for a long time.  I told someone how I felt, for all the right reasons.  This is probably the second or third in my life that I had never questioned my actions, with out a doubt I knew I was right with what I said and done.

       Lose this crowd  So,  it was a good friends birthday last night and we went to dinner and we were going out for some drinks and such.  Little did I know that we were going to the "country" bar in town called  Denim and Diamonds .  Funny place, even more funny the faster you consume vodka gimlets.   Anyway, the point of my story is that the bar we went to is actually three bars connected together and you can go from bar to bar.  The country bar is connected to a 50'-60's bar and there was a cover band playing.  I've never seen the band but the guitar store I go to all the time is run by two or three of the guys in the band.   It dawned on me at that point, cover bands have to be at least fun to play in.  Seriously I am so dis-illusioned with trying to write new songs that all of my newest stuff sounds so regular.  Echo7's big thing was try to be different, Green Bay isn't the place for that.   The metal "scene" is way better than the punk/rock/indie "scene" just because there are more people around that dig metal.   Being a fan of both I found it hard to do shows in Green Bay.  I loved playing with heavy bands like Mr. Slate, Disinformation Machine, and Sounds Like Braille(not that heavy but very King Crimson).  I really liked the music but when we would get on stage, it just wasn't heavy enought to compete with the sheer sonic madness. I don't even want to start on the punk/rock/indie part of Green Bay, let me put it this way, I tend to think of them and a very large disfunctional family - extremely cliqueish and will backstab(some times) in an instant.  Ego's are great but when they make you an asshole, you need to stop, unless you are in Oasis and your last name is Gallagher.

       No fun.        So as my life is at an all time high point only to climb even high to that apex of human/emotional I still find myself loathing half of my new co-workers. We hava a new mechanic. I thought every company had an ass-kisser but this dude is ass-kisser-extreme.  That guy and the IT dude that talks to you like a fucking baby because you can't understand his high level of computer knowledge.  I think he's just pissed cause he isn't nailing the gay guy from accounting.   I have some new pictures scanned, I don't know when I will get them up, I have to play Xbox before I'll even get close to thinking about that.

       Road to war?    I don't tend to wax and wain politically but doesn't whats going on with Iraq at least bother you?  To tell you the truth, it kind scares me.  So we don't have the support of the UN behind us, does that mean we should back down?  What if Sadam is really a threat and a couple of months down the road he does try to use chemical, biological, or even nuclear warfare on us, Israel or anyone else.  On the other hand he may not be a threat and this is all just politics as usual, i.e. bullshit posturing to bring a illusion of strength and decency to the U.S.  The fact that the German Chancel or has rebuked us for wanting to take out Sadam should be some sort of sign that if we do enter a war with Iraq we will not have the support that we had the first time around.     Vietnam seemed like a good idea at first but look what it did to our nation and our trust in our government.   We need Ms. Cleo to tell us the future.  Hell, I'd pay $5.99 a minute to see what we should and shouldn't do    Your part  Do you support our leaders, granted politicians tend to be greedy back stabbers(a prerequisite I do believe) but would you support them and their decisions for  our  country???  Did you vote yesterday?  State party lines seem to be so unaffectual to some people but just exercising your right to vote is something that I will never ever forget to do.  I feel you can't complain about government/taxes/well fare ect. unless you voted because to me that just makes it seem moot when people bitch about something they could've had a say in.

       We make our plans and then we attack    What a weird week.    The more I read websites like the eKo, actionman, and others of the online music mag ilk, I get so bummed out about being in bands and making music.  I can't get into half of the "local"(wisconsin) bands because either it is crappy nu-metal or the people in the band are complete cock strokers who can't shut-up about your band.  When I was in  urlLink Echo7  and people would ask me about the band and all that band shit you're supposed to do and I just didn't get into like other people did.  I liked playing in front of people in different citite/towns/townships but thats it, name dropping bands sucked and still do.  What I don't get is what are these people going to do in 4 years when they realize that they aren't making money, they're getting old(like 30), and just really don't have anything to show for what they did and now are worried about not having health insurance and/or somesort of retirment and realize they will be working till the day they die.  For some people it isn't a problem to balance work and music.  If you don't have a huge social circle this is workable, when you have a larger social circle and need that social interaction, you're going to fail in the music deptartment. WOW I am just not in the writing mood, these sentances suck.  No matter how I look at I am making music for myself but I also feel the need to have someone say, "hey, that's pretty good.".  Oh I can't win them all.    Now that we have all of the wedding planning done and have T-minus 8 days to go it just seems like we forgot something.   cool/fun stuff  our wedding  Going to Cabo San Lucas  Cameras  water colors  kittens and rainbows(for John C.)

       You'll be OK     Working on a Saturday morning really bores me.  There is nothing to do.  I still need one complete whole day at home with Jenny so that I can recover from this jet-lag induced travel sickness that still has me fatiqued and annoyed with my insides.  I need the time away from people here at work too before I committ a felony and off a fellow employee.   Still, it is great to be home and don't let anyone fool you, sure Mexico is fun if you like to drink and party but I find the country dirty and repulsive.  I mean, it isn't the people of mexico's fault , they just don't have any real good natural resources to exploit like we do in the states. Besides, I cannot hold them responsible for their situation, I am sure it has to do with the strong arming of the other world super powers that picked them to be on the team last insuring their economic downfall.

       *    Whenever I am at my bar drinking and someone has to bring up a conversation about life and philosophy I should set my beer down and walk out of the door.  I like conversing on life and other topics of the ilk, but if the person just can't support claims and asks a bunch of "what if" questions without having a basis for their own "life philosophy". I digress, why can't the holidays just be over?  I am not even feeling the holiday crunch but I fear of its coming.  I am excited about this Christmas but I wish I could just avoid the whole "holiday madness"

       A Monday that Rules!       I am having what could be one of the best Mondays ever in the history of my life.  I am not tired and I awoke to a warm car, lunch made, and coffee ready.  Jenny is the the most wonderful woman in the universe or MWWU and for that, I am thankful.  Work is happy-busy and not to demanding, if all of my students tonight have practiced that would make my day even better, but I know that won't happen.  So aside from the guitar lessons I have to teach tonight my day will go down in history.

       Niner!     So I recieved the reel-to-reel tape recorder today from my co-worker and I am just pumped to get to mess with it later tonight. I really hope it works out so that I can use it as a silmutaneous 4-trac instead of the 2 channel mono recording that my Fostex 4-trac does. It should reproduce great and it will have the lo-fi rock sound to go with it.   We get to spend the weekend at Jenny's parents house to hang out with her sister who is having her tonsils removed as I type this.  It will be nice to catch some weekend cable programming and relax in a wood heat home.  I miss having wood heat, there is something about it that makes it so much better than non-wood heat sources.  It warms your insides as well as outsides.

       I look like a what?         Yes Jenny, this one  is  about you.  I am in not any way offended by this but Jenny said to me, not seconds after entering out apartment, that I look like a hampster.  I love that woman!  A guy that I work with is going to give me his old 4-trac reel-to-reel recorder, how awsome is that?!?!?!?!?!  I never really intended on joining a band again but here I am playing again in a band.  This time around it is totally what I want to be doing music wise. I loved  urlLink echo7  but after a while alot of things didn't happen and the music was changing to something that didn't suite my tastes.  The cool thing about this band is that we practice two blocks from my place and we will be practicing 2-3 times a week.  It felt odd at first because after leaving echo7 it really felt like I wasn't going to be in another band ever, sans the ever on hiatus  urlLink Clean Jerks .  After a few "practices" I realized that this is really something that is a big part of me so I didn't need to justify it.  Now that I got that out of the way I can focus more on songs. I already wrote 3 songs and we have them done already in only 3 practices and I have more on the way, I just need to arrange them and string them together. Jenny had a big part in this too, she pushed me(sorta) to do this. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love that woman!

       Happy Monday    Today at work in our daily email it said. "Martin Luther King day - No mail delivery."      It struck me as odd,  when do we just think of today as a "no mail day" and not what Dr. King stood for? I find it even more odd here where I work when that 80% of our work force is Hispanic or Hmong.  I really can't express myself on this matter, all I know is that even though people have great intentions, many don't act on those ideas.  So when has it just become just another no-mail day and not Martin Luther King day?

       X-Men      For some reason I was thinking about a particular head wound I received while at CCD around 5th grade.  It is not that I have a list of head wounds I received, it just strikes me as odd that I just remember it and I do recall that if fucking hurt alot.  We were in the basement of the old school house that is next to the church that I went to when I was living in the shrinking ghost town of Krakow Wisconsin.  We were doing things that boys in fifth grade did back then like looking for bugs, talking about WWF wrestling, and which Stars Wars character you would rather be.(we had this conversation weekly) So here we are, hanging out in a basement of an old building filled with pillars when sombody mentions my name. I don't recall what I was doing at the time but I spun around and whacked my temple into the steel pole.  I woke up on the ground and all the guys where just looking at me and a few other kids showed up to see me. I didn't have any gaping wounds but I really couldn't stand.  I spent the rest of the morning dazed and probably drooling, I don' t recall.  I never went to see a doctor but I am sure that I had a massive concusion.    Getting back to why I was thinking about that particular cartoonless Saturday morning.  I was thinking about what is killing people, cancer and disease are such a wonderful topic of thought, and I was wondering what if it is the mundane things that happen and not the carcengins and pollution that is killing us. I imediately thought of that day and how if I ever got a brain tumor it would be in the sign of an upside down crucifix.  Nothing cool could ever come out of that concusion - like latent psychic abilities surfacing so I could start a group of crime fighters or a school for mutants. I'd have to shave my head though.

       The Terror of Tiny Town     Yesterday I visited my grandmother because her brother and sister were in town.  Normally that isn't my thing and I wouldn't think twice abou it.  After my mom called and told me that I decided that I should go, they were old, but I bet that it would be a good time.  When I arrived they had baked chicken and some sort of saurkraut/egg noodle/chicken/misc. caserole that rocked.  I also had a piece of chocolate cake, the last piece and Jenny called me selfish because I didn't bring it home for her, the cake that is.  My grandma's siblings are all older so when they talk about their kids turning 60ish and so and so is retiring from their job it is kinda weird because my mom isn't even 50, but these are  old  people talking about  older-younger  people.  My mom's uncle Tony made a good point out of the conversation, "You know Josh. one day you will be having this same type of conversation yourself".  I am only 25, by no means do I feel old, but that made me feel like time was fleeting away I better do all the fun stuff before I need to get myself a walker or a cane.  Old people get tired at 7:30pm(because they are up at 4am) so at 8 I was out of there.  I had a good time, took a picture of the "kids" and was out the door headed back home.  Jenny, Mitch, and I went to 29 Steps where I proceeded to get drunk and make fun of this  urlLink movie , that Paul bought for 2.99 at Take Two.  Jenny said I was mean and made the statement, "What if one our kids turn out to be a midget?".   He/she is going to learn how to ride a horse and sing.

       Out of Step.     I've said it before, in casual conversations and with friends.  I feel like a jaded rocker.  The "scene" is played out, moved to be played out again by the players of old, to be recycled again into something new and  exciting .    That seems to be a topic dear to me when I think about playing in a band. Did I miss something? I don't find today's music appealing. It could have been that point in my early teen years when I went from being interested in more indie labels/bands than current top 40. Ask me to remember a top 40 hit from 91-96, I couldn't remember one for the life of me. This past fall my wife and I were at a show in Shawano and I had made the comment that "I forgot my eye make-up and spiked collar at home".   I am by no means getting old, it just seems that I let go of certain aspects of things.  Making music is awsome, long ago I was concerned and frustrated with "the scene" and now I could care less.  It is funny how uncomfortable people get and must clutch onto what they know and love and can't let it go to so that they can create a new sound that becomes this new random fascinating product that could be the true representation of what they wanted to say.  Part of that is the mind-washed "punk" youth of today.  I was never punk, never claimed to be nor do I know or really care what it stands for.  For many people it means thousands or different ideas and feelings.  Some other people view it as a "look", somehow to fit in.  That is when you get sucked in, never to return back from that road of force-fed music.   The world will be a better place as soon as people seperate the fashion of music from the art of music.

       Disco-Nected    Weird medicine effects today. Contact severe cold and flu is making me all weird and emo, instead of my normal  happy to bitch at you at work because you are an idiot who dosen't ask questions untill you fuck something up, which could've been avoided had you asked in the first place , but that is just at work.  Why do I love my job so? It is all about the people and the mind-numbing experiences that they produce, some people are either fucking annoying or fucking weird.  I thought I was weird, I guess not.

       Bigger, Better, LOUDER    So with the  urlLink NaturalTwenty  CD being redone by Chris's friend Chay(sp?), I was thinking to myself, "How can I make this special?"(actually, "how can I charge more for our CD?")  The fact that it is being re-mastered/mixed out of the goodnes of some soul's heart means that it will have to be presented in much more classier way than the current.  I am going to make hand-made CD packaging. The cost will be at least 10$+ each.  It may seem alot for 8 songs but each one is going to be hand made. This is all dependant on how the re-mastering/mixing goes and how soon I get it.

The program interviews a bunch of people so that they get a good range of people, ethics, and perverts.  I had more to write but I don't feel like it now.

       Time isn't on my side     Where has all of the time gone? Four weeks-four weddings, visitors from out of town and a pontoon trip.  I love spending time with my friends but when is this going to slow down?   Lots of exciting things happening - like I said people getting married, people having babies, and still losing softball games.  Fred, I haven't emailed you because I have been so busy and I just can't top your hail story so untill I get pelted with something equally as great as hail or better, I'll let you know. Jon in Prague, I love your stories keep'em coming and good luck.(I still order gimlets as a Jon Cambell). Playing guitar in my old band again, Derek is back in it too. If we could convince Scott to come up from Milwaukee and play drums we could tell everyone we are on a mission from God.

       Why I love my job    I think it is the people that I get to work with.    Hi Josh - There's a barrle of XXX oil that has to be sent back. XXX X. said it's not what he want's. I talk to XXXX the rep from XXX and he said it whould be ok to send it back.  There will be and order for a diffante kind of oil comeing to replace it with.   P.S. the barrle is right outside the door receiveing door.    Something else that I love about my job is that it allows me to spend time listening to new bands.  I started to download some songs of bands that I've heard of but never got around to buying the CD because I don't have any money.  I've fallen in to the trap known as Pavement.  I truly love this band and I wonder why I wasn't listening to this band.  Slanted and Enchanted, blows my mind! This band should have been way more important than Nirvana.  I like finding older CD's from bands that blow away newer bands, its refreshing and keeps me from thinking about the old saying "everything has been done before".  Last week it was Ted Leo, now its Pavement, I can't wait for next week.   P.S. I hope everyone has a happy Friday.

       Fridays    Nothing like coming down off of a RNR high.  Last night we kicked ass for the few that were left at 11:30 at Ryan's Ballroom. Fuck yeah. The new Echo7 songs are so rock and I think are the best that jOe has written to date.

       Music seems crazy, bands start up    Usage Note: The words ironic, irony, and ironically are sometimes used of events and circumstances that might better be described as simply coincidental or improbable, in that they suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly. Thus 78 percent of the Usage Panel rejects the use of ironically in the sentence: In 1969 Susie moved from Ithaca to California where she met her husband-to-be, who, ironically, also came from upstate New York. Some Panelists noted that this particular usage might be acceptable if Susie had in fact moved to California in order to find a husband, in which case the story could be taken as exemplifying the folly of supposing that we can know what fate has in store for us. By contrast, 73 percent accepted the sentence Ironically, even as the government was fulminating against American policy, American jeans and videocassettes were the hottest items in the stalls of the market, where the incongruity can be seen as an example of human inconsistency.

       Head butt!!  Jeff, Matt, I'm sorry guys....   urlLink From: http://www.alternativetentacles.com/news.php?sd=Jdmidc@jSfHUKURbVgg   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: R.I.P. WESLEY WILLIS  Dear Friends and fellow Wesleynauts,  We are deeply saddened to report that one of our artists, Wesley Willis passed away yesterday, Thursday, August 21st. Wesley will be greatly missed by all that had the privilege to know him, as well as the fans who have been fortunate enough to experience his genius.  Wesley was diagnosed with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) at the end of 2002, and had to undergo emergency surgery on June 2nd to identify the source of, and to suppress internal bleeding. It is not clear if this bleeding was related to his leukemia or not, and the exact cause of death is still unknown. Wesley had been recovering at a Hospice in Illinois, and since the surgery his health had declined.  His songs were simultaneously disturbing, hilarious, blunt, and intoxicating. Wesley's sheer excitement and unaffected honesty about every cultural phenomenon defined his music as truly individual, and truly punk rock. Wesley released well over 50 albums--three of which are on Alternative Tentacles, and a fourth, entitled "Wesley Willis Greatest Hits, Vol. 3" (Enhanced CD) had already been scheduled for release in October of this year.  For more information on Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, please visit http://leukemia-lymphoma.org.    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: WESLEY WILLIS 1963-2003  A letter from one of his biggest fans, Jello Biafra:  We lost Wesley Willis some time before 9PM Chicago time August 21, 2003. Word is he died peacefully. The likely cause may be heart failure. Wes had been battling leukemia for less than a year.  No services are planned as of yet. There will probably be a memorial concert, or at least a gathering in his honor in Chicago in the near future. We will let you know.  Wesley will go down as one of the most unique songwriters and entertainment personalities in history. His music, lyrics, drawings, insight and the way he put them together are like no one else. Ever. There will never be another.  As I got to know Wes, what really struck me was his sheer will power, his unrelenting drive to succeed and over come his horrifically poor background, child abuse, racism, chronic schizophrenia and obesity among other things. He was the most courageous person I have ever known.  Yet through it all he had such a deep, all-encompassing love of life. Little things, big things. He loved bus rides. He loved watching trains. He loved writing songs about how much he loved his friends. He loved travelling to new towns so he could headbutt new friends. Is there any band he saw that escaped being in their own song about how much he loved their show? He was so warm, so sweet, so giving. He could be a handful when he came to visit; but as soon as he left, we'd miss him immediately.  As his long time friend Dennis Cooper said, "No More Demons." The voices in Wesley's head can't yell at him and put him down any more.  Wes was deeply religious. He was afraid that if he died he would no longer get to go see bands play. If there is a hereafter I hope he's right up front as Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn, his beloved Otis Redding and his dear friend Bradley from Sublime "storm the stage" as the crowd "roars like a sea monster." All opening for Wesley, of course.  It will be hard now that he's gone, but I'm not going to let myself stop enjoying the funny stuff, or the look on people's faces when they first hear "Rock n Roll McDonalds," or the memories of the good times and Wesley's many adventures. He wouldn't want it any other way.  There are many down times when all I have to do is think of one of Wes's songs, something he said or simply marvel at his Wesley-isms, and the clouds part and a smile comes to my face. I think he does that for a lot of people. He always will.  Rock over London Rock on Chicago Sail on, Wes. I love you.  Jello Biafra 8-22-03

       That's a pretty nice hair cut    Hofa Park - Mosquito city, Doug and I were drinking beer and smoking cigs when I was bit on the fore-head. It looked like I passed out and hit my head on the toilet or sink for about 30 minutes, then it just proceeded to itch like fuck and bug the hell out of me. That is what I get for "hanging" in Hofa Park.  I'm glad everyone came inside when we finished our set, to quote jOe "Let the metal begin!!" the Godsmack comment was equally gratifying because I don't believe some of the people in attendance take  themselves seriously.  I felt out of place without my eyeliner and spikes.   Main Stage - There is a picture of us  urlLink standing around , which was probably more exciting than the show itself.   The Brunswicks  played with us and they have claimed the current title of  Favorite Local Band , they are super mellow and Nathan has a fucking nice guitar too. They don't have a website, do not hesitate to see this band, they are great and my wife digs the sounds, so guys;chicks dig them too.  Our part of the show was good, we did our non-usual meltdowny noise holy fuck that's loud fest and it seemed to go over well.  After the show we went to 29 Steps, I feeling a little dejected enjoyed some alcohol untill the lights came on and the ubiquitous hour of bar close had arrived.  A slow walk across the street and to our home we were, ready for sleep.   Manitowoc(Manty) - I didn't know how well this show was going to go.  It seems our new drummer is not only a teacher but somewhat of a celebrity in the town.  This was probably our best all-ages show in a long time.  We were received very well, not only that we played very well too. Not too long and not too short and sold all or most of our CDs.  The bands that played that night too were great, "from germany"(I think) were total Sounds Like Braille rock goodness. Honestly it has been along time since I came home at midnight and was really excited about all the bands that played that night.  It was nice to not have a metal band/hardcore/screamcore/whatevercore in the house.  Manty has a good thing going and I had a blast.  Tonight I avoided stupide(that's French you ass)  testing at school, I was already enrolled in a program there in the past and now they want me to take a some skills testing crap. Its bad enough I have to sit next to the stupid kid in my tuesday class that has a conflict with breathing properly and not drooling that they want me to go and be "tested". It's NWTC, and I'm not tootin my horn here but I am too smart for my classes and either I'll blow it cause its boring or I'll get and A, because then work pays for it and Jenny won't kick my ass because she know's I'm smart.   It was great to see everyone this weekend, everyone who didn't get to go to Capone's in Manty with us(Abe, Gash, and Bob) needs to hook up with Joe and I again so we can go and enjoy some fine eats.  Even though its Monday and it is cloudy and boring out I am having a wonderfully sedated-mind-blowingly-productive-calm day. Holy fucking Zen moment, you'd think I could levitate or crush your heart with the hand in my mind.  Fred, I'm thinking about you, beacause that shit is right up your alley.

       I gonna hunt you down, no matter wher you run!!!!      Today is good, great, awsome, take your pick.  I don't know why but the combination of sun and non-heat are a great thing.  So John is on the move again in Europe, I was wondering how long it was going to take him to get up and see more. I could see him ending up in Nepal or India.  Overkilling this  urlLink Bloodshot Records  sampler and it still isn't getting old. It is forcing me to possibly buying a cd or nine.  It is also forcing me to re-evalute my stance on bluegrass, not just for whittlin' anymore.   urlLink Sundance Channel  is running a four week documentary show hosted by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth fame about indie music and the evolment of indie music with indie film. Seems cool enough, they are even going to show Spoon videos as well as other not-so-well-known bands and their videos.  So I spent a good part of the day reading  urlLink abe's  site and I've concluded that if this were a photoblog there would be a ton o'pictures of my cats and Jenny up on this page. Check out his site, there is even a picture of Jenny and I on there somewhere. In the picture I was having a bad hair day. Normaly I don't care about shit like that but the hair is BAD!!!!!

       no title    I was driving to work today on my usual route and notice all this hub-bub at the courthouse.  At first I thought there was a fire because of all the fire trucks but then I saw a dude with a bagpipe and I just assumed it was some celebration.  Yeah, so I get to work and turn on my MSN messenger(mookiller@hotmail.com) and the MSN today widow pops up and instead of the celebrity gossip and which cell phone is best for your stories I see a "remember 9/11". It has been two years now and this turning point in American history that I have forgotten? It just kills me when people get all gung-ho American and wave the flag when two years ago they could've given a fuck.  I still don't get it, yeah our elected officials and governmental body pissed people off and killed/starved/screwed/fucked a lot of people in other countries as well as our own but OHMYGOD I FUCKINGLOVE AMERICA HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO(with 2X4 over shoulder). Seriously, what did I miss - did we apologize for being assholes and then our planes flew into our buildings? That would be inconsiderate of the terrorists because we apologized so don't fuck us.

       2 Time   Last night, what a show, I saw a ton of people I didn't know that were out for the show and they were having a good time as we played.  Jenny made a comment about our new drummer, Jesse was a great drummer and a good guy but Doug seems to *fit* us better.  She says that he plays harder and after tonight I think I'd have to agree.  This morning is a blur, did some work related running around and now I sit at work kicking myself for not bringing in my homework to take up the time.  Its nice and cool outside and fall is on its way and I for one can't wait.  The best thing about fall is all of the childhood and teenage years memories that get awakened with each passing scene from the car window.  You see a color or a combination of colors mixed with a mood and you have instant flashback.  Speaker Pimps Becoming X, after I blew the dust off of it, has become one of my new favorite albums to listen to.  The new Rapture is good too, I went through a dance/techno/trance phase with my music(Damn you Wipeout XL) and it seems to have come back full circle.  It seems to go like this Classic Rock to Indie Rockish types to hip hop(not rap) to alt country/bluegrass/rockabilly to techno, all in a matter of months.

       Public TV rules, for now...   I don't know where I saw  urlLink this  but I am super pumped about it. I am going to record it this time so I don't have be bummed when I see it in the store for 200$ ala the Ken Burns Jazz series.    urlLink PBS  is going to be showing a concert tonight at 9PM with Sonic Youth and Wilco.  I've heard one Wilco song and I dig the Sonic Youth so you can bet  I'll be watching this show tonight.  There is another  urlLink show  on Ella Fitzgerald on Sunday night too.  This is a pretty good round up considering we don't have cable and there this quality programming to watch.  Fall is on its way and with fall I find myself playing way more cds by the Melvins, Nirvana, Skeleton Key, and Verbena.  Nice soothing fall music, mostly what I listened to in high school falls(sans Skeleton Key) of outdoors trek's through the woods behind Nicole's house with the gang,  or our version of a stoned mission impossible in the ever lovely Green Valley.  Drinking the "Beast" at the party house in Green Valley, watching either the GI Joe movie or Transformers the Movie on the big big big screen with surround and being mesmerized.  I have to add Interpol to that list of fall music.  I like the colors of fall, even though depressing at times make for a happy Josh.  I wonder where they are, lost track, swallowed by time, slipped away.....  Adam James Dan(I see him sometimes) Jill Nicole Chuck  The house is remodeled, missing that older house charm completely.  Fall days that turned into winter nights of movies, drinking, and various other activities all lost with the restructuring/remodeling of the house.  I have to write down as many as I can remember before I lose them too.

       seek and destroy   This  urlLink program  does a nice job of removing any spyware on your computer that smuggled its way on board through the various add-on software that is downloaded from the internet.

       bah   NWTC is funny, the computer lab has many people in it all avoiding their prospective work assignments, like me by playing games(Jenny likes  urlLink pogo.com ) and other people doing god knows what and laughing to themselves maniacally. I was thinking of trying out a beta of a game that I "found" on one of the computers but it crashed the computer itself so I had to leave it and find a new working computer. I have the touch of death when it comes to any computer that isn't mine.

       Blind   Busy weekend.  Aaron was in town from San Jose for a wedding and met up with him at 29 steps on Friday for a hour or so.  Kevin was there too and it was a suprise to see him, at least he still plays drums.  I knew Aaron lived in California, I just didn't know where so when Jenny and I are going to be in California we are going to try and meet up with him and his wife, maybe dinner but most likely drinking.  The rest of the weekend was good, lots of lounging around and going out with Jenny's friend and watching them get drunk and bum shots off of guys ala Beth.  I found that the new Taco Burito Mexico restaraunt has better tacos than the other, must try the burrito.  Reading Abe's funnelnut blog, he's in Ireland now with Craiger and Timmy, galavanting as they go.    What's with this nickname stuff. Is it part of a group culture that appears over time to show that everyone in the group is OK with the other person?  Mostly the males in the circle of friends pick the names but male and female alike use the name to refer to said person(s).

       silver queen   Most of my memories are so old feeling to me, it is weird because some of them aren't even that long ago.   I think about middle school, high school, my first public appearance in  a "rock" band, the factory, fortress, meeting Fred for the first time, watching Bob hide a shovel in a tree, ect.   It all seems so long ago and yet it isn't all that old to time.  Fall is killing me with all of these memories.  They are all good memories, nostalgia really, that take me back.  Every once and a while a questionable moment arises and I wonder if I should have made different choices and then I realize I wouldn't be where I am now.

       SNOW!    Its snowing out, and if there is a lot of accumulation we are going to do some sledding, Bob wants to anyway.  Leaving for California tommorow morning, no work for 7 days. It has been a long time since that has happened, almost a year. I'll have pictures when I get back, or maybe while I'm there, depends on how motivated I get.  Fred is a serpent hunter extreme.

       you can never quarantine the past   California, or should I say  Califonia , was what I expected, a bunch of people with their worlds revolving around them not letting you in to there little morning space that keeps them satisfied until they get to the cubicle and reality crashes in and the Starbucks kicks their asses.  It ain't for me, thank god that Jenny didn't want to stay or move.  I've been to California before, I was a whipper-snapper then so I don't really remember much, just Judas Priest jean jacket patches and chinatown.    The wedding was different, it was at Stanford in the "memorial church" whatever, it was pretty but too nice for the sake of being nice and having weddings there.  The reception was decent, definately not a Wisconsin wedding. Free strong drinks, beer, and wine did help me aclimate to the situation.  The rest of the trip was nice, I wish I knew of some quiet places that Jenny and I could've gone to visit. Los Gatos was the highlight of the trip, mountain/hill trails and some nice scenery.  Fred sent me KOTOR in the mail and it was a welcome get home and spend the rest of vacation sneaking in as much time as possible.  Pictures of dead rattlesnake and crime scenes will be posted soon via Fred via the United States Postal Service.  I'm assuming that Abe had fun last  urlLink weekend .  Timmy too for that matter, I assume his tolerance dropped since they left Ireland.

       swiss cheese   It seems to be that I am not allowed to remember Derek's phone number unless I bring my phone with me to work.  Which in itself is dumb because I sit by a phone all day.  The nice not-so-hot weather is gone and is being slowly replaced by the cold-rainy-not-so-warm weather.  I prefer the gloom of fall, which I don't get because I am not a goth nor do I own any leather clothing and spikes.  This is totally weird and cool at the same time. I was looking at  urlLink Abe's  blog about the monkey arm thing while  the Rolling Stones's  Monkey Man  was playing and it was weird and I got all  urlLink Monkied (sp?) out.

       rust in the rain   Wonderful weekend, went out Friday and cosumed beer, met friends and had fun.  Saturday was awesome too, still lovin' the KOTOR(Thanks again Freddy!) and had a dinner with friends and family and then continued to consume more beer while watching the Badgers defeat the Buckeyes at 29 steps. Good times were had by all.

       alien commander/dude I'm a dork    So I watched half  urlLink Willow  this weekend and it made me think about a lot of stuff.  Mostly about the movies that I choose to watch and that recently I haven't viewed a good sci-fi flick in a long time.  Not counting sci-fi/horror, I want to see a strictly sf movie.  There is a list of shows that I am missing:    Dr. Who  Galaxy Rangers(now on DVD)  Robotech(still watching 3rd series/season/whatever)  Farscape     I think now that winter is almost upon us I'll get to watch more movies  As I was looking for the Willow page on the IMDB I was shocked to learn that there are two movies that involve leprechauns and being "in the hood". The perfect Halloween party duo.  Real ultra deja-vu right now, whoa.

       Movie   I was thinking about money and the problems surrounding it.  The problem is that we don't have any and it would be nice to have enough to buy a house. At least then we would have some sort of asset to obtain more money.  What would I do with this money you ask?  Move Fred into my basement and make a movie. Not that kind of movie mind you but a movie about life or kung fu.  A lot of my friends have the necessary skills.  Abe did some television/movie stuff in point and knows camera basics and the like.   Amanda would be a good cinematographer because she has the 35mm eye.  Fred would write the screenplays/plot lines/scripts/ect.  Jenny would do all of the PR. Tim would be our computer geek and extra with big ears.  Eric Paul $. would be legal representation.  Bob would be the gaffer/electrician.  Joe would compose the soundtrack for the movie.  John C. would be the director and consultant because he is the only person I know that went to actual film school.  Derek would be the set maker/designer/painter/prop person.  Chris would do the sound and recording of the soundtrack. Matt can be the historical reference/researcher.

       All right!   Really, really, really good band practice last night.  For the first time the songs flowed for me and I didn't have to force/coax anything from the guitar, it just spewed forth.  Shows lined up on December 19th and 20th in Shawano and Manitowoc, respectively.

       Silence Kit   Recieved a phone call from James today at work.  It was good to hear from him today, I don't get phone calls from Jenny because of the new job she took so it is nice to hear from somebody outside of the work place people I deal with everyday.  It makes my day, especially now with the rain and snow outside.  I wish I would've maybe dressed up for Halloween but I wouldn't know who or what to go as.

      No title today for how I feel.  Today was/is sort of a reflection day for me.  All I've done so far in life is great.  I can't think about what I could have done different because it seems sort of self defeating.   Enjoy life now as it comes.  I need a metaphorical description for this: Me standing mid stream with a waterfall that never ends behind me.  That works for me.

       unlearing what you have learned   New class starts Tuesday, the accelerated classes are great but they have a tendency to kick your ass because they are so long.  For me the covienience out weighs that fact but sometimes I wish I could cut a class like I used to but then I realize there are only six of them.  The Rapture rule and Abe if you read this you need to "buy" some as soon as possible.  Funtastic weekend, went to the Krakowdile bar in my old stomping grounds.  It was your usual small town up-nort bar and the best thing about the place is that a 20$ goes along way.

       Charles Rybicki-poet, drinker, and hunter   Most of the time I can tell really boring stories. Enough so that I can put my wife to sleep.  On one occasion we were lying in bed and she was complaining that she couldn't sleep. So I started to talk to her about science and weird shit I was making up that she sometimes believes because I make up such wonderfully good fake supporting facts.  Anyhow, I got onto the subject of how in grade school some pretentious art-fag came into our school to collect the stories of childhood or some equally insane reason.  Having the kindergarten children draw pictures and the special-ed kids drool on themselves while some unnamed 4th grader marches deeper into geekdom writing about finding the potion to save the princess from the dragons was supposed to culminate an artistic expression of kids.  This took place in the 80's and the only thing that it proved was that we were just a bunch of fucked up rural kids who had to live in our imagination to survive.  I at times complained about how high shool was cliquey and I realize that grade school was far more  brutal than high school.  At least in high school you can sneak a gun and shoot someone but in grade school it was all about fucking with their heads and making the select few feel unaccepted.  I am sure it wasn't their fault, someone saw so and so eat a booger, or the kid with the over-powering body odor that will kill you, and the random puker who throws up alot and in the weirdest places. We know who those kids are, you as well as I taunted them at one time, spilled their desk on the floor, throw their jacket into the girls bathroom, called them lesbians way before boys realized that lesbians are cool, some of them anyway. We didn't know where we were going or how we were going to get there but we were making fun of the un-cool kids and having a good time.    Wow, what a tangent but back to the pretentious art-fag(or is pretensious a part of art-fag,WTF?) one of the stories/poems/artwork that was forever imortalized in the book was written by none other than my brother.  My brother is famous for many reasons, most of them related to alcohol and the amount that you would think could normaly kill a person, but for me the fame comes from having one of the best pieces of prose published in a small "indie" pubilcation. Fuck, we're all art-fags.      Dog Named Jack     by: Charles Rybicki  I had a dog named Jack He puked on the rail road tracks Train came by, flew so high It hit the engineer right in the eye!     How cool would it be to have a poem in a book that was kept in the library at school that contained the work puke.  Granted the wording of the poem isn't the best and you assume it was the puke, not the dog, that hit the engineer.  My brother was light years ahead of his fellow second graders as he was exercising his artistic license, at true renaissance man, trapped in a boys body.  If I remember correctly my story contained something about kids finding buried treasure and then dying. I was really into the choose-your-own-adventure books back in the day and that is how most of them went. It was either that or some star wars/star trek/medieval times/superspy story that most likely sucked.  Are you asleep yet?

I now know how annoying the cats can be when you are home with them, the sad part is that it is only 8 AM.  Of course being sick meant that I didn't get much hunting done.  People laugh when I tell them that I hunt animals.

       The Desert   I was a whirlwind of work today.  I seen well over 95K pass in front of my eyes today in terms of orders.  I wish I could just call people and order stuff for myself like I do at work. Oh, yeah that's right, I don't own or run a multi-million dollar company, silly little me.  I conquered that stack of papers that you put off till the last minute. I've conquered the emergency that was flung at me from the edges of my view.  I've dealt with them all today-people, problems, and ideas - all conquered underfoot.

        HRM  I was surprised to learn about my interview/interviewing skills.  I personally have not participated in a real interview.  My current position was temp-to-hire and the interview consisted of a few yes/no questions and then a phone call telling me that I could have the job if I wanted it.   Taking the Interview  I was surprised to find that my interviewing skills, I felt, were very good and that I had no problem in an interview type setting. Obviously this wasnt a real interview so the pressure of first impressions was not a factor and the realism wasnt there but it still gave me a good idea of how I would function in an interview.  I still feel that my lack of having ever had an in depth interview has seriously impedes my interview skills.  Most of my interview experience was in high school for industrial farming and super market type settings in small rural towns that judged you more on character and criminal record than anything else.   Giving the Interview  When it was my turn to give and interview I was drawing on a complete lack of experience and only being able to come up with what I thought were good questions to answer.  It was pointed out to me that I word my questions wrong, I use the phrase you will instead of you may which could possibly lead the candidate to feel uncomfortable and make them think the job may be full of high pressure situations or unwanted stresses.  It was also pointed out to me that I used supervisor/manager to denote a group of people instead of associates so they feel like they would be equals.

       The weather is affecting me, but I still am on the rebound from an exceptionally wonderful Tuesday.    I've been thinking about places I've been and the feelings they conjure up when I think of them.  California San Jose and then Bakersfield?(San Fran area) - I remember it in two stages, once as my adolescent memory trips visions of dark nights with yellow sodium-powered street lamps and another as my adult mind really just wondering why anyone would want to live in California.  I remember it being fast when I was young and when I was just recently in California it seemed like everyone was lost or searching.  Missoula Montana - amazed, enchanted, and enthralled with that state.  Beautiful mountains, interesting city-scapes and that feeling only sitting in a bar where people are trying to sell rifles and pistols while drunk to buy more liquor can only produce.  People actually enjoying life, hitch hikers, hunters and drifters. Lots of hippies too.  Texas - Dallas to be exact, large city of never ending shopping malls and parking lots. Deep Ellum is at least interesting for about 30 minutes, a whole 15 minutes longer than the rest of Dallas.  Scott and James, good times were had and it makes me only wish we had longer.  Mexico - Dirty, damned dirty, sometimes smelly. Only in the confines of the nice resort can I appreciate the weather, the beer at 10 AM and refried beans with every meal.  Smelly-Cow cheese attributes to the smell.  Although most of my thoughts are negative I will always remember the sun, sand, love, sea breeze, lazy, Jack Kerouac, Monster Garage, cheap smokes, sales people, bargaining, shopping.  I hope now that I updated maybe Abe will too.   I see that  urlLink Amanda  has her priorities straight...

       gutter...   We were at a bowling alley last night visiting a cousin and I wasn't really shocked by people that I share the same age demographic with but more so repulsed.  Tattoos are cool, I'd like more but when your teeth are fucked up and you could stand to go to the dentist, I would think a little monetary discretion is in need. Although, after you've been to jail seven times maybe that kind of shit takes a backseat to those intimidating flame tattoos with skulls.    Recording is going well, I guess, sometimes I wonder why I still play the guitar. I could focus so much more energy into being lazy.  Actually I'm pretty thrilled at how the songs sound with the guitar tracks that we are going to discard and re-record anyway.  I wish I could swallow my poor self music image and just get to recording my songs and do the album of stuff I always wanted to do.  I've decided the acoustic deal just won't fly so I'm thinking about talking to the Pony about doing something, we've talked but most of it was "wouldn't it be cool if..." kind of talk but I think that we could just lay down some riffer guitar and riffer drums and get a guest vocal spots from Nick Fahini and Killer.

Bob Burns was cool too, Chuck Berry RnR riffs abound, but not overplayed/used.  The best quote of the night was  "Do you guys trip?, Because that ending was cool."

       YO JOE!   When I was young a friend of mine and I were really into the GI Joe and the military. After a late night viewing of  Red Dawn  on TBS one summer night we decide that we too could run around town and fight the good fight.  We grew up in  urlLink Krakow  Wisconsin which still is a very small town with not a lot of people living there and the majority being old.  Actually now most of the backyards that we ran through, retreating from the commies, are now host to young families and the like.  Out with the old and in with the young.  We had a summer ritual of shoplifting batteries to power our walkie talkies and to steal a pack of smokes from our parents so we could look cool while "liberating" the communists.  We usually started behind the old rectory building down on the river banks. We would recruit other neighborhood kids to help us on our missions and set our battle plans.  We didn't really have an objective, it was basically criss-cross across town and then "fight" our way back to the river where we spent the rest of the day throwing things into the river trying to make the biggest splash we could.  The units were BYOG so the variety of weapons ranged from the futuristic to the very almost real replicas. This was in the early 90's so we didn't have the wussy orange tips and groups of delinquents armed with guns weren't seen as a threat to national security and none of us were ever shot at by the police. Actually the police visited the town once a year because nothing ever happened, it was a boring little place hence our use of our imagination to make it exciting.  Starting from HQ, which was a tree fort by the river, we would make our way across town through backyards, over fences, and stopping in gardens for a radish or carrot ration.  That's were we made real enemies.  The old women in Krakow were all well accomplished gardeners and had nice clean and large gardens.  At first we would just take them, but when they found those size eight and nine foot prints in their garden all hell broke loose.  Phones rang, kids were grounded, our army was whittled down to nothing.  It was time to fight back.  We change our hours, we were strictly now a covert ops group that operated at night.  Garbage in mailboxes, door bells ringing at 1 AM, and the occasional smashed pumpkins/seasonal decoration.  It really was all harmless fun and now all of the old ladies are dead.  I reminisce the most when I am at my self defeating best.

      Well it really is a Friday for me, I am not sure what is going on though.  I feel a little disconnected today. Not being able to focus but maddeningly joyful smilely complacent.  Motivation to attack the list of demands that I have placed upon myself is greatly lacking.  Beer being my only option for after work activities followed by making dinner for Jenny and I.  Dizzy Gillespie is a find way to end a Friday at work, I suggest you all try it.

       hit the pavement   Really looking forward to the trip to Wyoming we are planning to take in May. I know it is a long time away but for some reason I am really looking forward to seeing Wyoming and driving. All of the times I have been to the western US, I had flown and never really viewed and took in the scenery until I landed at my destination.  I'm also excited about a possible trip to Marquette with Jenny to visit friends.  For some reason that town really strikes a chord with me, the isolation is the only turnoff for me.  2004 means one additional week of vacation for me and that has me really excited about what Jenny and I get to do. More camping trips and just day trips. I also look forward to our yearly journey to Wisconsin Dells for double-feature drive-in movies.

Bitch and whine, and it isn't even anything I can joke about because the moment I call them useless fags the new HR guy will walk through the door and apply one of many thousand government laws that goes against calling co-workers fags or any other type of word besides "hey you".  When I am done with school, around 2035, I will open my own company just so I can hire and fire annoying people.  The ass-kissers are my fave, there are Gen Xers and then there are ass-kisser and as much as I am grouped into the X-people, fuck just forgot what I was going to type.

      I was really pissed about something about an hour ago and now for the life of me I can't remember what it was.  It was this intense anger/worry that just totally brought me down and now I can't even remember what I was all worked up over.  I think it had something to do with work and then I realized that when I leave work I need to leave those feelings at work.

       liquids  Things I drank last night:    Bud Light  vodka  red wine    At the KI center in Green Bay they have a small little corner by the men's pisser that has Mac flat panel movie displays that are interactive. They showcase the features of the center and they have little touch-sensitive keyboards/mouse on pedestals.  It was very cool, almost quasi-futuristic-robots and shit. Drunk me really wanted to steal one the flat panels(I don't even own a mac, they just looked cool) untill I saw the sign that said "this area is monitored by cameras".  I am glad that my better judgement could surface over the alcoholic sea I created within my blood/brains.  Also, I am sure Jenny would kick my ass before the police arrived so either way I would learn my lesson.

      1. Nickname in high school?     I don't recall having one.  2. Sport you were into?      golf  3. Had a circle of friends?      Yeah, freshman and sophomore year I had the drug users and then for junior and senior it was the rejects.    4. Best subject?      Mostly art and music. Science was the only class that I did well in besides all of the other boundary-less classes.  5. Worst subject?      Math, that and most of the teachers I for math were dicks.   6. A teacher you owe life lessons to?     Easy, Mr. Jarock(Lenny) he opened up my eyes to the wonderful world of fiction and George Orwell  7. A teacher you wanna kick in the ass?      That crack-head bleach-blonde fucktard that taught us "careers". Bitch still has my jaw harp.  Describe ...  8. Freshman year: = Grade 9      A haze of smoke and movies along with a soundtrack that would mean the presence of hippies.  9. Sophomore year: = Grade 10      A little less haze and a whole lot more metal.  10. Junior year: = Grade 11      Jazz music being one of my new found interests. I seem to relate years of high school to either music or drugs. Going into senior year it seemed that I was reeling from the "having to grow up" phase and trying to stay in the "live in your parents basement" phase.  11. Senior year: = Grade 12        Senior hill was weird, most people started to cross the lines of the cliques and tried to be friends with everyone. Christ, there were people I never wanted to be friends with let alone share oxygen, but people were determined to prove to themselves that they weren't vapid shallow pricks and be dammed if they were going to leave high school labeled as such.  I am not angry, is sounds like I am but I am really not.    12. Your best friend was?      Adam,Jeffy,Aaron,jOe,Jake,Brent(oh where is this man, gift to writing and far out thinking)Scooter,JakeDana,Jessika,James,James,Dan,Nicole,Jill,Chuck. The GVC was in effect for most of my freshman/sophomore years.  13. Your worst friend was?        I didn't have a worst friend, one time Adam "stole" a girlfriend of mine and I didn't talk to him for a year but then she screwed him over too and we realized that she was a psycho and we're better people now so, yeah. Whaaa?  14. Cafeteria food sucked?        If you were to busy "feeling your hair grow, dude" because of all the ephidrine and stimulants(natural/un-natural) you were on you didn't eat a whole lot.   15. Most hilarious school rule?        No Smoking, seriously fuck that, I wanted to hang in jazz practice, smoke with the instructor and listen to Miles Davis,Parker,and Coltrane and crank out some crazy Be-bop.  16. Wore uniforms?           only in marching band  17. How was the prom?        How the fuck do you think it was?  18. Who was prom king and queen?        Some pretentious jerks who are now practicing metrosexuals*.  This is purely conjecture but I have a feeling I am more than likely right.  19. Any achievements?        I had the best attendance to jazz practice, I even have a plaque somewhere.  20. Were you popular?         I don't know. People knew who I was, not really what I was about but I am sure they said, "oh, that guy...."  I didn't seek to be popular because I don't think I could survive in that social environment. I think my friends and I had more fun than they did because we did more drugs and drank more than those stuck-up pussies.  21. Best song that reminds you of high school?        Anything White Zombie or NIN, for 2-years I had a NIN/White Zombie tape stuck in my car stereo(no FM in that 1981 Chevette).    *This may or may not show how up with down I am. I've heard Fred use it and I believe anything Fred says for gospel, except for that velociraptor story which was second hand from Nash anyway, that dude is fucking cracked.

       Happy Birthday Chuck!!   Charles Rybicki-poet, drinker, and hunter   Most of the time I can tell really boring stories. Enough so that I can put my wife to sleep.  On one occasion we were lying in bed and she was complaining that she couldn't sleep. So I started to talk to her about science and weird shit I was making up that she sometimes believes because I make up such wonderfully good fake supporting facts.  Anyhow, I got onto the subject of how in grade school some pretentious art-fag came into our school to collect the stories of childhood or some equally insane reason.  Having the kindergarten children draw pictures and the special-ed kids drool on themselves while some unnamed 4th grader marches deeper into geekdom writing about finding the potion to save the princess from the dragons was supposed to culminate an artistic expression of kids.  This took place in the 80's and the only thing that it proved was that we were just a bunch of fucked up rural kids who had to live in our imagination to survive.  I at times complained about how high shool was cliquey and I realize that grade school was far more  brutal than high school.  At least in high school you can sneak a gun and shoot someone but in grade school it was all about fucking with their heads and making the select few feel unaccepted.  I am sure it wasn't their fault, someone saw so and so eat a booger, or the kid with the over-powering body odor that will kill you, and the random puker who throws up alot and in the weirdest places. We know who those kids are, you as well as I taunted them at one time, spilled their desk on the floor, throw their jacket into the girls bathroom, called them lesbians way before boys realized that lesbians are cool, some of them anyway. We didn't know where we were going or how we were going to get there but we were making fun of the un-cool kids and having a good time.    Wow, what a tangent but back to the pretentious art-fag(or is pretensious a part of art-fag,WTF?) one of the stories/poems/artwork that was forever imortalized in the book was written by none other than my brother.  My brother is famous for many reasons, most of them related to alcohol and the amount that you would think could normaly kill a person, but for me the fame comes from having one of the best pieces of prose published in a small "indie" pubilcation. Fuck, we're all art-fags.      Dog Named Jack     by: Charles Rybicki  I had a dog named Jack He puked on the rail road tracks Train came by, flew so high It hit the engineer right in the eye!     How cool would it be to have a poem in a book that was kept in the library at school that contained the work puke.  Granted the wording of the poem isn't the best and you assume it was the puke, not the dog, that hit the engineer.  My brother was light years ahead of his fellow second graders as he was exercising his artistic license, at true renaissance man, trapped in a boys body.

       Clutter   I started to go through my "treasures" last night, getting ready for the move and I realized that I have a lot of junk.  Well, some of it is junk, I have boxes of toys - old and new - various video game sytems and a large selection of instruments, recording/mixing devices, and all the usually miscellaneous effects/plugs/switches/ect. all which will need to be packed and labeled.  One thing I am finding is that I come across stuff that I haven't been able to locate for the past year or so and then I realize that as soon as I pack it up that I probably will not be able to locate it for another year.

       house buying blues   The house we liked and were ready to possibly put a bid in was sold after we looked at it.  It must not have meant to be. It was across the street from the cemetery and that meant that my re-animator project could've started...  Speaking of zombies and dead/creepy/evil trappings, we toured a house in Pulaski that at one time(the 50's) it was a swinging joint. A bar and a fireplace in the basement as well as in the living room.  There was a diner booth in the kitchen and everything in the house was straight out of the 50's.  The thing about the house, besides the horrendous colors, was the creepy feeling the house gave us.  Jenny was afraid to open some of the doors, as was I.  Come to think of it, there was an over abundance of doors in this house.  I was hoping/expecting to find a body in one of the random closets.  Normally this would fascinate the hell out of me and I would love this but I've never been this creeped out in a house.  We were both positive that something awful happened there but she wouldn't elaborate what she thinks did.  I was thinking more along the lines of Silence of the Lambs because a doctor used to own the house.  Jenny was positive he died there because there was an "old man Cadillac" in the garage and the house smelled like old people.  The house was located in the center of town, I think that so if a vortex to Hell sucked it in that it would take the whole town with it.

       Its all right   Shit is weird right now.  Lots of band stuff happening and lots of family stuff going on. My grandpa passed away last Monday and I am seeing a lot of family that I really never get to see.  It is cool but at the same time I am starting to see how this side of my family functions, or in our case dysfunctions.  The house thing is getting me down now too, we still haven't found one that we like and the one we did, the sellers were being dicks.  I really wish we could find a house in the country-ish area in the Pulaski school district, the close to Green Bay the better.

       feeling it   When I'm insanely nervous and not upset, just worrying for someone else I sing aloud with what ever is playing.   Outkast was on and I found myself singing along to the choruses(I cannot rap, I am white), rather loudly.  Its funny that when I'm not worrying about myself I act the way I want to act, not aware of my own self perceived weaknesses or inadequacies, unfortunate that the trials of some one else's human spirit makes me be free in my expression of myself.  I think I am coming around to the value that self expression is more important than self preservation, not in a GG Allin type of way, but the preservation of personal truths that I cling to so that my world works. Tis utter fucking chaos man, deal with it.  Show tonight, last Something to Do show ever. Kind of sad but not really as the kids/adults never really utilized it the way it could've been. It had the life of the Concert Cafe but in a much smaller time span. It was cool at first but after a while people stopped going because how many, in the STD's case, metal shows can you really go to.  The cost is 10$ and starts at 5pm and while it is kind of steep, you get to see us DM and Mr. Slate. I was told we play at 9 pm, if you show up and you cannot find any members of Numbers Don't Lie(ex Echo7) look for us at the Nothern Lights which is located next door.  AND AS A SPECIAL SUPER KICK YOUR ASS, ROCK YOUR FACE OFF BONUS you get to see us with our old drummer Jesse and Dan from Mr. Slate, who will be singing a song with us that was recorded for the new album and is very magically David bowie like. He(Dan) is very amazing and talented.  urlLink ask me a ?

       cheap   Beer is incredibly cheap in a town of drunks.  Not that I am giving Pulaski a bad name, I'm just not helping.    It is depressing when you overhear a conversation from an older lady, maybe in her early sixties, about how she doesn't' care about "stuff"(her word) anymore and wouldn't mind dying just so she can be done with it.  One of the bartenders knew my uncle Jimmy and we talked about how he was killed by a drunk driver(I was a drunk walker tonight folks) and it was cool. I got to ask her what kind of person he was since I never met him(he died in '79, I was born in '78) and I received a satisfactory answer, my only misgivings on the conversation was the fact that for my three tappers of Bud she had six mixed drinks that were pretty hefty on the alcohol side.  I finished the night at the Corner Club and watched the Brewer game and made some friends with the geriatrics at the bar. It was fun and made me realize that people still do live in a bubble of not really knowing the outside world.  I was called a "big city" person because I live in Green Bay(of all places) for eight years before I moved back here to Pulaski.  It made me feel good about myself and all the stuff I've accomplished so far in life.  Recap - Beer and old people who are depressed and want to die make Josh a happier person.  Not saying my life sucks by any means, it is just that I know I will never be one of those ultra-cynical old people at a bar in Pulaski. Avoiding that path that is traveled by these people will be my goal in life.  I also just thought of something else, maybe it isn't the fact that they are in a small town depression. It could be that they are not caught up by all the trappings of city retire-ees that are substituting their depression with money and materialistic possessions, maybe life does suck and these people are more in touch with that notion that the others who decide to avoid it with their status/money/possessions. Probably not but it could be true.  I've been drinking and to take me seriously would be a folly on you.

       Technology will save the day...  Trying to get up the energy to go and do something. Jenny said I didn't have to unpack or anything un-fun since she is celebrating a co-workers birthday and leaving me here in Pulaski with the kitties.  I tried to get a hold of Amanda but I am sure she is busy now.  I'm going to go and visit the old drunks at Wickas.  This should be fun and a learning experience to boot.  Old Milwaukee, save me...  This beer is for all the Poles who've gone before me. Buy our new album, I'm sitting here listening to it and I still am not sick of it even though I've played the songs 50 trillion times.

       Moving, as always, is one of the things that I enjoy the least. If there ever was a hell that would be designed for me it would be moving, unpacking, moving, unpacking for all eternity while I was forced to listen to a classic rock station that owns four CDs.  I love "classic rock"(which now pertains to Alice and Chains and Nirvana, apparently) and could listen to it for at least four days straight.  The only problem is when they play the same playist every two hours, it tends to get monotonous and boring.  That is why we were listening to the hip hop/rap station while painting.  The dj's being the most entertaining aspect of this station only to be topped by the listeners that call in.  The age of the callers is funny too, "I'd like to give a shout out to all my dogz at Eisenhower Elementary" and "This goes out to the hatters(haytas,Sp?) at Jefferson Middle School for dissin' mah homies" and so on.  The age and vocabularical(new word?) skillz of the homies is mad. I don't understand the predilection with the urban/rapper/hip hop genre. I can deal with Goth's, they normally don't talk to you and the only thing you have to tell them to do is speak up and not look at the floor while talking to you.

       good, great, or does not apply   The sun is shining and that is doing wonders for my mood at work.  The sea of boiling rage is now at a simmer. I'm not an angry person by any means, but lately something at work has been driving me into a rage that I have to suppress with cigarettes and pure will power.  Its all good now, the only thing I'm bummed about is now that it is drying up outside I have to finish scraping and painting the door on the front of the house.  It actually is wood work that frames the front door, there are some mini-column type wood work with ridges and crown molding framing the outside of the ridged wood. It looks cool but is hard to explain.

       rain  This fucking weather is a joke. One minute I'm happy smiling the next I'm compiling a list of depressey songs that I want to listen to or record when I get home. This sucks, at least I'll get use out of the mixing board and reel-to-reel I have.  Time to blow the dust off the acoustic and get all mopey.

       lord manhammer   I was digging around on Amazon.com looking for some Galaxy Rangers on DVD and of course I always stray off course and ended up looking at Star Wars RPG books and it got me thinking about D&D.  It has been a while since I've sat down with some friends and played a game.  Gash and I have been talking about playing but I need to recruit more people.  I'm thinking that my cousin can play, seeing as how is the age that I was when I got into games.  Good lord am I a dork, but I can't wait until I actually get around to playing again. Maybe a game of Hero Quest will satiate my appetite for that form of geekery.

      I'm obsessed with a restaurant in Marquette, Michigan that serves a Tomato Basil soup that it the best I've ever tasted.  I'm trying to find a recipe online that would be comparable to the one used at the restaurant. All that I know for sure is heavy cream, olive oil, tomato, and basil - for sure, I don't know about the rest. Bread, got to have the right bread, like a baugett style. The garden is in thanks to some family members and the creepy neighbor guy fixed my father-in-law's roto-tiller so I could commence to gardening.

       I don't want to fuck this up, just get it right   Three hours of sleep, an awesome show by  urlLink Skeleton Key  and seeing friends that I haven't seen in a while.  Then Cactus Club is cool and I love the set-up, albeit a bit small it is nice to see knew venues.  The bar next door was the Palomino and they had 2$ pints of Guiness and 1$ Old Style and/or Blatz.  That place was nice too, the menu was nice too and they have stuffed deer mounts on the wall.  We are playing at Ryan's Ballroom tonight, FREE BEER so show up if you want.  We also play on Saturday at the Main Stage.  I don't know what time it starts, usually around 10pm.  Come see us, avoid Soul Burner I've been told two words that are already making me dread them "Metallica medley", you and I have been forewarned.  I'm sleep drunk, tired but not achey, just lucid and I find myself still dancing to Skeleton Key songs.

       Saturday -Woke up kind of early, went to Green Bay with Jenny and a list of things to accomplish/buy. Finally have my new contacts and I can throw out my old pair. Night and Day are nice but they are kind of expensive and they seem to be the only type that I can wear and it doesn't feel like I have a hair or finger in my eye.  Mowed the lawn with Jenny and here "Zen Mowing" technique.  Played a show at the Main Stage that night and before the show Doug and I were talking about lawn care and how when I'm fifty I'll be in the yard yelling at birds and people who look at my lawn because I WANT IT PERFECT!!! Not really, I just want it to look nice. It seems that when mowing I can concentrate on specific items instead of being all over the place.  I came up with some lyrics to songs that I write all day in my head, I analyzed the first half of  Desolation Angels  in my head and decided to re-read my Kerouac collection for what seems the 30th time. Mowing also makes me miss my  Zen And The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance  that I can hopefully get back from Fred in August.  The show went well and not much happened after that, I bailed on Steps after the show but I had busy day coming up on Sunday.  Sunday -Woke up even earlier than usual, bought doughnuts/pastries at the bakery that sells the best in high fat, high calorie foods in the world.  I recommend the cheese and strawberry croissant and the rasberry twist.  We had my mom and step-dad over, along with Jenny's parents and sisters for a cookout.  It went well and the only left over we had is some pasta salad and a pile of mixed vegetables and dip. The highlight of the day was the game we were playing.  I set up a badmitton net and we played that for a while but Nicci decided we should play a game from our childhood.  It was like hot potato but we didn't use numbers we used things like, "pick a candy bar" or "80's TV sitcom"(I picked that topic when I was "it", decidedly it was a bad choice because not everyone is a dork like me and picks such things).  It was a blast, my only complaint was that we didn't play longer.

       I'm crushing your head   This stress/anger/hate/outrage/whatever is crushing my psyche into my head, forming a ball of me, looking out.  I'm a confused person right now.  Jenny is my only hope but I hate unloading this frustration on her because she doesn't need that crap now.

       Dumptruck   Jenny called me during Kill Bill 2, hysterical that Dumptruck can't move her hind legs and that she has fallen out of a window, I too was all worked up. I had that pit form in my stomach, the worry and the sadness.  So I meet Jenny at the  Animal Emergency Hospital  in Green Bay, which is located next to  Heavenly Hams  (Don't worry Fluffy has gone to a better place!!!) in a strip mall.  I was put off until I walked in and saw the pile of Cat Fancy magazines I knew Dumptruck would be in good hands.  Dr. Mau came in to talk to us and said that our cat is fine and asked us a few other questions which I am sure pertained to him trying to see if there could be some sort of outside neurological poisoning ala plants and cleaners that could have affected her.  As with Dumptruck, and Splooge too, I would spend any amount short of a couple thousand dollars to ensure our cats outlive us and join the apes after the apocalypse so Dumpy spent the night with the other animals.  They assured me they would play with her and giver her the attention she needs. Dumptruck it the SPK5000( S elf  P etting  K itty 5000) and she will make sure you give her the attention she needs so I just laughed it off and said under my breath to myself "You too will understand the control, the CONTROL OF THE KITTIES!!!" Ok, not really but this story is getting kind of boring and I had to try and make it more interesting.  I wanted to make the vet hold the phone to the cage at 3 in the morning and yell "WAKE UP!!!!" into her temporary home like she does to me, except she stands on my head and does the mystery dance that cats do to get me up so that I can pet her.  I got up extra early today(5:30) so I could pick her up and bring her home. She promptly kicked Splooge's ass and went to bed on her blanket. Dumptruck rules.

       Mini-recap   4th - Lots of fun, lots of beer.  The police even made a surprise visit to tell us it wasn't the fourth anymore and to keep the noise down.  5th - Practice, nothing much to talk about there. The rest of the week so far has been kind of boring, Fred is still in town and Thursday is looking like Mongolian BBQ style and drinks, I'm sure, at Steps.  Also, I guess it is official that 29 steps is sold and the new owner will be taking over soon. I've also heard, pretty much first hand that the place will not change. Well, the bathrooms may be cleaner and the jukebox will be changed but that should be about it.

       green thumb    Our garden is nothing but a pile of various breeds of tomato plants.&nbsp; I can't believe how well they've grown so far, I have green tomatoes already and I'm sure I'll have a ton more.&nbsp; I think I should become a tomato farmer. All&nbsp;day in the fields, obsessed with their safety and viability.&nbsp; I'd forsake personal hygiene to spend my days tending my tomatoes. I'd soon realize that I don't have any onions and would soon have to share my time between fruit and bulbs.&nbsp; I would then feel bad because I am spending more time with the tomatoes than the onions or feel that I am not giving them the attention they need.&nbsp; I would cry in the fields till I sleep.

       Necrotitis   This sucks, I have a bug bite on my arm that has festered to a bubbly thing that makes my arm hurt and my body ache.  The doc got all CSI on me with the swabbies and I won't know until Friday, nothing but fun. Could be Lyme's Disease, could be Unga Bunga Fever, or just a simple cold-sore on my flesh. Neat-O.

       Extra Sleep   This morning I got up took a shower and returned to bed. Jenny said she would get me up in time to get the both of us to work in a timely matter.  In that time I had a dream. It could've been about the future, and omen, a vision from the place that I cannot go.    I was wandering a desert, it wasn't really hot but it was yellow and orange, all deserty and shit.   I was armed, very well, with a variety of weapons from the ancient to the futuristic.  The next part is what I call the FRED FACTOR. Any time I have a dream involving zombies, I blame it on Fred.  This was a zombie hoard, massive amounts, I was like the Gov. Ventura in Predator dropping those zombies like mad. Machine gun empty, no problem, you have a rocket launcher, out of rockets, shit, just use the head/brain seeking rifle that takes out multiple zombies.  This was all relatively quick, edited like an action movie. I was disappointed as there wasn't a discernible soundtrack as most of my dreams have. After this sequence of carnage I locate a metal box with a read button. I push the button  and the dream gets all animated and a bolt of lighting/plasma/hot stuff shoots down from the sky destroying all the zombies.  Cut to a scene of me sitting in an attic aiming a shotgun at the trap door with the words "Part 2" underneath me.  I was asleep for 10 minutes.

       MY HEAD IS FILLED WITH SAWDUST   Thursday  - Pre-Polka Day(s) - mostly hung out with Jenny,Amanda,jOe,alissa,and Jenny at the bar and ended up waking up Friday morning hung over.  Friday  - Polka Day(s), fun drinking outside. Watching my sister sneak beer in front of the oblivious cops with me being the worrying brother. Ah well....  Saturday Kewaunee Co. Fair - Food, carneys, rides and games that you cannot win except for the dart game and then the only prize you win is a mirror with tupac and a pot leaf on it.  AC/DC and KISS cover/tribute bands, at times if you closed your eyes it sounded good.  Tangent  What is with all the west coast chopper bullshit? Dude, you're 15 settle down if some other twit picked the last west coast chopper poster, here is your Tupac.  Sunday  I BURNED!!!!!! It sucked.  Monday  Did most of the painting and wood sealing I've been putting off for the pas two months.
