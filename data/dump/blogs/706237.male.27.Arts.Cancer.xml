        Heresy is only another word for freedom of thought.  - Graham Greene     So I finished Steven Johnson's  urlLink Emergence book . It is excellent. I moved on to  urlLink Moment of Complexity  by Mark C. Taylor. It is turning out to be quite fascinating as well. Complexity theory, also sometimes called emergence. Even though this field of study is relatively new, in my opinion it could very well be shaping into that unified theory of everything that all the physicists, biologists, scientists, etc. are desperately seeking. I find it particularly relevant to game development, design, and mechanics.   When I am finished with Moment of Complexity I will be moving on to  urlLink Six Degrees , and eventually  urlLink Digital Biology . This should complete my coverage of the topic for now, though I have about 4-5 more books on the subject in my Amazon.com Wish List. But alas I also have about 45 other books waiting for me in "the pile" as it is affectionately becoming known. One thing of particular additional interest about the complexity theory studies is that it has led me to the topic of  urlLink memetics , which I have also allocated space in my Amazon Wish List towards  urlLink a book  on the topic. This should prove quite fascinating in addition to complexity/emergence concepts and give me a much better understanding of not only the world in general, but the media to which I currently devote my life (games).   On the fiction front, I am reading  urlLink Snow Crash  by Neal Stephenson, which is turning out to be quite the entertaining ride. Of interesting coincidence is the theme of information passed as virus - which I stumbled across as memetics in my diligent search for more books on complexity theories and emergence. However, I'm starting to think that perhaps this is not really coincidence, and more along the lines of an organized or intended serendipity, though I realize that is somewhat of an oxymoron. I have a feeling that my probing into the depths of memetics may answer this question. In many ways I find this both ironic and symbolic. Self-education is a beautiful thing because of its potential to suprise and captivate impressions of wonder in the individual during the process of gaining knowledge and enlightenment itself. It is this curiosity which pushes me forward and drives the inner cravings of my identity as a person.   Signing off for now...   -Eric von Rothkirch

          Though I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, yet I was, by the endeavor, a better and happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it. - Benjamin Franklin    The start of another workweek always seems to coincide with my renewed sense of ambition and personal goals. I sometimes find it of trivial disappointment that some of those goals lie outside of my career path, or at very least, outside of the necessities of duty to which I am engaged on a daily basis due to the nature of my job. What I find ironic about this situation is that some of the extra-curricular pursuits in my life would greatly benefit the way I do my job, though from outside appearances engaging in the activities which would be of great benefit to my job can seldom be justified. I can imagine this is the case for most people. Take for example, the reading of non-fiction subjects. Many of the works I read outside of my daily job could quite appropriately be applied to the daily governing practices of game development. However, it would be quite obvious to point out that if I were to read during my workday it would not only produce a decline in my output of actual work, but also be highly frowned upon by others. While I agree with the tradeoff inherent in the first effect - that my output of actual work would decline, I think the perceptive observations inherent in the second effect are unnecessary. But alas, so it must be that extra-curricular reading must take place outside of my daily duties. However, I often wonder about the unintended negative side effects of such a seemingly widespread social attitude towards reading or the appropriation of knowledge. Too often it seems we work harder instead of smarter, whereas a small shedding of illumination upon a subject might reveal an entirely new mode of thought or practice that increases productivity either quantitively or qualitively over the course of time. To illustrate this kind of negative side-effect, let me refer to an entry from an amusing book I recently acquired called  urlLink Business Babble: A Cynic's Dictionary of Corporate Jargon ...    corporate culture   n.  The defining ethic of a company, expressed in speech, dress and behavior deemed proper at the firm, which are carefully designed to ward off the incursion of dangerous new ideas.   While this book is not to be taken entirely seriously, like most good humor, it contains a degree of painful truth to it. It does not only apply to corporations, but individuals as well. In my experience many individuals seem to control their own daily thoughts, actions, and feelings with a certain kind of 'personal culture' if you will. It is like a feedback loop of beliefs, thoughts, or opinions which only reward the discovery of similarly-minded ideas and as a result, forms a sort of rejection of new concepts or ways of doing things. When witnessed on a mass-scale, this sort of human tendency can be quite frightening. The only thing I've discovered which alleviates this condition both on the individual and the mass level is self-education, learning, and the appropriation of knowledge. One of the best ways to achieve this is through a healthy diet in reading of both fiction and non-fiction. This is where most people seem to fall short, and rely upon their longstanding closed feedback loops of similar ideas to the ones they already hold. This sort of attitude is tantamount to the literal definition of ignorance. Every individual retains a certain degree of ignorance, but it should be the goal for many to be at very least, aware of this ignorance and to take action in order that they might counter-balance it. This sort of homeostasis of the human mind is one of the underlying causes for human evolution. We already operate in this way on a basic level but many of us reject new ideas as a form of bad habit instilled within us at some point in our past. Self-improvement through education is not only a way that we might increase the value of our surroundings through thoughts, action, and communication, but also a way to increase personal satisfaction in our daily lives.   I could almost write an essay on this, so I'll stop for now and perhaps continue this at another time. :-)  Signing off...  - urlLink Eric von Rothkirch

          Tax time nears for those of us who procrastinate, like me.  I have a serious gripe which carries over from last year: the electronic filing system. What I find really stupid about electronic filing is that you still need to mail in paper forms. What's the point of electronic filing then? There's the argument that it helps speed the process up, though I'm not looking for speed - I'm looking for convenience. The most common thing complained about by me and most I know is that taxes are a hassle. The reason is because of the paperwork involved. So last year I went online and filed electronically. It makes the process easier by breaking the process down into a series of questions. God forbid you have to read the same thing on your tax form! At the end of the process it is requested that you send paper versions of your filing otherwise the process will not be complete. Hello? Whose stupid idea was this? Why is electronic filing any help then?  Personally, I think the IRS is a bunch of idiots adhering to antiquated systems of bureacracy. What would be nice is if the IRS had all your information - which they do anyway through your W2, and could use that to determine how much you owe. The only missing factor is your personal status info, such as single, married, dependents, etc. The IRS could have such information on file, and when tax time rolled around it would be the responsibility of the individual to report any changes in that status. It'd be much easier to simply report status changes and have everything else figured out automatically. What's the deal with refunds anyway? If it's being refunded, why did they take it in the first place? Why can't they simply take what I owe, no more, no less?  And here's a real kicker: Why do I get taxed on my previous year's tax refund? That income has already been taxed once, the first time, when I got it in my hard-earned paycheck! Double-taxing? As if I didn't already give them enough money in the first place.  Bottom line: Our U.S. tax system is stupid. It's bad enough they take the money. But why must they take my time, energy, and patience too?

         Here I am to stream my thoughts again. Tired of talking about the war... so instead I'll write about what I've been doing lately. I have been steadily increasing my library of books over the last few months in an attempt to rid myself of ignorance in a few areas of science such as networked complexity and biology. Also quite curious about linguistics and their neurological or psychological implications towards both individuals and society as a whole. I'm rather excited to read about memes. I only wish I could have found interest in these things when I was 18. Oh how much further ahead I would be now! Oh well...  In other news, I'm doing some spring cleaning. It's funny how I can go from happily living in a state of chaos to a state of obsessive order. I am purging the old bank statements, bill and pay stubs that I seem to have collected over the last 7 years. I also don't really know how I still have so many boxes of junk after 3 moves in the last 3 years and dropping excess garbage every time. This time I'm going to be really thorough about it. No more saved parts and pieces to appliances, equipment, or devices that I no longer own. No more pack-ratness regarding every piece of plastic, screw or paper to the cd player I bought in 1992! Everything must go! Total liquidation!  Not that it's really necessary to discuss it, but I am quite happy that my finances are almost in order. I will be done paying for my car and Jennifer's ring soon, which leaves my assets free to save towards a down payment on a house. Woohoo! My apartment is nice, but I'd really like to settle in a place I can truly call 'home'. No more wasted rent, deposits, strict rules and regulations regarding what I can or can't do in an apartment complex. A garage! A place to put tools and vehicles, imagine that!!! A couple spare rooms upon which Jennifer and I could impose our fancies! Could it be Eric is truly being domesticated?

          On the Gaming Front...   So I started playing Splinter Cell last night for the PC. It's quite entertaining. It provides many of the same fun 'sneaker' conventions as Metal Gear Solid 2 with the ability to hang from ledges, choke-hold enemies, etc. Rappeling down the sides of buildings is quite fun. The story is fairly engaging, though nothing spectacular so far. Standard Tom Clancy bit, government ops to uncover international political agendas which threaten the freedom/lives of people everywhere. Suprise suprise! The voice acting is somewhat weak. As for gameplay criticisms, the levels are extremely linear. Now I'm not going to get in a linearity vs. non-linearity debate here, but even fans of the straightforward linear game might find this one a bit stifling. I guess what bothers me is that, as the main character, you play a special forces/ops agent who can go anywhere and do anything due to his training. Yet there is only one way into any given building, through the pre-planned window or door, or vent. Why not leave such choices up to the player? Part of the inherent fun in playing such a character is the critical decisions one must make while working in the field. Splinter Cell kind of fails in that aspect. The rest of the elements are quite fun however, and satisfy the desire I had to play the game - it succeeds in its goal of entertaining me despite my criticisms. Perhaps I will comment more as I get further in the game.  In other news...   More Stupid Protestors    On Saturday, the group ANSWER -- which stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism -- expects tens of thousands of demonstrators to show solidarity with an international mobilization against the US-led war on Iraq    This is exactly the kind of stuff that gets my logical blood boiling. What does racism have to do with the war in Iraq? ANSWER (laugh): Nothing. Since when were we fighting Iraq simply to satisfy racist beliefs? Strange that we have a great amount of cultural diversity in our military forces? Not exactly a truthful statement on the part of this so called ANSWER. This is how such groups love to piggyback on irrelevant issues to gain support for their ungrateful causes against the structure of our society.   "The whole world is watching to see if the people of the United States can intensify the power of the anti-war movement at the moment that the (President George W.) Bush administration is intending to slaughter tens of thousands of Iraqi people and occupy their country," ANSWER said while calling for a march to surround the White House on Saturday.    We're slaughtering tens of thousands of Iraqi people? Who are we slaughtering en mass? Iraqi regime troops perhaps. The entire loss of lives in this war so far has not exceeded 10,000 by any means. And with Saddam's regime crumbling, it looks like the war is on its way to an end. So where will we slaughter these tens of thousands? And again, I must ask, what about the 300,000+ that Saddam's regime have slaughtered? Does this not matter? According to protestors, Saddam's actions and behavior are irrelevant. Genocidal maniacs are free to continue gassing and torturing hundreds of thousands - this is what I gather from the 'message' of protestors. Terrorism is OK, according to them. Our response to Sept. 11th and any future threats should be to just ignore them, and let our people die and our freedoms be infringed upon. We should sacrifice anything and everything just to avoid war. These are the very ideals that make oppression possible.     The group has called five days of action including lobbying members of Congress, refusing to file tax declarations, which are due for most Americans on April 15.    Idiots. Total morons. Sure! Defy Uncle Sam by not paying taxes. That'll prove your ideals to the world! In reality, here's what'll really happen: Fines, and possibly jail for the individuals that refuse to file or pay their taxes. They are punishing themselves. Why not just go attack a police officer? Surely that'd be similarly effective? Oh wait, some protestors are already doing that.   And again, I must ask... don't these people have jobs? How can they afford to parade around in the streets all day long for weeks on end? My only guess is they survive on welfare, or the income of their parents or significant others. Social parasites, parading for more socialism. Go live in Cuba for a while, where you'd be arrested and sentenced to 30 years in jail for protesting the government. How's that for an oppressive government? Stop being ungrateful and taking our hard-earned freedoms for granted. Ignorant children, the lot of them.   Go cry and suck your thumbs and wrap yourselves in the peace security blankets which were paid for by others in blood. "No Blood For Oil", in reality means "No Blood for Freedom!" Is the future of our nation and planet the blatant acceptance of oppression out of the fear of war?  ANSWER == Asinine Numb Skulls Wailing Everything Rotten. They just love having something this big to cry about. It's purely a reason for them to organize against our 'oppressive government'. Like I've said, try living in a country where the oppression is real, physical, and often results in torture or murder. Where such things can happen to you for simply protesting. Protestors in the U.S. are exercising a freedom which many foreign citizens do not have in their countries. Should not those people have these freedoms too? Wake up, this is what we are trying to do in Iraq. Soon they will be able to protest their own government without fear of imprisonment, torture, or even death. Imagine that!

          A new week...   My spring cleaning was abruptly halted by the weekend, due to doing Fun Things like spending time with Jen and going to a Texas Rangers ballgame. I also saw Phone Booth this weekend, which is a pretty entertaining movie. There are lots of entertaining movies coming on the horizon, such as Matrix 2, Terminator 3, X-men 2. Sequel-itis, much like the game industry of late.   I picked up a copy of Splinter Cell, the sneaking/shooter based on Tom Clancy's book universe. I haven't had time to try it out but it should be somewhat entertaining at least. I've been itching for a decent game to play lately...  Other stuff going on, but not worth reporting just yet, so this post is suffering from a degree of lightness.  Tis all for now...

         Six Degrees is proving to be a very worthwhile addition to my vernacular of topical understandings. I've encountered some material within the book which I believe is highly relevant to game development and possibily marks an entirely new way to view game development teams and the systems which they create that inevitably interact with one another. To be more specific, the application of random-biased nets in understanding the relationships between not only team members, but the various systems that compose a game provides a better understanding of how the process of game development functions as a whole. The universalities discovered in social networks very much apply to game development teams and the systems which various members of the team are deeply entrenched. I've been taking lots of notes in one of my development journals (a hardcover notebook I keep handy) and also making comments on potential application of the findings from my exploration of these texts. I can't wait to discover what genetics hold relevant towards game development. Ok, call me crazy but I just thrive off this stuff. Tis food for a hungry mind!  I'm glad it's Friday. The weekends always bring me a peace (piece?:-) of mind I do not have during the weekdays. Perhaps this is because I feel less compressed or pressured in my daily schedule on the weekends. Ya think? ;-)  I need to kick it back into gear and do some writing soon, which I should have no problem doing with the fodder churning through my brain as a result of the research I've been doing.  Until next time...

         So I finished  urlLink Snow Crash  this morning. Overall I must say it is a very entertaining read. Suprisingly it doesn’t deal with the usual flash of sci-fi gadgets and gizmos. There is some of that, as to be expected, but relies less on them than it does on an interesting variety of concepts through which the story is woven. One of these concepts, coincidentally, is a subject I’ve been pursuing in my non-fiction reading interests for a while – memetics or  urlLink memes .  It is both ironic and symbolic that on the day that I finish Snow Crash my copy of Richard Brodie’s  urlLink Virus of the Mind  arrives from Amazon. I believe I will have to stop procrastinating on my books about complexity and emergence so that I can move on to reading about genetics and memes. This is one of those cases where I know my ignorance will be stamped out and entirely new avenues of thought will result from such self-education.   Why isn’t education a religion? When I say education, I don’t mean the dreary institutions we frequented as children or teenagers. My definition of true education is the process of absorbing new information and allocating it or applying it to the goals and troubles of one’s life. The capacity to learn or educate oneself is infinite, and strikingly similar to the “faith” of many religions. It redefines my view of modern religion. I would much rather interpret the word of God, or the gospel, as a metaphor for education – the very concept of ‘word’ being directly correlated with communication and information, the true religion of the modern age. Within Snow Crash religion is suggested as a sort of virus, or in other words, a meme. I find this concept very fascinating on many levels. Viewing religion as a meme or a set of memes is one fascination. Viewing all ideas, brands, inventions, concepts as an exchangeable unit which can be measured is another which holds yet even more fascination for me. Much like the propogation and mutation of genes, memes can evolve, mutate, or fail to do so and die. These implications have the potential to rock foundations within genetics, communications, advertising, marketing, science, religion, etc.  It is an exciting time to be alive.

         Saw Zwan last night with Jennifer. For those that don’t know Zwan is the band led by former Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. I don’t really know the album that well, but the performance was very good. After the show we went to the back of the building to see if anyone would come out, and sure enough after a while, Billy came out and said hi to the crowd of about 50 people loitering the rear parking lot of the Bronco Bowl. It’s been almost 10 years since I first saw Smashing Pumpkins live... kinda makes me feel old. Just kidding... :-P  My Amazon order arrived, in which I got  urlLink The Selfish Gene  and  urlLink The Electric Meme . Honestly I can’t say when I’ll get to these as the 50-pile of unread books still haunts me. But as the focal point of my non-fiction interests can change in a somewhat whimsical fashion I may bump The Selfish Gene up on the list.   Also in my order were two 128mb memory sticks for my digital camera. This pushes the number of photos I can take at 1280 resolution up to 560. I don’t know if my battery has enough juice to take that many pictures, but I’ll find out sometime soon. I figured it was time to get some more storage space for the camera since it’s incredibly easy to run 100+ pictures when collecting source for game textures, etc. If I take a trip to Mexico sometime this year, I’m going to need more storage space for that. Also, the cool thing about memory sticks is that there’s a USB device that allows you to use memory sticks like a floppy disk, however, the obvious difference being that you can store 128mb of data on one. Considering how small they are, this is pretty cool. So I may pick up one of those adapters at some point too.  I’m almost finished with the sci-fi novel Snow Crash. I’m interested to see how it ends and I’ll probably write a bit about it at that point. I’m eager to start another book so bringing that one to closure ‘opens the slot’ so to speak.  On the political front, I'm happy the process of establishing a new Iraqi government is underway. This promises great things for the Iraqi people. Considering the religious fundamentalism and fanaticism over there it may be a long shot, but I hope they can secure separation of church and state. I'd hate to see all this work towards a new government only to have individuals denied religious freedom, or persecuted for their beliefs.   That is all for now...

           Book Disappointments Suck...   I got to within 70 pages of the end of Moment of Complexity by Mark C. Talyor and I had to put it down. While the book offers some interesting insights (most notably in the first half) it begins to cover well-tread ground about halfway through, fizzling out in the latter half. My main criticisms of the book are not so much in its content, but the way it was written. Almost every other page contains reprinted text taken from the works of other authors, with a convoluted paraphrasing by Mr. Taylor. Not only are the constant and consistent excerpts annoying (I might as well just read those books), but his paraphrasing of scientific and sociolpolitical workings within our society are simply not written in a clear and concise manner. Mr. Taylor seems to think that in order to write well, you need to try and abstract concepts as much as possible through myriads of referential statements. He uses the philosophers Kant and Hegel's names as though they were verbs (Hegelize) and in other places as poorly formed adjectives (Hegelian, Kantian) while very seldom does he actually discuss the theories of Kant or Hegel themselves, or for what those two men are most commonly known. This basic lack of respective description which would make the book much easier to read shows a clear disregard for the average reader. Considering the book contains little hard science as well, it's difficult to tell exactly for what audience Mr. Taylor wrote this book. Towards the end of the book there are some profoundly silly attempts at altruism to cover for his garbling of text - statements made by Mr. Taylor which only emphasize the problem of his poor writing ability. Examples such as "I did not write this book, it wrote itself. It is merely text through the filter of me." etc. Then I must say Mr. Taylor, you're a very poor filter. If you're looking for good works on complexity or emergence, then I highly suggest  urlLink Emergence  and  urlLink Six Degrees . You can get them for both for the same price it'd cost you to buy Mark Taylor's book.   To cleanse my brain of disappointment in reading Moment of Complexity, I started reading Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene. It is very entertaining so far, the guy comes across like a straight shooter. He makes no excuses for what might seem to some to be extreme views on evolution and Darwinism. But this kind of forthright honesty is welcome. Much of it deals with the 'selfishness' of individuals of a species, in correlation with survival and evolution. In a strange way the justificiation of selfishness reminds me of the work of Ayn Rand. All in all, it's shaping up to be a very enjoyable read. I'll write more about this later, once I've had a chance to absorb a bit more.

           Perpetual Enlightenment    So I finished Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age last night and I must say... this is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. I guess my high opinion of the book might be a bit biased because I had already been thinking about complex networks, including social and organizational systems (businesses) and was troubled by some of the inefficiencies I’ve experienced first hand – primarly the destructively chaotic nature of game companies. What I couldn’t figure out was that, companies with strong levels of organization seem to feature the same problems as companies lacking measures of organization. What the book pointed out was how a network functions naturally, and more importantly, when it doesn’t. The topic of network robustness is an issue very important to businesses and organizations whether they realize it or not. And when I say networks, I don’t mean computer networks (although these are certainly important too). The key ‘eureka’ point was in explaining the ideal robust network of an organization means a somewhat decentralized, even power-distribution. Not power in the typical sense, but to view the hierarchy of an organization as different levels of  information processing , rather than positions authoritative judgment. Not only does this identify many of the problems I have with the organizational structure of companies, but it also suggests a solution. I will definitely be using these insights towards some writing I am doing about game development.  Needless to say the book contains a whole lot more content which is truly great, and overall it proved to be a very entertaining read which kept me thoroughly interested from beginning to end.   This is the second book I’ve read to completion about networked complexity, complexity studies, and concepts of emergence. I actually put Moment of Complexity down for a while because Six Degrees was just so interesting. I must say, I find that my interest in this topic has not nearly been satisfied enough even though as of the completion of Moment of Complexity I will have read three books about it. My lack of completeness in satisfaction is good, because I have a few more of these type of book on the way, and a few others. :-)  But before I achieve Complexity Overdose, I will probably take a short break to read about genetics in Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene. My primary interest is in the introduction of memes within that book; however I’m sure I will gain a nice stab of insight surrounding genetics as well. I do have to comment though that in some ways I’m jumping ahead because I also picked up Darwin’s Origin of Species and I kind of would have liked to start there, but the topic of memes beckons me with far greater strength, so I must obey the gravitational information pull. I have the inkling that the subject of memes will be of considerable use in application towards the construction of intellectual properties within the game industry, and on a related note will further cement concepts of positioning and marketing.  After this, I will either return to the subject of complexity studies, or I will return to some books on philosophy which I left off about 8 months ago.  I feel like a kid in a candy store. I wish I would have started pursuing non-fiction earlier in my life. Perhaps the mountain in front of me would be significantly smaller. Or perhaps it would not. ;-)

         This weekend was interesting. I got to try out my new memory sticks for my camera at Jen's family's Easter cookout/BBQ. They work pretty well, though I wish Sony wasn't so limited in the sizes. When there are 4GB flashcards and such, why must I put up with a 128mb memory stick? Surely someone at Sony must realize this technological inferiority? Ah well, at least now I can make more use of my camera.  Getting further in the book Six Degrees. Very interesting stuff. I'm not sure why I find this subject so fascinating. I want to read yet even more books on the subject. Alas, variety is the spice of life. As a result I will probably move on to other subjects first though before reading more in this area.  It's Monday. Blah.

         Scribbles...   I've had a thoroughly enjoyable experience within the past few days, one that for some reason, surprisingly, I hadn’t thought to try earlier in my cumulative efforts of design or the study of it. I sketched out some plans for a level, a layout on graph paper, and while I did so I took notes regarding things I think are important to level design. This design/draw and writing process was a highly pleasant dichotomy, when my hand got tired from printing, I took it more easy sketching casual strokes which form the outline of a level. When my thought processes built up into a roaring traffic jam while drawing out the level, I took a break to jot down some notes. Such a process has proved so very beneficial in both simultaneous form and function; it is an activity I will have to engage in more often.  Related to such writing is the observation that my technical/professional journal which I carry around with me is starting to slowly grow. As of my last writing, I surveyed everything I’ve written so far and there seems to be a highly coherent emerging theme throughout the writing, one which will help form the basis for many articles and/or chapters of a book. The iterative process of collecting one’s thoughts on related subjects within a journal has proven itself very beneficial, and is a new standard which I will continue indefinitely.

          A Plethora of Weekend Activity   The weekend was thoroughly satisfying. I helped Jen babysit her nephews on Friday night since her sister was out of town. On Saturday I got to sit in Starbucks and write some notes and do some reading while Jen was at a babyshower for one of her friends. It was nice to spend some time taking notes as I haven’t done that in a quite a while and have been sorely needing to do that. Afterwards we went and saw Identity which was pretty cool. Then we proceeded to the Fort Worth Art Festival, which is an annual event for which they close downtown to traffic and hundreds of artist booths are set up, as well as food/beer vendors. There are/were a couple of stages with bands performing. Later that evening we saw Bowling for Soup which was entertaining. I’ve only heard a couple songs from the radio so I was somewhat out of the loop so to speak. The music was ok, but the performance more than made up for it. The band is quite adept at putting on a good show, and during a brief power outage managed to keep the crowd happy with onstage antics.  As I probably mentioned in an earlier update, I’m reading The Selfish Gene which is turning out to be quite fascinating. A pile of books on memes are next after this, which should no doubt prove entertaining and educational. Then it’s on to some philosophy and psychology/neuroscience.   I started playing Devastation, since we got 100 copies sent to us at 3D Realms from ARUSH. The single-player game so far is satisfying. The story and voice acting are very cheesey and in some places downright lame, however the levels are well-constructed, look good, and are fairly fun to play. I have an extra copy so if anybody would like to trade me for something else I’d be happy to strike some sort of deal.  Alas a new week has begun yet again. All play and no work makes Eric a poor boy. :-(

         So I finished The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins. This was a highly enjoyable read and entirely relevant to game development in my humble opinion. I took away many useful concepts which will aid me in the coming years with not only my designs, but the way in which I communicate them to other people. The Evolutionary Stable Strategy is one of them which originated with John Maynard Smith:   Smith's best known work incorporated game theory into the study of how natural selection acts on different kinds of behavior. The old idea had been that selection inevitably favors organisms to act aggressively. Smith showed that this isn't necessarily true, and that selection may actually favor both aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors.   As an example, imagine that two populations, one of them aggressive (hawks) and one passive (doves). Hawks will always battle their neighbors over any resource. Doves won't fight under any circumstances. A population made up entirely of doves would be unstable; that is, if a mutation caused the introduction of a single hawk, it would have an immediate advantage, and the hawkish behavior would bully the doves out of existence.   But a hawks-only population would also be unstable. A single dove introduced by mutation would have a long-term advantage. That's because the hawks' constantly aggressive behavior leads to frequent injury, while the dove, refusing to fight, escapes that risk.   Through application of game theory, Smith showed that there is a particular ratio of hawks to doves that forms what he called an "evolutionary stable strategy" for the species. Thus, selection actually works to maintain a balance of different characteristics in the population.   The other concept I acquired from the book was a description of the game Prisoner’s Dilemma and how it might be applied to natural selection. It is a game which demonstrates that the most efficient route is through cooperation. I find it a particularly interesting study which might be useful in the creation of A.I.  And last, but certainly not least... near the end of The Selfish Gene Dawkins describes a replicator different from the gene, one that is useful to the understanding of communications. That replicator is the meme. While some have written the concept off as ‘psuedo-science’ (along with psychology and anything else that doesn’t fit their relative arbitrary standards of intellectual snobbery), I think that says more about the person snubbing than it does about memes. That said, I also think it is important to view memes as a useful concept or model way of looking at things, regardless of whether or not you view it as science or psuedo-science. Merely because an individual is, without warrant, quick to judge a concept as psuedo-science does not invalidate that concept’s usefulness. Such closed-mindedness does not benefit the interests of science or other fields, especially when coupled with the notion that we must wait until some authoritative figure, after years of controlled experiments, deems that the concept be scientifically valid. Such authoritative, and (some might say) totalitarian viewpoints seem less interested in progress than they do the might of their own convictions. This places their interpretation of what science is, or should be, much closer in association to the concept (meme) of faith.   I have no doubt that the subject of memes (meme of memes), will be extremely useful even merely as a theory relevant towards the conceptual understanding and improvement of communications, under which of course lies marketing, advertising, etc. As a result following the introduction of memes by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene, I am now reading The Meme Machine by Susan Blackmore in the hopes that I can find more appropriate application of this concept towards design and game development through the books written about it.

         I finished  urlLink The Meme Machine  by Susan Blackmore. I’m not sure what to think. It was a very entertaining read. But I’m still trying to figure out exactly what value I got from it. I certainly learned more about memes from Susan’s perspective. And she presented some of her arguments against the failures of sociobiology. I guess the question which remains is how does this help me personally? I tend to take a utilitarian viewpoint in my reading material and I often judge a book by what I can extract from it and adapt to my own life and situation. I did pick up some interesting concepts about memes which I will be able to apply to game development. But I’m still looking for a more solid foundation in terms of using memes as tools for my intended purpose – game development and marketing/positioning-driven design. Memes seem to have a great potential in this area, in the general sense so far from having read The Meme Machine. But I’m looking for more specific application of the meme meme. Perhaps I will find it within  urlLink Virus of the Mind  or  urlLink The Electric Meme . I will be reading Virus of the Mind next…  I find the cries of 'psuedo-science' towards memetics to be somewhat annoying. I don't view memetics as a science, but rather a model for viewing information. You could call it a theory of communications. Memetics has great potential in marketing and advertising, but it will take an individual to establish it in those contexts first before it will be taken seriously, of course. I think what bothers me though, is the use of 'psuedo-science' as a sort of derogatory term or insult to an idea or concept. The example I've been using lately is Freud. While he was certainly inaccurate and wildly speculative in his formation of theories regarding the human mind or psychology, it is still important, at very least in the historical context to acknowledge his attempts at furthering the field of psychology. But that said, I still think some of what he offered can be useful. Especially the id, ego, and superego. We may have more appropriate models of the 'self', many based on neurology or evolutionary psychology, but at times it may be useful to refer to Freudian concepts, even if only to illustrate using metaphor. However, I recently engaged in a discussion with a coworker who argued that use of metaphor in science is fallacious.   I guess it raises a philosophical question: At what point does human language, or literary construct begin to undermine the accuracy of science itself?  The bottom line: I find the concept of memetics useful towards game development and positioning-driven-design. I will try to find ways to adapt it to this function, since it seems well equipped so far. More books on the subject will determine its usefulness. And if the method of application is not entirely obvious after having read three books, then I will have to either A) Construct my own terms and concepts which ultimately serve the same purpose, or B) Adapt the concept of memetics for my own evil goals. :-)    Tis all for now...

         I finished Virus of the Mind by Richard Brodie. Another decent memetics book – I enjoyed the read. However, as the U2 song goes, I still haven’t found what I’m looking for. So far all the accounts of memetics of a science fail to provide adequate terms and tools for practical usage. They explain how memes work and where the idea originated, including many examples ripped straight from Richard Dawkins’ The Selfish Gene itself. But none of them discuss in any great detail how strong memes or memeplexes should be created. So far the two books I have read have left this entirely up to the reader. While I have no problem taking this on as my task in this situation, I find it a little strange that entire books dedicated to the subject matter fail to provide such insight. I will soon find out if The Electric Meme suffers from this condition as well.  On the gaming front, I’ve been playing Rise of Nations. Truly excellent RTS game – better than any I’ve ever played thus far, which is saying quite a bit in my humble opinion. First off, I’m not a fan of Blizzard RTS games and before you go screaming that I’m a blasphemer and a heretic of the RTS genre, let me explain. To put it simply, games like Warcraft and Starcraft are for the most part, action games. There are very few (if any?) successful strategies which don’t involve immediately building an army and attacking your enemy. I like at least some degree of realism in my RTS playing experience, which means that any strategy I can think of to exploit the strengths of myself or weakness of my enemy I should be ‘allowed to use’. To illustrate through example, let’s take defensive strategy tactics. If you play defensively in Warcraft III, you will be quickly crushed by your enemy’s invading forces. Why? Why are towers and other defensive units easily beaten down? Why is there little I can place in the path of invading forces which will slow or stop them? That’s not very realistic. Given, Blizzard RTS games are not known for realism, and that’s ok. What I take offense to is generic notions of unit balance – that every unit must be completely equal to another in some form or fashion. Why? Why are foot soldiers able to tear down buildings in under a minute without the aid of any kind of equipment?  Rise of Nations solves all of my complaints about the RTS genre. Defensive units actually work and mean something, providing strong lasting defense value from the invasion of enemy forces. Combine that with Home Advantage attrition rules for the enemy when they are in your territory and you have the makings of at least some semblance or realism. The ability to play sneaky with spies and snipers is another nice feature of the game. Another nice touch is the option to play the game diplomatically rather than militarily. All these little details combine to form an experience which is so much more satisfying than Blizzard or Westwood games. The bottom line is, I will be playing Rise of Nations for a long time and future RTS games will have a tough sell with me. Blizzard and Westwood can kiss my hard-earned dollars goodbye. I’m reserving them for Big Huge Games and games like Rise of Nations!  That is all for now...

         So this weekend was pretty fun and interesting. Jen and I went to the zoo on Saturday. I had a lot of fun hanging out in the primates area and watching the chimpanzees and the organgutangs. The chimps were pretty mellow and didn’t end up doing much, but the orangutangs put on a very fascinating behavioral viewing experience. It was eerie to see one of them play with a plastic bottle, filling it with water and dumping it out, then grinding it in the mud. Then a baby orangutang came along and picked up the bottle, carried it over to a rock and started ‘drawing’ with the bottle by rubbing the mud off on the rock. Even if the baby orangutang didn’t realize what it was doing, it was still eerie to see something generally regarded as an animal distinct from humans behaving in such a human-like manner. At one point somebody poured some bottled water down onto one of the males. He then squirted water out of his mouth up at the crowd. A few min later, I decided to try an experiment and see what would happen if I dumped some water down at them. The male orangutang opened his mouth and when I stopped pouring, raised his hand up in the air towards me, in what I assume was a gesture for more. Another younger orangutang came over and did the same thing, raising its hand in the air for water. I kept pouring little bits down until a member of the zoo staff told me not to do that anymore because they might get sick from water which had come in contact with humans. I found that somewhat of an ironic hypothesis, considering numerous orangutangs had urinated in the stream they liked to play in and drink from. And it’s not like I carry some kind of evil cross-species virus which could infect them. But I guess they have to take precautions, so... after that we moved about our merry way.  Jen and I have been playing some Monopoly lately. I appreciate the rules of the game much more now as an adult than when I played the game as a child. I’ve been revisiting some of the classic board games from my childhood such as Stratego and Monopoly and finding I appreciate them a lot more as an adult than I did as a child – how ironic, not what one would expect!  We saw The Core on Saturday at the $1 theater near Jen’s house. Going in I knew it was going to be bad. I was right. It was like Armageddon on steroids. Entirely ridiculous, and completely unrealistic in any fashion. So ridiculous at points that my suspension of disbelief was ruined. Some of the situations in the movie are so totally unbelievable I find it hard to imagine anyone being captivated to any great degree. I also find it amusing that actors who cared about their reputation would dare to star in the movie. I guess they’re hard up for work.  I’m almost done with Virus of the Mind. Going a little slower than I should be I guess... need to quicken the pace on books. I have one more meme book to read for the time being and then I’ll probably be moving on to evolutionary psychology with some Steven Pinker books. Nothing like a little self-education to keep one’s mind sharp. :-)

         Well not much going on lately. Ok that's not entirely true, but I always say it anyway because it seems the weeks drift by, turning into months in a sort of lazy fashion regardless of what's happening in my life. I've of course been doing lots of reading. I'm still on The Electric Meme due to some detours along the way. I borrowed the audiobook version of Good To Great from Scott Miller. Excellent stuff, right up there with Positioning & Focus concepts. It amazes me how poorly so many companies are run. When are many of these biz losers going to get it? I suppose the answer is 'never' because there's no shortage of stupidity and ignorance in the world!  Saw the X Factor: Inside The Xbox last weekend. Very interesting. I have to wonder if some of those teams Have A Clue or not? When I heard the Crimson Skies lead talk about the strengths of the game lying in similarity to Indiana Jones, with all the fabulous locations but without Indiana Jones I had to laugh out loud. What is the merit of Indiana Jones without Indiana Jones? Then you've just got some cool locations. That's certainly not enough to base an intellectual property on! I see failure on the horizon for that project! I could be wrong but it doesn't look very good. And what's with the new Oddworld game? A first-person shooter? WTF? I'd love to see Ed Fries just can that blatant defocus of Oddworld! Hey I got a great idea, let's go from Abe & Munch to a FPS game! Yeah right! Failure, failure, failure. These guys make game development look easy. Just approach Ed Fries with a turd and impress him! Microsoft must really be hurting for games!  Rise of Nations and Battlefield 1942 are still dominating my gaming sessions.   I've been neglecting my writing lately. I'm a bad boy! Ah well. It shall all be corrected very soon. I've been in a slump lately and I'm busting out of it! w00p! Holy crap though, in 8 days I turn 26 - July 2nd. I'm still a young pup but damn are the years flying by! It's strange to think that in 4 years I'll be 30. I don't see 30 as any big deal like some do. But it's one of those lifetime landmarks in terms of age. I remember being 12 and wondering what it'd be like when I was 18 or 21. I remember being 18 and wondering what it'd be like when I was 25. Now here I am wondering what it'll be like when I'm 30, looking back on 26. Life is funny like that.  Now I'm just rambling like an old codger...

       So I've been hovering under the radar lately. There's not a lot going on. Well ok, that's not entirely true. There are several noteworthy things going on, and perhaps it's merely my seemingly sedated perception of the world at times which causes me to imply that little is happening.   July 2nd marked my 26th birthday. Jennifer and I went to dinner and saw Terminator 3. Cool flick, thoroughly entertaining. Jennifer's sister Beatriz was also born on the 2nd of July, so we had a 4th of July celebration which also dually served as a birthday party for us. We went and saw fireworks. It was a fun day/evening. Jennifer found a job working for the McCarthy group, an advertising firm here in the Dallas area that focuses on automobile manufacturers. I'm proud and excited as I know she is! So yeah, lots of things have been happening.  On the personal front, I've been dealing with sleep issues. Anyone who knows me understands that I have difficulty going to sleep at a decent time like any other normal human being. I've been fighting my Night Owl Syndrome especially hard lately. I just can't seem to get to sleep before 4am. I like staying up late, but I don't like waking up in the afternoon. However, trying to go to bed prematurely is no recipe for success in my experience. My ability to stare at the ceiling for hours is quite profound.  My reading of late has been... scattered at best. I'm struggling to finish the 3rd book on memes, mainly because... well, while it is scientifically stronger than the previous books I've read, it isn't any more interesting, and as of yet (halfway point) it fails to provide a practical or utilitarian look at memes and how we might actually use them. I'm also still reading a history of philosophy. And the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. And a book about the human brain. My progress in each is slow, as one would expect with such a lack of focus. But that seems to sum up my life lately - extremely unfocused. This situation will come to a head soon, and right itself naturally as usual. Just another phase in the yearly cycle of my mind...

       So I finally finished  urlLink The Moral Animal  by Robert Wright. I also finished  urlLink On Writing Well  by William Zinsser.  It's about time, as I've spent far too long on these. The pace will quicken though--I'm about to start Blank Slate by Steven Pinker. I can't seem to get enough of evolutionary psychology.  The Moral Animal was an interesting read. It caused me to consider some points which I've overlooked too much lately--mainly that just because something is 'natural' doesn't mean we shouldn't try to change it as intelligent beings with the power to do so. Alas I've been guilty of the  urlLink naturalistic fallacy ! My fault in a naturalistic perspective has been the weakening of social ties, the formation of which have never been a strong skill of mine to begin with. But I'm also taking some of the moral ethicist philosophies of the book with a grain of salt, as Mr. Wright seems very eager to paint a happy feel-good picture of the way humanity should be. However, I do agree with him that Ev. Psych. explanations for human behavior can help us improve society via ethical and moral considerations. But enough about philosophy and psychology...  On Writing Well was an invaluable lesson in writing non-fiction. The author Zinsser embarrassingly pointed out many faults with my writing, such as the use of qualifiers like "sort of" or "kind of" that erode the strength of a person's statements. I'm also guilty in overusing passive verbs... There's too many in this update already!   Next up?  urlLink Blank Slate  by Steven Pinker. If any of you are interested in this one, I know where to get you the hardcover version for a quarter of the retail price. There's a 75% off bookstore nearby, where I found a stack selling for roughly five dollars a copy. Made me feel stupid for paying the full retail price on my copy. Anyway, if anybody is interested,  urlLink let me know .

       What role does causality play in the relationship between two pieces of information? Let's say there's a ball on a table. You have the meme ball, and the meme table. The fact that the ball is resting on the table probably doesn't mean much. But now imagine that the ball rolls off the table. An event has taken place, which in the mind and understanding are a combination of knowledge about physics and gravity. Suddenly the concept of a ball and a table take on new meaning - an interplay of events with seemingly finite consequence. In addition to merely a ball and table, we now bring the forces of motion and gravity. If we were reduce these concepts to single words, a summary of memes would look something like this: Ball, table, motion, gravity. Do these basic concepts imply the action or consequence of a ball rolling off a table? A test might be to ask a number of people what the first thing they think about or conclude when given those 4 memes. Would they automatically infer a ball rolling or falling off a table? Or would they infer something else?  The pluralism is events which happen in reality have direct conceptual correlations in the mind. If you were standing in front of the table when the ball rolled off you now have a story or sequence which you can relay to another person via communication or the transfer of information. Even though this event makes for an uninteresting story, there's the possibility that the person you tell it to could pass it along to another person, and that peson another. How these fundamental facts of the story get passed without degradation, like the child's game of 'telephone' should be the rigorous study of communication sciences, including Advertising.  More on this later...  --------    The question:   What's the FIRST thought that comes to mind when you read these words:  Ball, table, motion, gravity.  ?     Some results to the experiment:   *"Dropping a ball on a mirrored table angled at 40 degrees, and watching it bounce off it. Just the ball dropping onto the mirror and bouncing off. No explanation beyond."  *"The first clear thought is having a brick dropped on your nuts. Then I think of dropping a ball on a table."  *"Ball rolling off of table"  *"Pool/billiards"  *"Pool."  *"Pool"  *"Pool, then Rollercoaster"  *"Pinball"  *"Ping-pong"  *"Moon"  *"Those little clacky balls people have on their desks." (Newton's Cradle)  * "Isaac Newton"  *"Newton"  *"Newton"  *"Energy"  *"Grapes"  *"Anchor"  *"Chair"  *"Bong"  *"A falling piano"  *"Influence. Gravity would have influence on all the other objects."     Statistics:   3 out of 20 (15%) people made a literal association of ball bouncing or rolling.  7 out of 20 (35%) made a topical association to a game, toy,  or entertainment such as billiards or ping pong, or a Newton's Cradle.  7 answers (35%) were related to the topic gravity.  3 answers (15%) associated seemingly random or unrelated physical objects such as grapes, bong, and chair.   Summary Statistics by Percentage:   70% made a topical association.   15% made a literal association.  15% made seemingly random or unrelated association to words representing physical objects that were not part of the original list.    Deductions:   *Some subjects used the combination of words to make a topical association (billiards, pinball, Newton, influence of gravity on objects).  *Some pictured a literal consequence of combining the words (ball dropping).  *Some made random or unrelated associations.    Axioms:   *Without a context for information, a person will create one.  *Context is defined one of two ways:  1) Topical association  2) Literal causal relationship between the words.  *The combination of words is more important than individual words themselves, regardless of the value placed on individual words.  *Multiple definitions of a word can lead a person to define a certain context when one isn't provided, such as the word ball causing phallic associations with testicle.

       My insular world has a depressing, self-corrupting nature to it, which I despise. There are moments when I realize I simply am not smart enough, or know enough to solve the problems of my field in any clearly intelligible fashion. At times like these, I want to go to sleep. To sleep with the hope that perhaps upon waking I will have some clear solution to the problems and a definite course of action.  I've been working on the relationships between different forces, different sets of data. The relationship between two pieces of data is far more important than the two pieces themselves. In other words, greater than the sum of parts--this much is obvious. However, exactly how is it greater than the sum of parts? What is the operation being performed in the combination of the two. Is it addition? Is it multiplication? Alternatively, is it an exponential factor imbued by the process of combination? This depends on the individual pieces of data in question. Surely, there must be a constant and standard operation for combinatorial logic? Given that any two pieces of data are equal, what is the standard operation, which provides the combinatorial sum?  Perhaps my mind and logic have failed me and I'm looking for a solution to a problem which is entirely relative. It is easy to reference gravity or electromagnetism and their corresponding theories of general relativity, etc. Nevertheless, these theories have basis in the forces of nature, with provable constants. The subject of information or ideas is merely theoretical, so the question becomes from where would such a constant arise? How do you define a constant among and endless torrent of subjective ideas and their exponential combinations? Can there be one? Where does the pattern emerge? Intuition tells me explanations come from the sciences of networks and complexity. I should review my notes on these subjects soon.

       Been playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City a lot lately. I must say I'm enjoying it far more than the original GTA3. Having businesses is thoroughly addicting... constantly making the rounds to collect cash. The game is still unforgiveable in it's difficulty on certain missions, and I wish they'd just stop with the timed mission crap. It's not that the average gamer isn't capable of replaying a mission... it's that they WON'T WANT TO. That said, the game is still a lot of fun. It's too bad some were turned off by GTA3's difficulty. Vice City is a little easier, and has a wider variety of elements like running businesses, and buying up property around the city.  Still Reading Prisoner's Dilemma. About halfway through. Don't understand how 'science-read' peeps always try to distance Game Theory from Game Design. "Oh they're two separate subjects entirely!" Yes, they are... but they needn't be. After all, it's obvious that the field title Game Theory is aptly named from games of 'strategy conflict'. Funny (though not suprising) that few in the game industry know anything about the subject. Blah blah blah.  Been revisiting Writer's Journey again... this time arranging some of the info in Personal Brain. Some things were just meant to be arranged that way... ;-)  Ordered some more books from Amazon... I'm such a gluttonous book hog!    Been thinking about emergence and networked complexity some more. I ordered a couple more books on the subject... I think the only books I haven't read so far. After this I'm out of luck on new material until somebody writes it. ;-)

       What's the deal lately? Been obsessed with getting micro-projects done. Last night I started combing through some old hard drives from about 6 years ago. I'm backing up any items I feel are significant, and then I'm wiping the drives clean. It really is Digital Archeology. It's funny how much of a mark as a person you leave on your computer. Just by viewing the files on my hard drive at the time, I can tell what was going on 4-6 years ago. In addition to a lot of Quake 2 level design files, I found a plethora of half-baked (and half-recorded) songs, and sound design material. The question becomes, how am I going to feel about this stuff when I'm 50 years old? By then I should have a decent collection of old hard drive material!!!  On a related note, I've been somewhat obsessive over projects lately. Been meaning to work on our yard for the last 2 weeks and for one reason or another have always been barred from doing so. Getting a little frustrated, so I'm committed this weekend to work on things around the house and NOBODY IS GOING TO STOP ME! Also, the digital archiving of my old hard drives is taking longer than expected. I started at 9 or 10pm last night and before long I looked at the clock to notice it was 2am. I looked at the clock a short time later and it was 4am. But that's also because I got sidetracked trying to install WinXP on my old Dell machine for Jennifer. Tired of the Win2K and I'd really just like to wipe that drive clean... which I still need to do.  I also started putting up numerous game posters I've had for years in the office. Makes the room less boring. At some point I need to install some wall shelves in there and bring a few of my lava lamps and decorations home from work. Need to spread the gaming decor!!!  Also a bit dismayed as my reading has slowed down considerably. Yes I'm still stuck on Guns, Germs, & Steel and also Influence. I've just been too distracted by projects and other things going on. Funny how when you get lots of projects going at once they all seem to slow down. ;-)  I need to finish playing Ninja Gaiden, but in talking to a coworker I'm not even halfway through the game!!!  And then there's the rebuilding of the pond waterfall, blah blah blah. It never ends! This stuff could be a full time job. Too bad it doesn't pay!!! I guess the best way to describe my life right now is 'project fragmented'.

       I usually think about potentialities and opportunities endlessly in mind before, if ever, doing them. I often get ideas for projects or ways to make money and by the time I'm done turning it over in my head thousands of times, I lose interest and motivation and the idea fades away.  Lately I've reversed this attitude. Not the thinking mind you, I'm still churning through lots of stuff on a daily basis but with one noteable difference; I'm acting upon a lot of these thoughts and ideas more.  I've been wanting a cd/mp3 player for my car well over a year now. I'd always been reluctant to spend the money, and then one weekend, I just went and bought it and had it installed. Now I'm cramming in twice as many books each money by getting audio versions and listening in the car. This is great for a couple reasons: 1) It increases my reading productivity 2) More importantly, I have a greater quantity and variety of new concepts and ideas available to me as a result of this influx of knowledge and information.  Projects I've had in mind for months I've now started busting out with regularity.  The cause? I'm tired of this lingering sensation that nothing ever gets done.  The benefits? I've noticed the more backlogged projects I compulsively and obsessively do the closer I get to a sort of 'critical mass' of change within my life. I'm not quite there yet but I can sense the more I get done, quite literally takes shape as a transformation of my environment. These changes induce positive feedback into my environment and therefore onto me, which further motivate me to finish yet even more projects. I no longer have to worry about feeling motivated because the completion of these projects provides motivation for further accomplishment.  And this is how the "just do it" attitude is positively shaping my future.  Other things I've done this month (or recently):  Started Taekwondo. Picked up level design again. Begun organizing years' worth of backlogged financial papers. Organizing old items I've collected throughout the years. Started a savings account and making regular deposits to it. Planning out future projects. Started writing more diligently.  Some future projects?  Rebuild pond waterfall. Install stone paver patio below retaining wall in our backyard. Write and record some music. Print, frame, and sell some of my photographs as well as decorate our house with them. Get rid of unneeded junk piling up around the house.  We'll see what happens in the months to come.

        The unity of everything.  Everything including the entire universe is a large collection of intermeshed networks. Events occur as cascade effects in the networks, propogating on/off  states through the networks. Fads, waves, mass hysteria, motion, ripples all occur from many nodes in a network all entering a certain state around or at the same time. This synchronization is largely responsible for not only history  but the future as well  – how things happen. What’s very inspiring about understanding and having a deep knowledge of these principles is that you’ll have the power to make things happen. If you see yourself as a node in a network, all you have to do is  tweak the network variables  to get whatever kind of result you’re looking for...   Patterns.  Patterns are important to recognize everywhere around you, and to fully understand causality—cause and effect. The problem with the human brain and why many people get stuck in life or fail to understand how or why things are  the way they are  is because they get their causality mixed up. They see  effects as causes, and causes as effects.  If you’re problem-solving, doesn’t it seem dangerous to mis-label an effect as a cause and vice versa? But we, in our human fallibility,  do this every day.  Often when looking at problems we label symptoms as the causes of that problem. Take illness for example.  “I’ve got this stupid runny nose which is making my week hell!”  No, you’ve got a cold virus which is giving you a runny nose so that you’ll get snot on your hands, arms, clothing, or whatever else and spread it to others, who will then also get runny noses and start spreading the cold germs elsewhere. Point: The runny nose isn’t the cause of your illness, but it  will be the cause of illness for many others.  Here we have a feedback loop within a network. The cold virus invades a person’s bloodstream. It tries to take over and multiply. One symptom is a runny nose, which spreads via the external body the cold virus to another person’s bloodstream inevitably. Virii, a network of their own, hitchhike on another network—human society or human social interaction, in order to spread themselves. When viewing it this way, it’s  easy to see the causation.  Yet people will still insist they got sick from being outside in the cold too long, and then open a window because  the room feels stuffy.   People are strange.   The human mind did not evolve to understand the universe. Understanding is a byproduct of the real purpose our brains evolved –  survival.  Somewhere along the way, between finding our next meal, building tools so that we could build shelters, and build more tools so we could  find our next meal,  we discovered that we could also figure out a little bit about how mother nature built  her tools , including ours truly,  human beings.  It’s a wonderful byproduct. But it’s still just a byproduct. I doubt I’m saying anything shocking by stating we’re better at picking berries or killing a deer than we are at  figuring out black holes or how the universe formed.    Abstraction.  Because our minds are not built to understand nature as easily, we need all the  shortcuts  and help we can get. Shortcuts and help would be viewing nature and its processes as systems or  networks.  If we can look at everything in terms of systems or networks, then all we need to do is discover some  fundamental principles of all networks,  and we’ll have a pretty good idea of how each and  every network operates in it’s own context.   This is the power of abstraction.   Lately I’ve been viewing everything as a network.  Everything.  Physics, biology, software creation, game design, even my library of books at home is a network. It’s a network of knowledge. Some of the books overlap, some of them don’t.  Most of them do in some way, even if that way is small.  Each information overlap is a  link between two networks.  The subject of psychology leads to the brain which leads biology which leads to evolution which believe it or not, leads to business because businesses are just macro-individuals  fighting for survival in a larger context.  Even something as plain as water, is a network. It’s a network of water molecules. At 32 degrees farenheit, a few molecules will freeze, which trigger the other molecules around them to freeze,  which trigger the other molecules around them to freeze.  Soon the  entire body  of water is frozen. But typically we just see water as a singular unit –  “THE water”  or  “A lake”  or  “A pond”.  In our everyday lives we do not perceive networks. They are the  hidden order , the hidden  structure  we miss and ignore. It’s only when we start to feel that our lives and world is entirely too  chaotic  that  our own ignorance becomes apparent.  Absolutely everything around us in our lives, our communities, our planet, our solar system, and our universe is just a collection of parts, like parts in a machine, or better yet— a big organic blob.   But it’s not a blob.   Everything is divisible and multipliable.  We only see a blob because we  ignore the strands, pieces, threads, and parts that make up the fabric of reality.  Whoever first coined “the fabric of reality” probably didn’t even realize the depth of that definition.  Reality is a fabric.  And a very complicated finely woven one at that. But it  doesn’t have to be complex or complicated in our understanding of it.  All we have to do is abstract. Pull back to the birds-eye view, take a good look and see the features, the landscape – and more importantly, the landmarks. By looking at things holistically, from the big picture view, we understand how individual parts make up the whole. We understand systems. As a result,  we understand life.

       Communication is a really funny thing. With most people, it speeds things up, gets people interested,  entertains a dialogue  between two people which leaves both feeling a sense of common bond. There are some unique individuals in this world though, who favor outgoing communication to incoming communication. You know who I'm talking about--those people who  never hear a word you say , and are simply waiting for their chance to speak, or worse--cutting you off in midsentence  to squeeze in their authoritative stance on a subject.   About a month ago, I was listening to the  urlLink 7 Habits of Highly Effective People . I take a lot of these self-improvement type books with a grain of salt. A lot of what they say is  cheesey rhetoric to make people feel better, or like they've found the solution to their problems in life.  But also sometimes there are nuggets of  pure gold truth , which makes listening to self-improvement topic all about  separating the wheat from the chaff.   One of the nuggets I picked up from 7 Habits is that if you want to be more effective at communication,  you really have to listen to people.  At first this struck me as  stupidly obvious.   "Duh, of course!"  I thought as I made my way down the road while listening to the book in my car. But as Stephen Covey went on to explain further, I began to realize that most people (including myself) only  partially listen,  or  superficially listen  to what people have to say. You hear another person's words, but you don't give the meaning of those words  enough time  to sink in before responding. Instead you jump to your response as soon as the other individual has finished their last word of sentence.  We're all guilty of this at one time or another.  In an attempt to better myself I started tracking this 'bad habit', and noticing it was true. Since I've made this change I've been better at listening to what people have to say. Sometimes you can get people to pour their heart out by  merely showing interest  in their mundane everyday comments. The results are often suprising. In the last few weeks I've had many serious, face-to-face talks with people I know and not only do you learn a lot about the person, but you also begin to see opportunities.  But where some see opportunities,  others see threats.  Some people will clamp and shut down communications if they feel it's a threat to their authority or the  fuzzy ambiguity of principles by which they live.  I've never understood this tendency...  what does communication hurt?  It's as if such people have an inner will to  remove peoples' mouths.   They don't want to hear. They don't want to listen. They don't want to communicate.   Lately I've come to view communication in the opposite light -  the more the better.  Even to the point where other people feel it's noise,  the existence and availability of information should never be taken for granted.  I've seen some people lately questioning the worth of blogs, or figuring it a mindless fad which just creates more 'noise' on the web.  What does it matter?  As if the web weren't already a big cluster of  data-smog?  Pop-ups are annoying, but what do I care about somebody posting personal thoughts on their own webspace?  If I don't like it, I don't have to read it.   I will go further though. I look at increased communication as increased network traffic.  A busy, bustling, active network is a healthy one.  Thousands upon thousands of blogs out there means that thousands and thousands of people are sharing their thoughts and communicating. Not everyone, because some don't share their blogs with others, but there are many that do. And for those that do, they probably get something worthwhile out of doing it, otherwise they wouldn't be doing it.  More power to them.   As for my interest in networks, I like the idea of random links, more links, more links.  Connections everywhere.  Blogs increase that. The global brain is growing, and I don't think that's a bad thing.  It means greater rapid idea diffusion.  In a sedentary society born upon advanced food production techniques, where there's room for individuals to specialize, invent, and innovate, rapid and growing information transfer can only be a good thing. In the next hundred years, we're going to see further explosions of art, invention, and creativity. Many people will prosper.  The standard of living for everyone could be raised purely due to the increased speed of idea diffusion.  If communication enables idea diffusion, and blogs enable communication, then  blog away!

       Last week George (my boss) cracked down on team hours. I guess people have been drifting all over the place since until now things have been pretty lax. George got fed up with this and decided to institute some order. We have two shifts now, 9:00am to 7:00pm, or 2:00pm to 12:00am.  Being that I enjoy life, my wife, and evening hours I chose the 9am shift. I had already been on this shift for quite a while, but  not quite as rigorous  about getting in when the clock struck 9. Now I am.  So I've been having to go to sleep earlier, and wake up earlier. It's had a strange effect on me.  Could it truly be the end of my late night game playing sessions?  Ah, the death of a lifestyle always hurts--especially one that's so relevant to my job--video games.  I'm not complaining, just making an observation. It seems in the game industry there's a strong clash between 'normal' life and nerd gamer anti-social life. Since getting married, for me the two worlds have collided in a violent conflict. Every once in a while I stay up all night playing games, but out of necessity those opportunities are becoming fewer and fewer. I'm not opposed to either lifestyle, as I enjoy both. But I find the battle between the two to be  laying waste to my mind  at times. I can't have it both ways. I can't have my cake and eat it too. Anybody who knows me by now well understands that such dichotomatic conflicts do not sit well with me. One way or another, I get to eat my cake. Yet this seems to be a conflict where there is no resolution.  I'm not going to stop playing games late into the night.  But I have to maintain a normal schedule. The result?  Lately I've been losing sleep, and making it up the next night. Stay up later one night, go to bed early the next night.  Repeat. Wash. Rinse.   These subtle shifts in my daily bio-rythyms have a strange effect on my pyschological disposition which have led me to discover something interesting about myself that I've never really focused on or admitted; I love danger. Not the edge of life,  "I almost died"  kind of danger. But I enjoy danger in more subtle forms. I break rules  just to gauge reaction.  Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing this.  I test The System.  Sometimes I do irresponsible things. Not because I fail to understand causation, but because the reverse is true--I enjoy the causation that results from my testing the system.  When I was younger, working regular crap jobs like Nordstroms, Mervyn's, Borders, etc. I would think nothing of just up and quitting one day, or walking off the job. I have a low tolerance for everday mundane mediocrity, and have no qualms about turning a cold shoulder to it. The same day I quit my night shift janitor job at Nordstroms, I bought  my  first PC on  $3000 in credit.  Why would any sane person with a crap low-paying job take out $3K in credit upon having just quit that job?  Because they want more from life.  At the time (and even now)  I didn't see it as a risk.   I saw it as an opportunity.  I wanted to start using and learning everything I could about computers immediately. Considering the job I have today working on computer games, it was ironically  a wise choice.  Conventional wisdom never would have told me to buy a computer upon quitting my job.  But conventional wisdom didn't get me where I am today.   When people tell me to zig,  I zag.  I have problems with authority. Not in the outlandish,  punch-a-cop-in-the-face  type of problem with authority, but like the other examples, a more subtle challenging of authority. When a boss tells me to do something a certain way, I'll try to find a better way to do it. Why?  Because I enjoy challenges.  Following the rules or what people tell me to do is boring.  Many times in my life this has gotten me in trouble. Take for example, my first job in the game industry at Electronic Arts. I got in a lot of trouble there. EA is a very strict corporate place, and I was constantly challenging the authority of my bosses. I questioned why things were done certain ways. I even went above the heads of my bosses a couple times. Looking back, some of what I did was  very stupid.  But at the same time I can't help but admire my naive honesty in trying to improve things or create a challenge for myself. That very nature has gotten me where I am today, working at 3D Realms as a sound designer.  The irony is I used to hate being on time at 10am for work at EA. Now I willingly show up at 9am for work at 3DR, a 'corporate culture' (don't even like calling it that) as far from EA as you can possibly get. What is happening to me?  You could say I fit in here. Maybe too well. Why's that one might ask?  Because 3D Realms doesn't follow the rules.  They don't follow conventional wisdom. They do things which other companies would consider a disaster, extremely dangerous, or downright stupid. We don't schedule or plan projects here. We just do them. And they're done when they're done. In many ways that's very fitting to my personality.  Last year I got married to my sweetheart Jennifer. We bought a house together. In the next couple years we may be starting a family. Life has changed. Life has changed a lot. And it's still changing. It's not change I have a problem with. In this case, it's the  type of change  being requested of me. Eric needs to follow conventional wisdom. Eric needs to obey authority. Eric needs to follow the rules.   Or does he?

        I’m not going to talk about E3.  There are enough industry bloggers out there already doing that. Besides, I didn’t go to E3, and in general I don’t really care about the demos and presentations.  I want to play the games.  Instead, I’m going to talk about games which may or may not arrive in the 2004-2005 year and  what they’ll have to offer.     Fable  – an RPG where you control your own destiny. A novel concept. Not really, but the  execution of it very well might be.  Any time the player is allowed to play in their own style, and see how their style of play affects the game-world, I'm going to sit up and take notice. And my bet is other gamers will too.  Sandboxes aren’t just a fad these days.  As game developers we’re growing up and realizing that  games aren’t just about enforcing designer rules upon the player.  Some people don’t pay $50 to walk a straight line or play by the rules. They pay $50 to have fun and make their own gaming experience.   Black & White 2  – Many people were underwhelmed by Black & White, yet millions bought and played it anyway. The critical error seems to be lack of goals or structure within the game.  And it was too hard.  Most people I knew quit by the 4th world, out of  difficulty. Molyneux  seems  like a smart enough leader not to let it happen again. But we’ll see. At first I questioned bringing soldiers and walls into the game. But with a  huge creature to command,  one can already picture what kind of  hilarious mayhem  will ensue.   The Sims 2  – Will a better, prettier incarnation of The Sims be enough to sway millions to part with $50,  after they’ve already spent $200-$300 buying addons for the original?  If the sequel offers as much as the addons for the original did, then maybe. If not... then danger might be lurking in the  dark mindshare of gamers everywhere.  That said, I’ll still buy the game. Mr. Wright is a pretty smart guy, and I’m curious to see what him and his crew have to offer.   GTA San Andreas  – L.A., San Francisco, AND Las Vegas? Talk about  swallowing the steak whole.  I’m confident Rockstar can deliver. They’re on a path that seems difficult to screw up. Being there is no GTA-Killer yet (and probably won’t be), Rockstar will do just fine to incrementally improve upon previous versions. But they seem to be  kicking it up a notch  each time.   The future for Sandbox Gameplay looks bright.  Now where’s the great characters and story?  Our industry still sucks at such elements.  I want to play a game that will make me cry.  Something tells me I’ll be waiting a long time.  Doom 3 and Half-Life 2 of course. That’s a given. I don’t have to say much about these as they speak for themselves.  Mindless action fodder.  Great. Shovel another spoonful in my mouth,  like a handful of greasy popcorn at the movie theater.  Don’t get me wrong, I love it. I just find it amusing we wait 4+ years for 20 hours of popcorn testosterone fluff.  And the fact that a truly great FPS only comes out once every 5-7 years.  Somebody break the cycle! In the meantime I’ll be hovering in other genres.  That makes me want to talk about development processes and the need for increased efficiency. Maybe in a future blog...

       For the last few months a friend and I had been playing with a program called  urlLink Personal Brain . Lately we've been using  urlLink something better . Mind Manager is quite a bit more robust, with the added bonus of being able to publish your information to the web. It's a great brainstorming and organizational tool.  I've been using it to organize some of my thoughts, notes, and also to quickly develop concept material. In pondering the nature of this software, I have to wonder about the future. Perhaps years from now we'll all be running personal simulations to see if our ideas could or would be successful? Will it be possible to have business simulators? What about business games? I'm suprised there isn't anything like this yet...   My writing has slowed down... will correct this soon. Just need to organize my notes more, perhaps Mind Manager will help with that as soon as I get a lazy weekend to start hammering away.

       Been dissecting intellectual properties lately, and found that the good ones often have something in common. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Matrix? Yes they all have things in common. My pattern recognition circuits are at full capacity, taking in all the data. Don't worry, there will be fruition on the subject.   Saw Chronicles of Riddick over the weekend. What a pleasant suprise... they sure pulled that intellectual property out of nowhere, didn't they? And here I thought Pitch Black was vague about universe details, just for the sake of ambiguity. I suppose that initial ambiguity offered them a lot of opportunities when it came time for the second movie. Not a fan of the whole Stargate archaic-looking spaceships, but hey it twas fine I suppose. It's not like I expected Tie Fighters or anything. ;-)  I finished  urlLink Change Agents  by Liz Nickels. Although I did manage to find a few quoteable sections, overall the book left me feeling as if I hadn't really learned anything. I'm now reading  urlLink Flow  by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. What a name! Makes me feel better about mine. Anyhow, tis an excellent book primarily because it covers a problem I've dealt with for many years--focus. I have a problem with... attention. I tend to focus on whatever is most interesting to me at that particular moment. Call it a character flaw, but I don't have much patience for things that bore me. The problem comes in when the 'thing that bores me' happens to be something important, like a task at work, or some chore sorely in need of completion at home. Flow is helping me with this as it describes 'states of optimal experience' that many people have had, how and why they have them. My favorite part is the author addresses the subject from a scientifically literate perspective. In other words it's not a bunch of wishy washy self-help crap. I know at least a few game developers with similar... attention problems, perhaps  urlLink Flow  can help them.  The book also explains immersion in games, and why games are popular in culture--or better yet, how games compare to culture itself as this excerpt demonstrates:   It is in this respect that games provide a compelling analogy to cultures. Both consist of more or less arbitrary goals and rules that allow people to become involved in a process and act with a minimum of doubts and distractions. The difference is mainly one of scale. Cultures are all-embracing: they specify how a person should be born, how she should grow up, marry, have children, and die. Games fill out the interludes of the cultural script. They enhance action and concentration during “free time,” when cultural instructions offer little guidance, and a person’s attention threatens to wander into the uncharted realms of chaos.   Good stuff! Lots of bookmarks in this one already. Will report more when I'm finished.

       There is a section in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's book  urlLink Flow  I found relevant to games and entertainment in general:     The Elements of Enjoyment   •	 A Challenging Activity That Requires Skill   By far the overwhelming proportion of optimal experiences are reported to occur within sequences of activities that are goal-directed and bound by rules—activities that require the investment of psychic energy, and that could not be done without the appropriate skills.   •	 Merging of Action and Awareness   When all a person’s relevant skills are needed to cope with the challenges of a situation, that person’s attention is completely absorbed by the activity. There is no excess psychic energy left over to process any information but what the activity offers. All the attention is concentrated on the relevant stimuli.  As a result, one of the most universal and distinctive features of optimal experience takes place: people become so involved in what they are doing that the activity becomes spontaneous, almost automatic; they stop being aware of themselves as separate from the actions they are performing.   •	 Clear Goals and Feedback   The reason it is possible to achieve such complete involvement in a flow experience is that the goals are usually clear, and feedback immediate. Of course if one chooses a trivial goal, success in it does not provide enjoyment.   •	 Concentration on the Task at Hand   One of the most frequently mentioned dimensions of the flow experience is that, while it lasts, one is able to forget all the unpleasant aspects of life. This feature of flow is an important by-product of the fact that enjoyable activities require a complete focusing of attention on the task at hand—thus leaving no room in the mind for irrelevant information.  In normal everyday existence, we are the prey of thoughts and worries intruding unwanted in consciousness. Because most jobs, and home life in general, lack the pressing demands of flow experiences, concentration is rarely so intense that preoccupations and anxieties can be automatically ruled out. Consequently the ordinary state of mind involves the unexpected and frequent episodes of entropy interfering with the smooth run of psychic energy. This is one reason why flow improves the quality of experience: the clearly structured demands of the activity impose order, and exclude the interference of disorder in consciousness.   •	 Paradox of Control   The flow experience is typically described as involving  a sense of control—or, more precisely, as lacking the sense of worry about losing control  that is typical in many situations of normal life.   What respondents are actually describing  is the possibility, rather than the actuality, of control.   The sense of control is also reported in enjoyable activities that involve serious risks, activities that to an outsider would seem to be much more potentially dangerous than the affairs of normal life. People who practice hang-gliding, spelunking, rock climbing, race-car driving, deep-sea diving, and many similar sports for fun are purposefully placing themselves in situations  that lack the safety nets of civilized life.   The important thing to realize here is that activities that produce flow experiences, even the seemingly most risky ones, are so constructed as to allow the practitioner to develop sufficient skills to reduce the margin of error to as close to zero as possible.    •	 Loss of Self-Consciousness   Preoccupation with the self consumes psychic energy because in everyday life we often feel threatened. Whenever we are threatened we need to bring the image we have of ourselves back into awareness, so we can find out whether or not the threat is serious, and how we should meet it. Hundreds of times every day we are reminded of the vulnerability of our self. And every time this happens psychic energy is lost trying to restore order to consciousness.  But in flow there is no room for self-scrutiny. Because enjoyable activities have clear goals, stable rules, and challenges well matched to our skills, there is little opportunity for the self to be threatened.   •	 Transformation of Time   Time no longer seems to pass the way it ordinarily does. The objective, external duration we measure with reference to outside events like night and day, or the orderly progression of clocks, is rendered irrelevant by the rhythms dictated by the activity.    Perhaps these are elements game designers should be aware of?

       I haven't had time to pull notes from my recent reading list, so I thought I'd examine an older issue ( and some older notes! ) in the hopes of maybe sparking some discussion.  A fellow game developer recently stated:   "I think there's a big problem between the theory of games and the practice of making good games; it seems very hard for people to sit back and objectively make good decisions on their own game creations."    Granted, some developers are  just blundering idiots.  Being an optimist I'd like to think much of developer ignorance is due to a  lack of guidelines, principles, and terms  by which all of us could design better games.   With that in mind, I responded:  "There is an awful lot of observable low-level data which could be used to form solid principles of game design, however much of that data has yet to be collected, culled, organized into higher level abstract, and easily readable form--books or articles. This is where we should all lament the state of game journalism, both on the casual and technical level."   Without further ado I present something Steven Pinker said in his book  urlLink How the Mind Works ...    "Such laboratory legerdemain has revealed that the human brain uses at least four major formats of representation. One format is the  visual image , which is like a template in a two-dimensional, picture like mosaic. Another is a  phonological representation , a stretch of syllables that we play in our minds like a tape loop, planning out the mouth movements and imagining what the syllables sound like. This string like representation is an important component of our short-term memory, as when we look up a phone number and silently repeat it to ourselves just long enough to dial the number. Phonological short-term memory lasts between one and five seconds and can hold from four to seven “chunks”. (Short-term memory is measured in chunks rather than sounds because each item can be a label that points to a much bigger information structure in long-term memory, such as the content of a phrase or sentence.) A third format is the  grammatical representation:  nouns and verbs, phrases and clauses, stems and roots, phonemes and syllables, all arranged into hierarchical trees. In The Language Instinct I explained how these representations determine what goes into a sentence and how people communicate and play with language.  The fourth format is  mentalese , the language of thought in which our conceptual knowledge is couched. When you put down a book, you forget almost everything about the wording and typeface of the sentences and where they sat on the page. What you take away is their content or gist. (In memory tests, people confidently “recognize” sentences they never saw if they are paraphrases of the sentences they did see.) Mentalese is the medium in which content or gist is captured; I used bits of it in the bulletin board of the production system that identified uncles, and in the “knowledge” and “concept” levels of the semantic network shown in the last diagram. Mentalese is also the mind’s lingua franca, the traffic of information among mental modules that allows us to describe what we see, imagine what is described to us, carry out instructions, and so on. This traffic can actually be seen in the anatomy of the brain. The hippocampus and connected structures, which put our memories into long-term storage, and the frontal lobes, which house the circuitry for decision-making, are not directly connected to the brain areas that processes raw sensory input (the mosaic of edges and colors and the ribbon of changing pitches. Instead, most of the input fibers carry what neuroscientists call “highly processed” input coming from regions one or more stops downstream from the first sensory areas. The input consists of codes for objects, words, and other complex concepts."    Knowledge of how the mind works can not only help in the design of games, but also in the creation of guidelines and literature on how games are best made. Perhaps developers need  grammatical representation  and an easily communicated  mentalese  for game development?
